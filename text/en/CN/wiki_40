<text>Juergen Teller (born 28 January 1964) is a German fine-art and fashion photographer. He was awarded the Citibank Prize for Photography in 2003 and received the Special Presentation International Center of Photography Infinity Award in 2018.

Major solo exhibitions of his work have been organised at Fondation Cartier pour l’art Contemporain, Paris (2006); Le Consortium, Dijon, France (2010); Dallas Contemporary, TX (2011); Daelim Museum, Seoul (2011); Institute of Contemporary Art, London (2013); Contemporary Fine Arts, Berlin (2015); Kunsthalle Bonn, Germany (2016), Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow (2018), Grand Palais Éphémère, Paris (2023). Self-portraiture has been a prominent feature of his practice and was the main focus of his &#x27;Macho&#x27; exhibition at DESTE Foundation, Athens, Greece (2014).

==Education==
Teller studied at the Bayerische Staatslehranstalt für Photographie in Munich, Germany (1984–1986). In order to avoid military national service he learned English and moved to London in 1986, aged 22.

==Career==
Since the beginning his career in the late 1980s, Teller has blurred the boundaries between his commissioned and personal work in his numerous campaigns, editorials, publications and exhibitions. Teller treats all of his subjects—family members, celebrities, and himself with a uniform style of grit, raw emotion and humour that has become his iconic and recognizable aesthetic.

His photographs have appeared in &quot;Arena Homme +,&quot; &quot;The Face,&quot; &quot;i-D,&quot; &quot;032c,&quot; &quot;Pop,&quot; &quot;Purple,&quot; &quot;Self Service,&quot; &quot;W,&quot; &quot;Vogue&quot; (American, Australian, British, French, Italian, Japanese, Polish) and &quot;Zeit magazin&quot; among others. He photographed Kylie Minogue for the artwork of her 1991 album Let&#x27;s Get to It. Teller first gained wider recognition in 1996 with his front cover of &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazine&quot; featuring a nude Kristen McMenamy with the word ‘Versace’ drawn in a heart across her chest.

In 1997, Marc Jacobs worked with Teller&#x27;s then-partner, Venetia Scott to style his collections and Teller shot Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth for the Spring Summer 1998 campaign. 

For the brand&#x27;s 2005 campaign, he photographed himself with Cindy Sherman and also collaborated with Winona Ryder, Sofia Coppola, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Stipe, Rufus Wainwright and Harmony Korine amongst others until the SS2014 campaign. Teller has also collaborated with a range of other designers and fashion houses during his career, including Helmut Lang, Yves Saint Laurent, Vivienne Westwood, Céline, Missoni, Moschino, Barney&#x27;s, Louis Vuitton, Adidas, Palace and Valentino.

Teller has photographed many celebrities, musicians, artists and photographers, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, O. J. Simpson, Kurt Cobain, Bjork, Kate Moss, Elton John, Joan Didion, Pelé, David Hockney, Roni Horn, Sarah Lucas, William Eggleston, Boris Mikhailov and Araki Nobuyoshi. He photographed American rapper Kanye West for &quot;&quot; and shot the &#x27;Kanye, Juergen and Kim&#x27; supplement for System featuring Kanye West and Kim Kardashian as well as himself in 2015. The actress Charlotte Rampling has been a long term collaborator, appearing in Teller&#x27;s &quot;Louis XV&quot; series which was exhibited at Contemporary Fine Arts, Berlin and published by Steidl as a book in 2005, and the &quot;Paradis&quot; photographs shot at Musée du Louvre in 2009.

Teller has directed several fashion films, short films and artist videos including &quot;Can I Own Myself&quot; (1998), &quot;Go-Sees&quot; (2001), &quot;World Cup Final, Germany 0 Brazil 2 London&quot; (2002), &quot;Schmetterling&quot;&#x27; (2005) and &quot;Dieter&quot; (2017).

===Teaching===
Teller was Professor of Photography at the Academy of Fine Arts in Nuremberg from 2014 to 2019.

===Curating===

<text>Albert Samuel Gatschet (October 3, 1832, Beatenberg, Canton of Bern – March 16, 1907, Washington, D.C.) was a Swiss-American ethnologist who trained as a linguist in the universities of Bern and Berlin. He later moved to the United States and settled there in order to study Native American languages, a field in which he was a pioneer.

In 1877 he became an ethnologist with the US Geological Survey. In 1879 he became a member of the Bureau of American Ethnology, which was part of the Smithsonian Institution. In 1884, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Gatschet published his observations of the Karankawa people of Texas. His study of the Klamath people located in present-day Oregon, published in 1890, is recognized as outstanding. In 1902 Gatschet was elected as a member of the American Antiquarian Society, whose members were studying ancient and historic peoples.

<doc id="1242665" wikidata="Q3656426" url="?curid=1242665" title="Triangle of Death (Iraq)">
<text>The Triangle of Death is a name given to a region south of Baghdad during the 2003–2011 occupation of Iraq by the U.S. and allied forces which saw major combat activity and sectarian violence from early 2003 into the fall of 2007.

==Description==
The &quot;Triangle of Death&quot; (not to be confused with the much larger Sunni Triangle further north) lies between Baghdad and Al Hillah, is inhabited by one million mostly Sunni civilians, and contains several large towns in the Mahmudiya District including Yusufiyah, Mahmoudiyah, Iskandariyah, Latifiyah and Jurf Al Sakhar and hundreds of rural villages. The major terrain feature of the Triangle of Death is the Euphrates River, which borders the Triangle to the southwest. The terrain is mostly farmland, but is sliced by many irrigation ditches. These farms are usually small, being maintained by the families that own the land. The weather is generally consistent with the rest of Iraq, except for increased humidity due to the area&#x27;s proximity to the Euphrates River and irrigation canals used for farming.

Musayyib is home to the Musayyib Power Plant, which was a frequent target of insurgent attacks due to its infrastructure importance. The power plant would be capable of supplying between one quarter and one third of Iraq&#x27;s electricity demands if it were fully operational. In October 2006, it was at roughly 33% of its maximum potential output. Because of the indirect fire attacks on the facility, and the kidnapping of American soldiers to the area, U.S. forces occupied Patrol Base Dragon (formerly known as FOB Chosin) on the grounds of the power plant. Attacks diminished due to increased security in 2007 and with an overall increase in the security situation of Babil Governorate in 2008, the facility was closed as a U.S. base.

==Sociological causes of violence==
Analysts generally attributed this area&#x27;s high level of violence to the tension between the majority Sunni population, the Saddam Hussein-era military industrial complex in the area (such as the al-Quds General Company for Mechanical Industries, the al-Musayyib Ammunition Depot, and the Al Qa&#x27;qaa Munitions Facility), the lack of economic alternatives to joining the insurgency, and the near-endless supply of munitions that were stored throughout the area (in part due to the looting of the munitions facilities after the fall of Hussein&#x27;s government).

==Post-invasion violence==
After the fall of the Ba&#x27;athist government, the area&#x27;s population suffered from unemployment. One city in the north of Babil Governorate, Al Hillah, was a frequent target of insurgent attacks. On 28 February 2005, al Hillah saw the deadliest suicide bombing in the Iraq War until that point, when 125 Iraqis were killed. At 9:30 in the morning, a suicide bomber struck a crowd of recruits for police and other government jobs waiting outside for their physicals. Casualties were also suffered at a nearby vegetable market. Other suicide attacks occurred in al Hillah on 30 May 2005 (20 killed), 30 May 2006 (12 killed), and 30 August 2006 (12 killed). On 16 July 2005, the town of Musayyib was attacked in a suicide bombing in one of the most savage attacks of the war until that point, when an insurgent detonated his explosive belt in a crowded marketplace beside a fuel truck containing cooking gas, exploding the truck and killing 98 Iraqis.

The Triangle of Death often saw catastrophic attacks like these due to the proximity to both Baghdad and Fallujah-Ramadi area, where suicide bombers usually met before heading to their intended targets. The Triangle of Death also was used as the staging area for attacks in Baghdad, specifically the 24 October 2005 attack on the Palestine Hotel. The Triangle of Death saw several deadly sectarian attacks during the 2007 Ashura processions.

Even though most insurgent attacks in the Triangle of Death were against Iraqi civilians and Iraqi government forces, U.S. forces were also the target of many attacks.

On June 16, 2006, one American soldier (SPC David J. Babineau) was killed and two other soldiers (PFC Thomas L. Tucker and PV2 Kristian Menchaca) were kidnapped near the Jurf Al Sakhar Bridge (located on the Euphrates River in southwestern Yusufiyah) after their Humvee was attacked. Their remains were found four days later, on the side of a canal road near Patrol Base Swamp in Shakaria (approximately 10 kilometers northeast from where they were ambushed). The bodies were discovered by SFC Jason Beaton, of 3rd Platoon, B Company, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment (101st Airborne Division). The report from the U.S. Army Graves Registration team indicated that the bodies had been dismembered, mutilated, burned and beheaded, as well as rigged with an IED between one of the victim&#x27;s legs.

On April 8, 2007, members of Bayonet Company, 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment were on static overwatch at a battle position composed of two Bradley Fighting Vehicles southwest of Yusufiah when insurgents detonated an improvised explosive device attached to one of the vehicles. The explosion destroyed one Bradley and killed PFC David Simmons and SSG Harrison Brown.

On May 12, 2007, members of Delta Company, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment (of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 10th Mountain Division) were attacked with IED, rocket-propelled grenades and small-arms fire while operating near the Qarghouli tribe region of Yusufiyah. The ambush left five soldiers dead and three missing. The body of one of these missing soldiers, PFC Joseph Anzack, was found in the Euphrates River in Musayyib by members of D Company, 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment (Airborne) and members of the local Iraq police force. The other two missing soldiers, SGT Alex Jimenez and PFC Byron Fouty, remained missing for over a year until their remains were discovered by soldiers from 3rd platoon, A Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment &quot;Cotton Bailers By God&quot; west of the town of Jurf al-Nasr.

==Military in the area==
Numerous units were stationed in the Triangle of Death from 2003. Initial deployments began with occupation of small towns and roads, sometimes in individual houses and temporarily abandoned schools, but later expanded to extensive troop commitments and culminated in 2007 with multiple brigades incurring 15-month deployments commanded by Multi-National Division-Central headed by 3rd Infantry Division Headquarters. Attacks dropped dramatically from the spring through fall of 2007 following the activation of Multi-National Division-Central and an increase in operational tempo following the kidnapping of soldiers from 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, near Yusifiyah in May 2007. Another contributing factor to the decline in violence was the implementation of &quot;concerned citizen&quot; groups in the region, conducting their own patrols of several tribal areas.

== Situation in late 2014 to 2015 ==

The towns and villages of the Triangle of Death are under the control of the Iraqi Government following many battles to regain control over the area, of which Operation Ashura was the most significant.

<text>UFIP, an acronym for Unione Fabbricanti Italiani Piatti (&quot;Italian Cymbal Manufacturers Union&quot;) is an Italian musical instrument manufacturing company based in Pistoia, Tuscany.

The company currently produces cymbals, gongs, and metal percussion instruments.

== History ==
In the early 20th century the &quot;Agati-Tronci&quot; company, a known pipe organ manufacturer, began the production of cymbals, as they were difficult to import from Turkey. In 1926 a worker for the Tronci family, Fiorello Zanchi, left the company to start a new cymbal manufacturer with Manlio Biasei, the &quot;Zanchi &amp; Biasei&quot; company. A number of cymbals manufacturers were founded in Pistoia after the First World War, starting a competition.
On January 6, 1931 four companies (Marradi-Benti, Zanchi &amp; Biasei, Rosati Leopoldo and A. &amp; B. Fratelli Tronci) founded a cooperative society called UFIP to stop the competition between cymbals manufacturers. In 1947 Zanchi left UFIP to start his own company, Zanchi (later spelled &quot;Zanki&quot;). In 1968 UFIP changed from a cooperative society to an actual production company.

The grandson of Rosati, Buiani, co-founded with Giovanni Spadacini the Tosco company in 1974. In 1979, Robert Zildjian took over Tosco and transformed it in a Sabian subsidiary. One of the main innovation designed by Tosco is the Octagonal cymbal. This particular design inspired the Sabian Rocktagon.

At the beginning UFIP sold his cymbals under commission of various drums companies, initially with Turkish sounding names such as &quot;Zinjian&quot; (commissioned by Pearl, Ludwig and Premier), &quot;Kashian&quot; (commissioned by Slingerland), &quot;Pasha&quot; (commissioned by Rogers), &quot;Ajaha&quot; (commissioned by Gretsch) and &quot;Super Constantinoples&quot; (commissioned by Dolnet). In the United States UFIP cymbals were sold as &quot;Atlas&quot; and &quot;Abraxis&quot; until, in the early nineties, the company began to use the &quot;UFIP&quot; name internationally.

UFiP is being distributed in the United States by Davitt &amp; Hanser music.

== Manufacturing ==
UFIP is known for using the &quot;Rotocasting&quot; technique. This technique was patented (IT000001141690B) by the Zanchi brothers in the seventies. Rotocasting consists in casting molten bronze in a cymbal mold mounted on a centrifuge that spins approximately a thousand revolutions per minute. This particular technique reduces air pockets in the alloy and ensures a thicker bell-to-bow ratio. Most of the UFIP top level cymbal series are manufactured using the Rotocasting technique.

She also had a female leading role in the NBC series &quot;Route 66&quot;, a remake of the 1960s series with the same name.

Haiduk made her film debut in the 1990 horror film &quot;Luther the Geek&quot; for Troma Entertainment, and later starred in &quot;Steel and Lace&quot; (1991). She starred in the made-for-television films, notable &quot;Danielle Steel&#x27;s A Perfect Stranger&quot; (based on the novel of the same name by Danielle Steel) in 1994. In 1996, Haiduk went on to play a female vampire in the Fox supernatural horror series, &quot;&quot;. The following year, she appeared in the romantic comedy film &quot;Little City&quot; and was lead actress in the thriller film &quot;The Beneficiary&quot;. She later guest-starred on &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;NCIS&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; and &quot;&quot;. She had a recurring role as FBI Agent Elisa Thayer in &quot;Heroes&quot; from 2006 to 2007, and as Lisa Tabak in &quot;Prison Break&quot; from 2008 to 2009.

In 2006, Haiduk appeared in new supplemental material for the &quot;Superboy: The Complete First Season&quot; DVD release. She also appeared regularly on the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; as Hannah Nichols from January 2007 through January 2008. From February 2009 to August 2010, she appeared on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Patty Williams, and also played Emily Peterson on the series. In July 2010, Haiduk was cast to play a prison warden on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;; she was subsequently dismissed and recast with former &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; actress Gina Gallego after three episodes, due to a scheduling conflict with &quot;The Chicago Code&quot;. Haiduk&#x27;s appearances as Warden Smith aired in September 2010. She returned to prime time with the recurring roles on HBO series, &quot;True Blood&quot; from 2013 to 2014, and ABC Family series &quot;Twisted&quot; in 2014. In 2019, she starred in the Netflix thriller film, &quot;Home Is Where the Killer Is&quot;.

In 2018, it was announced that Haiduk had again been cast on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, this time in the roles of Kristen DiMera and lookalike Susan Banks. In early 2019, she returned to the show, signing contract this time.

==Personal life==
In June 2010, an issue of &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; reported that Haiduk has been married to Bradford Tatum since November 11, 1997. The couple met on the set of &quot;seaQuest DSV.&quot; They have one daughter, actress Sophia Tatum. In 2009, Haiduk was the subject of an online boycott petition for apparently wearing a stuffed cat as a purse during the Daytime Emmy Awards. The cat was actually a prop used in her role on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and not a purse.

<text>The Dyula (Dioula or Juula) are a Mande ethnic group inhabiting several West African countries, including Mali, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Ghana, and Burkina Faso.

Characterized as a highly successful merchant caste, &quot;Dyula&quot; migrants began establishing trading communities across the region in the fourteenth century. Since business was often conducted under non-Muslim rulers, the &quot;Dyula&quot; developed a set of theological principles for Muslim minorities in non-Muslim societies. Their unique contribution of long-distance commerce, Islamic scholarship and religious tolerance were significant factors in the peaceful expansion of Islam in West Africa.

The term &#x27;Dyula&#x27; is sometimes used interchangeably with Wangara or Jakhanke, depending on the historical period and region. 

==Historical background==
The Mandé embraced Islam during the thirteenth century following introduction to the faith through contact with the North African traders. By the 14th century, the Malian empire (c. 1230–1600) had reached its apogee, acquiring a considerable reputation for the Islamic rulings of its court and the pilgrimages of several emperors who followed the tradition of Lahilatul Kalabi, the first black prince to make &quot;hajj&quot; to Mecca. It was at this time that Mali began encouraging some of its local merchants to establish colonies close to the gold fields of West Africa. This migrant trading class were known as &quot;Dyula&quot;, the Mandingo word for “merchant”.

The &quot;Dyula&quot; spread throughout the former area of Mandé culture from the Atlantic coast of Senegambia to the Niger and from the southern edge of the Sahara to forest zones further south. They established decentralized townships in non-Muslim colonies that were linked to an extensive commercial network, in what was described by professor Philip D. Curtin as a &quot;trading diaspora&quot;. Motivated by business imperatives, they expanded into new markets, founding settlements under the auspices of various local rulers who often permitted them self-governance and autonomy. Organization of &quot;dyula&quot; trading companies was based on a clan-family structure known as the &quot;lu&quot; – a working unit consisting of a father and his sons and other attached males. Members of a given &quot;lu&quot; dispersed from the savanna to the forest, managed circulation of goods and information, placed orders, and effectively controlled the economic mechanisms of supply and demand.

===Suwarian tradition===

Over time &quot;dyula&quot; colonies developed a theological rationale for their relations with non-Muslim ruling classes and subjects in what author Nehemia Levtzion dubbed &quot;accommodationist Islam&quot;. The man credited with formulating this rationale is Sheikh Al-Hajj Salim Suwari, a Soninke cleric from the core Mali area who lived around 1500. He made &quot;hajj&quot; to Mecca several times and devoted his intellectual career to developing an understanding of the faith that would assist Muslim minorities in &quot;pagan&quot; lands. He drew on North African and Middle Eastern jurists and theologians who had reflected on the problem of Muslims living among non-Muslim majorities, situations that were frequent in the centuries of Islamic expansion.

Sheikh Suwari formulated the obligations of Muslim minorities in West Africa into something known as the &quot;Suwarian tradition&quot;. It stressed the need for Muslims to coexist peaceably with unbelievers and so justified a separation of religion and politics. In this understanding, Muslims must nurture their own learning and piety and thereby furnish good examples to the non-Muslims around them. They could accept jurisdiction of non-Muslim authorities as long as they had the necessary protection and conditions to practice the faith. In this teaching, Suwari followed a strong predilection in Islamic thought for any government, even if non-Muslim or tyrannical, as opposed to none. The military &quot;jihad&quot; was a resort only if the faithful were threatened. Suwari discouraged &quot;dawah&quot; (missionary activity), instead contending that God would bring non-Muslims to Islam in his own way; it was not a Muslim&#x27;s responsibility to decide when ignorance should give way to belief. Since their Islamic practice was capable of accommodating traditional religions, &quot;dyula&quot; often served as priests, soothsayers, and counselors at the courts of animist rulers.

==Commercial and political expansion==
As fellow Muslims, &quot;dyula&quot; merchants were also able to assess the valuable trans-Saharan trade network conducted by North African Arabs and Berbers whom they met at commercial centers across the Sahel. Some important trade goods included gold, millet, slaves, and kola nuts from the south and slave beads and cowrie shells from the north (for use as currency). It was under Mali that the great cities of the Niger bend including Gao and Djenné prospered, with Timbuktu in particular becoming known across Europe for its great wealth. Important trading centers in Southern West Africa developed at the transitional zone between the forest and the savanna; examples include Begho and Bono Manso (in present-day Ghana) and Bondoukou (in present-day Côte d&#x27;Ivoire). Western trade routes continued to be important, with Ouadane, Oualata and Chinguetti being the major trade centres in what is now Mauritania.

===Penetration into southern forest regions===
The development of &quot;Dyula&quot; trade in Ghana and the adjacent Ivory Coast had important political consequences and sometimes military implications as well. The &quot;dyula&quot; spearheaded Mande penetration of the forested zones in the south by establishing caravan routes and trading posts at strategic locations throughout the region en route to cola-producing areas. By the start of the sixteenth century, &quot;dyula&quot; merchants were trading as far south as the coast of modern Ghana.

On the forest&#x27;s northern fringes, new states emerged, such as Bono and Banda. As the economic value of gold and kola became appreciated, forests south of these states which had hitherto been little inhabited because of limited agricultural potential became more thickly populated, and the same principles of political and military mobilization began being applied there. Village communities became tributaries of ruling groups, with some members becoming the clients and slaves needed to support royal households, armies, and trading enterprises. Sometimes these political changes were not to the advantage of the &quot;Dyula&quot;, who employed Mande warriors to guard their caravans and if necessary could call in larger contingents from the Sudanic kingdoms. In the seventeenth century, tensions between the Muslims and the local pagans in Begho erupted into a destructive war which eventually led to the total abandonment of the Banda capital. The local people eventually settled in a number of towns further east, while the dyula withdrew to the west to the further side of the Banda hills where they established the new trading center of Bonduku.

===Gonja state===
The &quot;dyula&quot; presence and changes in the balance of power occasioned political upheavals in other places. Among the paramount Mande political initiatives along trade routes south of Jenne was creation of the &quot;dyula&quot; state of Gonja by Naba&#x27;a in the 16th century. This was motivated by a general worsening of the competitive position of dyula traders and was occasioned by three factors: (1) a near-monopoly control in exporting forest produce achieved by the Akan kingdom of Bono; (2) the rise to power further north of the Dagomba Kingdom which controlled local salt pans; and (3) increased competition following the arrival in the region of rival long-distance traders from Hausaland.

The reaction of the Dyula in the Bono-Banda-Gonja region to these developments was to establish a kingdom of their own in Gonja – the territory northern traders had to cross to reach Akan forestlands, situated in what is now modern Ghana. By 1675, Gonja had established a paramount chief called Yagbongwura to control the kingdom. But Gonja was not a fruitful land in which to try to maintain a centralized government. This is because the Dagomba power to the north and Akan power to the south were too powerful; thus, the new kingdom rapidly declined in strength.

===Kong Empire===
Many of the trading posts established by the &quot;Dyula&quot; eventually became market villages or cities, such as Kong in today&#x27;s Northeastern Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. It emerged as a commercial center when Malian merchants began trading in the territory which was inhabited by pagan Senufo and other Voltaic groups. The sous-préfecture of Kong, in the area of Kong to Dabakala, is said to be the “origin” area, where &quot;dyula&quot; traders first settled in the twelfth century. &quot;Dyula&quot; presence in the Kong area grew rapidly in the seventeenth century as a result of the developing trade between the commercial centers along the Niger banks and the forest region to the south which was controlled by the Baule chiefdoms and the Ashanti. The &quot;dyula&quot; brought their trading skills and connections and transformed Kong into an international market for the exchange of northern desert goods, such as salt and cloth, and southern forest exports, such as cola nuts, gold, and slaves. The city was also a religious center that housed a substantial academic community of Muslim scholars, with palaces and mosques built in the traditional Sudanese style. As Kong grew prosperous, its early rulers from the Taraweré clan combined &quot;dyula&quot; and Senufo traditions and extended their authority over the surrounding region.

By the eighteenth century the &quot;dyula&quot; had become quite powerful in the area and wished to rid themselves of subordination to Senufo chiefs. This was achieved in an uprising led by Seku Wattara (Ouattara), a &quot;dyula&quot; warrior who claimed descent from the Malinke Keita lineage and who had studied the Quran and engaged in commerce before becoming a warrior. By rallying around himself all &quot;dyula&quot; in the area, Seku Wattara easily defeated local chiefdoms and set up an independent &quot;Dyula&quot; state in 1710, the first of its kind in West Africa. He established himself as ruler and under his authority, the city rose from a small city-state to the capital of the great Kong Empire, holding sway over much of the region. The &quot;dyula&quot; of Kong also maintained commercial links with European traders on the Atlantic coast around the Gulf of Guinea, from whom they easily obtained prized European goods, most notably rifles, gunpowder, and textiles. The acquisition of weapons allowed for the creation of an armed militia force that protected trade routes passing through the territories of various minor rulers. In the course of developing his state, Seku Wattara built a strong army composed mostly of defeated pagan groups. The leadership of the army eventually developed into a new warrior class, called &quot;sonangi&quot;, which was gradually separated from the overall &quot;dyula&quot; merchant class.

The Kong Empire started to decline after the death of Seku Wattara. Succession struggles divided the kingdom into two parts, with the northern area being controlled by Seku&#x27;s brother Famagan who refused to recognize the rule of Seku&#x27;s oldest son in the south. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, many of Kong&#x27;s provinces had formed independent chiefdoms. The city of Kong retained the prestige of an Islamic commercial center, but it was no longer the seat of an important political power. It eventually came under French colonial control in 1898. Despite the fall from glory, the seventeenth-century Kong Friday Mosque survived, and the city was largely rebuilt in a traditional Sudano-Sahelian architectural style and features a Qur&#x27;anic school.

===Kingdom of Wasulu===

The Mande conquerors of the nineteenth century frequently utilized trade routes established by the &quot;Dyula&quot;. Indeed, it was his exploitation of their commercial network that allowed military leader Samory Touré (1830–1900) to rise to a dominant position in the Upper Niger region. A member of a &quot;dyula&quot; family from Sanankoro in Guinea, Samori conquered and united &quot;Dyula&quot; states during the 1860s. He gained control over the Milo River Valley in 1871, seized the village of Kankan in 1881, and became the principal power holder on the Upper Niger. By 1883, Samori had successfully brought the local chieftains under his control and officially founded the kingdom of Wasulu.

Having established an empire, he adopted the religious title of &quot;Almami&quot; in 1884 and recreated the Malian realm. This new state was governed by Samori and a council of kinsmen and clients who took on the management of the chancery and the treasury, and administered justice, religious affairs, and foreign relations. Unlike some of his contemporary state-builders, Samori was not a religious preacher, and Wasulu was not a reformist state as such. Nevertheless, he used Islam to unify the nation, promoting Islamic education and basing his rule on &quot;shari’a&quot; (Islamic law). However, Samori&#x27;s professional army was the essential institution and the real strength behind his empire. He imported horses and weapons and modernized the army along European lines.

&quot;Dyula&quot; traders had never enjoyed as much prosperity as they did under the &quot;almamy&quot;. Even though they did not play a central part in the creation of the state, the &quot;dyula&quot; supported Samori because he actively encouraged commerce and protected trade routes, thus promoting a free circulation of people and goods. Samori put up the strongest resistance to European colonial penetration in West Africa, fighting both the French and British for seventeen years. Samori&#x27;s would-be Muslim empire was undone by the French, who took Sikasso in 1898, and sent Samori into exile, where he died in 1900.

==Dyula culture and society==
&quot;Dyula&quot; society is hierarchical or caste-based, with nobility and vassals. Like numerous other African peoples, they previously held slaves (&quot;jonw&quot;), who were often war prisoners from lands surrounding their territory. Descendants of former kings and generals had a higher status than their nomadic and more settled compatriots. With time, that difference has eroded, corresponding to the economic fortunes of the groups.

The traditional &quot;dyula&quot; social structure is further organized into various familial clan groups, and clan affiliation continues to be a dominant aspect of both collective and individual identity. People are fiercely loyal to their clan lineage, often expressing their cultural history and devotion through the oral traditions of dance and storytelling. The &quot;dyula&quot; are patrilineal and patriarchal, with older males possessing the most power and influence. Men and women commonly reside in separate houses made of mud or cement - men occupying roundhouses and women in rectangular ones. The father heads the family, and inheritances are passed down from fathers to their sons. Despite being illegal, the &quot;dyula&quot; still practice polygamy, and young people are often encouraged to marry within their own clan.

Another hereditary class that was afforded a particularly important status by the &quot;dyula&quot; social hierarchy was occupied by the &quot;tuntigi&quot; or warrior class. The &quot;dyula&quot; had long been accustomed to surrounding their cities with fortifications and taking up arms when it was deemed necessary in order to defend themselves and maintain the smooth flow of trade caravans. As a result, they became closely associated with the &quot;tuntigi&quot; warriors.
==Islamic tradition==
The &quot;dyula&quot; have been predominantly Muslim since the 13th century. Many in rural areas combine Islamic beliefs with certain pre-Islamic animistic traditions such as the presence of spirits and use of amulets. &quot;Dyula&quot; communities have a reputation for historically maintaining a high standard of Muslim education. The &quot;dyula&quot; family enterprise based on the &quot;lu&quot; could afford to provide some of its younger men an Islamic education. Thus, an &quot;ulema&quot; (clerical) class known as karamogo emerged, who were educated in the Quran and commentary (&quot;tafsir&quot;), &quot;hadith&quot; (prophetic narrations), and the life of Muhammad. According to the &quot;dyula&quot; clerical tradition, a student received instruction under a single &quot;sheikh&quot; for a duration varying from five to thirty years, and earned his living as a part-time farmer working his teacher&#x27;s lands. After he completed his studies, a &quot;karamogo&quot; obtained a turban and an &quot;isnad&quot; (teaching license), and either sought further instruction or started his own school in a remote village. A highly educated &quot;karamogo&quot; could become a professional &quot;imam&quot; or &quot;qadi&quot; (judge).

Certain families gained a reputation for providing multiple generations of scholars. For example, the Saghanughu clan was a &quot;dyula&quot; lineage living in Northern and Western Ivory Coast and parts of the Upper Volta. This lineage may be traced to Timbuktu, but its principal figure was Sheikh Muhammad al-Mustafa Saghanughu (died 1776), the &quot;imam&quot; of Bobo-Dyulasso. He produced an educational system based on three canonical texts of Quranic commentary (&quot;tafsir&quot;) and &quot;hadith&quot;. His sons continued spreading their father&#x27;s teachings and expanded through towns in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, founding Islamic schools, or madaris, and acting as &quot;imams&quot; and &quot;qadis&quot;.

These &quot;madaris&quot; were probably a positive byproduct of the long history of Muslims&#x27; interest in literary work. In &quot;The Islamic Literary Tradition in Ghana&quot;, author Thomas Hodgkin enumerates the large literary contribution that was made by Dyula-Wangara Muslims to the history of not only the regions they found themselves in but also of West Africa as a whole. He cites al-Hajj Osmanu Eshaka Boyo of Kintampo as an &quot;&quot;‘alim&quot; with a wide range of Muslim connexions and an excellent grasp of local Islamic history&quot; whose efforts brought together a great many Arabic manuscripts from around Ghana. These manuscripts, the &quot;Isnad al-shuyukh wa’l-ulama&quot;, or &quot;Kitab Ghunja&quot;, compiled by al-Hajj ‘Umar ibn Abi Bakr ibn ‘Uthman al-Kabbawi al-Kanawi al-Salaghawi of Kete-Krachi whom Hodgkin describes as &quot;the most interesting, and historically significant of the poets&quot;, may now be found in the library of the Institute of African Studies of the University of Ghana.

==Dioula language==
The &quot;dyula&quot; speak the Dioula language or &quot;Julakan&quot;, which is included in the group of closely interrelated Manding languages that are spoken by various ethnic groups spread across Western Africa. Dioula is most closely related to the Bambara language (the most widely spoken language in Mali), in a manner similar to the relation between American English and British English. It is probably the most used language for trade in West Africa.

The Dioula language and people are distinct from the Diola (Jola) people of Guinea-Bissau and Casamance.

<text>Graphical Models is an academic journal in computer graphics and geometry processing publisher by Elsevier. , its editor-in-chief is Bedrich Benes of the Purdue University.

==History==
This journal has gone through multiple names. Founded in 1972 as Computer Graphics and Image Processing by Azriel Rosenfeld, it became the first journal to focus on computer image analysis.
Its first change of name came in 1983, when it became Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image Processing. In 1991, it split into two journals, CVGIP: Graphical Models and Image Processing,
and &quot;CVGIP: Image Understanding&quot;, which later became &quot;Computer Vision and Image Understanding&quot;. Meanwhile, in 1995, the journal Graphical Models and Image Processing removed the &quot;CVGIP&quot; prefix from its former name, and finally took its current title, &quot;Graphical Models&quot;, in 2002.

==Ranking==
Although initially ranked by SCImago Journal Rank as a top-quartile journal in 1999 in its main topic areas, computer graphics and computer-aided design, and then for many years ranked as second-quartile, by 2020 it had fallen to the third quartile.

<text>The Mütter Museum is a medical history and science museum located in the Center City area of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It contains a collection of anatomical and pathological specimens, wax models, and antique medical equipment. The museum is part of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia. The original purpose of the museum, founded with a gift from Dr. Thomas Dent Mütter on December 11, 1858, was for the education of medical professionals, medical students, and invited guests of College Fellows, and did not become open to non-Fellows until the mid-1970s. The College of Physicians of Philadelphia is itself not a teaching organization, but rather a member organization or &quot;scientific body dedicated to the advancement of science and medicine&quot;.

The museum has a collection of over 37,000 specimens, of which about 10% were on display as of 2023. This does not include the large literary collection contained within the Historical Medical Library, which is also housed within the College of Physicians of Philadelphia.

Collection items, artifacts, and specimens were acquired globally, and as Ella Wade (curator from 1939 to 1957) says, &quot;The Mütter Museum Committee, as the minutes show, proceeded to spend Dr. Mütter&#x27;s money like sailors on shore leave&quot;. In other words, some museum material was purchased by College Fellows as they travelled the world, and they were reimbursed for each purchase and any expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions. Other collection items were donated from the private collections of physicians.

In October 2023, the Mütter Museum was awarded a grant from the Pew Center for Arts and Heritage to research the history of the collection of human remains to better understand how each body and specimen came into the museum collections and to conduct discussions with members of the public to discuss the future of the museum. The first Town Hall discussion took place on November 17, 2023.

== Osteological (skeletal) specimens ==
The Mütter Museum is home to over 3,000 osteological specimens, including several full skeletons. One of the most famous of these is the fully articulated skeleton of Harry Raymond Eastlack, who suffered from FOP.

Other osteological specimens include:
* The Mütter American Giant, the tallest human skeleton on exhibit in North America, at 7’6&quot; (228.6 cm) tall.
* The Hyrtl Skull Collection, a collection of 139 skulls from Josef Hyrtl, an Austrian anatomist. This collection&#x27;s original purpose was to show the diversity of cranial anatomy in Europeans, thereby disproving the racial science of phrenology.
* The skeleton of Mary Ashberry, a woman with achondroplasia who died in 1856 due to medical negligence during childbirth.
* 10 skulls and 5 crania with extensive syphilitic involvement, many of which are specimens from the original Mütter donation.

== Wet specimens ==
The Mütter Collection comprises almost 1,500 wet specimens acquired between the 19th and 21st centuries. These include teratological specimens, cysts, tumors and other pathologies from nearly every organ of the body.

These include:

* The heart of Robert Pendarvis, a living donor with acromegaly
* Intestinal specimens collected during the 1849 cholera outbreak by Dr. John Neill, curator of what was then known as the Pathological Cabinet of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia 
* 19th and early 20th century tattooed skin 

== Wax models ==
Augmenting the real human specimens on display are numerous wax models displaying various examples of pathology in the human body. These models, mostly produced by Tramond of Paris and Joseph Towne of London, were used for educational purposes when cadavers were difficult to acquire and preserve. Some moulages are known to have used skeletal remains as a part of their construction. One of the most famous wax models on display in the Mütter Museum is the last known remaining model of Madame Dimanche, who had a, &quot;human horn (cutaneous horn). Successfully removed after six-years growth from Madame Dimanche, a Parisian widow, in the early 19th century. From the original collection of Dr. Thomas Dent Mütter (1811-1859)&quot;.

== Other specimens ==
The museum&#x27;s holdings also include:
* A malignant tumor removed from President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s hard palate
* The conjoined liver and plaster torso death cast of Thai-American Siamese twins Chang and Eng Bunker
* A piece of thoracic tissue removed from John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln
* A section of the brain of Charles J. Guiteau, the assassin of President James A. Garfield
* The Chevalier Jackson Foreign Body Collection, a collection of 2,374 swallowed or inhaled objects that Dr. Jackson extracted from patients’ throats, esophaguses, and lungs during his almost 75-year-long career. Most of the items are on display.

== Exhibitions ==
=== &quot;Dr. Benjamin Rush Medicinal Plant Garden&quot; ===
Dr. Rush helped to found the College of Physicians of Philadelphia in 1787, which is now home to the Mütter Museum. Dr. Rush pushed for the maintenance of a medicinal garden to allow College Fellows to replenish items in their medicinal chests. The Garden was eventually founded in 1937. It displays between 50 and 60 medicinal herbs and plants, which include strawberries, wormwort, and bugleweed.

=== Special exhibitions ===
The museum is also host to a variety of changing special exhibits.

== Curators==
=== Dr. Joseph McFarland ===
Dr. Joseph McFarland was the curator of the Mütter Museum from 1937 to 1945. He published multiple papers looking into some of the more questionable histories of museum collections, including The Soap Lady, and the Mütter American Giant. McFarland was able to prove, through dogged historical and archival research, that Leidy&#x27;s stories for both &quot;The Petrified Woman&quot; at the Mütter Museum, and &quot;The Petrified Man&quot; at the Wistar Institute were complete nonsense. McFarland read through the annals of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia nearly 70 years after The Mütter American Giant first graced its halls and ascertained that there truly was nothing known about the former owner.

=== Ella N. Wade ===
Ella Wade (1892-1980), began her tenure at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia as a clerk. She became the first female curator and the first curator without an MD.

=== Gretchen Worden ===
Gretchen Worden joined the museum staff as a curatorial assistant in 1975 and became the museum&#x27;s curator in 1982 and its director in 1988.

Worden was a frequent guest on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;displaying a mischievous glee as she frightened him with human hairballs and wicked-looking Victorian surgical tools, only to disarm him with her antic laugh&quot; and appeared in numerous PBS, BBC and cable television documentaries (including an episode of Errol Morris&#x27; show &quot;First Person&quot;) as well as NPR&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air with Terry Gross&quot; on the museum&#x27;s behalf. She was also instrumental in the creation of numerous Mütter Museum projects, including the popular Mütter Museum calendars and the book, &quot;The Mütter Museum: Of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia&quot;. During Worden&#x27;s tenure, the visitorship of the museum grew from several hundred visitors each year to, at the time of her death, more than 60,000 tourists annually.

After her death, the Mütter Museum opened a gallery in her memory. In an article written about the gallery&#x27;s September 30, 2005 opening, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described the &quot;Gretchen Worden Room&quot;:

Worden was known for using humor and shock factor to garner interest in the museum. In the foreword of &quot;The Mütter Museum: Of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia&quot;, she wrote &quot;While these bodies may be ugly, there is a terrifying beauty in the spirits of those forced to endure these afflictions.&quot;

== Podcast ==
In September 2020, the Mütter Museum launched a medical history podcast, entitled My Favorite Malady.

Blast Books has published two large books of photography involving the Mütter Museum.

The first book, 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Mütter Museum: Of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia&quot;, contains images of the museum&#x27;s exhibits shot by contemporary fine art photographers. William Wegman, Joel-Peter Witkin and Shelby Lee Adams have work that appear in the book.

The second book was 2007&#x27;s &quot;Mütter Museum Historic Medical Photographs&quot;.

&quot;Mütter&quot;, a screenplay based on the life of Mütter Museum founder Thomas Dent Mütter, won the 2003 &quot;Set In Philadelphia&quot; Screenwriting Award at the Philadelphia Film Festival and a Sloan Foundation Fellowship at the 2004 Hampton International Film Festival. The screenplay, written by poet and Philadelphia native Cristin O&#x27;Keefe Aptowicz, remains unproduced, although a short based on the feature-length script was created as a part of the Philadelphia Film Festival prize package.

In 2010, Aptowicz was named the 2010–2011 University of Pennsylvania ArtsEdge Writer-in-Residence and she noted that she will be using the residency to work on a biography of Thomas Dent Mütter. The museum has granted Aptowicz full access to their museum, library and archives for the duration of the residency so that she may conduct her research for the book, and the Mütter Museum&#x27;s Francis C. Wood Institute for the History of Medicine has additionally awarded Aptowicz with a Wood Institute Travel Grant to help further fund and support her work on this project. In April 2013, it was announced that Aptowicz&#x27;s biography of Mütter will be published in Fall 2014 by the Gotham Books division of Penguin. On September 4, 2014, &quot;Dr. Mütter&#x27;s Marvels: A True Tale of Intrigue and Innovation at the Dawn of Modern Medicine&quot; was released to critical acclaim, including starred reviews in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;Library Journal&quot;, &quot;School Library Journal&quot; and Kirkus Reviews, as well as lengthy positive reviews in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, The Onion&#x27;s AV Club and NPR. The book would debut at #7 on The New York Times Bestseller List for Books about Health.

In 2016, Harvard University Press published &quot;Bone Rooms: From Scientific Racism to Human Prehistory in Museums&quot;. The author, Samuel J. Redman, completed a pair of residencies through the Francis C. Wood Institute for the History of Medicine program in 2010 and 2015. A chapter in the book examines the history of collecting at the Mütter Museum.

<text>A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is a Bayesian network (BN) which relates variables to each other over adjacent time steps. 

== History ==
A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is often called a &quot;two-timeslice&quot; BN (2TBN) because it says that at any point in time T, the value of a variable can be calculated from the internal regressors and the immediate prior value (time T-1). DBNs were developed by Paul Dagum in the early 1990s at Stanford University&#x27;s Section on Medical Informatics. Dagum developed DBNs to unify and extend traditional linear state-space models such as Kalman filters, linear and normal forecasting models such as ARMA and simple dependency models such as hidden Markov models into a general probabilistic representation and inference mechanism for arbitrary nonlinear and non-normal time-dependent domains.

Today, DBNs are common in robotics, and have shown potential for a wide range of data mining applications. For example, they have been used in speech recognition, digital forensics, protein sequencing, and bioinformatics. DBN is a generalization of hidden Markov models and Kalman filters.

DBNs are conceptually related to probabilistic Boolean networks and can, similarly, be used to model dynamical systems at steady-state.

<text>USS &quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot; was a schooner-rigged screw steamer.

== Service history ==
===CSS &quot;Florida&quot;===
&quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot; was built in &quot;Florida&quot; in 1859 at Greenpoint, New York. She was taken into the Confederate States Navy in 1862 as CSS &quot;Florida&quot;. 

=== USS &quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot; ===

&quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot; was captured by the while attempting to run the blockade at St. Andrews Bay, Florida on 6 April 1862. She was taken to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for adjudication, where she was condemned and purchased by the United States Department of the Navy from the prize court on 20 September 1862. Renamed &quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot;, she was commissioned on 30 December 1862 at Philadelphia, Acting Master John E. Giddings commanding. Assigned to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron, &quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot; sailed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, arriving on 3 January 1863, and from there proceeded to her blockading station off East Pass, St. George&#x27;s Sound, Florida. On station 1 February, &quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot; began her long months of arduous blockade duty, working to shut off commerce through the multitude of small inlets and passes of the Florida coast.

She remained off St. George&#x27;s Sound until late August 1863, capturing schooner &quot;Margaret&quot; on 1 February and schooner &quot;Teresa&quot; on 16 April. She then retired to Boston, Massachusetts for repairs and refitting, returning to a new station off the mouth of the Suwannee River on 28 December. Resuming her blockading duties, &quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot; encountered a small schooner off Key West, Florida on 21 March 1864 and stood toward her. The blockade runner, &quot;Wild Pigeon&quot;, suddenly turned across &quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot;&#x27;s bow, however, and was inadvertently rammed and sunk. None of her assorted cargo could be recovered. The steamer continued her blockading duties through 1864, spending much of her time in busy Tampa Bay and St. Marks, Florida. A group of her men went ashore on an expedition on 12 November and engaged some Confederate soldiers briefly, in one of the many forays ashore by personnel of the East Gulf Squadron.

&quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot; participated from 27 February to 7 March 1865 in an expedition with Union Army units in the vicinity of St. Marks, Florida. The steamer helped blockade the river and some of her crew went ashore with the Army in an attempt to capture Confederate positions in what came to be known as the Battle of Natural Bridge. Two of the ship&#x27;s sailors were awarded the Medal of Honor for their part in this battle: Seaman John Mack and Coxswain George Schutt. Following the end of the U.S. Civil War, &quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot; was not retained in the squadron, and was ordered north on 15 July 1865. She decommissioned on 8 August 1865 at Philadelphia and was sold on 12 September. &quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot; operated in commercial service until she was wrecked off Havana, Cuba on 13 November 1867. Her passengers and crew were rescued.

<doc id="1242717" wikidata="Q268969" url="?curid=1242717" title="Pitheciinae">
<text>Pitheciinae is a subfamily of the New World monkey family Pitheciidae. It contains three genera and 14 species. Pitheciines are forest dwellers from northern and central South America, east of the Andes.

They are small to medium-sized primates, with a stocky build due to their close skin. The skin is covered in shaggy fur, its coloring varies depending upon species from black to grey and brown up to white. Parts of the face can be bald. The tail, which is not used for grasping but for balance, is also hairy, although the uakari&#x27;s tail is only a stub.

Like most New World monkeys, they are diurnal and arboreal. They are good climbers and spend the majority of their life in the trees. They live in groups ranging in number from small groups (such as with the saki monkeys ) to as many as 50 animals. They communicate with a set of sounds which typically includes high cries and a nearly bird-like twitter.

Pitheciines are generally omnivores, the main part of their diet coming from fruits and insects. This is supplemented by flowers, buds, nuts and small vertebrates. Large canines help them to break through the hard rind of the unripe fruits.

Births are typically of single offspring with a gestation time of about 5 to 6 months. They typically reach maturity at approximately 3 to 4 years and can become up to 15 years old.

<text>The Record of the Year was an award voted by the United Kingdom public. For many years it was given in conjunction with a television programme on ITV of the same name.

The award began in 1998 and was televised on ITV for eight years before being dropped in 2006 after disagreements over the phone voting element. Since then, it had been an online poll, administered through the Record of the Year website. In 2013, the online poll was axed, signaling the end of the award. It became one of the highest rated music TV ceremonies in the UK, boosting sales of CDs and then downloads in the crucial fortnight before Christmas every year. For that reason, it was much respected by the industry, labels, publishers and retailers. It was the only music award in the UK to be chosen by the public.

==Format==
At the beginning of December, a shortlist of twenty (later extended to thirty) songs were decided by an expert industry panel and showcased in a preview programme, with the public then invited to choose their favourite by phone vote, and the ten songs with the most votes advanced to the live show the following week.

The live show, held on a Saturday just before Christmas, was split into two parts. In the first part, the ten songs were represented as either live performances or pre-recorded performances via satellite if the artist was unable to travel to the UK and on some occasions, if a performance of any kind was not possible, the song was represented by an airing of its music video. After all of the songs had been presented, the phone lines were opened and in later years, voting was also conducted by both online and text message. In the second part, aired around one or two hours later, the results of the vote were announced with each ITV region represented by its own spokesperson to announce the results of their local area. The artist with the most votes was declared the winner and received the trophy before performing their winning song again to close the programme.

==Winners==
The most frequent winner was Irish boy band Westlife, with four awards (1999, 2000, 2003 and 2005), two of which were consecutive. The only other artist to win multiple awards was American singer Lady Gaga, with two awards (2009 and 2011).

The 2008 winner, &quot;Rockstar&quot; by Canadian band Nickelback, was the first winner from North America.

The only artist to receive multiple nominations in the same year was American rapper Pitbull, who was nominated as both a lead and featured artist in 2011, although he never won.

==Results by year==
===1998===
The first Record of the Year took place on 12 December 1998 and presented by Denise van Outen. The ten finalists were:

===1999===
The second Record of the Year took place on 11 December 1999 and presented by Denise van Outen. The ten finalists were:

===2000===
The third Record of the Year took place on 9 December 2000 and presented by Denise van Outen. In a change to the first two years, the votes that each song received from each region were converted into a points value (e.g. the least voted song received 1 point, and the highest voted song received 10 points). The ten finalists were:

===2001===
The fourth Record of the Year took place on 8 December 2001. Ant &amp; Dec presented the show for the first time. For the first time, in addition to the regional phone vote, viewers could cast their vote online, the result of which was announced as an individual set of points. The ten finalists were:

===2002===
The fifth Record of the Year took place on 7 December 2002 and presented by Ant &amp; Dec. The results format was changed from this year onwards, the five songs with the lowest votes were eliminated from the scoreboard and only the top five songs went forward to receive points from the regional vote. Text message voting was also introduced this year; like the online vote the previous year, these results had their own individual set of points awarded. The ten finalists were:

===2003===
The sixth Record of the Year took place on 6 December 2003. Ant &amp; Dec were unable to return as hosts due to their commitments presenting &quot;Pop Idol&quot;; and the pair were replaced as hosts by Cat Deeley. The ten finalists were:

==Criticism and praise==
Many have criticised the &#x27;Record of the Year&#x27; Award, as they feel the nominations are unfairly dominated by pop acts and thus the winner is usually not the &quot;true&quot; record of the year. One suggested reason for this is that it is done to attract young girls, who the organisers are sure will watch the televised final and vote for the records. Others have argued that it is an attempt to boost the sales of pop artists&#x27; albums, which traditionally have limited success relative to their singles, in the crucial pre-Christmas period. Of the examples cited as evidence for this, the most famous include the exclusion of rap artist Eminem&#x27;s &quot;My Name Is...&quot; in 1999 as he was unavailable to perform live on the Record of the Year final and the omission from nominations of rock act The Darkness&#x27;s track &quot;I Believe in a Thing Called Love&quot; in 2003 despite being one of the highest selling singles of the year.

In spite of this, many winners of the award, as well as the organisers, argue its significance and integrity on the basis that it represents the views of the public, rather than critics. It inspired Simon Cowell to get into television and he attributes the show for his entry into the media. The writer and director Richard Curtis, who is the founder of Comic Relief, also cited Gareth Gates&#x27; win of the 2002 award as the deciding factor in asking him to record the following year&#x27;s Red Nose Day single for the charity. Some may argue this is not entirely a good thing. However, it always gets massive ratings. Indeed, Westlife have often said that their first win for the single &quot;Flying Without Wings&quot; was the most exciting moment in their career. Unsurprisingly, critics eventually began to say that it was just an award to prove Westlife were still around, hence why Heat Magazine dubbed it &quot;Westlife Record of the Year&quot; in 2004. However, a counter-argument is that this, and similar awards based on phone polls, are a true representation of public opinion, a possibly better indication than sales, which calls BBC Radio 1&#x27;s countdown of the 20 best selling singles of the last calendar year a more accurate indication of the record of the year. Still, the chosen tracks on the televised Record of the Year contest reflect the views of the television programme viewers only, and not necessarily the music-buying public at large, who might not phone in multiple times to vote for their favourite song. In contrast, the Radio 1 end-of-year chart includes all music sales in all formats.

==Sponsorship==
Below is a list of companies that have sponsored the award since it began:

* 1998–2001: Britannia Music
* 2002–2005: T-Mobile

==Theme music==
From 1998 to 2004, the theme music was the club track &quot;Disco Cop&quot; by Blue Adonis. In 2005, ITV used a specially recorded track.

<text>The Bolson tortoise (Gopherus flavomarginatus), also called the Mexican giant tortoise, Mexican gopher tortoise, yellow-bordered tortoise or yellow-margined tortoise, is a species of tortoise from North America. Of the six North American tortoise species, it is the largest, having a carapace length of about . It lives in a region of the Chihuahuan Desert known as the Bolsón de Mapimí, which is located in north-central Mexico.

==Discovery==

The Bolson tortoise was discovered only in 1959. The legend is that a group of biologists working in the Bolsón de Mapimí were at a ranch and saw chickens eating out of a large tortoise shell. They inquired about the origin of the shell and the locals responded by saying that it was, &quot;la tortuga grande del desierto&quot;, the big turtle of the desert.

In 1979 the 340,000 hectare Mapimi Biosphere Reserve was created to protect the Bolson tortoise and other unique flora and fauna of the Bolsón de Mapimí. Despite this designation, cattle ranching and mining still occur in the reserve. Whether this is detrimental to the tortoise is not known.

==Declining population==
The most recent research, published in 1991 from data collected in 1983, estimates that fewer than 10,000 tortoises remain in the wild. Populations have declined mostly due to overcollecting for food and the pet trade. Incursion of roads, railroads and agricultural development have accelerated the decline of the species in the last 40 years. In the central portion of its range locals are keenly aware of the tortoise&#x27;s protected status and aid in its conservation. However, in the northeastern portion of its range, near La Sierra Mojada, populations of the tortoise are low. It is believed that tortoises are still collected and eaten in this area. Additionally, extensive brush clearing operations are being conducted to make way for cattle grazing. In 2008, following the construction of federally subsidized ethanol plants, extensive corn farming operations began within the Mapimi Biosphere Reserve. Farms have been tilled in tortoise habitat, despite its protected status. In 2018, the IUCN Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group recommended a re-assessment and re-classification of all six &quot;Gopherus&quot; species. This reclassification would move &quot;G. flavomarginatus&quot; from Vulnerable (VU) to Critically Endangered (CR)

==Appleton tortoises==
In the fall of 2006, 26 Bolson tortoises were translocated from the Audubon Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch in Elgin, Arizona to Ted Turner&#x27;s Armendaris Ranch in south-central New Mexico, a Chihuahuan desert environment within the prehistoric range of this species. These tortoises, known as the Appleton tortoises in commemoration of Ariel Appleton, a champion of Bolson tortoise conservation, were originally brought to Arizona from Durango, Mexico by Dr. David Morafka in 1973. Four tortoises from the Appleton population were established at the Living Desert Museum in Carlsbad, New Mexico. Both locations have active breeding programs in place.

==Rewilding==
The Bolson tortoise was recently brought to the world&#x27;s attention when, in August 2005 an, article on Pleistocene rewilding appeared in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; (Donlan, et al., 2005) proposing that megafauna that became extinct in North America at the close of the Pleistocene (~12,800 years ago) be reintroduced to the continent to create a Pleistocene Park. The Bolson tortoise was the first species proposed for this restoration effort. The tortoise is unique in that, unlike mammoths, sabre-toothed cats and giant ground sloths, it is not extinct. The Turner Endangered Species Fund, who re-introduced the tortoise to New Mexico, has made it clear that the restoration of the tortoise to the Southwest is an endangered species recovery project and not a rewilding project, although elements of rewilding exist.

<text>Negril is a small, widely dispersed beach resort and town located in Westmoreland and Hanover parishes at the far western part of Jamaica, southwest from Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay. 

Westmoreland is the westernmost parish in Jamaica, located on the south side of the island. Downtown Negril, the West End cliff resorts to the south of downtown, and the southern portion of the so-called seven mile (11 km) beach are in Westmoreland Parish. The northernmost resorts are along the Negril Beach and are nearer if not across the border where Westmoreland Parish meets the Hanover Parish. The nearest large town is Savanna-la-Mar, the capital of Westmoreland Parish if traveling South West. Whereas going in the opposite direction along the A1 highway is Lucea, the Capital Town of Hanover.

==History==

===Spanish colonialism===
The name &quot;Negril&quot; is a shortened version of &quot;Negrillo&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Little black one&quot;), as it was originally named by the Spaniards in 1494. A theory holds that because there was a vast population of black eels along Negril&#x27;s coast, the Spaniards called the area &quot;Anguila Negra&quot;, which was shortened to &quot;Negrillo&quot; and then to &quot;Negril&quot;.

===20th century===
Negril&#x27;s development as a resort location began during the late 1950s, though access to the area proved difficult as ferries were required to drop off passengers in Negril Bay, forcing them to wade to shore. Most vacationers would rent rooms inside the homes of Jamaican families, or would pitch tents in their yards. Daniel Connell was the first person to create more conventional vacation lodging for these &quot;flower children&quot; when he set up the first guest house in Negril - Palm Grove. The area&#x27;s welcoming and hospitable reputation grew over time and the first of many resorts was constructed in the mid to late 1960s. The first hotel in Negril was the Yacht Club by Mary&#x27;s Bay on the West End.

When the road between Montego Bay and Negril was improved in the early 1970s, it helped to increase Negril&#x27;s status as a new resort location. It was a two-lane paved road that ran approximately inland from two white coral sand beaches, at the southern end of which was a small village. The long paved road from the village ran north to Green Island, home to many of the Jamaican workers in Negril, and was straight enough to double as a runway for small airplanes. Lengths of railroad track stand on end along the side of the road to discourage drug smugglers from landing on the road to pick up cheap cargos of marijuana.

After Negril&#x27;s infrastructure was expanded—anticipating the growth of resorts and an expanding population, a small airport, the Negril Aerodrome, was built in 1976 near Rutland Point, alongside several small hotels mostly catering to the North American winter tourists. Europeans also came to Negril, and several hotels were built to cater directly to those guests.

For years, Negril&#x27;s beach was rated as one of the top ten beaches in the world by several travel magazines. The beach&#x27;s length is significant — the two bays (Bloody Bay to the north, and Long Bay to the south) comprise the Seven Mile Beach. The beach is actually roughly 7 miles in length, with Bloody Bay being around 2 miles, and Long Bay being just under 5 miles. Bloody Bay is home to the large, all-inclusive resorts, and Long Bay has all-inclusives and smaller, family-run hotels.

South of downtown Negril is West End Road, known as the West End, which is lined with resorts that offer more privacy. These areas have access to waters used for snorkelling and diving, with jumping points reaching more than high.

Many vendors and shops are located around the beach resorts; however, they are predominantly located on the south end of the beach, where there are fewer all-inclusive resorts.

A new highway from Montego Bay and an improved infrastructure may bring more tourists. As a result, more hotels and tour operators continue to develop new attractions and excursions in Negril. Since the 1980s, it has also become a popular location for U.S. college students to visit during spring break, or just a regular vacation in Jamaica.

The last few years have seen major development along the beach. The resorts include Couples Swept Away, Couples Negril, Sandals, Beaches, Samsara Hotel, Legends Resort, the Grand Lido, Riu Palace Tropical Bay, Riu Club Hotel, and Hedonism II. The Hedonism II resort is one enduring hotel and resort that remains an adult destination. 

A franchise of Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s chain restaurant and bar, Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s Margaritaville, and a duty-free zone have also been added. Currently under construction is the huge new Royalton Negril Resort.

In recent years, a large development has been constructed consisting of ocean front villas, 2 or 3 bed townhouse developments and studio apartments. This development is known as Little Bay Country Club and is home to some of the wealthiest Jamaican families.

The Reggae Marathon has been held yearly in Negril since 2001. 

In April 2023, the government of Jamaica, announced its plans to build an international airport in Negril. Edmund Bartlett, the Minister of Tourism of Jamaica said that Negril, being a major tourist destination, needs resources and that the town will see development in the new fiscal year. Bartlett said that the development would include an international airport, a public beach park, and a craft village.

==Geography and ecology==
The geography of Jamaica is diverse. The western coastline contains the island&#x27;s finest beaches, stretching for more than along a sandbar at Negril. It is sometimes known among tourists as the &quot;7-Mile Beach&quot; although it is only slightly more than in length, from the Negril River on the south to Rutland Point on the north. 

On the inland side of Negril&#x27;s main road, to the east of the shore, lies a swamp called the Great Morass, through which runs the Negril River. Within the Great Morass is the Royal Palm Reserve, with protected wetlands and forest.

In 1990, the Negril Coral Reef Preservation Society was formed as a non-profit, non-governmental organization to address ongoing degradation of the ecosystem of coral reefs. The Negril Marine Park was officially declared on 4 March 1998 covering a total area of approximately and extending from the Davis Cove River in the Parish of Hanover to St. John&#x27;s Point in Westmoreland.

Scuba diving and snorkeling are especially good in the protected reef areas.

The West End Road is also known as Lighthouse Road as there is a Belgian engineered lighthouse protecting seafarers from the cliffs. There are views from this western tip of Negril, near Negril Lighthouse.

==Popular culture and media references==
*Negril is featured in Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;. One of the schemes of the novel&#x27;s antagonist Francisco Scaramanga was to open a hotel called &quot;Thunderbird&quot; on a Negril beach.

*Negril is mentioned in the lyrics of the 1976 Bob Seger song &quot;Sunspot Baby&quot;, which is the first song on the second side of the album &quot;Night Moves&quot;.

*Negril is mentioned in lyrics of the 1996 Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s song &quot;Jamaica Mistaica&quot;, which is the second song on the album &quot;Banana Wind&quot;.

<doc id="1242747" wikidata="Q5013152" url="?curid=1242747" title="CNN/SI">
<text>CNN/Sports Illustrated (CNN/SI) was a 24-hour sports news network. Created when Time Warner merged its CNN and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; brands, it launched on December 12, 1996.

Other news networks like ESPNews provided 30-minute blocks of news and highlights in a similar fashion to CNN Headline News at the time, but CNN/SI was live daily from 7am to 2am. Its purpose was to provide the most comprehensive sports news service on television, bringing in-depth sports news from around the world, and integrating the internet and television.

==Closure==
CNN/SI&#x27;s closure had been attributed to competition with other all-sports news networks and sports newscasts which started around the same time, such as ESPNews and Fox Sports Net&#x27;s &quot;National Sports Report&quot;. Though CNN/SI aired exclusive content, such as the tape of former Indiana University coach Bob Knight choking player Neil Reed, the channel reached only 20 million homes, not adequate enough to receive a rating by Nielsen Media Research, which reduced sponsorship. ESPNews, in contrast, benefited from being bundled with ESPN (86.5 million homes). The news channel parent CNN did not have the same influence with cable operators for its all-sports news channel. CNN&#x27;s cancellation of their flagship sports program, &quot;Sports Tonight&quot; (which had already been retooled to compete with &quot;SportsCenter&quot;) after the September 11 attacks contributed to the closure of CNN/SI, as it lost all connections to their mother network.

Near its closure, &quot;Sports Tonight&quot; was exclusive to CNN/SI. CNN/SI added NASCAR qualifying, Wimbledon matches, National Lacrosse League matches, and televised the now-defunct Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association

CNN/SI shut down on May 15, 2002. On many cable systems, CNN/SI was replaced by NBA TV. NBA TV, which launched in 1999, eventually evolved into a joint venture between Time Warner and the NBA that officially launched on October 28, 2008.

Following the network&#x27;s closure, its international sports program &quot;World Sport&quot; continues to air, and since 2002 has been produced by CNN International. 

CNN itself would not produce another regular sportscast until 2024, when a new CNN-produced newscast, &quot;TNT Sports Tonight&quot;, debuted on TruTV as part of a plan to increase sports programming on that network.

== Website ==

The CNN/SI name was maintained for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s online presence at cnnsi.com. In January 2013, CNN acquired Bleacher Report and after Time Warner&#x27;s spin-off of their publishing assets into Time Inc. (and subsequently sale to Meredith Corporation and later, to IAC&#x27;s Dotdash), they dropped all use of the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; name.

<text>Jackie Washington (November 12, 1919 – June 27, 2009) was a Canadian blues musician.

==Biography==
He was born and raised in Hamilton, Ontario, the grandson of an African American fleeing slavery, and one of fifteen children born to his parents, Rose and John Washington. Washington became Canada&#x27;s first black disc jockey in 1948, at CHML in Hamilton. He had his own show on CHML from 1948 to 1950.

Washington came from a large family of musicians, including his brothers Reg (Hammond B3) and Dickie (drums). He began singing in public, at the age of five, with his brother Ormsby. In the 1930s, he was one of the Washington Brothers, who played clubs and nightspots until his brother&#x27;s tragic death by drowning. Washington played in various coffeehouses while also working as a railroad porter and later at Fort Erie Race Track. Following a divorce he played far less and was an alcoholic. Following a recovery Washington played with saxophonist Freddie Purser for many years during the 1970s and 1980s at the Windsor and Royal taverns in Hamilton. As a solo artist he appeared at Hamilton`s Festival of Friends a record 29 years. In 1980 Washington played the part of the janitor in the film adaptation of the play: &quot;Hank Williams: The Show He Never Gave&quot;. He also appeared in the 2005 television documentary: &quot;I Want To Be Happy: The Jackie Washington Story&quot;.

His first release as a solo blues artist was &quot;Blues and Sentimental&quot; in June 1976. In addition to his own albums, Washington appeared on recordings by Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton, Joni Mitchell and Gordon Lightfoot. He had also been a regular performer at many Canadian folk and blues festivals, several of which have named awards in his honour. Washington was well known for having a repertoire of some 1300 blues, folk and jazz songs. A diabetic, he lost a leg to amputation and suffered other health issues, yet continued to perform. His fellow musicians ultimately arranged a living trust starting with a tribute concert at the Tivoli Theatre in Hamilton. Featured artists were Jeff Healey, Garnet Rogers and Tom Wilson among others. Jackie then lived in a retirement home until his death. In accordance with his will, his vast music sheets, photographs and videos were donated to the music department at McMaster University. In 2003, a park in Hamilton was named in his honor. It was located near the neighborhood where he grew up. 

He was nominated for a Juno Award in 1993 for Best Roots &amp; Traditional Album, along with Ken Whiteley and Mose Scarlett, for their album &quot;Where Old Friends Meet&quot;. In 1995 Washington was inducted into Hamilton&#x27;s Gallery of Distinction. In 2002, he was inducted into the Canadian Jazz &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

Canadian artist Colin Linden paid tribute to Washington with the song &quot;Jackie Washington&quot;, released on the 2003 album BARK by Linden&#x27;s band Blackie &amp; The Rodeo Kings.

&quot;Jackie Washington Rotary Park&quot; in the North End of Hamilton was named in his honour in 2003.

<doc id="1242756" wikidata="Q62655" url="?curid=1242756" title="George Müller">
<text>George Müller (born Johann Georg Ferdinand Müller, 27 September 1805 – 10 March 1898) was a Christian evangelist and the director of the Ashley Down orphanage in Bristol, England. He was one of the founders of the Plymouth Brethren movement. Later during the split, his group was called the Open Brethren. 

He cared for 10,024 orphans during his lifetime, and provided educational opportunities for the orphans to the point that he was even accused by some of raising the poor above their natural station in British life. He established 117 schools which offered Christian education to more than 120,000.

==Early work==
In 1829, Müller offered to work with the Jews in England through the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews. He arrived in London on 19 March of that year, but by mid-May, he fell ill and did not think that he would survive. He was sent to Teignmouth to recuperate and, while there he met Henry Craik, who became his lifelong friend. Müller returned to London in September, but after ten days started to feel unwell again. He blamed his failing health on his having been confined to his house because of his studies. He asked the Society to send him out to preach but received no reply. By the end of November, he became doubtful whether the Society was the right place for him and on 12 December made the decision to leave but to wait for a month before writing. Müller returned to Exmouth in East Devon, England on 31 December for a short holiday and preached at various meetings while there. He wrote to the Society in early January, requesting that they might consider allowing him to remain with them if they would allow him &quot;to labor in regard to time and place as the Lord might direct me&quot;. This they refused to do at a meeting on 27 January 1830, communicating this to Müller in writing, and thus bringing to an end his association with the London Society. He moved from Exmouth to Teignmouth and preached several times for Craik, which led to a number of the congregation asking him to stay and be the minister of Ebenezer Chapel in Shaldon, Devon, on a salary of £55 per annum. On 7 October 1830, he married Mary Groves, the sister of Anthony Norris Groves. At the end of October, he renounced his regular salary, believing that the practice could lead to church members giving out of duty, not desire. He also eliminated the renting of church pews, arguing that it gave unfair prestige to the wealthy (based primarily on James 2:1–9).

Müller moved to Bristol, England on 25 May 1832, to begin working at Bethesda Chapel. Along with Henry Craik, he continued preaching there until his death, even while devoted to his other ministries. In 1834, he founded the Scriptural Knowledge Institution for Home and Abroad, with the goal of aiding Christian schools and missionaries; distributing the Bible and Christian tracts; and providing Day-schools, Sunday-schools and Adult-schools, all upon a Scriptural foundation. By the end of February 1835, there were five Day-schools – two for boys and three for girls. Not receiving government support and only accepting unsolicited gifts, this organisation received and disbursed £1,381,171 – around £113 million in today&#x27;s terms – by the time of Müller&#x27;s death, primarily using the money for supporting the orphanages and distributing about 285,407 Bibles, 1,459,506 New Testaments, and 244,351 other religious texts, which were translated into twenty other languages. The money was also used to support other &quot;faith missionaries&quot; around the world, such as Hudson Taylor. The work continues to this day.

==Orphanages==

The work of Müller and his wife with orphans began in 1836, with the preparation of their own rented home at 6 Wilson Street, Bristol for the accommodation of thirty girls. Soon after, three more houses in Wilson Street were furnished, not only for girls but also for boys and younger children, eventually increasing the capacity for children who could be cared for to 130.

In 1845, as growth continued, the neighbours complained about the noise and disruption to the public utilities, so Müller decided that a separate building designed to house three hundred children was necessary, and in 1849, at Ashley Down, Bristol, the new home opened. The architect commissioned to draw up the plans asked if he might do so gratuitously. By 26 May 1870, 1,722 children were being accommodated in 5 homes, although there was room for 2,050 (No 1 House – 300, No 2 House – 400, Nos 3, 4 and 5 – 458 each). By the following year, there were 280 orphans in No 1 House, 356 in No 2, 450 in Nos 3 and 4, and 309 in No 5 House.

Through all this, Müller never made requests for financial support, nor did he go into debt, even though the five homes cost more than £100,000 to build. Many times, he received unsolicited food donations only hours before they were needed to feed the children, further strengthening his faith in God. Müller was in constant prayer that God touched the hearts of donors to make provisions for the orphans. For example, on one well-documented occasion, thanks was given for breakfast when all the children were sitting at the table even though there was nothing to eat in the house. As they finished praying, the baker knocked on the door with sufficient fresh bread to feed everyone, and the milkman gave them plenty of fresh milk because his cart had broken down in front of the orphanage. In his autobiographical entry for 12 February 1842, he wrote:

A brother in the Lord came to me this morning and, after a few minutes of conversation gave me two thousand pounds for furnishing the new Orphan House ... Now I am able to meet all of the expenses. In all probability, I will even have several hundred pounds more than I need. The Lord not only gives as much as is absolutely necessary for his work, but he gives abundantly. This blessing filled me with inexplicable delight. He had given me the full answer to my thousands of prayers during the [past] 1,195 days.

Müller never sought donations from specific individuals and relied on the Almighty for all of his needs. He asked those who did support his work to give a name and address so that he could prepare a receipt. The receipts were printed with a request that the receipt be kept until the next annual report was issued so that the donor might confirm the amount reported with what he had given. The wording in the image reads: &quot;Owing to the great increase of my work, I have found it necessary to authorize two of my assistants (Mr. Lawford and Mr. Wright) to sign receipts for donations, if needful, in my stead. Donors are requested, kindly to keep the receipts and to compare them with the &quot;Supplement&quot; to the Report, which records every donation received, so that they may be satisfied that their donations have been properly applied.-The &quot;Supplement&quot; is sent with the Report to every &quot;Donor&quot; who furnishes me with his or her name and address.-I would earnestly request all Donors (even those who feel it right to give anonymously) to put it in my power to acknowledge their donations at the time they come to hand; and should any Donor, after having done this, not receive a printed receipt within a week, they would much oblige me by giving me information at once. This interval must, of course, be extended in the case of Donors who send from places out of the United Kingdom. George Müller&quot;. Every single gift was recorded, whether a single farthing, £3,000, or an old teaspoon. Accounting records were scrupulously kept and made available for scrutiny.

Every morning after breakfast there was a time of Bible reading and prayer, and every child was given a Bible upon leaving the orphanage, together with a tin trunk containing two changes of clothing. The children were dressed well and educated – Müller even employed an inspector to maintain high standards. In fact, many claimed that nearby factories and mines were unable to obtain enough workers because of his efforts in securing apprenticeships, professional training, and domestic service positions for the children old enough to leave the orphanage.

==Evangelism==
On 26 March 1875, at the age of 71 and after the death of his first wife in 1870 and his marriage to Susannah Grace Sanger in 1871, Müller and Susannah began a 17-year period of missionary travel. The table below gives a list of the dates and destinations of their journey.

Müller always expected to pay for their fares and accommodation from the unsolicited gifts given for his own use. However, if someone offered to pay his hotel bill en route, Müller recorded this amount in his accounts.

He travelled more than 200,000 miles. His language abilities allowed him to preach in English, French, and German, and his sermons were translated into the host languages when he was unable to use the three languages which he spoke. In 1892, he returned to England, where he died on 10 March 1898 in New Orphan House No 3.

He was buried at Arnos Vale Cemetery in Bristol. His funeral was attended by 10,000 people, including 1,500 children from orphanages he established.

==Theology==
The theology that guided George Müller&#x27;s work is not widely known, but was shaped by an experience in his middle twenties when he &quot;came to prize the Bible alone as [his] standard of judgement&quot;.

He records in his Narratives 

Müller also wrote of how he came to believe in the doctrines of election, particular redemption, and final persevering grace while staying in Teignmouth, Devon in 1829. George Müller was a founding member of the Plymouth Brethren movement. Doctrinal differences arose in the 1840s and Müller was determined to determine the truth by the &quot;infallible standard of the Holy Spirit&quot;. At the time, he and Craik were pastors of the Bethesda and Gideon fellowships in Bristol. Membership at Gideon was open to all believers, while only believers who had been baptised could claim full membership of Bethesda, although all believers were welcome at Communion. Müller consulted Robert C Chapman on the issue of accepting unbaptised believers, and Chapman stated that distinction should be made between unbaptised believers who &quot;walked disorderly&quot; and those who lived according to the Bible. Müller and Craik independently contemplated the issue and decided that unbaptised believers, who otherwise lived according to Scriptural principles, should not be denied membership.

Dissension arose at Gideon regarding the presence of unbelievers at communion and the view held by some that pews were private property. Eventually, Müller and Craik withdrew from this fellowship on 19 April 1840, concentrating thereafter on the Bethesda Chapel.

John Nelson Darby and Benjamin Wills Newton became opposed concerning certain matters of doctrine and a discussion was held in Plymouth on 5 December 1845. A document entitled &quot;The Principles of Open Brethren&quot; stated: &quot;Certain tracts issued by Mr. Newton were judged to contain error regarding the nature of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the question arose whether it was sufficient to exclude from the fellowship those who held the erroneous teaching, or whether all who belonged to a gathering where the error was tolerated were to be put outside the pale, even if they themselves had not embraced it. One party, led by Mr Darby, took the latter view. Others, in particular the Bethesda Church, in which Messrs Müller and Craik ministered, refused to admit any who were convicted of holding the evil doctrine themselves but did not exclude those who came from Mr Newton&#x27;s meeting. The exclusive party thereupon declined to have any further fellowship with members of the Bethesda Church or others like-minded. The latter soon came to receive the title of &#x27;Open Brethren&#x27;.&quot; The more exclusive side of the brethren movement became known as the Exclusive Brethren and was led by Darby. Darby called on Müller in July 1849 to discuss the split, but Müller had many prior engagements and could only receive Darby for 10 minutes. It was impossible to fully discuss the problem in such a short time, and the two men never met again.

Though the pre-tribulational rapture doctrine gained momentum as a result of the literature of the Brethren movement, Müller&#x27;s church was wary of such teachings. George Müller held to a posttribulation rapture doctrine along with others such as Benjamin Wills Newton and Samuel Prideaux Tregelles, and said that &quot;scripture declares plainly that the Lord Jesus will not come until the Apostasy shall have taken place, and the man of sin shall have been revealed...&quot;

Müller wrote frequently about the stewardship of money and the non-reliance on earthly riches, and how God would bless the man who kept to these principles and felt that laying his own experiences bare would prove the truth of his claims. His personal income, from unsolicited gifts (he refused any kind of salary) rose from £151 in 1831 to more than £2,000 in 1870. However, he retained only around £300 a year for himself and his family, the rest he gave away.

William Henry Harding said, &quot;The world, dull of understanding, has even yet not really grasped the mighty principle upon which he [Müller] acted, but is inclined to think of him merely as a nice old gentleman who loved children, a sort of glorified guardian of the poor, who with the passing of the years may safely be spoken of, in the language of newspaper headlines, as a &#x27;prophet of philanthropy.&#x27; To describe him thus, however, is to degrade his memory, is to miss the high spiritual aim and the wonderful spiritual lesson of his life. It is because the carnal mind is incapable of apprehending spiritual truth that the world regards the orphan Houses only with the languid interest of mere humanitarianism, and remains oblivious of their extraordinary witness to the faithfulness of God.&quot;

==Personal life==

His name is frequently spelled as &quot;Mueller&quot;, particularly in the United States. Whilst &quot;Mueller&quot; is a possible substitute spelling for &quot;Müller&quot; in German, George Müller never changed his name from the original spelling and always took care to place the two dots over the letter &quot;u&quot; to form the umlaut. When asked by his nephew, Edward Groves, what difference this made to the pronunciation, Müller pronounced his name as though it was spelt &quot;Meller&quot;.

===Youth===
Müller was born in Kroppenstädt (now Kroppenstedt), a village near Halberstadt in the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1810, the Müller family moved to nearby Heimersleben, where Müller&#x27;s father was appointed a collector of taxes. He had an older brother, Friedrich Johann Wilhelm (1803 – 7 Oct 1838) and, after his widowed father remarried, a half-brother, Franz (b 1822).

His early life was not marked by righteousness – on the contrary, he was a thief, a liar and a gambler. By the age of 10, Müller was stealing government money from his father. While his mother was dying, he, at fourteen years of age, was playing cards with friends and drinking. While in seminary at the University of Halle in Germany, Müller described his status as one of
&quot;wicked behaviour and unrepentant spirit ... Despite my sinful lifestyle and cold heart, God had mercy on me. I was as careless as ever. I had no Bible and had not read any Scripture for years. I seldom went to church; and, out of custom only, I took the Lord&#x27;s Supper twice a year. I never heard the gospel preached. Nobody told me that Jesus meant for Christians, by the help of God, to live according to the Holy Scriptures.&quot; ...

Then Müller attended a prayer meeting in a private home in 1825 which so moved him that a swift transformation began in his behaviour. &quot;I have no doubt ... that He began a work of grace in me. Even though I scarcely had any knowledge of who God truly was, that evening was the turning point in my life.&quot;

Müller&#x27;s father hoped to provide him with a religious education that would allow him to take a lucrative position as a clergyman in the state church. He studied divinity at Halle and there met a fellow student, Beta, who invited him to the Christian prayer meeting which changed Müller&#x27;s perspective. He was welcomed and began regularly reading the Bible and discussing Christianity with the others in attendance. After seeing a man on his knees praying to God, he was convinced of his need for salvation. He went to his bed, knelt and prayed, and asked God to help him in his life and to bless him wherever he went and to forgive him of his sins. He immediately stopped drinking, stealing and lying, and developed hope of becoming a missionary, rather than the comfortable clergyman that his father had envisioned for him. He began preaching regularly in nearby churches.

===A Life of Prayer===

Müller prayed about everything and expected each prayer to be answered. One example was when one of the orphan house&#x27;s boiler stopped working; Müller needed to have it fixed. This was a problem because the boiler was bricked up and the weather was worsening with each day. So he prayed for two things; firstly that the workers he had hired would have a mind to work throughout the night, and secondly that the weather would let up. On the Tuesday before the work was due to commence, a bitter north wind still blew but in the morning, before the workmen arrived, a southerly wind began to blow and it was so mild that no fires were needed to heat the buildings. That evening, the foreman of the contracted company attended the site to see how he might speed things along and instructed the men to report back first thing in the morning to make an early resumption of work. The team leader stated that they would prefer to work through the night. The job was done in thirty hours.

In 1862, it was discovered that one of the drains was blocked. Being some 11 feet underground, workmen were unable to find the blockage despite several attempts. Müller prayed about the situation and the workmen at once found the site of the problem.

Strong gales in Bristol on Saturday 14 January 1865 caused considerable damage in the area and over twenty holes were opened in the roofs. About twenty windows were also broken and two frames damaged by falling slates. The glazier and slater normally employed had already committed their staff to other work so nothing could be done until the Monday. Had the winds continued, with heavy rain, the damage to the orphanage would have been much greater. After much prayer, the wind stopped in the afternoon and no rain fell until Wednesday, by which time most of the damage had been repaired.

Once, while crossing the Atlantic on the SS &quot;Sardinian&quot; in August 1877, his ship ran into thick fog. He explained to the captain that he needed to be in Quebec by the following afternoon, but Captain Joseph E. Dutton said that he was slowing the ship down for safety and Müller&#x27;s appointment would have to be missed. Müller asked to use the chart-room to pray for the lifting of the fog. The captain followed him down, claiming it would be a waste of time. After Müller prayed a very simple prayer, the captain started to pray, but Müller stopped him; partly because of the captain&#x27;s unbelief, but mainly because he believed the prayer had already been answered. Müller said, &quot;Captain, I have known my Lord for more than fifty years and there is not one instance that I have failed to have an audience with the King. Get up, Captain, for you will find that the fog has gone.&quot; When the two men went back to the bridge, they found the fog had indeed lifted, and Müller was able to keep his appointment. The captain became a Christian shortly afterwards and was later known as &quot;Holy Joe.&quot;

Müller&#x27;s faith in God strengthened day by day and he spent hours in daily prayer and Bible reading. Indeed, it was his practice, in later years, to read through the entire Bible four times a year.

==The George Müller Charitable Trust==

After his life, his work was continued by The George Müller Foundation, which was renamed The George Müller Charitable Trust on 1 March 2009. The Trust maintains the key principle of seeking money through prayer alone – it actively shuns fund-raising activities. The charity works together with local churches in the Bristol area to enable them to reach out and care for their communities, especially children, young people and families with physical, emotional, social or spiritual needs; and encourages giving to support mission, social care, relief and development work across the world. From 1986 to September 2010, it also provided residential care for the elderly in Tilsley House, Weston-super-Mare. The Trust continued to maintain a sheltered accommodation unit for the elderly in Tranquil House, next-door to Tilsley House, until it was closed in 2012.

A small museum maintained by the Trust at its headquarters in Cotham Park, Bristol, is open by appointment only. Records of all children who passed through the orphanage are held and may be inspected by relatives for a modest fee.

== In Media ==
A television docudrama was released in 2006 entitled &quot;Robber of the Cruel Streets&quot;, which presents the life and ministry of George Muller. Beginning with his unprincipled reprobate lifestyle, it relates his subsequent conversion to Christ and life-long mission to rescue street orphans in England during the time of Charles Dickens and Oliver Twist.

<doc id="1242793" wikidata="Q1427297" url="?curid=1242793" title="Flat Eric">
<text>Flat Eric is a puppet character, created by Quentin Dupieux (better known under his stage name Mr. Oizo), from Levi&#x27;s commercials for Sta-Prest One Crease Denim Clothing, built by Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop. His name comes from an idea for a commercial that involved having a car run over his head and flattening it. The idea was not used, but the name stuck.

In the commercials, Flat Eric would ride with his friend Angel (played by Philippe Petit) around California, evading the police as a wanted criminal. As of 2023, Mr. Oizo still uses Flat Eric as a mascot.

==Background==
Flat Eric was based on a dog-like monkey puppet called Stéphane that was similar, but with ears and the hands were fixed. Stéphane appeared in some short films by Mr. Oizo (including a video for the track M-Seq), and had a small cult following in the United Kingdom and France. In March 1999, Levi&#x27;s decided to build a television commercial campaign around the puppet, to be directed by Oizo.

The character was renamed Eric, a more &quot;international name&quot;, in contrast to the original French name Stéphane. The name Eric was chosen after Eric Morand, one of the founders of the record label F Communications.

He was made by Janet Knechtel for Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop, in the United Kingdom, and was performed by Drew Massey for all the Levi&#x27;s commercials. The Levi&#x27;s adverts took three days to shoot. The original short films made with Stéphane cost around 15,000 francs to produce. The two Levi&#x27;s adverts cost around two or three million francs each. The rights to the character were retained by Oizo and production company Partizan.

== Characteristics ==
Eric typically does not speak, communicating only through body language. He has only spoken in the music video for &quot;Flat Beat&quot;, doing so through electronic squawks reminiscent of Miss Othmar in the Peanuts animated specials. These squawks are similar to the ones Stéphane did in M-Seq.
==Appearances==
He was featured in the music videos for &quot;Flat Beat&quot; and &quot;Viandes Légumes Véhicules&quot; by French musician Mr. Oizo and he also appeared as a prop in Series 1 of the 2001 to 2003 BBC Comedy, &quot;The Office&quot;. In August 2004, he co starred with David Soul, in a five million pound television advert for &quot;Auto Trader&quot;. He has also appeared on &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;. The puppet also featured heavily as a prop for more than ten years on SIC Radical interactive chat show &quot;Curto Circuito&quot;, being usually named as &quot;Boneco Amarelo&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;Yellow Puppet&quot;).

Flat Eric has also been featured in many magazines, including &quot;Arena&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Ministry&quot;, &quot;Mixmag&quot;, &quot;Muzik&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;The Face&quot;.

Flat Eric was introduced as an unlockable character in the mobile game &quot;Crossy Road&quot; in a 2016 update, being free for a limited time.

<text>Mikołajki () is a resort town in Mrągowo County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship in north-eastern Poland, with 3,852 inhabitants as of 2017. The town is located near the Śniardwy, the largest lake of both the Masurian Lake District and Poland. It is located in the center of the ethnocultural region of Masuria.

== History ==

Mikołajki is an old Masurian church town first documented as Nickelsdorf (Sankt Niklas) in 1444 and Niklasdorf in 1493. The name refers to Saint Nicholas (&quot;Mikołaj&quot; in Polish). Early on, it was part of the State of the Teutonic Order. In 1454 Polish King and Lithuanian Grand Duke Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region to the Kingdom of Poland upon the request of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, and the Thirteen Years&#x27; War broke out. After the war ended in 1466 it was part of Poland, as a fiefdom held by the Teutonic Knights and, from 1525 on, the Duchy of Prussia, founded as a vassal state of Poland. Similar to all of Masuria, it was mainly inhabited by Poles, hailing from nearby Masovia. In 1539 the inhabitants of the settlement were almost entirely |Poles, who called it by its Polish name &quot;Mikołajki&quot;. First Protestant pastors were mentioned in 1552. The settlement, now within the Kingdom of Prussia, grew during the 18th century, receiving its town privileges as Nikolaiken in 1726. Because of its location on Śniardwy, the fishery of Nikolaiken ensured continued prosperity; the whitefish of the region were especially popular throughout the province of East Prussia.

From 1871 it was part of the German Empire, located within the Sensburg district (&quot;Landkreis Sensburg&quot;) within the province of East Prussia. However, in 1877, the population was still predominantly Polish, mostly of Protestant confession. In the 1898 German federal election, the Polish candidate of the Masurian People&#x27;s Party, Zenon Eugeniusz Lewandowski, who originated from Poznań and was supported by the German Free-minded People&#x27;s Party, received 50% of votes in Mikolajki. 
As a result of the treaty of Versailles the 1920 East Prussian plebiscite was organized on 11 July 1920 under the control of the League of Nations, which resulted in 1,800 votes to remain in Germany and none for Poland. During World War II it was one of the few Masurian towns not destroyed from the fighting, following the war it became again part of Poland under its Polish name &quot;Mikołajki&quot;. The German-speaking population was evacuated and expelled by Polish and Soviet soldiers in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement.

The town was a growing tourist center before the war, and is now one of the largest tourist sights in Masuria. The ice sailing in winter is an especially popular attraction.

==Climate==
Mikołajki has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;) using the isotherm or a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;) using the isotherm.

==Sports==
Since 2005, the Rally of Poland has been based in Mikołajki.

The local football team is Kłobuk Mikołajki. It competes in the lower leagues.

<text>Interstate 865 (I-865) is an east–west auxiliary Interstate Highway northwest of Indianapolis, Indiana. It is a short connector between I-65 and I-465, running for and completely concurrent with U.S. Route 52 (US 52). The highway was originally numbered as a branch of I-465 but was renumbered in 2002 to prevent I-465 from intersecting with itself. This section was previously known as the Dog Leg, and the mile markers ran from 900 to 905.

==Route description==

I-865 begins at an interchange with I-65 in the northwest outskirts of Indianapolis, near Zionsville. The interchange allows for traffic from southbound I-65 to continue east onto I-865 and connects traffic from westbound I-865 to northbound I-65 but prohibits other movements. US 52 is concurrent with the entire length of the four-lane freeway as it travels east across several farms and suburban neighborhoods on the south side of Zionsville. After , I-865 terminates at a three-way interchange with I-465, which continues around Indianapolis as a beltway.

I-865 has interchanges only at its eastern terminus at I-465 and its western terminus at I-65. It is one of the few Interstates that have interchanges only at their termini and none in between. Other examples include I-587 in Kingston, New York; I-381 in Bristol, Virginia; the future I-222; and I-189 in Chittenden County, Vermont.

The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT). In 2022, INDOT measured annual average daily traffic on I-865 at 34,304 vehicles.

==History==

I-865 was originally part of I-465. Original plans were for I-465 to run east from exit 129 of I-65 around the city to exit 123 of I-65. The north–south section of the current I-465 between I-65 and the current I-865 was originally not part of I-465. Instead, it was built to Interstate standards as State Road 100 (SR 100). In January 1970, seven months before it was completed, the federal government approved the request to make it part of I-465. This resulted in an unusual Y interchange of all three branches of I-465 at the current junction of I-865 and I-465. The stretch of I-465 that is now I-865 was given milemarkers starting with 900 to distinguish it from the main portion of the highway.

The unusual configuration caused confusion among motorists, being described as &quot;the 465 connector&quot;, &quot;the 465 extension&quot;, &quot;the 465 dogleg&quot;, &quot;465 second section&quot;, and &quot;the 465 ramp to 65 north&quot;. The May 2002 redesignation of this branch of I-465 to I-865 fixed that problem. The renumbering was approved by the Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in October 2002.

At the time of the redesignation, officials chose &quot;I-865&quot; rather than the also available &quot;I-665&quot; because they concluded that 9-1-1 operators would more easily understand the combination of &quot;8&quot; and &quot;65&quot;.

<text>Samarium(III) chloride, also known as samarium trichloride, is an inorganic compound of samarium and chloride. It is a pale yellow salt that rapidly absorbs water to form a hexahydrate, SmCl3.6H2O. The compound has few practical applications but is used in laboratories for research on new compounds of samarium.

==Structure==
Like several related chlorides of the lanthanides and actinides, SmCl3 crystallises in the UCl3 motif. The Sm3+ centres are nine-coordinate, occupying trigonal prismatic sites with additional chloride ligands occupying the three square faces.

== Preparation and reactions==
SmCl3 is prepared by the &quot;ammonium chloride&quot; route, which involves the initial synthesis of (NH4)2[SmCl5]. This material can be prepared from the common starting materials at reaction temperatures of 230 °C from samarium oxide:
::10 NH4Cl + Sm2O3 → 2 (NH4)2[SmCl5] + 6 NH3 + 3 H2O

The pentachloride is then heated to 350-400 °C resulting in evolution of ammonium chloride and leaving a residue of the anhydrous trichloride:
:: (NH4)2[SmCl5] → 2 NH4Cl + SmCl3

It can also be prepared from samarium metal and hydrochloric acid.
:2 Sm + 6 HCl → 2 SmCl3 + 3 H2

Aqueous solutions of samarium(III) chloride can be prepared by dissolving metallic samarium or samarium carbonate in hydrochloric acid.

Samarium(III) chloride is a moderately strong Lewis acid, which ranks as &quot;hard&quot; according to the HSAB concept. Aqueous solutions of samarium chloride can be used to prepare samarium trifluoride:
:SmCl3 + 3 KF → SmF3 + 3 KCl

== Uses ==
Samarium(III) chloride is used for the preparation of samarium metal, which has a variety of uses, notably in magnets. Anhydrous SmCl3 is mixed with sodium chloride or calcium chloride to give a low melting point eutectic mixture. Electrolysis of this molten salt solution gives the free metal.

===In laboratory===
Samarium(III) chloride can also be used as a starting point for the preparation of other samarium salts. The anhydrous chloride is used to prepare organometallic compounds of samarium, such as bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)alkylsamarium(III) complexes.

<text>An MP3 blog is a type of blog in which the creator makes music files, normally in the MP3 format, available for download. They are also known as musicblogs, audioblogs or soundblogs (the latter two can also mean podcasts). MP3 blogs have become increasingly popular since 2003. The music posted ranges from hard-to-find rarities that have not been issued in many years to more contemporary offerings, and selections are often restricted to a particular musical genre or theme. Some musicblogs offer music in Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) or Ogg formats.

==History==
Among the few first MP3 blogs were Tonspion, Buzzgrinder, Fluxblog, Stereogum and Said the Gramophone. Tonspion is the first MP3 blog in Germany and started in 1998 with reviews and downloads that international artists and labels gave out free on the web. Buzzgrinder began in 2001 as a way for musician SethW to fill time on the road. Stereogum began as a music-related LiveJournal in 2002, though its format was focused on indie/pop gossip rather than MP3s. Fluxblog (also founded in 2002) trumpeted LCD Soundsystem&#x27;s &quot;Yeah (Stupid Version)&quot; in early 2004 brought increased attention to MP3 blogs, while Montreal-based Said the Gramophone, founded in 2003, was among the first websites to write about artists like Arcade Fire, Wolf Parade and Tune-Yards. A July, 2004 story by Reuters and an August, 2004 story on National Public Radio further galvanized the trend, and today there are thousands of MP3 blogs covering a cornucopia of musical styles.

A significant number of indie music labels, promotional agencies and hundreds of artists regularly send promo CDs to MP3 blogs in the hopes of gaining free publicity. Major labels with small acts to promote have also attempted to use MP3 blogs. In 2004, Warner Bros. gave permission for a song by their act The Secret Machines to be posted by the MP3 blog Music (For Robots). This drew attention not only for the song and the label granting permissions, but also because several comments praising the track came from IP addresses within the Warner Bros. network. The publicity generated by MP3 blogs crossed the line from the internet to TV in early 2005, when Music (For Robots) was featured during MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; program for bringing the Hysterics, a Brooklyn rock band composed of four 14- and 15-year-old high school students, to the network&#x27;s attention.

In 2006, Sirius Satellite Radio began broadcasting &quot;blog radio&quot;, a show on the College/Indie Rock channel Left of Center. The show lets music bloggers talk about the latest in the indie-rock scene.

==Aggregators==
Aggregators such as The Hype Machine and Music Blogtrotter track MP3 blog posts and display the most recently updated posts on its front page. The services are meant to provide a snapshot of what&#x27;s going on in music blogging and make it easier to search through recently posted MP3s. The Hype Machine features a list of the most popular tracks of the last three days, as well as the most blogged bands and most popular searches. In June 2009, the popular songs list was altered so that it is only affected by user accounts that are several days old, after it was discovered that the &quot;hearts scores&quot; for dozens of songs were being artificially inflated by dummy accounts, often created in batches numbering in the hundreds. Elbo.ws had a similar feature listing which Bands, Tracks, and Videos are currently &quot;hot.&quot; However Elbo which had been around since 2005 shut down in late 2013. Music Blog Aggregators have caused a boom in MP3 blog readership and accessibility. Aggregators use RSS technology to collect data from MP3 blogs and link to the individual blog posts instead of directly to the MP3s.

The Hype Machine does not list blogs whose writers or editors are involved in the music public relations industry.

== Legal status ==
Many MP3 blogs post copyrighted material as a free download. While this is essentially illegal, record companies often turn a blind eye because of a belief that the blogs constitute free advertising. Bands such as Clap Your Hands Say Yeah and The National have reported increases in sales as a result of attention from MP3 blogs, which often provide links to legal album downloads.

MP3 bloggers commonly post disclaimers stating that all files are intended only for sampling, and often remove posted files within a short period of time.

The economic significance of MP3 blogs is relatively small compared to peer-to-peer networks.

In addition to providing free music, many popular MP3 blogs have started their own DIY record labels, often providing publicizing services free or little money. A few blogs that have emerged in the recent times are Another Banger, Pitchfork, Electro Wow, and Youredm

<text>The Modern Dance is the debut album by the American rock band Pere Ubu. It was released in February 1978 through the label Blank Records.

A 5.1 surround sound version was released as the DVD-Audio side of a DualDisc in 2005.

==Critical reception==

Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1978, Robert Christgau wrote that &quot;even though there&#x27;s too much &quot;Radio Ethiopia&quot; and not enough &#x27;Redondo Beach,&#x27;&quot; he would be &quot;listening through the failed stuff—the highs are worth it.&quot; In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), he reaffirmed that &quot;the highs are worth it, and the failed stuff ain&#x27;t bad&quot; in his revised review. Ken Tucker, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, called it vivid and exhilarating, even if &quot;harsh and willfully ugly&quot;.

&quot;NME&quot; named &quot;The Modern Dance&quot; the 11th best album of 1978. &quot;Fact&quot; placed the record at number 31 on its list of the 100 best albums of the 1970s.

<text>Socuéllamos is a town and municipality of Spain located in the province of Ciudad Real, Castilla–La Mancha. It is famous for its wines. The abandoned town of Torre de Vejezate is located within Socuéllamos municipal term.

== History ==
Juan Osórez, Master of the Order of Santiago, granted a &quot;chartae populationis&quot; to the place of Socuéllamos in the 1290s, in the context of the quarrel of the order with the of Alcaraz. In order to encourage settlement of the territory, privileges of exemption from taxes and tributes (except for the diezmo paid to Uclés) were granted to those who cultivated vineyards.

By the turn of modernity, Socuéllamos enjoyed a scarcely productive yet extensive &quot;encomienda&quot;, whereas it was populated by religious and superstitious Old Christians, with no presence of old &quot;Mudéjares&quot;. Population increased throughout the early 16th century thanks to its strategical crossroads location. In the wake of the 1569 Morisco Revolt, 49 families of unassimilated Granadan &quot;moriscos&quot; (140 members, nearly 20% of the local population) arrived to the village deported from Granada. Possibly a paragon of the climate of intolerance, the inquisitorial coercion reached unheard-of levels during the 1580s, jailing at least 40 Granadan locals. The ethnic strife within the two communities of Old &quot;Christians&quot; and became explosive again years later, and a full-blown pogrom on the community was narrowly averted on 25 October 1609. The convictions of the offenders were eventually dismissed and soon after all the had left the village.

==Sports==
Socuéllamos is home to the Liga EBA basketball team CB Socuéllamos that plays its home games at the Pabellón Roberto Parra.

<text>Richard Mifflin Kleberg Sr. (November 18, 1887 – May 8, 1955), a Democrat, was a seven-term member of the United States House of Representatives from Texas&#x27;s 14th congressional district over the period 1931–1945 and an heir to the King Ranch in South Texas.

Kleberg was first elected in 1931 in a special election to succeed the late Harry M. Wurzbach. His election caused the Democratic party to achieve a majority in the House of Representatives, which it retained for all but four of the next sixty-three years. He was elected unopposed in 1940 and 1942. Lyndon B. Johnson served as a congressional secretary under Kleberg from 1931 until his appointment as head of the Texas National Youth Administration in 1935.

As described by Johnson biographer Robert Caro, Kleberg was a staunch conservative, and initially took a dim view of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. Nevertheless, he was persuaded by Lyndon Johnson to vote for certain key New Deal policies that he personally opposed when it was brought to his attention that they enjoyed significant support among his constituents.

He was defeated for renomination in 1944 by John E. Lyle, Jr., who was elected unopposed that November. Kleberg died in 1955 at age 67.

He was a member of the Miller group in Washington.

<text>World religions is a category used in the study of religion to demarcate at least five—and in some cases more—religions that are deemed to have been especially large, internationally widespread, or influential in the development of Western society. Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism are always included in the list. These are often juxtaposed against other categories, such as folk religions, Indigenous religions, and new religious movements (NRMs), which are also used by scholars in this field of research.

The world religions paradigm was developed in the United Kingdom during the 1960s, where it was pioneered by phenomenological scholars of religion such as Ninian Smart. It was designed to broaden the study of religion away from its heavy focus on Christianity by taking into account other large religious traditions around the world. The paradigm is often used by lecturers instructing undergraduate students in the study of religion and is also the framework used by school teachers in the United Kingdom and other countries. The paradigm&#x27;s emphasis on viewing these religious movements as distinct and mutually exclusive entities has also had a wider impact on the categorisation of religion—for instance in censuses—in both Western countries and elsewhere.

Since the late 20th century, the paradigm has faced critique by scholars of religion such as Jonathan Z. Smith, some of whom have argued for its abandonment. Critics have argued that the world religions paradigm is inappropriate because it takes the Protestant branch of Nicene Christianity as the model for what constitutes &quot;religion&quot;; that it is tied up with discourses of modernity, including the power relations present in modern society; that it encourages an uncritical understanding of religion; and that it makes a value judgment as to what religions should be considered &quot;major&quot;. Others have argued that it remains useful in the classroom, so long as students are made aware that it is a socially-constructed category.

==Definition==
The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson described the &quot;World Religions Paradigm&quot; as &quot;a particular way of thinking about religions which organizes them into a set of discrete traditions with a supposedly &#x27;global&#x27; import.&quot; It typically consists of the &quot;Big Five&quot; religions: Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism. 
As noted by Cotter and Robertson, the &quot;Big Five&quot; religions are often listed in an &quot;Abrahamocentric order&quot; which places the largest three Abrahamic religions—Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—before the non-Abrahamic religions Hinduism and Buddhism. The category is sometimes also extended to include other major religious groups, namely the Baháʼí Faith, Sikhism, and/or Zoroastrianism.

The inclusion of Judaism in the &quot;Big Five&quot; raises some issues; it is included in the list because of its influence on Christianity and Islam and because of its relevance to traditional Western understandings of Western history. On demographic grounds, it does not fit into the list, for there are far fewer Jews in the world than there are Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. Similarly, it does not fit into the list if the groups are defined by a desire to spread internationally, because Judaism historically has been a non-proselytizing religion.

Many scholars have utilised the &quot;world religions&quot; category alongside other &quot;catch-all&quot; categories such as &quot;new religious movements&quot; and &quot;Indigenous religions&quot;. The scholar of religion Steven J. Sutcliffe compared the relationship between the three categories to the English football league system, with the &quot;world&quot; religions forming a Premier League, the &quot;new&quot; religions forming a Championship, and &quot;Indigenous&quot; religions a First Division. That groups that get placed in categories like &quot;Indigenous religions&quot; get treated less seriously than the &quot;world religions&quot; by many scholars was noted by the scholar of religion Graham Harvey, who maintained that &quot;indigenous religions should receive similarly respectful treatment to that considered appropriate to the larger &#x27;World Religions&#x27;.&quot;

==History==
Cornelis Tiele proposed that religions develop in phases, from being nature religions, to becoming mythological religions, then doctrinal religions, and ultimately as world or universal religions. The last stage, qualitatively different in kind, aspiring to be accepted by all men, and based upon abstract principles and maxims. In these categories, Tiele in 1877 placed Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam as universal religions.


Cotter and Robertson noted that the history of the world religions paradigm is &quot;intimately tied up&quot; with the history of the study of religion as an academic discipline. It emerged from within the phenomenology of religion approach which placed an emphasis on description rather than critical analysis.

The paradigm was integrated throughout the education system through work of scholars like Ninian Smart, who formed the Shap Working Party on World Religions in Education in 1969. It was introduced with the intent of moving Western education away from its focus on Christianity. However, it took liberal Western Protestantism as its baseline and interpreted these different religious traditions through the framework of liberal Protestant norms and values. This included an emphasis on theology as being central to a given religion. It also reflects the post-Enlightenment Christian approach of treating different religious groups as distinct, mutually exclusive categories. It thus reflects the socio-political concerns of 1960s Britain, the environment in which it was devised.

The paradigm has since gone beyond this academic discipline, and &quot;informs the perception&quot; of many members of different religious groups. The paradigm for instance frames the teaching about religion in the British education system; at all three Key Stages, British teachers are instructed to teach about Christianity, while by the end of key Stage 3 they are also supposed to teach about the other &quot;five principal religions&quot;: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. Similarly, the censuses of many countries for instance reflect the influence of the world religion paradigm by only permitting respondents to describe themselves as adhering to one particular religious tradition, whereas in reality many individuals identify themselves with various different traditions at the same time. This idea of mutually exclusive religious identities is not only a Western phenomenon, but can also be found in other socio-cultural contexts; Hindu nationalists for instance often endorse the idea that Hinduism and Buddhism are mutually exclusive categories despite the fact that many people in South Asia mix Hindu and Buddhist practices.
The scholars of religion Tara Baldrick-Morrone, Michael Graziano, and Brad Stoddard stated that &quot;the WRP is neither neutral nor natural, but its social authority derives from appearing as both.&quot;

==Criticism==
The utility of the World Religions Paradigm has experienced a sustained and rigorous critique from many scholars of religion. The scholar of religion Graham Harvey for instance noted that many scholars &quot;object strongly&quot; to the paradigm. In 1978, the scholar of religion Jonathan Z. Smith called it a &quot;dubious category&quot;.

One of the major criticisms of the framework is that it is based on a model of &quot;religion&quot; that relies on the Protestant branch of Nicene Christianity as its base example. A second criticism is that it is rooted in the discourses of modernity, including the power relations present in modern society. Smith observed that it was constructed by Western scholars from a Western perspective. He noted that the only religions that get included in it are those which have &quot;achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our [i.e. Western] history, either to form it, interact with it, or to thwart it&quot; and represent &quot;important geo-political entities with which we must deal.&quot; The framework also includes privileging the literate elites active in particular religious movements by presenting their interpretations of particular traditions as being authoritative, eclipsing alternative interpretations presented by non-literate, marginalised, and localized practitioners. For instance, as noted by the scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, &quot;Hinduism as a World Religion does not include Hinduism as a village religion&quot;.

A third criticism of the world religions paradigm is that it encourages an uncritical and &quot;sui generis&quot; model of &quot;religion&quot;. It presents each of the &quot;world religions&quot; in an abstracted and essentialised form, failing to take account of hybridization. For instance, in teaching about Christianity it does not refer to reincarnation, because this is not typically regarded as a Christian doctrine, and yet there are Christians who profess a belief in reincarnation.
A fourth criticism is that in choosing to focus attention on the &quot;major religions&quot;, it makes a value judgement as to what constitutes &quot;major&quot; and what does not.

===Paradigm in pedagogy===

Many scholars of religion have resisted efforts to challenge the paradigm, and as of 2016 was reported as still being widespread in university introductory courses to the study of religion. Many instructors feel that explaining the critique of the world religions paradigm to undergraduate students would be difficult, as the critique would be too complex for many of them to understand. Its continued use has also been defended by the claim that it is what undergraduate students expect and that it mirrors what they will have been taught at school.

Some scholars have argued for the rejection of the world religions paradigm altogether; Cotter and Robertson presented the argument that &quot;the continued uncritical use of the WRP fosters a breeding ground for relativistic navel-gazing which has no place in the contemporary research university&quot;. Owen was of the view that &quot;as long as it continues to employ the World Religions paradigm as a default approach (even after deconstructing it), religious studies will fail in its humanistic task&quot; because it will simply be engaging in &quot;knowledge transfer&quot; and not &quot;critically engaging&quot; with &quot;culture and knowledge&quot;. One alternative framework that some scholars use to teach about religion is the &quot;lived religion&quot; paradigm, which places emphasis not on distinct religious traditions but on individual experiences and practices. Another alternative is the &quot;material religion&quot; framework which focuses on examining religion through material culture and physical objects. Owen noted that, in her experience, many students display an &quot;initial resistance to alternatives&quot; as they are expecting the world religions paradigm. She cited the example of her introductory course at Leeds Trinity University College, which was constructed on thematic lines rather than according to the world religions paradigm, and which induced feelings of panic among many undergraduates.

Many scholars who are critical of the world religions paradigm find themselves having to teach it as part of introductory courses for undergraduate students. Some spent much of a course teaching the concept and then several sessions after this deconstructing it. Some scholars have suggested that even when students are taught using the world religions paradigm, it could be a good means of encouraging them to think critically about category formation. The scholar Steven W. Ramey for instance advocated teaching the paradigm in a manner that makes it clear that it is a &quot;constructed discourse&quot;. Similarly, Baldrick-Morrone, Graziano, and Stoddard suggested that teaching undergraduates about the world religious paradigm helps to explain to students how &quot;classification is a social act&quot;. They noted that students could leave such a course not only knowing more about the specific religious traditions included in the world religions category, but that they would also leave &quot;knowing how to better interrogate the world around them&quot;. To avoid promoting the paradigm&#x27;s portrayal of different religious traditions as rigid, homogenous categories, the scholar Teemu Taira suggested introducing ethnographic case studies into the class to better explain the realities of people&#x27;s lives and uses of religious traditions.

<doc id="1242887" wikidata="Q6768453" url="?curid=1242887" title="Mark L. Schneider">
<text>Mark Lewis Schneider (born 1941) served as the 15th director of the Peace Corps (1999–2001).

==Education and Peace Corps Service==
Schneider grew up in Antioch, California, where he attended Antioch High School and was class salutatorian. Schneider attended U.C. Berkeley on a four-year scholarship and graduated in 1963 majoring in journalism.

Schneider joined the Peace Corps and served in El Salvador with his wife, Susan, then married for one year, where they helped build a bridge across a ravine and introduced a school milk program. As Peace Corps Director Schneider revisited his old site on an official visit to El Salvador in March, 1999. The bridge Schneider helped build is still standing and has been named after him.

Schneider called his Peace Corps service &quot;the most illuminating, rewarding and exhausting period of my life. I saw the constant struggle to survive in the developing world -- children without enough to eat, mothers without access to health care, fathers unable to find work to earn the income to care for their families.&quot; Returning from the Peace Corps, Schneider earned a Master&#x27;s degree in political science from San Jose State.

==Government service==
Schneider was a member of Senator Edward Kennedy&#x27;s staff from 1970 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, Schneider served as a senior policy adviser to the director of the Pan American Health Organization then senior deputy assistant secretary for human rights at the Department of State. During the Clinton Administration Schneider was appointed assistant administrator for Latin America at the U.S. Agency for International Development in November 1993 directing U.S. foreign assistance programs in this hemisphere, supporting democracy, social and economic development and environmental protection.

==Peace Corps director==
President Clinton named Schneider as Director of the Peace Corps in a recess appointment on December 23, 1999. &quot;I want to express my gratitude and sincerest appreciation to President Clinton for the trust he has shown in appointing me to be the Director of the Peace Corps,&quot; Schneider said. &quot;As a former Peace Corps volunteer in El Salvador from 1966-68, this appointment constitutes the highest honor I can imagine receiving.&quot; &quot;The opportunity to follow so many distinguished men and women who preceded me as Peace Corps Director also carries a certain degree of humility. From the Honorable R. Sargent Shriver to Loret Ruppe and Senator Paul Coverdell to Carol Bellamy and my immediate predecessor, Mark Gearan, there is an enormous legacy to which I pledge to contribute to the best of my ability,&quot; Schneider added.

Schneider was the second returned Volunteer (El Salvador, 1966–1968) to head the agency and the first practicing Jew to head the agency. Schneider credits his parents and their Jewish values with motivating him to join the Peace Corps. &quot;I actually do think that the ethics and values that come out of my religious background are reflected in what the Peace Corps does and what the Peace Corps is,&quot; Schneider said.

===Digital Peace Corps===
Schneider launched an initiative at a Peace Corps Day ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Library on March 7, 1999, to increase Volunteers&#x27; participation in helping prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa, and also sought Volunteers to work on information technology projects to enhance development of overseas communities. &quot;This technology will, in my view, simply give volunteers the green light to innovate, in bridging the digital divide, while remaining true to the core mission that President Kennedy set out for the Peace Corps – to help the people of the developing world help themselves,&quot; Schneider said.

==International Crisis Group==
Schneider is a senior vice-president of the International Crisis Group. In this role he has testified before Congress and written op-ed pieces for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; on the political situation in Afghanistan, Haiti, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Pakistan.

===Expansion of the Peace Corps===
On July 25, 2007, Schneider testified before Senator Chris Dodd&#x27;s Senate Subcommittee in support of the Peace Corps Volunteer Empowerment Act and said he was convinced the new legislation contained three critical elements that would enable the Peace Corps to double in size to 15,000 Volunteers by the time it celebrates its 50th anniversary on 1 March 2011. &quot;Those elements are first, authorizing the necessary funds; second, empowering Volunteers which will mean better management, improved programming and site selection, safer and more satisfied Volunteers and third, removal of financial, medical, and bureaucratic obstacles to recruiting senior Volunteers,&quot; said Schneider.

===Situation in Pakistan===
In an Op-ed piece in the August 15, 2007 issue of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;Getting answers on Pakistan,&quot; Schneider argued that time is running out on the military dictatorship in Pakistan and that the United States can either support a return to democracy or sit on the sidelines and watch Pakistan slide in chaos. &quot;If Bhutto and Sharif are not allowed to participate in October&#x27;s election, their mainstream moderate parties will be further alienated, leaving the political field open to Islamist forces,&quot; said Schneider. &quot;The Pakistani people have registered their desire for a democratic transition with street protests, which have been met by guns and gas. This increasingly vocal opposition, spearheaded by the bar associations, human rights groups, and the media, is channeling public resentment to military rule,&quot; Schneider added.

==Other activities==
On November 29, 2007 the State Department announced that Schneider had joined the Democracy Network, a network of former government officials, academics and members of nongovernmental organizations created to help Latin American and Caribbean nations deal with issues related to promoting and defending democracy in the region. The network will advise governments issues like electoral and constitutional reform, access to justice, good governance, citizen participation, transparency and efforts to combat corruption.

==Honors==
Schneider was the recipient of the Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Medal for human rights work from the Government of Chile.

Schneider was a Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellowship at Reed College.

Schneider received a Congressional Fellowship from the American Political Science Association.

Schneider received the Marshall Scholarship.

<text>The Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr (Neonympha mitchellii francisci) is an endangered butterfly subspecies found only in the US state of North Carolina. First discovered in 1983, it was first described by David K. Parshall and Thomas W. Kral in 1989 and listed as federally endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1994. It is a subspecies of &quot;N. mitchellii&quot; and is restricted to a single metapopulation on Fort Bragg military base in Hoke and Cumberland counties. The other subspecies, Mitchell&#x27;s satyr (&quot;Neonympha mitchellii mitchellii&quot;), is also federally endangered.

== Physical characteristics ==

The Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr is a small butterfly with an average wingspan of 34–44 mm. It is dark brown, with distinguishing eyespots along the lower surfaces of both the upper and lower wings. The eyespots on its wings are primarily dark brown or maroon, rimmed with yellow and with flecks of white that reflect silver in the middle. They are usually round or slightly oval and found on the forewing and hindwing. There are two bright orange bands running along the lower wing edges and two darker orange bands across the middle of each wing. Females appear slightly larger and lighter brown than males, which is an example of sexual dimorphism.

== Life history and reproduction ==
Adults live an average of three to four days. The subspecies is bivoltine, having two mating events per year. The first flight period occurs from late May to early June, and the second from late July to mid-August. Females deposit eggs individually or in small clusters that emerge as larvae in seven to ten days. Caterpillars that emerge in early summer period form a chrysalis after two months, while those that emerge in late summer period hibernate over winter and pupate the following spring. Pupation may take up to two weeks. There is little historical information on the life history of the butterfly. Because of this, current research is being done at Michigan State University and North Carolina State University to better understand the butterfly&#x27;s role in its ecosystem.

== Diet ==
One known larval host plant of the Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr is Mitchell&#x27;s sedge (&quot;Carex mitchelliana&quot;), although it is likely that other sedges in the genus &quot;Carex&quot; also act as host plants.

The diet of the Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr as an adult consists primarily of nectar and tree sap. It also has been known to consume dung, pollen, and rotten fruit. In many cases, it is attracted to sodium, resulting in attraction to human sweat.

== Historic and present range ==
The Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr was discovered in south-central North Carolina in 1980. Due to poaching and the lack of monitoring programs, many experts believed the species went extinct. Despite this, the species was rediscovered in 1992. Currently, the butterfly&#x27;s range is completely isolated to the training fields of Fort Bragg, a military base in Cumberland and Hoke counties in North Carolina. Though Fort Bragg is one of the largest military installations in the world, the butterflies only occupy a 10 square kilometer (3.38 square mile) area on the base. Historically, several smaller subpopulations fell within the total range; currently, just a single metapopulation exists. The butterfly continues to be highly restricted in its distribution and has never been found outside of Fort Bragg.

== Habitat ==
The Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr&#x27;s habitat is composed of wide, open grasslands; wetlands; and sedge-dominant ecosystems that experience regular natural disturbance. This disturbance is a result of beaver dam construction, natural fires, rainfall, or flooding. As a generally sedentary butterfly with delicate needs, it is imperative that these natural disturbances are maintained to create the habitat the butterfly needs to thrive. In addition to natural disturbances, the military operations at Fort Bragg create regular disturbances that help form wet meadows on the base. This habitat creation allows the Saint Francis&#x27; satyr population to be maintained at Fort Bragg.

== Present and historic population size==
Currently, not much is known about the butterfly&#x27;s historic population size. From 2002 to 2005, the population size of the Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr was estimated to be between 500 and 1400 butterflies. Usually small, their fragmented sites range from 0.2 to 2.0 hectares in size. Current numbers are estimated to be no more than 1000 individuals with no single population producing greater than 100 butterflies a year. The decrease in population size throughout the years could be a result of fire suppression and beaver extermination.

== Endangered Species Act listing history ==
The butterfly was first listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1994 under an emergency rule, after threats of poaching and loss of habitat increased. Since its listing, there have been notable efforts towards preventing the collection of these butterflies. However, poaching is still a threat due to the butterfly&#x27;s rarity. To combat this, any known listings of colony location sites are kept from the public record. Between 1998 and 2016, more than $3 million was spent on additional conservation efforts for the Saint Francis&#x27; satyr. The main focus for conservation of these butterflies is continuing to preserve and grow the existing subpopulations, as well as enforcing the strict regulations on poaching and collecting. The five-year review for this species suggests the preservation of existing suitable habitats and for continued searching for the establishment of new populations. The IUCN has yet to evaluate the Saint Francis&#x27; satyr.

== Major threats ==
The Endangered Species Act (1973) outlines five criteria for committees to evaluate a species&#x27; status, seen below. At the time of its emergency listing in 1994, the Saint Francis&#x27; satyr faced threats in multiple of these categories.

Destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat or range: The Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr has experienced extensive habitat destruction and modification due to environmental change in the past 100 years. These changes resulted in the loss of the creation of wet meadow habitat due to beaver hunting and control measures, as well as human fire suppression. Experts believe the butterfly used to occupy a larger range but it has been reduced to two counties in North Carolina.

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes: Overcollection for recreational and aesthetic purposes was a serious threat at the time of the butterfly&#x27;s listing, largely due to the butterfly&#x27;s rarity.

Disease or predation: There was no conclusive evidence of disease or predation as a threat to the Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr.

Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms: There were no regulatory mechanisms on the local or federal level in place at the times of its listing.

Other natural or man-made factors affecting continued existence: Natural factors affecting the Saint Francis&#x27; satyr&#x27;s continued existence include limited dispersal ability and the resulting difficulty in establishing new colonies. The natural metapopulation structure of butterfly populations also presents challenges because it increases the likelihood of population destruction in extreme events such as natural disasters. The butterfly also has a higher likelihood of extinction due to disease because of reduced genetic variation in the population.

Anthropogenic factors affecting the Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr&#x27;s continued existence include close proximity to roads increasing the likelihood of butterfly death via toxic chemical spills, pest control programs that help to mitigate the effects of mosquitoes and gypsy moths that harm butterfly populations, and human fire exclusion limiting the formation of habitat land for the Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr. However, its location on the Fort Bragg military base increases its survival because the frequent ecological disturbances created by troop movements allow meadow creation.

== Current conservation efforts ==
Experts recommend downlisting the Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr once two criteria are met: the metapopulation has stabilized or increased in number for at least 10 to 15 years and once there is a long-term plan to manage the species&#x27; survival. To do so, there are regulations and a recovery plan in place.

=== Regulations ===
The ESA prohibits the sale, import, export, and removal of the Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr to limit collection pressures. There are also laws preventing federal agencies from taking part in activities that will harm the species in areas where they are vulnerable, including road construction, pesticide application, and beaver control. However at the time of its listing, there were no laws in place in North Carolina protecting these butterflies. Currently, laws have been passed to protect butterfly populations and their habitat, including regulations for federal agencies, prohibitions of certain practices, and recovery plans.

=== Recovery plan ===
The following recovery plan strives to improve conditions for Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr survival so that it can be downlisted to threatened before being delisted completely. Experts view a stable metapopulation as 200 adult individuals per brood.

Protect and manage existing populations and their habitat: This stage of the plan focuses on three key aspects.

# Monitoring existing populations: A monitoring system has been in place since 2002 and has estimated population sizes at sites found outside artillery impact areas.
# Protecting existing populations: Researchers keep colony locations confidential and restrict military traffic around colony sites.
# Managing for long-term species survival: Researchers develop continual disturbance plans to create meadow habitat. Plans will outline goals, strategies, timelines, and funding sources. However, long-term management plans are incomplete because there needs to be a better understanding of disturbance factors.

Continued research: There is still much to learn about the life history of this butterfly, so research collaborations have been formed with North Carolina State University and other organizations such as the Department of Defense. These collaborations have yielded valuable information regarding population trends, species-habitat interactions, and dependence on disturbance.

Search for additional populations: Researchers have found three new subpopulations, but they are all restricted to Fort Bragg. In addition, the locations of these sites are highly restricted, so it has been difficult to monitor the population&#x27;s health.

Establish more wild populations in historic range: This involves rearing butterflies in captivity for release and protecting habitat suitable for new colony sites. As of the five-year recovery plan in 2013, no new populations had been established. However, restoration efforts in four sites created meadows in 2011 so that they could potentially house future butterfly populations. Once new populations are established, experts hope to increase connectivity between populations by implementing movement corridors.

Implement information and education programs: Since the public plays a large role in conservation, education programs are necessary for the success of this plan. Education plans focus on eliminating illegal collection and creating collaborations with landowners to restore commercial land to habitat suitable for these butterflies. Most outreach has been in the form of publication.

Since the Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr has not yet been downlisted, the five-year review recommends continuance with the goals outlined in the recovery plan in addition to preservation of existing suitable habitat and restoration of new suitable land for colonization.

==Taxonomy==

Following its discovery, the Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr was listed as a subspecies of the Mitchell&#x27;s satyr (&quot;Neonympha mitchellii&quot;). The nominate subspecies, &quot;N. m. mitchellii&quot;, is distributed sparsely in the mid- and eastern US, including in Michigan, Alabama, Mississippi, and Virginia, and formerly New Jersey. Although the Alabama, Mississippi, and Virginia populations are morphometrically similar to Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr, current molecular evidence supports that they are distinct from Saint Francis&#x27;s satyr and that Saint Francis&#x27; satyr should remain as a separate subspecies from all other populations in the genus &quot;Neonympha&quot; with potential elevation to full species status pending further analysis.

<text>In mathematics, the Hodge index theorem for an algebraic surface &quot;V&quot; determines the signature of the intersection pairing on the algebraic curves &quot;C&quot; on &quot;V&quot;. It says, roughly speaking, that the space spanned by such curves (up to linear equivalence) has a one-dimensional subspace on which it is positive definite (not uniquely determined), and decomposes as a direct sum of some such one-dimensional subspace, and a complementary subspace on which it is negative definite.

In a more formal statement, specify that &quot;V&quot; is a non-singular projective surface, and let &quot;H&quot; be the divisor class on &quot;V&quot; of a hyperplane section of &quot;V&quot; in a given projective embedding. Then the intersection

:formula_1

where &quot;d&quot; is the degree of &quot;V&quot; (in that embedding). Let &quot;D&quot; be the vector space of rational divisor classes on &quot;V&quot;, up to algebraic equivalence. The dimension of &quot;D&quot; is finite and is usually denoted by ρ(&quot;V&quot;). The Hodge index theorem says that the subspace spanned by &quot;H&quot; in &quot;D&quot; has a complementary subspace on which the intersection pairing is negative definite. Therefore, the signature (often also called &quot;index&quot;) is (1,ρ(&quot;V&quot;)-1).

The abelian group of divisor classes up to algebraic equivalence is now called the Néron-Severi group; it is known to be a finitely-generated abelian group, and the result is about its tensor product with the rational number field. Therefore, ρ(&quot;V&quot;) is equally the rank of the Néron-Severi group (which can have a non-trivial torsion subgroup, on occasion).

This result was proved in the 1930s by W. V. D. Hodge, for varieties over the complex numbers, after it had been a conjecture for some time of the Italian school of algebraic geometry (in particular, Francesco Severi, who in this case showed that ρ &lt; ∞). Hodge&#x27;s methods were the topological ones brought in by Lefschetz. The result holds over general (algebraically closed) fields.

<text>The Kronoberg Regiment (), designations I 11 and I 11/Fo 16, was a Swedish Army infantry regiment that traced its origins back to the 16th century. It was disbanded in 1997. The regiment&#x27;s soldiers were originally recruited from Kronoberg County, and they were later garrisoned there.

== History ==
The regiment originated in fänikor (companies) and was raised in Kronoberg County in the 16th century. In 1616, these units—along with fänikor from the nearby Kalmar County—were organised by Gustav II Adolf into Smålands storregemente, of which twelve of the total 24 companies were recruited in Kronoberg County. Smålands storregemente consisted of three field regiments, of which Kronoberg Regiment was one. Sometime around 1623, the grand regiment was permanently split into three smaller regiments, of which the Kronoberg Regiment was one.

Kronoberg Regiment was one of the original 20 Swedish infantry regiments mentioned in the Swedish constitution of 1634, although it was mentioned as one of two regiments that should merge to form Småland Regiment, that regiment was never formed and instead Kronoberg Regiment and Jönköping Regiment were kept separate. The regiment&#x27;s first commander was Patrick Ruthwen. The regiment was allotted in 1684. The regiment was given the designation I 11 (11th Infantry Regiment) in a general order in 1816.

Kronoberg Regiment was garrisoned in Växjö from 1920. In 1974, the regiment gained the new designation I 11/Fo 16 as a consequence of a merge with the local defence district Fo 16. The regiment was disbanded in 1997.

==Heraldry and traditions==

===Colours, standards and guidons===
The regiment has carried a number of different colours over the years. The last colour was presented to the regiment in Växjö by the Chief of the Army, lieutenant general, count Carl August Ehrensvärd on 6 June 1956. The new colour replaced the one from 1893. The new colour was used as regimental colour by I 11/Fo 16 until 1 September 1997. The colour is drawn by Brita Grep and embroidered by hand in insertion technique by Libraria. Blazon: &quot;On yellow cloth the provincial badge of Småland; a red lion rampant with blue arms, in the forepaws a red crossbow with white arrowhead and black bow, string and trigger. On a red border at the upper side of the colour, battle honours (Breitenfeld 1631, Lützen 1632, Wittstock 1636, Landskrona 1677, Kliszow 1702, Warszawa 1705, Fraustadt 1706, Holovczyn 1708, Hälsingborg 1710, Valkeala 1790) in yellow&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of the arms of the Kronoberg Regiment (I 11/Fo 16) 1977–1997 and the Kronoberg Group (&quot;&quot;) 1997–2004. Blazon: &quot;Or, the provincial badge of Småland, a double-tailed lion rampant gules, armed and langued azure, in the forepaws a crossbow gules, arrow-head argent, bow and string sable. The shield surmounted two muskets in saltire or&quot;.

===Medals===
In 1971, the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Kronoberg Regiment (I 11) Medal of Honour&quot;) in gold/silver/bronze (KronobregGM/SM/BM) of the 8th size was established. The medal ribbon is divided in yellow, red and yellow moiré.

In 1997, the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Kronoberg Regiment (I 11) Commemorative Medal&quot;) in silver (KronobregMSM) of the 8th size was established. The medal ribbon is of red moiré with two yellow stripes on each side. The ribbon is attached to a narrow pole carried by two slanting ornaments of leaves.

===Heritage===
In connection with the disbandment of the regiment through the Defence Act of 1996, its traditions came from 1 December 1998 onwards to be continued by Kronoberg Group (&quot;Kronobergsgruppen&quot;). From 1 July 2013, the Kronoberg Battalion, within Kalmar and Kronoberg Group (&quot;&quot;) is the traditional keeper of Kronoberg Regiment.

<text>HMS &quot;Carisbrooke Castle&quot; (K379) was one of 44 s built for the Royal Navy during World War II.

==Design and description==
The Castle-class corvette was a stretched version of the preceding Flower class, enlarged to improve seakeeping and to accommodate modern weapons. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by a pair of triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The &quot;Castle&quot;s carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement was 99 officers and ratings.

The Castle-class ships were equipped with a single QF Mk XVI gun forward, but their primary weapon was their single three-barrel Squid anti-submarine mortar. This was backed up by one depth charge rail and two throwers for 15 depth charges. The ships were fitted with two twin and a pair of single mounts for Oerlikon light AA guns. Provision was made for a further four single mounts if needed. They were equipped with Type 145Q and Type 147B ASDIC sets to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water. A Type 277 search radar and a HF/DF radio direction finder rounded out the Castles&#x27; sensor suite.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Carisbrooke Castle&quot; was laid down by Caledon Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company at their shipyard at Dundee on 12 March 1943 and launched on 31 July. She was completed on 17 November and served as a convoy escort until the end of the war in May 1945. The ship was assigned to the Fishery Protection Flotilla based at Devonport in April 1946, but was reduced to reserve later that year.

After the Second World War, her career was spent in the fleet reserve until May 1952, when she became part of the Second Training Squadron at Portland where she remained until 1956. In 1953, she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. She featured in the BBC short docufilm A Brief Journey - sailor&#x27;s run ashore in 1954 to Plymouth, Dartmoor and Looe. The ship was sold and arrived at Faslane on 14 June 1958 to be broken up.

<doc id="1242905" wikidata="Q619599" url="?curid=1242905" title="A Mathematician's Apology">
<text>A Mathematician&#x27;s Apology is a 1940 essay by British mathematician G. H. Hardy which defends the pursuit of mathematics for its own sake. Central to Hardy&#x27;s &quot;apology&quot; – in the sense of a formal justification or defence (as in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot;) – is an argument that mathematics has value independent of its applications. Hardy located this value in what he called the beauty of mathematics and gave some examples of and criteria for mathematical beauty. The book also includes a brief autobiography which gives insight into the mind of a working mathematician.

==Background==
Hardy wished to justify his life&#x27;s work in mathematics for two reasons. Firstly, having survived a heart attack and being at the age of 62, Hardy knew that he was approaching old age and that his mathematical creativity and skills were declining.
By devoting time to writing the Apology, Hardy was admitting that his own time as a creative mathematician was finished. In his foreword to the 1967 edition of the book, C. P. Snow describes the Apology as
&quot;a passionate lament for creative powers that used to be and that will never come again&quot;.
In Hardy&#x27;s words, &quot;Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds. [...] It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics. The function of a mathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to add to mathematics, and not to talk about what he or other mathematicians have done.&quot;

Secondly, at the start of World War II, Hardy, a committed pacifist, wanted to justify his belief that mathematics should be pursued for its own sake rather than for the sake of its applications. He began writing on this subject when he was invited to contribute an article to &quot;Eureka&quot;, the journal of The Archimedeans (the Cambridge University student mathematical society). One of the topics the editor suggested was &quot;something about mathematics and the war&quot;, and the result was the article &quot;Mathematics in war-time&quot;. Hardy later incorporated this article into &quot;A Mathematician&#x27;s Apology&quot;. 

Hardy wanted to write a book in which he would explain his mathematical philosophy to the next generation of mathematicians. He hoped that in this book he could inspire future generations about the importance of mathematics without appealing to its applied uses.

Hardy initially submitted &quot;A Mathematician&#x27;s Apology&quot; to Cambridge University Press with the intention of personally paying for its printing, but the Press decided to fund publication with an initial run of four thousand copies. For the 1940 1st edition, Hardy sent postcards to the publisher requesting that presentation copies be sent to his sister Gertrude Emily Hardy (1878–1963), C. D. Broad, John Edensor Littlewood, Sir Arthur Eddington, C. P. Snow, the cricketer John Lomas (to whom G. H. Hardy dedicated the book), and others.

==Summary==

One of the main themes of the book is the beauty that mathematics possesses, which Hardy compares to painting and poetry. For Hardy, the most beautiful mathematics was that which had no practical applications (pure mathematics) and, in particular number theory, Hardy&#x27;s own field. Hardy contends that if useful knowledge is defined as knowledge which is likely to contribute to material comfort without respect to mere intellectual satisfaction, then most of higher mathematics is useless. He justifies the pursuit of pure mathematics with the argument that its very &quot;uselessness&quot; means that it cannot be misused to cause harm. On the other hand, Hardy denigrates much of the applied mathematics as either being &quot;trivial&quot;, &quot;ugly&quot;, or &quot;dull&quot; and contrasts it with &quot;real mathematics&quot;, which is how he describes pure mathematics.

Hardy comments about a phrase attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss: &quot;Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics.&quot; One may believe that it is the relative sparseness of number theory in applied mathematics that led Gauss to the above statement; however, Hardy points out that this is certainly not the case. If an application of number theory were to be found, then certainly no one would try to dethrone the &quot;queen of mathematics&quot; by it. What Gauss meant, according to Hardy, is that the underlying concepts that constitute number theory are deeper and more elegant compared to those of any other branch of mathematics.

Another theme is that mathematics is a &quot;young man&#x27;s game&quot;. Hardy believed that anyone with a talent for mathematics should develop and use that talent while they are young, before their ability to create original mathematics starts to decline in middle age. This view reflects Hardy&#x27;s increasing depression at the waning of his own mathematical skill. For Hardy, real mathematics was essentially a creative activity, rather than an explanatory or expository one.

==Critiques==
Hardy&#x27;s opinions were heavily influenced by the academic culture of the universities Cambridge and Oxford between World War I and World War II.

Some of Hardy&#x27;s examples seem unfortunate in retrospect. For example, he writes, &quot;No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years.&quot; Since then number theory was used to crack German Enigma codes, and much later figured prominently in public-key cryptography; furthermore, the inter-convertability of mass and energy predicted by special relativity forms the physical basis for nuclear weapons.

Applicability itself is not the reason that Hardy considered applied mathematics inferior to pure mathematics; it is the simplicity and vulgarity that belong to applied mathematics that led him to describe it as he did. He considered that Rolle&#x27;s theorem, for example, cannot be compared to the elegance and preeminence of the mathematics produced by Évariste Galois and other pure mathematicians, although it is of some importance for calculus.

<doc id="1242922" wikidata="Q1044155" url="?curid=1242922" title="Carol Bellamy">
<text>Carol Bellamy (born January 14, 1942) is an American nonprofit executive and former politician. She is chair of the board of the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF). Previously, she was director of the Peace Corps, executive director of the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF), and president and CEO of World Learning. She is also the chair of children&#x27;s rights advocacy organization ECPAT International, working to end the sexual exploitation of children. After three terms in the New York State Senate, she was the first woman to be elected to any citywide office in NYC as President of the New York City Council, a position she held until her unsuccessful bid for Mayor of New York in 1985; she was the second to last person to hold this position.

==Early life and education==
Bellamy was born in Plainfield, New Jersey in 1942, and raised in Scotch Plains, graduating from Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School in 1959. She attended Gettysburg College, where she was a member of Delta Gamma, and graduated in 1963. She earned her J.D. degree from New York University School of Law in 1968, and was a Peace Corps volunteer in Guatemala from 1963 to 1965.

==Business career==
Bellamy was a managing director at Bear Stearns from 1990 to 1993, a Principal at Morgan Stanley from 1986 to 1990, and an associate in the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore from 1968 to 1971. In 1968, she was to be one of the subjects of Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s film &quot;One A.M.&quot; (later released as &quot;One P.M.&quot; by D. A. Pennebaker) where she described her philosophy of using business to accomplish social change. Her speech was then satirized by Rip Torn wearing a US Civil War uniform in front of a Brooklyn middle school class.

==Political career==
===New York State Senate===
Bellamy was a member of the New York State Senate from 1973 to 1977, sitting in the 180th, 181st and 182nd New York State Legislatures.

===New York City Council===
She mounted an uphill campaign for President of the New York City Council in 1977. While her opponents spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in their campaigns, Bellamy carried on with just $90,000 in funds, and, despite her initially low public profile, managed to finish a strong second in the Democratic primary with 25 percent of the vote, behind the incumbent Paul O&#x27;Dwyer, who got 30 percent, and ahead of City Councilman Carter Burden, Assemblyman Leonard Stavisky and developer Abe Hirschfeld. Because no candidate had received at least 40 percent, O&#x27;Dwyer and Bellamy met in a runoff two weeks later, which she won handily, getting 58 percent of the vote. In the November general election, she easily beat the Republican candidate, Assemblyman John Esposito, by a 5-to-1 margin, becoming the first woman elected to citywide office in New York. She held the Council Presidency until her unsuccessful bid for Mayor of New York in 1985.

===Other positions===
Bellamy was a member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Board until she resigned from the board at the behest of Governor Mario Cuomo in 1985. In 1982 she considered running for Governor of New York. In 1990 she was an unsuccessful candidate for New York State Comptroller. She served on the New York State Board of Regents, which oversees all state education activities and the state Department of Education, from 2005 to 2006.

===Peace Corps===
From 1993 to 1995, Bellamy was the director of the Peace Corps. Appointed by then US President Bill Clinton, she was the first director to have previously been a volunteer.

== GCERF ==
As of 2014 Carol Bellamy is the Chair of the Governing Board of the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund which is the first global effort to support local, community-level initiatives aimed at strengthening resilience against violent extremist agendas, for example through job creation and empowering women and youth. As a public-private partnership operating in the fields of security and development, the fund works with governments, civil society, and the private sector in beneficiary countries to support national strategies to address the local drivers of violent extremism.

==UNICEF==
Bellamy was appointed to the position of executive director of UNICEF in 1995 by Boutros Boutros-Ghali, then the Secretary-General of the United Nations. She was granted a second five-year term in 2000 by Boutros-Ghali&#x27;s successor, Kofi Annan. UN policy states that agency heads may serve no more than two five-year terms.

Bellamy is credited with having left behind a fiscally sound organization with strong internal controls. She increased UNICEF&#x27;s resources from roughly $800 million ($966 m in 2004 terms) in 1994 to more than $1.8 billion in 2004.

==NGOs==
Bellamy was appointed the President and CEO of the Brattleboro, Vermont-based World Learning and president of its School for International Training in 2005. World Learning is a global organization with operations in more than 75 countries that fosters global citizenship through experiential education and community-driven development programs. Organizations that fund World Learning include the Tides Foundation and Rockefeller Financial Services.

On July 25, 2007, Bellamy was elected chair of the board of directors of the Fair Labor Association (FLA). The FLA advocates for workers&#x27; interests by promoting international labor standards. &quot;For eight years the FLA has been strengthening its capacity to work with companies, factories, civil society organizations and others to end sweatshop labor and protect workers&#x27; rights. It is now moving beyond its rigorous monitoring program to focus greater attention on identifying the root causes of these problems and to develop sustainable compliance programs,&quot; said Bellamy in accepting the position. 

==Other==
In April 2009, Bellamy was appointed as chair of the International Baccalaureate (IB) board of governors. Between 2010 and 2013, Carol Bellamy was the chair of the Board of Directors of the Global Partnership for Education. Bellamy is a member of the Board of the American University of Beirut.

==Honors==
In 1981, she was selected to be one of the first Young Leaders of the French-American Foundation.

Bellamy is a former Fellow of the Harvard Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government and an honorary member of Pi Alpha Alpha. At its 1982 commencement ceremonies, Barnard College awarded Bellamy the college&#x27;s highest honor, the Medal of Distinction.

Bellamy received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Bates College in 2003. She returned to her &quot;alma mater&quot;, the NYU School of Law, to deliver a commencement day speech in May 2006.

For her work with UNICEF, she was awarded Japan&#x27;s Order of the Rising Sun in 2006. In 2009, she was recognized for her work by France with the Legion of Honour.

<doc id="1242927" wikidata="Q3416239" url="?curid=1242927" title="13th root">
<text>Extracting the 13th root of a number is a famous category for the mental calculation world records. The challenge consists of being given a large number (possibly over 100 digits) and asked to return the number that, when taken to the 13th power, equals the given number. For example, the 13th root of 8,192 is 2 and the 13th root of 96,889,010,407 is 7.

==Properties of the challenge==

Extracting the 13th root has certain properties. One is that the 13th root of a number is much smaller: a 13th root will have approximately 1/13th the number of digits. Thus, the 13th root of a 100-digit number only has 8 digits and the 13th root of a 200-digit number will have 16 digits. Furthermore, the last digit of the 13th root is always the same as the last digit of the power.

For the 13th root of a 100-digit number there are 7,992,563 possibilities, in the range 41,246,264 – 49,238,826. This is considered a relatively easy calculation. There are 393,544,396,177,593 possibilities, in the range 2,030,917,620,904,736 – 2,424,462,017,082,328, for the 13th root of a 200-digit number. This is considered a difficult calculation.

==Records==

The Guinness Book of World Records has published records for extracting the 13th root of a 100-digit number. All world records for mentally extracting a 13th root have been for numbers with an integer root:

* The first record was 23 minutes by De Grote (Mexico).
* The most published time was at one time 88.8 seconds by Klein (Netherlands).
* Mittring calculated it in 39 seconds.
* Alexis Lemaire has broken this record with 13.55 seconds. This is the last official world record for extracting the 13th root of a 100-digit number.
* Mittring attempted to break this record with 11.8 seconds, but it was rejected by all organizations (Saxonia Record club, Guinness, 13th root group).
* Lemaire broke this record unofficially 6 times, twice within 4 seconds: the best was 3.625 seconds.
* Lemaire has also set the first world record for the 13th root of a 200-digit number: 513.55 seconds and 742 attempts on April 6, 2005, and broken it with 267.77 seconds and 577 attempts on June 3, 2005.
* The same day, Lemaire has also set in front of official witnesses an unofficial record of 113 seconds and 40 attempts.
* On February 27, 2007, he set a world record of 1 minute and 47 seconds
* He broke this record on July 24, 2007, with a time of 1 minute and 17 seconds (77.99 seconds) at the Museum of History of Science, University of Oxford, UK
* Lemaire broke his record on November 15, 2007, with a time of 72.4 seconds
* Lemaire broke his record on December 10, 2007, with a time of 70.2 seconds

<text>The Inland Sea, sometimes called Qawra in Maltese and also known as Dwejra, is a lagoon of seawater on the island of Gozo linked to the Mediterranean Sea through an opening formed by a narrow natural arch.

It was probably formed where a geological fault in the limestone had created a sea cave and the roof then collapsed. 

On one side there is a gently shelving stony beach with several fishermen&#x27;s huts. The boats are often pulled up on to the stony beach. The bottom of the lagoon is also mostly pebbles and rocks and is fairly shallow. Exiting through the tunnel towards open sea, the floor drops away in a series of shelves to a depth of up to 35 meters on the outside. It is reported that Jacques Cousteau said the Inland Sea was among his top ten dives.

On calm days fishing boats, known in Maltese as luzzijiet, can pass through the tunnel. Some of the boats are used to take visitors through the archway and then for a tour of the nearby cliffs and other sites, mainly to the Fungus Rock and to the site of the former large natural arch in the cliffs called the Azure Window.

<doc id="1242932" wikidata="Q2236213" url="?curid=1242932" title="Francization">
<text>Francization (in American English, Canadian English, and Oxford English) or Francisation (in other British English), also known as Frenchification, is the expansion of French language use—either through willful adoption or coercion—by more and more social groups who had not before used the language as a common means of expression in daily life. As a linguistic concept, known usually as gallicization, it is the practice of modifying foreign words, names, and phrases to make them easier to spell, pronounce, or understand in French.

According to the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF), the figure of 220 million Francophones (French-language speakers) is underestimated because it only counts people who can write, understand and speak French fluently, thus excluding a majority of African French-speaking people, who do not know how to write.

In 2014, a study from the French bank Natixis claimed French will become the world&#x27;s most-spoken language by 2050. However, critics of the study state that French coexists with other languages in many countries and the study&#x27;s estimates are prone to exaggeration.

The number of Francophones in the world has been rising substantially since the 1980s. In 1985, there were 106 million Francophones around the world. That number quickly rose to 173.2 million in 1997, 200 million in 2005, 220 million in 2010 (+10% from 2007). and reached 274 million in 2014. Forecasts expect that the number of French speakers in Africa alone will reach 400 million in 2025, 715 million (readjusted in 2010) by 2050 and reach 1 billion and 222 million in 2060 (readjusted in 2013). The worldwide French-speaking population is expected to quadruple, whereas the world population is predicted to grow by half.

== Africa ==
Africa has 32 French-speaking countries, more than half its total (53); French was also the most widely spoken language in Africa in 2015.

However, Nigeria, the most populous country on the continent, is predominantly English speaking.

The Francophone zone of Africa is two times the size of the United States of America (including Alaska).

French was introduced in Africa by France and Belgium during the colonial period. The process of francization continued after the colonial period.

French became the most spoken language in Africa after Arabic and Swahili in 2010. The number of speakers changed very rapidly between 1992 and 2002, with the number of French learners in sub-Saharan Africa increasing by 60.37%, from 22.33 million to 34.56 million people. A similar trend in the Maghreb region is occurring. However, as figures provided by the OIF for the Maghreb region were combined with those of the Middle East, the exact count for the Maghreb countries alone is not possible. In this larger region (Maghreb and Middle East), an increase from 10.47 million to 18 million people learning French was observed between 1992 and 2002.

Consideration should be given to the number of French speakers in each country to get an idea of the importance the French language holds in African as a second language.

Many African countries without French as an official language have recently joined the OIF:
*Cape Verde (official language: Portuguese)
*Egypt (official language: Arabic)
*Ghana (official language: English)
*Guinea Bissau (official language: Portuguese)
*Mozambique (official language: Portuguese)
*São Tomé and Príncipe (official language: Portuguese)

The French language currently plays an important role in Africa, serving more and more as a common language or mother tongue (in Gabon, Ivory Coast, Congo, Cameroon and Benin in particular). The African Academy of Languages was established in 2001 to manage the linguistic heritage.

Francophone African countries counted 370 million inhabitants in 2014. This number is expected to reach between 700 and 750 million by 2050. There are already more francophones in Africa than in Europe.

==Asia==
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were once part of French Indochina, part of the French Empire. French culture, in aspects of architecture, culinary and linguistics, has been integrated into the local ones, although the latter remained highly distinct. French used to be the official language and was considerably popular and influential in these colonies, but after they were decolonised and gained independence, the new governments generally removed its influence, by implementing the native language as the only official language in the newly independent states. Currently, the presence of the French language in these countries is minor than before.

== Europe ==

=== England ===

England, and therefore the English language, was deeply francized during the Middle Ages. This was a result of the conquest of England by William the Conqueror from Normandy in 1066, a king who spoke exclusively French and imposed the French language in England. Old English became the language of the poor population and French the language of the court and wealthy population. It is said that during this period, people in England spoke more French than those in France. Today, it is estimated that 50% to 60% of the English language comes from French or Latin.

Cookery gives a good example of this tendency: the names of many farm animals have Anglo-Saxon roots. However, the names of their meat (once exclusive to the wealthy) have Old French origins:

*Pig (Anglo-Saxon) – Pork from the Old French 
*Cow (Anglo-Saxon ) – Beef from the Old French 
*Chicken (Anglo-Saxon) – Poultry from the Old French or 
*Sheep (Anglo-Saxon ) – Mutton from the Old French 

=== France ===
&quot;Francization&quot; is also used to mean any of many cultural assimilation policies implemented by French authorities since the French Revolution. These aimed to impose or maintain the dominance of the French language and French culture. Before the Revolution, French was still a minority language in France by number of speakers, but was the prestige language. The Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts under King Francis I of France prescribed the official use of the French language, the langue d&#x27;oïl dialect spoken at the time in the Île-de-France, in all documents. Other languages, such as Occitan, began to disappear as written languages.

With the decline of Latin, French became increasingly important for writing. Often, people were encouraged or compelled to adopt French, thereby developing a French identity at the expense of their existing one. Use of other languages was often suppressed. This occurred, for example, among the Alemannic-speaking inhabitants of Alsace and the Lorraine Franconian-speaking inhabitants of Lorraine after these regions were conquered by Louis XIV during the seventeenth century, to the Flemings in French Flanders, to the Occitans in Occitania, and to Basques, Bretons, Catalans, Corsicans and Niçards. Corsica passed from the Republic of Genoa to France in 1769 after the Treaty of Versailles. Italian was the official language of Corsica until 1859. Francization occurred in Corsica, and caused a near-disappearance of the Italian language as many of the Italian speakers in these areas migrated to Italy.

Shortly after the fall of the Ancien Régime, the new revolutionary government adopted a policy of promotion of French as a unifying and modernizing language, simultaneously denigrating the status of minority languages as bulwarks of feudalism, Church control of the state, and backwardness in general. In less than a year after coming to power (1792), the Committee for Public Instruction mandated that the newly expanded public education be fortified by sending French-speaking teachers to areas that spoke other languages. This programme achieved many of its aims during the 19th century: by the 1860s, nearly 80% of the national population could speak French.
After the Treaty of Turin was signed in 1860 between the Victor Emmanuel II and Napoleon III as a consequence of the Plombières Agreement, the County of Nice was ceded to France as a territorial reward for French assistance in the Second Italian War of Independence against Austria, which saw Lombardy united with Piedmont-Sardinia. The Italian language was the official language of the County of Nice, used by the Church, at the town hall, taught in schools, used in theaters and at the Opera, was immediately abolished and replaced by French. The French government implemented a policy of Francization of society, language and culture of the County of Nice. The toponyms of the communes of the ancient County have been francized, with the obligation to use French in Nice, as well as certain surnames (for example the Italian surname &quot;Bianchi&quot; was francized into &quot;Leblanc&quot;, and the Italian surname &quot;Del Ponte&quot; was francized into &quot;Dupont&quot;).

By 1900, French had become the mother tongue of the majority of adults in France. Jules Ferry introduced free, compulsory education during the French Third Republic, and openly tried to strengthen the centralised state by instilling a French national identity in the population. French was presented as the language of modernity, as opposed to regional languages such as Breton or Basque, labelled as barbaric or tribal. Pupils caught speaking these languages were punished by making them display tokens of shame. In Occitan-speaking areas that school policy was called the &quot;vergonha&quot;. 

Historically, no official language was recognized by the French Constitution. In 1994, French was declared constitutionally to be the language of the French Republic. In 1998, France became a signatory of the European Charter on Minority Languages; however, it has yet to ratify it, with general agreement among the political class that supportive measures are neither popular enough to attract wide support nor banal enough to be uncontroversial, with concerns specifically about courts forcing the state to act if the rights enshrined in the charter are recognised.

Initiatives to encourage the use of minority languages are limited by the refusal of the French Government to recognize them, on the basis of the French Constitution, which states that &quot;The language of the Republic of France is French&quot;. This view was upheld in 2021, when Deputy Paul Molac unexpectedly won a majority vote in the French National Assembly to allow for immersive education in minority languages in state-run schools. The Assembly&#x27;s decision was immediately contested by the French Constitutional Council, which struck out the parliament&#x27;s vote. The council also deemed unconstitutional the use of diacritical marks not used in French, such as the tilde in &quot;ñ&quot;.

===Belgium===

====Brussels and the Flemish periphery====
In the last two centuries, Brussels transformed from an exclusively Dutch-speaking city to a bilingual city with French as the majority language and lingua franca. The language shift began in the eighteenth century and accelerated as Belgium became independent and Brussels expanded beyond its original city boundaries. From 1880 onwards, more and more Dutch-speaking people became bilingual, resulting in a rise of monolingual French speakers after 1910. Halfway through the twentieth century, the number of monolingual French-speakers carried the day over the (mostly) bilingual Flemish inhabitants. Only since the 1960s, after the fixation of the Belgian language border and the socio-economic development of Flanders was in full effect, could Dutch stem the tide of increasing French use. The francization of the Flemish periphery around Brussels still continues because of the continued immigration of French speakers coming from Wallonia and Brussels.

=== Canada ===

====Quebec====

The Government of Quebec has francization policies intended to establish French as the primary language of business and commerce. All businesses are required to provide written communications and schedules in French, and may not make knowledge of a language other than French a condition of hiring unless this is justified by the nature of the duties. Businesses with more than fifty employees are required to register with the Quebec Office of the French language in order to become eligible for a francization certificate, which is granted if the linguistic requirements are met. If not, employers are required to adopt a francization programme, which includes having employees, especially ones in managerial positions, who do not speak French or whose grasp of French is weak attend French-language training.

As part of the francization programme, the Quebec government provides free language courses for recent immigrants (from other countries or other provinces) who do not speak French or whose command of French is weak. The government also provides financial assistance for those who are unable to find employment because they are unable to speak French.

Another aspect of francization in Quebec regards the quality of the French used in Quebec. The Quebec Office of the French language has, since its formation, undertaken to discourage anglicisms and to promote high standards of French-language education in schools.
The francization programs have been considered a great success. Although French as a mother tongue has gone from 80.6% to 77.4% in the province between 1971 and 2016, knowledge of French among the province&#x27;s population went from 88.5% to 94.5% over the same period. English as a mother tongue fell from 13.1% to 8.8% of the province&#x27;s population between 1971 and 2016 while knowledge of French among people with English as a mother tongue rose from 37% to 69% over the same period. 
In 1971, only 14.6% of allophone students were studying in a French school. In 2012, that number had reached 87.5% 

Montreal is a particular interesting case because, unlike the rest of Quebec, the French-speaking proportion of the population diminished. However, this does not mean that the francization programmes failed, as the share of English speakers diminished as well; it seems more likely that the decrease was caused by the fact that 93% of new immigrants to Quebec choose to settle in Montreal, with a corresponding rise in languages other than English and French. The government of Quebec estimates that, over the next 20 years, the Francophone proportion of Montreal will increase again.

But those estimations seem to underestimate the francization of Montreal for some experts, because statistics show that the proportion has already risen from 55.6% (1996) to 56.4% (2001).

The success of francization of Quebec can also be seen over the borders of its territory: in Ontario, the proportion of English speakers dropped from 70.5% in 2001 to 68% in 2006, while the proportion of French speakers went up from 4.06% (488 815) in 2006 to 4.80% (580 000) in 2009. However, this statistic must be examined in conjunction with the effects of Quebec francophone out-migration. Interprovincial migration, especially to Ontario, results in a net loss of population in Quebec. The number of French-speaking Quebecers leaving the province tends to be similar to the number entering, while immigrants to Quebec tend to leave.

None of the Quebec statistics are adjusted to compensate for the percentage—approximately 20%—of Anglophones who departed the province by the mid-1980s as a consequence of linguistic nationalism. By 2001, over 60% of the 1971 population of Quebec Anglophones had left the province.

The Charter of the French Language has been a complete success, according to Hervé Lavenir de Buffon (general secretary of the &quot;Comité international pour le français, langue européenne&quot;), who said in 2006: &quot;Before Bill 101, Montreal looked like an American city. Now Montreal looks like a French-speaking city; that proves how well Bill 101 has worked!&quot;

==== New Brunswick ====
The policy has been even more successful in New Brunswick, for example: the city of Edmundston went from around 89% French-speaking in 1996 to 93.4% in 2006, the city of Moncton from 30.4% in 1996 to 33% in 2006, Dalhousie (from 42.5% to 49.5%) and Dieppe (from 71.1% in 1996 to 74.2% in 2006). Some cities even passed 50% of French speakers between 1991 and 2006 like Bathurst, which passed from 44.6% of French speakers in 1996 to 50.5% in 2006, or Campbellton, from 47% in 1996 to 55% in 2006.

Rates of francization may be established for any group by comparing the number of people who usually speak French to the total number of people in the minority language group. See Calvin Veltman&#x27;s &quot;Language Shift in the United States&quot; (1983) for a discussion.

==Of the language==
There are many examples of francization in history and popular culture:
* replacing the word &quot;custard&quot; on restaurant menus.
*Anne Boleyn choosing the French spelling &quot;Boleyn&quot; over the traditional English &quot;Bolin&quot; or &quot;Bullen&quot;.
*Mary, Queen of Scots, choosing the spelling Stuart over &quot;Stewart&quot; for the name of her dynasty. (The Scots had dual nationality and Mary, Queen of Scots was brought up in France.)
*The common &quot;-esc&quot;u&quot;&quot; final particle in Romanian being traditionally changed to &quot;-esc&quot;o&quot;&quot; in French spellings and being occasionally adopted by the persons themselves as a French equivalent of their names (&quot;see Eugène Ionesco, Irina Ionesco, Marthe Bibesco&quot;).
*, short for , replacing e-mail (originally from Quebec).

The same exists for other languages, for example, English, in which case objects or persons can be anglicized.

<doc id="1242933" wikidata="Q942157" url="?curid=1242933" title="Hawaiian duck">
<text>The Hawaiian duck (Anas wyvilliana) or koloa is a species of bird in the family Anatidae that is endemic to the large islands of Hawaii. Taxonomically, the koloa is closely allied with the mallard (&quot;A. platyrhynchos&quot;). It differs in that it is monomorphic (with similarly marked males and females) and non-migratory. As with many duck species in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;, Hawaiian duck and mallards can interbreed and produce viable offspring, and the koloa has previously been considered an island subspecies of the mallard (&quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot;). However, all major authorities now consider this form to be a distinct species within the mallard complex. Recent analyses indicate that this is a distinct species that arose through ancient hybridization between mallard and the Laysan duck (&quot;Anas laysanensis&quot;). The native Hawaiian name for this duck is koloa maoli (meaning &quot;native duck&quot;), or simply koloa. This species is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and its population trend is increasing.

==Physiology==

===Appearance===
Both male and female are mottled brown in color and resemble a female mallard. The males are usually bigger than the females. The speculum feathers of both sexes are green to blue, bordered on both sides by white. The tail is dark overall, unlike the black-and-white tail of a mallard. The feet and legs are orange to yellow-orange. The bill is olive green in the male and dull orange with dark markings in the female. The adult male has a darker head and neck. The female is generally lighter-colored than the male and has plain back feathers. A first-year male Hawaiian duck looks like an eclipse-plumaged male mallard. Seasonal plumage differences, individual variation, and variation between islands can make it difficult to differentiate between Hawaiian ducks, female mallards and hybrids of Hawaiian ducks and mallards. In addition, the extent of hybridization at a location can contribute to the difficulty of identification.

===Body size===
The male Hawaiian duck has an average length of and the female has an average length of . On average, the male weighs and the female weighs . The Hawaiian duck is typically smaller than the mallard by 20 to 30 percent.

===Diet===
Hawaiian ducks are &quot;opportunistic feeders&quot;. Their diet consists of freshwater vegetation, mollusks, insects, and other aquatic invertebrates. Specifically, they are known to consume snails, insect larvae, earthworms, tadpoles, crayfish, mosquito larvae, mosquito fish, grass seeds, rice, and green algae.

===Vocalization===
The Hawaiian duck quacks like a mallard, but its call is softer and it quacks less frequently.

==Behavior==
The Hawaiian duck is a very wary bird, often found in pairs instead of large groups. The koloa is most prominently found residing in the tall, wetland grasses and streams near the Kohala volcano on the main island of Hawaiʻi. They are very secretive birds and do not associate with other animals.

==Reproduction==
Some pairs nest year-round, but the primary breeding season is from December to May, during which pairs often engage in spectacular nuptial flights. The clutch size is usually eight. The female lays two to ten eggs in a well-concealed nest lined with down and breast feathers. Incubation lasts about four weeks. The young can take to the water soon after hatching, but cannot fly until about nine weeks of age. Offspring become sexually mature enough to reproduce after a year.

A potential conservation problem is hybridizing with the mallard. It is currently unknown whether the female Hawaiian duck attracts the male mallard or whether the color variation of the male mallard attracts the female. In any case, evolution has not moved fast enough for the species to reach reproductive isolation, since this interbreeding creates viable hybrids. This interbreeding is one of the main causes for the endangerment of the Hawaiian duck.

==Location and environment==
The former range of the Hawaiian duck included all of the main Hawaiian islands except the islands of Lānaʻi and Kaho’olawe.   Hawaiian ducks were found on the hottest coasts with suitable ponds as well as in the mountains that were up to high.(Perkins 1903, cited in Banko 1987b). This includes low wetlands, river valleys, and streams in mountains. &quot;Genetically-pure Koloa populations were believed to occur on the islands of Kaua&#x27;i. Ni&#x27;ihau, and highlands of Hawai&#x27;i with hybrid swarms on O&#x27;ahu and Maui, but there is now evidence of hybridization within pure populations.&quot; The Hawaiian duck was extirpated on all other islands, but was subsequently reestablished on Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi, and Maui through release of captive-reared birds. However, all the Hawaiian ducks in the reestablished populations have bred with feral mallard ducks and have produced hybrid offspring that are fully fertile; consequently, &quot;pure&quot; Hawaiian ducks are still only found on Kauaʻi. With an approximate population of 2,200 birds. This consists of 2,000 on Kaua`i and 200 on Hawaiʻi. However, these ducks are in decline due to hybridization. They are also vulnerable to predators because of the low location of their nests on the ground. This makes it easier for invasive predators such as cats, pigs, dogs, and mongooses to attack them. In addition to predators, Kauai has experienced a loss of lowland wetland habitat, in turn affecting the Hawaiian ducks.

==Conservation status==
Wildlife refuges including Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge on Kaua&#x27;i are essential breeding areas for Hawaiian ducks. The species was reintroduced to O’ahu between 1958 and 1982. In 1989, twelve of these captured birds were released on the island of Maui. The species was also reestablished on the island of Hawai&#x27;i between 1976 and 1982 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). Throughout the 1980s, the importation of mallards to Hawai&#x27;i was limited in an effort to reduce hybridization with Hawaiian ducks. Other conservation efforts for the Hawaiian duck include the development of &quot;techniques for the identification of hybrids&quot;, which in turn will result in &quot;simultaneous genetic testing and morphological characterisation&quot;.

===Hybridization===

Hybridization is arguably one of the most serious but overlooked threats to the Hawaiian duck, specifically interbreeding between Hawaiian ducks and feral mallards. Since hybridization has been happening for an extended period of time, it is unlikely there are any pure individuals of the species left. &quot;Determination of the population status of Hawaiian ducks and whether there are any pure Hawaiian ducks left on O`ahu will require simultaneous genetic testing and morphological characterization to develop reliable morphological criteria for distinguishing Hawaiian ducks, female mallards, and hybrids. Once such criteria are available they can be used to identify birds for removal in order to reduce interbreeding and introgression.&quot;

It has been shown that offspring between mallards and the Hawaiian duck produce fertile offspring. It has also been shown on Kauai that breeding Hawaiian duck/mallard crosses with Hawaiian ducks over time reduces the expression of the mallard genes showing promise to restoring the natural population. Efforts are underway to remove mallards from the islands in order to preserve the genetic diversity of the Hawaiian duck.

==Other factors influencing population==
The Hawaiian duck&#x27;s population is affected by habitat loss, modifications to wetland habitats for flood control, non-native invasive plants, diseases, environmental contaminants, hunting and predation. The primary avian diseases of concern in Hawai’i are avian malaria and avian pox, which have devastated forest birds and greatly limited their distributions (Reed, et al. 2012). Predation threats to the koloa maoli include feral cats, rats, and small Indian mongooses, which eat the eggs and young.

Other ways that the Hawaiian ducks are being threatened is through the predation of dogs, introduced fish, and also other birds that are being introduced into their habitat. The previous hunting of water birds in these area from 1800s to the 1900s also played a major role in the decline of this species. Urban development along with loss of their natural habitat due to the use of the land for local agriculture plays a major role to the indefinite decline of this now endangered species. Amongst the threat of urban development certain problems arise such as human disturbance, whether it be recreation or through tourism. Through their constant migration from their ever-degrading habitat, another obstacle arises, that which is drought. In the late 1800s, the mallard, also known as &quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot;, were flown in to stock up the ponds of Hawaiʻi for ornamental purposes, but soon enough they were massively imported throughout the 1950s and the 1960s.

Interbreeding with feral mallards is the result, as the hybrids seem to be less well adapted to the local ecosystem. This interbreeding is rather common due to the high numbers of feral mallards. Several attempted reintroductions have already failed due to the hybrid ducks produced in captivity faring badly in the wild. The &quot;conversion of flooded taro fields to dry sugar-cane acreage&quot; destroys parts of this species&#x27; habitat.

===Conservation actions===
Throughout the cold winters a wild refuge is a very important factor for this species. The Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge makes this all possible for the &quot;Anas wyvilliana&quot; to procreate when their habitat is not suitable for their survival. The species was then for the first time introduced into O’ahu where only a scarce amount of almost 326 captive birds of the species were released into the wilderness between the years of 1958 and 1982. Later on in 1989 only twelve of these captured birds were released into the island of maui. Due to these efforts to conserve and procreate, the species was finally reestablished on the Big Island between 1976 and 1982. Throughout the later years in the 1980s, &quot;the importation of &quot;A. platyrhynchos&quot; was restricted by the state, with exceptions only for research and exhibition&quot;. Other efforts have or are being done to further progress the conservation of the &quot;Anas wyvilliana&quot; such as development of, &quot;techniques for the identification of hybrids&quot;. This will result in &quot;simultaneous genetic testing and morphological characterisation&quot;.

===Endangerment recovery===
Many plans for this species&#x27; survival has been set, but there is still much more information required in order to obtain maximum results. More information is still required for distinguishing hybrids (visually is too difficult, requires genetic screening), conserving habitat, examining migratory patterns and measuring the extent different wetlands affect the Hawaiian duck. It is an ongoing issue that requires constant attention, the more accurate the research is, the better of an idea we have of where money should be spent to help the Hawaiian duck survive. With that said, the Hawaiian Bird Conservation Action Plan has come up with a five-year plan to hopefully negate some of the species&#x27; main threats such as hybridization, habitat restoration/management and predator control. They want to &quot;manage hybridization on all islands by removing feral Mallards and hybrids to the maximum extent practicable.&quot; Other conservation plans include plans to &quot;obtain public acceptance of feral duck control&quot;, &quot;continue protection and restoration of important wetland habitats&quot;, and &quot;develop alternative predator control methods and explore the use of predator fences.&quot;*

<text>The Mexican duck (Anas diazi) is a species of dabbling duck that breeds in Mexico and the southwestern United States.

==Distribution and habitat==
Most of the population is resident, but some northern birds migrate south to Mexico in winter. The species also occurs widely, but in limited numbers, in Colorado in all seasons and there are photographs of birds referable to this taxon from Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Montana.

It is a bird of most wetlands, including ponds and rivers, and usually feeds by dabbling for plant food or grazing. It nests usually on a river bank, but not always particularly near water.

==Diet==
Mexican ducks are fond of the green shoots of alfafa and feed at night on irrigated fields.

==Description==
Both sexes of this 51–56 cm length bird resemble a female mallard, but with a slightly darker body. The Mexican duck is mainly brown, with a blue speculum edged with white, obvious in flight or at rest. The male has a brighter yellow bill than the female.

==Call==
The male has a nasal call, whereas the female has the very familiar &quot;quack&quot; commonly associated with ducks.

==Taxonomy==
Including the Mexican duck in the mallard is a relic from the usual practice of much of the mid-late 20th century, when all North American &quot;mallardines&quot; as well as the Hawaiian and Laysan ducks were included in the mallard proper as subspecies. This was based on the assumption that hybridization, producing fertile offspring, is an indicator of lack of speciation.

Rather, in these birds it indicates a fairly recent allopatric radiation, which has not yet established solid barriers against gene flow on the molecular level; mate choice is conferred by cues of behavior and plumage in the mallardine ducks, and this, under natural conditions, has precluded a strong selective pressure towards establishment of genetic incompatibility.

==Conservation status==
Although a species of least concern, the Mexican duck is undergoing a slow but marked decline due to destruction of habitat and overhunting. It hybridizes with mallards which are better-adapted to utilizing habitat altered by human activity and thus are spreading throughout this range. Concern has been expressed that this combination of factors may ultimately lead to the disappearance of the Mexican duck as a recognizable taxonomic entity (Rhymer &amp; Simberloff 1996, McCracken &quot;et al.&quot; 2001, Rhymer 2006), but fairly limited measures such as wetland preservation and preferential hunting of drake mallards would prevent this. The Mexican duck was listed as endangered species at the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1967 but was removed in 1978.

<text>The BR Standard Class 2 2-6-0 is a class of steam locomotive, one of the British Railways Standard classes of the 1950s. They were physically the smallest of the Standard classes; 65 were built.

==Overview==
The design was derived from the Ivatt-designed Class 2 2-6-0, with a reduced cab to enable it to fit into a universal loading gauge, and other standard fittings, most notably a taller chimney, others including the lack of an Ivatt dome and side plates connecting the two sections of the engine. Like the LMS predecessor the BR design had a tender cab to enhance crew protection and visibility when running tender-first. They were all attached to a BR3 type tender. These locomotives are often known by the nickname &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;.

==Construction==
Darlington works was responsible for building the entire fleet of 65 engines and for a time construction of the LMS and BR designs overlapped. The last No. 78064 was completed in 1956 but the class remained intact for just seven years. Coincidentally the first to be withdrawn No. 78015 was a Darlington-based engine.

==Route availability==
Like the LMS counterpart, the Standard Mogul was arranged for a low axle-loading of just . This allowed it to operate on most lightly laid routes and secondary lines. The route availability was 3. Some of the class had speedometers fitted.

==Reputation==
Among crews the 2MT 2-6-0 gained a reputation for being very sure-footed. Some maintained however that the engine did not steam well. The most common complaint was the draughty and dirty footplate. This was unusual, given Robert Riddles and his team made an effort to optimise working conditions in the Standards&#x27; cab layout.

==Shed allocations==
Two former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway sheds (Bank Hall (Liverpool) and Wigan (L&amp;Y), respectively), designated 27A and 27D, received an allocation of the class. Bank Hall had 78041–44 which were used with great success on both slow and fast trains from Liverpool Exchange to either Preston, Bolton or Rochdale. The Wigan engines 78040/61–64 were used on stopping trains to Liverpool, Southport, Bolton and Rochdale. They replaced LMS Class 2P 4-4-0s and L&amp;YR 2-4-2Ts. On the former L&amp;Y lines this class was generally employed on passenger work whilst the LMS Class 2 2-6-0s were normally found on shunting and freight jobs until the mid-1960s. 

When the Cambrian section closed and other areas dieselised, other members of the class came to the former L&amp;Y lines (some as replacements for those originally allocated to 27A and 27D). These included 78002 (in green livery), 78007, 78027 and 78057. Some of these were used on shunting duties from Bolton and Lostock Hall sheds. Number 78022 preserved on the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway had a spell as Preston station passenger pilot whilst allocated to Lostock Hall.

==Withdrawal==
== Preservation ==
Four members of the class survived into preservation, however one member of the class (78059) is currently in the process of being converted to the tank version of the class.

<text>Strange Days at Blake Holsey High (also known as Black Hole High) is a science fiction television series which first aired in North America in October 2002 on Global TV. It is set at the fictional boarding school of the title, where a Science Club (five students and their teacher) investigates mysterious phenomena, most of which is centered on a wormhole located on the school grounds. Spanning four seasons, the series developed into a success, and has been sold to networks around the globe.

Created by Jim Rapsas, the series intertwines elements of mystery, drama, romance, and comedy. The writing of the show is structured around various scientific principles, with emotional and academic struggles combined with unfolding mysteries of a preternatural nature. In addition to its consistent popularity among children, it has been recognised by adults as strong family entertainment. Forty-two episodes of the series, each roughly twenty-five minutes in length, have been produced, the last three of which premiered in January 2006. Those three final episodes that aired were combined into a film, &quot;Strange Days: Conclusions&quot;. The show was filmed at the Auchmar Estate on the Hamilton Escarpment in Hamilton, Ontario.

==Premise==
The show revolves around a group of five friends and their favorite teacher. Together they join the Science Club at Blake Holsey High, a boarding school located in southern Ontario. The name &quot;Blake Holsey&quot; is a pun on the concept of a black hole in that preternatural events constantly happen at the school and affect the students, sometimes as an unexpectedly drastic consequence of their own minor misbehavior. The school&#x27;s science club considers what a wormhole, a floating Qigong ball, and Pearadyne Industries, a lab that was destroyed years ago right next to the school, all have to do with the mystery.

==Characters==
* Josie Trent (portrayed by Emma Taylor-Isherwood) is the show&#x27;s main protagonist, an intelligent and curious new student who transfers to Blake Holsey High at the beginning of the series, and is the one who discovered the wormhole first.
* Corrine Baxter (portrayed by Shadia Simmons) is Josie&#x27;s best friend and roommate, Corrine is the so-called &quot;brains&quot; (with a self-claimed IQ of 172) in the Science Club.
* Lucas Randall (portrayed by Michael Seater) is a conspiracy theorist and the most driven member of the Science Club.
* Marshall Wheeler (portrayed by Noah Reid) is Lucas&#x27; best friend and roommate, Marshall is more social and fun loving than Lucas.
* Vaughn Pearson (portrayed by Robert Clark) is the fifth student in the Science Club. Vaughn is intelligent but sometimes struggles in school as a result of dyslexia and has preferred pursuing athletic activities. His father is Victor Pearson, the owner and founder of Pearadyne Industries.
* Professor Noel Zachary (portrayed by Jeff Douglas) – Professor Zachary, or &quot;Z&quot;, is the presiding teacher of the Science Club.
* Principal Amanda Durst (portrayed by Valerie Boyle) is the disagreeable Principal Durst is a looming presence over the Science Club, and differs with Professor Zachary&#x27;s easygoing ways. A former science teacher, she is a reluctant conspirator in Victor Pearson&#x27;s plans.
* Victor Pearson (portrayed by Lawrence Bayne) is a benefactor of the school and a constant antagonist to the Science Club&#x27;s investigations.
* The Janitor (portrayed by Tony Munch) is an enigmatic character who seems to understand the mysteries at Blake Holsey High.

==Significant objects and locations==
*Qigong Ball/Chi Ball/Floating Ball: Once a normal ball used to handle stress, but became a source of unlimited potential. Josie had used these balls for relaxation, but during Science Club, one was taken from her by Professor Zachary. The other one was affected by the energy of the wormhole in a trip to the 1970s, which made it gravity-less. It defies the laws of physics, which was why a younger Victor Pearson steals it from Josie years ago when he was in Blake Holsey High. Presenting it to Sarah Lynch, they started their plan to create Pearadyne Industries. Using the Chi Ball to power their lab, it caused an explosion, which led to the destruction of Pearadyne and Sarah&#x27;s disappearance. Consequently, a wormhole formed at Blake Holsey and caused other strange occurrences. When Josie finds the ball again, she assumes that Vaughn and Victor had plotted to use it. Josie steals it back from them and replaces it with the Chi Ball&#x27;s original normal partner, leaving Victor under the impression that the Chi Ball has somehow lost its power. However, Josie&#x27;s clone from the future steals the floating ball back and places it back into Victor&#x27;s hands.
* Wormhole: A powerful vortex that can lead to either the future or the past that can be found in the office of Blake Holsey&#x27;s science teacher. The exact time and duration the wormhole is open is apparently sporadic and it is uncertain when it will lead. Many agents have attempted to keep the knowledge of the wormhole a secret from everyone, however the energy released from the wormhole has affected the students and the school due to the emotions and conditions of the students.
* Pearadyne Industries/Labs: A laboratory created by Victor Pearson and Sarah Lynch. It was used to create inventions and master quantum physics. On October 4, 1987, Pearadyne was destroyed in an explosion that covered the disappearance of many workers, including Sarah Lynch (Vaughn&#x27;s mother).

<doc id="1242956" wikidata="Q6803767" url="?curid=1242956" title="Gross national income">
<text>The gross national income (GNI), previously known as gross national product (GNP), is the total amount of factor incomes earned by the residents of a country. It is equal to gross domestic product (GDP), plus factor incomes received from non-resident by residents, minus factor income paid by residents to non-resident.

In contrast to GDP, GNI is not a concept of value added, but a concept of income. GNI is the basis of calculation of the largest part of contributions to the Budget of the European Union. In February 2017, Ireland&#x27;s GDP became so distorted from the base erosion and profit shifting (&quot;BEPS&quot;) tax planning tools of U.S. multinationals, that the Central Bank of Ireland replaced Irish GDP with a new metric, Irish Modified GNI (or &quot;GNI*&quot;). In 2017, Irish GDP was 162% of Irish Modified GNI.

GNI contrast with net national income : NNI = GNI - Depreciation

The Atlas method can be applied to correct for fluctuating exchange rates.

== History and name change ==
The modern concept of GNP, along with GDP, was first developed by Simon Kuznets for a 1934 U.S. Congress report. Countries like the US and the UK originally preferred GNP as a measure of economic activity while other like Norway preferred GDP. Overtime communication harmonize around GDP included in the US which switched in 1991.

GNP was defined in the 1953 SNA as :

&quot;the market value of product before deduction of provisions of consumption of fixed capital, attributable to factors of production supplied by normal residents of the given country&quot;

Despite framing GNP as concept of production, the attribution of the value was defined by the income earned by owner of the factor of production.

In the 1993 revision to the SNA, GNP definition was reframed from the point of view of the residents receiving income rather than the point of view of the factor of production. To reflect this, GNP was renamed GNI; the &quot;national&quot; part was keep as it is embedded in economic usage, even though the same concept of residence is used to defined both GDP and GNI.

GNP continue to be uses in the National income and product accounts to referd to GNI calculated for expenditure data.

== Type of income included in GNI ==
GNI include the salaries and wages of cross-border commuters and seasonal workers working overseas but do not include remittance sent by workers to their families overseas. This explains why France GNI is higher than its GDP as a lot of French residents work in Luxembourg, Monaco or Switzerland; while India GNI is lower than its GDP despite being the larger receiver of remittances.

GNI also includes the propriety income: rent, interest and &quot;profit&quot;. The &quot;profit&quot; included both distributed income of corporations (dividends) and reinvested earnings on foreign direct investment, those are profit retained by the corporation. Like in the IMF balance of payments manual they are treated as if they were distributed to foreign direct investors in proportion to their ownership of the equity of the enterprise and then reinvested by them by means of additions in equity.

The GNI of EU countries also included subsidies received from the EU and excluded tariffs as those are received by EU.

GNI contrasts with Gross national disposable income which includes all current transfer income like international cooperation and remittance.

==Gross national product ==

Gross national product (GNP) is the market value of all the goods and services produced in one year by labor and property supplied by the citizens of a country. Unlike gross domestic product (GDP), which defines production based on the geographical location of production, GNP indicates allocated production based on location of ownership. In fact it calculates income by the location of ownership and residence, and so its name is also the less ambiguous &quot;gross national income&quot;.

GNP is an economic statistic that is equal to GDP plus any income earned by residents from overseas investments minus income earned within the domestic economy by residents.

GNP does not distinguish between qualitative improvements in the state of the technical arts (e.g., increasing computer processing speeds), and quantitative increases in goods (e.g., number of computers produced), and considers both to be forms of &quot;economic growth&quot;.

When a country&#x27;s capital or labour resources are employed outside its borders, or when a foreign firm is operating in its territory, GDP and GNP can produce different measures of total output. In 2009 for instance, the United States estimated its GDP at $14.119 trillion, and its GNP at $14.265 trillion.

The term &quot;gross national income&quot; (GNI) has gradually replaced the &quot;Gross national product&quot; (GNP) in international statistics. While being conceptually identical, the precise calculation method has evolved at the same time as the name change.

===Use of GNP===
The United States used GNP as its primary measure of total economic activity until 1991, when it began to use GDP. In making the switch, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) noted both that GDP provided an easier comparison of other measures of economic activity in the United States and that &quot;virtually all other countries have already adopted GDP as their primary measure of production&quot;. Many economists have questioned how meaningful GNP or GDP is as a measure of a nation&#x27;s economic well-being, as it does not count most unpaid work and counts much economic activity that is unproductive or actually destructive.

===GNI vs GDP===
While GDP measures the market value of all final goods and services produced in a given country, GNI measures income generated by the country&#x27;s citizens, regardless of the geographic location of the income. In many states, those two figures are close, as the difference between income received by the country versus payments made to the rest of the world is not significant. According to the World Bank, the GNI of the US in 2016 was 1.5% higher than GDP.

In developing countries, on the other hand, the difference might be significant due to a large amount of foreign aid and capital inflow. In 2016, the GNI of Armenia was 4.45% higher than GDP. Based on the OECD reports, in 2015 alone, Armenia has received a total of US$409 million development assistance. Over the past 25 years, USAID has provided more than one billion USD to improve the living of the people in Armenia. GNI equals GDP plus wages, salaries, and property income of the country&#x27;s residents earned abroad that also constitutes the higher GNI figure. According to the UN report on migration from Armenia in 2015–17, every year around 15–20 thousand people leave Armenia permanently, and roughly 47% of those are working migrants that leave the country to earn income and sustain the families left in Armenia. In 2016 Armenian residents received in a total of around $150 million remittances. Armenia&#x27;s GNI, measured in US dollars, amounted to US$13.5 billion in 2021, according to the National Statistical Office. This is an 8.23% increase over the prior year. GNI in USD terms in Armenia has historically ranged from a record high of US$13.8 billion in 2019 to a record low of US$1.06 billion in 1992. Regarding interest rates on GNI expressed in USD, Armenia is ranked 119th out of the 155 monitored nations.

<doc id="1242958" wikidata="Q7617471" url="?curid=1242958" title="Stinson 108">
<text>The Stinson 108 is a popular single-engine, four-seat, light general aviation aircraft produced by the Stinson division of the American airplane company Consolidated Vultee, from immediately after World War II to 1950 (by which time Stinson was a division of Piper Aircraft). The 108 was developed from the prewar Model 10A Voyager (also known as the &quot;Stinson 105&quot;).

First built in 1946 – as a stretched derivative of the Model 10A / 105 Voyager – more than 5,000 of the model 108 Voyager (or Station Wagon) were produced by Stinson, before the company was acquired by Piper Aircraft in late 1948. 

When Piper took over the 108 line, a number of model 108s built by Stinson were completed, but unsold, and went to Piper as part of the acquisition. Piper then sold that inventory as the Piper-Stinson over the next few years. Some reports appear to indicate that 108 production and/or sales continued under Piper until 1949, 1950 or 1951.

In all, 5,260 Stinson (or Piper-Stinson) 108s were reportedly built Most models were named &quot;Voyager&quot; (like the preceding 10A/105), but some were named &quot;Station Wagon,&quot; reflecting interior modifications to accommodate cargo.

==Design and development==
The single-engine, four-seat, fixed-gear, high-wing, Stinson 108 series was built with a six-cylinder Franklin engine -- 6A4-150, or 6A4-165, normally -- driving a fixed-pitch propeller.

The fuselage is of fabric-covered steel tube. Aftermarket modifiers have obtained supplemental type certificates (STC) allowing conversion to an aluminum covering. Many different engines have been installed in the 108 by STC such as the Lycoming O-360, Franklin O-350, Continental O-470.

One distinctive feature is the partial leading edge slot installed on the wings and aligned with the ailerons on the trailing edge, ensuring that the portion of the wing containing the aileron remains unstalled at higher angles of attack, thus contributing to docile stall behavior.

The 108 initially proved popular, with 746 examples built in 1946, while production in 1947 was almost half of all 4-seat private aircraft built in the United States, with the Stinson division the only part of Convair that was profitable for a time. 

In 1948, however, overproduction in the US general aviation industry led to a glut of light aircraft, with unsold 108s being stored, and on 30 June 1948, Convair shut down the Stinson factory. The name and assets of Stinson (including 200 unsold 108s) were sold to Piper Aircraft on 1 December 1948, with Piper setting up a Stinson division in April 1949 to sell the complete aircraft inherited from Convair, and to assemble a further 125 aircraft from spare parts. These aircraft were marketed as Piper-Stinson 108s.

Total new production of the Stinson Model 108, by Stinson, was 5,260; this total does not include the two converted prototypes. Stinson delivered approximately 4,935 aircraft and Piper delivered approximately 325 aircraft. Piper later sold the type certificate to Univair Aircraft Corporation. Univair built and certified the model 108-5, but built only one example. Total new model production by Stinson and Univair was 5,261 aircraft.

==Variants==
The 108 variants closely resemble each other but can be visually distinguished by their design changes:
;Prototype 108
:Two prototype model 108s were converted from Stinson model 10A airframes. FAA records show NX31519 was model 108 serial number 1, and NX31532 is model 108 serial number 2. Both registrations later changed to NC. The production model straight 108 would also use serial number 1 and 2, so there was for a short period 2 duplicate serial numbers;
;108 Voyager 125
:Powered by a Lycoming O-235 piston engine.
;108 Voyager 150
:Powered by a Franklin 6A4-150-B31, B3 or B4 piston engine. 742 built in 1946.
;108-1
:Slightly modified version with external baggage door. 1508 built 1947–1948.
;108-2
:Powered by Franklin 6A4-165-B3 or -B5. 1250 built from May 1948. There was a conversion kit to add the rudder trim to the earlier airplanes advertised.

;108-3
:The 108-3 introduced a taller vertical fin with a rudder featuring a straight trailing edge. Larger fuel tanks ( versus ) were also fitted. The -3 has a higher gross weight than its predecessors of . 1760 built by Stinson and Piper.
;108-4
:The 108-4 is a higher powered model 108, sn 108-4693, NX149C, not certified, flown experimentally by Stinson, later by Piper, 1 built.
;Flying Station Wagon
:The &quot;Flying Station Wagon&quot; version was an option available with the -1, -2 and -3 models, had a utility interior incorporated wood panelling and a reinforced floor, allowing of baggage in the passenger compartment. The aircraft could be fitted with wheel, float or ski landing gear. The single 108-4 built was a Flying Station Wagon.
;108-5
:A single 108-5 was built by Univair, who purchased the Stinson 108 type certificate from Piper, in 1964. The 108-5 used a Franklin 6A-335-B1 engine. Univair offered kits to convert earlier aircraft to this standard. The 108-5 brought total model 108 production to 5,261, of which 5,135 were built by Stinson, 125 by Piper, and 1 by Univair.

==Operators==
*Spanish Air Force operated eighteen 108-3 aircraft, with the designation L.2.

<text>Frederick Traugott Pursh (or Friedrich Traugott Pursch) (February 4, 1774 – July 11, 1820) was a German–American botanist.

Born in Großenhain, in the Electorate of Saxony, under the name Friedrich Traugott Pursh, he was educated at Dresden Botanical Gardens, and emigrated to the United States in 1799. From 1802 to 1805, he worked in Philadelphia as the botanical manager of the extensive gardens of William Hamilton, Esq., &quot;The Woodlands.&quot; By 1805, he was working for Benjamin Smith Barton on a new flora of North America, under whom he studied the plants collected on the Lewis and Clark Expedition. His work with Barton allowed him to travel farther afield. In 1805, he traveled south from Maryland to the Carolinas and, in 1806, he traveled north from the mountains of Pennsylvania to New Hampshire. He made both trips principally on foot, with only his dog and a gun, covering over three thousand miles each season.

Barton&#x27;s proposed flora was never written, but Pursh, who then moved to London, England, did make a major contribution to North American botany in his &quot;; or A Systematic Arrangement and Description of The Plants of North America&quot; (variously dated as published in 1813 or 1814). He then returned to America, moving to Canada in 1816. He botanized a great deal in Quebec, but all the material he accumulated was destroyed by fire before it could be organized into suitable form for publication. His hopes of carrying out further major work were prevented by ill health due to alcoholism.

He was so destitute when he died in Montreal that his funeral expenses had to be defrayed by his friends. His remains lay in the Papineau Road cemetery until 1857, when they were moved to the Mount Royal Cemetery. A proper monument was paid for by subscription. It read as follows:

:Frederick Pursh,
:Obt. 1820, AEt. 46. 
:Erected
:By Members of the 
:Natural History Society
:of Montreal
:1878.

His name is commemorated in the genus &quot;Purshia&quot; (bitterbush) and in several species, e.g. &quot;Rhamnus purshiana&quot;.

<text>Désirée Cousteau (born 1956 or 1957) is a pornographic actress and striptease artist who was active in the late 1970s and early 1980s. She is best known for her role in the 1978 film &quot;Pretty Peaches&quot;.

==Career==

===Early career===

Cousteau aspired to model for &quot;Vogue&quot;, but was told she was not tall or thin enough. After a period modeling lingerie, she appeared in Jonathan Demme&#x27;s 1974 debut &quot;Caged Heat&quot; (also known as &quot;Renegade Girls&quot;). She also posed for &quot;Penthouse&quot;, appearing in the June 1974 issue as Deborah Clearbranch.

===Pornographic films===

Cousteau&#x27;s porn career began in 1978, when she did sex scenes in four films, initially with the hybrid stage name of Désirée Clearbranch, before taking a more substantial role in Bob Chinn&#x27;s &quot;Hot and Saucy Pizza Girls&quot;, in which she has three sex scenes and something of a narrative arc. &quot;Pizza Girls&quot; was followed a couple months later by Alex de Renzy&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Peaches&quot;, a film constructed entirely around Cousteau. It instantly established her as a porn star, a status confirmed when she won the Adult Film Association of America Best Actress Award for her performance the following year.

Other roles quickly followed, most trading on the dizzy naïf persona Cousteau created for &quot;Pretty Peaches&quot; (whose storyline was distantly derived from Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;). She made around twenty features and loops in 1979, as well as doing photo shoots for magazines such as &quot;Hustler&quot; and &quot;High Society&quot;. Cousteau&#x27;s 1979 credits include scenes in three movies by French director Gérard Kikoïne. One was in the ambitious French-American co-production &quot;Aphrodesia&#x27;s Diary&quot;, shot mostly in New York and not released until 1983, but the other two were shot in France (Cousteau&#x27;s dialogue was dubbed).

Cousteau announced her retirement from porn films in an interview for the TV series &quot;Midnight Blue&quot; at an event to promote &quot;Deep Rub&quot; in the latter part of 1979. She appears, however, to have undertaken a few projects after that date, with a handful of loops and features in 1980 and 1981. All later films purporting to involve Cousteau use archival footage.

Cinematographer David Jennings considered her psychologically unsuited for pornographic work. In her &quot;Midnight Blue&quot; interview, Cousteau says she prefers striptease, &quot;Because you&#x27;re on a stage and you never have physical contact with anyone. I never leave the stage. So there&#x27;s an isolation and a security there that I don&#x27;t feel with films.&quot;

===After pornography===

At the time of the &quot;Midnight Blue&quot; interview, Cousteau was appearing at the Melody Burlesk in New York, which regularly featured porn stars in addition to its house dancers. She performed a one-woman show consisting of dance and striptease followed by audience questions, which also included posing nude for photographs while seated on patrons&#x27; laps. By 1981, Cousteau was traveling for three weeks every month to perform at burlesque theaters. During a performance at the Parkway Theater in Milwaukee, Cousteau &quot;was covered with a coat and led off stage&quot; by police, but the district attorney&#x27;s office declined to prosecute. She later danced topless on New York cable television&#x27;s &quot;The Robin Byrd Show&quot; to promote her stage work. After more than a year of physically gruelling live performance and at least two brushes with the law, she appears to have quit the adult entertainment industry by the end of 1981.

Cousteau&#x27;s films remained staples of the shrinking X-rated cinema circuit in the 1980s and of cable television in the 1990s, as well as of X-rated home video. She was inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame in 1993, and into the AVN Hall of Fame in 1997.

<doc id="1242977" wikidata="Q900689" url="?curid=1242977" title="Flocculation">
<text>In colloidal chemistry, flocculation is a process by which colloidal particles come out of suspension to sediment in the form of floc or flake, either spontaneously or due to the addition of a clarifying agent. The action differs from precipitation in that, prior to flocculation, colloids are merely suspended, under the form of a stable dispersion (where the internal phase (solid) is dispersed throughout the external phase (fluid) through mechanical agitation) and are not truly dissolved in solution.

Coagulation and flocculation are important processes in fermentation and water treatment with coagulation aimed to destabilize and aggregate particles through chemical interactions between the coagulant and colloids, and flocculation to sediment the destabilized particles by causing their aggregation into floc.

== Term definition ==
According to the IUPAC definition, flocculation is &quot;a process of contact and adhesion whereby the particles of a dispersion form larger-size clusters&quot;. Flocculation is synonymous with agglomeration and coagulation/coalescence.

Basically, coagulation is a process of addition of coagulant to destabilize a stabilized charged particle. Meanwhile, flocculation is a technique that promotes agglomeration and assists in the settling of particles. The most common used coagulant is alum, Al2(SO4)3·14H2O.

The chemical reaction involved:

:Al2(SO4)3 · 14 H2O → 2 Al(OH)3 + 6 H+ + 3 + 8 H2O

During flocculation, gentle mixing accelerates the rate of particle collision, and the destabilized particles are further aggregated and enmeshed into larger precipitates. Flocculation is affected by several parameters, including mixing shear and intensity, time and pH. The product of the mixing intensity and mixing time is used to describe flocculation processes.

=== Jar test ===
The process by which the dosage and choice of flocculant are selected is called a jar test. The equipment used for jar testing consists of one or more beakers, each equipped with a paddle mixer. After the addition of flocculants, rapid mixing takes place, followed by slow mixing and later the sedimentation process. Samples can then be taken from the aqueous phase in each beaker. 

== Applications ==
=== Surface chemistry ===
In colloid chemistry, flocculation refers to the process by which fine particulates are caused to clump together into a floc. The floc may then float to the top of the liquid (creaming), settle to the bottom of the liquid (sedimentation), or be readily filtered from the liquid. Flocculation behavior of soil colloids is closely related to freshwater quality. High dispersibility of soil colloids not only directly causes turbidity of the surrounding water but it also induces eutrophication due to the adsorption of nutritional substances in rivers and lakes and even boats under the sea.

=== Physical chemistry ===
For emulsions, flocculation describes clustering of individual dispersed droplets together, whereby the individual droplets do not lose their identity. Flocculation is thus the initial step leading to further ageing of the emulsion (droplet coalescence and the ultimate separation of the phases). Flocculation is used in mineral dressing, but can be also used in the design of physical properties of food and pharmaceutical products. 

=== Medical diagnostics ===
In a medical laboratory, flocculation is the core principle used in various diagnostic tests, for example the rapid plasma reagin test.
=== Civil engineering/earth sciences ===
In civil engineering, and in the earth sciences, flocculation is a condition in which clays, polymers or other small charged particles become attached and form a fragile structure, a floc. In dispersed clay slurries,
flocculation occurs after mechanical agitation ceases and the dispersed clay platelets spontaneously form flocs because of attractions between negative face charges and positive edge charges.

=== Biology ===

Flocculation is used in biotechnology applications in conjunction with microfiltration to improve the efficiency of biological feeds. The addition of synthetic flocculants to the bioreactor can increase the average particle size making microfiltration more efficient. When flocculants are not added, cakes form and accumulate causing low cell viability. Positively charged flocculants work better than negatively charged ones since the cells are generally negatively charged.

=== Cheese industry ===
Flocculation is widely employed to measure the progress of curd formation in the initial stages of cheese making to determine how long the curds must set. The reaction involving the rennet micelles are modeled by Smoluchowski kinetics. During the renneting of milk the micelles can approach one another and flocculate, a process that involves hydrolysis of molecules and macropeptides.

Flocculation is also used during cheese wastewater treatment. Three different coagulants are mainly used:
* FeSO4 (iron(II) sulfate)
* Al2(SO4)3 (aluminium sulfate)
* FeCl3 (iron(III) chloride)

=== Brewing ===

In the brewing industry flocculation has a different meaning. It is a very important process in fermentation during the production of beer where cells form macroscopic flocs. These flocs cause the yeast to sediment or rise to the top of a fermentation at the end of the fermentation. Subsequently, the yeast can be collected (cropped) from the top (ale fermentation) or the bottom (lager fermentation) of the fermenter in order to be reused for the next fermentation.

Yeast flocculation is partially determined by the calcium concentration, often in the 50-100ppm range. Calcium salts can be added to cause flocculation, or the process can be reversed by removing calcium by adding phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate, adding excess sulfate to form insoluble calcium sulfate, or adding EDTA to chelate the calcium ions. While it appears similar to sedimentation in colloidal dispersions, the mechanisms are different.

=== Water treatment process ===

Flocculation and sedimentation are widely employed in the purification of drinking water as well as in sewage treatment, storm-water treatment and treatment of industrial wastewater streams. 
For drinking water, typical treatment processes consist of grates, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, granular filtration and disinfection. The coagulation and flocculation steps are similar, causing particles to aggregate and fall out of solution, but may use different chemicals or physical movement of water. A variety of salts may be added to adjust the pH and act as clarifying agents, depending on the water chemistry. These include sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminum sulfate, aluminum oxide, ferric sulfate, ferric chloride, sodium aluminate, with flocculant aids polyaluminum chloride, polyferric chloride. A variety of cationic, anionic, and non-ionic polymers are also used, typically with a molecular weight below 500,000. Polydiallyldimethyl ammonium chloride (polyDADMAC) and epiDMA (a copolymer of epichlorohydrin and dimethylamine) are common choices, though these can produce carcinogenic nitrosamines. Sand, powerdered activated carbon, and clay may also be used as nucleating agents; in some cases, these are re-used after extraction.

Biopolymers, especially, chitosan, are increasingly popular as environmentally friendly flocculants. Chitosan is not only biodegradable but also exhibits a unique ability to bind with a wide range of contaminants, including heavy metals and organic pollutants, effectively removing them from water sources. 

Flocculation provides promising results for removing fine particles and treating stormwater runoff from transportation construction projects, but are not used by most state departments of transportation in the U.S. This may be due to regulative restrictions or insufficient guidance for soil sampling requirements in light of changing soil characteristics. States that must achieve a numeric turbidity limit are more inclined to use flocculants to ensure the appropriate level of treatment.

== Deflocculation ==

Deflocculation is the opposite of flocculation, sometimes known as peptization. Sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) is a typical example. Usually, in higher pH ranges, in addition to low ionic strength of solutions and domination of monovalent metal cations, the colloidal particles can be dispersed.
The additive that prevents the colloids from forming flocs is called a deflocculant. For deflocculation imparted through electrostatic barriers, the efficacy of a deflocculant can be gauged in terms of zeta potential. According to the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Polymers deflocculation is &quot;&quot;&quot;a state or condition of a dispersion of a solid in a liquid in which each solid particle remains independent and unassociated with adjacent particles (much like emulsifier). A deflocculated suspension shows zero or very low yield value&quot;.

Deflocculation can be a problem in wastewater treatment plants, as it commonly causes problems with sludge settling and deterioration of the effluent quality.

<doc id="1242982" wikidata="Q7099673" url="?curid=1242982" title="Orange Monkey">
<text>Orange Monkey is an American experimental rock band from California. The band currently consists of Aukey, Crystal, Mc Ryan, Dave and a penguin named Hiyo (formerly known as The Mysterious Hiyo.) The music is kitsch, quirky and satirical, with choppy editing and obscure references to the Power Rangers, Kerri Strug, ITT Tech and Pokémon.

Aukey, MC Ryan and Hiyo formed Orange Monkey in 1994 with the debut performance of their song &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; (now referred to as &quot;OG Fungus Amongus&quot;) recorded live. Not much is known about the time between that recording and 1998, when Crystal joined the band and became romantically involved with Aukey. Coining the term &quot;The Last Free Band&quot; due to their reliance on donations and refusal to charge money for their music (at the time), their debut release, &quot;Turtles In Love&quot;, was a barely navigable melange of genres, including electronica, funk, hip-hop and thrashcore. In between each of the songs was a sample from a Barney the Dinosaur Speak &amp; Spell-type toy which spelled out &quot;ORANGE MONKEY&quot;. The album also featured a reworking of &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; (referred to early on as the Tinactin Mix) as well as &quot;Joey VS Frog&quot;, dedicated to a fan who donated the CD burner that was used to produce the album.

The second release, &quot;Help Us Buy Mp3.com A Taco!&quot;, was an exclusive CD (now unavailable) made for MP3.com, containing old favourites as well as two new tracks, &quot;TJ Tech&quot; and &quot;(Unrecognizable Song)&quot;, which was dedicated to another fan after he had a dream about the band performing at a retirement home. Live performances were quite sporadic, usually in and around the area of Los Angeles. More tracks were released, appearing on various sites such as the IUMA and MP3.com. Special, personalized CDs were given out to various fans who were closest to the band. It is reasonable to suggest that this was the precursor to the release of &quot;Cheap Shot Beefcake&quot;, an exclusive CD (now unavailable) made for Rolling Stone Magazine&#x27;s site. Like &quot;HUBMAT!&quot;, this release featured many old tracks as well as several, recently recorded tracks. In 2001 for more than three months (August - November) Orange Monkey held the number one spot on Rolling Stone Magazines Unsigned Artist charts with their hit single &quot;Britney Spears Vs. Trojan Man&quot;.

After briefly changing the band name to Orange Monkey.net and hiring (and firing) new band members Dave and David, &quot;Phat Berries&quot; was released. The album contained very focused songwriting, relatively new effects and less of the satirical value that &quot;Turtles In Love&quot; embodied. The band&#x27;s playful exuberance and signature sound remained intact, despite sounding slightly more glam rock and doo-wop-oriented. At least for one show was performed on the sidewalk in front of artist Levon Jihanians exhibit opening in Glendale, powered by Mc Ryans (running) car and using the headlights for lighting. The band continued to tour around California, performing in and losing at various Battle Of The Bands competitions.

A third full-length album, &quot;ONKA&quot; (short for &quot;Our Next Krappy Album&quot;) was released early 2006.

<doc id="1242991" wikidata="Q5129818" url="?curid=1242991" title="Clay–water interaction">
<text>Clay-water interaction is an all-inclusive term to describe various progressive interactions between clay minerals and water. In the dry state, clay packets exist in face-to-face stacks like a deck of playing cards, but clay packets begin to change when exposed to water. Five descriptive terms describe the progressive interactions in a clay-water system.

(1) Hydration occurs as clay packets absorb water and swell.

(2) Dispersion (or disaggregation) causes clay platelets to break apart and disperse into the water due to the loss of attractive forces as water moves the platelets further apart.

(3) Flocculation begins when mechanical shearing stops, and platelets previously dispersed come together due to the attractive force of surface charges on the platelets.

(4) Deflocculation, or peptization, the opposite effect, occurs when a chemical de-flocculant is added to flocculated mud; the positive edge charges are covered, and attraction forces are greatly reduced.

(5) Aggregation, a result of ionic or thermal conditions, alters the hydrational layer around clay platelets, removes the deflocculant from positive edge charges, and allows platelets to assume a face-to-face structure.

<doc id="1242993" wikidata="Q179431" url="?curid=1242993" title="Road Town">
<text>Road Town, located on Tortola, is the capital and largest town of the British Virgin Islands. It is situated on the horseshoe-shaped Road Harbour in the centre of the island&#x27;s south coast. The population was about 15,000 in 2018.

The name is derived from the nautical term &quot;the roads&quot;, a place less sheltered than a harbour but which ships can easily get to. A development called Wickham&#x27;s Cay, consisting of two areas that were reclaimed from the sea and a marina, have enabled Road Town to emerge as a haven for yacht chartering and a centre of tourism. This area is the newest part of the city and the hub for the new commercial and administrative buildings of the BVI. The oldest building in Road Town, HM Prison on Main Street, was built in 1774.

==Climate==
The British Virgin Islands enjoy a tropical climate, moderated by trade winds. Temperatures vary little throughout the year. In the capital, Road Town, typical daily maxima are around in the summer and in the winter. Typical daily minima are around in the summer and in the winter. Rainfall averages about per year, higher in the hills and lower on the coast. Rainfall can be quite variable, but the wettest months on average are September to November and the driest months on average are February and March. Hurricanes occasionally hit the islands, with the hurricane season running from June to November.

==Transportation and tourism==
Road Town is one of the principal centres for bareboating (self-hire yacht chartering) in the Caribbean. Many successful yacht-charter businesses operate from Road Town. Cruise ships can be often seen docked here as well.

The Harbour is a popular jumping-off point for many of the ferries servicing the island. The ferry terminal is located at the north-west end of Road Town. Ferries run during the day every day of the week, but rarely at night: it is important to consult an up-to-date ferry timetable in advance.

Road Town is served by the British Virgin Islands&#x27; only major airport, Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport (IATA: EIS, ICAO: TUPJ), at Beef Island, within a short drive of the city. Only short haul flights are available from this airport, long-distance flights are served by Cyril E. King Airport in the US Virgin Islands (IATA: STT ICAO: TIST).

&quot;Buses&quot; in Tortola refers to full-sized passenger vans or large modified open-air pick-up trucks with bench seating and a canvas top: these are known locally as &quot;safaris&quot;. Traveling by bus can be less expensive than having a taxi to oneself, and is often an option when travelling from the airport to Road Town, or from town to either end of the island.

==History==

On 1 August 1834, the Slavery Abolition Act was read at the Sunday Morning Well.

In 1853, a town-wide fire destroyed nearly every building in Road Town. The fire spread because of angry rioters who protested an increase on the cattle tax. Rioters eventually set fire to most of the plantations across the island.

On September 4, 2017, the most intense tropical cyclone to hit the British Virgin Islands, Hurricane Irma, hit and devastated the islands leaving behind multiple casualties .

==Geographical limits==
There is some ambiguity as to the precise geographical extent of Road Town. Approaching the town from the west, a sign at the bottom of Slaney Hill greets visitors to Road Town. But traditionalists assert that the town itself only starts from Road Reef and Fort Burt, and that Prospect Reef Hotel (which covers almost all the land in between) is not technically in Road Town.

Approaching Road Town from the east, there is similar ambiguity if Road Town begins at the Port Purcell roundabout below Fort George, or whether it also includes Baughers&#x27; Bay.

Fort Burt and Fort George were the historical markers of the western and eastern limits of the town which benefitted from the protection of the Crown.

<doc id="1242998" wikidata="Q2724015" url="?curid=1242998" title="History of Detroit">
<text>Detroit, the largest city in the state of Michigan, was settled in 1701 by French colonists. It is the first European settlement above tidewater in North America. Founded as a New France fur trading post, it began to expand during the 19th century with U.S. settlement around the Great Lakes. By 1920, based on the booming auto industry and immigration, it became a world-class industrial powerhouse and the fourth-largest city in the United States. It held that standing through the mid-20th century.

The first Europeans to settle in Detroit were French country traders and colonists from the New Orleans (the La Louisiane) colony. They were joined by traders from Montreal and Quebec; all had to contend with the powerful Five Nations of the League of the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee), who took control of the southern shores of Lakes Erie and Huron through the Beaver Wars of the 17th century. Also present and powerful, but further to the north, were the Council of Three Fires (Anishinaabe). (in Anishinaabe: Niswi-mishkodewinan, also known as the People of the Three Fires; the Three Fires Confederacy; or the United Nations of Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi Indians) is a long-standing Anishinaabe alliance of the Ojibwe (or Chippewa), Odawa (or Ottawa), and Potawatomi North American Native tribes. The Three Fires Confederacy (Anishinaabe) were often supported by the French, while the so-called League of Iroquois, or Five Nations (Haudenosaunee) was supported by the English and Dutch. 

Immigration grew initially for the lucrative inland and Great Lakes connected fur trade, based on continuing relations with influential Native American chiefs and interpreters. The Crown&#x27;s administration of New France offered free land to colonists to attract families to the region of Detroit. The population grew steadily, but more slowly than in the English private venture-funded Thirteen Colonies based on the Atlantic coast. The French had a smaller population base and attracted fewer families. During the French and Indian War (1756–1763), the French reinforced and improved Fort Detroit (which had been constructed in 1701) along the Detroit River between 1758 and 1760. It was subject to repeated attacks by British and colonial forces combined with their Indian allies. 
Fort Detroit was surrendered to the British on November 29, 1760, after the fall of Quebec. Control of the area, and all French territory east of the Mississippi River, were formally transferred to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris after the British defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War. The official census counted 2,000 people in Detroit in 1760, which dropped to 1,400 by 1773 due to the unattractiveness of living in the fledgling settlement. The city was in territory which the British restricted the colonists from settling in under Royal Proclamation of 1763. It was transferred to Quebec under the Quebec Act of 1774. By 1778 in a census taken during the American Revolution, population was up to 2,144. It was then the third-largest city in the Province of Quebec, after Montreal and Quebec.

After 1773 a steady but growing trickle of European-American settlers took families across the barrier range, or through lower New York State into the Ohio Country—gradually spreading across present-day Ohio along the south shore of Lake Erie and around the bottom of Lake Huron. After the 1778 Sullivan Expedition broke the power of the Iroquois, the New York corridor joined the gaps of the Allegheny, Cumberland Narrows and Cumberland Gap as mountain passes, enabling settlers to pour west into the mid-west, even as the American Revolution wound down.

After the peace, a flood of settlers continued west, and Detroit reaped its share of population, established itself as a gateway to the west and the Great Lakes, and for a time outshone all other cities west of the mountains, save for New Orleans.

During the 19th century, Detroit grew into a thriving hub of commerce and industry. After a devastating fire in 1805, Augustus B. Woodward devised a street plan similar to Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s design for Washington, D.C. Monumental avenues and traffic circles were planned to fan out in radial fashion from Campus Martius Park in the heart of the city. This was intended to ease traffic patterns and trees were planted along the boulevards and .

The city expanded along Jefferson Avenue, with multiple manufacturing firms taking advantage of the transportation resources afforded by the river and a parallel rail line. In the late 19th century several Gilded Age mansions were built just east of Detroit&#x27;s current downtown. Detroit was referred to by some as the &quot;Paris of the West&quot; for its architecture, and for Washington Boulevard, recently electrified by Thomas Edison. Throughout the 20th century, various skyscrapers were built centered on Detroit&#x27;s downtown.

Following World War II, the auto industry boomed and suburban expansion took place. The Detroit metropolitan area developed as one of the larger geographic areas of the United States. Immigrants and migrants have contributed significantly to Detroit&#x27;s economy and culture. Later in the century, industrial restructuring and trouble in the auto industry led to a dramatic decline in jobs and population. Since the 1990s, the city has gained increased revitalization. Many areas of the city are listed in the National Register of Historic Places and include National Historic Landmarks.

==Native American history==

Hearths and geological features from the Holcombe beach site near Lake Saint Clair show that Paleo-Indian people settled in the area of Detroit as early as 11,000 years ago. Mound Builders lived in the area, the largest mound in the area was The Great Mound of the River Rouge, as well as and Springwells and the Fort Wayne Mound Site. Cone-shaped mounds were built for burial, ceremonial, and defense purposes. The large mound at River Rouge was found to have had very old human bones, arrow heads, chisels, axels, and pottery. The Mound Builders were ancestors to later Native American tribes.

In the 17th century, the region was inhabited by the Huron, Odawa, Potawatomi and western nations of the Iroquois League. The first Europeans did not penetrate into the region and reach the straits of Detroit until French missionaries and traders worked their way around the Iroquois, with whom they were at war in the 1630s. In the late 1600s, raids led by the Five Nations of the Iroquois throughout the region drove out competing native peoples in order to control the fur trade. The French found their permanent villages to be abandoned when they decided to build a fort on the northern bank of the Detroit River.

==Early French settlement==

The first recorded mention of the site was in the 1670s, when French missionaries found a stone idol venerated by the Native Americans there and destroyed it with an axe. Early settlers planted twelve missionary pear trees &quot;named for the twelve Apostles&quot; on the grounds of what is now Waterworks Park.

The city name comes from the Detroit River ({{langx|fr|le détroit du Lac Érie}}), meaning &quot;the strait of Lake Erie&quot;, linking Lake Huron and Lake Erie; in the historical context, the strait included Lake St. Clair and the St. Clair River.
The sieur de Cadillac in 1698 proposed to his government in Paris that Detroit be established as a shelter for displaced Native American allies. Paris approved and in 1701, Cadillac with his lieutenant Alphonse de Tonty, led a party of 100 Frenchmen to establish a post called &quot;Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit&quot;, naming it after his sponsor the comte de Pontchartrain, Minister of Marine under Louis XIV. In 1704, he was given ownership over the strenuous opposition of officials in New France. An investigation by de Pontchartrain showed Cadillac was a tyrannical profiteer whose mischief hurt the French cause, so Cadillac was removed and sent to faraway New Orleans as governor of Louisiana.

Ste. Anne de Détroit, founded 1701, is the second oldest continuously operating Catholic parish in the United States; it was the first building erected in Detroit.

The main business was trading furs with the Native Americans, using goods supplied from Montreal. It was the largest French village between Montreal and New Orleans. Native American villages of rival tribes grew up near the fort which lead to the Fox Wars in the early 1700s.

François-Marie Picoté de Belestre, the last French commander at Fort Detroit (1758–1760), surrendered on November 29, 1760, to the British. Control of the area was formally transferred to the British by the 1763 Treaty of Paris. New France was renamed Quebec and the settlement became &quot;Detroit&quot;. Grants of free land attracted families to Detroit, which grew to 800 people in 1765.

Demonstrating their independent power, several tribes in the region collaborated in Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion in 1763; they overran many smaller forts but could not subdue Detroit.

==Early American control==
Detroit was the goal of various American campaigns during the Revolutionary War, but logistical difficulties in the American frontier and American Indian allies of Great Britain would keep any armed Patriot force from reaching the Detroit area. In the 1783 Treaty of Paris, Great Britain ceded territory that included Detroit to the newly recognized United States, though in reality it remained under British control. Great Britain continued to trade with and defend her native allies in the area, and supplied local nations with weapons and supplies to raid American settlers and soldiers. The British left in 1796 following the Jay Treaty. In 1794, a Native American alliance, that had received some support and encouragement from the British, was decisively defeated by General Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers near Toledo, Ohio. Wayne negotiated the Treaty of Greenville (1795) with many of these nations, in which tribes ceded the area of Fort Detroit to the United States.

Father Gabriel Richard arrived at Ste. Anne&#x27;s in 1796. He helped start the school which evolved into the University of Michigan, started primary schools for American boys and girls as well as for Native Americans, as a territorial representative to U.S. Congress helped establish a road-building project that connected Detroit and Chicago, and brought the first printing press to Michigan which printed the first Michigan newspaper. The Great Fire of 1805 destroyed most of the settlement. A river warehouse and brick chimneys of the wooden homes were the sole structures to survive. Detroit&#x27;s motto and seal (as on the Flag) reflect this fire.

===First incorporation===
Detroit was incorporated as a town by the legislature of the Northwest Territory at Chillicothe, Ohio, on January 18, 1802, effective February 1, 1802. Government was administered by a five-person board of trustees and there was no office of mayor. Following this, Ohio became a state and the eastern half of Michigan was attached to the Indiana Territory.

===Woodward plan===

Before the new territorial government officially began, a fire destroyed nearly all of Detroit on June 11, 1805. The Michigan Territory was established effective June 30, 1805, as a separate territory with Detroit as the capital. The newly appointed governor, William Hull, and the territorial judges (Augustus B. Woodward, Frederick Bates, James Witherell, and John Griffin), constituted the territorial government. They convinced the U.S. Congress to pass an act on April 21, 1806, which authorized them to lay out a town that included all of the old town of Detroit plus an additional 10,000 acres (40 km2) to be used as compensation for persons who lost their house in the fire.
After the fire of 1805, Justice Augustus B. Woodward devised a plan similar to Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s design for Washington, D.C. Detroit&#x27;s monumental avenues and traffic circles fan out in a baroque styled radial fashion from Grand Circus Park in the heart of the city&#x27;s theater district, which facilitates traffic patterns along the city&#x27;s tree-lined boulevards and . Main thoroughfares radiate outward from the city center like spokes in a wheel.

===City incorporation===

On September 13, 1806, the territorial government passed an act incorporating the new city of Detroit. The governor appointed Solomon Sibley as mayor. Shortly afterward, Sibley resigned and Elijah Brush was appointed in his stead. The mayor was appointed by the governor and, under the act of incorporation, was able to disapprove legislation passed by the popularly elected council without any recourse for overriding the mayor. Because of this, many felt that the real aim of the governor in incorporating the city was to remove the popularly elected town officers and exert a more direct influence over governance of the city. This form of government was extremely unpopular, and was repealed on February 4, 1809. However, to prevent resurrection of the popularly elected town government, on September 16, 1810, an act passed repealing all laws pertaining to Michigan that had been passed by the Legislature of the Northwest Territory. This effectively eradicated any trace of legitimacy for the former popularly elected town government.

===War of 1812===
In the War of 1812, Governor Hull surrendered Detroit to a smaller British force supported by a larger force of Native American allies commanded by Tecumseh. The British commander, Isaac Brock, had bluffed the Americans into believing there were thousands of Native American warriors accompanying him. Tecumseh marched his native troops through a clearing and then circled the same troops through the clearing again to make it seem there was a much larger native force. Hull was convicted of cowardice and sentenced to death by a court martial, but received a presidential pardon. The U.S. Army recaptured Detroit in 1813 after the British abandoned it and used it as a base to invade Canada and permanently end the threat of Native American raids on American settlements. After the British abandoned Detroit, American forces caught up to the retreating British-Indian force, and decisively defeated them. Lewis Cass, as territorial governor, on October 24, 1815, restored control of local affairs to the people of Detroit, with the election of a five-person board of trustees and enactment of a charter for the city of Detroit.

==Slavery in early Detroit==
{{further|Slavery in New France}}
In the city&#x27;s earliest years, slavery was practiced in Detroit. While Detroit and the North in general are often assumed to have always been abolitionist and free of slavery, slavery played a role in the history of Detroit. Captive indigenous and African slaves contributed to the early development of the city. It is likely that slaves were among the first group that Cadillac brought to settle Detroit in 1701 and that their labor was used to plant the first crops. Slave labor was crucial for the city&#x27;s construction, black slaves provided the labor for the fur trade, and indigenous women were exploited for sex.

From Detroit&#x27;s establishment to Michigan&#x27;s gain of statehood, the ownership of slaves was dynamic. Slaveholders included merchants, farmers, political leaders, priests, and others who held power within the society.

Partly due to inadequate documentation, the history of slavery in Detroit is mysterious. There is nearly no record of the direct words of Detroit slaves, but there are few surviving records of slavery in the journals, wills, and finance accounts of slaveholders. Few scholarly works have been written about the role slavery played in Detroit, and Michigan has not produced any full-length narratives of slavery.

==A city emerges==

Government under the board of trustees continued until an act of the Territorial Legislature on August 5, 1824, created a Common Council of the City of Detroit. The Council consisted of five aldermen, the mayor, and the recorder. In an act of April 4, 1827, the number of aldermen increased to seven. In 1839, it increased to 14: two aldermen from six wards plus the mayor and recorder. A seventh ward was created in 1848, an eighth in 1849, and the ninth and tenth wards in 1857. Also in 1857, a new city charter provided that the mayor and recorder would no longer sit as members of the council. At this time, the council consisted of 20 members, two aldermen from ten wards. In 1873, a twelfth ward was added and aldermen from an illegally constituted eleventh ward also temporarily sat on the council. In 1875, a properly constituted eleventh ward and a thirteenth ward were added. The city charter of 1883 changed the name of the body to the Board of Aldermen. A few years earlier in 1881, a separately elected ten-person body named Board of Councilmen (also called the City Council), was established. This body was abolished in 1887.

After Detroit rebuilt in the early 19th century, a thriving community soon sprang up, and by the Civil War, over 45,000 people were living in the city, primarily spread along Jefferson Avenue to the east and Fort Street to the west. As in many major American cities, subsequent redevelopment of the central city through the next 150 years has eliminated all but a handful of the antebellum structures in Detroit. The oldest remaining structures are those built as private residences, including a group in the Corktown neighborhood and another set of houses strung along Jefferson Avenue—notably the Charles Trowbridge House (1826), (the oldest known structure in the city), the Joseph Campau House (1835), the Sibley House (1848), the Beaubien House (1851), and the Moross House (1855). Other extant pre-1860 structures include Fort Wayne (1849); Saints Peter and Paul Church (1848) and Mariner&#x27;s Church (1849); and early commercial buildings such as those in the Randolph Street Commercial Buildings Historic District, for example.

The main communication medium from the 1830s until the rise of television in the 1950s was the newspaper. Detroit had a large variety of daily papers, meeting the needs of the political parties have different language groups in the city, as well as the needs of readers concerned with news of business, labor, agriculture, literature, local churches, and polite society.

=== Civil War era ===
Prior to the American Civil War, the city&#x27;s access to the Canada–US border made it a key stop for runaway slaves along the Underground Railroad. The Michigan Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument in Detroit&#x27;s Campus Martius Park commemorates the state&#x27;s role in the American Civil War. Thousands of Detroiters formed volunteer regiments, including the 24th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment (part of the legendary Iron Brigade) which fought with distinction and suffered 82% casualties at Gettysburg in 1863. Abraham Lincoln is quoted as saying &quot;Thank God for Michigan!&quot; Following Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, General George Armstrong Custer delivered a eulogy to the thousands gathered near Campus Martius Park. Custer led the Michigan Brigade during the American Civil War and called them the &quot;Wolverines&quot;.

The Detroit race riot of 1863 occurred on March 6, 1863, and was the city&#x27;s first such incident, as Irish and German Catholics resisted the mandatory draft laws. At the time, it was reported as &quot;the bloodiest day that ever dawned upon Detroit&quot;. The casualties of the day included at least two people dead, and many others injured, mostly African-American, 35 buildings were burned to the ground, and a number of other buildings were damaged by fire.

===Rise of industry and commerce===


Detroit&#x27;s central location in the Great Lakes Region has contributed to its status as a major center for commerce and global trade. As Detroit grew, it emerged as a U.S. transportation hub linking the Great Lakes system of waterways to the Erie Canal and to rail lines. Pharmaceutical firms such as Parke-Davis in the 1870s and the Frederick Stearns Company in the 1890s established centers between East Jefferson Avenue. Globe Tobacco built a manufacturing facility closer to downtown in 1888. During the late 19th century, cast-iron stove manufacturing became Detroit&#x27;s top industry; by the 1890s, the city became known as the &quot;Stove Capital of the World&quot;.

The rise of manufacturing led to a new class of wealthy industrialists, entrepreneurs, and professionals. Some of these &quot;nouveau riche&quot; built along East Jefferson, resulting in structures such as the Thomas A. Parker House (1868), the Croul-Palms House (1881), the William H. Wells House (1889), the John N. Bagley House (1889), and the Frederick K. Stearns House (1902).

Detroit began increasingly to expand, and other citizens pushed north of downtown, building houses along Woodward in what was at the time a quiet residential area. The city has many restored historic Victorian structures, notably those in the Brush Park and East Ferry Avenue historic districts. The Elisha Taylor House (1870) and the Hudson–Evans House (1872) are both in Brush Park; the Col. Frank J. Hecker House (1888) and the Charles Lang Freer House (1887) are in the East Ferry Avenue neighborhood. Near the end of the 19th century, apartment living became more acceptable for affluent middle-class families, and upscale apartments, such as the Coronado Apartments (1894), the Verona Apartments (1894), the Palms Apartments (1903), the Davenport Apartments (1905) in the Cass-Davenport Historic District, and the Garden Court Apartments (1915) were constructed to meet the new demand.

These well-to-do late-19th-century residents also funded the construction of a spate of churches, such as the Cass Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church (1883), the First Presbyterian Church (1889), the Trinity Episcopal Church (1890) (built by James E. Scripps), and the First Unitarian Church (1890).

===Immigrants in the 19th century===

Detroit has long been a city of immigrants, from the early French settlers in the 17th and 18th century, through the Irish emigrants who settled in the Corktown neighborhood in the 1840s, and the Germans who comprised the largest group. Significant contingents during this period included German and Polish immigrants who settled in Detroit in the 1860-1890s.

Conditions were especially favorable for the Irish Catholics. Vinyard finds that they enjoyed many opportunities and suffered &quot;negligible religious prejudice&quot;. They were especially successful in politics, government service, dockyard and construction jobs, and built numerous churches. They funded the migration of relatives from Ireland. They took very active leadership roles in the Democratic Party and labor unions

European immigrants opened businesses and established communities. German immigrants established German-speaking churches, primarily on the east side of the city, including Saint John&#x27;s-St. Luke&#x27;s Evangelical Church (1872), St. Joseph Catholic Church (1873), and Sacred Heart Church (1875), as well as social clubs such as the Harmonie Club (1894) and west-side churches such as St. Boniface (1882) and Gethsemane Evangelical Lutheran Church (1891).


Close behind, a wave of Polish immigrants established east-side Roman Catholic parishes such as St. Albertus (1885), Sweetest Heart Of Mary (1893), St. Josaphat&#x27;s (1901), St. Stanislaus (1911), and St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church (1923). The Poles also settled on the west side, founding West Side Dom Polski (1916). The son of Prussian Polish immigrants, Rev. John A. Lemke, born in Detroit on February 10, 1866, was the first American-born Roman Catholic priest of Polish descent to be ordained in America. He was baptized at St. Mary Roman Catholic Church (1843), at the corner of St. Antoine and Croghan (Monroe), on February 18, 1866, attended St. Albertus for his primary education, and studied at Detroit College which is now the University of Detroit Mercy where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1884; then, after attending St. Mary&#x27;s in Baltimore, he completed his theological studies at St. Francis Seminary in Monroe, Michigan, and he was ordained by the Bishop John Samuel Foley in 1889. The Catholics were especially energetic in building churches, schools, orphanages, hospitals and other charitable institutions.

Nearly nine out of ten Detroiters in 1900 (87%) lived in single-family homes. European immigrants including German, Belgian, Polish, and Irish ethnics were likely to be home owners in the city. Most immigrants built their own home with the aid of their neighbors, or if still saving the purchase price they rented from fellow ethnics. They used an informal, localized, ethnically controlled housing market that was quite distinct from the professionally operated housing market. Homeownership in Detroit surged in the city&#x27;s immigrant neighborhoods by 1900.

=== Hazen Pingree ===
In 1887, John Pridgeon Jr., a Democrat, was elected mayor in a landslide after his Republican opponent endorsed prohibition in the heavily German city. Pridgeon&#x27;s term was besmirched by multiple scandals involving the Common Council, city commissioners, grand jury investigations, and multiple indictments for bribery and graft. In 1889, Republicans recouped and called for &quot;good government&quot; by nominating a businessman with no political experience, Hazen S. Pingree after a colorful campaign in which Pingree revealed his tolerance by making a circuit of saloons. One of his early projects was simply paving the streets—only four streets were paved, and &quot;The Detroit Journal&quot; described the rest as &quot;150 miles of rotting, rutted, lumpy, dilapidated paving&quot;. In hot weather some stretches oozed pitch and resin and occasionally caught fire from discarded cigar butts. Warning repeatedly against the dangers of government by the corporations, he launched nationally visible crusades against Detroit&#x27;s streetcar, gas, electric, and telephone companies. He successfully forced rate reductions that won him widespread popularity. He won public approval for a citizen-owned electric light plant, and became a national spokesman for municipal ownership and close regulation of utilities and street railways. When the nationwide Panic of 1893 pushed the nation into a deep depression (1893–97), he won approval by opening empty lots to garden farming – people called them &quot;Pingree&#x27;s potato patches&quot;. He was a steadfast Republican, and had nothing to do with the Populist Party that had considerable support among labor union members. Pingree added to the old stock Yankee Republican base by making large inroads into the German, Polish and Canadian elements. He was reelected in 1891, 1893 and 1895. Pingree was one of the most influential American mayors in the 1890s – historians now rated him number 4 among all American mayors, and see him as one of the early leaders of the Progressive Era. He supported the gold standard in 1896, and worked hard to carry the city and state for William McKinley over silverite William Jennings Bryan in the intensely competitive 1896 presidential election. McKinley carried the city and state and Pingree was elected governor of Michigan.

==20th century==

===Henry Ford and the automobile industry===
{{See also|History of Ford Motor Company|The Henry Ford}}

Henry Ford revolutionized the automobile industry when he virtually created the assembly line at his Highland Park Plant in 1910. His innovation transformed mass production and catalyzed Detroit&#x27;s growth and industrialization. Around the start of the 20th century, entrepreneurs in the Detroit area capitalized on the already-existing machine tool and coach-building industry in the city to forge into the production of automobiles. Detroit&#x27;s central geographic location and access to the Great Lakes and railways gave automobile producers easy access to capital and markets, making Detroit an ideal site for many automobile manufacturers&#x27; headquarters. As Ford&#x27;s rivals quickly adopted his manufacturing techniques, the automobile industry flourished and essentially elevated Detroit from a second-tier industrial city to a world-class city. Thus, Detroit earned its famous nickname, the Motor City.

At the turn of the 20th century, no one industry was dominant in Detroit. Early automotive production, which was still a relatively small industry at the time, is evidenced by structures such as the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant (1904) (a National Historic Landmark), and multiple structures in the surrounding Piquette Avenue Industrial Historic District (including the now-destroyed E-M-F/Studebaker Plant, 1906) and the New Amsterdam Historic District (including the original Cadillac factory, 1905) and small factories such as the Crescent Brass and Pin Company Building (1905). Then as automobile assembly and associated manufacturing came to dominate Detroit over the next thirty years, the newly minted automotive magnates built commercial and office buildings such as General Motors Building (1919), the General Motors Research Laboratory (1928), and the Fisher Building (1928).

In 1914, Ford revolutionized labor relations when he announced he would pay workers in his plants five dollars a day— about double the going rate at rival firms. In addition to attracting the best workers in Detroit, Ford&#x27;s high wage policy effectively stopped the massive turnover rate, raised productivity, lowered overall labor costs and helped to propel the Model T to industry dominance. By the 1920s, however, Ford&#x27;s formula of cheap cars with few options fell behind General Motors, which emphasized upscale quality and variety, and provided financing for car buyers. Labor relations in the automobile industry transformed again in 1935 when the United Auto Workers labor union was founded in Detroit.

The rapid growth of the automobile industry led to rising demands for labor. Immigrants from Europe initially filled much of the labor demand, but restrictive immigration acts in 1921 and 1924 caused a dramatic reduction in the supply of foreign-born workers to the United States. Meanwhile, the automobile industry was growing exponentially. Beginning during World War I, Ford began hiring African Americans to close the labor shortage. At this time, the hardships of life in the Jim Crow South and the promise of manufacturing jobs in the North brought African Americans to Detroit in large numbers in the Great Migration. This massive influx of workers and their families caused Detroit&#x27;s population to soar from 265,000 to 1.5 million between 1900 and 1930 and pushed the city&#x27;s boundaries outward. The population boom led to a severe housing shortage and the construction of public housing aimed at middle-class auto workers.

The rise of the automobile also required rethinking transportation within the city. The Chestnut Street-Grand Trunk Railroad bridge (1929) was a result of a grade separation that unsnarled train and automobile traffic. The Fort Street-Pleasant Street and Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Viaduct (1928) was a product of the same program, routing trucking traffic over the train traffic, and the West Jefferson Avenue-Rouge River Bridge (1922) allowed the Rouge River to be expanded for barge traffic.

===Progressive movement===

Progressivism was energized starting in the 1890s by upper-middle-class men and women who felt a civic duty to uplift society by &quot;freeing&quot; it from the tyranny of corrupt politicians who worked hand in hand with unscrupulous saloonkeepers. The most prominent leader was Republican Mayor Hazen S. Pingree. A representative community leader was automaker Henry M. Leland of the Detroit Citizens League. Supported by Detroit&#x27;s business, professional, and Protestant religious communities, the League campaigned for a new city charter, an anti-saloon ordinance, and the open shop whereby a worker could get a job even if he did not belong to a labor union.

Reinhold Niebuhr, a German-American Protestant minister became nationally famous as a Detroit minister who attacked the KKK, which was strong among white Protestants in the city. In an era when Henry Ford was an American icon, Niebuhr attracted national attention by criticizing the auto industry. He preached the Social Gospel, attacking what he considered the brutalization and insecurity of Ford workers. Niebuhr had moved to the left and was troubled by the demoralizing effects of industrialism on workers. He became an outspoken critic of Ford and allowed union organizers to use his pulpit to expound their message of workers&#x27; rights. Niebuhr attacked poor conditions created by the assembly lines and erratic employment practices.

Niebuhr rejected the prevailing optimism that prevailed in the 1920s. He wrote in his diary:

We went through one of the big automobile factories to-day ...The foundry interested me particularly. The heat was terrific. The men seemed weary. Here manual labor is a drudgery and toil is slavery. The men cannot possibly find any satisfaction in their work. They simply work to make a living. Their sweat and their dull pain are part of the price paid for the fine cars we all run. And most of us run the cars without knowing what price is being paid for them. ... We are all responsible. We all want the things which the factory produces and none of us is sensitive enough to care how much in human values the efficiency of the modern factory costs.

The historian Ronald H. Stone thinks that Niebuhr never talked to the assembly line workers (many of his parishioners were skilled craftsmen) but projected feelings onto them after discussions with Rev. Samuel Marquis. As some studies of assembly line workers have shown, the work may have been dull, but workers had complex motivations and could find ways to make meaning of their experiences; many boasted about their jobs and tried hard to place their sons on the assembly line. Ford tried but failed to control work habits.

Sociologists who interviewed workers concluded that they were more interested in controlling their home lives than their work lives. The Ford solution was welfare capitalism, paying relatively high wages with added benefits, such as vacations and retirement, that reduced turnover and appealed primarily to family men. Link and Link conclude that by tying half a man&#x27;s wages to the company&#x27;s profit, Ford managers offered &quot;a highly successful wage incentive plan that simultaneously increased job satisfaction and raised the productivity of labor&quot;.

At the beginning of the 20th century, historic Gilded Age areas such as Brush Park gave rise to even more upscale neighborhoods, including the Boston-Edison, Indian Village, and Palmer Woods. Woodward Avenue neighborhoods (such as the Warren-Prentis Historic District and the Willis-Selden Historic District) became mixed with apartments and commercial buildings. Many architecturally and historically significant churches and cathedrals arose during this period throughout the city&#x27;s neighborhoods.

Automobile wealth along with educational &amp; technological advancements led to a boom in downtown Detroit business, and the construction of a collection of early 20th century skyscrapers. The most notable of these are the Art Deco National Historic Landmark Guardian Building (1928) and The Fisher Building (1928). Many renowned architects including Albert Kahn, Wirt C. Rowland, and others designed and built a number of the cities skyscrapers and landmarks.

Shopping districts sprang up along Park Avenue, Broadway, and Woodward. In 1881, Joseph Lowthian Hudson opened a small men&#x27;s clothing store in Detroit. After 10 years he had 8 stores in the midwest and was the most profitable clothing retailer in the country. In 1893, he began construction of J. L. Hudson Department Store at Gratiot and Farmer streets in Detroit. The store grew over the years and a 25-story tower was added in 1928. The final section was a 12-story addition in 1946, giving the entire complex {{convert|49|acre|ha}} of floor space.

Multiple hotels were constructed, including the Fort Shelby Hotel (1916), the Detroit-Leland Hotel (1927), the Royal Palm Hotel (1924), and several others.

Extravagant movie palaces such as the Fox (1928) and the Palms (1925) entertained thousands every day. Public buildings, such as Orchestra Hall (1919), the Detroit Public Library (1921), and the Detroit Institute of Arts (1923) were inspired by the City Beautiful Movement.

===Immigrants in the 20th century===
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2020}}

The development of the automobile industry did more than create a significant increase in Detroit&#x27;s industrial production. It also changed the demographics of the city by attracting large waves of immigrants from Europe and Canada and black migrants from the South to fill the rising demands for labor. These people, who increased the city&#x27;s population during the early 1900s, did not just affect the expanding automobile industry; they also transformed neighborhoods by defining certain areas and bringing jobs and money into the local community. Although many people began to pile into Detroit, Thomas Sugrue, author of &quot;The Origins of the Urban Crisis&quot;, suggests, &quot;Beginning in the 1920s—and certainly by the 1940s—class and race became more important than ethnicity as a guide to the city&#x27;s residential geography.&quot;

An early wave of immigrants came from Greece in the late 1890s; it peaked from 1910 to 1914. These Greek peasants turned their understanding of supply and demand into thriving businesses as peddlers, grocers, and restaurateurs. Just as they lived in villages in Greece, so did they settle in a new &quot;village&quot; in Detroit known as Greektown. The Greek immigrants retained their native regionalism and factionalism by splitting their Detroit neighborhood into numerous sub-groups. With Americanization, however, the patriarchal culture diminished, although most families remained connected to the Greek Orthodox Church.

Like the Greeks, Italians began to settle in Detroit from 1890 to 1914. While most of these immigrants came from Europe and Canada, thereby blending in with the Caucasian residents already living in the city. Like American blacks, the Italian immigrants faced economic and social discrimination.

By 1914, Jews from Eastern Europe added to the already diverse demographics of Detroit. These new immigrants increased the established German Jewish community to about 34,000 people. Although the relationship between the wealthier, more Americanized German Jews and the poorer, less integrated immigrants tended to be a tense one, anti-Semitism was not an issue. Sugrue explains this by claiming, &quot;Residents of Detroit&#x27;s white neighborhoods abandoned their ethnic affiliations and found a new identity in their whiteness&quot; (Sugrue 22). Skin color, therefore, became more important than religious belief in the Americanization process.

African Americans—many of whom had migrated from the South to Detroit when jobs opened up during World War II—suffered the most. According to Sugrue, &quot;Black Detroit in 1940 was large and rapidly growing&quot; (Sugrue 23). The residents in Detroit&#x27;s sizable &quot;black ghetto&quot; often found themselves in dilapidated houses that served as homes for multiple families. African Americans, who were spatially segregated from whites, lived in overcrowded and poorly maintained places like Paradise Valley (Sugrue 23–4, 36). As the community changed, only a handful managed to relocate to the northern part of the city near the Eight Mile/Wyoming area; a selected few succeeded in finding homes in Conant Gardens. Wherever the location, black neighborhoods remained crowded, a result of the Great Migration of blacks to the city.

The rise in the black population mirrored the overall increase in the population of Detroit. Between 1900 and 1930, the number of people in the city grew from 265,000 to more than 1.5 million residents. Polish immigrants contributed to this population surge, becoming in the 1930s a large immigrant group totaling more than 66,000.

The Depression, followed by World War II, further diversified the city. Because political situations made it difficult to leave Europe during this time period, most of the new arrivals to Detroit came from within the United States: whites from Appalachia and blacks from the rural South. Sugrue notes that African Americans comprised more than a quarter of the city&#x27;s residents by 1960. After 1970, political tensions in the Middle East motivated Arabs, especially Palestinians, to also migrate to Detroit. These immigrants primarily relocated in Dearborn, an area that continues to remain an Arab center in the middle of Detroit.

Not only did Detroit increase in population during the twentieth century, but it also grew in geographic size. It expanded its borders exponentially by annexing all or part of the incorporated villages of Woodmere (1905), Delray (1905), Fairview (1907), St. Clair Heights (1918), and Warrendale (1925), as well as thousands of acres of land in the surrounding townships. Yet, areas such as Hamtramck and Highland Park maintained their status as legally separate cities within the larger metropolis of Detroit. 
Detroit, therefore, owes a great deal of its growth to the auto industry. The promise of jobs attracted immigrants from Europe, Asia, and the United States to settle in the Motor City. Originally defined by tightly knit ethnic clusters, the neighborhoods soon began to disperse. As Thomas Sugrue states, &quot;Fewer and fewer white neighborhoods were ethnically homogeneous.&quot; Although Detroit remains a large urban center today, it has lost much of its diversity to the suburbs. As a result, the remaining citizens of Detroit—primarily blacks—now face social and economic challenges that prevent them from enjoying lives of quality.

===Local politics===
Local politics from the 1870 to the 1910s had been influenced by prominent ethnic communities, especially German Americans and Irish Catholics who controlled the Democratic Party. This changed after 1910 as the old-stock Protestant business leaders, especially from the automobile industry, led a Progressive Era crusade for efficiency, and elected their own men to office, typified by James J. Couzens (mayor, 1919–1922, US Senator, 1922–1936). The critical change took place in 1918 when the voters changed the Common Council from a 42-man body elected on a partisan basis from 21 wards, to a nine-man unit, elected on a non-partisan basis from the city at-large. The ethnics (especially the Germans) and the Democrats lost their political base. After 1930, however, the Democratic party rebuilt its strength, formed an alliance with the United Auto Workers union and restored the leadership of the ethnics, as typified by Frank Murphy (mayor 1930–1933, governor 1937–1939). Mayors Jerome Cavanagh (1962–1970) and Roman Gribbs (1970–1974) were the last of the white ethnic mayors, until 2014. The election of Coleman Young (1974–1993) as mayor in 1974 brought to power a new generation of black leaders who represented the city&#x27;s new majority.

===Women in the 20th century===

Most young women took jobs before marriage, then quit. Before the growth of high schools after 1900, most women left school after the 8th grade at about age 15. Ciani (2005) shows that type of work they did reflected their ethnicity and marital status. Black mothers were often day labors, usually as domestic servants, because other opportunities were limited. Most mothers receiving pensions were white and sought work only when necessary.

Nursing became professionalized in the late 19th century, opening a new middle-class career for talented young women of all social backgrounds. The School of Nursing at Detroit&#x27;s Harper Hospital, begun in 1884, was a national leader. Its graduates worked at the hospital and also in institutions, public health services, as private duty nurses, and volunteered for duty at military hospitals during the Spanish–American War and the two world wars.

In the early 20th century, the middle-class women of the Detroit Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs&#x27; (DFWC) promoted civic mindedness within the context of traditional gender roles. Most of them were married to prominent business and professional leaders. Issues of public health, sanitation, and public safety were of vital concern to all families. The DFWC pressured city leaders to provide adequate education and sanitation facilities, safe food handling, and traffic safety. They did not form coalitions with working class or ethnic women, nor labor unions. A Women&#x27;s Citizens League was established and led by Lucia Voorhees Grimes.

World War II spurred the transition toward women holding a more active role in society. As more men enlisted, women were expected to take up their mantle in factories, defense industries and American businesses. In fact, an increasing number of women became their family&#x27;s main breadwinner; social campaigns like the famous &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; further reinforced the idea of an independent working women.

Despite these circumstances, the stereotypical image of women in society was hard-pressed to change. Although women were granted more opportunities of employment, they were still continuously shut out of traditionally male-dominated roles, including metalwork, chemicals, tool-making, steel, and construction. This is ironic, considering Detroit was a production hub during the war—its many automotive factories were continuously churning out tanks, air crafts, and weapons. These gender-based restrictions limited the types of jobs women could hold, which led many women to work entry-level jobs in assembly lines where they were not expected, nor authorized to partake in more physical tasks. Because women could not participate in these more grueling tasks, employers used this as an excuse to under-pay them, and restrict their benefits. Women were still expected to be responsible for house-work and childcare, making it difficult for them to work the longer hours, and resulted in high rates of absenteeism, leaving them with an unsteady source of income. This created a vicious cycle, where women were simultaneously expected to take on the role of the &quot;man of the house&quot;, while not being given the same opportunities males were. The on-going tug-of-war between country and family left many women in a limbo, where they could not safely rely on their work to afford supporting their children.

African American women were especially discriminated against on the basis of &quot;both&quot; their race and sex. Many firms and factories prioritized white women, leading to African American women working in more dangerous environments where they were often harassed by their white male co-workers. In 1943, out of the 50 war production plants in Detroit that hired women, only 19 allowed African American women to work. Due to these restrictions, only 20% of African American women had a job by 1950, leaving many of their families searching for domestic or short-term stints to afford housing and food.

It is often said that women &quot;gained more rights&quot; during World War II. While it is true that women were encouraged to take a more proactive position in society, they were still faced with many barriers—especially women of color. It is difficult to raise an entire family with the number of job restrictions and lack of employment opportunities that women experienced. When their husbands and white men specifically, returned from war, they were often given their previously held employment positions, leaving newly widowed women to search elsewhere for any work.

===Great Depression===
After the 1928 presidential campaign of Catholic Al Smith, the Democrats mobilize large number of Polish and other Catholic ethnics to make their comeback. Although the election for mayor was nonpartisan, the Democrats rallied behind Judge Frank Murphy, who served as mayor 1930–33. The Great Depression was devastating for Detroit, as sales of automobiles plunged and there were large-scale layoffs at all industrial enterprises. Murphy insisted that no one would go hungry, and set up the Mayor&#x27;s Unemployment Committee that set up relief soup kitchens and potato gardens. In 1933, Murphy resigned, and Frank Couzens was elected mayor, serving until 1938. He was the son of Republican U.S. Senator James Couzens, who had been mayor in 1919–22. In 1933, the city was in a financial crisis, as tax receipts had plunged and welfare spending had skyrocketed. The city had defaulted on its bond payments and had to use promissory notes (&quot; script&quot;) to pay teachers, policemen and other employees. Couzens restored the city&#x27;s financial credibility by cutting the debt and balancing the budget. He obtained large sums of federal relief money, and upgraded the street-lighting program and the sewage system.

As Detroit become more industrialized, workers banded together to establish labor unions, such as the United Auto Workers in 1940. These unions settled wage, time, and benefit disputes with manufacturers. Though labor unions were less powerful than the manufacturers themselves, they shaped much of the development of Detroit&#x27;s labor market, especially during World War II. Over 50% of Detroit&#x27;s laborers belonged to a union by 1950, which in theory increased their image as &quot;one unified body&quot; from a manufacturer&#x27;s perspective. With so many employees involved in unions, manufacturers were more prone to listening to their demands, which established a good working relationship between both parties, and led to &quot;economic security and employment stability&quot; for unionized laborers.

Despite these benefits, however, labor unions were less beneficial toward people of color, especially African Americans. Their decisions often allowed, or even reinforced, discriminatory hiring practices by prioritizing white males compared to African American workers. They rarely vouched for African Americans in management positions, leading to most hired African Americans working entry-level positions for years. This created a long-standing falsified reputation of African Americans in the industrial sector: since few were given the opportunity to be in management positions, employers automatically—and wrongly—assumed they did not deserve to be.

Like most things, labor unions showcased both the positives and negatives of Detroit&#x27;s history. They were created to grant more transparency between workers and their employers, but only reinforced the socio-economic divide between white workers and workers of color. Over time, however, the role of the union has become more diversified. In the later years of the Great Depression, unions like the United Auto Workers partnered with African American churches and civil rights organizations like the NAACP to integrate African American workers into the benefits that other workers already received. They increased African American membership, vouched for more civil rights in the workforce, and are a large reason for the increase in African American employment during World War II, when factories and manufacturers were in need of more workers. In fact, labor activism during the later 20th century increased influence of union leaders in the city such as Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters and Walter Reuther of the autoworkers.

The unionization process in autos was led by CIO organizers. The strongest response came not from semi-skilled assembly line men, but from the militant leadership of skilled tool and die makers of Irish ethnicity. They had been complacent during the late 1920s but reacted with extreme militancy to the hardships of the depression. Following the success of the sit down strikes at General Motors, non-unionized, semi-skilled workers followed suit in numerous plants in 1937. They were supported by the pro-union mood of the city, the New Deal&#x27;s permissive political climate, and Governor Frank Murphy&#x27;s pro-labor sympathies. They won many concessions and formed numerous locals outside the auto industry. Ford, however, successfully resisted unions until 1941.

=== World War II and the &quot;Arsenal of Democracy&quot; ===
The entry of the United States into World War II brought tremendous changes to the city. From 1942 to 1945, production of commercial automobiles in the city ceased entirely, as its factories were used instead to construct M5 tanks, jeeps, and B-24 bombers for the Allies. The Guardian Building was converted into a headquarters for wartime production. The city made a major contribution to the Allied war effort as part of America&#x27;s Arsenal of Democracy. Historians note that this accolade was &quot;easily and often corrupted to &#x27;arsehole&#x27;&quot; by tired Detroiters waiting in lines everywhere. The government believed that Detroit was vulnerable to air attack, and encouraged companies to diversify production to outside the region.

The B-24 Liberator, the most produced bomber in history, was used to bomb Germany heavily. Before the war, the aviation industry could produce, optimally, one such plane a day at an aircraft plant. By 1943, Ford&#x27;s plants managed to produce one B-24 an hour at a peak of 600 per month in 24-hour shifts. Many pilots slept on cots waiting for takeoff as the B-24 rolled off the assembly line at Ford&#x27;s Willow Run facility.

Detroit&#x27;s wartime manufacturing boom coincided with the decline of Southern agriculture, attracting hundreds of thousands of Southern Blacks to the city in search of economic security and freedom from racist Jim Crow laws.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} The ongoing draft pillaged Detroit&#x27;s industrial labor supply, leaving a labor shortage so dire that former auto plants had no choice but to hire black workers. According to a 1944 report, &quot;a 44% advance in wartime employment brought with it an advance of 103% in the total number of Negroes employed&quot;.

As Detroit&#x27;s black population continued to increase, housing options grew distressingly scarce.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} Unscrupulous landlords took advantage of the influx of black workers and limited housing supply, gouging monthly rent prices in Black neighborhoods. In some cases, Black tenants paid &quot;20 to 40 percent more for rent than whites in equivalent apartments&quot;. Spending the majority of their meager wages on rent, Blacks had no disposable income left to afford the upkeep and repair of their rental properties. Lacking maintenance, the decrepit homes of black neighborhoods turned substandard: grossly congested, lacking water and ventilation, infested with vermin, and prone to fires. White homeowners attributed Black poverty to &quot;individual moral deficiencies&quot;, strengthening their collective desire to preserve segregation.

President Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal tried to alleviate the housing crisis by simultaneously subsidizing the construction of public housing and private, single-family homes. Working-class whites staunchly opposed public housing, claiming that it jeopardized the construction of new homes and disturbed the &quot;racial and architectural homogeneity&quot; of their neighborhoods. The anti public-housing movement appropriated World War II rhetoric to denounce public housing as a communist conspiracy, a catalyst of racial struggle that would &quot;destroy traditional American values&quot;. Too poor to join the cohorts of whites fleeing to racially-homogenous suburbs, working-class whites banded together to terrorize Blacks out of their neighborhoods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} In 1941, the Detroit Housing Commission announced the construction of the Sojourner Truth housing project in the Seven-Mile Fenelon neighborhood. Months of protest by the Seven Mile-Fenelon Improvement Association climaxed on February 28, 1942, the day the first black families moved into the project. A vicious race riot resulted in 40 injuries and 220 arrests, the majority of which were black. Seven years later, Mayor Albert Cobo announced he was &quot;putting brakes on all public housing development outside of heavily black inner-city neighborhoods&quot; much to the delight of the white voters who elected him.

Although President Roosevelt&#x27;s promise of private homeownership was meant to extend to blacks, local implementation of housing policy further solidified the ghettoization of black neighborhoods. The Home Owners&#x27; Loan Corporation (HOLC) subsidized &quot;home purchases and improvements with low-interest loans&quot; in order to &quot;protect homeownership from foreclosure&quot;. The appraisal practices of HOLC agents, which determined eligibility for subsidized loans and mortgages, excluded Blacks from private homeownership through the structurally racist process of redlining. Racially restrictive housing covenants further limited housing options for black people, even after the 1948 Supreme Court case Shelley vs Kraemer reversed the legality of such covenants.

During World War II, Detroit became a center of industry, largely due to its innovative roots. The treatment of African Americans during World War II, however, represented the duality between an increase in labor and a decrease in the standard of living. The United States preached the gospel of freedom and human rights abroad while discriminatory federal policy, executed by a racist city government, robbed Black Detroiters of safe and affordable housing. Racial animosity over limited housing only mounted as veterans returned home from the war, boiling over in the riot-ridden 1950s and 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

===Postwar era===
In economic terms, the postwar years 1945–1970 brought high levels of prosperity as the automobile industry had its most prosperous quarter-century.

Although Detroit had a Rapid Transit Commission, it was not popular with the politicians or the public after the strikes of 1946 ended and automobile production resumed. People demanded cars so they could commute from work to spacious houses surrounded by grass instead of riding the trolley to cramped upstairs apartments. During the war, three expressways were built to support the region&#x27;s war industries. Furthermore, the wartime model of federal, state, and local governments jointly planning and funding expressways gave a successful model for planning and financing more highways. Progress was slow from 1945 to 1947 because of inflation, steel shortages, and the difficulty of building in built-up areas. by the early 1950s highways were in place, and plans were underway to make Detroit a central hub in the forthcoming Interstate Highway System. The new highways had a funding advantage over mass transit because of the availability of federal highway monies coupled with the availability of matching state money. Ultimately, they were paid for by gasoline taxes, which commuters seldom grumbled about.

Other sources indicate the replacement of Detroit&#x27;s large electric streetcar network with buses and highways was much more controversial. In 1930, Detroit had 30 electric streetcar lines over 534 miles of track. In 1941, a streetcar ran on Woodward Avenue every 60 seconds at peak times. Wartime restrictions on vital war materials such as rubber and gasoline caused particularly heavy use of the streetcar system during the 1940s. However, between the end of the war and 1949, the city discontinued half of its 20 streetcar lines. Five more were discontinued in 1951—three of them switched abruptly to bus lines during a DSR strike. More closings followed until August 1955, when Mayor Albert Cobo, who promoted freeway construction as the way of the future, urged the city council to sell the city&#x27;s recently purchased fleet of modern streetcars to Mexico City. It was a controversial move. A newspaper poll showed that Detroiters, by a margin of 3-to-1, opposed the switch to buses. Some even jeered the sunken freeways Cobo championed, dubbing them &quot;Cobo canals&quot;. &quot;A lot of people were against the decision ... A common complaint was about the sale of the [new] cars, that the city didn&#x27;t get its money&#x27;s worth. Of course, the city had an answer for anything.&quot; On April 8, 1956, the last streetcar in Detroit rolled down Woodward Avenue. After less than 10 years in service, Detroit&#x27;s fleet of streamlined streetcars was loaded on railcars and shipped to Mexico City, where they ran for another 30 years.

The Hudson&#x27;s department store, the second largest in the nation, realized that the limited parking space at its downtown skyscraper would increasingly be a problem for its customers. The solution in 1954 was to open the Northland Center in nearby Southfield, just beyond the city limits. It was the largest suburban shopping center in the world and quickly became the main shopping destination for northern and western Detroit, and for much of the suburbs. By 1961, the downtown skyscraper accounted for only half of Hudson&#x27;s sales; it closed in 1986. The Hudson&#x27;s name would later be discarded all together. The remaining Hudsons were first rebranded as branches of Chicago&#x27;s flagship Marshall Field&#x27;s State Street, and later rebranded again as branches of New York City&#x27;s flagship Macy&#x27;s Herald Square.

Ethnic whites enjoyed high wages and suburban life styles. Blacks comprised 4% of the auto labor force in 1942, 15% by the war&#x27;s end; they held their own and were at 16% by 1960. They started in unskilled jobs, making them susceptible to layoffs and to replacement when automation came. The powerful United Auto Workers union championed state and federal civil rights legislation, but was in no hurry to advance blacks in the union hierarchy. a large well-paid middle class black community emerged; like their white counterparts, they wanted to own single family homes, fought for respectability, and left the blight and crime of the slums as fast as possible for outlying districts and suburbs.

By 1945, Detroit was running out of space for new factories; tight-knit home-owning neighborhoods rejected the notion of tearing out housing to make room for factories. There was plenty of space in the suburbs, and that is where the factories had to locate. The proposals of liberal UAW leaders such as Walter Reuther for urban redevelopment did not please the UAW&#x27;s largely white, conservative membership. The members repeatedly voted for conservative mayoral candidates, such as Republicans Albert Cobo (mayor 1950–57) and Louis Miriani (mayor 1957–62), for they protected white neighborhoods from residential integration. Home ownership was not just a very large financial investment for individuals, it was also a source of identity for men who remembered the hardships and foreclosures of the Great Depression. Sugrue says, &quot;Economically vulnerable homeowners feared, above all, that an influx of blacks would imperil their precarious investments.&quot;

As mayor in 1957–1962, Louis Miriani was best known for completing many of the large-scale urban renewal projects initiated by the Cobo administration. These were largely financed by federal money, due to his rejection of implementing a city tax. Miriani also took strong measures to overcome the growing crime rate in Detroit. The United Automobile Workers (UAW), then at the height of its size and power, officially endorsed Miriani for re-election, stressing what they viewed as his conservative &quot;law and order&quot; position. However, while some African Americans praised Miriani for helping to break down racial divides, other disagreed with the UAW that Miriani did enough.

Historian David Maraniss cites milestones from 1962 to 1964 that marked the city&#x27;s sharp decline: the failure of a plan to host the Olympics; urban renewal uprooting black neighborhoods; urgently needed police reforms that stalled; and the failure to transform Detroit through the Model Cities and War on Poverty programs. Tensions started building that exploded in the 1967 riot, the most costly and violent in the country during a summer of numerous riots in various North American cities.

The 1970s brought a worldwide energy crisis with high gasoline prices. For the first time, the American industry faced serious competition from imported automobiles, which were smaller and more fuel-efficient. German Volkswagens and Japanese Toyotas posed a growing threat.

===Civil rights and the Great Society===
{{Main|Decline of Detroit}}
In June 1963, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a major speech in Detroit that foreshadowed his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech two months later. In Detroit, King was accompanied by Rev. C. L. Franklin. Detroit played a major role in the civil rights movement of the 1960s; the Model Cities Program was a key component of President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Great Society and War on Poverty. Begun in 1966, it operated five-year-long experiments in 150 cities to develop new anti-poverty programs and alternative forms of municipal government. The ambitious federal urban aid program succeeded in fostering a new generation of mostly black urban leaders.

Detroit had one of the larger Model Cities projects. It promised a great deal and delivered much less, as Detroit suffered from the unintended consequences. Mayor Jerome Cavanagh (Mayor 1962–69) was the only elected official to serve on Johnson&#x27;s task force. Detroit received widespread acclaim for its leadership in the program, which used $490 million to try to turn a nine-square-mile section of the city (with 134,000 inhabitants) into a model city. The city&#x27;s political and business elite, and city planners, along with the black middle class, wanted the federal funding to assist the economic growth of the entire city. They sought to protect the central business district property values from nearby slums and to construct new revenue-generating structures. But, local community organizers and civil rights activists rallied poor residents in opposition to these plans. They said federal renewal funding should be used to replace deteriorating housing stock, whether with new public housing or low-cost housing built by private developers. The Model Cities Program was terminated in Detroit (and nationwide) in 1974 after major race riots in the late 1960s in most of its target cities.

Detroit witnessed growing confrontations between the mostly white police force and inner city blacks, culminating in the massive 12th Street riot in July 1967. The riot erupted in mostly black neighborhoods. Governor George W. Romney ordered the Michigan National Guard into Detroit, and President Johnson sent in U.S. Army troops. The result was 43 dead, 467 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed. Thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods, and the affected district lay in ruins for decades.

Coleman Young, Detroit&#x27;s first black mayor, explained the long-term effects of the riot:

The heaviest casualty, however, was the city. Detroit&#x27;s losses went a hell of a lot deeper than the immediate toll of lives and buildings. The riot put Detroit on the fast track to economic desolation, mugging the city and making off with incalculable value in jobs, earnings taxes, corporate taxes, retail dollars, sales taxes, mortgages, interest, property taxes, development dollars, investment dollars, tourism dollars, and plain damn money. The money was carried out in the pockets of the businesses and the white people who fled as fast as they could. The white exodus from Detroit had been prodigiously steady prior to the riot, totally twenty-two thousand in 1966, but afterwards it was frantic. In 1967, with less than half the year remaining after the summer explosion—the outward population migration reached sixty-seven thousand. In 1968 the figure hit eighty-thousand, followed by forty-six thousand in 1969.

Scholars have produced many studies documenting the fall of Detroit from one of the world&#x27;s premier industrial cities in 1945 to a much smaller, weaker city in the 21st century, struggling to survive against the loss of industry and population, against crime, corruption and poverty. Boyle also blames the big corporations. He summarizes the scholarly consensus in 2001:

Detroit was betrayed by a lack of political vision, torn asunder by racial conflict, and devastated by deindustrialization. Detroit&#x27;s problems peaked in the late 1960s and the 1970s. Since then the city has struggled to recover, to build a new economy and a new polity. However noble the goals, though, these efforts have failed to reverse Detroit&#x27;s deterioration. Motown remains in the grip of the crisis that began fifty years ago.

====&quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot;====
On August 18, 1970, the NAACP filed suit against Michigan state officials, including Governor William Milliken, charging &quot;de facto&quot; public school segregation. The trial began April 6, 1971, and lasted 41 days. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices (such as redlining of certain neighborhoods) and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. District Judge Steven J. Roth held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in his ruling on &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot;. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, withholding judgment on the relationship of housing inequality with education. The court specified that it was the state&#x27;s responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area.

The governor and other accused officials appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot; decision had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced to solve problems in the city&#x27;s school district. According to Gary Orfield and Susan E. Eaton in their 1996 book &quot;Dismantling Desegregation&quot;, the &quot;Supreme Court&#x27;s failure to examine the housing underpinnings of metropolitan segregation&quot; in Milliken made desegregation &quot;almost impossible&quot; in northern metropolitan areas. &quot;Suburbs were protected from desegregation by the courts ignoring the origin of their racially segregated housing patterns.&quot; &quot;Milliken was perhaps the greatest missed opportunity of that period&quot;, said Myron Orfield, professor of law and director of the Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity at the University of Minnesota. &quot;Had that gone the other way, it would have opened the door to fixing nearly all of Detroit&#x27;s current problems.&quot;

John Mogk, a professor of law and an expert in urban planning at Wayne State University in Detroit, says, &quot;Everybody thinks that it was the riots [in 1967] that caused the white families to leave. Some people were leaving at that time but, really, it was after Milliken that you saw mass flight to the suburbs. If the case had gone the other way, it is likely that Detroit would not have experienced the steep decline in its tax base that has occurred since then.&quot;

Supreme Justice William O. Douglas&#x27; dissenting opinion in Miliken held that

there is, so far as the school cases go, no constitutional difference between de facto and de jure segregation. Each school board performs state action for Fourteenth Amendment purposes when it draws the lines that confine it to a given area, when it builds schools at particular sites, or when it allocates students. The creation of the school districts in Metropolitan Detroit either maintained existing segregation or caused additional segregation. Restrictive covenants maintained by state action or inaction build black ghettos ... the task of equity is to provide a unitary system for the affected area where, as here, the State washes its hands of its own creations.

While 55 percent of Detroiters were counted as white in the 1970 census, by 1980 the city&#x27;s proportion of white residents had declined to 34 percent of the population. The population shift was even more stark considering that Detroit was 83 percent white at the time of the city&#x27;s all-time population high in 1950. The migration of whites to the suburbs left blacks in control of a city suffering from an inadequate tax base, and too few jobs. According to Chafets, &quot;Among the nation&#x27;s major cities, Detroit was at or near the top of unemployment, poverty per capita, and infant mortality throughout the 1980s.&quot;

In the 1973 mayoral election the polarization was nearly total, as 92% of blacks voted for Coleman Young, while 91% of the whites voted for former police Commissioner John Nichols, although neither appealed to racial issues during the campaign. Although Young had emerged from the far left element in Detroit, he moved to the right after his election. He called an ideological truce and won the support of Detroit&#x27;s economic elite. The new mayor was energetic in the construction of the Joe Louis Arena, and upgrading the city&#x27;s mediocre mass transit system. Highly controversial was his using eminent domain to purchase and raze a 465-acre inner-city neighborhood known as Poletown that was home to 3,500 people, mostly Polish property owners, in order to make way for a half-billion-dollar General Motors Cadillac assembly plant. Rich argues that he pulled money out of the neighborhood to rehabilitate the downtown business district, because &quot;there were no other options.&quot; Young tried to rein in the city&#x27;s largely white police department, and its aggressive tactics angered black voters.

Young was an outspoken advocate for federal funding for Detroit construction projects, and his administration saw the completion of the Renaissance Center, Detroit People Mover, and several other Detroit landmarks. During Young&#x27;s last two terms there he faced angry opposition from neighborhood activists. He usually prevailed, winning re-election by wide margins in 1977, 1981, 1985, and 1989, for a total of 20 years as mayor, based largely on black votes.

On August 16, 1987, Northwest Airlines Flight 255 crashed near Detroit, killing all but one of the 155 people on board, as well as two people on the ground.

====Crime====
Young was blamed for failing to stem the crime epidemic that Detroit became notorious for in the 1970s and 1980s. Dozens of violent black street gangs gained control of the city&#x27;s large drug trade, which began with the heroin epidemic of the 1970s and grew into the even larger crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s. There were numerous major criminal gangs that were founded in Detroit and dominated the drug trade at various times; most were short-lived. They included The Errol Flynns (east side), Nasty Flynns (later the NF Bangers) and Black Killers and the drug consortiums of the 1980s such as Young Boys Inc., Pony Down, Best Friends, Black Mafia Family and the Chambers Brothers. The Young Boys were innovative, opening franchises in other cities, using youth too young to be prosecuted, promoting brand names, and unleashing extreme brutality to frighten away rivals.

In June 1971, eight African-Americans were found shot dead in a house on Hazelwood Street, the worst mass killing in Detroit&#x27;s history.

Several times during Young&#x27;s tenure Detroit was named the arson capital of the U.S., and repeatedly the murder capital of the United States. Often Detroit was listed by FBI crime statistics as the &quot;most dangerous city in America&quot; during his administration. Crime rates in Detroit peaked in 1991 at more than 2,700 violent crimes per 100,000 people.

Crime continued to be a problem in Detroit long after Young&#x27;s tenure as mayor ended. The arson rate in Detroit was 6.3 times the national average in 2003 and the murder rate was 5.1 times the national average. The majority of Detroit residents, including many Blacks, have left the city, leaving a glut of abandoned buildings that have become magnets for drugs, arson, and other crime.

The night of October 30, the night before Halloween, was a traditional day for pranks but became known as &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot; as Detroit youth went on a rampage in the 1980s. A tradition of light-hearted minor vandalism, such as soaping windows, had emerged in the 1930s, but by the 1980s it had become, said Mayor Coleman, &quot;a vision from hell.&quot; The arson primarily took place in the inner city, but surrounding suburbs were often affected as well. The crimes became increasingly more destructive.

Over 800 fires were set in the peak year 1984, overwhelming the city&#x27;s fire department. Hundreds of vacant homes across the city were set ablaze by arsonists. The fires continued to happen but the number was sharply reduced by razing thousands of abandoned houses that often were used to sell drugs as well, namely 5,000 in 1989-90 alone. Every year the city mobilizes &quot;Angel&#x27;s Night&quot;, with tens of thousands of volunteers patrolling areas at high risk.

The city of Detroit, in the U.S. state of Michigan, has gone through a major economic and demographic decline in recent decades. The population of the city has fallen from a high of 1,850,000 in 1950 to 680,000 in 2015, removing it from the top 20 of US cities by population for the first time since 1850. Local crime rates are among the highest in the United States (even though the overall crime rate in the city has seen a decline during the 21st century), and vast areas of the city are in a state of severe urban decay. In 2013, Detroit filed the largest municipal bankruptcy case in U.S. history, which it successfully exited on December 10, 2014.

{{As of|2017}}, the median household income is rising, and criminal activity is decreasing by 5% annually as of 2017.

The deindustrialization of Detroit has been a major factor in the population decline of the city.

====Role of the automobile industry====
Before the advent of the automobile, Detroit was a small, compact regional manufacturing center. In 1900, Detroit had a population of 285,000 people, making it the thirteenth-largest city in the U.S. Over the following decades, the growth of the automobile industry, including affiliated activities such as parts and tooling manufacturing, came to dwarf all other manufacturing in the city. The industry drew a million new residents to the city. At Ford Motor&#x27;s iconic and enormous River Rouge plant alone, opened in 1927 in Detroit&#x27;s neighbor Dearborn, there were over 90,000 workers. The shifting nature of the workforce stimulated by the rapid growth of the auto industry had an important impact on the city&#x27;s future development. The new workers came from diverse and soon far-flung places. Nearby Canada was important early on and many other workers came from eastern and southern Europe, a large portion of them being ethnic Italians, Hungarians, and Poles. An important attraction for these workers was that the new assembly line techniques required little prior training or education to get a job in the industry.

The breadth of sources for the growing demand for auto assembly workers, however, was sharply limited by the turmoil of World War I, and shortly thereafter by the restrictive U.S. Immigration Act of 1924, with its limited annual quotas for new immigrants. In response, the industry—with Ford in the forefront—turned in a significant way to hiring African-Americans, who were leaving the South in huge numbers in response to the combination of the interwar farm crisis and continuing Jim Crow practices. By 1930 Detroit&#x27;s population had grown to nearly 1.6 million, and then to nearly 2 million by its peak shortly before 1950. A World War II boom in the manufacture of war materiel contributed to this growth surge. This population was, however, very spread out in comparison with other U.S. industrial cities. A variety of factors associated with the auto industry fed this trend. There was the large influx of workers. They earned comparatively high wages in the auto industry. The plants they worked at, belonging to various major and minor manufacturers, were spread around the city. The workers tended to live along extended bus and streetcar lines leading to their workplaces. The result of these influences, beginning already by the 1920s, was that many workers bought or built their own single-family or duplex homes. They did not tend to live in large apartment houses, as in New York, or in closely spaced row houses as in Philadelphia. After New Deal labor legislation, high auto-union secured wages and benefits facilitated this willingness to take on the cost and risk of home ownership.

These decentralizing trends did not have equal effects on African-American residents of the city. Black Detroiters tended to have far less access to New Deal mortgage support programs such as Federal Housing Authority and Veterans Administration insured mortgages. African-American neighborhoods were viewed by lenders and the federal programs as riskier, resulting—in this period—in much lower rates of homeownership for African-Americans than other residents of the city.

The auto industry also gave rise to a large number of high paying management and executive jobs. There were also large numbers of attorneys, advertisers, and other workers who supported the industry&#x27;s managerial force. These workers already by the 1920s had begun to move to neighborhoods well removed from the industry&#x27;s factories and higher crime rates. This upper stratum moved to outlying neighborhoods, and further, to well-to-do suburbs such as Bloomfield Hills and Grosse Pointe. Oakland County, north of the city, became a popular place to live for executives in the industry. &quot;By the second half of the twentieth century, it was one of the wealthiest counties in the United States, a place profoundly shaped by the concentration of auto-industry-derived wealth.&quot;

Public policy was automobile oriented. Funds were directed to the building of expressways for automobile traffic, to the detriment of public transit and the inner-city neighborhoods through which the expressways were cut to get to the auto factories and the downtown office buildings.

These processes, in which the growth of the auto industry had played such a large part, combined with racial segregation to give Detroit, by 1960, its particularly noteworthy character of a substantially African-American inner city surrounded by mainly white outer sections of the city and suburbs. By 1960 there were more whites living in the city&#x27;s suburbs than the city itself. On the other hand, there were very few African-Americans in the suburbs. Real estate agents would not sell to them, and if African-Americans did try to move into suburbs there was &quot;intense hostility and often violence&quot; in reaction.

The auto industry too was decentralizing away from Detroit proper. This change was facilitated by the great concentration of automobile production into the hands of the &quot;Big Three&quot; of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. The Big Three were able to build cars better and cheaper and put nearly every smaller competitor automaker out of business. While this corporate concentration was taking place, the Big Three were shifting their production out of central Detroit to escape the auto-union wage requirements. Between 1945 and 1957 the Big Three built 25 new manufacturing plants in the metropolitan area, not one of them in the city itself.

The number and character of these new, suburban auto factories was a harbinger of future trends detrimental to the economic health of Detroit. There was an interaction between factory decentralization and the nature of the industry&#x27;s post-New Deal unionized labor force. Ford Motor was one of the first to undertake major decentralization, in reaction to labor developments. Ford&#x27;s workers voted to join the UAW in 1941. This led Ford to be concerned about the vulnerability of its huge flagship Rouge River plant to labor unrest. The workers at this plant were &quot;among the industry&#x27;s most well-organized, racially and ethnically diverse, and militant&quot;. A strike at this key plant could bring the company&#x27;s manufacturing operations as a whole to a halt. Ford therefore decentralized operations from this plant, to soften union power (and to introduce new technologies in new plants, and expand to new markets). Ford often built up parallel production facilities, making the same products, so that the effect of a strike at any one facility would be lessened. The results for the River Rouge plant are striking. From its peak labor force of 90,000 around 1930, the number of workers there declined to 30,000 by 1960 and only about 6,000 by 1990. This decline was mainly due to labor movement to non-union areas and automation.

The spread of the auto industry outward from Detroit proper in the 1950s was the beginning of a process that extended much further afield. The major auto plants left in Detroit were closed down, and their workers increasingly left behind. When the auto industry&#x27;s facilities moved out, there were dramatically adverse economic ripple effects on the city. The neighborhood businesses that had catered to auto workers shut down. This direct and indirect economic contraction caused the city to lose property taxes, wage taxes, and population (and thus consumer demand). The closed auto plants were also often abandoned in a period before strong environmental regulation, causing the sites to become so-called &quot;brownfields&quot;, unattractive to potential replacement businesses because of the pollution hangover from decades of industrial production. The pattern of the deteriorating city by the mid-1960s was visibly associated with the largely departed auto industry. The neighborhoods with the most closed stores, vacant houses, and abandoned lots were in what had formerly been the most heavily populated parts of the city, adjacent to the now-closed older major auto plants.

By the 1970s and 1980s, the auto industry suffered setbacks that further impacted Detroit. The industry encountered the rise of OPEC and the resulting sharp increase in gasoline prices. It faced new and intense international competition, particularly from Italian, Japanese and German automobile manufacturers. Chrysler avoided bankruptcy in the late 1970s only with the aid of a federal bailout. GM and Ford also struggled financially. It also relocated ever more of its manufacturing to lower-cost states in the U.S. and to low-income countries. Detroit&#x27;s residents thus had access to fewer and fewer well-paying, secure auto manufacturing jobs.

The leadership of Detroit failed to diversify the city&#x27;s industry beyond automotive manufacturers and related industries. Because the city had flourished in the heyday of the auto industry, local politicians made periodic attempts to stimulate a revival of the auto industry in the city. For example, in the 1980s the cities of Detroit and Hamtramck used the power of eminent domain to level part of what had been Poletown to make a parking lot for a new automobile factory. On that site, a new, low-rise suburban type Cadillac plant was built, with substantial government subsidies. The new Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly employs 1,600 workers. In the 1990s, the city subsidized the building of a new Chrysler plant on the city&#x27;s east side, Jefferson North Assembly, which employs 4,600 people.{{when|date=October 2017}} In 2009 Chrysler filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, and survives in a partnership with Fiat of Italy. while GM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 1, 2009, and survives as a much smaller company—smaller now than Japan&#x27;s Toyota Motor Corporation. A little over two years after these major blows to the U.S. auto industry, the city itself went into Chapter 9 bankruptcy after years of mismanagement by local leaders.

====Racial housing segregation====
{{see also|Redlining}}

During World War II, wartime manufacturing expanded urban employment for black job seekers who were historically underrepresented in Detroit&#x27;s labor market as labor policies sanctioned hiring discrimination. Despite the expansion of employment available to black Detroiters, racial integration within the workplace was met with fierce opposition from Blue-collar white employees. For these white Detroiters, black employment harbored intense housing competition within Detroit&#x27;s overcrowded neighborhoods in addition to crumbling the economic stability of Detroit&#x27;s white middle class. Therefore, as racial integration within the workplace alluded to racially fluid neighborhoods, the white middle class engaged in residential segregation by using discriminatory behavior and policy to regulate black residential agency and accessibility to homeownership.

Transitioning into the postwar period, the economic hardships of manufacturing industries, stemming from suburbanization, along with overpriced rental housing, forced urban black communities to fall on hard times, devolving into decrepit remnants of Detroit&#x27;s industrial surgency and booming wartime economy. The mass migration of hopeful blacks from the Jim Crow-perpetuated racism and segregation of the South into Northern neighborhoods coupled with sluggish housing construction flooded Detroit with overpopulation, limited funding, and residential mistreatment. Black families faced large down payments, high-interest land contracts, and high maintenance costs of living facilities. The disparate treatment of Black families by landlords remained absent from the political agendas of elected Detroit leaders such as Albert Cobo, who defended the rights of landlords to operate their properties as they saw fit. Given the decentralization of manufacturing, terrible living conditions, and overpopulation, many Black Detroiters sought occupancy in more resourceful middle-class neighborhoods, but found it was not an easy process.

During the Roosevelt administration, the New Deal molded the urban landscape as a battleground of interracial hostility and residential segregation. The New Deal policy sought to expand homeownership for low-income residents through the construction of federally subsidized public housing. For many Americans, homeownership symbolized responsible citizenship, financial investment, and social prestige, all of which were signs of upward mobility and middle-class status. However, the economic intervention of the federal government in expanding affordable housing presented a fundamental disconnect between New Deal policy and black homeownership. This disconnect remained ingrained in the racist and classist ideologies of the white middle class that viewed public housing as a taxpayer-handout for the poor while foreseeing severe depreciation of single-family homes within neighborhoods that were the sites of public housing construction. Consequently, independent homeowners inhibited the construction of New Deal sponsored public housing by using civic disorder and rioting as political tools to consolidate homeowner rejection of black occupancy in middle-class neighborhoods. Consequently, the political dominance white homeowners assumed in Detroit&#x27;s housing disputes encouraged the Detroit Housing Commission (DHC) to establish racist policies, such as the continuation of racial segregation within Detroit&#x27;s housing market, allowing the DHC to avoid the racial bloodshed of public housing construction.
Additionally, New Deal policy promoted the formation of private-public partnerships to manage the allocation of federal funds within local municipalities. These private-public partnerships established residential segregation through a tactic called redlining, which restricted the movement of black Detroiters into middle-class neighborhoods. In particular, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) effectively marked the racial boundaries of Detroit to determine the actuarial soundness of urban neighborhoods. Therefore, redlining governed the dispersal of federal loans and subsidies on the basis of the racial composition of a neighborhood. Local real estate brokers and lenders refused to allocate federal funds to predominantly black communities such as Paradise Valley along with neighborhoods that had only a handful of black residents as these areas were all categorized as unfit and hazardous investments for mortgages. By preventing black from the ability to attain mortgage loans from local banks, the New Deal private-public partnerships used redlining to protect the property values and investment opportunities for white middle-class homes. Therefore, redlining circumscribed black homeownership in middle-class neighborhoods through the spatial and social isolation of black Detroiters in Detroit&#x27;s expanding ghettos. Simultaneously, this residential segregation also exacerbated the economic instability of black Detroiters as these residents were forced to succumb to deteriorating housing without appreciating assets while the high rates of unemployment of black Detroiters made them exceedingly vulnerable to losing their homes through eviction or tax foreclosure.

Because the local government had the final say over the distribution of federal funds for home loan eligibility, there were no major alternatives for obtaining loans for a new home, which further promoted the precarious and unstable living conditions of black Detroiters. The redemptive capacity of the private-public partnership between local Detroit banks and the FHA-HOLC funneled a vicious territorialism of the white middle class that upheld the high property values of white neighborhoods by unequivocally suppressing the upward mobility of black Detroiters. Collectively, black integration into white neighborhoods greatly depreciated property values, further motivating white Detroiters to keep their neighborhoods segregated. Despite the creation of an affordable housing agenda that was rooted in liberal thought, Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal underhandedly restricted the residential agency of black Detroiters since it was predicated upon a de jure system of residential segregation. The New Deal policy policy remained tethered to the governmental imposition of societal and policy discrimination that aggravated structures of racism within Detroit&#x27;s fractured housing market. In the unfolding of the housing crisis within Detroit, the federal government perpetuated the marginalization of black Detroiters by neglecting the jarring racism and segregation that New Deal policy produced.

The theories of eugenics and racial inferiority that dictated FHA policymaking certainly translated into the FHA&#x27;s subsidization of black homeownership upon the cessation of redlining. During an era of racial liberalism, the FHA&#x27;s colorblindness and no redlining policy failed to reverse the cumulative effects of structural racism. In response to the prolonged refusal of mortgages for African Americans, the FHA passed the 1968 Housing and Urban Development Act (HUD) to encourage low-income homeownership through low-interest mortgage loans with the full financial backing of the federal government. FHA-HUD policy guaranteed that pay lenders would be compensated in full for the mortgage of foreclosed homes and by creating a housing market dominated by mortgage bankers, the FHA incentivized mortgage bankers to drive desperate black families to low-income homeownership, allowing bankers to inflate their economic gains by cycling these black families through tax foreclosures. Therefore, this racist and predatory provision of low-income housing through FHA-HUD policy elucidates that federal government was an inevitable perpetrator of racial segregation within Detroit&#x27;s housing market. Despite having access to mortgage loans, black Detroiters continued to be preyed upon by real estate bankers who earned tremendous profits from the inability of black Detroiters to keep up with the FHA-insured mortgage payments. For many black Detroiters, the dismissal of FHA redlining did not end the economic exploitation and residential segregation of black families at the hands of wealth-hungry bankers and lenders. Colorblind universalism within Detroit&#x27;s housing market remained a far-fetched aspiration of Black families in their pursuit of homeownership as FHA-HUD policy failed to dismantle the segregative impulses of the real estate industry.

Furthermore, the threat of racial integration in white communities facilitated the rise of neighborhood associations, which were coalitions of independent white homeowners that fervently protected homeownership rights through advocacy for residential segregation. Frequently, neighborhood associations relied on restrictive covenants to mandate legal barriers to black homeownership in middle-class neighborhoods to avoid the radical disinvestment that would stem from a racially integrated neighborhood. During the legality of restrictive covenants, these deed restrictions were explicitly racist and took the form of; &quot;people of color can&#x27;t purchase this home&quot;, or only for the &quot;Caucasian race&quot;. By leveraging the legally discriminatory capacity of restrictive covenants, neighborhood associations prioritized the stability of homeownership through the preservation of neighborhood investment and relatively high single-family home values. The homogenization of the economic and social fabric of middle-class neighborhoods reflected the white-afflicted segregation of Black Detroiters that confined these residents to Detroit&#x27;s oldest and worst housing stock. However, in the midst of a mid-twentieth century movement for civil rights reform, certain hallmark legal cases of discrimination in housing such as &quot;Shelley vs Kraemer&quot; deemed restrictive covenants unconstitutional. Upon this Supreme Court ruling, neighborhood associations were forced to change their restrictive zoning regulations as black Detroiters began moving out of the dilapidated Detroit ghetto and sought residency in middle-class neighborhoods. Therefore, the repealing of restrictive covenants resulted in neighborhood associations relying on extralegal subversions of restrictive covenants to alternatively stunt black residential integration. For example, neighborhood associations amended housing contracts to contain phrases such as &quot;undesirable&quot; rather than &quot;Black&quot; to avoid the explicit discrimination of housing based on race. These slight revisions in already racist housing contracts allowed neighborhood associations to remain legally immune during the discriminatory protection of middle-class homeownership from the perceived social disorder and housing depreciation of racially integrated neighborhoods. Therefore, throughout the history of restrictive covenants, the preservation of the social and economic stability of middle-class neighborhoods hardened the residential segregation of black Detroiters by placing restrictions on black homeownership. Overall, restrictive covenants reinforced unequal race relations and perpetuated racial divisions that continue to exacerbate the urban inequality of current-day Detroit.

Coupled with the ability of de jure discrimination to mandate residential segregation through policy, neighborhood associations curbed civil rights reform that sought to mitigate racism within housing. The middle-class mentality of neighborhood associations would govern the political climate of Detroit as this anti-integration constituency resonated with politicians who would dispel public housing and the threat of racial invasion. The 1949 mayoral election of Detroit pitted George Edwards, a UAW activist and public housing advocate, against Albert Cobo, a corporate executive and real estate investor. Cobo presented an unwavering distrust of government economic intervention and pledged to protect single-family home investment by disapproving federally funded public housing projects within Detroit Therefore, the anti-public housing and pro-homeownership sentiment of Albert Cobo garnered immense support from neighborhood associations that served an indispensable role in the overwhelming victory of Cobo over Edwards for mayor of Detroit.

A staunch opponent of integrated housing, mayor Cobo restructured the Mayor&#x27;s Interracial Committee (MIC), a large advocate group for housing equality and civil rights reform, into the Commission on Community Relations (CCR) that more closely aligned to the anti-civil rights and segregationist political identity of neighborhood associations. Additionally, Cobo enacted residential segregation and racism through DHC policy while vetoing public housing development within white neighborhoods, thus further debilitating the limited accessibility black Detroiters had affordable housing. During Cobo&#x27;s mayorship, neighborhood associations held political power within Detroit as the unregulated local government allowed for these inherently racist associations to dictate residential zoning and city planning that further strengthened the residential segregation of black Detroiters. Evidently, Cobo&#x27;s political regime displayed de facto segregation through the political mobilization of neighborhood associations and the private real-estate industry. However, the series of events that led to Cobo&#x27;s mayorship remained direct reflections of the violence launched on black Detroiters from de jure segregation through decades of racist and classist housing policies that bled urban neighborhoods of the most basic living conditions while hardening Detroit&#x27;s racial divide.

The systematic exclusion of black families from homeownership generationally suppressed black Detroiters from receiving the economic assets of homeownership, such as stable education, retirement, and business opportunities, which have created greater degrees of residential instability and precariousness. Overall, Detroit&#x27;s convoluted history of segregation reveals that homeownership should not be viewed as a means to overcome poverty as exploitative market dynamics and racist housing policy eradicate the dimension of impartiality within the United States housing market.

===Open housing movement===
In 1948, &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; and three other United States Supreme Court cases established that state enforcement of racially restrictive covenants was unconstitutional. This decision revitalized the advocacy for integrated neighborhoods. Suburbs around Detroit expanded dramatically as wealthy African-Americans moved into white neighborhoods. The singular asset that many white residents held after World War II was their home, and they feared that if Black people moved in, the value of their homes would plummet. This fear was preyed upon by blockbusting real estate agents who would manipulate Whites into selling their homes for cheap prices by convincing them that African-Americans were infiltrating the neighborhood. They would even send Black children to go door to door with pamphlets that read, &quot;Now is the best time to sell your house—you know that.&quot; With the means to pick up and leave, many white residents fled to the surrounding suburbs. This &quot;white flight&quot; took much away from the city: residents, the middle class, and tax revenues which kept up public services such as schools, police, and parks. Blockbusting agents then profited by reselling these houses at incredibly marked-up prices to African-Americans desperate to get out of the inner city.

These inflated prices were only affordable by the black &quot;elite&quot;. As wealthier black Detroiters moved into the previously white neighborhoods, they left behind low-income residents in the most inadequate houses at the highest rental. Redlining, restrictive covenants, local politics, and the open housing movement all contributed to the restricted movement of black, low-income Detroiters.

==== 1950s job losses ====

In the postwar period, the city had lost nearly 150,000 jobs to the suburbs. Factors were a combination of changes in technology, increased automation, auto industry consolidation, taxation policies, the need for different kinds of manufacturing space, and the highway system construction that eased commuter transportation. Major companies like Packard, Hudson, and Studebaker, as well as hundreds of smaller companies, declined significantly or went out of business entirely. In the 1950s, the unemployment rate hovered near 10 percent.

==== 1950s to 1960s freeway construction ====
{{See also|Automotive city}}
By the late 1940s, the economic wounds from years of redlining and restrictive covenants hurt the standard of living for many African Americans and minorities living in Detroit. With limited housing opportunities and sky-high rents, those living in &quot;red&quot; neighborhoods like Black Bottom and Paradise Valley often had little financial ability to pay for private apartments or housing repairs. Consequences of close-quarter living were exacerbated by an influx of black immigrants during the Great Migration and World War II. The decaying neighborhoods also developed sanitation problems; garbage pickups were rare, and trash littered the street, accelerating the spread of diseases and enticing pests. Perceptions of &quot;urban blight&quot; and a need for &quot;slum clearance&quot; in these areas were fueled especially by (majority white) Detroit city planners, who classified over two-thirds of housing in Paradise Valley as substandard.

Detroit Mayor Edward Jeffries put forth a plan for &quot;urban renewal&quot; in Black Bottom and Paradise Valley neighborhoods in 1944. Utilizing eminent domain laws, the government began taking down buildings in the Black Bottom neighborhood in 1949. Local government officials popularized the push for urban renewal in post-World War II Detroit in conjunction with real estate agents and bank owners, who stood to gain from investment in new buildings and wealthier residents. When the 1956 Highway Act mandated new highways routed through Detroit, the Black Bottom and Paradise Valley areas were an ideal placement; deconstruction of the site had already been started, and the political clout of slum clearance was more powerful than the limited ability residents had to advocate against the placement.

Though it faced urban poverty and overcrowding, the Black Bottom neighborhoods were an exciting mix of culture and innovation, with the economic district boasting approximately 350 black-owned businesses. The downtown area is often described as if Motown music played even from the pipes in the street. But when highway projects were announced, sometimes years before construction started and sometimes warning only thirty days in advance, the property values for those who did own land disappeared. The forced relocation condemned many residents to even harsher poverty, and the local government commissions made few efforts to assist families in relocation. It was difficult enough for the thousands of persons displaced to find new housing in a time where restrictive covenants, even though technically outlawed in 1948, were deftly and covertly written into many of Detroit&#x27;s surrounding neighborhoods. It was even harder for business owners to relocate their life&#x27;s work. The lasting ramifications of the highway construction are still felt by the black business sector in Detroit today.

The Oakland-Hastings Freeway, now called the I-375 Chrysler Highway, was laid directly along Hastings Street at the heart of the Black Bottom business district, and cut through the Lower East Side and Paradise Valley. To construct the Edsel Ford Expressway (I-94), more than 2,800 West Side and northern Paradise Valley buildings were demolished, including former jazz nightclubs, churches, community buildings, businesses and homes. The John C. Lodge Freeway mostly destroyed the Lower West Side, which also ran through black neighborhoods outside Twelfth Street and Highland Park.

A letter from a Mrs. Grace Black found in the Bentley Historical Library&#x27;s historical archives illustrates the struggles of finding housing with children amid the highway construction:Sept 1950Governor Williams:Please consider a family of 6 who are desperately in need of a house to rent. Husband, wife, and four lonely children, who have been turned down because we have children. We are now living in a house of the Edsel Ford Express Highway. We have our notice to move on out before the 23rd of Oct. So far we haven&#x27;t found a place to move. Nobody want to rent us because we have children. My children aren&#x27;t destructive but nobody will give us a chance to find out if they are or not. We are so comfortable here. It&#x27;s the first freedom we&#x27;ve enjoyed since we&#x27;ve had children. My husband work at children&#x27;s hospital only mak $60 a week. Sixty dollars we are paying $50 a month which we don&#x27;t mind because we are comfortable. This will be demolished if we were able we would buy this house. But are not. So if anything you can do will be appreciated from the depths of our hearts. You have done so much to help the lower income families. We are deeply grateful wishing you God&#x27;s speed. This is urgent! Please give this your immediate consideration.Thank youMrs. Grace Black (a worried mother)

I-75, Ford Field, and Comerica Park now occupy most of the area where Paradise Valley once stood. Historian Thomas Sugrue notes that of the families displaced by the razing of the Paradise Valley neighborhood:

{{blockquote|[A]bout one-third of the Gratiot-area&#x27;s families eventually moved to public housing, but 35 percent of the families in the area could not be traced. The best-informed city officials believed that a majority of families moved to neighborhoods within a mile of the Gratiot site, crowding into an already decaying part of the city, and finding houses scarcely better and often more overcrowded than that which they had left.}}

==== Detroit riots ====

The Detroit Race Riot of 1943 broke out in Detroit in June of that year and lasted three days before Federal troops regained control. The rioting between blacks and whites began on Belle Isle, Detroit&#x27;s largest park, on June 20, 1943, and continued until June 22, killing 34, wounding 433, and destroying property valued at $2 million. This was one of Detroit&#x27;s worst riots, with the buildup of racial tension and animosity between blacks and whites culminating in brawls that broke out on the bridge connecting Belle Isle to southeast Detroit. Fierce attacks were launched on each other&#x27;s property, including the looting of both black and white-owned stores and white rampages throughout Paradise Valley, a segregated section of Detroit that was predominantly black and very poorly maintained.

As racial tensions escalated between blacks and whites, the gravity of the consequences of these tensions also escalated. Violence and riots were common, especially regarding housing situations, as blacks began encroaching on predominantly white neighborhoods. In 1955, the black Wilson family bought a home in a white neighborhood, and soon faced vandalism and property destruction. Angry demands and threats were made at the Wilson family, harassing them to move out. Again, the Detroit police officers rarely did anything to help, choosing instead to sit in their cars nearby despite the constant harassment of the Wilsons.

The summer of 1967 saw five days of riots in Detroit. Forty-three people died, 33 were black, and ten were white. There were 467 injured: 182 civilians, 167 Detroit police officers, 83 Detroit firefighters, 17 National Guard troops, 16 State Police officers, and three U.S. Army soldiers. In the riots, 2,509 stores were looted or burned, 388 families were rendered homeless or displaced, and 412 buildings were burned or damaged enough to be demolished. Dollar losses from arson and looting ranged from $40 million to $80 million.

==== Economic and social fallout of the 1967 riots ====

After the riots, thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods, and the affected district lay in ruins for decades.

Of the 1967 riots, politician Coleman Young, Detroit&#x27;s first black mayor, wrote in 1994:

{{blockquote|The heaviest casualty, however, was the city. Detroit&#x27;s losses went a hell of a lot deeper than the immediate toll of lives and buildings. The riot put Detroit on the fast track to economic desolation, mugging the city and making off with incalculable value in jobs, earnings taxes, corporate taxes, retail dollars, sales taxes, mortgages, interest, property taxes, development dollars, investment dollars, tourism dollars, and plain damn money. The money was carried out in the pockets of the businesses and the people who fled as fast as they could. The white exodus from Detroit had been prodigiously steady prior to the riot, totally twenty-two thousand in 1966, but afterward, it was frantic. In 1967, with less than half the year remaining after the summer explosion, the outward population migration reached sixty-seven thousand. In 1968 the figure hit eighty-thousand, followed by forty-six thousand in 1969.}}

According to the economist Thomas Sowell:

{{blockquote|1=Before the ghetto riot of 1967, Detroit&#x27;s black population had the highest rate of home-ownership of any black urban population in the country, and their unemployment rate was just 3.4 percent. It was not despairing that fueled the riot. It was the riot which marked the beginning of the decline of Detroit to its current state of despair. Detroit&#x27;s population today is only half of what it once was, and its most productive people have been the ones who fled.}}

However, Thomas Sugrue argues that over 20% of Detroit&#x27;s adult black population was out of work in the 1950s and 1960s, along with 30% of black youth between eighteen and twenty-four.

Economist Edward L. Glaeser believes the riots were a symptom of the city&#x27;s already downward trajectory:

{{blockquote|1=While the 1967 riots are seen as a turning point in the city&#x27;s fortunes, Detroit&#x27;s decline began in the 1950s, during which the city lost almost a tenth of its population. Powerful historical forces buffeted Detroit&#x27;s single-industry economy, and Detroit&#x27;s federally supported comeback strategies did little to help.}}

State and local governments responded to the riot with a dramatic increase in minority hiring, including the State Police hiring blacks for the first time, and Detroit more than doubling the number of black police. The Michigan government used its reviews of contracts issued by the state to secure an increase in nonwhite employment. Between August 1967 and the end of the 1969–1970 fiscal year, minority group employment by the contracted companies increased by 21.1 percent.

In the aftermath of the riot, the Greater Detroit Board of Commerce launched a campaign to find jobs for ten thousand &quot;previously unemployable&quot; persons, a preponderant number of whom were black. By October 12, 1967, Detroit firms had reportedly hired about five thousand African-Americans since the beginning of the jobs campaign. According to Sidney Fine, &quot;that figure may be an underestimate.&quot;

The &quot;Michigan Historical Review&quot; writes that &quot;Just as the riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. facilitated the passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1968, which included fair housing, so the Detroit riot of July 1967, &#x27;the worst racial disturbance&#x27; of the century to that time, provided the impetus for the passage of Michigan&#x27;s fair housing law as well as similar measures in many Michigan communities.&quot; Other laws passed in response to the disorder included &quot;important relocation, tenants&#x27; rights, and code enforcement legislation&quot;. Governor Romney had made such proposals throughout the 1960s, but the opposition did not collapse until after the riot.

====1970s and 1980s====

The 1970 census showed that white people still comprised most of Detroit&#x27;s population. However, by the 1980 census, white people had fled at such a large rate that the city had gone from 55 percent to 34 percent white within a decade. The decline was even starker than this suggests, considering that when Detroit&#x27;s population reached its all-time high in 1950, the city was 83 percent white.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

Economist Walter E. Williams writes that the decline was sparked by the policies of Mayor Young, who Williams claims discriminated against whites. By contrast, urban affairs experts largely blame federal court decisions that decided against NAACP lawsuits and refused to challenge the legacy of housing and school segregation – particularly the case of &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot;, which was appealed up to the Supreme Court.

The District Court in &quot;Milliken&quot; had initially ruled that it was necessary to actively desegregate Detroit and its suburban communities in one comprehensive program. The city was ordered to submit a &quot;metropolitan&quot; plan that would eventually encompass fifty-four separate school districts, busing Detroit children to suburban schools and suburban children into Detroit. The Supreme Court reversed this in 1974. In his dissent, Justice William O. Douglas&#x27; argued that the majority&#x27;s decision perpetuated &quot;restrictive covenants&quot; that &quot;maintained ... black ghettos&quot;.

Gary Orfield and Susan E. Eaton wrote that the &quot;Suburbs were protected from desegregation by the courts, ignoring the origin of their racially segregated housing patterns.&quot; John Mogk, an expert in urban planning at Wayne State University in Detroit, has said that &quot;Everybody thinks that it was the riots [in 1967] that caused the white families to leave. Some people were leaving at that time but, really, it was after &quot;Milliken&quot; that you saw a mass flight to the suburbs. If the case had gone the other way, it is likely that Detroit would not have experienced the steep decline in its tax base that has occurred since then.&quot; Myron Orfield, director of the Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity at the University of Minnesota, has said:

{{blockquote|&quot;Milliken&quot; was perhaps the greatest missed opportunity of that period. Had that gone the other way, it would have opened the door to fixing nearly all of Detroit&#x27;s current problems ... A deeply segregated city is kind of a hopeless problem. It becomes more and more troubled and there are fewer and fewer solutions.}}

The departure of middle-class whites left blacks in control of a city suffering from an inadequate tax base, too few jobs, and swollen welfare rolls. According to Chafets, &quot;Among the nation&#x27;s major cities, Detroit was at or near the top of unemployment, poverty per capita, and infant mortality throughout the 1980s.&quot;

Detroit became notorious for violent crime in the 1970s and 1980s. Dozens of violent black street gangs gained control of the city&#x27;s large drug trade, which began with the heroin epidemic of the 1970s and grew into the larger crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s. Numerous major criminal gangs were founded in Detroit, dominating the drug trade at various times, though most were short-lived. They included The Errol Flynns (east side), Nasty Flynns (later the NF Bangers) and Black Killers and the drug consortiums of the 1980s such as Young Boys Inc., Pony Down, Best Friends, Black Mafia Family and the Chambers Brothers. The Young Boys were innovative, opening franchises in other cities, using youth too young to be prosecuted, promoting brand names, and unleashing extreme brutality to frighten away rivals.

Several times during the 1970s and 1980s, Detroit was named the &quot;arson capital of America&quot;, and the city was also repeatedly dubbed the &quot;murder capital of America&quot;. Detroit was frequently listed by FBI crime statistics as the &quot;most dangerous city in America&quot; during this time frame. Crime rates in Detroit peaked in 1991 at more than 2,700 violent crimes per 100,000 people. Population decline left abandoned buildings behind that became magnets for the drug trade, arson, and other criminal activity. The city&#x27;s criminality has pushed tourism away from the city, and several foreign countries even issued travel warnings for the city.

Around this period, in the days of the year preceding and including Halloween, Detroit citizens went on a rampage called &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot;. A tradition of light-hearted minor vandalism, such as soaping windows, had emerged in the 1930s, but by the 1980s, it had become, said Mayor Young, &quot;a vision from hell.&quot; During the height of the drug era, Detroit residents routinely set fire to houses that were known as popular drug-dealing locations, accusing the city&#x27;s police of being either unwilling or unable to solve the deep problems of the city.

The arson primarily occurred in the inner city, but surrounding suburbs were also often affected. The crimes became increasingly destructive throughout this period. Over 800 fires were set, mostly to vacant houses, in the peak year of 1984, overwhelming the city&#x27;s fire department. In later years, the arsons continued, but the frequency of these fires was reduced by razing thousands of abandoned houses and buildings that were often used to sell drugs. Five thousand of these buildings were razed in 1989–90 alone. The city mobilizes &quot;Angel&#x27;s Night&quot; every year, with tens of thousands of volunteers patrolling high-risk areas.

===Problems===

====Urban decay====

Detroit has experienced significant urban decay—the process in which a previously flourishing city falls into disuse and disrepair, characterized commonly by empty plots of land, abandoned, decrepit, and often vandalized buildings, high unemployment rates, and high crime rates. Detroit has become one of the most infamous examples of such cities in the United States. Abandoned residential and commercial buildings are widespread; in 2014, 30% of residential buildings in the city were partially or fully vacant. The problem is so severe that the city has been likened to a ghost town. In the 1940s, Detroit was the fourth-largest city in the U.S. thanks in large part to the automobile industry. Vehicle manufacturers Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler had their factories there, which made the city a source of employment for many people. In the 1950s, the industry was no longer confined to Detroit; it began to spread out when vehicle manufacturers began to move their factories elsewhere, which led to the old factories being closed and abandoned, and eventually, many of them were vandalized. This was a side effect of automation and globalization.

While improvements have been made, blight remains specifically in predominantly African American neighborhoods. A significant percentage of housing parcels in the city are vacant, with abandoned lots making up more than half of total residential lots in large portions of the city. With at least 70,000 abandoned buildings, 31,000 empty houses, and 90,000 vacant lots, Detroit has become notorious for its urban blight.

In 2010, Mayor Bing proposed a plan to bulldoze one-fourth of the city. Detroit is a metropolis that sprawls 139 square miles. In comparison, Manhattan is just over 22 square miles. The sprawling nature of the city is conducive to urban decay. The mayor planned to concentrate Detroit&#x27;s remaining population into specific areas to improve the delivery of essential city services, which the city has had significant difficulty providing (policing, fire protection, trash removal, snow removal, lighting, etc.). In February 2013, the Detroit Free Press reported the Mayor&#x27;s plan to accelerate the program. The project has hopes &quot;for federal funding to replicate it [the bulldozing plan] across the city to tackle Detroit&#x27;s problems with tens of thousands of abandoned and blighted homes and buildings.&quot; Bing said the project aims &quot;to right-size the city&#x27;s resources to reflect its smaller population.&quot; Despite this, there is still an estimated 20 square miles of empty land within the city limits.

The average price of homes sold in Detroit in 2012 was $7,500. As of January 2013, 47 houses in Detroit were listed for $500 or less, with five properties listed for $1. Despite the extremely low price of Detroit properties, most of the properties have been on the market for more than a year as the boarded-up, abandoned houses of the city are seldom attractive to buyers. The Detroit News reported that more than half of Detroit property owners did not pay taxes in 2012, at a loss to the city of $131 million (equal to 12% of the city&#x27;s general fund budget).

The first comprehensive analysis of the city&#x27;s tens of thousands of abandoned and dilapidated buildings took place in the spring of 2014. It found that around 50,000 of the city&#x27;s 261,000 structures were abandoned, with over 9,000 structures bearing fire damage. It further recommended the demolition of 5,000 of these structures.  

Between 2000 and 2010, Detroit lost a quarter of its population. More people left Detroit during this time—237,500—than fled New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina—140,000. However, from 2010 to 2018, Detroit saw the biggest growth in racial diversity of any city analyzed by a US news study. This is not the racial diversity most other cities experienced. Opposite of the white flight most cities experienced, where whites fled cities for safer suburbs, Detroit saw an influx of white residents into the downtown and midtown areas. The Midtown and downtown areas have increasing population density, while African American neighborhoods remain without good access to public services. The city&#x27;s poverty rate remains several times higher than the national average.

====Population decline====
{{see also|Demographic history of Detroit}}

Historically a major population center, Detroit has undergone a considerable reduction in population, losing over 60% of its population since 1950. Detroit reached its population peak in the 1950 census at over 1.8 million people, and its population has decreased in each subsequent census. As of the 2010 census, the city has just over 700,000 residents, a total loss of 61% of its 1950 population.

The vast majority of this population loss was due to Detroit&#x27;s deindustrialization, which moved factories from the inner city to the suburbs. This was coupled with the phenomenon of white flight, the movement of many white families from urban areas of metro Detroit to the suburbs on the city&#x27;s outskirts. White flight was spurred on by the Great Migration, in which hundreds of thousands of blacks migrated from the South to Detroit in search of employment. This caused overcrowding in the inner city and led to racial housing segregation. Practices of redlining, mortgage discrimination, and racially restrictive covenants in Detroit further contributed to the overcrowding of certain minority groups residing in subsections of Detroit, such as Black Bottom. Many of the white residents of Detroit did not wish to integrate with their black counterparts. They often chose to flee the city and reside in racially homogenous suburban neighbourhoods. This was also a result of an increased desire for homeownership. A report, &quot;The Population Revolution in Detroit&quot;, published in February 1963 by Wayne State University sociologist Albert J. Mayer, suggested flight to the suburbs was grounded as much in economics as race: &quot;Present population trends clearly demonstrate that the city is, by and large, being abandoned by all except those who suffer from relatively great ... deprivations.&quot; White families were in better positions to relocate into the suburbs, in juxtaposition with blacks who faced discrimination in home loans and in the real estate market.

Highway construction post-WWII also contributed to white flight, specifically with the construction of the Interstate Highway System. This allowed white families to commute to work in the city from the suburbs easily and incentivized many white Detroiters to relocate thus. The construction of highways in Detroit further exacerbated the pre-existing racial segregation, as government officials built highways through areas that were seen as blighted – typically black &quot;ghettos&quot; – that were under-financed and under-maintained.

As a result of white flight and mass migration to the suburbs, a significant change in the racial composition of Detroit occurred. From 1950 to 2010, the black/white population percentage went from 16.2%/83.6% to 82.7%/10.6%. Approximately 1,400,000 of the 1,600,000 white people in Detroit after World War II left the city for the suburbs. Beginning in the 1980s, for the first time in its history, Detroit was a majority-black city.

This drastic racial demographic change resulted in more than a change in neighborhood appearance. It had political, social, and economic effects as well. In 1974, Detroit elected its first black mayor, Coleman Young. Coleman Young aimed to create a racially diverse cabinet and police force, half black and half white members, leading to a new face representing Detroit on the global stage.

Most important, however, was the population decline&#x27;s negative effect on Detroit&#x27;s economy. Following the population decline, Detroit&#x27;s tax revenue significantly decreased. The government was receiving less revenue from taxpayers residing in the city which led to more foreclosures and overall unemployment, eventually culminating in the bankruptcy of 2013.

Detroit&#x27;s population continues to decline today, impacting its majority poor, black demographic the hardest. Because urban renewal, highway construction, and discriminatory loan policies contributed to white flight to the suburbs, the remaining poor, black city population endured radical disinvestment and a lack of public services such as dilapidated schools, a lack of safety, blighted properties, and waste, contributing the reality of families living in the city today. Furthermore, Detroit has the highest property tax of any major U.S. city, making it difficult for many families to afford to live there.

White flight does appear to be reversing starting in the 1990s, with affluent white families returning to the city and gentrifying areas of urban decay and blight. However, this has caused many physical and cultural displacement issues, disproportionately impacting marginalized minority communities. Real estate development and the overall &quot;improvement&quot; of the city lead to increased rent in those parts of the city. Since marginalized communities tend to be more impoverished, they cannot financially support these increased rent levels and are physically displaced. Following physical displacement, there is also the issue of cultural displacement, as gentrification causes a loss of sense of belonging, ownership, history, identity and pride associated with living in a particular place.

Data does show that Detroit&#x27;s population loss is slowing. The decrease in 2017 was 2,376 residents compared to the 2016 decline of 2,770. The city has yet to rebound to the heights of population growth of the 1950s, but the decline is indeed slowing.

As of 2021, the population declined further to 630,000.

====Social issues====

=====Unemployment=====

According to the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate is 8.3% {{as of|2017|October|lc=y}}. 
In the 20th century, the unemployment rate was around 5%, according to the U.S. Department of Labor&#x27;s archives.

=====Poverty=====

The U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s &quot;Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012&quot; ranks Detroit first among all 71 U.S. cities for which rates were calculated in percentage of the city&#x27;s population living below the poverty level. The individual rate living below the poverty level is 36.4%; the family rate is 31.3%.

=====Crime=====
{{main|Crime in Detroit}}

Detroit has some of the highest crime rates in the United States, with a rate of 62.18 per 1,000 residents for property crimes and 16.73 per 1,000 for violent crimes (compared to national figures of 32 per 1,000 for property crimes and 5 per 1,000 for violent crime in 2008). Detroit&#x27;s murder rate was 53 per 100,000 in 2012, ten times that of New York City. A 2012 Forbes report named Detroit the most dangerous city in the United States for the fourth year in a row, citing an FBI survey data that found that the city&#x27;s metropolitan area had a significant rate of violent crimes: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.

According to Detroit officials in 2007, about 65 to 70 percent of homicides in the city were drug-related. The rate of unsolved murders in the city is roughly 70%.

==== City finances ====
{{main|Detroit bankruptcy}}

On March 1, 2013, Governor Rick Snyder announced that the state would be assuming financial control of the city. A team was chosen to review the city&#x27;s finances and determine whether the appointment of an emergency manager was warranted. Two weeks later, the state&#x27;s Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board (ELB) appointed an emergency financial manager, Kevyn Orr. Orr released his first report in mid-May. The results were generally negative regarding Detroit&#x27;s financial health. The report said that Detroit is &quot;clearly insolvent on a cash flow basis.&quot; The report said that Detroit would finish its current budget year with a $162 million cash-flow shortfall and that the projected budget deficit was expected to reach $386 million in less than two months. The report said that costs for retiree benefits were eating up a third of Detroit&#x27;s budget and that public services were suffering as Detroit&#x27;s revenues and population shrink each year. The report was not intended to offer a complete blueprint for Orr&#x27;s plans for fixing the crisis; more details about those plans were expected to emerge within a few months.

After several months of negotiations, Orr was ultimately unable to come to a deal with Detroit&#x27;s creditors, unions, and pension boards and therefore filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection in the Eastern District of Michigan U.S. Bankruptcy Court on July 18, 2013, the largest U.S. city ever to do so, with outstanding financial obligations to more than 100,000 creditors totaling approximately $18.5 billion. On December 10, 2014, Detroit successfully exited bankruptcy.

===Resurgence===
By the late 2010s, many observers, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, pointed to Detroit&#x27;s economic and cultural resurgence. This resurgence was primarily due to private and public investment revitalizing the city&#x27;s social and economic dynamics. Detroit has achieved a renewed sense of interest through reinvestment and revamped social policies. It serves as a model for other areas to learn how to re-energize their urban centers. In 2024, the United States Census Bureau reported that Detroit experienced a slight population increase in its 2023 estimates, marking the city&#x27;s first recorded growth since 1957.

Evidence of Detroit&#x27;s resurgence is most readily found in the Midtown Area and the Central Business District, which have attracted a number of high-profile investors. Most notably, Dan Gilbert has heavily invested in the acquisition and revitalization of a number of historic buildings in the Downtown area. A primary focus of private real estate investment has been to position Detroit&#x27;s Central Business District as an attractive site for the investment of technology companies such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.{{Citation needed|reason=Amazon publicly outlined reasons for avoiding Detroit as a location for HQ2.|date=October 2021}} Approaches to the private investment of Midtown, however, have prioritized re-establishing Midtown as the cultural and commercial center of the city. Midtown Cultural Connection&#x27;s &quot;DIA Plaza Project&quot;, for instance, aims to unify the city&#x27;s cultural district—which includes the Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit Public Library, the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, and several other institutions—by constructing a public space that creates a sense of inclusion and harmony with the rest of the city. Public transportation within the Downtown area has also been a target for private investors, as evidenced by Quicken Loans&#x27; investment in Detroit&#x27;s QLine railcar, which currently runs a {{convert|3.3|mi}} track along Woodward Avenue.

Gilbert&#x27;s investment within the city is not limited to real estate; he has also assembled a security force that patrols the downtown area and monitors hundreds of security centers attached to buildings operated by his own Rock Ventures. These agents have eyes on almost every corner of downtown Detroit and coordinate public safety and monitor legal infractions in partnership with Wayne State University&#x27;s private police agency and Detroit&#x27;s own police force. In addition to these efforts to revitalize Detroit&#x27;s social atmosphere, Gilbert and Quicken Loans have cultivated a strong and diverse workforce within Detroit by incentivizing employees to live in Midtown and offering subsidies and loans. Through such initiatives, Gilbert has focused on &quot;creating opportunity&quot; for Detroiters and encouraged reinvestment within the city&#x27;s economy.

However, the approach many of these private investors have taken within the downtown area has been criticized. Many have argued that the influx of private capital into Downtown Detroit has resulted in dramatic changes to the social and socio-economic character of the city. Some claim that investors like Gilbert are converting Detroit into an oligarchical city whose redevelopment is controlled by only a few powerful figures. Residents have even referred to the downtown area as &quot;Gilbertville&quot; and expressed fears of physical displacement due to the rent increase that results from such investments. Additionally, many long-time residents fear that the influx of new capital could result in their political disempowerment and that the city government will become less responsive to their needs if it is under the influence of outside investors.

Other investors, such as John Hantz, are attempting to revitalize Detroit using another approach: urban agriculture. Unlike Gilbert, Hantz has focused on the blighted neighborhoods in Detroit&#x27;s residential zones. In 2008, Hantz approached Detroit&#x27;s city government and proposed a plan to remove urban blight by demolishing blighted homes and planting trees to establish a large urban farm. Despite fervent criticisms on behalf of city residents claiming that Hantz&#x27;s proposal amounted to nothing more than a &quot;land grab&quot;, the city government eventually approved Hantz&#x27;s proposal, granting him nearly {{convert|140|acres}} of land. As of 2017, Hantz Farms has planted over 24,000 saplings and demolished 62 blighted structures. Still, it remains to be seen what Hantz&#x27;s long-term ambitions are for the project, and many residents speculate future developments on his land.

Detroit&#x27;s resurgence is also being driven by the formation of public-private-nonprofit partnerships that protect and maintain Detroit&#x27;s most valuable assets. The Detroit Riverfront, for instance, is maintained and developed almost exclusively through nonprofit funding in partnership with public and private enterprises. This model for economic development and revitalization has seen enormous success in Detroit, with the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy raising in excess of $23 million to revitalize and maintain riverfront assets. This model for economic development is so promising that the city has turned to similar partnership strategies to manage, maintain, and revitalize several other city assets.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Over the past seventy years, the city of Detroit has experienced a dramatic reduction in its population and economic well-being. This decline has left countless community members in economic turmoil, driving many residents to fall behind on taxes and subject their homes to tax foreclosure. Due to the overassessment of property values based on outdated appraisals, the property taxes on these homes are massively inflated, perpetuating further property foreclosure and community displacement. These foreclosed properties are often turned over to a public auction, where many of them are purchased by wealthy investors looking to take advantage of Detroit&#x27;s housing market.

Proponents of such investment argue that wealthy investors have minimized displacement by redeveloping vacant areas where people did not reside; however, this kind of investment can have additional repercussions beyond residents&#x27; physical and economic displacement. In recent years, researchers have begun considering the impacts of gentrification and radical reinvestment on a city&#x27;s culture. In the case of Detroit, they argue that private investment directly leads to a sense of &quot;cultural displacement&quot;, causing long-time residents to lose &quot;a sense of place and community&quot; and &quot;may feel like their community is less their own than it used to be.&quot; Although economic reinvestment provides jobs, opportunities, and capital for the city, opponents to this agenda assert that it is just a form of &quot;disaster capitalism&quot; and only benefits the wealthy without including Detroit residents, who have been disproportionately marginalized and excluded from progressive efforts for decades. They fear rising property values and taxes in surrounding areas will adversely impact existing populations and result in a new form of existential displacement.

In 2015, a group of activists started a community land trust, or CLT, to combat this housing crisis by providing community-controlled affordable housing while promoting economic development. The movement to implement CLTs in Detroit began with several meetings held by the Building Movement Project. A nonprofit organization, Storehouse of Hope, created a GoFundMe campaign to purchase fifteen homes, which became a part of the CLT. The CLT ensures housing stability and helps residents overcome financial hardship by covering the costs of property taxes, insurance, building repairs and water bills. The residents pay one-third of their income in rent to the CLT. Sales caps are also placed on the properties of the CLT to maintain affordability for generations of future buyers.

Most of the skepticism surrounding CLTs is rooted in their reliance on external funding. As CLT organizations grow and their boards become more professionalized, they are often distanced from their original ideals of community-based land control which the organizations were founded upon. Most CLTs are not built upon economically self-sustaining models, so they are forced to compete for external funding, taking away the CLT&#x27;s autonomy, as all of the power is transferred into the hands of grant-funding organizations and private foundations. This problem could be avoided if CLTs could somehow source their funding from community investors or funders who share their ideals of community empowerment.

==Metropolitan region==
The Detroit area emerged as a major metropolitan region with the construction of an extensive freeway system in the 1950s and 1960s, which expanded in the ensuing decades. The 1950s, 60s, and 70s witnessed an expansion of the cultural phenomenon of U.S. muscle cars, including Camaro, Mustang, and Charger. Automotive designers and business executives such as Bill Mitchell, Lee Iacocca, and John DeLorean rose to prominence for their contributions. Freeways facilitated movement throughout the region, with millions residing in the suburbs. A desire for newer housing and schools accelerated migration from the city to the suburbs.{{According to whom|date=June 2023}} Commensurate with the population shift and jobs to its suburbs, the city has had to adjust its role within the larger metropolitan area. Downtown Detroit has seen a resurgence in the 21st century as a business center and entertainment hub, with three casino resort hotels opening. In 1940, Detroit held about one-third of the state&#x27;s population, while the metropolitan region currently has roughly one-half of the state&#x27;s population. For the 2010 census, the city of Detroit&#x27;s population was 713,777, while metropolitan Detroit&#x27;s combined statistical area had a population of 5,218,852. The city completed significant revitalizations through the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century. Immigration continues to play a role in the region&#x27;s projected growth, with the population of Detroit-Ann Arbor-Flint (CMSA) estimated to be estimated to be 6,191,000 by 2025.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

==21st century==

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city began to experience a revival, much of it centered in Downtown, Midtown, and New Center. After purchasing and renovating the historic Fox Theatre and Fox Office Centre in 1987, Mike Ilitch and Marian Ilitch moved Little Caesars Pizza&#x27;s headquarters to Downtown Detroit. One Detroit Center (1993) arose on the city skyline. Newer downtown residents are predominantly young professionals. The city has three casino resort hotels—MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino, and Hollywood Casino—with one of the larger gaming industry markets in the U.S. New downtown stadiums Comerica Park and Ford Field were constructed for the Detroit Tigers and Detroit Lions in 2000 and 2002, respectively; this placed the Lions&#x27; stadium in the city proper for the first time since 1974. Opened in 2017, Little Caesars Arena allows the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Pistons to have a shared home, thus locating the Pistons&#x27; in the city proper for the first time since 1978, also making Detroit the only North American city to have all major professional sports based in its downtown. In 2008, the city witnessed grand restorations of the historic Book Cadillac Hotel and the Fort Shelby Hotel. The city has hosted major sporting events—the 2005 MLB All-Star Game, 2006 Super Bowl XL, 2006 World Series, WrestleMania 23 in 2007 and the NCAA Final Four in April 2009—all of which prompted many improvements to the area.



The city&#x27;s International Riverfront is a focus of much development, which has complemented similar developments in Windsor, Ontario. In 2007, Detroit completed the first major portions of the River Walk, including miles of parks and fountains. The Renaissance Center received a major renovation in 2004. New developments and revitalizations are a mainstay in the city&#x27;s plan to enhance its economy through tourism. Along the river, upscale condominiums are rising, such as Watermark Detroit. Some city limit signs, particularly on the Dearborn border, say &quot;Welcome to Detroit, The Renaissance City Founded 1701&quot;.

In 2004, Compuware established its world headquarters in downtown Detroit followed by Quicken Loans in 2010. Significant landmarks such as the Fox Theatre, Orchestra Hall Detroit Opera House, and the Gem Theater have been restored and host concerts, musicals, and plays. The Detroit Institute of Arts completed a major renovation and expansion in 2007. Many downtown centers, such as Greektown, Cobo Center and Campus Martius Park, draw patrons and host activities.

In September 2008, Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick (who had served for six years) resigned following felony convictions. In 2013, Kilpatrick was convicted on 24 federal felony counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and racketeering, and was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison.

In July 2013, Michigan state-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr asked a federal judge to place the City of Detroit into bankruptcy protection.

In March 2014, the indebted Detroit Water and Sewerage Department began cutting off water to customers&#x27; homes with unpaid bills over $150 or if the payment was over 60 days overdue. As of July 15, more than 15,000 homes had been cut off.

Campus Martius, a reconfiguration of downtown&#x27;s main intersection as a new park, was opened in 2004. The park has been cited as one of the best public spaces in the United States. In 2001, the first portion of the International Riverfront redevelopment was completed as a part of the city&#x27;s 300th-anniversary celebration.

In September 2008, Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick (who had served for six years) resigned following felony convictions. In 2013, Kilpatrick was convicted on 24 federal felony counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and racketeering, and was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison. The former mayor&#x27;s activities cost the city an estimated $20 million. Roughly half of the owners of Detroit&#x27;s 305,000 properties failed to pay their 2011 tax bills, resulting in about $246 million (~${{Format price|{{Inflation|index=US-GDP|value=246000000|start_year=2011}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}) in taxes and fees going uncollected, nearly half of which was due to Detroit. The rest of the money would have been earmarked for Wayne County, Detroit Public Schools, and the library system.

The city&#x27;s financial crisis resulted in Michigan taking over administrative control of its government. Governor Rick Snyder declared a financial emergency in March 2013, stating the city had a $327 million budget deficit and faced more than $14 billion in long-term debt. It had been making ends meet on a month-to-month basis with the help of bond money held in a state escrow account and had instituted mandatory unpaid days off for many city workers. Those troubles, along with underfunded city services, such as police and fire departments, and ineffective turnaround plans from Mayor Bing and the City Council led the state of Michigan to appoint an emergency manager for Detroit. On June 14, 2013, Detroit defaulted on $2.5 billion of debt by withholding $39.7 million in interest payments, while Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr met with bondholders and other creditors in an attempt to restructure the city&#x27;s $18.5 billion debt and avoid bankruptcy. On July 18, 2013, Detroit became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy. It was declared bankrupt by U.S. District Court on December 3, with its $18.5 billion debt. On November 7, 2014, the city&#x27;s plan for exiting bankruptcy was approved. On December 11 the city officially exited bankruptcy. The plan allowed the city to eliminate $7 billion in debt and invest $1.7 billion into improved city services.

One way the city obtained this money was through the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA). Holding over 60,000 pieces of art worth billions of dollars, some saw it as the key to funding this investment. The city came up with a plan to monetize the art and sell it, leading to the DIA becoming a private organization. After months of legal battles, the city finally got hundreds of millions of dollars towards funding a new Detroit.

=== 2010s and revitalization ===
One of the largest post-bankruptcy efforts to improve city services has been to fix the city&#x27;s broken street lighting system. At one time it was estimated that 40% of lights were not working, which resulted in public safety issues and abandonment of housing. The plan called for replacing outdated high-pressure sodium lights with 65,000 LED lights. Construction began in late 2014 and finished in December 2016; Detroit is the largest U.S. city with all LED street lighting.

In the 2010s, several initiatives were taken by Detroit&#x27;s citizens and new residents to improve the cityscape by renovating and revitalizing neighborhoods. Such projects include volunteer renovation groups and various urban gardening movements. Miles of associated parks and landscaping have been completed in recent years. In 2011, the Port Authority Passenger Terminal opened, with the riverwalk connecting Hart Plaza to the Renaissance Center.

One symbol of the city&#x27;s decades-long decline, the Michigan Central Station, was long vacant. The city renovated it with new windows, elevators and facilities, completing the work in December 2015. In 2018, Ford Motor Company purchased the building and plans to use it for mobility testing with a potential return of train service. Several other landmark buildings have been privately renovated and adapted as condominiums, hotels, offices, or for cultural uses. Detroit was mentioned as a city of renaissance and has reversed many of the trends of the prior decades.

The city has seen a rise in gentrification. In downtown, for example, the construction of Little Caesars Arena brought with it high class shops and restaurants along Woodward Avenue. Office tower and condominium construction has led to an influx of wealthy families but also a displacement of long-time residents and culture. Areas outside of downtown and other recently revived areas have an average household income of about 25% less than the gentrified areas, a gap that is continuing to grow. Rents and cost of living in these gentrified areas rise every year, pushing minorities and the poor out, causing more and more racial disparity and separation in the city. In 2019, the cost of a one-bedroom loft in Rivertown reached $300,000 (~${{Format price|{{Inflation|index=US-GDP|value=300000|start_year=2019}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}), with a five-year sale price change of over 500% and average income rising by 18%.{{Better source needed|date=September 2024}}

<doc id="1243001" wikidata="Q25244" url="?curid=1243001" title="10th Dalai Lama">
<text>The 10th Dalai Lama, Tsultrim Gyatso (full given name Ngawang Lobzang Jampel Tsultrim Gyatso (ngag dbang blo bzang &#x27;jam dpal tshul khrims rgya mtsho) or Tsultrim Gyatso (25 or 26 May 1816 – 30 September 1837) was the 10th Dalai Lama of Tibet, and born in Litang, Kham. He was fully ordained in the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, studied the sutras and tantras, had several students, and rebuilt the Potala Palace.

Tsultrim Gyatso was born to a modest family known as Drongto Norbutsang (&quot;grong stod nor bu tshang&quot;) in Lithang, Kham, Tibet. His father was Lobzang Nyendrak (&quot;blo bzang snyan grags&quot;) and his mother was Namgyel Butri (&quot;rnam rgyal bu khrid&quot;). The 9th Dalai Lama Lungtok Gyatso had died in 1815, and five years passed before this incarnation was found. 

Tsultrim Gyatso was chosen from a field of six potential incarnates of the 9th Dalai Lama Lungtok Gyatso (&quot;ta la&#x27;i bla ma 09 lung rtogs rgya mtsho&quot;). Preferred as the best by the Tibetan oracle and government officials in 1820, he travelled to Lhasa in 1821 after which the Kalon (regent) Demo Ngawang Lobzang Tubten Jigme Gyatso died. The Qing emperor&#x27;s representatives (&quot;ambans&quot;) then insisted that their &quot;golden urn&quot; be used to confirm the incarnation, delaying the enthronement for a year.

During that year of delay, Tibetan historians state

The enthronement of the 10th Dalai Lama, Tsultrim Gyatso, was held at the Potala Palace on 23 September 1822, which is the eighth day of the eighth lunar month of the Water Horse Year.

Soon after his enthronement in 1822, the Dalai Lama received his pre-novice ordination from the Seventh Panchen Lama Lobzang Palden Tenpai Nyima (paN chen bla ma 04 blo bzang dpal ldan bstan pa&#x27;i nyi ma) and gave him the name Ngawang Lobzang Jampel Tsultrim Gyatso (ngag dbang blo bzang &#x27;jam dpal tshul khrims rgya mtsho). The following month he became a novice monk. His father received a title and the Yutok estate, which initiated a noble Tibetan family line. 

In 1825 in his 10th year, the Dalai Lama had many tutors and was enrolled at Drepung Monastery and studied both sutra and tantra. He likely studied at Ganden Monastery and Sera Monastery as well. He studied Tibetan Buddhist texts extensively during the rest of his life.

In 1830, the Dalai Lama was put in charge of the Tibetan state, and a report called the &quot;Iron-Tiger Report&quot; on agriculture and tax policies was prepared. In 1831 the Dalai Lama reconstructed the Potala Palace.
In 1834 the Dalai Lama gave teachings to the Fifth Kalkha and to the Mongolian King of Torgo, and sent senior monks to Mongolia to establish a Kalacakra center there.

The Dalai Lama set about to overhaul the economic structure of Tibet but did not live long enough to see his plans come to fruition. After becoming ill in 1834 during an epidemic breakout in Lhasa, the Dalai Lama received his full Gelong ordination from the Panchen Lama in his nineteenth year. He remained in poor health for three years and died in 1837.

Despite his death in his 22nd year, he was said to have had several students from Tibet and Bhutan. The 10th Dalai Lama&#x27;s body was installed in a golden reliquary in the Potala Palace called The Supreme Ornament of the Three Realms” (gser gdung khams gsum rgyan mchog).

<text>Nobuyuki Idei (出井 伸之, &quot;Idei Nobuyuki&quot;; 22 November 1937 – 2 June 2022) was a Japanese businessman. He was chairman and group chief executive officer of Sony Corporation until 7 March 2005. He was a director of General Motors, Baidu, Yoshimoto Kogyo and Nestlé.

== Early life ==
Idei was born in Tokyo on 22 November 1937. His father was a professor of economics at Waseda University, a private university in Tokyo.

== Career ==
Idei joined Sony Corporation when he graduated from Waseda University. He started as a trainee working with the co-founders Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka and rose through the ranks as a marketing specialist. He left Sony and enrolled in a PhD program at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, but he did not obtain the degree. Sony re-hired him and he was moved to Europe to manage Sony&#x27;s businesses in the continent.

After a stroke sidelined former chairman Akio Morita, Sony CEO and new chairman Norio Ohga selected Idei to be the next president, a choice that raised eyebrows at Sony. His sweeping reorganizations of the company included trimming the board of directors from 38 members dominated by company management to 10 with a substantial presence of outsiders. Already perceived as the company&#x27;s driving force, Idei was formally named co-CEO in 1998 and sole CEO in 1999. In 2000, while Ohga remained chairman of the board, Idei became executive chairman and Kunitake Andō became president.

In 2003, on Ohga&#x27;s retirement, Idei became the sole chairman, and the title of chief executive officer was altered to group chief executive officer. On 7 March 2005, it was announced that Idei would be succeeded on 22 June by Sir Howard Stringer.

In 2006, Idei joined the board leading Accenture. On 28 September 2011, Idei joined the board of directors of Lenovo.

Idei founded his own consulting firm Quantum Leaps Corporation on his retirement from Sony. He was also on the board of companies including General Motors and Baidu.

On 5 February 2015, Idei retired from Accenture&#x27;s board of directors.

== Personal life ==
Idei was married and had a daughter. He died on 2 June 2022 from liver failure. He was aged 84.

<doc id="1243007" wikidata="Q853318" url="?curid=1243007" title="Madagascar pochard">
<text>The Madagascar pochard or Madagascan pochard (Aythya innotata; ) is an extremely rare diving duck of the genus &quot;Aythya&quot;. Thought to be extinct in the late 1990s, specimens of the species were rediscovered at Lake Matsaborimena near Bemanevika in Madagascar in 2006. By 2017, a captive breeding program had produced a population of around 90 individuals. The birds were reintroduced to the wild in December 2018.

The Madagascar pochard feeds mainly on aquatic insects, unlike other diving ducks in the same genus, The population is small, fluctuating around 25 individuals, and mainly utilises two small volcanic lakes in the far north of Madagascar. 

&quot;Aythya&quot;. Ducklings begin making short dives at around 14 days old, before which they feed on the surface.

== Taxonomy ==
The Madagascar pochard was largely overlooked by scientists in the 19th century, as those that saw it assumed they were seeing ferruginous ducks instead. Even after its description in 1894 little notice was taken of the species, and even numbers are hard to gauge from early accounts of the species. Based on the accounts written by Webb and Delacour&#x27;s in the 1920s and 1930s it seemed that the bird was still relatively common at Lake Alaotra.

The Madagascar pochard is generally thought to be closely related to the Hardhead, Baer&#x27;s pochard and ferruginous duck. It is monotypic, having no described or known subspecies.

== Description ==
The pochard is a medium-sized duck between 42 and 56 centimeters in size. Juvenile ducks have brown irises and are a pale, dull brown or chestnut colour with a darker stomach. The adults are darker in colour, though during a male duck&#x27;s first winter, its iris will turn white. Breeding males have dark chestnut heads, chins, throats, breasts, and necks, with blackish brown on the top side of the body. Their wings are dark brown with a white bar. The area under the bodies from the stomach to the tail fades to white, as do the undersides of the wings. The beaks and legs are dark grey with black nails.

Vocalizations may include &quot;[when] in display [...] the male utters a cat-like &quot;wee-oow&quot; and a rolling &quot;rrr&quot;, while the female gives a harsh &quot;squak&quot;.&quot;

== Distribution and ecology ==
The species exclusively lives in inland wetlands in Madagascar, where it is endemic. Currently, the only wild populations are at Lake Sofia and Lake Matsaborimena.

Historically, the birds preferred shallow lakes and marshes with dense vegetation; however, the rediscovered population was found in a cold, deep crater lake that had few aquatic plants and was surrounded by heavy forest, and other remote crater lakes may have been inhabitable due to the birds&#x27; requirements for shallower water. Its previous habitat in the Lake Alaotra basin was disturbed by rice cultivation and invasive introduced fishes.

==Behaviour==
Madagascar pochards do not migrate, do not usually form flocks, and are usually found in pairs or as single ducks.

===Diet and feeding===
The Madagascar pochard spends 38% of its day feeding. The diet is dominated by aquatic insects; a study examining their faeces found that caddisflies were the most commonly found insect, followed by dragonfly larvae, bugs (Hemiptera) and flies from the family Chironomidae. Stable isotope analysis and the faecal studies have shown that their diet includes very little plant material, which is unusual when compared to their relatives in the genus &quot;Aythya&quot;.

The bird dives for much of its food, with a mean diving time of around 24 seconds. Ducklings feed on the surface until they are old enough to dive, at around 14 days, and make shorter dives once they do dive (around 10 seconds).

=== Breeding ===
Observers have noted nesting behaviour from July to February, sometimes with multiple attempts at nesting. Nests are found 20–40 cm above water, in the plants along the lake or marsh edges (noted in Cyperaceae), with 6 to 10 eggs per clutch.

==Relationship with humans==
===Decline===

The duck probably started to decline dramatically sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s. The cause of decline was the introduction of numerous fish species in the lake that killed most of the pochard chicks and damaged nesting sites. Adult birds are also likely to have become victims of introduced fishes. Rice cultivation, cattle grazing on the shores, burning of shore vegetation, introduced mammals (rats), gill-net fishing and hunting are all factors that led to the duck&#x27;s disappearance from the lake. The last record of multiple birds at Lake Alaotra is from 9 June 1960 when a small flock of about 20 birds was spotted on the lake. Despite the rarity of the species in 1960, a male was shot, and the specimen was held by the Zoological Museum Amsterdam, and later the Naturalis Biodiversity Center. There is a very dubious report of a sighting made outside Antananarivo in 1970.
===Rediscovery and reintroduction===
Before it was rediscovered in 2006, the last confirmed sighting of the species was at Lake Alaotra on the Central Plateau of Madagascar in 1991. The single male then encountered was captured and kept in the Antananarivo Botanical Gardens until it died one year later. Intensive searches and publicity campaigns in 1989–1990, 1993–1994 and 2000–2001 failed to produce any more records of this bird.

However, a flock of nine adults and four recently hatched ducklings were discovered at Lake Matsaborimena, in a remote area of northern Madagascar, in November 2006. Though their habitat was &quot;too deep and too cold for the pochards to thrive&quot;, it was one of the few wetlands on the island still capable of supporting the remaining few birds due to damage from pollution, invasive species, and agricultural practices in other wetlands. The species was placed in the new &quot;Possibly Extinct&quot; category in the 2006 IUCN Red List; following the rediscovery, its old status of Critically Endangered was restored in the 2007 issue. As of 2008, only 25 adult birds had been counted in the wild.

=== Conservation ===

In 2009, a rescue plan involving the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust removed a batch of ready-to-hatch eggs from a lake-side nest and incubated them in a lab that was set up in a tent beside the lake. After hatching, the day-old chicks were taken to a holding facility in a local hotel. By the end of 2009, the organizations, including The Peregrine Fund, collected three clutches for 24 eggs to hatch 23 ducklings in total. Reared in captivity, they hatched eighteen ducklings in April 2012 at the captive breeding centre in Antsohihy, bringing the total population to 60.

2011 marked the first chick to hatch from captive breeding efforts. In April 2013, the population reached 80. In Autumn 2017 the population reached 90, causing the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust to begin preparations for the reintroduction process at a suitable lake in Madagascar, Lake Sofia, including working with the communities surrounding the lake. In December 2018, 21 of the birds were released at Lake Sofia, where floating aviaries were installed to protect the birds.

<text>Doctors&#x27; Commons, also called the College of Civilians, was a society of lawyers practising civil (as opposed to common) law in London, namely ecclesiastical and admiralty law. Like the Inns of Court of the common lawyers, the society had buildings with rooms where its members lived and worked, and a large library.

It was also a lower venue for determinations and hearings, short of the society&#x27;s convening in the Court of the Arches or Admiralty Court, which frequently consisted of judges with other responsibilities and from which further appeal lay. The society used St Benet&#x27;s, Paul&#x27;s Wharf as its church.

==The civil law in England==

While the English common law, unlike the legal systems on the European continent, developed mostly independently from Roman law, some specialised English courts applied the Roman-based civil law. This is true of the ecclesiastical courts, whose practice even after the English Reformation continued to be based on the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church, and also of the admiralty courts. Until reforms in the 19th century, the ecclesiastical courts performed functions equivalent to today&#x27;s probate courts, subject then to appeals to separate courts (of equity), and family courts (however divorce was much harder to achieve).

The advocates practising in these courts had been trained in canon law (before the Reformation) and in Roman law (after) at the university colleges of Oxford and Cambridge. This profession was split, like its common law counterpart. The advocates (the doctors) were akin to barristers in the common-law courts, while the proctors were akin to attorneys in the common-law courts or to solicitors in the courts of equity.

According to some accounts, the society of Doctors&#x27; Commons was formed in 1511 by Richard Blodwell, Dean of the Arches. He served nine years. According to others, it existed in the previous century. The society&#x27;s buildings, acquired in 1567, were near St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral at Paternoster Row, and remained in use for many years; however, in the society&#x27;s final decades nearby buildings in Knightrider Street were used instead.

In 1768 the society was incorporated. It took official name of the &quot;College of Doctors of Law exercent in the Ecclesiastical and Admiralty Courts&quot;. The college still consisted of its president (the Dean of Arches) and of those doctors of law who, having taken that degree in the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, and having been admitted advocates in pursuance of the rescript of the archbishop of Canterbury, were elected &quot;fellows&quot; in the manner prescribed by the charter. There were also attached to the college thirty-four &quot;proctors&quot;, whose duties were analogous to those of solicitors.

==Disestablishment==
In the nineteenth century, Doctors&#x27; Commons and its members were looked upon as old-fashioned and slightly ridiculous. As anticipation of an impending abolition grew, a reluctance among the members to admit new fellows increased, for this would dilute the proceeds of any winding up of the society&#x27;s property. Dr Thomas Hutchinson Tristram was the last to be admitted.

The Court of Probate Act 1857 abolished the testamentary jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts and gave common lawyers the right to practise in fields which before had been the exclusive domain of civilians (doctors and proctors), while offering in practice scant compensation of the reverse also being permitted. Critically, the Act also made it lawful for the Doctors&#x27; Commons, by a vote of the majority of its fellows, to dissolve itself and surrender its Royal Charter, the proceeds of dissolution to be shared among the members.

The Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 created a new divorce court in which regular barristers or doctors of Doctors&#x27; Commons could .

The High Court of Admiralty Act 1859 liberalised rights of audience in the Admiralty Court. What remained for Doctors&#x27; Commons was only the established church&#x27;s Court of Arches.

A motion to dissolve the society was entered on 13 January 1858, setting the path towards its final meeting: the end of Trinity Term, 10 July 1865. The fellows, rather than surrender their offices and charter, resolved that its property was to be sold and no appointments to any vacant post could be made. The buildings of Doctors&#x27; Commons were sold in 1865 and demolished soon after. The site is now largely occupied by the Faraday Building.

The Court of Arches gave right of audience to barristers in 1867.

The society perished with the death of its last fellow, Tristram, in 1912.

==In Victorian literature==
Satirical descriptions of Doctors&#x27; Commons can be found in Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot; and in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; in which Dickens called it a &quot;cosey, dosey, old-fashioned, time-forgotten, sleepy-headed little family party.&quot;

In the same-era novel &quot;The Moonstone&quot; by Wilkie Collins, the solicitor of Gray&#x27;s Inn Square Mathew Bruff notes, &quot;I shall perhaps do well if I explain in this place, for the benefit of the few people who don&#x27;t know it already, that the law allows all wills to be examined at Doctor&#x27;s Commons by anybody who applies, on payment of a shilling fee.&quot;

Doctors&#x27; Commons is mentioned anachronistically in the much later short story &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot; by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in which Sherlock Holmes apparently obtains some information there about the will of the wife of Dr Grimesby Roylott of Stoke Moran.

<doc id="1243011" wikidata="Q321780" url="?curid=1243011" title="Abkhazia conflict">
<text>The Abkhazia conflict is a territorial dispute over Abkhazia, a region on the eastern coast of the Black Sea in the South Caucasus, at the intersection of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. The conflict involves Georgia, the Russian Federation and the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Republic of Abkhazia, which is internationally recognised only by Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Nauru, and Syria; Georgia and all other United Nations members consider Abkhazia a sovereign territory of Georgia. However, as of 2023, Georgia lacks &quot;de facto&quot; control over the territory.

The beginning of the conflict dates back to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991; however, the dispute can be traced to 1918—1919 Abkhazia conflict over &quot;Sukhumi okrug&quot; (which corresponds to the Abkhazia region) between the Georgian Democratic Republic, White Russia and the Russian SFSR. Since 1989, the conflict has involved several wars: the 1992—1993 War in Abkhazia, the 1998 War in Abkhazia and the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.

The conflict, one of the bloodiest in the post-Soviet era, remains unresolved. The Georgian government has offered substantial autonomy to Abkhazia several times. However, both the Abkhaz government and the opposition in Abkhazia refuse any form of union with Georgia. Abkhaz regard their independence as the result of a war of liberation from Georgia, while Georgians believe that historically Abkhazia has always formed part of Georgia. Georgians formed the single largest ethnic group in pre-1993 Abkhazia, with a 45.7% plurality as of 1989. During the war the Abkhaz separatist side carried out an ethnic cleansing campaign which resulted in the expulsion of up to 250,000 and in the killing of more than 5,000 ethnic Georgians. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) conventions of Lisbon, Budapest and Istanbul have officially recognized the ethnic cleansing of Georgians, which UN General Assembly Resolution GA/10708 also mentions. The UN Security Council has passed a series of resolutions in which it appeals for a cease-fire.

== Background ==

The written history of Abkhazia largely begins with the colonization by Ancient Greeks of its coast in the 6th-5th centuries BC. During this time, the territory was part of the western Georgian kingdom of Colchis (Egrisi). During the Antiquity, various tribes were recorded on the territory today known as Abkhazia: Moschi, Sanigs, Misimians, Apsilae and Abasgois. Moschi, Sanigs and Misimians were known to have Georgian (Kartvelian) origin, while origin of Apsilae and Abasgois is disputed, with some scholars considering them to be Kartvelian tribes, while others regard them as being ancestors of people today called as Abkhazians. Throughout Antiquity, the territory was controlled by Pontus, the Roman Empire, and the Byzantine Empire. Local tribes played a huge role into consolidation of local population into single unit. They managed to break free from the Byzantine Empire in the 8th century and establish their independent kingdom. During this time, the term &quot;Apkhazeti&quot; first appeared in the Georgian annals, which is of Mingrelian (Western Georgian) origin, &quot;Apkha&quot; meaning back or shoulder. The term gave rise to the name &quot;Abkhazia&quot;, which is used today in most foreign languages. It was used to denote whole Abasgia (Byzantine name for the territory). The medieval Kingdom of Abkhazia managed to unite whole Western Georgia into a single political entity and transferred its capital to the Georgian city of Kutaisi. Although the origin of this kingdom&#x27;s ruling family is still disputed, most scholars agree that the Abkhazian kings were Georgian in culture and language. The kingdom is frequently referred in modern history writing as the Egrisi-Abkhazian kingdom due to the fact that medieval authors viewed the new monarchy as a successor state of Egrisi and sometimes used the terms interchangeably. In order to eliminate the Byzantine religious influence, the dynasty subordinated the local dioceses to the Georgian Orthodox patriarchate of Mtskheta.

In the 10th century, Kingdom of Abkhazia played an important role in Unification of the Georgian realm. Through dynastic succession, Bagrat Bagrationi united Kingdom of Abkhazia, Southern Georgian Kingdom of the Iberians and Eastern Georgian territories of Kartli under single political entity, Kingdom of Georgia. Duchy of Tskhumi was established on the territory of Abkhazia, which later was transformed into Duchy of Abkhazia. The Kingdom became the largest entity in the Caucasus by the 12th century. However, in the late 15th century, the civil strife within the Kingdom of Georgia led to its dissolution. Various new Georgian kingdoms arose in its place, such as Kingdom of Kakheti and Kingdom of Kartli in the Eastern Georgia, Samtskhe-Saatabago in the Southern Georgia and Kingdom of Imereti in the Western Georgia. The latter consisted of three principalities: Principality of Mingrelia, Principality of Guria and Principality of Abkhazia. Eventually Kingdom of Imereti declined due to power struggle within its ruling elites and constant Ottoman invasions, leading to these principalities gaining semi-independent status as they frequently acted independently and at times titled themselves as kings. In the 1570s, the Ottoman navy occupied the fort of Tskhumi on the Abkhazian coastline, turning it into the Turkish fortress of Suhum-Kale (hence, the modern name of the city of Sukhumi). In 1555, Georgia and the whole South Caucasus became divided between the Ottoman and Safavid Persian empires per the Peace of Amasya, with Abkhazia, along with all of western Georgia, remaining in the hands of the Ottomans. As a result, Abkhazia came under the increasing influence of Turkey and Islam, gradually losing its cultural and religious ties with the rest of Georgia. According to the Soviet historical science, Turkey, after the conquest has aimed at obliterating the material and spiritual culture of Abkhazia and forcibly convert the population to Islam.

==Conflict in 1918–1920==

Following the Russian Revolutions, Georgia initially joined the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic and subsequently became independent as the Democratic Republic of Georgia (DRG) governed by Georgian Mensheviks, while Abkhazia fell under control of a group of local Bolsheviks and the Red Army of Russia following a Bolshevik-led rebellion against the local Abkhazian self-government, Abkhaz People&#x27;s Council (APC). This forced the APC to request aid from the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which ousted the Bolshevik rebels in Sokhumi with the National Guard of Georgia. Abkhazia joined Democratic Republic of Georgia as an autonomous entity. This later led to the Sochi conflict between Georgia and Soviet Russia over ownership of Abkhazia and the territories of the former Black Sea Governorate. Georgia managed to repulse the Red Army from Abkhazia but conceded to Russian claims over Sochi and Tuapse. In 1920, Psou river was agreed as a new state border between Soviet Russia and Georgia. This corresponds to the modern internationally recognized Georgia–Russia border. In 1921, Abkhazia was granted the status of the autonomous republic within the Georgian Democratic Republic.

In 1921, the Red Army invaded Georgia and toppled the Menshevik government of the DRG. Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (GSSR) was established under Bolshevik government, which was later incorporated into the USSR. In exchange for support for Bolsheviks in Abkhazia, the Soviet government agreed to increase the autonomy of Abkhazia. In 1921, Socialist Soviet Republic of Abkhazia was created. However, it was not separate from Georgia and its status was defined as a &quot;treaty republic&quot; of GSSR. In 1931, status of Abkhazia was again downgraded to the autonomous republic, with Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic being established.

== The late Soviet era conflict ==
Tensions between Abkhazians and Georgians began to escalate in 1980s as Georgians increasingly pushed for independence from the Soviet Union, while Abkhazians wanted to remain in the Soviet Union. On 18 March 1989, a group of Abkhazian intellectuals wrote letter to the Kremlin, expressing their desire to upgrade the status of Abkhazia to independent SSR within the Soviet Union or join Russia as an autonomous republic. This is known as Lykhny appeal. According to the 1979 Soviet Census, Georgians made up 45.7% of the population of Abkhazia, while Abkhazians were 17.8%. In response to the appeal, the Georgian anti-Soviet groups organized a series of unsanctioned meetings across Georgia, claiming that the Soviet government was using Abkhaz separatism in order to oppose the Georgia&#x27;s pro-independence movement. The peaceful demonstration in Tbilisi was suppressed by the Soviet Army on 9 April 1989, which is known today as April 9 tragedy. In July 1989, the riots started in Abkhazia with the Abkhaz protest against an opening of a branch of Tbilisi State University in Sukhumi, and concluded with the looting of the Georgian school which was expected to house the new university on 16 July 1989. The ensuing violence quickly degenerated into a large-scale inter-ethnic confrontation. The first case of inter-ethnic violence in Georgia, it effectively marked the start of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict.

The July events in Abkhazia left at least 18 dead and 448 injured, of whom, according to official accounts, 302 were Georgians. The local Abkhaz authorities endeavored to regulate the flow of information by censoring newspaper articles and television programs deemed to threaten the peace of multiethnic autonomy. On August 15, 1990, the Georgian section of Abkhazian radio appealed to the Chairman of the Ministerial Council to safeguard the rights and freedoms of expression. In response to this appeal, the Abkhaz authorities imposed a ban on radio broadcasts concerning the Georgian language and interfered with the editorial policies of journalists. Although the government managed to end the violence and maintain peace at that time, the conflict developed further and resulted in the next years in what is often referred as &quot;war of laws&quot;. In 1991, Georgia refused to take part in referendum to preserve the Soviet Union as a renewed federation, opting to hold an independence referendum, which led to a declaration of independence. However, Abkhazia defied Tbilisi and took part in the Soviet referendum, which was boycotted by the Georgian population of Abkhazia.

In order to defuse tensions, newly elected Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia agreed on an arrangement to grant a wide over-representation to the Abkhazians in the local Supreme Council, with Abkhazians, while being only 18% of the population, getting the largest portion of seats. According to this settlement, the 65 seats in the Supreme Soviet were allocated to different ethnic groups; 28 were reserved for Abkhazians, 26 for Georgians (46% of the total population) and 11 for the other ethnic groups. The elections were held in September 1991 and resulted in Vladislav Ardzinba being appointed as Chairman of the Abkhazian Supreme Council. Ardzinba, who was a charismatic but excitable figure popular among the Abkhaz, was believed by Georgians to have helped to instigate the anti-Georgian violence of July 1989. Ardzinba exploited the Georgian Civil War which began in December 1991 to consolidate his power and launched a practice of replacing ethnic Georgians in leading positions with the Abkhaz. Ardzinba created the Abkhazian National Guard that was mono-ethnically Abkhaz, and on 24 June 1992, attacked the building of the Abkhazian Interior Ministry, a last stronghold of Georgian authority in Abkhazia, severely beating the ethnic Georgian minister Givi Lominadze and installing Abkhaz Alexander Ankvab. These events led to a split in the Supreme Council between Georgian and Abkhazian factions and forced the Georgian faction to boycott the sessions. In turn, On 23 July 1992, the Abkhazian faction of the Supreme Council, without a quorum, passed a resolution on restoring the 1925 Abkhazian constitution, declaring a &quot;sovereign state&quot; from Georgia. On 25 July 1992, State Council of the Republic of Georgia, a governing body of Georgia at that time, responded with a special resolution, which nullified this declaration, with Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze pointing out that the separatist decision contradicted the opinion of the majority of Abkhazian population. Meanwhile, the Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba intensified his ties with hard-line Russian politicians and military elite and declared he was ready for a war with Georgia. Russia used Abkhaz and also South Ossetian separatists as its ethnically-based proxies to inflame ethnic conflicts in Georgia, undermine Georgian independence and assert Russia&#x27;s control over the strategically important South Caucasus.

== War in Abkhazia ==
The conflict eventually devolved into a war, which lasted for 13 months, beginning in August, 1992, with Georgian government forces and a militia composed of ethnic Georgians who lived in Abkhazia and separatist forces consisting of ethnic Abkhazians and Armenians who also lived in Abkhazia. The separatists were supported by the North Caucasian and Cossack militants and (unofficially) by Russian forces stationed in Gudauta. The conflict resulted in the ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia. The agreement in Moscow ended hostilities in 1994, however, this would not last.

== Resumption of hostilities ==
In April–May 1998, the conflict escalated once again in the Gali District when several hundred Abkhaz forces entered the villages still populated by Georgians to support the separatist-held parliamentary elections. Despite criticism from the opposition, Eduard Shevardnadze, President of Georgia, refused to deploy troops against Abkhazia. A ceasefire was negotiated on May 20. The hostilities resulted in hundreds of casualties from both sides and an additional 20,000 Georgian refugees.

In September 2001, around 400 Chechen fighters and 80 Georgian guerrillas appeared in the Kodori Valley. The Chechen-Georgian paramilitaries advanced as far as Sukhumi, but finally were repelled by the Abkhazian forces.

== Saakashvili era ==
The new Georgian government of President Mikheil Saakashvili promised not to use force and to resolve the problem only by diplomacy and political talks.

Georgia decried the unlimited issuing of Russian passports in Abkhazia with subsequent payment of retirement pensions and other monetary benefits by Russia, which Georgia considers to be economic support of separatists by the Russian government.

In May 2006 the Coordinating Council of Georgia&#x27;s Government and Abkhaz separatists was convened for the first time since 2001. In late July the 2006 Kodori crisis erupted, resulting in the establishment of the de jure Government of Abkhazia in Kodori. For the first time after the war, this government was located in Abkhazia, and it was headed by Malkhaz Akishbaia, Temur Mzhavia and Ada Marshania.

On May 15, 2008 United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution recognising the right of all refugees to return to Abkhazia and reclaim their property rights. It regretted the attempts to alter pre-war demographic composition and called for the &quot;rapid development of a timetable to ensure the prompt voluntary return of all refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes.&quot;

== August 2008 ==
On August 10, 2008, the Russo-Georgian War spread to Abkhazia, where separatist rebels and the Russian air force launched an all-out attack on Georgian forces. Abkhazia&#x27;s pro-Moscow separatist President Sergei Bagapsh said that his troops had launched a major &quot;military operation&quot; to force Georgian troops out of the Kodori Gorge, which they still controlled. As a result of this attack, Georgian troops were driven out of Abkhazia entirely.

On August 26, 2008, the Russian Federation officially recognized both South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states.

In response to Russia&#x27;s recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the Georgian government announced that the country cut all diplomatic relations with Russia and that it left the Commonwealth of Independent States.

== After the 2008 war ==
Relations between Georgia and Abkhazia have remained tense after the war. Georgia has moved to increase Abkhazia&#x27;s isolation by imposing a sea blockade of Abkhazia. During the opening ceremony of a new building of the Georgian Embassy in Kyiv (Ukraine) in November 2009, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili stated that residents of South Ossetia and Abkhazia could also use its facilities. &quot;I would like to assure you, my dear friends, that this is your home, as well, and here you will always be able to find support and understanding&quot;, he said.

On July 9, 2012, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly passed a resolution at its annual session in Monaco, underlining Georgia&#x27;s territorial integrity and referring to breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia as occupied territories. The resolution &quot;urges the Government and the Parliament of the Russian Federation, as well as the de facto authorities of Abkhazia, Georgia and South Ossetia, Georgia, to allow the European Union Monitoring Mission unimpeded access to the occupied territories.&quot; It also said that the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly was &quot;concerned about the humanitarian situation of the displaced persons both in Georgia and in the occupied territories of Abkhazia, Georgia and South Ossetia, Georgia, as well as the denial of the right of return to their places of living.&quot;

In 2016, murder of ethnic Georgian Giga Otkhozoria by Abkhaz border guards caused international resonance and raised question about human rights situation of ethnic Georgians remaining in Abkhazia, particularly Gali district, where 98% is ethnic Georgian and is often subject to ethnic discrimination, denial of political and civil rights and police misconduct.

<text>Carolyn Robertson Payton (May 13, 1925 – April 11, 2001) was appointed Director of the United States Peace Corps in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. She was the first female and the first African American to be Peace Corps Director. Payton was a pioneer in black women&#x27;s leadership within the American Psychological Association and psychology.

==Early life and education==
She was born Carolyn Robertson in Norfolk, Virginia in 1925. Her father, Leroy Solomon Robertson, was a chef and her mother, Bertha Flanagan Robertson, a seamstress and homemaker. Payton came from a close knit family that emphasized the value of education. Her grandfather, although born into slavery, saw to it that all of his children attended college. Payton&#x27;s father enrolled her at Bennett College in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1941 majoring in home economics and graduated in 1945. Payton said that Bennett, a small historically Black women&#x27;s college, shaped her aspirations, attitudes, and expectations and gave her a sense of her capabilities as a woman. She remained close to Bennett College during her entire life and established a scholarship fund there in the late 1990s.

Payton transferred to the University of Wisconsin–Madison for her M.S. degree in clinical psychology in 1948. Under the &quot;separate-but-equal&quot; doctrine, the state of Virginia covered her expenses at the out-of-state school because she pursued a graduate degree in a discipline available to White students at a White state schools, but unavailable to Blacks at a Black state school. Payton conducted her masters thesis on the then newly developed Wechsler-Bellevue Test of Intelligence and concluded that the test provided an inaccurate measure of the true ability of Blacks.

While at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Payton married Raymond Rudolph Payton, a police detective, but the marriage lasted less than four years and the two divorced in 1951. Payton began taking summer courses at Columbia University&#x27;s teachers college in 1952 and received her Ed.D. in counseling and student administration in 1962.

==Academic career==
Payton began her first job as an instructor in psychology at Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina in 1948 and worked there for five years. In 1953 she became Dean of Women and a psychology instructor at Elizabeth City State Teachers College (now Elizabeth City State University) in North Carolina. In 1956, Payton became an associate professor of psychology at Virginia State College in Petersburg, Virginia. Payton was appointed an assistant professor in psychology at Howard University in 1959.

After leaving the Peace Corps in 1978, Payton returned to Howard University where she was appointed Dean of Counseling and Career Development and later Director of University Counseling Services. As Dean she helped develop an internship-training center. Payton retired from Howard in 1995.

==Peace Corps==

===Staff member===
Payton started at the Peace Corps as a field assignment officer in 1964 helping prepare trainees to serve in West Africa. Payton traveled extensively for the Peace Corps performing psychological tests, interviews, clinical observations and peer reviews to help determine the conditions that would lead to the most satisfying experience for Peace Corps volunteers. In 1966 she was appointed Deputy Country Director for the Caribbean and in 1967 was appointed as Country Director for the Caribbean region supervising 130 volunteers involved in education projects on eight islands in the eastern Caribbean. At the time she was one of two women who were country directors.

===Director===
Payton was appointed Director of the Peace Corps by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. As Peace Corps Director Payton clashed with Sam Brown, Director of ACTION, which had been created in 1971 by President Richard Nixon to administer the Peace Corps, Volunteers in Service to America and other service programs. Brown wanted to &quot;send volunteers for short periods to developing countries and then bring back the skills they had learned to fight poverty in the United States&quot;. According to Payton, Brown&#x27;s policy went against the original goals of the Peace Corps and said that Brown was &quot;trying to turn the corps into an arrogant, elitist political organization intended to meddle in the affairs of foreign governments.&quot; According to Senate testimony Payton&#x27;s differences with Brown ended in an argument during a trip to Morocco, when Brown openly berated Payton before Action Corps officials and later went to her hotel room and pounded on her door for fifteen minutes, demanding to be let in to continue his harassment.

Payton resigned in 1978 after thirteen months as Director citing, in part, policy differences between ACTION and the Peace Corps saying &quot;as Director, I could not, because of the peculiar administrative structure under which the Peace Corps operates, do anything about this situation. As an ex-director, I am free to sound the alarm.&quot; After Payton&#x27;s resignation, President Carter issued an executive order taking the Peace Corps out from under ACTION and making it a fully autonomous agency.

===Continued connection===
Payton retained her connection to the Peace Corps. In 1981, she spoke about the contribution that volunteers had made around the world, &quot;I think the whole idea of Peace Corps was brought home to me most recently last summer, when there was a terribly damaging hurricane in the Caribbean. Some of the Volunteers who had served with me there were collecting food, clothes and money to send back to the Islanders. Those Volunteers had left the Islands in 1967, but they still had a concern and care about those Islanders. That&#x27;s what I think is at the heart of the Peace Corps, and that&#x27;s why the Peace Corps is relevant today.&quot; Payton was awarded the Peace Corps Leader for Peace Award in 1988. In 2000, Payton attended the swearing in ceremony for Peace Corps Director Mark L. Schneider.

==Professional activities and awards==
Payton was very active in the American Psychological Association (APA) and served on many committees and task forces including the Committee on Scientific and Professional Ethics and Conduct, the Task Force on Sex Bias and Sex Role Stereotyping in Psychotherapeutic Practice, the Committee on Women in Psychology, the Committee on Lesbian and Gay Concerns, and the Policy and Planning Board. Payton was made a fellow of APA in 1987. She also won the Distinguished Professional Contributions to Public Service Award from APA in 1982. In 1985, the APA Committee on Women in Psychology Leadership Citation Award honored her for her role as &quot;an outstanding teacher, role model, and mentor for women and ethnic minorities. She has provided leadership on ethical and consumer issues in psychology and in eliminating sex bias in psychotherapeutic practice...her commitment to equality and justice for all oppressed peoples has made a precious difference in all our lives.&quot; In 1997, Payton received the APA Award for Outstanding Lifetime Contribution to Psychology for her &quot;dedication to using psychology to promote better cross-cultural understanding and to end social injustice by influencing political process...[Her] success in overcoming gender and racial barriers to achieve positions of leadership and prestige make [her] a role model to women and ethnic minorities everywhere.&quot;

<text>Mouse-like hamsters, also called brush-tailed mice, are a group of small rodents found in Syria, Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. They are found in rocky outcrops and semi-mountainous areas in desert regions.

The mouse-like hamsters are not true hamsters, but represent an early split from the rest of the mouse-like rodents. They were once thought to be hamsters based on the shape of their molars, but they lack the cheek pouches, flank glands and short tails of the true hamsters. The closest relatives of the mouse-like hamsters may be the extinct Cricetodontidae. Because of their seemingly early break from the rest of the mouse-like rodents, mouse-like hamsters have been placed in a family of their own, Calomyscidae, and have been referred to as living fossils.

All members of the genus were once considered part of the same species, &quot;Calomyscus bailwardi&quot;, but they are now considered separate species due to major differences in chromosome number, skull measurements, and other features.

In Europe, a species of Calomyscus is available as a pet. They are labelled &quot;Calomyscus bailwardi mystax&quot; or &quot;Calomyscus bailwardi&quot;. They are generally only available from dedicated breeders, not pet shops.

<text>Baer&#x27;s pochard (Aythya baeri) is a diving duck found in eastern Asia. It is a bird in North and Central China, and formerly bred in southeast Russia and Northeast China, migrating in winter to southern China, Vietnam, Japan, and India. Baer&#x27;s pochard is a monotypic species. The holotype was collected in middle Amur.

It has a distinctive black head and neck with green gloss. While in poor light, it is likely to look completely black. It is similar and closely related to the ferruginous duck, and they were previously considered to be a single species; Baer&#x27;s pochard is differentiated by its white flanks when floating on the water, as well as its longer, more rounded head and larger size.

Its breeding season varies by latitude and environment. The nest, built from sedges, reeds and other plants, is placed among emergent vegetation, usually in shallow water or on small islands or ridges. Its clutch size ranges from 5 to 14. Males usually take on sentry duty, and females take on the responsibility of incubating.

Baer&#x27;s pochard was once a common species in its range, but is now very rare. The number of mature individuals may be less than 1,000, and its population is still declining. Hunting and habitat loss are considered to be the main reasons. This species has been classified as critically endangered by the IUCN, and listed as a first-class protected animal in China.

== Taxonomy ==
Baer&#x27;s pochard was first scientifically described in 1863 as &quot;Anas baeri&quot; by Gustav Radde in his book &quot;Reisen im Süden von Ost-Sibirien&quot;. The epithet and English common name commemorate the Baltic German naturalist Karl Ernst von Baer. It is also called eastern white-eye, Siberian white-eye, Baer&#x27;s white-eye and green-headed pochard. The holotype was collected from a small flock in middle Amur during the breeding season. In 1929, when British ornithologist E. C. Stuart Baker studied the birds of British India, he treated Baer&#x27;s pochard and ferruginous duck as conspecific. However, Chinese ornithologist Tso-hsin Cheng treated them as two distinct species, as they had breeding grounds which did not overlap, and he had seen no evidence of hybridisation. While the species was long thought to have arisen from eastern populations of the ferruginous duck, American ornithologist Paul Johnsgard says its behaviors suggest it may instead be more closely related to the hardhead.

American ornithologist Bradley Curtis Livezey published a phylogenetic study based on morphological data in 1996, in which he proposed his view on the relationship among Tribe Aythyini. Baer&#x27;s pochard, ferruginous duck, hardhead and Madagascar pochard are classified in subgenus &quot;Nyroca&quot; (the &quot;white-eyes&quot;), intrasubgenus relationship is unclear, but the ferruginous duck was suggested to be the sister group of Baer&#x27;s pochard. The subgenus &quot;Aythya&quot; (the &quot;scaup&quot;, including New Zealand Scaup, ring-necked duck, tufted duck, greater scaup and lesser scaup) is the sister group of subgenus &quot;Nyroca&quot;. The subgenus &quot;Aristonetta&quot; (the &quot;redheads&quot;, including the common pochard, canvasback and redhead) is the sister group of all other pochards.

Two molecular phylogenetic studies on Anseriformes or Anatidae were published in 2000s, some mitochondrial genes were sequenced, but Baer&#x27;s pochard was absent in both of them. The mitochondrial genome of Baer&#x27;s pochard was sequenced and published in 2021. Molecular phylogenetic studies determined the relationships among Baer&#x27;s pochard and other closely related species:

==Description==

The Baer&#x27;s pochard is long with a wingspan. The male is slightly larger, weighing on average , wings lengthed , tail at , and culmen at . Relatively, the female weighing on average , wings lengthed , tail at , and culmen at . Both male and female&#x27;s tarsometatarsus lengthed .

Breeding male has a black head and neck with green gloss, white or paler yellow eyes, blackish-brown back, dark chestnut breast, white or light chestnut flanks and a short and low tail. While it is likely to look completely black in poor light. Female has brown eyes and a dark brown head and neck that blend into the chestnut-brown breast and flanks. Eclipse and first-winter male resembles female, but retain the white eyes. Both male and female have wide white speculum feathers, white vent-side, dark-grey bill, black nail and dark-grey tarsometatarsus.

It is similar to its close relative, the ferruginous duck (&quot;A. nyroca&quot;), both have white vent-side and iris in males, black nail, and wide white speculum feathers. Although Baer&#x27;s pochard is bigger, has a longer head, body and bill. Unlike the ferruginous duck&#x27;s tall and triangular head, Baer&#x27;s pochard has a more rounded head and a flatter forehead. The white part on the belly extends to its flanks in Baer&#x27;s pochard, which is visible when floating on the water, while the ferruginous duck has a smaller white part on its belly. The female Baer&#x27;s pochard has a distinctly bright chestnut spot at the lore, which is absent in ferruginous duck.

Baer&#x27;s pochard is usually a quieter duck, but during its courtship display, both sexes give harsh &quot;graaaak&quot;. Females may give &quot;kura kura kura&quot; and males may give &quot;kuro kuro&quot; at other times.

==Distribution==

Baer&#x27;s pochard traditionally bred in the Amur and Ussuri basins in Northeast China and the southeastern Russian Far East. In recent years, it has also colonised North China and Central China. It winters in most areas south of the Yellow River in China, Taiwan, Japan, Bangladesh, India, North Korea, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand and Vietnam, and occasionally appears in Bhutan, South Korea, Philippines or Pakistan as a rare vagrant. It leaves its wintering grounds by mid-March and returns to them by mid-October or early November.

The species has become extremely rare in its traditional breeding areas, and since 2010, there have been no confirmed breeding reports in all sites north of Beijing. However, the numbers recorded during the breeding season are smaller than those recorded in winter, so there may still be unknown breeding sites. For example, there are some doubtful breeding reports in the Chinese part of Lake Khanka, the Russian part of Lake Khasan, and the . Since 2012, new breeding sites have been discovered in several provinces of China, including Hebei, Hubei and Jiangxi; the latter two cities are far from traditional breeding sites in the Amur and Ussuri basins. In these new breeding areas, warmer climate conditions provide a longer breeding season (about twice as long as in the Amur and Ussuri basins) which allows birds to lay a replacement clutch if their first clutch fails. Baer&#x27;s pochard is no longer migratory in central and eastern China.

The wintering grounds have also contracted significantly in recent years. Since at least the winter of 2010-2011, Baer&#x27;s pochard no longer winters in any site outside mainland China, except as a . In its wintering grounds in mainland China, the population has also declined severely, by more than 99%.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Baer&#x27;s pochard is a shy species, that inhabit open, slow-flowing lakes, swamps and ponds. It breeds around lakes with rich aquatic vegetation, nesting in dense grass, flooded tussock meadows, or flooded shrubby meadows. In winter, it forms large flocks on large and open freshwater lakes and reservoirs with other pochards. It has strong wings, and can flyor walk at high speeds. It is also good at diving and swimming, and can quickly take off from the water when threatened or disturbed. In migrating season, they form small groups of more than 10 or dozens of birds, flying at low altitudes in wedge-shaped formations. During winter, Baer&#x27;s pochard sleeps during the day, leaves for unknown feeding sites with other ducks in the dusk, and returns before dawn. Little is known about their diet beyond aquatic plants, grass seeds and molluscs.

===Breeding===

Baer&#x27;s pochard appears to have a monogamous mating system, at least within a breeding season. In traditional breeding grounds in northeastern China, Baer&#x27;s pochard gathers in gaps in the ice before it completely thawed. After the ice season, it gathers on the large, open lakes. They breed from mid-to-late May. While in Fuhe Wetland in Wuhan, Hubei, Baer&#x27;s pochard gathers in large groups on the open lakes before breeding season. It is divided into small groups in mid-April, in which they will courting and mating. During courtship, the male swims around the female, repeatedly nods his head up and down. When other males approach, it swims toward them quickly to drive them away, but there is no violent fight between them. The female also nods her head in response. When the male approaches, the female straightens her neck and lowers her head to the water. He then climbs onto her body and bites her nape feathers to mate. After the mating, the male and female leave the flock for nesting.

Baer&#x27;s pochard&#x27;s nest is circular cylindrical, located among emergent vegetation, usually in shallow water or on small islands or ridges. The nest is made of sedges, reeds and other plants collected from the immediate vicinity, lined with a layer of down. Its clutch ranged from 5 to 14, with an average of 9.7. Males usually take on sentry duty at about 10 meters from the nest during hatching. Females leave the nest to forage 2–3 times a day, usually during 6:00-20:00, and lasted for 27–240 min. They cover the eggs with nest materials during forging, and place them onto their back when coming back. If water levels are elevated by heavy rainfall or human activity, females increase the height of the nest to avoid flooding. During the hottest days, females often stand on the nest and shelter eggs from the strong sunlight, whilst allowing circulation of air around them. Females also take water into their plumage and use it to cool the eggs. The incubation lasted for 23–26 days.

Studies have shown that the nest survival rate of Baer&#x27;s pochards is about 14–45%, and each clutch may lose one to nine eggs. About 20-30% of eggs hatched successfully, and 3–16 young fledged per nest. There are three major reasons contributing to the failure, including nest desertion (abandoned by parents), nest predation (mainly by Siberian Weasels) and flooding. The proportion of these causes varies among years. In addition, most of the breeding sites in Wuhan are crayfish farms, the farming work and eggs collection may also be hindrances.

===Biological interaction===
Incomplete inter- and intra-specific brood parasitism were found in Baer&#x27;s pochard. In , Baer&#x27;s pochards could parasitize gadwall and common pochard, and may be parasitized by common pochard. In Wuhan, Baer&#x27;s pochard shares breeding sites with cotton teal, eastern spot-billed duck and mallard. Interspecific brood parasitism was not observed. Intraspecific parasitic was found in Wuhan. If caught, the parasite will get attacked by the host.

Baer&#x27;s pochard has hybridized with lesser scaup, common pochard, ferruginous duck, New Zealand scaup, chestnut teal and wood duck in captivity. Ferruginous duck was observed displaying to Baer&#x27;s pochards several times in China and South Korea. Some individuals showed mixed characteristics of common, ferruginous and Baer&#x27;s pochards, so they may be currently hybridising in the wild. The Baer&#x27;s pochard has declined sharply in recent years, but the ferruginous and common pochard has expanded their breeding grounds, and even to the core areas of Baer&#x27;s pochard&#x27;s, which makes the hypothesis possible.

The research on its gut microbiota showed that the richest microorganism phyla of Baer&#x27;s pochard are Bacillota, Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota, which were consistent with those of the domestic goose, duck and chicken. The gut microbiota in diarrheic Baer&#x27;s pochard is low in diversity, and the species were also significantly different from healthy individuals. Most species in reduced numbers are thought to be intestinal beneficial bacteria.

==Threats and protection==

Baer&#x27;s pochard was once a common species in its range, but is now very rare. Mature individuals may be less than 1,000. According to records in China, there were 16,792 wintering individuals from 1986/87 to 1992/93, but only 3,472 from 1993/94 to 1998/99, and only 2,131 from 2002/03 to 2010/11. Bangladesh had more than 3,000 in 1996, India had more than 1,400 in 1995 and 1997, Myanmar had about 500-1,000 in the 1990s, and 596 were counted in 1998 in Thailand. While by 1999/00-2004/05, only 719 were counted in all wintering grounds except China, and only 48 individuals in 2005/06-2010/11. In China, hunting and habitat loss were considered to be the main threats. From 336 to 4,803 pochards were hunted annually in Honghu, Hubei from 1981 to 1997; in areas near Rudong County, maybe 3,000 are hunted every year. The wintering grounds have been significantly changed due to water pollution, fishing management, changes in aquatic plants, and the changing ecology of many wetlands in the Yangtze River floodplain. Factors in breeding and migrating grounds may also have contributed to its decline. The global decline shows no sign of slowing or stopping.

Baer&#x27;s pochard was formerly classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. Recent research has shown that its numbers are decreasing more and more rapidly, and it was consequently uplisted to endangered status in 2008. In 2012, it was further uplisted to critically endangered. In 2014, the East Asian–Australasian Flyway Partnership (EAAFP) drafted the Baer&#x27;s Pochard Task Force and it was endorsed in Jan 2015. Baer&#x27;s pochard was listed as a first-class protected animal in China by 2021. In 2022, media reports state that the first captive population in China was established in the Beijing Zoo, with totally 54 individuals. It is planned to be further expanded and used for reintroduction.

A study published in 2022 showed that most breeding sites (81.8%) and suitable habitats (94%) are not located in protected areas, and overlap with large cities. Current protected areas may be less effective for the conservation under predicted global climate change, closely coordinated cross-border cooperation would be critical for Baer&#x27;s pochard.

<text>Politehnica University of Bucharest () is a technical university in Bucharest, Romania founded in 1818. Politehnica University is classified by the Ministry of Education as an &quot;advanced research and education university&quot;.

The university is a member of the European Association for International Education (EAIE), the European University Association (EUA), the EUA Council for Doctoral Education, the CESAER (Council of Universities of Science and Technology in Europe), and the Romanian Alliance of Technical Universities (ARUT).

==History==
Politehnica University of Bucharest is the largest technical university in Romania. Its traditions are connected to the founding of the first higher technical school in Wallachia, in 1818, by Gheorghe Lazăr. Born in Avrig, Transylvania, Gheorghe Lazăr studied in Sibiu, Cluj, and Vienna. In 1817–1818 he endeavored to convince the local noblemen of the need to support a modern technical school in Romania. Thus, on 24 March 1818, by a princely edict of Ioan Caragea, it was organised the &quot;Technical Superior School for Surveying Engineers&quot; (&quot;Școala Tehnică Superioară pentru Ingineri Hotarnici&quot;) within the &quot;Academic School for Philosophy and Mathematical Sciences&quot; of the Saint Sava Princely Academy.

In 1832 the school was reorganized, including four cycles, in accordance with the provisions of Organic Regulation. Among other faculties, the one dealing with exact sciences included courses such as applied trigonometry, geodesy, mineralogy, engineering graphics, descriptive geometry, mechanical elements applied to ordinary machines, principles of building roads and bridges, elements of architecture, etc. The graduates were obliged either to work for three years for the state or to return the grant received.

In 1862, the ruler of the United Principalities, Alexandru Ioan Cuza, had established by another Princely Decree a set of rules for the organisation of civil engineers, the hierarchy of engineers or conductors, their salaries, the conditions for admission and promotion, were clearly defined. On 1 October 1864, the &quot;School of Bridges and Roads, Mines and Architecture&quot; was established.


An important figure in the &quot;School of Bridges, Roads and Mines&quot; was . As early as 1887, he analysed the content of courses, finding the weaknesses of the school, as well as the best solutions to improve its academic level. In those times, a substantial condition was the severity imposed on the conduct of students, in addition to evaluation. Students obtaining insufficient results, or having an erratic course attendance, were quickly removed from the school. Indeed, at the beginning, the preparatory year had no admission tests.

Starting with 1881, an admission test was introduced; the top priority was the quality of candidates, the number of the selected ones being less important. Gheorghe Duca tried and succeeded to bring the best professors to the “National School of Bridges and Roads”; among these were David Emmanuel (Elementary Mathematics), Spiru Haret (Higher Algebra and Analytical Geometry), C. M. Mironescu (Statistics and Engineering Graphics), Constantin Istrati (Physics), or Anghel Saligny (Bridges and Roads). Moreover, Gheorghe Duca himself was considered the greatest authority in railways at the end of the 19th century. This was perhaps a turning moment, when it was clearly demonstrated that Romania was capable of achieving on its own what had been deemed likely to be obtained only abroad, namely the training of highly qualified science and engineering specialists.

The year 1890 also represented a momentous point, when at the National School of Bridges and Roads a new commission was set up. Its main role was to issue equivalency certificates for the engineering diplomas obtained abroad, thus transforming this national school into a model for evaluating higher technical studies.

Nicolae Vasilescu-Karpen was appointed director of the School in February 1920. As a direct result of his endeavors, the government approved the establishment of Polytechnic Schools in Romania, conceived as higher education institutions, similar to universities, having as their final aim engineering training under the Ministry of Public Works.
The Polytechnic School was set up by transforming the &quot;National School of Bridges and Roads&quot; to the &quot;Polytechnic School of Bucharest&quot;. In its initial stage it consisted of four sections:
* Civil Engineering;
* Mechanics and Electricity;
* Mines and Metallurgy;
* The Industrial Section.

During this period, in addition to the Polytechnic School, there were Institutes for Engineers within Universities. For instance, the University of Bucharest hosted an institute for electrical engineering, an institute for industrial chemistry and another one for agricultural and food chemistry.
Another important cornerstone was Decree 3799 of 1938 stating that higher education could be provided only by universities, Polytechnic Schools, or Academies for Commercial Studies. As a direct result, the Academy of Higher Agricultural Studies, the Academy of Architecture, the Institute of Industrial Chemistry and Agricultural and Food Chemistry, respectively, were introduced in the framework of &quot;Bucharest Politehnica&quot;. The change of name from &quot;Polytechnic School of Bucharest&quot; into &quot;Politehnica Carol II of Bucharest&quot; was accompanied by other changes as well. Thus, Politehnica depended on the Ministry of National Education (instead of the Ministry for Public Works), the former director became Rector of Politehnica, the different sections became Faculties, their presidents in turn, became Deans etc.
Between 1938 and 1948 Politehnica of Bucharest had seven faculties: Civil Engineering, Electro-mechanics, Metallurgy, Industrial Chemistry, Silviculture, Agronomy, and Architecture.
Another important transformation took place in 1948, when several Politehnica or even specialities became independent, or even moved to other cities. Some of the new universities, institutes or faculties had their roots in the old &quot;Politehnica of Bucharest&quot;. Thus, the following establishments, were initially faculties or departments at &quot;Politehnica&quot; of Bucharest: Technical University of Civil Engineering of Bucharest; Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism; University of Agronomic Sciences; Faculty of Forestry - Transilvania University of Brașov; School of Mines - Petroșani; Oil &amp; Gas University of Ploieşti; Faculty for Food Chemistry - University of Galați; Faculty for Textile Industry - Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iași.
In 1948–1992, the name of the school was &quot;The Polytechnic Institute of Bucharest&quot;. For some years it was called &quot;Institutul Politehnic &#x27;Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27; București&quot;. Based on a resolution of the Senate (November 1992), the Polytechnic Institute of Bucharest turned into University Politehnica of Bucharest.

==Ranking==

According to the Scimago Lab, based on data collected between 2007 and 2011, Politehnica University of Bucharest ranked 546 in the World, 15 regionally and number one in the country by number of publications.

At the 29th annual ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, held at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, on April 6, 2005, Politehnica student team ranked 10th.

== Faculties ==
The university is structured into faculties. The faculties are distinct academic entities, each having its own admission criteria, largely distinct staff and limited interaction. However, there are a number of commonalities: all the faculties provide only engineering degrees, there is a largely common curricula that is observed in the first year of studies, there are shared teaching facilities and shared student facilities. Teaching is conducted in Romanian and at the Faculty of Engineering in Foreign Languages teaching is conducted in one of the languages: English, French, and German. Currently there are fifteen faculties. :

* Faculty of Electrical Engineering;
* Faculty of Power Engineering; 
* Faculty of Automation and Computer Science;

<text>The New Zealand scaup (Aythya novaeseelandiae), also known as the black teal (or in Māori), is a diving duck species of the genus &quot;Aythya&quot; endemic to New Zealand. They weigh around and measure around , and have dark-coloured plumage. They are found throughout New Zealand in deep natural and man-made lakes and ponds.

New Zealand scaups lay around 7 eggs and the ducklings are immediately capable of diving to feed. Adult scaups can dive to at least 3 metres and for as long as a minute for aquatic plants and invertebrates. Scaups started declining in the late 1800s until they were fully protected in 1934, and their population is now increasing thanks to predator control and new habitat.

==Taxonomy==

The New Zealand scaup was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the ducks, geese and swans in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas novaeseelandiae&quot;. Gmelin based his description of the &quot;New-Zealand duck&quot; that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. The naturalist Joseph Banks had provided Latham with a water-colour drawing of the duck by Georg Forster who had accompanied James Cook on his second voyage to the Pacific Ocean. His picture of a male bird was drawn in April 1773 at Dusky Sound, a fjord on the southwest corner of New Zealand. This picture is the holotype for the species and is now held by the Natural History Museum in London. The New Zealand scaup is now placed with 11 other species in the genus &quot;Aythya&quot; that was introduced in 1822 by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie. The genus name &quot;Aythya&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek word (), which may have referred to a sea-dwelling duck. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The New Zealand scaup is a small, round-bodied diving duck that have dark plumage, but both sexes are easily distinguished. They have black legs and webbed feet for swimming, and they spend a lot of time underwater, where they can also travel considerable distances. They measure around in length and weigh around for males, and around for females.

The male has dark black-brown plumage with a striking yellow eye and a dark coloured (greenish) head. The female has duller chocolate brown plumage, brown eyes and has a white face patch during breeding season. A white wing bar can be seen in both sexes when in flight, and both sexes have a grey bill.

The young are initially covered in pale brown and white down, and juveniles look like the female, except with no white at the base of the bill.

The males have a high pitched whistle call and the females &#x27;quack&#x27;.

==Distribution and habitat==
They are found throughout both the North and South Island of New Zealand in deep freshwater lakes and ponds, and recently, hydroelectric lakes and oxidation ponds. Despite being widespread, they have a patchy distribution, and most scaups are on suitable habitat areas in Northland, the upper Waikato, Rotorua, Taupō, Hawke&#x27;s Bay, West Coast, North Canterbury, and the Southern Alps. Unlike other members of this genus, the scaup is not migratory, although it does move to open water from high country lakes if they become frozen in winter. A recent population expansion has happened in Christchurch thanks to predator control and suitable habitat.

==Behaviour and ecology==
New Zealand scaups are usually seen in flocks during autumn in winter, with flocks of over 200 birds seen at traditional moulting and wintering sites such as Lake Rotorua, Lake Taupō, Lake Tūtira, the Bromley sewage ponds, and the Ashburton Lakes.

===Breeding===

New Zealand scaups typically leave their wintering flocks by September, and the males become territorial. The nest is a bowl of grass, sedges and other similar plants, lined with down, and in dense cover close to water. Sometimes scaups breed in loose colonies if suitable breeding habitat is scarce.

Egg laying is mostly from late October to December, but some late or replacement clutches are laid until February. The clutch of can contain 2–15 creamy-white coloured eggs, although the typical range is 6–8 eggs, and clutches of 12 eggs or more are probably laid by multiple female scaups. The eggs are around 65mm x 45mm (2.56in x 1.77in) in size, and weigh around . The eggs are laid in an interval of 1.2–1.4 days, and are incubated by the female for around 30 days.

The female broods the ducklings on the nest for up to 24 hours before leading the ducklings to water. The ducklings are immediately capable of diving to feed. The female guards the brood during the fledging period of around 75 days. Occasionally, rafts are formed by several females and their ducklings; these can have up to 50 birds.

Average and maximum lifespan, age at first breeding, and survival rate of fledglings is not known because few New Zealand scaups have been banded.

===Feeding===
The New Zealand scaup is a diving duck which dives to look for aquatic plants, small fish, water snails, mussels and insects. It is sometimes seen with the Australian coot (&quot;Fulica atra&quot;); it is thought that the scaup takes advantage of the food stirred up by the coots as they fossick for shrimps. Scaups dive to at least 3 metres, but probably dive much deeper. Most dives last 15–20 seconds, but some dives last for over a minute.

==Threats and conservation==
During the late 1800s and early 1900s, New Zealand scaup populations declined due to habitat destruction, introduction of predators and duck hunting. Adults and ducklings are vulnerable to predation during nesting and chick-rearing which may result in low breeding success.

New Zealand scaups started recovering after they were partially protected in 1921 and fully protected in 1934. Predator control and new breeding and feeding habitat has allowed the scaup population to increase, especially in Christchurch, where scaups have recolonised the area.

The last time the population of the New Zealand scaup was assessed in the 1990s, the population was estimated to be around 20,000; the population has most likely increased since then.

<text>The East African Community (EAC) is an intergovernmental organisation in East Africa. The EAC&#x27;s membership consists of eight states: Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Federal Republic of Somalia, the Republics of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda, and Tanzania. William Ruto, the president of Kenya, is the current EAC chairman. The organisation was founded in 1967, collapsed in 1977, and was revived on 7 July 2000. The main objective of the EAC is to foster regional economic integration.

In 2008, after negotiations with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the EAC agreed to an expanded free trade area including the member states of all three organizations. The EAC is an integral part of the African Economic Community.

The EAC is a potential precursor to the establishment of the East African Federation, a proposed federation of its members into a single sovereign state. In 2010, the EAC launched its own common market for goods, labour, and capital within the region, with the goal of creating a common currency and eventually a full political federation. In 2013, a protocol was signed outlining their plans for launching a monetary union within 10 years. In September 2018, a committee was formed to begin the process of drafting a regional constitution.

==History==

=== Formation and re-formation ===

Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda have cooperated with each other since the early 20th century. The East African Currency Board provided a common currency from 1919 to 1966. The customs union between Kenya and Uganda in 1917, which Tanganyika joined in 1927, was followed by the East African High Commission (EAHC) from 1948 to 1961, the East African Common Services Organization (EACSO) from 1961 to 1967, and the EAC from 1967 to 1977. Burundi and Rwanda joined the EAC on 6 July 2009.

Inter-territorial co-operation between the Kenya Colony, the Uganda Protectorate, and the Tanganyika Territory was formalised in 1948 by the EAHC. This provided a customs union, a common external tariff, currency, and postage. It also dealt with common services in transport and communications, research, and education. Following independence, these integrated activities were reconstituted and the EAHC was replaced by the EACSO, which many observers thought would lead to a political federation between the three territories. The new organisation ran into difficulties because of the lack of joint planning and fiscal policy, separate political policies, and Kenya&#x27;s dominant economic position. In 1967, the EACSO was superseded by the EAC. This body aimed to strengthen the ties between the members through a common market, a common customs tariff, and a range of public services to achieve balanced economic growth within the region.

In 1977, the EAC collapsed. The causes of the collapse included demands by Kenya for more seats than Uganda and Tanzania in decision-making organs, disagreements with Ugandan dictator Idi Amin who demanded that Tanzania as a member state of the EAC should not harbour forces fighting to topple the government of another member state, and the disparate economic systems of socialism in Tanzania and capitalism in Kenya. The three member states lost over sixty years of co-operation and the benefits of economies of scale, although some Kenyan government officials celebrated the collapse with champagne.

Presidents Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, and Yoweri Kaguta Museveni of Uganda signed the Treaty for East African Co-operation in Kampala on 1993 and established a Tri-partite Commission for Co-operation. A process of re-integration was embarked on involving tripartite programs of co-operation in political, economic, social and cultural fields, research and technology, defence, security, and legal and judicial affairs.

The EAC was revived on 30 November 1999, when the treaty for its re-establishment was signed. It came into force on 7 July 2000, 23 years after the collapse of the previous community and its organs. A customs union was signed in March 2004, which commenced on 1 January 2005. Kenya, the region&#x27;s largest exporter, continued to pay duties on goods entering the other four countries on a declining scale until 2010. A common system of tariffs will apply to goods imported from third-party countries. On 30 November 2016 it was declared that the immediate aim would be confederation rather than federation.

The presidents of Kenya and Rwanda invited the Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan to apply for membership upon the independence of South Sudan in 2011, and South Sudan was reportedly an applicant country as of mid-July 2011. Analysts suggested that South Sudan&#x27;s early efforts to integrate infrastructure, including rail links and oil pipelines, with systems in Kenya and Uganda indicated intention on the part of Juba to pivot away from dependence on Sudan and toward the EAC. Reuters considers South Sudan the likeliest candidate for EAC expansion in the short term, and an article in Tanzanian daily &quot;The Citizen&quot; that reported East African Legislative Assembly Speaker Abdirahin Haithar Abdi said South Sudan was &quot;free to join the EAC&quot; asserted that analysts believe the country will soon become a full member of the regional body.

On 17 September 2011, the &quot;Daily Nation&quot; quoted a South Sudanese MP as saying that while his government was eager to join the EAC, it would likely delay its membership over concerns that its economy was not sufficiently developed to compete with EAC member states and could become a &quot;dumping ground&quot; for Kenyan, Tanzanian, and Ugandan exports. This was contradicted by President Salva Kiir, who announced South Sudan had begun the application process one month later. The application was deferred by the EAC in December 2012, however incidents with Ugandan boda-boda operators in South Sudan have created political tension and may delay the process.

In December 2012, Tanzania agreed to South Sudan&#x27;s bid to join the EAC, clearing the way for the world&#x27;s newest state to become the regional bloc&#x27;s sixth member. In May 2013 the EAC set aside US$82,000 for the admission of South Sudan into the bloc even though admission may not happen until 2016. The process, to start after the EAC Council of Ministers meeting in August 2013, was projected to take at least four years. At the 14th Ordinary Summit held in Nairobi in 2012, EAC heads of state approved the verification report that was presented by the Council of Ministers, then directed it to start the negotiation process with South Sudan.

A team was formed to assess South Sudan&#x27;s bid; however, in April 2014, the nation requested a delay in the admissions process, presumably due to ongoing internal conflict.

South Sudan&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Barnaba Marial Benjamin, claimed publicly in October 2015 that, following evaluations and meetings of a special technical committee in May, June, August, September and October, the committee has recommended that South Sudan be allowed to join the East African Community. Those recommendations, however, had not been released to the public. It was reported that South Sudan could be admitted as early as November 2015 when the heads of East African States had their summit meeting.

South Sudan was eventually approved for membership to the bloc in March 2016, and signed a treaty of accession in April 2016. It had six months to ratify the agreement, which it did on 5 September, at which point it formally acceded to the community. It does not yet participate to the same extent as the other members.

=== Democratic Republic of the Congo&#x27;s accession ===

In 2010, Tanzanian officials expressed interest in inviting the DR Congo to join the East African Community. The DRC applied for admission to the EAC in June 2019. In June 2021, the EAC Summit launched a verification mission to assess the suitability of the DRC for admission to the Community, and has since drafted a report on their findings which is ready for submission to the EAC Council of Ministers. On 23 November 2021: Ministers in charge of East African Community (EAC) Affairs have recommended for consideration by the EAC Heads of States the report of the verification team on the application by The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to join the Community. In February 2022, the EAC Council of Ministers recommended that the DRC be admitted as a new member state of the EAC. On 18 March 2022, the EAC Secretary-General Peter Mathuki confirmed that the Heads of State would approve the admission on 29 March 2022. The Democratic Republic of the Congo was admitted as a member of the EAC on 29 March 2022, at a virtual Head of State summit chaired by Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, and officially became a member of the East African Community on 11 July 2022 after depositing the instrument of ratification with the EAC Secretary General at the bloc&#x27;s headquarters in Arusha, Tanzania. The accession of the DRC gives the EAC its first port on the West African coast.

=== Somalia&#x27;s accession ===

Representatives of Somalia applied for membership in the EAC in March 2012. The application was considered by the EAC Heads of State in December 2012, which requested that the EAC Council work with Somalia to verify their application. In February 2015, the EAC again deliberated on the matter but deferred a decision as verification had not yet started nor had preparations with the Somali government been finalized. During the 22nd Ordinary EAC Heads of State Summit on 22 July 2022, the EAC Heads of State, noted that the verification process for Somalia to join the community needs to be completed expeditiously. In 2023, East African Community (EAC) Secretary-General Peter Mathuki said Somalia had made a critical step towards becoming the eighth member of the bloc, with negotiations on admission set to last from 22 August to 5 September. Somalia was formally invited to join on 24 November 2023 during the 23rd ordinary summit of the heads of state, following a five-hour closed-door meeting. The treaty of accession was signed on 15 December 2023 at the presidential residence in Kampala, Uganda, with Somalia having 6 months to complete its ratification of the treaty after which it would officially become a member. On February 10, 2024, Somalia&#x27;s Parliament endorsed the treaty of accession. Somalia deposited its instruments of ratification on 4 March 2024, thus becoming the eighth member of the organisation.

==Partner states==

===Potential expansion===

====Comoros====

In July 2023 Kenyan President William Ruto raised the idea of Comoros joining the EAC while signing an agreement for deeper bilateral cooperation between Kenya and Comoros. Comoros and existing member Tanzania have a maritime border.

====Djibouti====

With Somalia set to join the group in October 2023, Secretary General Peter Mathuki stated, “The vision of our leaders is to have a market of 800 million people. And that will be possible if we integrate all the countries in the horn of Africa and make one huge market,” hinting of the possible accession of Djibouti and Ethiopia.

====Ethiopia====

Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta proposed expanding the EAC to include Central, Northern, and Southern African states, such as Ethiopia. The potential joining of Ethiopia into the EAC would bring the population to approximately 460 million. Speaking at the opening of the One Stop Border post in Moyale in 2020, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia affirmed his commitment to regional integration saying that the east African people are one people and economic integration is a key goal for the region to achieve so as to unlock its potential. With other horn of Africa countries like Somalia joining the EAC and the opening up of Ethiopia&#x27;s sectors such as banking and telecommunications to the private sector, being part of the EAC could soon become a priority to accelerate economic gains. In April 2023, Secretary General Peter Mathuki suggested the EAC should consider admitting Ethiopia following Somalia&#x27;s accession. On 8 April 2024, Ministry of EAC Arid and Semi-arid Lands and Regional Development Cabinet Secretary Peninah Malonza claimed the EAC and Ethiopia were in the final stages of negotiation for admission into the bloc. This was later contradicted by Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nebiu Tedla who said that Ethiopia had made no request to join the EAC and that &quot;the information is baseless.&quot;

====Malawi====

In 2010, Tanzanian officials expressed interest in inviting Malawi to join the EAC. Malawian Foreign Affairs Minister Etta Banda said, however, that there were no formal negotiations taking place concerning Malawian membership.

====Sudan====
Sudan applied to join the EAC in 2011, with Burundi, Kenya, and Rwanda supporting membership, while Tanzania and Uganda were opposed to it. They contended that because of the Sudan&#x27;s lack of a direct border with the EAC at the time, its allegedly discriminatory actions toward black Africans, its record of human rights violations, and its history of hostilities with both South Sudan and Uganda, Sudan was ineligible to join and their application was rejected in December 2012.

== EAC Organs ==
The Treaty for the Establishment of the East African Community established seven EAC Organs to perform the functions of the community.

=== The Summit ===
The Summit consists of the heads of state of each individual member country. The Summit gives &quot;strategic direction towards the realization of the goal and objectives of the Community,&quot; and convenes once per year, with additional meetings at request of any member of the Summit. The Summit&#x27;s decisions are arrived at by consensus. The Chairperson of the Summit&#x27;s tenure is one year and is in rotation from among the partner states. At Summit meetings, the Summit reviews annual progress reports and other reports from the Council. The summit appoints East African Court of Justice judges, assents to bills, and admits new member or observer states. The Summit may delegate many but not all of its powers to lower organs at the discretion of the Summit. The President of Kenya, William Ruto, serves as the current EAC Summit Chairperson.

=== The Council ===
The Council consists of the Minister responsible for EAC affairs of each member State, any other Minister of the member state the member state elects; and the Attorney General of each Partner State. The Council meets twice a year, one time directly after the Summit and once later in the year. The Council can also meet at the request of the Council Chairperson or member state. The Council main function is to implement decisions made by the Summit. The Council initiates and submits Bills to the Assembly, gives directions to the Partner States, and makes regulations, issues directives, and makes recommendations to all other organs (except the Summit, the Court, and the Assembly). The Council also can establish Sectoral Committees from amongst its members to implement specific directives. Deng Alor Kuol, the Minister for East African Community Affairs in South Sudan, is the current Chairperson of the EAC Council of Ministers. This position of Lead Council Chairperson is elected by the Head of State, and is replaced annually.

=== The Coordination Committee ===

The Co-ordination Committee consists of the Permanent Secretaries of EAC affairs in each member state and any other Permanent Secretaries as determined by the member state. The Coordination Committee meets at least twice a year preceding the meetings of the Council. The Coordination Committee implements the directives decided by the Council and recommends the creation of Sectoral Committees to the Council. The current acting Principal Secretary of the Coordinating Committee is Dr. Kevit Desai of Kenya.

=== East African Court of Justice ===

The East African Court of Justice is the judicial arm of the community and consists of the First Instance Division and an Appellate Division. The Judges are appointed by the Summit from candidates recommended by the member states provided there are no more than two judges of a member state on the First Instance Division and no more than one judge of a member state on the Appellate Division. The court is composed of a maximum of fifteen judges with no more than ten of the First Instance Division and no more than five of the Appellate Division. Each Judge may serve for no more than seven years and holds office until that period expires, death, reaching seventy years-of-age, or removal for misconduct by the Summit after deliberation from a tribunal, bankruptcy, or conviction. Upon suspension, the judge&#x27;s member state recommends a qualified candidate for appointment to temporary judge. If a judge has a conflict-of-interest, they are to report to their higher-up for deliberation on their ability to fairly judge. The court has jurisdiction over cases involving interpretation and application of the treaty, other jurisdiction as designated by the Summit, member states that consider another member state or EAC Organ to have failed obligations under the treaty, and disputes between the EAC and its employees. The Summit, the Council, or a Partner State may also request the Court to give an advisory opinion on an issue regarding the Treaty.

=== East African Legislative Assembly ===
The East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) is the legislative arm of the community. The EALA has 27 members who are all elected by the National Assemblies or Parliaments of the member states of the community. The EALA has oversight functions on all matters that fall within the community&#x27;s work and its functions include debating and approving the budget of the community, discussing all matters pertaining to the community and making recommendations to the council as it may deem necessary for the implementation of the treaty, liaising with National Assemblies or Parliaments on matters pertaining to the community and establishing committees for such purposes as it deems necessary. The Assemblypersons have a term of five years and a term limit of two. The EALA meets at least once a year and since being inaugurated in 2001, the EALA has had several sittings as a plenum in Arusha, Kampala, and Nairobi. Any member may introduce a bill and upon a simple majority vote, the bill proceeds to the Heads of State in which if any Head of State declines to assent within three months, the bill heads back to the EALA for editing.

As of August 2024, the Speaker of the Assembly is Dan Kidega from Uganda. He replaced former Speaker of the Assembly and Ugandan MP Margaret Zziwa after her impeachment. She had succeeded Abdirahin Haithar H. Abdi from Kenya. The assembly has been credited with crucial bills, particularly those regarding regional and international trade, including EAC&#x27;s stand on issues such as the World Trade Organization and transport on Lake Victoria.

=== The Secretariat ===
The Secretariat is the executive organ of the EAC. The highest office of the Secretariat is the Secretary General. The Secretary General is appointed by the summit upon nomination by the current rotational head of state and serves one five-year fixed term. The Secretariat also contains the offices of the Deputy Secretaries General appointed by the Summit and under the purview of the Secretary General. The Secretariat&#x27;s principle function is the implementation of the decisions of the Summit and the Council with other functions including research on best methods to achieve the EAC treaty&#x27;s goals, management of funds, and investigation of EAC affairs. Veronica Nduva is the current Secretary General of the EAC, having been appointed 7 June 2024 following Kenya&#x27;s recall of former EAC Secretary-General Peter Mathuki for alleged misallocation of six million in funds from the Peace Fund at the Secretariat.

=== EAC Institutions ===

There are eight current Heads of EAC Institutions. Vivienne Yeda Apopo of Zambia is the current acting Director-General of East African Economic Development and has had this position since 2009. Dr. Novat Twungubumwe of Burundi is the current acting Attorney General and Executive Secretary East African Health Research Commission. Dr. Sylvance Okeyo Okoth is the Executive Secretary of the East African Science and Technology Commission (EASTECO). Dr. Caroline Asiimwe of Uganda is the serving Executive Secretary of the East African Kiswahili Commission. Prof. Gaspard Banyankimbona of Uganda is the serving Executive Secretary of the Inter-University Council for East Africa. Eng. Richard Gatete of Rwanda is the serving executive director of the Civil Aviation Safety and Security Oversight Agency. Lilian K. Mukoronia of Kenya is the acting Registrar of the East African Community Competition Authority. Dr. Masinde K. Bwire is the serving Executive Secretary
Lake Victoria Basin Commission.

== Issues ==

=== Support ===

An EAC political union committee conducted a study on the support for the planned political union in the then-five member states from 2007 to 2009. Except for Tanzania, these committees found that the majority of their populations were in favour of further integration. While the committee continued to study integration until 2012, enthusiasm for the idea waned.

Surveying of Tanzania in 2012 by independent research group Afrobarometer revealed that 70% of Tanzanians approved of free movement of people, goods, and services. Meanwhile, 55% of Tanzanians approve the customs union and 54% approve of the proposed monetary union. On all three issues, share of people answering &quot;Don&#x27;t Know&quot; has more than halved since 2008 indicating higher rates of civic engagement on EAC issues. Approval of a joint army went from 26% in 2008 to 38% in 2012, with the majority (53%) still disapproving. In Kenya, approval for the free movement of people, goods, and services was at 52% as of 2021. Support for the monetary union sat at 49%, with 44% disapproving. 65% of those with no lived poverty approved of the free movement policy while only 44% of those with high lived poverty supported it. Surveying in May 2015 in Uganda found that 69% support free movement across borders in the region. In Burundi, 64% supported free movement among the region. A combined 56% of Ugandans thought the EAC &quot;helps a lot&quot;, &quot;helps somewhat&quot;, or &quot;helps a little&quot; in their country. 71% of Kenyans thought the EAC helps in some capacity while 57% of Tanzanians thought the EAC helps in some capacity.

Awareness of EAC Organs in Kenya is low; 43% had heard nothing of the EALA, with only 29% hearing &quot;some&quot; or &quot;a great deal&quot;. 47% of Kenyans said that their EALA representatives should be elected directly instead of elected by the Kenyan Parliament. 

Much of the support for East African integration comes from the national elites. Old enough to remember the former EAC, many are nostalgic for that period of East African politics and regret its eventual dissolution. However, 61% of the 18-25 demographic supported free movement in Kenya while only 43% of the 46-55 demographic supported it. This could be due to a growing sense of East African identity in the youth developing from modern communications. The group with highest support for free movement in Kenya was those with post-secondary education, with 73% supporting. 

=== Budget deficit ===
The EAC is critically underfunded due to defaulting member states. Kenya is the only member state to not have any standing debt while all other member states have significant arrears of some kind; As of November 2024, the DRC owes US$20 million, Burundi US$17 million, South Sudan US$15.6 million, Somalia US$7 million, Rwanda $5.2 million and Uganda US$3.4 million. Tanzania has been said to owe US$7 million though that number has been disputed by Secretary General Veronica Nduva. Somalia has contributed US$7.8 million following its accession, putting it ahead of the DRC which, despite accessing in 2019, had yet to remit a cent until 2024 when it remitted US$1 million to the EAC. In the 2023–24 fiscal year, arrears amounted to over US$35 million. Reasons for these arrears are primarily due to two factors: 
* Failure to enforce contributions via sanctions outlined in the treaty
* Member states&#x27;s contributions to the budget are equal despite their varying sizes and GDPs
The equal-share model was adopted when the EAC comprised only Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, and may no longer be sustainable. An alternate payment model has been proposed in which 65% of the budget is contributed to equally, while the remaining 35% is contributed to on the basis of each member states&#x27; respective average nominal GDP in the past five years. EALA Chairperson of the Budget Committee Ken Mukulia suggests amendments to the EAC legal instruments to distribute power according to size of contribution should accompany the new financing model. Additionally, auctioning stranded goods in the ports of Dar es Salaam and Mombasa slated for the three major defaulters has been suggested as a method of paying off their debt. Both Mukulia and Rwandan President Paul Kagame have proposed sanctioning defaulting member states.

Despite calls for reform, the financial year 2024/2025 EAC budget will be contributed to equally. 61% of that budget will be equally contributed from member states or raised by internal revenue while 39% will be sourced from development partners. The budget for financial year 2024/25 is US$112.98 million, a 8.7% increase from last financial year. The majority of this increase has been attributed to Somalia&#x27;s accession. As of 25 November 2024, only US$13.3 million of the $89.5 million budget for financial year 2024/2025 has been remitted. Chairperson of the EALA Budget Committee Ayason Mukulia stated that the failure in remission may stem from hesitancy following the misallocation of US$6 million in funds from the Secretariat by former Secretary General Peter Mathuki. Member states have reportedly refused to remit funds until a full audit is conducted.

===DRC-EAC tensions===
====The M23 offensive====

The March 23 Movement, a Congolese rebel military group composed mostly of ethnic Tutsi, waged a rebellion in the northeastern DRC from 2012 to 2013. M23 was formed by deserters of the DRC Armed Forces (FARDC) who had previously been members of the CNDP rebel group and been dissatisfied with the conditions of their service. Both the CNDP as well as the March 23 Movement&#x27;s first rebellion were supported by Rwanda and Uganda. A United Nations report found that Rwanda created and commanded the M23 rebel group. Rwanda ceased its support because of international pressure and the military defeat by the DRC and the UN in 2013. After agreeing to a peace deal, M23 was largely dismantled, its fighters disarmed and moved into refugee camps in Uganda. In 2017, an M23 splinter group fled Uganda to Kivu to resume their insurgency, however, the operation achieved little as the M23 no longer enjoyed significant international support. Uganda and the DRC had greatly improved relations, cooperating against a common enemy in the Allied Democratic Forces during Operation Shujaa. In early 2022, a growing number of M23 combatants began leaving their camps and move back to the DR Congo; the rebel movement launched more attacks in February 2022, but these were repelled. The M23 leadership argued that parts of their movement had resumed the insurgency because the conditions of the 2013 peace deal were not being honored by the DRC government. The rebels also argued that they were attempting to defend Kivu&#x27;s Tutsi minority from attacks by Hutu militants such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). This follows a long trend of Hutu-Tutsi violence, exemplified by the Burundi genocide of 1993 and the Rwandan genocide of 1994, the latter having been stopped by current President of Rwanda Paul Kagame, an ethnic Tutsi who has remained in power over the Hutu-majority country since the end of the genocide. 

On 6 April 2022, the FARDC rejected any negotiations with the M23 forces based in the DR Congo, and started a counter-attack. However, as the FARDC was increasingly losing ground to the insurgents, the DRC government and a number of rebel groups held peace talks in Nairobi in late April, only for the offensive to resume in May. In late May, insurgents temporarily seized Rumangabo before it was retaken by the FARDC. According to independent researchers, the insurgents were supported by Rwandan soldiers during the battle for Rumangabo. Following months of attempts, on 13 June 2022, M23 captured the town of Bunagana. FARDC spokesman Sylvain Ekenge declared that the fall of Bunagana constituted &quot;no less than an invasion&quot; by Rwanda. Two senior Congolese security sources and members of the Congolese parliament also accused Uganda of supporting the rebel offensive. The Congolese MPs claimed that the retreat of the Uganda People&#x27;s Defense Force before the rebel attack had facilitated the takeover of Bunagana. The DRC ended military cooperation with Uganda, leading to Uganda subsequently halting Operation Shujaa. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta responded to the fall of Bunagana and the growing regional tensions by calling for the EAC to immediately organize a new peacekeeping mission called the East African Community Regional Force to restore security in the eastern DR Congo. An EAC meeting was organized in Nairobi to discuss the diplomatic tensions between the DRC, Rwanda, and Uganda, as well as the deployment of a new peacekeeping force. The DRC declared that it would welcome an EAC peacekeeping mission but only under the condition of Rwanda&#x27;s exclusion from the operation. The EAC subsequently called on M23 to retreat from Bunagana as precondition for a ceasefire, but the insurgents rejected the order. Anti-Rwandan protests broke out on 31 October in Goma, demanding that the DRC leave the EAC and that Russia intervene in the conflict. On 2 November, Kenya announced that it would send 900 soldiers to fight against the M23. The Ugandan military then joined the Kenyan troops in fighting the M23. On 28 December 2022, South Sudan sent a contingency of 750 troops to join the EACRF, to be stationed in Goma. Over the next few months, the EACRF made some ground, with various towns being ceded to the EACRF. On 3 April, Ugandan EACRF soldiers entered Bunagana. However, instead of taking the city, the EACRF coexisted with the rebel forces. A similar arrangement was also observed at Rumangabo, where Kenyans and M23 inhabited the same base, and along the Sake-Kilolirwe-Kitshanga-Mwesso axis, where Burundian and rebel forces operated next to each other.

In October 2023, the DRC ordered the EAC force in the country to leave by 8 December, due to a &quot;lack of satisfactory results on the ground&quot;. On 19 December 2023, the last of the EACRF forces had withdrawn from the Eastern DRC. To replace the EACRF, SADC forces on 15 December 2023 were deployed to the region to “restore peace and security in the eastern DRC”. Kenyan President William Ruto and Angolan President João Lourenço met in 8 January 2025 to discuss consolidating EAC and SADC efforts in peacemaking in the conflict area.

In January 2025, Goma was again the target of a renewed offensive by the Rwandan-backed M23 rebels. The heads of state of both Rwanda and the DRC agreed to attend a peace summit hosted by Kenya at the invitation of President William Ruto. The emergency meeting, involving all East African Community member states, was held on 29 January 2025 with Rwanda&#x27;s Kagame but not DRC&#x27;s Tshisekedi, who cancelled his participation. The organization called for an immediate ceasefire and for Congo to negotiate with the M23.

====Rumours of DRC exit====

At the 24th Ordinary Summit held in November 2024, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, expected to take over as Summit Chairperson, neither attended nor sent a representative, with Kenyan President William Ruto elected to the position instead. This follows a series of absences by Tshisekedi, including the 23rd Extraordinary Summit, held on 7 June 2024 to appoint Veronica Mueni Nduva as Secretary General. Insiders at the Secretariat have stated that the DRC rarely takes part in meetings and as of 22 June 2024, the DRC has yet to align its legal instruments with the EAC as per the treaty. The DRC has implemented free movement of people however otherwise has not integrated to the extent the other member states have. The DRC is required to remit money yearly to the EAC as part of its membership; however, despite accessing in 2019, it had failed to remit a cent until 2024 when it remitted US$1 million to the EAC. The DRC still owes a total of US$20 million.

Analysts have suggested that the DRC’s continued absence is a boycott in response to Kenyan President William Ruto’s stance on the M23 conflict. At a summit meeting, there was a discussion on if the M23 were Rwandan or Congolese. Ruto said “the DRC told us: ‘They are Congolese.’ End of the debate. If they are Congolese, how does this become a Rwandan problem? How does this become a Kagame problem?”

Former Foreign Minister of the DRC Christophe Lutundula said the DRC strategy was “to join the Eastern bloc, of course for regional integration and economic reasons, but also to better plead the Congo’s security cause, where Rwanda is making its voice heard,” suggesting that EAC accession to the EAC was in large part due to counteracting Rwanda&#x27;s influence in the bloc. Congolese legislators in the EALA said the DRC was not considering quitting the EAC, but that the decision was up to President Tshisekedi.

MP Bertran Ewanga, head of the DRC chapter of the EALA, suggested that additional tension arose from a statement by Kenyan President William Ruto during a state dinner with U.S. President Joe Biden, although the specific statement that caused the tension is unknown. DRC Spokesman Patrick Muyaya said the peace in Kivu was taking too long to be realised and that “some Congolese are now questioning why we even asked to join the EAC.” He also said the DRC is &quot;happier in the SADC than in the EAC,&quot; reflecting the EACRF&#x27;s replacement at request of Tshisekedi with SADC forces.

Tshisekedi recalled the ambassador of the DRC to Kenya in December 2023 and has yet to accredit the new Kenyan ambassador to the DRC due to disagreements surrounding the Congo River Alliance, a group including DRC politicians and various secessionist militias including the M23. Tshisekedi demanded that Kenya hand over any persons engaging in &quot;subversive activities,&quot; to which Kenyan foreign minister Musalia Mudavadi said “Kenya strongly disassociates itself from any utterances or activities likely to injure the peace and security of the friendly nation of DRC and has commenced an investigation.” Ultimately, Kenya found the statements to fall under constitutionally protected speech.

The DRC&#x27;s entry into the EAC was facilitated by Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, Ruto&#x27;s predecessor and a friend to Tshisekedi. Ruto is seen as reversing the positions that allowed the DRC to join in the first place. DRC Opposition leader Martin Fayulu has called the DRC’s membership in the EAC a “big mistake”. The EAC treaty has no provisions for the forcible exit of a member state, with only sanctions having been outlined. During the 7 June 2024 Summit, Paul Kagame called for a meeting of the Council of Ministers to discuss peace in the region.

Despite conflicts, Secretary General Veronica Nduva said in November 2024 that the DRC is finalising a review of its policy and legal framework to align with EAC protocols, including waiving visa requirements for citizens of all EAC partner States.

=== Somali integration ===

As of July 2024, Somalia is active in an ongoing civil war. The main insurgent group is the Al-Qaeda-linked, Sunni Islamist military Al-Shabaab. Although based in Somalia, its reach extends all the way to Kampala, Uganda, where it killed 76 people in a 2010 Kampala bombings. As a result of the ongoing civil war, Somalia topped the annual Fragile States Index for six years from 2008 up to and including 2013. Troops from Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Burundi and Djibouti have fought Al-Shabaab since 2007, first as the African Union Mission to Somalia then as African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS). However, as of July 2024, 5,000 soldiers have left Somalia as ATMIS prepares to leave Somalia by December 2024. Recently, Al-Shabaab have allied with the Ugandan rebel group, the Allied Democratic Forces, trading arms and training for illegally-mined minerals from the Eastern DRC. Al-Shabaab has also created a sect of foreign fighters called the Muhajirin, including primarily Kenyan, Ethiopian and Tanzanian nationals, but also some Congoleses, Burundians, Rwandans and Ugandans. In 2024, Al-Shabaab recaptured much of the land captured by the retreating ATMIS.

Most of Somalia operates independently from its federal government. Somaliland, an internationally unrecognized state within the borders of Somalia, released a statement following Somalia’s accession into the EAC stating that the “decision is a clear violation of Somaliland&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” and called for the EAC, the African Union, and the United Nations to recognize their statehood. In addition, Puntland has temporarily withdrawn until the constitutional amendments concentrating power under president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud are approved in a nationwide referendum. These conflicts have caused the federal government to control only around ten percent of its internationally-recognized territory as of May 2024.

===Differences in modes of governance===
Despite efforts at integration and standardizing governance, there remains significant political differences between the states. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni&#x27;s success in obtaining his third-term amendment raised doubts in the other countries. The single-party dominance in the Tanzanian and Ugandan parliaments is unattractive to Kenyans, while Kenya&#x27;s ethnic-politics remains absent in Tanzania. Rwanda has a distinctive political culture with a political elite committed to building a developmental state.

These differences in modes of governance was exemplified when South Sudanese President Salva Kiir Mayardit was appointed chairperson of the EAC in November 2023. This decision was criticized by some regional observers including Duop Chak Wuol, an influential South Sudanese analyst, who criticized the appointment of Kiir, seeing it as evidence of the EAC failure to uphold its moral obligations and accused the bloc of ignoring what he described as Salva Kiir&#x27;s tyranny. Many have argued that support for East African integration from local politicians grants often corrupt politicians with the ability to present themselves as statesmen and representatives of a greater regional interest. Furthermore, EAC institutions bring significant new powers to dispose and depose to those who serve in them.

==Economics==

===Importance of the customs union===

The key aspects of the customs union include:
# a Common External Tariff (CET) on imports from third countries;
# duty-free trade between the member states; and
# common customs procedures.

Since July 2022, the CET has four main duty rates: 
# 35% duty on finished products
# 25% duty on intermediate products available in the EAC region
# 10% duty on intermediate products not available in the EAC region
# 0% duty on raw materials and capital goods

However rates still vary on some individual products, such as an 100% duty on sugar. There are also some additional &quot;sensitive items&quot; which exceed the 35% duty rate including dairy products, maize, rice, and woven fabrics. Kenya was granted a temporary exception to the CET to import grain at a lower tariff to meet local demand and increase food security. The rules regulating what counts as a domestic vs foreign product is regulated by the Rules of Origin (RoO). The RoO is expected to be updated every five years however has not been updated since 2015. The customs union is not yet exercised in the full extent of the promise. For instance, Kenya still holds excise duties on many products, raising excise duty rates in 2023. And although Kenya recently loosened certain duties, they still haven&#x27;t enacted full free movement of goods. This also means that countries outside of the EAC must still navigate local tax and duties opposed to a singular tax policy, simplifying the process of investing in EAC member states. For EAC internal trade in the third quarter of 2023, Tanzania was the biggest exporter with US$798.12 million, Uganda was the biggest importer with US$649.3 million, and Rwanda had the highest internal EAC in trade deficit of US$375.23 million. Intra-regional trade currently stands at 15% of EAC trade according to Summit Chairman Salva Kiir, which was deemed unsatisfactory.

===Common market===

On 1 July 2010, the EAC launched the Common Market Protocol, an expansion of the bloc&#x27;s existing customs union that entered into effect in 2005. Corruption has led to some integration initiatives being underfunded. The full adoption of the common market has been undermined by continued protectionism between member states, with decisions driven by political pressures on national leaders slowing down the implementation of commitments to integration, even within founding members. Bilateral political tensions have led to border controls in some periods, further undermining the shared labour market. In 2024, Rwanda closed its borders with Burundi and the DRC, after a previous three-year closure of its border with Uganda in 2019. In January 2023, Burundi closed its border with Rwanda after President Evariste Ndayishimiye accused Rwanda of hosting and training the RED-Tabara rebel group. 

Despite border closings, an immense amount of inter-EAC migration is still occurring; From July to December 2023, around 376,000 citizens emigrated to Rwanda from other EAC member states, including around 76,500 Burundians. In turn, Burundi received around 251,500 citizens from other EAC member states, including 110,500 Rwandans. South Sudan received 69,584 citizens, half of which were from Uganda.

In 2010, the introduction of &quot;third generation&quot; ID cards was planned. These cards identify the holder as a dual citizen of their home country and of &quot;East Africa&quot;. Third generation cards are already in use in Rwanda with Kenya set to introduce them in July 2010 and the other countries following afterwards. An East African passport was launched on 1999 in the original three countries of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The 17th Ordinary Summit held on 2 March 2016 launched the East African electronic passport. Tanzania started issuing the EA e-passport on 31 January 2018; Kenya and Burundi on 28 May 2018; Uganda on 18 December 2018 and Rwanda on 28 June 2019. South Sudan, the DRC and Somalia are still establishing the legal framework to start issuing the document. Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda, allow citizens to travel within their territories using a national ID as a travel document. Kenya in December 2024 introduced the Class R work permit allowing any EAC national to work in Kenya free of charge. Tanzania, DRC, Somalia, Burundi, and South Sudan still charge EAC nationals for work permits. Mutual recognition and accreditation of higher education institutions is also being worked towards as is the harmonisation of social security benefits across the EAC.

===Emerging business trends===

Business leaders are far more positive than economists about the benefits of EAC integration, its customs union as a step in the process, as well as the wider integration under COMESA. The larger economic players perceive long-term benefits in a progressively expanding regional market. Patterns of regional development are already emerging, including:
* Kenyan firms have successfully aligned to the lower protection afforded by the EAC CET and fears that firms would not adjust to a 25% maximum CET, or would relocate to Tanzania or Uganda have not been realised.
* An intraregional division of labour is developing, which results in basic import-processing relocating to the coast to supply the hinterland. The final stages of import-processing (especially those bulky finished goods that involve high transportation costs) and natural-resource based activities are moving up-country and up-region, either within value chains of large companies or different segments located by firms in different countries.
* Trade in goods and services has already increased as service provision to Kenyans and Tanzanians is already important for Uganda (in education and in health). Kenya exports financial services, for example via the Kenya Commercial Bank and purchase and upgrading of local operators in Tanzania, Uganda and Sudan. Uganda hopes integration will help support its tourism potential through integration with established regional circuits.
* There are signs of a business culture oriented to making profits through economies of scale and not on protectionism.
* Kenya historically has been the leader in intraregional trade. For the first time in 2024, Tanzania overtook Kenya&#x27;s position, leading regional trade.
Due to the DRC&#x27;s accession into the EAC, Congolese in Kisangani and Goma are now receiving their goods through ports in Mombasa and Dar es Salaam. The success of this new trade route has caused the DRC and South Sudan to integrate revenue systems to streamline cargo documentation, hastening the rate at which goods are cleared through the Port of Mombassa. The eastern region of the DRC currently has plentiful mining operations, in particular the mining of Cobalt. The mining sector of the EAC contributes around 2.3% of the GDP, with gold being the second highest exported product following petroleum in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the Southeastern DRC lays the copperbelt, known for its copper mining. The copper is currently majority exported via road with the exception of the Lobito Atlantic Railway, which stretches from the Lobito, Angola to Kolwezi. However, the Lobito Corridor project, with $250 million in U.S. financial investment, would construct around 550 km (350 miles) of railway in Zambia along the Zambia-DRC border, with feeder roads connecting DRC copper mines to the new railway.

===Trade negotiations===

On 16 July 2008, the United States and the EAC signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, strengthening United States-EAC trade. The U.S. exported $1.1 billion and imported $1.3 billion from the EAC in 2022. This shifted the net goods traded from a total trade deficit of $211 million in 2021 to a trade surplus of $135 million in 2022. In Q4 2024, the EAC exported US$6.3 Billion. Out of trade partners, the top five were China, the United Arab Emirates, India, South Africa, and Malaysia. The top importer of EAC goods was the UAE and the top source of inputed goods was China. Trade with COMESA accounted for 11.5% of total EAC Trade while trade with SADC accounted for 12.9. On 2 December 2024, Germany and the EAC signed a development cooperation agreement committing 64€ million from Germany to be invested in the EAC. Out of that, 23€ million goes towards pandemic preparedness and combatting disease and 5€ million goes towards environmental conservation.

===Poverty reduction===

EAC that have economies have large informal sectors, unintegrated with the formal economy and large business. The concerns of large-scale manufacturing and agro-processing concerns are not broadly shared by the bulk of available labour. Research suggest the promised investments on the conditions of life of the region&#x27;s overwhelmingly rural poor will be slight, with the significant exception of agro-industrial firms with out-grower schemes or that otherwise contribute to the co-ordination of smallholder production and trade.

It is informal trade across borders that is most often important to rural livelihoods and a customs union is unlikely to significantly impact the barriers that this faces and taxes are still being fixed separately by countries. However, the introduction of one-stop border posts being introduced and the reduction in tariff barriers are coming down progressively.

The establishment of a common market will create both winners (numerous food producers and consumers on both sides of all borders) and losers (smugglers and the customs, police and local government officers who currently benefit from bribery at and around the borders) in the border areas. More substantial impact could be attained by a new generation of investments in world-market production based on the region&#x27;s comparative advantages in natural resources (especially mining and agriculture) and the new tariff structure creates marginally better conditions for world-market exporters, by cheapening inputs and by reducing upward pressures on the exchange rate.

==Plans==

The new treaty was proposed with plans drawn up in 2004 to introduce a monetary union with a common currency some time between 2012 and 2015. There were also plans for a political union, the East African Federation, with a common President (initially on a rotation basis) and a common parliament by 2010. However, some experts, like those based in the public think tank Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA), noted that the plans were too ambitious to be met by 2010 because a number of political, social and economic challenges are yet to be addressed. The proposal was the subject of National Consultative discussions, and a final decision was to be taken by the EAC Heads of State in mid-2007. In 2013, a protocol was signed outlining their plans for launching a monetary union within 10 years. There are concerns that rapid integration would enflame popular reactionary politics against the project. However it&#x27;s also been argued that, with high costs that would be required at the beginning, fast-tracking the project would allow the benefits to be seen earlier. 

Given the infrastructure problems that persist in the fledgling country since South Sudanese President Salva Kiir cut off oil commerce with Sudan, the state has decided to invest in constructing pipelines that circumvent Sudan&#x27;s, which it had been using until that time. These new pipelines would extend through Ethiopia to the ports of Djibouti, as well as to the southeast to the coast of Kenya.

In September 2018, a committee was formed to begin the process of drafting a regional constitution.

In January 2023, the East African Community plans to issue a single currency within the next four years. The Council of Ministers of the organization must decide on the location of the East African Monetary Institute and the establishment of a roadmap for the issuance of the single currency.

===Coalition of the Willing===
A &quot;Coalition of the Willing&quot;, made up of Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, began a number of initiatives amongst themselves including joint railway and oil pipeline projects, a joint tourist visa, and a defence and security pact, to get around reluctance from other members. However, even within this grouping, progress on projects has been delayed. Bilateral friction between members, a lack of enthusiasm, and political instability have been the primary reasons behind the delaying and weakening of integration efforts.

===Single tourist visa===

It had been hoped that an East African Single Tourist Visa may have been ready for November 2006, if it was approved by the relevant sectoral authorities under the EAC&#x27;s integration programme. Had it been approved, the visa would have been valid for all three current member states of the EAC (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda). Under the proposal for the visa, any new EAC single visa could be issued by any member state&#x27;s embassy. The visa proposal followed an appeal by the tourist boards of the partner states for a common visa to accelerate promotion of the region as a single tourist destination and the EAC Secretariat wanted it approved before November&#x27;s World Travel Fair (or World Travel Market) in London. When approved by the EAC&#x27;s council of ministers, tourists could apply for one country&#x27;s entry visa which would then be applicable in all regional member states as a single entry requirement initiative.

A single East African Tourist Visa for the EAC countries of Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda has been available since 2014.

==Demographics==

The population of the constituent parts of the EAC is composed of 65% under 30-year-olds. This youth bulge is anticipated to grow to 75% of the population under the age of 25 in this region by 2030.

The East African Community&#x27;s current urban population stands at about 20%.

===Languages===

English is the official language of the EAC. Kiswahili was designated for development as the lingua franca of the community in 2000 with French added as a lingua franca in 2021. Given this, there is an ongoing effort to elevate French to an official language, with France and the EAC signing an agreement in March 2020 to elevate French as an official language of the EAC alongside English. France is financing around €42,500 toward the project, which has seen delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Numerous local languages are also spoken: for example, there are 56 local languages spoken in Uganda, 125 in Tanzania, 72 in South Sudan and 67 local languages in Kenya. Kinyarwanda is spoken in Rwanda and Uganda. There are over 200 local languages spoken in the DRC. Lingala is widely spoken in the western Democratic Republic of Congo, with about 15 million speakers and Kiswahili with 23 million speakers across the country.

<text>Nasal sprays are used to deliver medications locally in the nasal cavities or systemically. They are used locally for conditions such as nasal congestion and allergic rhinitis. In some situations, the nasal delivery route is preferred for systemic therapy because it provides an agreeable alternative to injection or pills. Substances can be assimilated extremely quickly and directly through the nose. Many pharmaceutical drugs exist as nasal sprays for systemic administration (e.g. sedative-analgesics, treatments for migraine, osteoporosis and nausea). Other applications include hormone replacement therapy, treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Nasal sprays are seen as a more efficient way of transporting drugs with potential use in crossing the blood–brain barrier.

==Antihistamines==
Antihistamines work by competing for receptor sites to block the function of histamine, thereby reducing the inflammatory effect. Antihistamine nasal sprays include:
* Azelastine hydrochloride
* Levocabastine hydrochloride
* Olopatadine hydrochloride

==Corticosteroids==
Corticosteroid nasal sprays can be used to relieve the symptoms of sinusitis, hay fever, allergic rhinitis and non-allergic (perennial) rhinitis. They can reduce inflammation and histamine production in the nasal passages, and have been shown to relieve nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose and sneezing. Side effects may include headaches, nausea and nose bleeds. Corticosteroid nasal sprays include:
* Beclomethasone dipropionate
* Budesonide
* Ciclesonide
* Flunisolide
* Fluticasone furoate
* Fluticasone propionate
* Mometasone
* Triamcinolone acetonide

==Saline==
Saline sprays are typically non-medicated. A mist of saline solution containing sodium chloride is delivered to help moisturize dry or irritated nostrils. This is a form of nasal irrigation. They can also relieve nasal congestion and remove airborne irritants such as pollen and dust thereby providing sinus allergy relief.

Three types of nasal sprays preparations of sodium chloride are available including hypertonic (3% sodium chloride or sea water), isotonic (0.9% sodium chloride) and hypotonic (0.65% sodium chloride). Isotonic solutions have the same salt concentration as the human body, whereas hypertonic solutions have a higher salt content and hypotonic solutions have a lower salt content. Isotonic saline nasal sprays are commonly used in infants and children to wash out the thick mucus from the nose in case of allergic rhinitis. Hypertonic solutions may be more useful at drawing moisture from the mucous membrane and relieving nasal congestion.

Natural nasal sprays that include chemical complexes derived from plant sources such as ginger, capsaicin and tea-tree oil are also available. There is however no trial-verified evidence that they have a measurable effect on symptoms.

==Topical decongestants==
Decongestant nasal sprays are available over-the-counter in many countries. They work to very quickly open up nasal passages by constricting blood vessels in the lining of the nose. Prolonged use of these types of sprays can damage the delicate mucous membranes in the nose. This causes increased inflammation, an effect known as rhinitis medicamentosa or the rebound effect. Decongestant nasal sprays are advised for short-term use only, preferably 5 to 7 days at maximum. Some doctors advise to use them 3 days at maximum. A recent clinical trial has shown that a corticosteroid nasal spray may be useful in reversing this condition. Topical nasal decongestants include:
* Oxymetazoline
* Phenylephrine
* Xylometazoline

==Allergy combinations==
Combination use of two medications are available as nasal sprays.

List of some combination nasal sprays:
* Azelastine together with fluticasone propionate (brand names including Dymista)&lt;ref name=&quot;Dymista/Dylastine&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Xylometazoline together with cromoglicic acid

In some countries, Dymista is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn merged with Mylan to create Viatris.

In 2022, the combination azelastine/fluticasone was the 299th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 300,000 prescriptions.

<text>Gudauta (, ; , &quot;Gwdowtha&quot;; , &quot;Gudauta&quot;) is a town in Abkhazia, Georgia, and a center of the eponymous district. It is situated on the Black Sea, 37 km northwest of Sokhumi, the capital of Abkhazia. It is the namesake for the Gudauta Bay.

==Air Base==
Gudauta used to be home to a Soviet Air Defence Forces base, Bombora airfield, where the 171st Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment flew Su-15TMs until 1982. The 171st Fighter Aviation Regiment was then transferred to Anadyr Ugolny Airport, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. The 529th Fighter Aviation Regiment, flew Su-27 &#x27;Flankers&#x27; from the base in the last years of the Cold War. This regiment was under the command of the 19th Army of the Air Defence Forces. Gudauta was a center of Abkhaz separatist resistance to Georgian government forces during the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict in 1992–1993.

Bombora airfield outside Gudauta later became home to a Soviet Airborne Forces unit, the 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment, later redesignated the 50th military base after the Soviet collapse, and then the 10th Independent Peacekeeping Airborne Regiment. The unit was subordinated directly to the Russian General Staff (earlier it used to be under the HQ of the Russian Airborne Forces).

In 1999, its equipment included 142 AIFV/APC (among them - 62 BMD-1 and 11 BMD-2); and 11 self-propelled artillery systems 2S9 &quot;Nona-S&quot;.

The base has always been a significant factor in the Abkhaz conflict. The Georgian side and many Western independent observers claim the Gudauta base provided principal military support to Abkhaz rebels during the war in 1992–1993. In September 1995, Georgia had to legitimize Russian leases of three bases in the country and the Gudauta base among them.

At a summit of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), in Istanbul in 1999, Russia agreed to shut down its base at Gudauta and to withdraw troops and equipment, pledging that henceforth it would be for the sole use of the CIS peacekeepers (&quot;rehabilitation centre for peacekeeping troops&quot;). However, Abkhaz authorities block OSCE inspection visits and no date is set for withdrawal from the base. Georgia still alleges that it is used to offer military support to the Abkhaz secessionists.

After the Russo-Georgian War, Russia recognized Abkhazia and signed with its government the treaty allowing Russia to keep its military base in Gudauta and reinforce it with T-62 tanks, light armored vehicles, S-300 air defense systems and several aircraft.

The Gudauta base remains one of the main problems in complicated Russian-Georgian relations.

<text>Patrick Chappatte (known simply as Chappatte) (b. February 22, 1967, in Karachi, Pakistan) is a Lebanese-Swiss cartoonist known for his work for &quot;Le Temps&quot;, &quot;NZZ am Sonntag&quot;, the German news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, &quot;The New York Times International Edition&quot; and the French satirical newspaper &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot;. He also worked as an illustrator for the &quot;New York Times&quot; and as cartoonist for &quot;Newsweek&quot;. Many of his cartoons reflect events in Swiss and international news, such as the September 11 attacks, the rise of the Swiss People&#x27;s Party, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

== Biography ==
Born to a Lebanese mother and a Swiss father in Karachi, Pakistan, Chappatte was raised in Singapore and Switzerland.

Chappatte lives between Los Angeles and Geneva.

== Career ==
=== Editorial cartoons ===
Patrick Chappatte drew a twice-weekly cartoon in the Opinion section of &quot;The New York Times International Edition&quot;, formerly known as the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, which published his work from 2001 to 2019 (when the paper stopped publishing editorial cartoons altogether).

Over the years, he has collaborated with editorial cartoonists in conflict-ridden countries with the goal of promoting dialogue through cartooning. These projects focused on Serbia, Ivory Coast, Lebanon, Kenya and Guatemala. He described the work in a TED talk in 2010. His work is syndicated by Cagle Cartoons.

=== Comics journalism ===
Since 1995, Chappatte has worked in graphic journalism, or comics journalism, a genre of reporting using the techniques of graphic novels. His most recent stories covered the war in Gaza (2009), the slums of Nairobi (2010) and gang violence in Central America (2012). These reports were published in several newspapers, including the &quot;New York Times&quot;; one was turned into a short animated documentary in 2011. (see below)

In May 2016, Chappatte (with his wife, journalist Anne-Frédérique Widmann) published &quot;Inside Death Row,&quot; a five-part series published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; about the death penalty in the United States.

=== Animated documentary ===
Chappatte went to southern Lebanon in 2009, where people still live with the threat of actual time bombs, in the form of cluster munition bomblets. While there, Chappatte created a report in comic-book format: &quot;Death in the Field&quot;, which was published in &quot;Le Temps&quot;. The report was released in 2011 as an animated documentary. It was aired on Swiss and French TV, toured documentary festivals, and won an award in Australia. Chappatte said the process of creating the documentary was both a personal and professional endeavor. &quot;I have a Swiss father and a Lebanese mother, so I wanted to better understand the problems that the people of Lebanon are still facing, long after the fighting stopped,&quot; he said. &quot;I also wanted to use my craft as a cartoonist, my experience as a journalist and my sense of satire to create a new kind of prism through which to view forgotten conflicts and a new technique for revealing the humanity behind the story.&quot;

== Awards ==
In 2012, Chappatte became the first non-American to win the Overseas Press Club of America’s Thomas Nast Award for best cartoons on international affairs. He would be awarded this prize twice more: in 2016 and 2019.

In February 2013, he received the 2012 Audience Award from the Swiss satirical journal &quot;Nebelspalter&quot;.

In 2017, the Swiss association &quot;Films Plans-Fixes&quot; produced a documentary tracing his career.

In 2020, the Swiss &quot;Fondation pour Genève&quot; awarded him its annual prize &quot;for his exceptional contribution to the influence of Geneva and for his commitment to freedom of the press and expression&quot;.

<text>Giovanni Spadolini (21 June 1925 – 4 August 1994) was an Italian politician and statesman, who served as the 44th prime minister of Italy. He had been a leading figure in the Republican Party and the first head of a government to not be a member of Christian Democrats since 1945. He was also a newspaper editor, journalist and historian. He is considered a highly respected intellectual for his literary works and his cultural dimension.

Professor of Contemporary History at the University of Florence, he was the author of numerous historical works. He was also a journalist and editor-in-chief of the Bolognese newspaper &quot;Il Resto del Carlino&quot;, then of the Milanese newspaper &quot;Il Corriere della Sera&quot;.

Spadolini was the first Italian Minister of Cultural Heritage and Environment from 1974 to 1976. He became Prime Minister in 1981 and he led two successive cabinets which were supported by a coalition of parties in Parliament but this only lasted a few months. He was Minister of Defence in the governments headed by Socialist leader Bettino Craxi from 1983 to 1987 before being elected President of the Senate. In 1991, Spadolini was appointed Lifetime Senator by President Francesco Cossiga.

==Early life==
Spadolini was born into a bourgeois family: his father Guido Spadolini was a Macchiaioli painter, owner of a large library in which the young Giovanni studied and began to form his culture inspired by secular, liberal-democratic and republican values. He was an assiduous student, brilliant in all subjects, at &quot;Liceo Classico Statale Galileo&quot;. He published his first article in 1944 in &quot;Italia e Civiltà&quot; (&quot;Italy and Civilisation&quot;), a fascist periodical critical of the excesses of fascism in which the idealist philosopher Giovanni Gentile also collaborated.

During the post-war period (from 1945 to 1950) Spadolini became a moderate liberal conservative. He also rejected antisemitism in favour of Zionism. He studied law at the University of Florence and shortly after graduation was appointed Professor of Contemporary History in the Faculty of Political Science. He also became a political columnist for several newspapers, such as &quot;Il Borghese&quot;, &quot;Il Messaggero&quot; and &quot;Il Mondo&quot;, becoming editor-in-chief of the Bologna paper &quot;Il Resto del Carlino&quot; in 1955, doubling its circulation during his tenure. In 1968, Spadolini moved to Milan where he took over the editorship of Italy&#x27;s largest newspaper, &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, a position he held until 1972. In that year, he was elected as a senator, going on to serve as minister of the environment and then minister of education. Then in 1979, he was appointed secretary of the small but powerful Italian Republican Party (PRI).

As a journalist, he sometimes used the pseudonym Giovanni dalle Bande Nere (Giovanni of the Black Bands).

==Prime Minister of Italy==

He served as Prime Minister of Italy from 1981 to 1982, the first PM since 1945 not to be a member of the Christian Democrats. He pledged to fight corruption (in particular a scandal involving certain Italian political figures connected with a Masonic lodge known as P2) and mounting terrorist violence.

In foreign policy, he was a non-interventionist but also moderately Americanist. In particular, he shifted away from Italy&#x27;s previous pro-Arab policy, refusing to meet Yasser Arafat during his official visit to Italy to protest the murder of Stefano Gaj Taché, an Italian Jewish child, by PLO terrorists, and suggesting that the Bologna train station bombing may have been perpetrated by the PLO and Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya, in spite of a majority accusing neo-fascists.

In 1982, after a political crisis between the Minister of the Treasury Beniamino Andreatta (DC) and the Minister of Finance Rino Formica (PSI), Spadolini resigned and formed a new cabinet identical to the former, which collapsed in November when Bettino Craxi&#x27;s Socialist Party withdrew its support.

==Later life==
Under his leadership, the PRI obtained 5% of all votes for the first time in the 1983 Italian general election. From 1987 to April 1994, he was president of the Italian Senate. He became Acting President of Italy on 28 April 1992, upon the resignation of then President Francesco Cossiga, for a month. Following the electoral success of Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s Forza Italia, he lost the chairmanship of the Senate to Carlo Scognamiglio Pasini by a single vote.

==Personal life and death==
Spadolini never married. In July 1994 he had a stomach operation. He died of respiratory failure in Rome in August 1994.
