<text>The Nolans were an Anglo-Irish girl group who formed in Blackpool in 1974 as the Nolan Sisters, before changing their name in 1980. From 1979 to 1982, the group had a run of hits, including &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Dancing&quot;, &quot;Gotta Pull Myself Together&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Rock You&quot;, &quot;Attention to Me&quot; and &quot;Chemistry&quot;. They are one of the world&#x27;s biggest selling girl groups. They were particularly successful in Japan, becoming the first European act to win the Tokyo Music Festival with &quot;Sexy Music&quot; in 1981, and won a Japan Record Award (Tokubetsu Kikaku Shō) in 1991.

The group disbanded in 2005, re-forming in 2009 with only 4 of the original members. A &quot;farewell tour&quot; was planned for 2013 but was cancelled following the death of one member. A reality television show with the group was later launched, but no further albums or tours were announced, and a second member died in 2025.

==History==
===1962–1974: Early career===
Tommy (26 September 1925 – 1998) and Maureen Nolan (15 December 1926 – 30 December 2007) met at Clerys Ballroom in Dublin and raised their family in Raheny. Tommy had a radio show on RTÉ. Due to the lack of work the young family moved from Dublin to Blackpool in 1962, and launched a family singing group, the Singing Nolans, in 1963. The original line-up comprised the parents, and seven of their eight children: sons Tommy (born 20 July 1949) and Brian (born 19 June 1955), and daughters Anne (born 12 November 1950), Denise (born 6 April 1952), Maureen (born 14 June 1954), Linda (23 February 1959 – 15 January 2025), and Bernadette (&#x27;Bernie&#x27;, 17 October 1960 – 4 July 2013). The youngest member, Coleen (born 12 March 1965), did not formally join the group until 1980 as she was too young to perform with her sisters.

The family performed even as the five girls went to school at Blackpool&#x27;s St Mary&#x27;s Catholic College. The Nolans also attended The Cardinal Wiseman School in Greenford, West London.

The Singing Nolans recorded an album, &quot;The Singing Nolans&quot;, a single &quot;Blackpool&quot; – which was a song about their local football club, Blackpool F.C., and is still used on match days at Bloomfield Road – and the EP &quot;Silent Night&quot; for the Nevis label in 1972.

Tommy Nolan Sr. died of liver cancer in 1998. His widow, Maureen, died in Blackpool on 30 December 2007, aged 81, after suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Anne Nolan released her autobiography, titled &quot;Anne&#x27;s Song&quot;, on 27 March 2008. In the book, co-written with Richard Barber, Anne said she had been repeatedly sexually abused by her father, from the age of 11 until she was 15 or 16.

===1973–1978: The Nolan Sisters===
In 1973, the Singing Nolans were booked to sing in Blackpool&#x27;s Cliffs Hotel on Christmas Day. After their performance, their father Tommy Nolan was at the bar when businessman Joe Lewis told Tommy that he was very interested for Tommy&#x27;s daughters to move to London to sing in Lewis&#x27;s club above the New London Theatre. In early 1974, the Nolan clan moved to London to work in the London Rooms on Drury Lane, where the girls changed their name from the Singing Nolans to the Nolan Sisters. They made their television debut on Cliff Richard&#x27;s TV show, singing &quot;Now I&#x27;m Stuck on You&quot; and were the resident guests for the entire run of series 4 of &quot;It&#x27;s Cliff Richard&quot; on BBC1. The line-up included Coleen, who sang lead on their debut single &quot;But I Do&quot; released on EMI records in 1974 (EMI 2209).

Following the 1974 single on EMI, they released several more non-charting singles on Target Records from 1975 to 1977, several of which were composed by Roger Greenaway. A 1977 eponymous album on the Hanover Grand label was sold only at the London Club Room in Drury Lane and is ranked by price guides as the most collectible UK release by the group.

During this period the Nolan Sisters appeared as the musical act for series six of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;.

===1978–1984: Chart success===
Their chart breakthrough came in 1978 with the covers album &quot;20 Giant Hits&quot; on Target, which reached No.3 in the UK. That year, they also supported Engelbert Humperdinck on a US tour, and Denise left the group to pursue a solo career.

In 1979, the group participated in the UK Eurovision selection contest &quot;&quot;. Their track &quot;Harry My Honolulu Lover&quot; had been written by former Eurovision contestant Terry Bradford who had finished 11th in the 1978 contest as part of the group Co-Co with their song &quot;Bad Old Days&quot;. The track was considered the favourite before the contest, but ultimately placed fourth, with Black Lace going on to represent the UK with their song &quot;Mary Ann&quot;. A lightning strike by BBC technicians minutes before the broadcast led to the cancellation of the show. In order to find a winner nonetheless, the regional juries had to make their decisions based on audio tapes of the songs from the show&#x27;s rehearsals. The group had been booked to promote the song on many BBC shows, leading to speculation that it had been taken for granted they would win the competition. One booking was representing the BBC at the 25th Anniversary celebrations for the Eurovision network, which was staged in Montreux, Switzerland, in May 1979.

After signing with CBS subsidiary Epic Records in 1979, the group enjoyed their greatest period of commercial success. Although their debut release – the failed UK Eurovision entry &quot;Harry, My Honolulu Lover&quot; – did not chart, their second Epic single &quot;Spirit, Body and Soul&quot; released in September, reached number 34 on the UK singles chart. In December 1979, the group released the disco-flavoured single &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Dancing&quot;, which became their best-known tune and biggest hit. It reached number 3 in the UK, number 2 in their native Ireland and number 1 in Japan, a rare event for a Western act; the single eventually sold more than 600,000 copies in Japan. The song, like the majority of the Nolans&#x27; hit singles, was written by Ben Findon, Mike Myers and Robert Puzey.

The self-titled album &quot;Nolan Sisters&quot;, which featured the first two charting Epic singles, eventually reached number 15 in the UK. Although still not an official member of the group, the youngest member of the family, Coleen, appeared on the cover of the album and in the video for &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Dancing&quot;. In early 1980, the group changed its name from the Nolan Sisters to the Nolans. Coleen released one solo single on Target in 1978, a song about Prince Andrew&#x27;s status as a teen idol.

The group&#x27;s 1980 album &quot; Making Waves &quot; peaked at number 11 but had the longest UK album chart run of their career (33 weeks) Singles from the album included &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Waves&quot; released April 1980 (UK number 12, Ireland number 5); &quot;Gotta Pull Myself Together&quot; released September 1980 (UK number 9, Ireland number 8) and &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Rock You&quot; released November 1980 (co-written by Billy Ocean, UK number 12, Ireland number 14). It was around the time of the release of &quot;Gotta Pull Myself Together&quot; that the line-up changed. Following her marriage, Anne left the group and Coleen became an official member (Anne appears on the UK single sleeve, while Coleen appears in the music video). &quot;Gotta Pull Myself Together&quot; also became the group&#x27;s first Australian hit, reaching number 3 in 1981; its parent album reached number 10 in Australia The last UK single release from &quot;Making Waves&quot; was &quot;Attention To Me&quot; released in March 1981 (UK number 9, Ireland number 5, Australia number 94).

&quot;Sexy Music&quot;, also featured on &quot;Making Waves&quot;, won the grand prize at the 1981 Tokyo Music Festival, and was subsequently released as a single in Japan. This became the group&#x27;s third number 1 on the Japanese Import chart – following &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Dancing&quot; and &quot;Gotta Pull Myself Together&quot;. During 1981, Coleen and Linda contributed vocals to the Young and Moody Band along with Motörhead frontman Lemmy, which scored a UK number 63 hit with &quot;Don&#x27;t Do That&quot;.

Another 1981 single &quot;Chemistry&quot; released in August (UK number 15, Ireland number 11, Australia number 51) was drawn from the album &quot;Portrait&quot;. This would become the group&#x27;s second Top 10 UK album, reaching number 7 in 1982 (Australia number 54), and was also the source of their final UK Top 20 single &quot;Don&#x27;t Love Me Too Hard&quot; released February 1982 (UK number 14, Ireland number 17). A third single from the album &quot;Crashing Down&quot; was released in May 1982. Anne rejoined the group in late 1982, making it a five-piece line up.

The 1982 compilation album &quot;Altogether&quot; reached UK number 52, but the accompanying single, &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, failed to chart. In 1983, their single, &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; was removed from the chart due to allegations of chart rigging. The group had released the single with a limited edition poster, exclusive to shops which registered chart sales. Later in the year, Linda left the group to pursue a solo career. At the time, she was nicknamed the &quot;Naughty Nolan&quot; due to risque publicity photos. The resulting four-woman line up of Bernie, Anne, Maureen and Coleen was stable until 1994.

The covers album &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!&quot; was released on Towerbell Records in 1984 and reached number 39. The Nolans also achieved success in Europe and New Zealand.

===1984–2005: New labels and line-ups===
In 1986, the Nolans released the LP &quot;Tenderly&quot;, which was an album of standards. They appeared in the second episode of the 1987 comedy series &quot;Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap&quot;, playing themselves in a blackmail plot and performing &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Dancing&quot;. A 1989 re-recording of the same song reached number 99, and another version reached number 51 in 1995.

In 1991, the group signed with Teichiku Records to record a series of albums covering popular Japanese songs in English. The first release was &quot;Playback Part 2&quot;, which covered songs made popular by Momoe Yamaguchi. &quot;Rock and Rolling Idol&quot; featured covers of Kyōko Koizumi songs. &quot;Tidal Wave (Samishii Nettaigyo)&quot; included the group&#x27;s versions of songs made famous by Wink, Seiko Matsuda, Akina Nakamori, Candies, and Yōko Oginome. &quot;The Hottest Place on Earth&quot; featured five covers of Princess Princess songs. The Nolans became the first Irish group to be awarded the 33rd Japan Record Awards Kikaku-shō (Prize for Planning) for their cover albums. Compilations of their Japanese material, often featuring remixes and some featuring other artists as well, were regularly released throughout the 1990s and 2000s in Japan, while several budget-priced compilations of their Epic-era material (sometimes re-recorded) appeared in the UK.

Coleen, who had married performer Shane Richie in 1990 and was now a mother of two, quit the group in 1994. In 1995, longstanding lead singer Bernie left to pursue an acting career. Anne and Maureen continued as a two-piece version of the Nolans. A re-recorded and remixed version of &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Dancing&quot;, released on the Living Beat label, reached number 51 in the UK in 1995, and Bernie and Coleen returned briefly to promote the single.

From 2000, the line-up consisted of Maureen and Anne, together with Anne&#x27;s daughter Amy and unrelated singer Julia Duckworth, and concentrated on live appearances, often at venues such as Butlins holiday camps and bingo halls. The group disbanded in 2005, with Maureen Nolan having been a member for 31 consecutive years.

Anne was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000, as was Linda in 2006. As part of her treatment, Linda had a breast removed. Bernie was diagnosed with breast cancer in April 2010 but successfully fought the disease until it later returned.

=== 2009–2014: Solo careers, reformation and death of Bernie Nolan ===
Most of the sisters have continued to work in show business, pursuing careers in acting, musical theatre, pantomime and touring. As an actress, Bernie had prominent TV roles in &quot;Brookside&quot; and &quot;The Bill&quot;, and toured in several stage shows, including the adaptation of the movie &quot;Flashdance&quot; in 2008. Coleen has mostly worked as a television presenter, hosting &quot;This Morning&quot; briefly in 2001 and appearing regularly as a panellist on &quot;Loose Women&quot; since 2000.

Four of the sisters – Bernie, Denise, Linda, and Maureen – have played the role of Mrs. Johnstone in the musical &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;. Both Maureen and Bernie have performed in productions of the comedy &quot;Mum&#x27;s the Word&quot;, and they toured together in the show in 2008.

Linda performed in the role of Maggie May at Blackpool&#x27;s Central Pier for 10 years, clocking up more than 1,000 performances and toured with &quot;Prisoner Cell Block H – The Musical&quot;. Denise released one solo single on Pye in 1979 and two on Mercury in 1982. She has frequently performed a Judy Garland tribute show.

The Nolans reunited as a five-piece (Anne, Bernie, Coleen, Linda and Maureen) for one-off performances of &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Dancing&quot; first for BBC One&#x27;s &quot;All Time Greatest Party Songs&quot;, hosted by Tess Daly, which aired on 17 December 2005 and again on 9 August 2007 on &quot;Loose Women&quot;, but dismissed any immediate prospect of a full-scale reunion.

The Nolans announced in June 2009 that they were reforming for a UK and Ireland tour. Four members – Coleen, Bernie, Linda and Maureen – undertook the tour, in October and November 2009. The two other sisters, Anne and Denise, were not involved.

Coleen said she had instigated the reformation after speaking to her manager. She explained: &quot;We&#x27;ve been approached before over the last four or five years but it has never felt like the right time and the right people being involved, and this time it was like &#x27;let&#x27;s just do it once more&quot;. The sisters performed their hits and several classic diva-type songs.

The reunion however sparked a split in the family as Anne has appeared in the press stating that she was excluded from the tour, and also issued a statement on her official website, which includes the comment: &quot;they are not my sisters anymore&quot;. Denise also issued a statement in support of Anne, claiming that the real reason for the reunion was due to some of the sisters being in financial difficulty. Bernie and Maureen later made amends with Anne and Denise, but Bernie stated there would not be a reconciliation with Coleen and Linda.

The Nolans released a new album, &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood Again&quot;, on 28 September 2009, which reached number 22 in the UK Albums Chart, their highest-charting album for 27 years. A live DVD was released on 9 November 2009. 2011 saw the release of an autobiography &quot;Survivors: Our Story&quot;.

In 2012, the eldest of the sisters, Anne, released her solo album, &quot;Just One Voice&quot;.

In September 2012, a farewell tour was announced, to take place from 15 February to 14 March 2013. The line-up would be the same as for the 2009 tour. On 28 October it was announced that the 2013 Farewell Tour had been postponed as a result of Bernie&#x27;s breast cancer resurgence. Early in 2013, the tour was cancelled completely. Bernie Nolan died from metastatic cancer on 4 July 2013, her cancer having spread to her brain, lungs, liver and bones. In 2014, Linda said that Bernie&#x27;s death had resulted in her making up with Anne and Denise. Also in 2014, Coleen stated that they had been asked to tour again, with Bernie appearing via holograms, but that it was still too soon.

=== 2020–2022: &quot;The Nolans Go Cruising&quot; and death of Linda Nolan ===
In February 2020, it was announced that the group would appear in a new TV series for Quest Red, &quot;The Nolans Go Cruising&quot;, a rival show to Channel 5&#x27;s award-winning &quot;Cruising with Jane McDonald&quot;. In the first series the band performed together for the first time in over 10 years. A second series was confirmed with the return of original member Denise Nolan, who would be performing with the band for the first time in over 40 years. In January 2025, Linda Nolan was admitted to Blackpool Victoria Hospital with double pneumonia. She fell into a coma, and died on the morning of 15 January, at the age of 65.

<text>Montes Archimedes is a mountain range on the Moon. It is named after the nearby crater Archimedes, which in turn is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes.

This group of mountains is located on a plateau in the eastern part of the Mare Imbrium, a lunar mare in the northwest quadrant of the Moon&#x27;s near side. They are bounded on the eastern side by the Palus Putredinis, a small mare, and to the north by Archimedes. Farther to the south and east lies the impressive Montes Apenninus, a long mountain range.

The selenographic coordinates of this range is 25.3° N, 4.6° W. The peaks of Montes Archimedes occupy an area with a maximum diameter of 163 km, although the most rugged portion of the terrain is concentrated within the central 70 km. The remainder of the peaks are scattered across the plateau, with no particular structure or pattern. Some of the peaks in this range achieve heights of up to 2.0 km, much less than those in the Montes Apenninus, for example, and none have received specific designations.

<doc id="1230618" wikidata="Q4683492" url="?curid=1230618" title="Administrative Template">
<text>Administrative Templates are a feature of Group Policy, a Microsoft technology for centralized management of machines and users in an Active Directory environment.

Administrative Templates facilitate the management of registry-based policy. An ADM file is used to describe both the user interface presented to the Group Policy administrator and the registry keys that should be updated on the target machines. An ADM file is a text file with a specific syntax which describes both the interface and the registry values which will be changed if the policy is enabled or disabled.

ADM files are consumed by the Group Policy Object Editor (GPEdit). Windows XP Service Pack 2 shipped with five ADM files (system.adm, inetres.adm, wmplayer.adm, conf.adm and wuau.adm). These are merged into a unified &quot;namespace&quot; in GPEdit and presented to the administrator under the Administrative Templates node (for both machine and user policy).

==Syntax==

A simple ADM example follows:

 CLASS MACHINE
 CATEGORY &quot;Wikipedia Apps&quot;
 POLICY &quot;Wikipedia&quot;
 KEYNAME &quot;Software\WikiSoft\Preferences&quot;
 EXPLAIN &quot;Configures WikiSoft Preferences&quot;
 VALUENAME &quot;SharingEnabled&quot;
 VALUEON &quot;Yes&quot;
 VALUEOFF &quot;No&quot;
 END POLICY
 END CATEGORY

A valid ADM file must have the following keywords:
* Class - either MACHINE or USER
* Category - Defines organizational structure of ADM and where it will be displayed in the GPEdit window.
* Policy - Groups definitions into one node and configuration screen of the GPEdit tree
Optional keywords used include:
* Keyname - used to define what registry key will be affected

View Filtering must be turned off in order to see custom preference settings (such as this example) in the Group Policy Editor.

==ADM files across different platforms==
It is important to note that ADM files shipped with Microsoft operating systems include descriptions of policy settings for not just that platform but for all other platforms on which Group Policy is supported. For example, the Windows XP Service Pack 2 ADM files described policy settings not just for this platform but also for Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003. This approach allows management of machines that are running an operating system other than that on which GPEdit is used.

==Managing ADM files==
By default, ADM files are stored in each GPO, within Sysvol on domain controllers. This creates a simple and effective model for replicating ADM files across domain controllers (which is handled by the File Replication Service). However, in some instances this can cause operational issues. To this end, various policy settings are available to manage the manner in which ADM files are read and stored. These are described in Microsoft&#x27;s KB article 816662.

==ADMX files==
Starting with Windows Vista, ADM files have mostly been replaced with ADMX files (and their associated language-specific ADML files). The ADMX file is structured in standard XML format, whereas the ADM files used a proprietary format.

<text>The St. Johns and Halifax Railway was a narrow gauge railroad incorporated on December 12, 1881, under the general incorporation laws of Florida. Its plan was to build a railroad from Rollestown in Putnam County on the St. Johns River, to a point on the Halifax River in Volusia County at or near New Britain (known as Ormond Beach today). The distance of the line was 51.99 miles, but 1.4 miles of the line was eventually abandoned. Florida state law chapter 3650, approved February 12, 1885, assigned it land grants.

On October 1, 1888, the property of the St. Johns and Halifax Railway was conveyed to the St. Johns &amp; Halifax River Railway, which was incorporated a few days later on October 11, 1888. At some point after this and before 1893, the narrow gauge line was converted to . On January 1, 1893, the line was acquired by the Florida East Coast Railway.

<text>St Paul&#x27;s Island (Maltese: &quot;Il-Gżejjer ta&#x27; San Pawl&quot;), also known as Selmunett, is a small island off Selmun, Mellieħa near the north of the island of Malta. St Paul&#x27;s Island is sometimes split into two islands by a shallow isthmus, and it is therefore sometimes referred to in the plural as St Paul&#x27;s Islands. St Paul&#x27;s Island has been uninhabited since World War II, and it is the second largest uninhabited island of Malta, having an area of .

==History==
The Acts of the Apostles tell the story of how Paul the Apostle was shipwrecked on an island which Chapter 28 identifies as Malta while on his way to Rome to face charges in 60 AD. Traditionally, St Paul&#x27;s Island was identified as the location for this shipwreck, but this has been disputed. Given the prevalent North Easterly winds and the sandbar and sandy beach mentioned in the Bible, it has been argued that it is more likely the actual shipwreck took place in the area known as il-Munxar which has a submerged reef and a sandy beach near St. Thomas&#x27; Bay in the southeast part of the island. Archaeologists have found the 4 anchors in St. Thomas Bay and documented the journey.

Until 1575, the islands were named after the Salomone family, who owned a nearby land in Mellieħa also called Selmun; the islands were named on maps as &quot;Isola Salomone&quot; and &quot;Isola Salomonetto&quot; and interpreted by the Maltese as &quot;Selmun&quot; and &quot;Selmunett&quot;. On other maps, the islands were referred to as &quot;Selmun&#x27;s Islands&quot; and &quot;The Scroll of Selmun&quot;. In 1576, Marco di Maria was being chased by Barbary corsairs off the coast of Malta. He navigated his vessel through the narrow channel between St Paul&#x27;s Island and Malta, but when the pirates followed him they ran aground and were captured. As a result of this, the Grandmaster Jean de la Cassière gave St Paul&#x27;s Islands to di Maria and the islands started to be called Tal-Barba Marku.

After the death of Marco, as decreed by the Grand Master, the island passed to his family. It first went to his son Giovanni de Maria and later to the nephew of Marco who was the son of Giavanni, who was named Narduccio de Maria. Narduccio lost his life in a battle at sea in a fight against the Ottomans. The island was then transferred to the Order of Saint John. Sometime after 1649 a tower was built on the island by Grand Master Giovanni Paolo Lascaris. The tower was part of a contract, for the exchange of the island with the Casa della Giornata (now the site of the Royal Opera House) in Valletta which belonged to Michel de Torellas, the Prior of Catalonia.

In 1844 a prominent statue of Saint Paul was erected on the island. It was sculpted by Segismondo Dimech from Valletta and Salvatore Dimech from Lija. The statue was officially inaugurated and blessed on 21 September 1845. It was restored by Din l-Art Ħelwa a number of times, first in 1996, then in 2007, in 2014, and 2015.
Until the 1930s, a farmer called Vincenzo Borg, nicknamed &quot;Ta&#x27; Bajdafin&quot;, lived on the island in the tower built by Grandmaster Lascaris. He converted it and used it as a farmhouse. Borg abandoned the dwelling, and the fields on the island, just before World War II started. The tower was a three-chambered structure with a heavily buttressed wall at its lower level. It was built similar to other Lascaris towers. Since it was abandoned, the upper room has collapsed and the structure is now in ruins.

Pope John Paul II visited the island by boat during his visit to Malta in 1990. In the same year, a statue named Kristu tal-Baħħara was sunk near St. Paul&#x27;s Island. After 10 years, the statue was moved from St. Paul&#x27;s Bay to Qawra point because of deteriorating visibility in the water and a decline in divers visiting the site.

==Geography==
Saint Paul&#x27;s Islands lie about 100 metres off the coast of Mellieħa, Malta. The island can split into two islands by a shallow isthmus according to the sea level, and when they are split the larger island on the west is known as &quot;Saint Paul&#x27;s Island&quot; while the smaller one on the east is known as &quot;Quartz Island&quot;. Both islands are made of upper coralline limestone.

Saint Paul&#x27;s Island&#x27;s landscape is a maritime garigue dominated by golden samphire, Maltese fleabane and other species. Quartz Island is more exposed and has less vegetation than the main island.

A population of the land snail &quot;Trochoidea spratti&quot; can be found on the islands. Wild rabbits used to live on the island but the population died off due to disease. A subspecies of the Maltese wall lizard known as &quot;Podarcis filfolensis kieselbachi&quot; also lived there but the population apparently became extinct in 2005.

<text>The Protectorate-General to Pacify the East () was an administrative division of the Chinese Tang dynasty in Manchuria and the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. It was established after the Tang dynasty defeated Goguryeo and annexed its territories. In the place of Baekje and Goguryeo, the Tang dynasty created the Protectorate General to Pacify the East and the Ungjin Commandery. A proposal to set up the Great Commandery of Gyerim by the Emperor Gaozong of Tang to King Munmu of Silla was refused.

== History ==
After the Tang dynasty conquered Goguryeo in 668, the Protectorate General to Pacify the East, otherwise known as the Andong Protectorate, was created in Pyongyang and supposedly stationed with 200,000 soldiers. The protectorate was divided into 9 commanderies, 42 prefectures, and 100 counties with an estimated 697,000 Goguryeo households.

In 669 the people of Goguryeo revolted in response to Tang governance. In response the Tang forcibly deported tens of thousands of households and resettled them in empty areas south of the Changjiang (Yangtze) and Huai River, each in contemporary China. The weak and poor were left behind and assigned to guard duty in service of the protectorate. Different numbers of households are given by various sources. According to the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; citing Chinese sources, the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; says 38,200 households, the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; and &quot;Tongdian&quot; say 28,200, and the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; says 30,000. The &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; says 38,300. Mark Cartwright gives a number of 200,000 people forcefully resettled including the king. Wang Zhenping gives a figure of 78,000 households.

From 670 to 675, Goguryeo loyalists aligned with Silla launched offensives against the Tang Chinese on all fronts within and outside the Protectorate. Aided by Silla, Goguryeo generals such as Go Yeonmu and Geom Mojam reclaimed parts of former Goguryeo territories after winning several decisive battles in Ogol, Gaedonyang, and Paeseo. For instance, Go Yeonmu, led a counter-offensive against the Tang armies in Liaodong alongside the Sillan general Seol Oyu in 670, defeating the Tang armies stationed in the area and occupying it briefly until 674. Originally Emperor Taizong of Tang promised to exchange Baekje and the lands south of Pyongyang in return for Silla&#x27;s military cooperation. However Taizong died before the conquest of Goguryeo was completed, and his successor Gaozong reneged on the promise.

In 671, Sillan forces drove out the Tang. In 675 the Tang attacked Silla and defeated them in Gyeonggi. In response Munmu of Silla dispatched a tributary mission to Tang with apologies. Gaozong accepted Munmu&#x27;s apologies and withdrew Tang troops to deal with the Tibetan threat in the west. Seeing the Tang&#x27;s strategic weakness, Silla renewed the advance on Tang territory. Silla took all the territory south of the Taedong River in a series of battles in 676.

By 676 the Tang were forced to relocate the protectorate seat to the more easily defendable city of Liaoyang.

In 677 the seat was moved to Xincheng, in modern Fushun, Liaoning.

The deposed Bojang of Goguryeo was designated &quot;Liaodong Commander King of Joseon&quot; () in 667. Upon arriving in Liaodong, he plotted with the Mohe people to revive Goguryeo. News of his intentions reached the Tang, and Bojang was banished to southwestern China in 681. 

In 714, the seat was moved to Pingzhou, in modern Lulong County, Qinhuangdao, Hebei.

In 736, the Tang formally recognized Silla&#x27;s control of Korea south of the Taedong River. In 743, the seat was moved to the Old City of Liaoxi, possibly Ying Prefecture (modern Chaoyang, Liaoning).

The Protectorate General to Pacify the East, otherwise known as the Andong Protectorate, was abandoned in 756 or ended in 761.

<text>Gavin A. Schmidt is a British climatologist, climate modeler and Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York, and co-founder of the climate science blog RealClimate.

==Work==
He was educated at The Corsham School, earned a BA (Hons) in mathematics at Jesus College, Oxford, and a PhD in applied mathematics at University College London. Schmidt worked on the variability of the ocean circulation and climate, using general circulation models (GCMs). He has also worked on ways to reconcile paleo-data with models. He helped develop the GISS ocean and coupled GCMs to improve the representation of the present day climate, while investigating their response to climate forcing.

As of 2024, Schmidt heads NASA&#x27;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He was named for the director position in June 2014 as its then deputy director, becoming to the third person to hold this post, which had been vacant after the retirement of James E. Hansen. In an interview with Science News, Schmidt said that he wanted to continue the institute&#x27;s work on climate modeling and to expand its work on climate impacts and astrobiology.

===Research===
His main research interest is climate variability, both its internal and the response to climate forcing, investigated via ocean-atmosphere general circulation models. He also uses these to study palaeoclimate by working on methods to compare palaeo-data with model output. Schmidt helps to develop the GISS ocean and coupled GCMs (ModelE). This model has been &quot;isotopically enabled&quot; to carry oxygen-18 tracers, allowing the model to simulate the pattern of δ18O observed in ice cores, cave records and ocean sediments.

== Media and outreach ==
Schmidt has appeared on various occasions in the media, often he is asked about his expertise on climate related study findings, current events or gives lectures. Schmidt worked with the American Museum of Natural History, the College de France, and the New York Academy of Sciences for education and outreach. Schmidt and eight other colleagues founded in 2004 the RealClimate blog. The blog provides critical commentary on climate science with the scope on outreach to the public and for journalists. Additionally, the blog features frequent guest posts by experts in their field. Articles and commentary have defended scientific research against allegations made about the hockey stick graph. During the 2009-2010 Climatic Research Unit email controversy, he strongly defended the scientists involved, including Michael E. Mann and Phil Jones. Journalist Fred Pearce noted, &quot;&quot;Schmidt wrote that the emails merely showed how scientists interact in private&quot;, and that &quot;Gravity isn&#x27;t a useful theory because Newton was a nice man.&quot;&quot;

Schmidt was &quot;EarthSky Science Communicator of the Year&quot; in 2011.

==Awards==
In 2011, the American Geophysical Union awarded Schmidt the inaugural &quot;Climate Communications Prize&quot;, for his work on communicating climate-change issues to the public. The award news release noted his outreach work including co-founding and contributing to the RealClimate blog. He was a contributing author of the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); the work of the IPCC, including the contributions of many scientists, was recognised by the joint award of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. Schmidt was named as one of Scientific American&#x27;s &quot;Top 50 Research Leaders&quot; of the year 2004.

==Publications==
Schmidt has published over 100 studies in peer-reviewed journals such as &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot;, &quot;Science&quot;, and &quot;Nature&quot;, on various climate related topics.

He is the co-author, with Joshua Wolfe, of &quot;Climate Change: Picturing the Science&quot; (2009), which has a foreword by Jeffrey D. Sachs. The book combines images of the effects of climate change with scientific explanations.

His Erdős number is four.

<text>Alexander Outlaw Anderson (November 10, 1794May 23, 1869) was an American slave owner and attorney who represented Tennessee in the United States Senate, and later served in the California State Senate, and on the California Supreme Court.

==Early life==
The son of Patience Outlaw and longtime U.S. Senator Joseph Anderson, he was born at his father&#x27;s home, &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Rest&quot; in Jefferson County (now Hamblen County), Tennessee. He was named for his maternal grandfather, frontiersman Alexander Outlaw (1738–1826).

As a youth he graduated from Washington College near Greeneville, Tennessee. He volunteered for service in the War of 1812 and fought under Andrew Jackson in the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. Later that year he was admitted to the bar and began a practice in Dandridge, Tennessee. In 1821, Jackson was appointed Territorial Governor of Florida, and Anderson the United States district attorney of West Florida.

Afterward, he moved to Knoxville, and then served as the superintendent of the United States United States General Land Office in Alabama in 1836. He was an agent in the Indian removals of 1838 for Alabama and Florida, and held a contract through 1848.

==Senate and legal career==
In February 1840, Anderson was elected to the United States Senate by the Tennessee General Assembly to the vacancy caused by the resignation of Senator Hugh Lawson White. He was a member of the Whig party whose resignation was orchestrated by Governor James K. Polk so that a Democratic senator could be appointed. Anderson served in that body from February 26, 1840, to March 3, 1841, when the term expired. In May 1840, he was a delegate to the national Democratic Party convention in Baltimore, Maryland. Anderson did not stand for reelection to the seat; it was to remain vacant for a period when a group of Tennessee Democratic legislators called the &quot;Immortal Thirteen&quot; refused to meet and give a quorum sufficient to allow the election of a successor, apparently preferring no representation to that by a member of the other party, the Whigs.

After leaving the Senate, Anderson remained active in politics. In September 1844, he published a series of letters on the admission of Texas as a new state, which were published as a book. In July 1847, he announced his support for Zachary Taylor of Louisiana as a candidate for President of the United States.

Anderson was a leader of an overland company of leaving from Independence, Missouri, and going to California in 1849. He served in the California State Senate in 1852 as a Democrat. In February 1852, his name was put forward for U.S. Senator, but he lost the Democratic Party nomination. He then was appointed by Governor John Bigler as an associate justice of the California Supreme Court, serving from April 6, 1852, to January 2, 1853, before returning to Tennessee in 1853 or 1854. While in the California Supreme Court, he co-authored a ruling supporting the Fugitive Slave Act, writing, &quot;Slaves are not parties to the Constitution, and although ‘persons,’ they are property.&quot;

Anderson later practiced law in Washington, D.C., appearing before both the Court of Claims and the Supreme Court of the United States. During the American Civil War he returned to Alabama, practicing law in Mobile and Camden. Again returning to Tennessee, he died in Knoxville on May 23, 1869, and is buried in the Old Gray Cemetery.

==Personal life==
In 1821, he married Maria Hamilton in Washington, D.C., who died in 1825 in Jonesboro, Tennessee. On June 7, 1825, he remarried married to Eliza Rosa Deaderick, his cousin, and they had 11 children. She died October 15, 1866, in Knoxville, Tennessee.

<text>The European Shield (known as the Parker Pen Shield for sponsorship reasons) was a repechage tournament for teams knocked out in the first round of the European Challenge Cup. As such, it formed Europe&#x27;s third-tier club rugby union competition below the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup. The name &quot;European Shield&quot; had previously been used for the now renamed European Challenge Cup.

A total of 16 teams participated in each season. The competition was contested between the first round losers from the European Challenge Cup with teams being added directly to make up the full 16 team complement. The structure of the competition was a purely knockout format; teams played each other on a home and away basis, with the aggregate points winner proceeding to the next round. The final was a single leg.

The competition had a brief existence, running for just three seasons in 2002–03, 2003–04 and 2004–05. Three clubs won the competition in each year that it was run and there were three different runners up. Thereafter, the European Challenge Cup reverted to its previous &quot;pool and knockout&quot; format and the European Shield was discontinued.

<doc id="1230640" wikidata="Q17001796" url="?curid=1230640" title="Common Worship">
<text>Common Worship is the name given to the series of services authorised by the General Synod of the Church of England and launched on the first Sunday of Advent in 2000. It represents the most recent stage of development of the Liturgical Movement within the Church and is the successor to the Alternative Service Book (ASB) of 1980. Like the ASB, it is an alternative to the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer (BCP)&quot;, which remains officially the normative liturgy of the Church of England.

It has been published as a series of books, rather than a single volume, offering a wider choice of forms of worship than any of its predecessors. It was drafted by the Church of England&#x27;s Liturgical Commission; the material was then either authorised by General Synod (sometimes with amendments) or simply commended for use by the House of Bishops.

==Series==
The main &quot;Common Worship&quot; book is called Common Worship: Services and Prayers for the Church of England. It was published in 2000 alongside Common Worship: President&#x27;s Edition. These volumes contain the material for Sunday services, but unlike the ASB, contain no readings.

The third book to be published (also in 2000), Common Worship: Pastoral Services, provides for the first time a range of healing services, as well as revised provision for weddings and funerals. The former has a completely rewritten preface that no longer describes the threefold purposes of marriage and is much more secular in tone. It includes, for the first time, a congregational response to the declarations by the couple and a long nuptial blessing. The funeral provisions includes material for before and after the service, all completely rewritten. The funeral now includes an optional penitential section, no longer has a required psalm and includes set intercessions. It also allows for a eulogy by one of the mourners, a new departure, at the beginning of the service.

In 2005 the fourth book, Common Worship: Daily Prayer, was published. The form and style of daily morning and evening prayer no longer shows the influence of the &quot;BCP,&quot; but the work of the English Franciscan community and its book &quot;Celebrating Common Prayer&quot;. The offices are not dissimilar to those of the Roman Catholic Church. Penitence becomes optional, as does the Creed; the &quot;Te Deum&quot; disappears almost completely, and a Gospel canticle—the &quot;Benedictus&quot; in the morning and the &quot;Magnificat&quot; in the evening—follows the reading(s); there is a wide range of intercessions; collects are provided for lesser festivals (unlike in the main book); and there is a psalter. Both the book and the new daily lectionary were tried out in parishes before final publication.

In 2006, three more volumes, Common Worship: Christian Initiation, Common Worship: Ordination Services and Common Worship: Times and Seasons, were published. In the first, there is provision for Baptism, Confirmation, and related rites (including Reconciliation). In the second, there are rites for the ordination of deacons, priests and bishops. In the third, there is provision for all the seasons of the church&#x27;s year, including sections on the Agricultural Year and Embertide.

The final book, Common Worship: Festivals, was published in 2008 and provides propers for all the Festivals and Lesser Festivals of the Church of England&#x27;s calendar.

==Content and style==
&quot;Common Worship&quot; is published in electronic, as well as paper form, with the intent that congregations can assemble their own orders of service and extend them with prayers and readings.

==Appraisal==
&quot;Common Worship&quot; and other liturgical revision efforts in the Church of England have been criticized by proponents of the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. In 2004, Prayer Book Society president Patrick Cormack described the preceding 40 years of Church of England revisions as &quot;liturgical anarchy&quot;, holding that the new liturgical books had alienated traditionalists and failed to attract young people. Cormack added that &quot;command of modern liturgists over the language does not begin to equal Cranmer&#x27;s&quot;.

<doc id="1230652" wikidata="Q2296700" url="?curid=1230652" title="Mai, the Psychic Girl">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written by and illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami. It was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from March 1985 to April 1986, with its chapters collected in six volumes; it was later republished by Media Factory. 

&quot;Mai, the Psychic Girl&quot; was one of the first manga series to be fully published in English; it was published by Viz Communications, in partnership with Eclipse Comics, in a bi-weekly comic book format starting in 1987 and republished in collected volumes a few years later.

==Story==
The story follows , a 14-year-old girl with powerful psychic abilities. She is being pursued by the Wisdom Alliance, an organization which secretly strives to control the world. The alliance already controls four other powerful psychic children, and it has hired the Kaieda Intelligence Agency to capture Mai.

==Media==
===Manga===
Written by and illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami, &quot;Mai, the Psychic Girl&quot; was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from March 20, 1985, to April 2, 1986. Shogakukan collected its chapters in six volumes, released from August 1985 to August 1986. Media Factory republished the series in three volumes, released from 2002 to 2003, and in two volumes in 2006.

&quot;Mai, the Psychic Girl&quot; was one of the first manga series to be fully published in English. Along with &quot;The Legend of Kamui&quot; and &quot;Area 88&quot;, &quot;Mai, the Psychic Girl&quot; was one of the first three manga published by Viz Communications, in partnership with Eclipse Comics. It was published in a bi-weekly comic book format starting in May 1987. As it was one of the forerunners of manga popularity in the West, &quot;Mai&quot; was chosen for localization due to its middle-ground artwork: neither &quot;too Japanese or too American.&quot; It was presented in the &quot;flopped&quot; format; panels and pages read in the left-to-right reading order instead of the Japanese style of right-to-left, that was the norm with early localized manga. Along with the other two series, &quot;Mai&quot; proved popular enough that second printings were needed of the first two issues. The series was later reprinted in a 4-volume edition by Titan Books in 1989, and by Viz in 1990; the edition featured a brief nude scene that had been edited out of the comic book edition. The series was later re-released in 3-volume edition, titled &quot;Mai, the Psychic Girl: Perfect Collection&quot;.

===Film===
Beginning in the late 1980s, Ron Mael and Russell Mael of the band Sparks attempted to make &quot;Mai, the Psychic Girl&quot; into a musical, with interest from Tim Burton and Carolco Pictures, who purchased the film rights in August 1991. Carolco hoped Burton would start production in 1992, but he chose to work on &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; and &quot;Ed Wood&quot; for Disney. The option on the film rights eventually expired, and Burton dropped out. Francis Ford Coppola later developed the property in the 1990s. In June 2000, Sony Pictures Entertainment started on a new different project with Kirk Wong attached to direct. By February 2001, a script had been written by Lisa Addario and Joey Syracuse for Sony&#x27;s Columbia Pictures. The release of &quot;The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman&quot;, a radio musical by Sparks, in August 2009, was informed by the six years the band spent trying to get their &quot;Mai, the Psychic Girl&quot; produced. The album generated new interest, and gained a &quot;second wind&quot;, Russell Mael explained. &quot;The music is all ready and we are hoping that this still might see the light of day&quot;. In 2010, Burton expressed renewed interest in adapting the property.

==Reception==
&quot;Mai, the Psychic Girl&quot; was well received by critics and readers in America (more than in its native Japan), and is recognized as an important first step in the gradual popularity of manga in America. Many praised the series for avoiding typical superhero cliches and for also introducing many readers to the world of manga.

<text>The synthesis of [[precious metals]] involves the use of either nuclear reactors or particle accelerators to produce these elements.

==Precious metals occurring as fission products==

Ruthenium and rhodium are precious metals produced as a small percentage of the fission products from the nuclear fission of uranium. The longest half-lives of the radioisotopes of these elements generated by nuclear fission are 373.59 days for ruthenium and 45 days for rhodium. This makes the extraction of the non-radioactive isotope from spent nuclear fuel possible after a few years of storage, although the extract must be checked for radioactivity from trace quantities of other elements before use.

=== Ruthenium ===

Each kilogram of the fission products of 235U will contain 63.44 grams of ruthenium isotopes with halflives longer than a day. Since a typical used nuclear fuel contains about 3% fission products, one ton of used fuel will contain about 1.9 kg of ruthenium. The 103Ru and 106Ru will render the fission ruthenium very radioactive. If the fission occurs in an instant then the ruthenium thus formed will have an activity due to 103Ru of and 106Ru of . 103Ru has a half-life of about 39 days meaning that within 390 days it will have effectively decayed to the only stable isotope of rhodium, 103Rh, well before any reprocessing is likely to occur. 106Ru has a half-life of about 373 days, meaning that if the fuel is left to cool for 5 years before reprocessing only about 3% of the original quantity will remain; the rest will have decayed. For comparison, the activity in natural potassium (due to naturally occurring ) is about 30 Bq per gram.

=== Rhodium ===

It is possible to extract rhodium from used nuclear fuel: 1 kg of fission products of 235U contains 13.3 grams of 103Rh. At 3% fission products by weight, one ton of used fuel will contain about 400 grams of rhodium. The longest lived radioisotope of rhodium is 102mRh with a half-life of 2.9 years, while the ground state (102Rh) has a half-life of 207 days.

Each kilogram of fission rhodium will contain 6.62 ng of 102Rh and 3.68 ng of 102mRh. As 102Rh decays by beta decay to either 102Ru (80%) (some positron emission will occur) or 102Pd (20%) (some gamma ray photons with about 500 keV are generated) and the excited state decays by beta decay (electron capture) to 102Ru (some gamma ray photons with about 1 MeV are generated). If the fission occurs in an instant then 13.3 grams of rhodium will contain 67.1 MBq (1.81 mCi) of 102Rh and 10.8 MBq (291 μCi) of 102mRh. As it is normal to allow used nuclear fuel to stand for about five years before reprocessing, much of this activity will decay away leaving 4.7 MBq of 102Rh and 5.0 MBq of 102mRh. If the rhodium metal was then left for 20 years after fission, the 13.3 grams of rhodium metal would contain 1.3 kBq of 102Rh and 500 kBq of 102mRh. Rhodium has the highest price of these precious metals ($440,000/kg in 2022), but the cost of the separation of the rhodium from the other metals needs to be considered, although recent high prices may create opportunity for consideration.

==Precious metals produced via irradiation==

===Gold===
Chrysopoeia, the artificial production of gold, is the traditional goal of alchemy. Such transmutation is possible in particle accelerators or nuclear reactors, although the production cost is estimated to be a trillion times the market price of gold. Since there is only one stable gold isotope, 197Au, nuclear reactions must create this isotope in order to produce usable gold.

Gold was synthesized from mercury by neutron bombardment in 1941, but the isotopes of gold produced were all radioactive. In 1924, a German scientist, Adolf Miethe, reported achieving the same feat, but after various replication attempts around the world, it was deemed an experimental error.

In 1980, Glenn Seaborg transmuted several thousand atoms of bismuth into gold at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. His experimental technique was able to remove protons and neutrons from the bismuth atoms. Seaborg&#x27;s technique was far too expensive to enable the routine manufacture of gold but his work is the closest yet to emulating an aspect of the mythical Philosopher&#x27;s stone.

<doc id="1230663" wikidata="Q320436" url="?curid=1230663" title="Jemmy Button">
<text>Orundellico, known as &quot;Jeremy Button&quot; or &quot;Jemmy Button&quot; or &quot;Jimmy Button&quot; (c. 1815–1864), was a member of the Yaghan (or Yámana) people from islands around Tierra del Fuego in modern Chile and Argentina. He was taken to England by Captain FitzRoy in HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; and became a celebrity there for a period.

==HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;==
In 1830, Captain Robert FitzRoy, at the command of the first expedition of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;, took a group of hostages from the Fuegian people after one of his ship&#x27;s whaleboats was stolen. Jemmy Button was paid for with a mother of pearl button, hence his name. It is not clear whether his family willingly accepted the sale or he was simply abducted. FitzRoy decided to take four of the young Fuegian hostages all the way to England &quot;to become useful as interpreters, and be the means of establishing a friendly disposition towards Englishmen on the part of their countrymen.&quot; He seems to have shown great concern for the four, feeding them before his own officers and crew and intending them to be educated and Christianised so that they could improve the conditions of their kin.

The names given to the Fuegians by the crew were York Minster, Jemmy Button, Fuegia Basket (a girl) and Boat Memory. The original names of the first three were, respectively, El&#x27;leparu, O&#x27;run-del&#x27;lico, and Yok&#x27;cushly. Boat Memory died of smallpox shortly after his arrival in England and his Yaghan name is unknown.

==Arrival in England==
The &quot;Beagle&quot; arrived back in Plymouth from her first voyage of exploration in mid-October 1830. The newspapers soon started publishing details of the Yaghan visitors and they became celebrities. In London, they met King William IV. Fuegia Basket was given a bonnet by Queen Adelaide .

==Return to Patagonia==
One year later, Captain Fitzroy returned the three surviving Fuegians home. He took with him a young naturalist, Charles Darwin, on what was the second voyage of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;.

After initial difficulty recalling his language and customs, Orundellico / Jemmy soon shed his European clothes and habits. A few months after his arrival, he was seen emaciated, naked save for a loincloth, and long-haired. Nevertheless, he declined the offer to return to England, which Darwin conjectured was due to the presence of his &quot;young and nice looking wife&quot;. It appears that he and the others had taught their families some English.

Darwin noted in his &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; that Jemmy Button, probably like other Fuegians, did not have any concept of God or Devil. In &quot;The Descent of Man,&quot; he suggests that Button never understood the plan to convert Fuegians to Christianity and &quot;with justifiable pride, stoutly maintained that there was no devil in his land.&quot;

==Wulaia Bay massacre==
In 1855, a group of Christian missionaries from the Patagonian Missionary Society visited Wulaia Bay on Navarino Island to find that Jemmy still had a remarkable grasp of English. Some time later in 1859, another group of missionaries was killed at Wulaia Bay by the Yaghan, supposedly led by Jemmy and his family. In early 1860, Jemmy visited Keppel Island and gave evidence at the enquiry held in Stanley into the massacre. He denied responsibility.

==Death==
In 1863, the missionary Waite Stirling visited Tierra del Fuego and re-established contact with Jemmy; from then relations with the Yaghan improved. In 1866, after Jemmy&#x27;s death, Stirling took one of Jemmy&#x27;s sons, known as Threeboy, to England.

<text>The Sauer 202 is a lightweight bolt-action rifle manufactured by Sauer &amp; Sohn in Germany between 1993 and 2015. The rifle was imported to the US by SIG Arms. This rifle has a modular construction which allowed easy replacement of components and caliber changes. This rifle has a modular barrel-change system allows to change between calibers easily, and was offered in a large selection of calibers.

Separate magnum receivers and barrels were made which were not interchangeable with non-magnum calibers.

== Receiver ==
The standard receiver is made out of steel, but there is also a lightweight version available made of aluminium which weighs 470 grams less.

== Barrel change system ==
The standard 202 system uses the same receiver for mini and short action cartridges, but different types of bolts. The bolts for mini length cartridges (like .223) uses three lugs, while most short action cartridges (i.e. .308) uses six lug bolts. The four main types of bolts and some of their factory calibers are:

;Mini action cartridges, using a 3 lug bolt:
* .222 Remington and .223 Remington (both 9.6 mm rim)

;Some short action cartridges, using a 3 lug bolt:
* .22-250 Remington and .243 Winchester (both 12 mm rim)

;Some short and medium action cartridges, using a 6 lug bolt:
* 6.5x55 (12.2 mm rim)
* .25-06 Remington, .270 Winchester, .308 Winchester, .30-06 Springfield (all 12 mm rim)
* 7x64mm Brenneke and 8x57mm IS (both 11.95 mm rim)
* 9.3x62mm (11.93 mm rim)

;Magnum calibers, using a 6 lug bolt:
* 7mm Remington Magnum and .300 Winchester Magnum (both 13.5 mm rim)

The magnum version uses a different receiver than the standard version, and some parts can not normally be interchanged between standard and magnum caliber versions. For example, the barrel tenon on the magnum receiver is larger, meaning that barrels can not be swapped between the standard and magnum receivers.

The barrel can be changed using a 5 mm hex key.

<doc id="1230669" wikidata="Q3567648" url="?curid=1230669" title="Whatfor">
<text>Whatfor is the name of the band created by the second season of the popular French reality-TV show &quot;Popstars&quot; aired on RTL Group TV channel &quot;M6&quot; in fall 2002. The group consisted of Cyril and Erika (from Marseille), Nicolas (from Toulon) and Monia (from the Lyon suburbs).

Their first hit &quot;Plus haut&quot; (Higher) reached rank #1 in the French charts and so did their first and only album. Their musical style was a mix of modern dance music, pop, and R&amp;B, with a clear late 1970s disco/funk touch that is mainly because the mastermind behind this album, Philippe Saisse, was the one behind the most successful albums of some great artists of that era like Chic and Chaka Khan.

But the success story ended as their second single called &quot;L&#x27;amour n&#x27;a pas de loi!&quot; (&quot;Love knows no law!&quot;), a cover of Swedish singer Carola&#x27;s song &quot;A Kiss Goodbye&quot; (from her album &quot;My Show&quot;) was a flop.

The group disbanded in 2003. Erika and Cyril founded a band together (Everton), and Nicolas tried a solo career, but none of their attempts were successful. However, Nicolas went back to being a comedian which garnered him some fame.

<doc id="1230670" wikidata="Q2578642" url="?curid=1230670" title="Purley on Thames">
<text>Purley on Thames (known locally as Purley) is a village and civil parish in Berkshire, England. Purley is centred north-west of Reading, east of Pangbourne, and south-east of Oxford. Historically, Purley comprised three separate manors and associated settlements. In the centre there is an historic area named variously Lething or Burley (Domesday) which accommodated traders and craftsmen alongside the main Reading to Oxford road.

==History==

Purley has been settled since at least Saxon times. The original settlements were based on Purley Magna (to the east), Purley Parva (to the north-west) and Purley La Hyde (to the west). Ownership of these manors changed several times over successive centuries but the parish remained almost entirely agricultural until development began in the 20th century, with a population of 150–200. Since then it has grown to 4,232 (2001 census) and around 4394 people in 2011.

A timbered Elizabethan manor house was constructed in the 1540s, to be replaced by a brick house in 1740. This was demolished around 1800 to be replaced by Purley Park, designed by James Wyatt in 1800 and on the brow of the hill to be well away from flooding. The house is a Grade II* listed building. At the same time most of the eastern part of the parish was emparked; a new road, New Hill, constructed to provide access to the residual village, and the turnpike highway diverted to the south.

In 1948, the mansion was purchased to provide a home and school for people with Down syndrome. While the mansion itself has now been converted to apartments, the Purley Park Trust continues to support adults with learning difficulties with care homes in the former grounds. When the mansion was built, the farm was moved further west and was home to the South Berks Hunt for many years. Its Master of Foxhounds, Cecil Aldin, ran a remount depot there in World War I, employing his friend and fellow artist, Alfred Munnings as a horse doctor. After World War II the property was sold to Messrs G Percy Trentham who used it as the head offices for their civil engineering business. This building is also Grade II* listed. In the 1990s this too was redeveloped and the barn, another listed building, which had originally been adjacent to the church, donated to the parish council as a community facility.

Purley Hall was built around 1608 to replace the manor house of Purley La Hyde and was home to personages such as Warren Hastings, Lady Baden-Powell, as a child, and Thomas Hawes, of South Sea Bubble fame.

Several smallholdings were established between World War I and World War II, including one by Mortimer Menpes, the artist and friend of Whistler. These have almost all now been redeveloped.

===Recent development===

Purley lost most of its old houses due to enclosures around 1800 and redevelopment in the 20th century. After the sale of the estate of Purley Magna in the 1920s most of the eastern part of the parish has been developed but there is easy access to rural areas to the west and south. The area encompassing the other manors has also retained a rural character.

Changes in the 20th century began with ribbon development along the Oxford Road and Long Lane and in recent years these properties have been redeveloped with modern housing estates. The Purley River Estate was sold off in small plots in the 1930s and for many years suffered much non-planned development. As a result of the guidance plan agreed during the 1960s, it has gradually developed from self built, timber dwellings and converted railway carriages, to an area with more conventional housing. The gradual upgrading of the area has resulted in a diverse range of housing styles.

==Government==
The civil parish of Purley on Thames stretches roughly 1.5 km both north–south and east–west and is within the West Berkshire Council unitary authority area. It has its own parish council of 13 elected members with the parish office at Goosecroft, off Beech Road. The parish is within the Reading West parliamentary constituency.

==Geography==

Previously a rural village, Purley is in West Berkshire. It is bounded to the north by a stretch of the River Thames, to the east by the Borough of Reading, to the west by Pangbourne and to the south by Tilehurst and Sulham. The eastern half is almost completely redeveloped but the western half includes meadow land alongside the river and agricultural land on the north slope of the escarpment. There are small settlements in the extreme west, around Sulham Home Farm, and in the north west around Springs and Westbury Farms.

Due to its proximity to the River Thames, Purley has suffered periods of severe flooding, most recently in 2014. The part of Purley closest to the river has changed radically, with most properties having been built since the 1970s and, with a very few exceptions, it was a condition of planning approval that the houses were built at or above the 1947 flood level. A flood alleviation scheme, in the form of a clay bund and a pumping platform was completed by the Environment Agency in late 2014.

==Demography==
The population has around 88% White British ethnicity, 4% other white ethnicity; residents identifying with an Asian ethnicity constituted 3%, with a Caribbean or African ethnicity 1% and those with a mixed ethnicity, 2%.
The majority of homes in Purley are detached houses, with minorities of small housing and shared ownership properties and several council estates. The area is largely unaffordable for most of the population – as of 2016, the average price of a property in Purley is £413,268 and the median UK wage is £26,500; the average house price is thus nearly 16 times the average salary.

==Transport==
The parish is crossed from east to west by both the Great Western Main Line and the A329. The railway is mostly hidden in a deep cutting and the nearest stations are those at and . Purley is served by Reading Buses service 16 and Thames Travel service 143. For those with mobility problems, ReadiBus provides door to door minibus services and the Pangbourne and District Volunteer Centre provides help getting to medical facilities. Mapledurham Lock, on the Thames, is within the parish, despite its name.

==Education==
Purley has two primary schools with three other primary schools and Denefield Academy within a short distance of its boundaries.

==Amenities==
Purley is bounded to south and west by the North Wessex Downs area of outstanding natural beauty and has a good range of habitats from river and woodland supporting a diverse range of creatures. The Thames Path beside the river and a set of 12 designated footpaths provide many opportunities for ramblers. There are two recreation areas, a bowling green and Pike Shaw woods in the ownership of the parish council. There are three community halls: The Barn, the Memorial Hall and St Mary&#x27;s Church hall, which host a large number of clubs and societies.

==Church==
The parish church of St Mary was described as &#x27;ancient&#x27; in a founding charter of Reading Abbey in 1121. It is believed it was burnt down in 1135 in The Anarchy and replaced by a Norman church around 1150. The new church was built on an excavated platform and graves dating from the 10th century or 11th century were discovered in 1982 only about a foot below the surface. This church was modified and added to in the 14th and 17th centuries and completely rebuilt in 1870 in the Gothic revivalist style by G E Street. A further major extension was added in 1983. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

===Notable parish priests===
The list of rectors dates from the mid-14th century. Purley&#x27;s foremost clergymen suffered ejection during the 120 years of sectarian conflict commencing with Edward VI&#x27;s reign. These included Richard Gatskyll, in Edward VI&#x27;s reign, for being a Catholic, John Leke, in Mary I&#x27;s reign, for having been married, Thomas Handcock, in 1563, for not being Protestant enough for the church overseen by Elizabeth I and Daniel Reynor, in 1662, who was a Congregationalist, and so unwilling to conform to the Act of Uniformity 1662 passed after the Restoration of Charles II. The current Church of England rector is David Archer.

<text>Portpatrick is a village and civil parish in the historical county of Wigtownshire, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. It is located on the west coast of the Rhins of Galloway. The parish is about in length and in breadth, covering .

== History ==
Dating back some 700 years and built adjacent to the ruins of nearby Dunskey Castle, Portpatrick&#x27;s position on the Rhins of Galloway affords visitors views of the Northern Irish coast to the west, with cliff-top walks and beaches both north and south. The Gulf Stream, flowing in from the north, gives the coastline a pleasant climate, in which subtropical plant life can flourish.

Portpatrick has a Community Council, and an annual Life Boat Week, featuring parades, activities, and a firework display. There are bowls clubs, a golf club, many guesthouses and hotels, and rustic public houses. The village is also home to a mini putting course.

By the inner harbour is the starting point of the Southern Upland Way, a long-distance walking route to Cockburnspath on the east coast. The Portpatrick Hotel, built in 1905 and extended in 1907, sits on the cliffs above this point.

The village was used as one of the locations for the 1952 film &quot;Hunted,&quot; starring Dirk Bogarde and directed by Charles Crichton. It also featured in the BBC drama &quot;Two Thousand Acres of Sky&quot; as a stand-in for Portree.

== Features ==

=== Harbour ===
Portpatrick village was founded on fishing, operating from the sandy, crescent-shaped harbour that remains the focal point of the village. It was the principal port for goods and mail traffic to Ireland from the 17th century, but the strong winds across the North Channel made this impractical. In 1770 John Smeaton constructed the town&#x27;s first proper harbour. In 1821, John Rennie was appointed to create a new harbour defined by two new piers. The north pier collapsed in 1839, but the south remains standing. The harbour&#x27;s inner basin was built between 1861 and 1863, but by then, the main goods route to Ireland was via Stranraer, and services went into decline.

=== St Patrick&#x27;s Church ===
This ruined church, dating from 1629, may itself stand on the ruins of an earlier church, known as St Patrick&#x27;s Chapel. The circular tower may date from the 1520s, and originally stood on its own. Its unusual shape (for Scotland) may mean that it was either a lighthouse for the harbour, or heavily influenced by Irish architecture.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, when Portpatrick was an important ferry port for passengers, postal mail and freight between Ireland and Scotland, the village was described as the Gretna Green for Ireland. There was a daily packet boat from Donaghadee, and marriages for couples from Ireland were conducted by the Church of Scotland minister in Portpatrick, although according to Brack (1997) he often overlooked the rules about the publication of banns or the required period of residence. It&#x27;s believed that happy couples could disembark, complete the ceremony, and be back on board within an hour.

The graveyard around the church contains memorials to many victims of shipwrecks in nearby waters. Joined to the original chapel was a district by the name of the Black Quarter of Inch. When the church was rebuilt in 1629, the Black Quarter was disjoined from Inch and erected as the Parish of Montgomorie. The name of the parish however was changed after only two or three years to that of Portpatrick.

=== Railway ===
Portpatrick railway station was completed in 1861. It was the original terminus of the Portpatrick Railway, in order to serve new steam packet services across the North Channel. After a new harbour was built in Stranraer, Portpatrick declined again as a cross-channel port, and the station closed on 6 February 1950. Portpatrick would likely be the eastern terminus of the proposed road and rail Irish Sea Bridge.

=== Dunskey Castle ===

 south of the village is Dunskey Castle, reached via a steep trail incorporating steps and a narrow bridge. The site has seen at least two castles, though the present ruins date from the 16th century.

=== Cairn Pat (Cairnpot) Hill Fort or settlement ===
A large fort or walled settlement enclosed an area of , about , within two walls, covered on the west by two ramparts set about and apart, with external ditches. A third rampart thick by high was on the southern approach, outside of which was a low bank about wide. On the west-north-west arc of the second wall there was an entrance gap about wide. On the north a road passed diagonally through the defences from the north-west. From the south-east a natural hollow ran out from the fort, flanked on the west by a face of outcropping rock. At the head of it on the west side within the inner rampart were foundations of a small circular structure measuring internally about and overall .

==Portpatrick Navtex transmissions==
Portpatrick is the base from which &quot;Navtex&quot; transmissions for the seas North and West of the UK are broadcast. For the purpose of extended Shipping forecasts, the Met Office uses Portpatrick as the name of the forecast area covering the sea between South-East Iceland and Lundy, including the waters around Ireland

<doc id="1230676" wikidata="Q420470" url="?curid=1230676" title="Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator">
<text>Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTСR) is a membrane protein and anion channel in vertebrates that is encoded by the &quot;CFTR&quot; gene.

Geneticist Lap-Chee Tsui and his team identified the &quot;CFTR&quot; gene in 1989 as the gene linked with CF (cystic fibrosis).

The &quot;CFTR&quot; gene codes for an ABC transporter-class ion channel protein that conducts chloride and bicarbonate ions across epithelial cell membranes. Mutations of the &quot;CFTR&quot; gene affecting anion channel function lead to dysregulation of epithelial lining fluid (mucus) transport in the lung, pancreas and other organs, resulting in cystic fibrosis. Complications include thickened mucus in the lungs with frequent respiratory infections, and pancreatic insufficiency giving rise to malnutrition and diabetes. These conditions lead to chronic disability and reduced life expectancy. In male patients, the progressive obstruction and destruction of the developing vas deferens (spermatic cord) and epididymis appear to result from abnormal intraluminal secretions, causing congenital absence of the vas deferens and male infertility, and found associated with an imbalance of fatty acids.
== Tissue and intracellular localization==

The CFTR is found in the epithelial cells of many organs including the lung, liver, pancreas, digestive tract, and the female reproductive tract and male reproductive tract including the testis, Sertoli cells, spermatozoa. epididymis, and the vas deferens.

In the airways of the lung, CFTR is most highly expressed by rare specialized cells called pulmonary ionocytes. In the skin, CFTR is strongly expressed in the sebaceous and eccrine sweat glands. In the eccrine glands, CFTR is located on the apical membrane of the epithelial cells that make up the duct of these sweat glands.

Normally, the protein allows movement of chloride, bicarbonate and thiocyanate ions (with a negative charge) out of an epithelial cell into the airway surface liquid and mucus. Positively charged sodium ions follow passively, increasing the total electrolyte concentration in the mucus, resulting in the movement of water out of the cell via osmosis.

In epithelial cells with motile cilia lining the bronchus and the oviduct, CFTR is located on the apical cell membrane but not on cilia. In contrast, ENaC (Epithelial sodium channel) is located along the entire length of the cilia.

In sweat glands, defective CFTR results in reduced transport of sodium chloride and sodium thiocyanate in the resorptive duct and therefore saltier sweat. This is the basis of a clinically important sweat test for cystic fibrosis often used diagnostically with genetic screening.

== Gene ==

The gene that encodes the human CFTR protein is found on chromosome 7, on the long arm at position q31.2. from base pair 116,907,253 to base pair 117,095,955. &quot;CFTR&quot; orthologs occur in the jawed vertebrates.

Each individual inherits two copies of the &quot;CFTR&quot; (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene. However, some of the inherited copies have been altered. So far, the &quot;CFTR&quot; gene has been associated with over 700 distinct mutations. An individual with CF inherits two defective copies of the &quot;CFTR&quot; gene. These mutations might be heterozygous, meaning they include two different mutations, and homozygous, meaning they involve the same mutation. Delta F508 is the most common mutation, accounting for more than 70% of all mutations. Those who are homozygous for Delta F508 are commonly affected by pancreatic insufficiency.

The &quot;CFTR&quot; gene has been used in animals as a nuclear DNA phylogenetic marker. Large genomic sequences of this gene have been used to explore the phylogeny of the major groups of mammals, and confirmed the grouping of placental orders into four major clades: Xenarthra, Afrotheria, Laurasiatheria, and Euarchonta plus Glires.

=== Mutations ===
Nearly 1000 cystic fibrosis-causing mutations have been described. The most common mutation, DeltaF508 (ΔF508) primarily known as a processing mutation which results from a deletion (Δ) of three nucleotides which results in a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine (F) at the 508th position on the protein. As a result, the protein does not fold normally and is more quickly degraded. The vast majority of mutations are infrequent. The distribution and frequency of mutations varies among different populations which has implications for genetic screening and counseling.

Drug discovery for therapeutics to address CF in all patients is complicated due to a large number of disease-causing mutations. Ideally, a library of cell lines and cell-based assays corresponding to all mutants is required to screen for broadly-active drug candidates. Cell engineering methods including fluorogenic oligonucleotide signaling probes may be used to detect and isolate clonal cell lines for each mutant.

Mutations consist of replacements, duplications, deletions or shortenings in the &quot;CFTR&quot; gene. This may result in proteins that may not function, work less effectively, are more quickly degraded, or are present in inadequate numbers.

It has been hypothesized that mutations in the &quot;CFTR&quot; gene may confer a selective advantage to heterozygous individuals. Cells expressing a mutant form of the CFTR protein are resistant to invasion by the &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot; bacterium, the agent of typhoid fever, and mice carrying a single copy of mutant &quot;CFTR&quot; are resistant to diarrhea caused by cholera toxin.

The most common mutations that cause cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency in humans are:
===DeltaF508===
DeltaF508 (ΔF508), full name CFTRΔF508 or F508del-CFTR (rs113993960), is a specific mutation within the CFTR gene involving deletion of three nucleotides spanning codons for amino acid positions 507 and 508 of the CFTR gene on chromosome 7, which ultimately results in the loss of a single codon for the amino acid phenylalanine (F). A person with the CFTRΔF508 mutation will produce an abnormal CFTR protein that lacks this phenylalanine residue and which cannot fold properly. Most of this mutated protein does not escape the endoplasmic reticulum for further processing. The small amounts that reach the plasma membrane are destabilized and the anion channel opens infrequently. Having two copies of this mutation (one inherited from each parent) is by far the most common cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), responsible for nearly two-thirds of mutations worldwide.

====Effects====

The CFTR protein is largely expressed in cells of the pancreas, intestinal and respiratory epithelia, and all exocrine glands. When properly folded, it is shuttled to the cell membrane, where it becomes a transmembrane protein that forms aqueous channels allowing the flow of chloride and bicarbonate ions out of cells; it also simultaneously inhibits the uptake of sodium ions by another channel protein. Both of these functions help to maintain an ion gradient that causes osmosis to draw water out of the cells. The ΔF508 mutation leads to the misfolding of CFTR and its eventual degradation in the ER. In organisms with two complements of the mutation, the protein is almost entirely absent from the cell membrane, and these critical ion transport functions are not performed.
Having a homozygous pair of genes with the ΔF508 mutation prevents the CFTR protein from assuming its normal position in the cell membrane. This causes increased water retention in cells, corresponding dehydration of the extracellular space, and an associated cascade of effects on various parts of the body. These effects include: thicker mucous membranes in the epithelia of afflicted organs; obstruction of narrow respiratory airways as a result of thicker mucus and inhibition of the free movement of muco cilia; congenital absence of the vas deferens due to increased mucus thickness during fetal development; pancreatic insufficiency due to blockage of the pancreatic duct with mucus; and increased risk of respiratory infection due to build-up of thick, nutrient-rich mucus where bacteria thrive. These are the symptoms of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder; however, ΔF508 is not the only mutation that causes this disorder.

Being a heterozygous carrier (having a single copy of ΔF508) results in decreased water loss during diarrhea because malfunctioning or absent CFTR proteins cannot maintain stable ion gradients across cell membranes. Typical nucleotide-binding-up of both Cl− and Na+ ions inside affected cells, creating a hypotonic solution outside the cells and causing water to diffuse into the cells by osmosis. Several studies indicate that heterozygous carriers are at increased risk for various symptoms. For example, it has been shown that heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis is associated with increased airway reactivity, and heterozygotes may be at risk for poor pulmonary function. Heterozygotes with wheeze have been shown to be at higher risk for poor pulmonary function or development and progression of chronic obstructive lung disease. One gene for cystic fibrosis is sufficient to produce mild lung abnormalities even in the absence of infection.

====Mechanism====
The &quot;CFTR&quot; gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7, at position q31.2, and ultimately codes for a sequence of 1,480 amino acids. Normally, the three DNA base pairs A-T-C (paired with T-A-G on the opposite strand) at the gene&#x27;s 507th position form the template for the mRNA codon A-U-C for isoleucine, while the three DNA base pairs T-T-T (paired with A-A-A) at the adjacent 508th position form the template for the codon U-U-U for phenylalanine. The ΔF508 mutation is a deletion of the C-G pair from position 507 along with the first two T-A pairs from position 508, leaving the DNA sequence A-T-T (paired with T-A-A) at position 507, which is transcribed into the mRNA codon A-U-U. Since A-U-U also codes for isoleucine, position 507&#x27;s amino acid does not change, and the mutation&#x27;s net effect is equivalent to a deletion (&quot;Δ&quot;) of the sequence resulting in the codon for phenylalanine at position 508.

====Prevalence====

ΔF508 is present on at least one copy of chromosome 7 in approximately one in 30 Caucasians. Presence of the mutation on both copies causes the autosomal recessive disease cystic fibrosis. Scientists have estimated that the original mutation occurred over 52,000 years ago in Northern Europe though cystic fibrosis patients of other ethnicities are also known to harbor the mutation. The young allele age may be a consequence of past selection. One hypothesis as to why the otherwise detrimental mutation has been maintained by natural selection is that a single copy may present a positive effect by reducing water loss during cholera, though the introduction of pathogenic &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; into Europe did not occur until the late 18th century. Another theory posits that CF carriers (heterozygotes for ΔF508) are more resistant to typhoid fever, since CFTR has been shown to act as a receptor for &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot; bacteria to enter intestinal epithelial cells.
Cystic fibrosis ΔF508 heterozygotes may be overrepresented among individuals with asthma and may have poorer lung function than non-carriers. Carriers of a single CF mutation have a higher prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis than the general population. Approximately 50% of cystic fibrosis cases in Europe are due to homozygous ΔF508 mutations (this varies widely by region), while the allele frequency of ΔF508 is about 70%. The remaining cases are caused by over 1,500 other mutations, including R117H, 1717-1G&gt;A, and 2789+56G&gt;A. These mutations, when combined with each other or even a single copy of ΔF508, may cause CF symptoms. The genotype is not strongly correlated with severity of the CF, though specific symptoms have been linked to certain mutations.

== Structure ==
The &quot;CFTR&quot; gene is approximately 189 kb in length, with 27 exons and 26 introns. CFTR is a glycoprotein and is found on the surface of many epithelial cells in the body. CFTR consists of five domains, which include two transmembrane or membrane-spanning domains, two nucleotide-binding domains and a regulatory domain. The transmembrane domains are each connected to a nucleotide binding domain (NBD) in the cytoplasm. The first NBD is connected to the second transmembrane domain by a regulatory &quot;R&quot; domain that is a unique feature of CFTR, not present in other ABC transporters which carries 19 predicted sites for protein kinase A(PKA). Six of these have been reported to be phosphorylated in vivo. The ion channel only opens when its R-domain has been phosphorylated by PKA and ATP is bound at the NBDs. Phosphorylation displaces the disordered R domain from positions preventing NBD dimerization and opening. The amino-terminus is part of the lasso motif which anchors into the cell membrane. The carboxyl terminal of the protein is anchored to the cytoskeleton by a PDZ-interacting domain. 

== Location and function ==
The &quot;CFTR&quot; gene is made up of 27 exons that encode its gene makeup and is found on the long (q) arm of chromosome 7 at locus 31.2. Exons are DNA fragments that provide the code for a protein structure. CFTR functions as phosphorylation and ATP-gated anion channel, increasing the conductance for certain anions (e.g. Cl−) to flow down their electrochemical gradient. ATP-driven conformational changes in CFTR open and close a gate to allow the transmembrane flow of anions down their electrochemical gradient. This in contrast to other ABC proteins, in which ATP-driven conformational changes fuel uphill substrate transport across cellular membranes. Essentially, CFTR is an ion channel that evolved as a &#x27;broken&#x27; ABC transporter that leaks when in the open conformation.

CFTRs consist of five domains including two trans-membrane domains, each linked to a nucleotide-binding domain. CFTR also contains another domain called the regulatory domain. Other members of the ABC transporter superfamily are involved in the uptake of nutrients in prokaryotes, or in the export of a variety of substrates in eukaryotes. ABC transporters have evolved to transduce the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to the uphill movement of substrates across the cell membrane. They have two main conformations, one where the cargo binding site is facing the cytosol or inward facing (ATP free), and one where it is outward facing (ATP bound). ATP binds to each nucleotide-binding domain, which results in the subsequent NBD dimerization, leading to the rearrangement of the transmembrane helices. This changes the accessibility of the cargo binding site from an inward-facing position to an outward facing one. ATP binding, and the hydrolysis that follows, drives the alternative exposure of the cargo binding site, ensuring a unidirectional transport of cargo against an electrochemical gradient. In CFTR, alternating between an inward-facing conformation to an outward-facing one results in channel gating. In particular, NBD dimerization (favored by ATP binding) is coupled to transition to an outward-facing conformation in which an open transmembrane pathway for anions is formed. Subsequent hydrolysis (at the canonical active site, site 2, including Walker motifs of NBD2) destabilizes the NBD dimer and favors return to the inward-facing conformation, in which the anion permeation pathway is closed off.

== Clinical implications ==
Different &quot;CFTR&quot; mutations can lead to varying degrees of cystic fibrosis severity. Common symptoms include chronic lung infections, pancreatic insufficiency, and high sweat chloride levels. Mutation-specific therapies, such as CFTR modulators, have been developed to address these specific genetic defects.

=== Interactions ===

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator has been shown to interact with:

* DNAJC5,
* GOPC,
* PDZK1,
* PRKCE,
* SLC4A8,
* SNAP23,
* SLC9A3R1,
* SLC9A3R2, and
* STX1A,
It is inhibited by the anti-diarrhoea drug crofelemer.

== Related conditions ==

* Congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens: Males with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens most often have a mild mutation (a change that allows partial function of the gene) in one copy of the CFTR gene and a cystic fibrosis-causing mutation in the other copy of CFTR.
* Cystic fibrosis: More than 1,800 mutations in the CFTR gene have been found but the majority of these have not been associated with cystic fibrosis. Most of these mutations either substitute one amino acid (a building block of proteins) for another amino acid in the CFTR protein or delete a small amount of DNA in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation, called ΔF508, is a deletion (Δ) of one amino acid (phenylalanine) at position 508 in the CFTR protein. This altered protein never reaches the cell membrane because it is degraded shortly after it is made. All disease-causing mutations in the CFTR gene prevent the channel from functioning properly, leading to a blockage of the movement of salt and water into and out of cells. As a result of this blockage, cells that line the passageways of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs produce abnormally thick, sticky mucus. This mucus obstructs the airways and glands, causing the characteristic signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis. In addition, only thin mucus can be removed by cilia; thick mucus cannot, so it traps bacteria that give rise to chronic infections.
* Cholera: ADP-ribosylation caused by cholera toxin results in increased production of cyclic AMP which in turn opens the CFTR channel which leads to Over secretion of Cl−. Na+ and H2O follow Cl− into the small intestine, resulting in dehydration and loss of electrolytes.

==Drug target==
CFTR has been a drug target in efforts to find treatments for related conditions. Ivacaftor (brand name Kalydeco, developed as VX-770) is a medication approved by the FDA in 2012, for people with cystic fibrosis who have specific CFTR mutations. Ivacaftor was developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and is the first medication that treats the underlying cause rather than the symptoms of the disease. and &quot;a wonder drug&quot;

The combination vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor (brand name Alyftrek) was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2024.

<text>Yang Manchun is the name given to the Goguryeo commander of Ansi-Seong Fortress in the 640s. Ansi Fortress was located on the Goguryeo–Tang border, probably present-day Haicheng. Yang is sometimes credited with saving the kingdom by his successful defense against Tang Taizong.

==Name==
The real name of the defender of Ansi Fortress is unclear. Kim Busik, in his &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; (Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms), lamented that the name of the steadfast commander of Ansi Fortress was unknown:

However, an author by the name of Xiong Damu from the Ming dynasty used the name Liang Wanchun (梁萬春) to refer to the defender in his Historical Fiction novel &quot;Tangshu Zhizhuan Tongsu Yanyi&quot;. During the Japanese invasions of Korea, the Ming generals Wu Zongdao and Li Shifa said to Yun Geunsu that the defender&#x27;s name is Liang Wanchun. In 1669, Hyeonjong of Joseon asked Song Jungil for his name and he gave his name as Ryang Manchun, the Korean way of pronouncing the Hanja &quot;梁萬春&quot;. &quot;The Collected works of Master Dongchundang&quot; (동춘당선생별집, 同春堂先生別集) by (송준길, 宋浚吉), first compiled in 1768, includes the passage: &quot;Someone asked, &#x27;What was the name of the commander of Ansi fortress?&#x27; Jungil replied, &#x27;It was Ryang Manchun. He skillfully checked the army of Taizong and so might we very well call him &quot;seonsu seongja&quot; (선수성자, 善守城者, &quot;capable defender of fortresses&quot;).&#x27;&quot; However, due to the Korean Pronunciation rule called Tu&#x27;eum Beopchik (두음법칙), Ryang Manchun (량만춘) was pronounced as Yang Manchun (양만춘) in some Korean dialects. As such, his name slowly began to be mistakenly interpreted as (楊萬春). In &quot;The Jehol Diary&quot; written by Park Ji-won in the 18th century includes the following: &quot;When Yang Manchun, the master of Anshi-sŏng Fortress, shot an arrow and put out the eye of the Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty, the emperor assembled his army under the wall. This was not the signal for an immediate attack, but to demonstrate the Emperor&#x27;s generosity in granting Yang Manchun one hundred p&#x27;il roll of silk, praising him for defending the Fortress successfully for his own Korean king.&quot; In time Yang Manchun came into general use as the name of the defender of Ansi Fortress.

==Involvement in the Goguryeo–Tang War==

In 642, Yeon Gaesomun killed King Yeongnyu and seized military control over the country. However, although Yeon had quickly gained control over the rest of the country, Yang Manchun refused to surrender Ansi fortress. After a lengthy siege and repeated unsuccessful attempts to storm the fortress, Yeon was forced to withdraw and allow Yang to keep his position as fortress commander. This proved to be to his advantage.

In 645, Taizong led a campaign against Goguryeo. Some Goguryeo border fortresses fell early, but Tang was unable to reduce Ansi fortress. Goguryeo sent a force reported at 150,000 to raise the siege of Ansi fortress, but the force was unable to reach it. Despite its siege of Ansi, the Tang army was unable to force its capitulation. Taizong eventually ordered the construction of a large earthen siege ramp, which Yang instead captured and used as part of his defense. When winter approached, Tang forces were forced to withdraw.

The siege of Ansi fortress is related in detail (but without the commander&#x27;s name) in the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, Goguryeo vol. 9. (vol. 21 overall).

<text>Marion Elizabeth (Walsh) de Chastelain was an American-born Canadian who worked as an agent for the British Secret Intelligence Service during World War II, passing on information from German-controlled Vichy French embassy to the Allies.

De Chatelain was born in Freehold, New Jersey, USA, on 24 May 1910. The daughter of a businessman working for Standard Oil of New Jersey in Romania, she was educated in Switzerland and at the Sorbonne, from where she graduated with a degree in international law at the age of 21.

A linguist, she married Alfred George Gardyne de Chastelain in Bucharest in the early 1930s and they had two children, Jacqueline, born in 1936 and John, born in 1937, who would become a well-known general in the Canadian Forces. Marion knew how to speak 7 languages, which helped her job as a spy become easier.

At the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Germany in 1939, she took her children to stay with relatives in England and returned to Romania. In 1940 she returned to England and took the children by sea to live with her parents in New York, USA. There she was recruited to work for Canadian Sir William Stephenson (to whom Winston Churchill had given the codename &quot;INTREPID&quot;), travelling regularly to Washington, D.C. to debrief agents working on behalf of the allies for Stephenson. Working with Amy Elizabeth Thorpe, De Chastelain was able to establish covert relationships between British and American intelligence agencies.

In 1943, two years after the entry of the USA into the war following Pearl Harbor, and the consequent closure of Axis embassies in Washington, her work for Stephenson was rendered less important and arrangements were made for her to take up a position with the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS — later MI6) in England. Accordingly, she sailed from Halifax, Nova Scotia with her children to Liverpool, and then by rail to London, where she learnt that her husband had been captured in Romania.

Sending her children to boarding school in the north of England to avoid the bombing, she remained in London working with SIS until the war&#x27;s end and her husband&#x27;s return. After the war she moved to Canada with her family and eventually to Australia, with her husband. When he died shortly after their return to Canada from Australia, she worked for Westburne International Industries Oil Division in Edmonton, Alberta, as the Executive Assistant to the President, until her retirement in her seventies.

She then lived with her daughter Jacqueline in Canmore, Alberta, until her death on 17 January 2000, shortly before her 90th birthday, her fifth great grandchild&#x27;s birth and daughters birthday.

The story of her wartime activities was included in the book series &quot;The Canadians: Biography of a Nation&quot;, edited by Patrick Watson. It was also made into a documentary program by History Television, entitled &quot;Family Secrets: Marion de Chastelain&quot;.

<doc id="1230690" wikidata="Q3525594" url="?curid=1230690" title="Thomas Steers">
<text>Thomas Steers was thought to have been born in 1672 in Kent and died in 1750. He was England&#x27;s first major civil engineer and built many canals, the world&#x27;s first commercial wet dock (the Old Dock at Liverpool), St. George&#x27;s Church at the site of Liverpool Castle, and a theatre. He designed Salthouse Dock in Liverpool, which was completed by Henry Berry after Steers&#x27; death.

==Early life==
Thomas Steers was born in 1672, probably at Deptford or Rotherhithe. He is thought to have had a good education, in view of his obvious skills in mathematics, and he joined the army during his teenage years. He was part of William of Orange&#x27;s 4th Regiment of Foot (The King&#x27;s Own), which fought at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and subsequently campaigned in the Low Countries against the French until the Peace of Namur was signed in 1697. He probably learnt about hydraulics at this time, a skill which served him well in later years. In 1698 or 1699 he married Henrietta Maria Barber, and her father gave them a house in Queen Street, Rotherhithe.

At the time, the Great Dock at Rotherhithe was being constructed, on land leased from Elizabeth Howland, which formed part of the Howland Estate. There is no record of Steers&#x27;s direct involvement in the project, although he produced a survey of the completed docks in 1707, and seems to have been employed as a surveyor for the estate. A lease agreement at the time described him as a house-carpenter.

==Engineering==
In 1708, plans for a dock at Liverpool, similar to that at Rotherhithe, were formulated, and had been drawn up by George Sorocold and Henry Huss by mid-1709. Neither man accepted the offer to act as engineer for the construction of the docks. On 17 May 1710, the Town Council learned that Steers was in Liverpool, and had his own designs for the project, which involved reclaiming land from the Pool, rather than building the dock of existing land. The precise reason for Steers&#x27; arrival in Liverpool is not clear, but may well be connected to the rise to power of James Stanley, who became mayor in 1707 and Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire until 1710, and who had noticed Steers in Flanders, while commanding the 16th Regiment of Foot. Steers&#x27; design was accepted, and the construction was overseen by him, assisted by William Braddock. He also contracted for some of the excavation work, and although it was incomplete at the time, the dock opened for shipping in 1715. A tidal basin and three graving docks or dry docks were authorised by another Act of Parliament obtained in 1717, and during their construction, various alterations and extensions were made to the original dock. The works were completed in 1721. Since 1717, Steers had also acted at Dock Master, for which he was paid £50 per year, and Braddock had been the Water Bailiff. From 1724, he took over Braddock&#x27;s role as well, though was no longer paid, as this post included a number of perks and fees.

Concurrently with his work on the Liverpool Docks, Steers was active in other projects.
He surveyed the rivers Irwell and Mersey from Bank Quay at Warrington to Manchester in 1712. An Act of Parliament authorizing the Mersey and Irwell Navigation was passed in 1721 and the work, which included eight locks in a distance of to overcome a rise of , was completed about 1725. It is generally believed he was the engineer. The authorising Act named him as one of the Undertakers.

He also made surveys for the Douglas Navigation which connected the Ribble estuary to Wigan in 1712, and was again named as an Undertaker in the Act of Parliament obtained in 1720. He built a lock and a bridge, straightened a section of the river, and started the construction of a tidal lock, but his partner William Squire, who was raising finance for the scheme in London, became involved in the South Sea Bubble, and appears to have lost most of the money he raised. With the money gone, Steers moved on. The navigation was eventually completed in 1742, and carried coal from Wigan to Liverpool and onwards to Ireland by ship.

His most significant navigation achievement was the Newry Canal, in Ireland, which was the first summit-level canal in the British Isles. The promoters asked him to act as engineer for the scheme in 1729, but then declined to pay him the fees he requested, and so the initial construction work was overseen by Edward Lovett Pearce. Pearce died in 1734, and his assistant Richard Castle took over the role. Steers returned to the project in 1736, when he conducted a survey of the existing work. Castle was sacked in December 1736, and Steers then supervised construction until 1741, working on a part-time basis. The work took longer than expected, and the canal finally opened in the spring of 1742. The of canal included 13 locks, and ran from Newry, where it connected to Carlingford Lough and the sea by a narrow channel, which was made into a ship canal in the 1760s. At its northern end it ran to Portadown where it joined the Upper Bann River to reach Lough Neagh. It was built to transport coal from the Tyrone collieries to Dublin.

In order to build locks with a larger fall than was possible with conventional gate paddles, Steers built two of the locks with sluices and ground paddles, which fed water into the bottom of the lock through the side walls. Water supply for the summit level was taken from local streams, supplemented by water from Lough Shark, which was used as a reservoir. As a whole, the work was not well executed, and the innovative locks had to be rebuilt soon after 1750.

==Other activity==
Besides his work on docks and canals, Steers was involved with a wide range of other projects. Even the Mersey and Irwell Navigation and the Douglas Navigation were promoted not just to make carriage of existing trade easier, but to generate new trade which would contribute to the prosperity of the region. Jointly with Sir Cleave Moore and Sir Thomas Johnson, he promoted the Liverpool Waterworks in 1720. He set up a smithy making anchors near the Liverpool Docks, and was a partner in the &quot;Dove&quot;, a ship which traded between Liverpool and the West Indies.

He appears to have been a keen amateur architect (before that term was in popular parlance) and as well as the work on Liverpool Old Dock, executed alongside chief mason Edward Litherland, is paid in the accounts of The Blue Coat School (1715) once again with Litherland, &quot;a new Street, called Chorley Street or Squire&#x27;s Garden&quot; (1720), St. George&#x27;s Church (1725) (Litherland cited as mason) and what would become Salt House Dock once again winning the contract along regular collaborator Litherland. Their working relationship ended with Litherland&#x27;s death in 1739. His best known architectural work was that of &quot;Seel&#x27;s House&quot; on Hanover Street, Liverpool which would later become a bank before making way for the Liverpool One Tesco supermarket. It is highly likely that he designed a number of other buildings in Liverpool, no longer extant, including buildings on Paradise Street.

In 1725 he became a commissioner for the turnpike road from Prescot to Liverpool, and drew up plans for St George&#x27;s Church on the site of the Liverpool Castle. He subsequently was responsible for the construction of its foundations and steeple. He built houses for poor and destitute seamen in 1739, and opened the Old Ropery Theatre in the following year.
Steers became a Freeman of the town of Liverpool in 1713, and served on the town council in 1717. In 1719 and 1722, he was a Town Bailiff, became mayor of Liverpool from 1739 to 1740, and was an Out-burgess in Wigan in 1746. He was responsible for the fortification of Liverpool during the Jacobite rising of 1745.

==Family==
Steers&#x27; first marriage to Henrietta Maria ended in 1717 with her death. Of their seven children, four died in childhood, while the other three are thought to have become seamen, and all had died by 1732. In 1719 he married Ann Tibington, who came from Rotherhithe and was the widow of a seaman. She had a son called John, and they had four children of their own, two of which died in childhood. He died in 1750, and was buried in the grounds of St Peter&#x27;s Church. His only surviving son, Spencer, carried on his anchor making business after his death.

There was also a Thomas Steers, lime burner of Greenwich (probably the owner and/or digger of &quot;Jack Cade&#x27;s Cavern&quot; and of a nearby sand mine) who was born about this time and in the right area, but who was probably not the same person. Other Steers were involved in pottery. This hints at an extended Steers family with interests in kilns and building mortar.

==Legacy==
Despite his considerable contribution to civil engineering, his death went almost unnoticed, although the civil engineer John Smeaton, writing to the Calder and Hebble Navigation in 1757, noted that Steers was an esteemed man of character and ability in his profession. He built the first successful commercial dock in the world, and the United Kingdom&#x27;s first summit level canal. He trained his assistants well, as several went on to have illustrious careers of their own. Above all, he understood his work in its wider social context, being active in the politics and trade of Liverpool, and understanding the need for the town to be well-connected to its hinterland. His work paved the way for Liverpool to become one of the world&#x27;s greatest ports, and was a contributory factor in the industrial revolution which began shortly after his death.

<doc id="1230691" wikidata="Q13632029" url="?curid=1230691" title="Chester Thordarson">
<text>Chester Hjortur Thordarson (May 12, 1867 – January 6, 1945) — born Hjörtur Þórðarson — was an Icelandic-American inventor and manufacturer of electrical apparatus who eventually held nearly a hundred technology patents related to transformers, inductors, high voltage coils, and more.

==Biography==
Thordarson immigrated to the United States from Iceland in 1873 with his parents Gudrun Grimsdotter and Thordur Arnason. In 1887, Thordarson took a job in Chicago, Illinois, working for Chicago Edison Co. In 1895, he founded the Thordarson Electric Manufacturing Company, a manufacturing company in Chicago that produced industrial and commercial transformers. Thordarson&#x27;s company is now called Thordarson Meissner, Inc. and has locations in Mount Carmel, Illinois, and Henderson, Nevada.

He was instrumental in the development of the modern energy transmission grid with his work in transformers. He achieved his first distinction at the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair in St. Louis, where for the Purdue University exhibit he designed and built the first million-volt transformer. For his efforts he won the fair&#x27;s gold medal.

==Legacy==

===Rock Island===

In 1910, Thordarson began purchasing property on Rock Island, an island off the tip Wisconsin&#x27;s Door Peninsula. Thordarson established a private vacation retreat on Rock Island. He was intensely interested in preserving the island’s natural beauty. In 1965 the state of Wisconsin purchased Rock Island from his heirs. Thordarson&#x27;s former estate has been designated Rock Island State Park. His buildings, including the water tower, were added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Thordarson Estate Historic District during 1985.

===Book collection===
Thordarson bequeathed his book collection to the University of Wisconsin. The Thordarson collection was estimated to be worth one million dollars in 1945 (equivalent to $ in ) and led to the establishment of the rare books room of the University of Wisconsin Memorial Library. Jen Christian Bay, a member of the Bibliographical Society of America, commented on the collection in 1929:
*&quot;Of William Copland, &quot;The Craft of Grafting&quot; (1560), two copies are known, one in the Thordarson Collection&quot;
*&quot;Of the greatest [herbal] of all, the &quot;Hortus Sanitatis&quot;, Mr. Thordarson&#x27;s copy of the edition of 1561 is a remarkably beautiful copy...&quot;
*[Of the 1540 &quot;A Boke of the Proertyes of Herbes&quot;:] &quot;This book is one of Mr. Thordarson&#x27;s discoveries; no copy is known in any other library.&quot;
*[Of H. Baker&#x27;s &quot;The Wellspring of Sciences&quot;:] &quot;The British Museum seemingly possesses no copy with an earlier date than 1574. Mr Thordarson&#x27;s copy [of 1564] seems unique.&quot;

==Awards==
Among his awards and honors, the University of Wisconsin and the University of Iceland conferred honorary doctorate degrees. He was awarded medals from the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904 and the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in 1916. King Christian X of Denmark presented Thordarson with the Order of the Falcon in 1939.

==Patents==

==Death==
Thordarson died of heart failure in Chicago, Illinois on January 6, 1945.

<text>De Roy is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, just behind the southwestern limb. This portion of the lunar surface is brought into view during favorable librations, allowing observation of this formation. However the crater is viewed from the side when watched from the Earth, and little detail can be seen. De Roy lies to the west of the crater Arrhenius, and east of the larger Boltzmann.

This crater has a worn and rounded outer rim, forming a slightly irregular circle. A pair of tiny craterlets lie along the southeast rim, and there is a narrow cleft in the northern wall. The interior floor is level and nearly featureless, with only a few tiny crater pits to mark the surface.

This crater lies within the Mendel-Rydberg Basin, a 630 km wide impact basin of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to De Roy.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* De Roy X — &quot;See&quot; Chadwick.

<doc id="1230710" wikidata="Q7731604" url="?curid=1230710" title="The Education of Henry Adams">
<text>The Education of Henry Adams is an autobiography that records the struggle of the Bostonian Henry Adams (1838–1918), in his later years, to come to terms with the dawning 20th century, so different from the world of his youth. It is also a sharp critique of 19th-century educational theory and practice. In 1907, Adams began privately circulating copies of a limited edition printed at his own expense. Commercial publication of the book had to await its author&#x27;s 1918 death, whereupon it won the 1919 Pulitzer Prize. The Modern Library placed it first in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the 20th century.

==Subject==
&quot;The Education&quot; is more a record of Adams&#x27;s introspection and his observations than of his deeds. It is an extended meditation on the social, technological, political, and intellectual changes that occurred over Adams&#x27;s lifetime. Adams concluded that his traditional education failed to help him come to terms with these rapid changes, hence, his need for self-education. The organizing thread of the book is how the &quot;proper&quot; schooling and other aspects of his youth was time wasted, thus, his search for self-education through experiences, friendships, and reading.

Many aspects of the contemporary world emerged during the half-century between the Civil War and World War I, a half-century coinciding with Adams&#x27;s adult life. An important theme of &quot;The Education&quot; is its author&#x27;s bewilderment and concern at the rapid advance in science and technology over the course of his lifetime, sometimes now called Second Industrial Revolution, but incarnated in his term &quot;dynamo&quot;. &quot;The Education&quot; mentions the recent discovery of X-rays and radioactivity, and shows a familiarity with radio waves in his citation of Marconi and Branly. Adams purchased an automobile as early as 1902, to make better use of a summer in France researching &quot;Mont Saint Michel and Chartres&quot;. He correctly predicted that the 20th century would have even more explosive changes. Adams repeatedly laments that his formal education, grounded in the classics, history, and literature, as was then the fashion, did not give him the scientific and mathematical knowledge needed to grasp the scientific breakthroughs of the 1890s and 1900s.

Adams had direct knowledge of many notable events and persons of the 1850–1900 period, and much of the text is devoted to giving his views on them. The text is written as if readers are already familiar with the major figures and events of the time. &quot;The Education&quot; repeatedly mentions two long-standing friends of Adams, the scientific explorer of the American Far West, Clarence King, and the American diplomat, John Milton Hay, who became Secretary of State. &quot;The Education&quot; is narrated in the third person. It is frequently sarcastic and humorously self-critical.

&quot;The Education&quot; does not discuss Adams&#x27;s marriage, and the illness and 1885 suicide of his wife, Clover; it mostly leaves out the periods from 1872 to 1892. The text does not discuss what this period contributed to his education. He referred to his marriage indirectly, by for example, lamenting how the memorial he had constructed for his wife had become something of a tourist attraction.

==Context==
Henry Adams&#x27; life story is rooted in the American political aristocracy that emerged from the American Revolution. He was the grandson of the American President John Quincy Adams and great-grandson of President and founding father John Adams. His father, Charles Francis Adams, had served as ambassador to the United Kingdom during the Civil War, and had been elected to the United States House of Representatives. His brothers Brooks Adams and Charles Francis Adams Jr. were also historians of note. Henry Adams had received the finest formal education available in the United States, enjoying many other advantages, as well. This social context makes &quot;The Education&quot; so important, but the trappings of success did not mean much to a restless individualist such as Adams. Rather than take advantage of his patrician name, he sized up this and other advantages and found them wanting.

== Assessment ==
&quot;The Education&quot; is an important work of American literary nonfiction. It provides a penetrating glimpse into the intellectual and political life of the late 19th century. The Modern Library placed it first in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the 20th century.

Author and historian Garry Wills has suggested &quot;The Education&quot; contradicts much of Adams&#x27; earlier work and opinions, and has biased assessments of Adams&#x27; earlier historical works.

==In popular culture==
In his novel &quot;V.&quot;, Thomas Pynchon likens his protagonist Herbert Stencil to Henry Adams in the &quot;Education&quot;, as they both refer to themselves in the third person.

The lyrics of &quot;Long Folk Revival&quot; by Thirsty Curses include a line &quot;...it&#x27;s The New Education of Henry Adams&quot;.

<text>Haldane is a lunar impact crater that is located in Mare Smythii, near the eastern limb of the Moon. The visibility of this formation is affected by libration, and even under favorable conditions it is highly foreshortened. It lies just to the west-northwest of the crater Runge, and to the east of Carrillo. The small crater Talbot is immediately to the southwest of Haldane.

The interior of this floor has been flooded by lava, leaving only a low rim projecting up through the lunar mare. This rim is broken along the northwest face, leaving a gap into the interior. In the eastern half of the inner floor is a semi-circular feature that is concentric with the outer wall. There is also a low central ridge offset to the east of the interior midpoint.

Haldane is a somewhat extreme example of many fracture-floored craters in Mare Smythii.

The depth of Haldane is approximately 900 m from the lowest point on the floor of its northwestern quadrant to the highest point on the southwestern part of its outer rim.

The crater&#x27;s name was approved by the IAU in 1973.

<doc id="1230722" wikidata="Q601083" url="?curid=1230722" title="Marco Polo (crater)">
<text>Marco Polo is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged foothills to the south of the Montes Apenninus mountain range. It was named after Italian explorer Marco Polo. It lies just 20 kilometers to the west of the Mare Vaporum, but is otherwise located in an undistinguished region of terrain with no notable craters nearby.

This crater is elongated to the south-southeast, with a very eroded outer rim. The southern part of the rim is nearly nonexistent, and there is a narrow cleft at the northern end of the crater. Portions of the rim still remain along the western and northeastern sides, but appear as little more than curved ridges. The interior has little detail of interest apart from a tiny craterlet along the southwest inner wall.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Marco Polo.

<text>The SIAM Journal on Computing is a scientific journal focusing on the mathematical and formal aspects of computer science. It is published by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).

Although its official ISO abbreviation is &quot;SIAM J. Comput.&quot;, its publisher and contributors frequently use the shorter abbreviation &quot;SICOMP&quot;.

SICOMP typically hosts the special issues of the IEEE Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) and the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), where about 15% of papers published in FOCS and STOC each year are invited to these special issues. For example, Volume 48 contains 11 out of 85 papers published in FOCS 2016.

<text>The Workers Party of Bangladesh () is a communist party in Bangladesh. Rashed Khan Menon is the president of the Workers Party of Bangladesh and Fazle Hossain Badsha is the general secretary of the party.

== History ==
WPB was founded in 1980 by the Bangladesh Communist Party (Leninist), Revolutionary Communist League, Majdur Party and another group. Amal Sen was the founding general secretary.

In 1984, the party split in two factions, both using the name WPB. One group was led by Amal Sen and Nazrul Islam. The other was led by the current president of the party, Rashed Khan Menon. In 1992, they reunited.

The party participated in the programs of the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports in 2006.

In November 2008, the Workers Party protested the removal of a baul statue by the Roads and Highways Department, and Civil Aviation Authority, Bangladesh following pressure from Islamists near the Zia International Airport.

In 2010, the Haider Akbar Khan Rono-led fraction of the Workers Party of Bangladesh (reconstituted) merged with the Communist Party of Bangladesh.

WPB joined the Grand Alliance in 2014, but the party leadership openly questioned the direction of the subsequent 14 Party Alliance after the 2014 election. Rashed Khan Menon was made the Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism in the Sheikh Hasina led cabinet.

On 26 May 2016, Workers Party of Bangladesh called for the parliamentary membership of Salim Osman to be cancelled for insulting Shyamal Kanti Bhakta, the principal of Piyar Sattar Latif High School.

In the 2018 Bangladesh elections, it contested as part of the Grand Alliance along with the Bangladesh Awami League. Five candidates of the Workers Party used the election symbol of the Awami League, the boat. The candidates were Fazle Hossain Badsha from Rajshahi-2, Mustafa Lutfullah from Satkhira-1, Rashed Khan Menon from Dhaka-8, Tipu Sultan from Barisal-3, and Yeasin Ali from Thakurgaon-3. Three candidates of the party contested using the hammer symbol of the workers party. They were Ahsan Ullah from Comilla-8, Haji Bashirul Alam from Cox&#x27;s Bazar-1, and Jahirul Haque Tutul from Barisal-2. The Workers Party won four seats in the Jatiya Sangsad in the 2018 Bangladeshi general election. Lutfun Nesa Khan was elected from the reserved women&#x27;s seat from the Workers Party. The winners were Fazle Hossain Badsha from Rajshahi-2, Mustafa Lutfullah from Satkhira-1, and Rashed Khan Menon from Dhaka-8. The Awami League did not include them in the new cabinet which only had Awami League politicians.

In February 2021, the Workers Party criticised Awami League for election policy and for not taking a hardline against religion-based political parties. In December, the party asked the government to send former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia abroad for medical treatment.

<text>Spencer Jarnagin (1792June 25, 1851) was a United States Senator from Tennessee from 1843 to 1847.

== Life and career ==
Jarnagin was born in what was shortly to become Grainger County, Tennessee. He graduated from Greenville College in 1813 and after the study of law was admitted to the bar in 1817. He served in the Tennessee State Senate from 1833 to 1835. From 1836 to 1851 he served on the Board of Trustees for East Tennessee College, now the University of Tennessee. He continued his practice of law after moving to Athens, Tennessee in 1837. Jarnagin was an elector for the Whig ticket of William Henry Harrison and John Tyler in the 1840 United States presidential election.

In 1841 he was nominated for U.S. Senator by the Whig caucus in the Tennessee General Assembly. However, some of the Democrats in the legislature decided that no Senator would be preferable to a Whig. Known as the &quot;Immortal Thirteen&quot; by Tennessee Democrats, they refused to allow a quorum on the issue. By the time Jarnagin was eventually elected to the seat and sworn in, over two and half years, almost half of the term, had elapsed. Jarnagin finally assumed office on October 17, 1843 and served until March 3, 1847. During this time, he served as the Chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims. The Whigs nominated him for a second term in 1847, but he was not elected, apparently the Democrats being more amenable to John Bell, another Whig who was eventually elected his successor; a subsequent campaign by Jarnagin for the Tennessee Supreme Court was likewise unsuccessful. Jarnagin moved to Memphis and continued his practice of law there. Jarnagin died from cholera at 1 A.M. on the morning of June 25, 1851 in Memphis. He was interred in that city&#x27;s Elmwood Cemetery.

<text>Theodore William Richards (January 31, 1868 – April 2, 1928) was an American physical chemist and the first American scientist to receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, earning the award &quot;in recognition of his exact determinations of the atomic weights of a large number of the chemical elements.&quot;

== Biography ==

Theodore Richards was born in Germantown, Pennsylvania, to William Trost Richards, a land- and seascape painter, and Anna Matlack Richards, a poet. Richards received most of his pre-college education from his mother. During one summer&#x27;s stay at Newport, Rhode Island, Richards met Professor Josiah Parsons Cooke of Harvard, who showed the young boy Saturn&#x27;s rings through a small telescope. Years later Cooke and Richards would work together in Cooke&#x27;s laboratory.

Beginning in 1878, the Richards family spent two years in Europe, largely in England, where Theodore Richards&#x27; scientific interests grew stronger. After the family&#x27;s return to the United States, he entered Haverford College, Pennsylvania in 1883 at the age of 14, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in 1885. He then enrolled at Harvard University and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1886, as further preparation for graduate studies.

Richards continued on at Harvard, taking as his dissertation topic the determination of the atomic weight of oxygen relative to hydrogen. His doctoral advisor was Josiah Parsons Cooke. Next he performed a year of post-doctoral work in Germany, where he studied under Victor Meyer at the University of Göttingen and others. Richards returned to Harvard as an assistant in chemistry, then instructor, assistant professor, and finally full professor in 1901. He became one of the first American scientists ever offered a full professorship in a major European university, from Göttingen, in 1901, but instead of taking the position, he chose to continue in America. In 1903 he became chairman of the department of chemistry at Harvard, and in 1912 he was appointed Erving Professor of Chemistry and director of the new Wolcott Gibbs Memorial Laboratory.

In 1896, Richards married Miriam Stuart Thayer. The couple had one daughter, Grace Thayer (who married James Bryant Conant), and two sons, Greenough Thayer and William Theodore. Both sons died by suicide.

Richards maintained interests in both art and music. Among his recreations were sketching, golf, and sailing. He died at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on April 2, 1928, at the age of 60. According to one of his descendants, Richards suffered from &quot;chronic respiratory problems and a prolonged depression.&quot;

He was a Quaker.

==Scientific research==

About half of Richards&#x27;s scientific research concerned atomic weights, starting in 1886 with his graduate studies. On returning to Harvard in 1889, this was his first line of research, continuing up to his death. According to Forbes, by 1932 the atomic weights of 55 elements had been studied by Richards and his students. Among the potential sources of error Richards uncovered in such determinations was the tendency of certain salts to occlude gases or foreign solutes on precipitation. As an example of the care Richards used in his work, Emsley reports that he carried out 15,000 recrystallizations of thulium bromate in order to obtain the pure element thulium for an atomic weight measurement.

Richards was the first to show, by chemical analysis, that an element could have different atomic weights. He was asked to analyze samples of naturally occurring lead and lead produced by radioactive decay. His measurements showed that the two samples had different atomic weights, supporting the concepts of isotopes.

Although Richards&#x27;s chemical determinations of atomic weights were highly significant for their time, they have largely been superseded. Modern scientists use electronic instrumentation, such as mass spectrometers, to determine both the masses and the abundances of an element&#x27;s isotopes. From this information, an average atomic mass can be calculated, and compared to the values measured by Richards. The modern methods are faster and more sensitive than those on which Richards had to rely, but not necessarily less expensive.

Other scientific work of Theodore Richards included investigations of the compressibilities of atoms, heats of solution and neutralization, and the electrochemistry of amalgams. His investigation of electrochemical potentials at low temperatures was among the work that led, in the hands of others, to the Nernst heat theorem and the Third law of thermodynamics, although not without heated debate between Nernst and Richards.

Richards also is credited with the invention of the adiabatic calorimeter as well as the nephelometer, which was devised for his work on the atomic weight of strontium.

<doc id="1230745" wikidata="Q1568126" url="?curid=1230745" title="Up from Slavery">
<text>Up from Slavery is the 1901 autobiography of the American educator Booker T. Washington (1856–1915). The book describes his experience of working to rise up from being enslaved as a child during the Civil War, the obstacles he overcame to get an education at the new Hampton Institute, and his work establishing vocational schools like the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama to help Black people and other persecuted people of color learn useful, marketable skills and work to pull themselves, as a race, up by the bootstraps. He reflects on the generosity of teachers and philanthropists who helped educate Black and Native Americans. He describes his efforts to instill manners, breeding, health and dignity into students. His educational philosophy stresses combining academic subjects with learning a trade (reminiscent of John Ruskin). Washington explained that the integration of practical subjects is partly designed to &quot;reassure the White community of the usefulness of educating Black people&quot;.

The book was first published as a serial in 1900 in &quot;The Outlook&quot;, a Christian newspaper of New York. It was serialized so that Washington could receive feedback from his audience during the writing and could adapt his work to his diverse audience.
Washington was a controversial figure during his lifetime, and W. E. B. Du Bois, among others, criticized some of his views. The book was a best-seller, and remained the most popular African-American autobiography until that of Malcolm X. In 1998, the Modern Library listed the book at No. 3 on its list of the 100 best nonfiction books of the 20th century, and in 1999 it was also listed by the conservative &quot;Intercollegiate Review&quot; as one of the &quot;50 Best Books of the Twentieth Century&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
&quot;Up from Slavery&quot; chronicles more than forty years of Washington&#x27;s life: from slave to schoolmaster to the face of southern race relations. In this text, Washington climbs the social ladder through hard, manual labor, a decent education, and relationships with great people. Throughout the text, he stresses the importance of education for the black population as a reasonable tactic to ease race relations in the South (particularly in the context of Reconstruction).

The book is, in essence, Washington&#x27;s traditional, non-confrontational message supported by the example of his life.

== Major themes ==
* Education
* What it means to be your own person 
* Industriousness
* Humility 
* The people&#x27;s capacity for change 
* Poverty among the black population

==Chapter summaries==
=== Chapter 1 ===
&quot;A Slave Among Slaves&quot;: In the first chapter, the reader is given a vivid yet brief sight of the life of slaves, as seen from the author&#x27;s point of view. Basically, it speaks of the hardships the slaves endured before independence and their joys and hassles (arguments) after liberty. The first chapter explains about his suffering in that plantation and the end days of his slavery. The author feels that his life had its beginning in midst of the most miserable surroundings.
He explains about his living conditions, and how his mother works hard to make the days end.

=== Chapter 2 ===
&quot;Boyhood Days&quot;: In the second chapter, the reader learns the importance of naming oneself as a means of reaffirming freedom and the extent to which freed men and women would go to reunite their families. After families had reunited and named themselves, they would then seek out employment (often far from their former masters). The reader learns the story behind the author&#x27;s name: Booker Taliaferro Washington. The second chapter also gives an account of cruel labour of both adults and children in the mines at the city of Malden.
Furthermore, Booker is strongly attracted towards education and oscillates between the extensive schedule of the day&#x27;s work and the school. The second chapter also describes the character of Booker&#x27;s mother and her role in his life.

=== Chapter 3 ===

&quot;The Struggle for Education&quot;: Washington struggles, in this chapter, to earn enough money to reach and remain at Hampton Institute. That was his first experience related to the importance of willingness to do manual labor. The first introduction of General Samuel C. Armstrong

=== Chapter 4 ===
&quot;Helping Others&quot;: Conditions at Hampton are discussed in this chapter, as well as Washington&#x27;s first trip home from school. He returns early from vacation to aid teachers in the cleaning of their classrooms. When Washington returns the next summer, he is elected to teach local students, young and old, through a night school, Sunday school, and private lessons. This chapter also gives the first mention of groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.

=== Chapter 5 ===
&quot;The Reconstruction Period (1867-1878)&quot;: Washington paints an image of the South during Reconstruction Era of the United States, with several assessments of Reconstruction projects including: education, vocational opportunities, and voting rights. He speaks of the Reconstruction policy being built on &quot;a false foundation.&quot; He seeks to play a role in forming a more solid foundation based upon &quot;the hand, head, and heart.&quot;

=== Chapter 6 ===
&quot;Black Race and Red Race&quot;: General Armstrong calls Washington back to Hampton Institute for the purpose of instructing and advising a group of young Native-American men. Washington speaks about different instances of racism against Native Americans and African Americans. Washington also begins a night school at this time.

=== Chapter 7 ===
&quot;Early Days at Tuskegee&quot;: Once again General Armstrong is instrumental in encouraging Washington&#x27;s next project: the establishment of a normal school for African Americans in Tuskegee, Alabama. He describes the conditions in Tuskegee and his work in building the school: &quot;much like making bricks without straw.&quot; Washington also outlines a typical day in the life of an African American living in the country at this time.
In May 1881, General Armstrong told Washington he had received a letter from a man in Alabama to recommend someone to take charge of a &quot;colored school&quot; in Tuskegee. The man writing the letter thought that there was no &quot;colored&quot; person to fill the role and asked him to recommend a white man. The general wrote back to tell him about Washington, and he was accepted for the position.
Washington went there and describes Tuskegee as a town of 2,000 population and as being in the &quot;Black Belt&quot; of the South, where nearly half of the residents were &quot;colored&quot; and in other parts of nearby counties there were six African-American people to one white person. He explains that he thinks the term &quot;Black Belt&quot; originated from the rich, dark soil of the area, which was also the part of the South where slaves were most profitable.
Once at Tuskegee, his first task was to find a place to open the school and secured a rundown &quot;shanty&quot; and African-American Methodist church. He also travelled around the area and acquainted himself with the local people. He describes some of the families he met and who worked in the cotton fields. He saw that most of the farmers were in debt and schools were generally taught in churches or log cabins and these had few or no provisions. Some, for example, had no means of heating in the winter and one school had one book to share between five children. 
He goes on to relate the story of a man aged around 60. He told Washington he had been sold in 1845 and there had been five of them: &quot;There were five of us; myself and brother and three mules.&quot; Washington explains he is referring to these experiences to highlight how improvements were later made.

=== Chapter 8 ===
&quot;Teaching School in a Stable and a Hen-house&quot;: Washington details the necessity of a new form of education for the children of Tuskegee, for the typical New England education would not be sufficient to effect uplift. Here is also the introduction of long-time partners, George W. Campbell and Lewis Adams, and future wife, Olivia A. Davidson; these individuals felt similarly to Washington in that mere book-learning would not be enough. The goal was established to prepare students of Tuskegee to become teachers, farmers, and overall moral people.
Washington&#x27;s first days at Tuskegee are described in this chapter, as is his method of working. He demonstrates a holistic approach to his teaching in that he researched the area and the people and how poverty stricken many were. His visits also showed how education was both a premium and underfunded, and therefore justifies the setting up of this new facility.
Tuskegee is also seen to be set in a rural area, where agriculture was the main form of employment, and so the institute&#x27;s later incarnation as an industrial school that was fit for teaching its students skills for the locale is justified.
He encountered difficulties in setting up the school, which he opened on July 4, 1881, and this included some opposition from white people who questioned the value of educating African Americans: &quot;These people feared the result of education would be that the Negros would leave the farms, and that it would be difficult to secure them for domestic service.&quot;
He describes how he has depended on the advice of two men in particular and these were the ones who wrote to General Armstrong asking for a teacher. One is a white man and a former slave holder called George W. Campbell. The other is a &quot;black&quot; man and a former slave called Lewis Adams.
When the school opened they had 30 students and these were divided roughly equally between the sexes. Many more had wanted to come, but it had been decided that they must be over 15 and have had some education already. Many who came were public school teachers and some were around 40 years of age. The number of pupils increased each week and there were nearly 50 by the end of the first month.

A co-teacher came at the end of the first six weeks. This was Olivia A. Davidson and she later became his wife. She had been taught in Ohio and came South as she had heard of the need for teachers. She is described as brave in the way she nursed the sick when others would not (such as caring for a boy with smallpox). She also trained further at Hampton and then at Massachusetts State Normal School at Framingham.

She and Washington agreed that the students needed more than a &quot;book education&quot; and they thought they must show them how to care for their bodies and how to earn a living after they had left the school. They tried to educate them in a way that would make them want to stay in these agricultural districts (rather than leave for the city and be forced to live by their wits). Many of the students came initially to study so that they would not have to work with their hands, whereas Washington aimed for them to be capable of all sorts of labor and to not be ashamed of it.

=== Chapter 9 ===
&quot;Anxious Days and Sleepless Nights&quot;: This chapter starts by stating how the people spent Christmas drinking and having a merry time, and not bearing in mind the true essence of Christmas. This chapter also discusses the institute&#x27;s relationship with the locals of Tuskegee, the purchase and cultivation of a new farm, the erection of a new building, and the introduction of several generous donors, mostly northern. The death of Washington&#x27;s first wife, Fannie N. Smith, is announced in this chapter. He had a daughter named Portia.

=== Chapter 10 ===
&quot;A Harder Task Than Making Bricks Without Straw&quot;: In this chapter, Washington discusses the importance of having the students erect their own buildings: &quot;Not a few times, when a new student has been led into the temptation of marring the looks of some building by lead pencil marks or by the cuts of a jack-knife, I have heard an old student remind him: &#x27;Don&#x27;t do that. That is our building. I helped put it up.&#x27;&quot; The bricks reference in the title refers to the difficulty of forming bricks without some very necessary tools: money and experience. Through much labour, the students were able to produce fine bricks; their confidence then spilled over into other efforts, such as the building of vehicles.

=== Chapter 12 ===
&quot;Raising Money&quot;: Washington travels north to secure additional funding for the institute with which he had much success. Two years after a meeting with one man, the Institute received a cheque of $10,000 and, from another couple, a gift of $50,000. Washington felt great pressure for his school and students to succeed, for failure would reflect poorly on the ability of the race. It is this time period Washington begins working with Andrew Carnegie, proving to Carnegie that this school was worthy of support. Not only did Washington find large donations helpful, but small loans were key which paid the bills and gave evidence to the community&#x27;s faith in this type of education.

=== Chapter 13 ===
&quot;Two Thousand Miles for a Five-Minute Speech&quot;: Washington marries again. His new wife is Olivia A. Davidson, first mentioned in Chapter 8. This chapter begins Washington&#x27;s public speaking career; first at the National Education Association. His next goal was to speak before a Southern white audience. His first opportunity was limited by prior engagements and travel time, leaving him only five minutes to give his speech. Subsequent speeches were filled with purpose: when in the North he would be actively seeking funds, when in the South encouraged &quot;the material and intellectual growth of both races.&quot; The result of one speech was the Atlanta Exposition Speech.

=== Chapter 14 ===
&quot;The Atlanta Exposition Address&quot;: The speech that Washington gave to the Atlanta Exposition is printed here in its entirety. He also gives some explanation of the reaction to his speech: first, delight from all, then, slowly, a feeling among African Americans that Washington had not been strong enough in regards to the &#x27;rights&#x27; of the race. In time, however, the African-American public would become, once again, generally pleased with Washington&#x27;s goals and methods for African-American uplift.

Washington also speaks about the African-American clergy. He also makes a much disputed statement about voting: &quot;I believe it is the duty of the Negro – as the greater part of the race is already doing – to deport himself modestly in regard to political claims, depending upon the slow but sure influences that proceed from the possession of property, intelligence, and high character for the full recognition of his political rights. I think that the according of the full exercise of political rights is going to be a matter of natural, slow growth, not an over-night, gourd-vine affair. I do not believe that the Negro should cease voting…but I do believe that in his voting he should more and more be influenced by those of intelligence and character who are his next-door neighbors…I do not believe that any state should make a law that permits an ignorant and poverty-stricken white man to vote, and prevents a black man in the same condition from voting. Such a law is not only unjust, but it will react, as all unjust laws do, in time; for the effect of such a law is to encourage the Negro to secure education and property. I believe that in time, through the operation of intelligence and friendly race relations, all cheating at the ballot box in the South will cease.&quot;

=== Chapter 15 ===
&quot;The Secret of Success in Public Speaking&quot;: Washington speaks again of the reception of his Atlanta Exposition Speech. He then goes on to give the reader some advice about public speaking and describes several memorable speeches.

=== Chapter 16 ===
&quot;Europe&quot;: The author is married a third time, to Margaret James Murray. He speaks about his children. At this time, he and his wife are offered the opportunity to travel to Europe. Mixed emotions influenced their decision to go: Washington had always dreamed of traveling to Europe, but he feared the reaction of the people, for so many times had he seen individuals of his race achieve success and then turned away from the people. Mr. and Mrs. Washington enjoyed their trip, especially upon seeing their friend, Henry Tanner, an African-American artist, being praised by all classes. During their time abroad, the couple was also able to take tea with both Queen Victoria and Susan B. Anthony. Upon arriving back in the United States, Washington was asked to visit Charleston, West Virginia, near his former home in Malden.

===Chapter 17===
&quot;Last Words&quot;: Washington describes his last interactions with General Armstrong and his first with Armstrong&#x27;s successor, Rev. Dr. Hollis B. Frissell. The greatest surprise of his life was being invited to receive an honorary degree from Harvard University, the first awarded to an African American. Another great honor for Washington and Tuskegee was the visit of President William McKinley to the institute, an act which McKinley hoped to impress upon citizens his &quot;interest and faith in the race.&quot; Washington then describes the conditions at Tuskegee Institute and his resounding hope for the future of the race.

== Context ==

The America of the 1880s and 1890s was one of white hostility toward African Americans. There was also the belief that the African-American race would not have been able to survive without the institution of slavery. Popular culture played in to the ideas of &quot;black criminality and moral decline&quot; as can be seen in the characters Jim_Crow_(character) and Zip Coon. When Washington began his writing and public speaking, he was fighting the notion that African Americans were inherently stupid and incapable of civilization. Washington&#x27;s primary goal was to impress upon the audience the possibility of progress. Furthermore, living in the Black Belt, Booker T. Washington was vulnerable to mob violence and was, therefore, always mindful not to provoke the mob. As would be expected for a man in such precarious position, when violence erupted, he tried to stem his talk of equality and progress so as not to exacerbate the situation.

Lynching in the South at this time was prevalent as mobs of whites would take the law into their own hands and would torture and murder of dozens of men and women, including white men. The offenses of the victims included: &quot;for being victor over a white man in a fight;&quot; &quot;protecting fugitive from posse;&quot; &quot;stealing seventy-five cents;&quot; &quot;expressing sympathy for mob&#x27;s victim;&quot; &quot;for being father of boy who jostled white women.&quot; It is clear that any white person to show sympathy or offer protection for African-American victims would be labeled complicit himself and become vulnerable to violence by the mob. In 1901, Reverend Quincy Ewing of Mississippi charged the press and pulpit with uniting public sentiment against lynching. Lynching would continue into the 1950s and 1960s.

Some blame Washington&#x27;s comparatively sheepish message upon a lack of desire for true African-American uplift. Some, taking into account the environment in which he was delivering his message, support Washington for making any public stance at all.

== The relationship between Washington and his critics ==
Since its publication, according to biographer Louis Harlan, &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; has been read as painting Booker T. Washington as both an &quot;accommodationist and calculating realist seeking to carve out a viable strategy for black struggle amidst the nadir of race relations in the United States.&quot; While more contemporary ideas of black civil rights call for a more provocative approach, Washington was certainly a major figure in his time. Most critiques of him target his accommodationism, yet his private life was very much aimed at opposition through funding. The Atlanta Exposition speech shows his dual nature, giving everyone present something to agree with, no matter their intention. Washington deserves praise, in the view of historian Fitzhugh Brundage, for &quot;seeking to be all things to all men in a multifaceted society.&quot; Many do argue against his being characterized as an accommodationist. For example, biographer Robert Norrell has written, &quot;He worked too hard to resist and to overcome white supremacy to call him an accommodationist, even if some of his white-supremacist southern neighbors so construed some of his statements. Having conditions forced on him, with threat of destruction clearly the cost of resistance, does not constitute a fair definition of accommodation.&quot; Historians are thoroughly split over this characterization.

W. E. B. DuBois initially applauded Washington&#x27;s stance on racial uplift. At one point he went as far as to say of the Atlanta Exposition speech: &quot;here might be a real basis for the settlement between whites and blacks in the South.&quot; DuBois, in his book &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot;, congratulates Washington for accomplishing his first task, which was to earn the ear of the white southern population through a spirit of sympathy and cooperation. He also acknowledges the unstable situation in the south and the necessity for sensitivity to community feelings, yet he believes that Washington has failed in his sensitivity to African Americans. DuBois asserts that there are many educated and successful African Americans who would criticize the work of Washington, but they are being hushed in such a way as to impede &quot;democracy and the safeguard of modern society.&quot; This is where their paths would diverge: Washington with his &quot;Tuskegee Machine&quot; and DuBois with the &quot;Niagara Movement.&quot;

In 1905, the Niagara Movement issued a statement enumerating their demands against oppression and for civil rights. The Movement established itself as an entity entirely removed from Washington in conciliation, but rather a new, more radical course of action: &quot;Through helplessness we may submit, but the voice of protest of ten million Americans must never cease to assail the ears of their fellows, so long as America is unjust.&quot; For a time, the Movement grew very successfully, but they lost their effectiveness when chapters began to disagree with one another. Eventually, the Movement&#x27;s efforts translated into the development of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

Of course there were other participants in this discussion of the future of the African-American race, including that of W. H. Thomas, another African-American man. Thomas believed that African Americans were &quot;deplorably bad&quot; and that it would require a &quot;miracle&quot; to make any sort of progress. As in the case of Washington and DuBois, Washington and Thomas have areas of agreement, though DuBois would not so agree: that the best chance for an African American was in the areas of farming and country life. In some respects, it is hard to compare the two as each has different intentions.

Similarly, Thomas Dixon, author of &quot;The Clansman&quot; (1905), began a newspaper controversy with Washington over the industrial system, most likely to encourage talk of his upcoming book. He characterized the newfound independence of Tuskegee graduates as inciting competition: &quot;Competition is war…. What will the [southern white man] do when put to the test? He will do exactly what his white neighbor in the North does when the Negro threatens his bread—kill him!&quot;

==In popular culture==
In September 2011, a seven-part documentary television and DVD series was produced by LionHeart FilmWorks and director Kevin Hershberger using the title &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;. The 315-minute series is distributed by Mill Creek Entertainment. This series is not directly about the Booker T. Washington autobiography &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;, but tells the story of Black Slavery in America from the first arrival of African slaves at Jamestown in 1619 to the Civil War and the ratification of the 15th Amendment in 1870, which prohibits the government from denying a citizen the vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude (i.e., slavery), the third of the Reconstruction Amendments which finally ended the legitimacy of slavery in the United States.

<doc id="1230747" wikidata="Q7807754" url="?curid=1230747" title="Tin Hat">
<text>Tin Hat (formerly the Tin Hat Trio) is an acoustic chamber music group currently based in San Francisco, California. Their music combines many genres of music, including jazz, southern blues, bluegrass, neoclassical, eastern European folk music, and avant-garde.

Since its formation in 1997, the original Tin Hat Trio has often expanded its trio format by inviting other musicians to join them. All of their CDs feature guests, among them Tom Waits, Mike Patton and Willie Nelson, as well as friends like clarinetist Ben Goldberg and harpist Zeena Parkins. Parkins appears on 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Rodeo Eroded&quot; and 2004&#x27;s &quot;Book of Silk&quot; and has performed live with the trio as the resident sound effects artist in their live music/silent film projects. Goldberg has been a frequent guest of Tin Hat Trio and contributed to both &quot;Memory Is an Elephant&quot; and &quot;The Rodeo Eroded&quot;.

When founding member Rob Burger (the trio&#x27;s accordionist and pianist) left the trio in late 2004, Mark Orton and Carla Kihlstedt replaced him with both Goldberg and Parkins, presenting a new, though closely related, ensemble—the Tin Hat Quartet—for two short concert tours in the U.S. in January and April 2005. While on tour, they invited another musician to come under their hat, San Francisco&#x27;s Ara Anderson—known as one of Tom Waits&#x27; favorite sidemen in recent years. Like the departed Burger, Anderson plays myriad keyed instruments as well as trumpet and glockenspiel, thus adding new colors and strokes to the already large canvas of Tin Hat&#x27;s sound.

In 2005 Tin Hat Trio&#x27;s song &quot;Fear of the South&quot; was featured on the &quot;Everything Is Illuminated&quot; soundtrack.

In 2013 the film score to &quot;Nebraska&quot; was composed by Tin Hat member Mark Orton. The score also includes performances by other members of Tin Hat, providing the first time the three original members have reunited since 2005. A soundtrack album was released on November 19, 2013, by Milan Records.

<text>Ripley Under Ground is a psychological thriller by Patricia Highsmith, the second novel in her &quot;Ripliad&quot; series. It was published in June 1970.

== Plot summary ==
Six years after the events of &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, Tom Ripley is now in his early thirties and living a comfortable life in France with his wife, heiress Héloïse Plisson. The lifestyle at his estate, Belle Ombre, is supported by Dickie Greenleaf&#x27;s fortune, occasional fence work with an American named Reeves Minot and Derwatt Ltd. — an art forgery scheme that Ripley helped set up years before as a silent partner. 

Years prior, after the painter Philip Derwatt disappeared and committed suicide in Greece, his friends — photographer Jeff Constant and freelance journalist Ed Banbury — began to publicize his work and sold a number of authentic paintings. Thanks to their efforts, Derwatt became more famous and his paintings more valuable. When the original Derwatts began to run out, Ripley went into business with them and persuaded Bernard Tufts, another painter, to produce forged Derwatts. The money is rolling in, but Tufts, who had idolized Derwatt, is plagued by guilt for his role in the scheme.

Derwatt Ltd. is threatened by a disgruntled American collector, Thomas Murchison, who surmises that one of his Derwatts is a forgery. Worried that the lid is about to be blown on the whole scheme, Ripley decides to go to London and impersonate Derwatt, meet with Murchison and convince him that the paintings are genuine. Ripley is unsuccessful, however, particularly as Tufts meets with Murchison and tells him not to buy any more Derwatts. Ripley, as himself, invites Murchison to Belle Ombre to inspect his own Derwatt painting (also a fake) to try to dissuade him from taking the case to a Tate Gallery curator and the police.

Murchison inspects Ripley&#x27;s painting and believes it is also a fake. Realizing that the argument is futile, Ripley comes clean on the entire scam, asking for mercy for Tufts&#x27; sake. Murchison refuses, however, so Ripley kills him. He abandons Murchison&#x27;s suitcase and painting at Orly Airport, then buries his body in the woods near Belle Ombre. Later, Dickie&#x27;s cousin Chris comes to stay while on a European tour. He notices the fresh grave outside the house. Tufts also visits Ripley, saying he wants to confess everything to the police. Ripley tells Tufts that he killed Murchison and, realizing his own terrible choice of a gravesite, asks him to help move the body. Together, they dump the corpse in a river.

The French police, together with Inspector Webster from Metropolitan Police, investigate Murchison&#x27;s disappearance, making trips to Belle Ombre and inspecting the property. Tufts leaves a hanging effigy in the cellar that is discovered by Héloïse, along with a note suggesting that he is going to confess. When he returns to Belle Ombre, Tufts unsuccessfully tries to strangle Ripley, who feels pity for the disturbed man and does not retaliate. Later, Tufts knocks Ripley out with a shovel and buries him alive in Murchison&#x27;s empty grave. Ripley manages to escape and returns to London to impersonate Derwatt for a second appearance, this time for Webster and Murchison&#x27;s wife. Mrs. Murchison decides to pay a visit to Belle Ombre, the last place her husband was seen.

After Mrs. Murchison&#x27;s visit, Ripley realizes that Tufts is contemplating suicide. Feeling responsible, he searches for him in Greece, Paris and finally Salzburg. When he approaches Tufts, the painter believes Ripley is a ghost. Tufts runs from Ripley and leaps off a cliff to his death. Ripley partially cremates and buries the body. He tells Webster that Derwatt committed suicide and Tufts disappeared in Salzburg, presumably to follow suit. He gives Webster some of Tuft’s remainswhich he claims are Derwatt’sand agrees to accompany him to Salzburg to show him where the rest of his body is buried. The novel ends with Ripley steeling himself for another performance with Webster and the Austrian police.

==Reception==
In the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Allen J. Hubin wrote that Highsmith&#x27;s &quot;portrayal of the police of two nations as louts eager to be flummoxed by her non‐hero&#x27;s transparent machinations leaves me blank with incredulity.&quot;

Ian Hamilton felt the title character possessed &quot;the relaxed panache of a contented psychopath as if Ripley&#x27;s real inheritance from Dickie Greenleaf was not normality but the confidence to nourish and exercise abnormality&quot;.

H. R. F. Keating points to Tom&#x27;s murder of Murchison as emblematic of situational ethics. One scholar calls Tom Ripley a &quot;moral Typhoid Mary...a malignant influence on anyone sucked into his orbit...&quot; Amid a broader discussion of Ripley as Highsmith&#x27;s &quot;sinthome&quot;, Fiona Peters points to the murder of Murchison as most emblematic of the villain&#x27;s ethos. Ripley is desperate to make Murchison understand his worldview, but when he cannot, Ripley feels forced to kill him.

According to Michael Dirda, &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot; considers authenticity, and the difference between appearance and reality. As Ripley admires a pair of Derwatt paintings on his walls, he actually comes to prefer the forgery over the genuine artwork. Dirda notes, &quot;Fakery, though, suffuses every page of &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot;. Tom pretends to be Derwatt. Murchison appears to catch a plane at Orly. An effigy of Bernard is found hanging by its neck. A supposedly dead man rises from his grave. Bernard is haunted by what seems a ghost. In this counterfeit world only the pragmatic Tom thrives, for he alone recognizes that there is no distinction that matters between what is real and what is only apparently real.&quot;

<text>Manchester&#x27;s music scene produced successful bands in the 1960s including the Hollies, the Bee Gees and Herman&#x27;s Hermits. After the punk rock era, Manchester produced popular bands including Joy Division, New Order, the Smiths and Simply Red. In the late 1980s, the ecstasy-fuelled dance club scene played a part in the rise of Madchester with bands like the Stone Roses, Inspiral Carpets and Happy Mondays. In the 1990s, Manchester saw the rise of Britpop bands, notably Oasis.

==History==
===Pop groups of the 1960s and early 1970s===
Manchester and its surrounding area had an impressive music scene before 1976, with groups in the 1960s including the Hollies, the Bee Gees, Herman&#x27;s Hermits, Wayne Fontana and The Mindbenders, and Freddie and the Dreamers. Barclay James Harvest formed in nearby Oldham in 1966 and 10cc in Stockport in the early 1970s. &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; was also recorded by the BBC at this time in the city.

Manchester bands Freddie and the Dreamers, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders and Herman&#x27;s Hermits topped the American Billboard charts consecutively during mid-April – May 1965. In 1965, all three bands were numbers 1, 2 and 3 on the US Billboard top 100 for one week. Graham Nash of the Hollies moved to California to become part of the rapidly expanding music scene there. With the exception of Graham Gouldman of 10cc and Eric Stewart of the Mindbenders (who built Strawberry Studios in Stockport, the UK&#x27;s first world class recording studio outside London), and Keith Hopwood of Herman&#x27;s Hermits whose Pluto Studios started in the same building as Strawberry, then spent 1977–1987 in the centre of Manchester there was little reinvestment in Manchester from its local musicians who had been successful.

Philomena Lynott (1930-2019), the Irish mother of Thin Lizzy frontman Phil Lynott, ran the Clifton Grange Hotel (on the corner of Wellington Road and Alness Road) in Whalley Range from 1966 to 1980. On visits to Manchester, Phil Lynott would stay with her there, and took inspiration from the colourful &#x27;showbiz&#x27; clientele he met who frequented the hotel. The Thin Lizzy songs &quot;Clifton Grange Hotel&quot;, &quot;Johnny The Fox Meets Jimmy The Weed&quot; and &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; were inspired by characters and events in the hotel during the period.

===The Sex Pistols at the Free Trade Hall and punk rock===
On 4 June 1976, at the invitation of Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley of Buzzcocks, the Sex Pistols played at the Lesser Free Trade Hall. In an audience of fewer than 42 people, several key members of Manchester&#x27;s future music scene were present: Tony Wilson (Granada Television presenter and creator of Factory Records), Peter Hook, Bernard Sumner (Joy Division and New Order), Morrissey (later to form the Smiths with Johnny Marr), producer Martin Hannett, Mark E Smith of the Fall, Paul Morley later to become an influential music journalist and Mick Hucknall of Simply Red. Another influential event was the release of Buzzcocks&#x27; &quot;Spiral Scratch&quot; EP in early 1977 – the first independent-label punk record.

In the wake of the Buzzcocks&#x27; release, the old movers and shakers from the Manchester music collective Music Force, who included producer Martin Hannett, Tosh Ryan and Lawrence Beadle, formed a local label called Rabid Records and started putting out singles by local acts like Slaughter &amp; the Dogs (Rob Gretton later to manage Joy Division and New Order was their roadie/tour manager – all Wythenshawe lads), John Cooper Clarke and Ed Banger &amp; the Nosebleeds (whose lineup included Vini Reilly) and they licensed &quot;Jilted John&quot; by Jilted John to EMI records.

The timing of this record company coincided with Tony Wilson bringing the cream of both American and British punk and New Wave bands to the public on his acclaimed late night Granada Television show &quot;So It Goes&quot;. This meant that Manchester had televised the Sex Pistols long before they appeared on Thames Television with Bill Grundy (incidentally another Mancunian). Unlike other major cities, Manchester hosted The Sex Pistols Anarchy Tour twice at The Electric Circus; and it was these gigs more than the small Lesser Free Trade Hall gigs which really lit a fire under Manchester&#x27;s assorted musicians and gave them that &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; philosophy which defined British punk.

When &quot;So It Goes&quot; concluded on Granada TV, Tony Wilson wanted to remain involved in the local music scene, so he started an event night at the old Russell Club in Hulme called The Factory along with his friends (soon to be business partners) Alan Erasmus and Alan Wise. Deeply Vale Festivals (1976–1979), just north of Manchester between Rochdale and Bury, was the first free festival in the country to introduce punk bands such as Durutti Column, Fast Cars, the Fall and the Drones. The festival was compered by Tony Wilson as a favour to friend and organiser Chris Hewitt. Wilson had been taking a great interest in Rabid Records and its set up.

After working on the research for a Granada TV feature about Rabid, he along with Alan Erasmus and Joy Division Manager Rob Gretton (the &quot;Ideal for Living&quot; EP had been distributed by Rabid) decided they would do their own version of Rabid Records, but instead of churning out singles and then licensing the album deals to major labels (Slaughter &amp; the Dogs&#x27; debut appeared on Decca, John Cooper Clarke was licensed to CBS, and Jilted John to EMI), they would concentrate on albums. The first album following the Factory sampler EP (which included Joy Division, Cabaret Voltaire, and Od) was &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; by Joy Division, recorded at Strawberry Studios in Stockport.

===Factory Records and the post-punk period===
Taking the Industrial Revolution as its model, Factory Records played upon Manchester&#x27;s traditions, invoking at once apparently incongruous images of the industrial north and the glamorous pop art world of Andy Warhol. While label mates A Certain Ratio and the Durutti Column each forged their own sound, it was Factory&#x27;s Joy Division who were the most prominent. Other bands that walked through the door opened by punk included the Salford Jets, fronted by Mike Sweeney, and the Freshies, led by Chris Sievey (Frank Sidebottom). There was also the idiosyncratic post-punk of the Membranes

At the same time, and out of the same post-punk of Joy Division combining rock, pop, and dance music to earn much critical acclaim while selling millions of records. The group that would ultimately become the definitive Manchester group of the 1980s was the Smiths, led by Morrissey and Marr. With songs like &quot;Rusholme Ruffians&quot; and &quot;Suffer Little Children&quot;, Morrissey sang explicitly about Manchester.

===Madchester===

As the 1980s drew to a close, a new energy arrived in Manchester fueled by the drug ecstasy. A new scene developed around The Haçienda night club (part of the Factory Records empire), creating what would become known as the Madchester scene, the main proponents being Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, Northside, and the Stone Roses alongside the already legendary Hacienda co-owners New Order and Cheshire band the Charlatans. The history of the Manchester music scene over this period was dramatised in Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; and the life of Joy Division&#x27;s Ian Curtis was also dramatised in the 2007 film &quot;Control&quot;.

===1990s and after===
Following the Madchester period, Manchester music lost much of its provincial energy, though many successful and interesting acts were still to emerge.

Morrissey, New Order, the Fall, James, and the Verve still continue to garner critical acclaim while Oasis remains the most popular, having played to more than 1.7 million people worldwide during their Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth tour of 2005 and early 2006. In 2010, Manchester was named the UK&#x27;s seventh &quot;most musical&quot; city by PRS for Music per head to some bemusement.

==Venues of the early 21st century==
Manchester&#x27;s biggest popular music venue is the Manchester Arena, which seats over twenty thousand one of the largest arena of its type in Europe (largest being Paris La Défense Arena with forty thousand seats), with the Etihad Stadium and Old Trafford&#x27;s cricket grounds also providing large ad hoc open air venues outside of the sporting season. Other major venues include the Manchester Apollo, Manchester Central (formerly, and informally, known as the GMEX) and the Manchester Academy. There are over 30 smaller venues for signed and unsigned artists of all genres to perform in, ensuring that the music scene in Manchester constantly remains vibrant and interesting. Manchester is also home to Victoria Warehouse, one of the biggest electronic music venues in the country. Victoria Warehouse has been the stage to artists like Hardwell and Steve Aoki, as well as holding the BBC 6 Music Festival in 2014 and Warehouse Project in 2013.

An area known as the Northern Quarter, considered the cultural and musical heart of the city, houses some of the best known of these venues such as Band on the Wall, the Roadhouse and The Night and Day Cafe. Various other venues exist in pubs and clubs throughout the city.

In 2018, Manchester was named the UK&#x27;s rock and indie capital, largely due to the high number of gigs hosted by the city&#x27;s small and medium-sized venues. Research found that Manchester Academy had hosted the most rock and indie events in Manchester since its records began in 2015 – and the 5th most in the UK.

==Broadcast media==
Granada TV, the BBC on Oxford Road and Key 103 have all played prominent roles in supporting and expanding various parts of the music scene in Manchester. Terry Christian on Key 103 weekday evenings throughout 1988/89 championed the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, James, Inspiral Carpets, Yargo, and many others, pushing the local Manchester scene into the mainstream in Greater Manchester. The region is now served well by its own local radio shows, most notably via some regular weekly slots on BBC Radio GMR. London based commercial station Xfm Manchester in Manchester has also established itself, delivering a strictly indie diet to the populace and offering regular and effective exposure to local unsigned acts.

<text>Lawrence Frederick Kert (December 5, 1930 – June 5, 1991) was an American actor, singer, and dancer. He is best known for his role of Tony in the original Broadway production of the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;. He was nominated for a Tony Award (1971) for his work in the musical comedy &quot;Company&quot; (1970).

==Early life==

Kert was born in Los Angeles, the youngest of four children of Orthodox Jewish parents, Harry and Lillian (née Pearson; originally Peretz) Kert (some sources cite the family surname as Kurt). Kert&#x27;s eldest sibling, Anita, became a vocalist, noted for dubbing Rita Hayworth and other non-singing stars in their films. He and his siblings graduated from Hollywood High School. A Shubert Theater &quot;Playbill&quot; for 1963&#x27;s &quot;I Can Get It For You Wholesale&quot;, starring Kert states: &quot;He attended Los Angeles City College. As a teenager he worked at breaking wild horses to saddle—which led to a teen-age career as a stunt man, stand-in, and extra in well-nigh 100 films&quot;.

Kert&#x27;s first professional credit was as a member of a theatrical troupe called the &quot;Bill Norvas and the Upstarts&quot; in the 1950 Broadway revue &quot;Tickets, Please!&quot;. After a seven-month run, he worked sporadically in Broadway, Off-Broadway and ballet productions as a dancer until 1957, when he was cast in &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

==&quot;West Side Story&quot;==
In 1955, while dancing in the chorus in the Sammy Davis Jr. show &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;, Kert was recommended by his fellow dancer and friend Chita Rivera, who eventually won the role of Anita in &quot;West Side Story&quot;, to audition as a dancer for &quot;Gangway&quot; during the earliest Broadway pre-production of the Arthur Laurents-Leonard Bernstein-Stephen Sondheim musical later titled &quot;West Side Story&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; set on the west side of mid-town Manhattan in the 1950s. Kert was the 18th out of 150 hopefuls to audition, but was the first one to be cut. A few months later, while he was working for &quot;Esquire&quot; in an advertising show, Stephen Sondheim approached him after seeing him perform and set up an audition for the part of Tony. Kert was reluctant to accept the offer, but a few weeks later, he was informed that he had the role.

According to Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book for &quot;West Side Story&quot;, Kert was &quot;a California extrovert, laughing, bubbling, deadly funny, and openly gay.&quot; Director-choreographer Jerome Robbins frequently clashed with Kert, publicly chastising him for being a &quot;faggot&quot;, despite the fact that Robbins himself, fellow dancer Tommy Abbott, and most of the creative team were gay. Kert did not repeat his role in the 1961 film version of the show because at 30 years old he could not have believably played a teenager. The role went to former child actor Richard Beymer, whose vocals were dubbed by Jimmy Bryant. Kert was upset at being passed over for the role, because he had hoped that it would jump-start his film career.

==Success and struggles==
Kert&#x27;s later career had only occasional high points. The Broadway musical &quot;A Family Affair&quot; limped along for three months in early 1962. He was a member of the cast of the infamous ill-fated musical version of Truman Capote&#x27;s novella, &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, which closed during previews in December 1966. His next project, &quot;La Strada&quot; (1969), starring Bernadette Peters, closed on opening night. He often worked in Off-Broadway, theatre workshops, and taught dance. However, replacing the original actor who fell ill, he played the male lead Cliff in the first run of &quot;Cabaret&quot; for most of its run.

His next big break came as a replacement for Dean Jones as the lead in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Company&quot; (1970). Soon after opening night, director Harold Prince released Jones from his contract and substituted Kert. The Tony Awards nominating committee allowed him to compete in the category of Best Actor in a Musical, though the rules normally restricted nominations to the performer who originated a role. The original cast album of &quot;Company&quot; had already been recorded before Kert joined the first cast. When the cast traveled to London to reprise their roles, Columbia Records recorded new tracks with Kert to substitute for those Jones had recorded. This recording with Kert was released as the Original London Cast recording. In 1998, when Sony Music, which had acquired the Columbia catalog, released a new digital version of the original Broadway cast recording, Kert&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Being Alive&quot;, the show&#x27;s final number, was included as a bonus track.

In 1977, he won the role of Liza Minnelli&#x27;s leading man in &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, a movie within the movie &quot;New York, New York&quot;. Kert hoped that his role as the producer, though small, would be his great movie breakthrough. But before &quot;New York, New York&quot; opened, United Artists, the distributor, insisted that it was too long and persuaded director Martin Scorsese to drop most of the 11-minute &quot;Happy Endings&quot; sequence from the final version, including all of Kert&#x27;s scenes. In 1981, &quot;New York, New York&quot; was re-released with &quot;Happy Endings&quot; intact and Kert&#x27;s role restored.

In 1975, he appeared in &quot;A Musical Jubilee&quot;, a revue that lasted barely three months. &quot;Rags&quot; (1986) closed two days after it opened. In his final show, &quot;Legs Diamond&quot; (1988), he was a standby for star Peter Allen. One of Kert&#x27;s last recordings was the 1987 2-CD studio cast album of the complete scores of two George and Ira Gershwin musicals: &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; and its sequel &quot;Let &#x27;Em Eat Cake&quot;. This was the first time these scores had been recorded in their entirety.

Kert made brief appearances in the feature films &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1953) and &quot;New York, New York&quot; (1977). His television credits included guest appearances on &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice (Alfred Hitchcock Presents)&quot;, &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;, &quot;Combat!&quot; (Season 4 episode &quot;One At A Time&quot;, aired 1966), &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Kojak: Conspiracy of Fear (1973)&quot;, and &quot;Love, American Style&quot;. He also appeared several times on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. In (1988) Kert appeared for a Special Tribute to Broadway command performance at Ronald Reagan’s White House,
performing “Maria”, “Tonite” and “Something’s Coming” accompanied by Marvin Hamlisch.

==Death==
Kert&#x27;s last stage appearance came in a touring company of &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; but he missed performances because of illness. Kert died, at 60, in his Manhattan home of AIDS in 1991. Kert&#x27;s longtime partner at the time of his death was Ron Pullen, though this did not become publicly known until after he died.

<text>Sam Cobean (December 28, 1913 in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania – July 2, 1951 in Schuyler County, New York) was a cartoonist, especially known for his work in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in the 1940s and 1950s.

His book of cartoons, &quot;The Naked Eye&quot;, has been published around the world. Likewise, the book published after his death, &quot;The Cartoons of Cobean&quot; has enjoyed worldwide popularity since its publication in 1952. He was killed driving his Jaguar when he rear-ended another vehicle. His passenger Cameron Argetsinger, founder of Watkins Glen racing, was injured.

<text>Roger Wood Wilkins (January 29, 1932 – March 26, 2017) was an American lawyer, civil rights leader, professor of history, and journalist who served as the 15th United States Assistant Attorney General under President Lyndon B. Johnson from 1966 to 1969.

A member of the Democratic Party, Wilkins was mentored by Supreme Court of the United States Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall early in his career. Throughout the 1960s, Wilkins campaigned for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Wilkins to be the administration&#x27;s chief troubleshooter on urban racial issues; he later became assistant attorney general in the Johnson administration.

Wilkins&#x27; uncle, Roy Wilkins, was the former executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1964 to 1977.

==Biography==
Wilkins was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on January 29, 1932, and grew up in Michigan. He was educated at Crispus Attucks Elementary School in Kansas City and Central High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Wilkins received his A.B. degree in 1953 and J.D. degree in 1956, both from the University of Michigan, where he interned with the NAACP and was a member of the senior leadership society, Michigamua.

===Career===
Wilkins worked as a welfare lawyer in Ohio before becoming an Assistant Attorney General in President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s administration at age 33; in this capacity, he was one of the highest-ranking Black Americans ever to serve in the executive branch up to that time.

Roger Wilkins was sworn in as Director of the federal Community Relations Service on Friday, February 4, 1966, in a ceremony at The White House.

Leaving government in 1969 at the end of the Johnson administration, he worked briefly for the Ford Foundation before joining the opinion section of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as an editorial board member. Alongside additional news reports by Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein and E.J. Bachinski and editorial cartoons by Herblock, print editorials by Wilkins and Philip L. Geyelin were included as supplemental items in the publication&#x27;s 1973 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service-winning entry on the incipient Watergate scandal, reifying its importance in the popular consciousness and ultimately precipitating President Richard Nixon&#x27;s resignation from office. 

He left &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1974 to work for &quot;The New York Times&quot; as an editorial board member and opinion columnist. In 1977, he joined other journalists of color in a lawsuit alleging that the newspaper employed racial discrimination in hiring and promotions. Although the litigation resulted in a cash settlement and the facilitation of improvements, he left the newspaper in 1979 to become an associate editor and columnist at &quot;The Washington Star&quot; in 1980-81. In 1980, he became a radio news commentator for National Public Radio (NPR). Beginning in 1982, Wilkins was a senior fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies.

Wilkins and fellow Black journalist William Raspberry were appointed concurrently as the first non-White members of the Pulitzer Prize Board in 1979; in this capacity, Wilkins served on an advisory panel that recommended the forfeiture of Janet Cooke&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing and as the Columbia University-based committee&#x27;s chairperson during the 1987-88 academic year. 

Wilkins was the Robinson Professor of History and American Culture at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia from 1988 until his retirement in 2007, becoming one of the most eminent faculty members at the incipient institution. He also retained his position at the Institute for Policy Studies until 1992. Wilkins was also the publisher of the NAACP&#x27;s journal, &quot;The Crisis&quot;.

Wilkins resided in Washington, D.C., and was married to Patricia King, a legal scholar at Georgetown University.

Wilkins died on March 26, 2017, in Kensington, Maryland, from complications of dementia. He was 85.

<doc id="1230777" wikidata="Q4455285" url="?curid=1230777" title="Diesel locomotives of Ireland">
<text>Although prototype diesel locomotives ran in Britain before World War II, the railways of both the Republic and Northern Ireland changed over much more rapidly from steam to diesel traction than those in Britain, due to the island&#x27;s limited coal reserves and (in the Republic) an ageing steam locomotive fleet.

Northern Ireland operated several diesel shunters as early as the 1930s. 
CIÉ&#x27;s first diesels consisted of five shunters built by CIÉ in 1947/48. 
The initial two diesel mainline locomotives were also built in Inchicore, in 1950/51, and fitted with Sulzer engines and MV traction equipment. This was followed in the mid-1950s with a large order from Britain fitted with Crossley engines, with notably poor results. From the early 1960s, locomotives with more reliable engines from General Motors Electro-Motive Division were adopted. In the late 1960s the Crossley engines were replaced by EMD 645 units in a major re-enginging programme. Since the early 1960s all new locomotives on the two Irish rail systems have been purchased from EMD, with the exception of three from Hunslet Engine Company of Leeds, England, for NIR in 1970.

==Ireland==

===Mass dieselisation===
In 1948, CIÉ commissioned a report from Sir James Milne (General Manager of the British Great Western Railway) on the problems of upgrading its rail services. Despite his recommendation to continue with steam traction, CIÉ decided to push for the complete dieselisation of its railway system, expecting substantial economies of scale.

The first of the two mainline diesel locomotives built by CIÉ at Inchicore Works, each with a Sulzer engine built by Vickers Armstrong, Class 113, entered service in April 1950, following completion of trials.

Subsequently, CIÉ placed one of the largest orders of its time, for 94 locomotives (60 Metro-Vick Class 001, or A Class, and 34 201 Class, or C Class locomotives) with a consortium of four British companies:
* Diesel engines from Crossley. The engine used in the A Class was the Crossley HST V8 of 1,200 horsepower (895 KW), relatively untested for railway use although the same engine was used in the 48 Western Australian Government Railways X and XA class locomotives built by Metropolitan Vickers in 1954-6 and the small build of 20 Type 2 Co-Bo locomotives for British Railways (later British Rail Class 28) of 1958–9
* Mechanicals from Metropolitan Cammell
* Electrical components from both the English Steel Corp. and the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Co.

Delivered to Inchicore Works between 1955 and 1958, the Class 001 was to become the mainstay of mainline passenger and freight services on the network for the next forty years. Parts were also ordered for a further 19 locos to be built at Inchicore Works.

From the outset, the two-stroke Crossley engines proved under-powered and unreliable. The 001s were not capable of reliably handling mainline work, while the Class 201, no longer required on branch line work due to Todd Andrews&#x27;s large scale closures, were unsuited to mainline work because of their low power (c.600 hp).

===The General Motors influence===
From the early 60s, CIÉ looked to GM, with their history of reliability. 15 121 Class were purchased in 1961. These were modified shunting locos (&quot;switchers&quot;) and proved an instant success. One drawback was the single cab construction requiring the loco to be turned at the end of each journey as the drivers refused to operate them &quot;long hood&quot; forward. They were modified in the mid-1970s for multiple unit operation and operated in consist, &quot;long hood&quot; to &quot;long hood&quot;, with their cabs at each end. 37 141 Class, delivered in 1962, were fitted with two cabs to overcome this problem. The delivery of these engines brought an end to regular steam working in April 1963. A third batch of GM locomotives (181 Class) were delivered in 1966, which were essentially 141s with more powerful engines.

Having experienced GM&#x27;s reliability, CIÉ decided in 1964 to fit higher-powered engines in both Class 001 and Class 201 locos. However, GM would only sell complete engine / generator assemblies and would not provide engines on their own. They finally agreed in 1967 to supply engines to enable re-engining of the Class 001. This was the first time that GM supplied engines for such purposes. The trials were a total success and over the next four years, all 94 Metrovicks were fitted with replacement EMD 645 engines.

Eighteen new GM locomotives were delivered in 1977. Visually resembling a stretched 141/181 Class, the new locomotives had a Co-Co wheel arrangement and were of significantly higher power, 2,475 h.p. The 071 Class with its higher speed and power went on to become the principal passenger locomotive on the Irish railway network for the next twenty years. The new 201 Class, again built by GM, superseded them in 1994–1995. These are currently the heaviest, fastest and most powerful diesel locomotives operating in Ireland (112 tons, max. speed 102 mph and 3,200 hp).

===Classification===
Initially, CIÉ numbered and classified its handful of early diesel locomotives in the same way as steam. However, it soon developed a series based on engine power Types, with the highest-powered locomotives being Type A and numbered in the Axx series, and the lowest powered being Type G and numbered in the G6xx series. Locomotive K801, ex GNRB, was a one-off prototype and did not truly fit in this scheme.

Since all the locomotives were in fact numbered in series, the letter prefix was dropped in 1972, as was the allocation of numbers according to power. Locomotives rebuilt with higher-powered engines were not renumbered, later locomotives simply taking the next available number series.

In the early to mid-1980s, locomotives started to be designated with the letters S and/or A after their number. For example, 124 was renumbered 124SA.

The &quot;S&quot; indicated that the locomotive had been fitted with Continuous Automatic Warning System (CAWS), an in-cab system that displays the aspect of the next signal. Locomotives not fitted with CAWS had restrictions imposed on their use.

The suffix &quot;A&quot; indicated that the locomotive&#x27;s air brakes had been commissioned. Until the introduction of the Mark 3, all Irish coaching stock used vacuum brakes but all locomotives since the 121 Class had also been equipped with air braking, albeit never commissioned. Only those whose air brakes were commissioned could haul the new coaches.

The suffix letters were dropped once all locomotives had their air brakes commissioned and been fitted with CAWS, and numbering continued as before.

==Northern Ireland==
A variety of small classes of diesel locomotives have operated on railways in Northern Ireland. From 2001, most items of rolling stock in use on NIR had 8000 added to their number so as to be part of the Translink number series, which also incorporates their road vehicles.

<text>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, written by herself is an autobiography by Harriet Jacobs, a mother and fugitive slave, published in 1861 by L. Maria Child, who edited the book for its author. Jacobs used the pseudonym Linda Brent. The book documents Jacobs&#x27; life as a slave and how she gained freedom for herself and for her children. Jacobs contributed to the genre of slave narrative by using the techniques of sentimental novels &quot;to address race and gender issues.&quot; She explores the struggles and sexual abuse that female slaves faced as well as their efforts to practice motherhood and protect their children when their children might be sold away.

In the book, Jacobs addresses White Northern women who fail to comprehend the evils of slavery. She makes direct appeals to their humanity to expand their knowledge and influence their thoughts about slavery as an institution.

Jacobs composed &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; after her escape to New York, while living and working at Idlewild, the home of writer and publisher Nathaniel Parker Willis.

==Historical context==
=== Biographical background ===
Harriet Jacobs was born into slavery in Edenton, North Carolina in 1813. When she was a child, her mistress taught her to read and write, skills that were extremely rare among slaves. At twelve years old, she fell into the hands of an abusive owner who harassed her sexually. When he threatened to sell her children, she hid in a tiny crawlspace under the roof of her grandmother&#x27;s house. After staying there for seven years, spending much of her time reading the Bible and also newspapers, she finally managed to escape to New York in 1842. 

Her brother, John S. Jacobs, who had also managed to escape from slavery, became more and more involved with the abolitionists led by William Lloyd Garrison, going on several anti-slavery lecturing tours from 1847 onwards. In 1849/50, Harriet Jacobs helped her brother running the &quot;Anti-Slavery Office and Reading Room&quot; in Rochester, New York, being in close contact with abolitionists and feminists like Frederick Douglass and Amy and Isaac Post. During that time she had the opportunity to read abolitionist literature and become acquainted with anti-slavery theory. In her autobiography she describes the effects of this period in her life: &quot;The more my mind had become enlightened, the more difficult it was for me to consider myself an article of property.&quot; Urged by her brother and by Amy Post, she started to write her autobiography in 1853, finishing the manuscript in 1858. During that time she was working as a nanny for the children of N. P. Willis. Still, she didn&#x27;t find a publisher until 1860, when Thayer &amp; Eldridge agreed to publish her manuscript and initiated her contact with Lydia Maria Child, who became the editor of the book, which was finally published in January 1861.

=== Abolitionist and African-American literature ===
When Jacobs started working on &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; in 1853, many works by abolitionist and African-American writers were already in print. In 1831 William Lloyd Garrison had started the publication of his weekly &quot;The Liberator&quot;.

In 1845, Frederick Douglass had published his first autobiography, &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave. Written by Himself&quot;, which became a bestseller and paved the way for subsequent slave narratives.

The White abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe published &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; in 1852, artfully combining the genres of slave narratives and sentimental novels. Although a work of fiction, Stowe based her novel on several accounts by eyewitnesses.

However, the relationship between Black and White abolitionist writers was not without problems. Garrison supplied a preface to Douglass&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot; that would later be analyzed as latently racist, and the relationship between the two male abolitionists deteriorated when Garrison was less than supportive to the idea of Douglass starting his own newspaper. That Stowe&#x27;s book became an instant bestseller was in part due to the fact that she shared her readers&#x27; racist mindset, explicitly stating that Black people were intellectually inferior and modeling the character of her protagonist, Uncle Tom, accordingly. When Jacobs suggested to Stowe that Stowe transform her story into a book, Jacobs perceived Stowe&#x27;s reaction as a racist insult, which she analyzed in a letter to her White friend Amy Post.

===Cult of True Womanhood===
In the antebellum period, the Cult of True Womanhood was prevalent among upper and middle-class White women. This set of ideals, as described by Barbara Welter, asserted that all women possessed (or should possess) the virtues of piety, purity, domesticity, and submissiveness. Venetria K. Patton explains that Jacobs and Harriet E. Wilson, who wrote &quot;Our Nig&quot;, reconfigured the genres of slave narrative and sentimental novel, claiming the titles of &quot;woman and mother&quot; for Black females, and suggesting that society&#x27;s definition of womanhood was too narrow. They argued and &quot;remodeled&quot; Stowe&#x27;s descriptions of Black maternity.

They also showed that the institution of slavery made it impossible for African-American women to control their virtue, as they were subject to the social and economic power of men. Jacobs showed that enslaved women had a different experience of motherhood but had strong feelings as mothers despite the constraints of their position.

Jacobs was clearly aware of the womanly virtues, as she referred to them as a means to appeal to female abolitionists to spur them into action to help protect enslaved Black women and their children. In the narrative, she explains life events that prevent Linda Brent from practicing these values, although she wants to. For example, as she cannot have a home of her own for her family, she cannot practice domestic virtues.

==Character list==
Linda Brent is Harriet Jacobs, the narrator and protagonist.

Aunt Martha is Molly Horniblow, Linda&#x27;s maternal grandmother. After briefly talking of her earliest childhood, her parents and her brother, Jacobs begins her book with the history of her grandmother. At the end of the book, Jacobs relates the death of her grandmother in 1853, soon after Jacobs had obtained her legal freedom, using the very last sentence to mention the &quot;tender memories of my good old grandmother.&quot; Molly Horniblow obtained her freedom in 1828, when Jacobs was about 15 years old, because friends of hers bought her with the money she had earned by working at night.

Benjamin is Joseph Horniblow, Aunt Martha&#x27;s youngest child and Linda&#x27;s uncle. Chapter 4, &quot;The Slave Who Dared to Feel like a Man&quot;, is largely dedicated to his story: Being only a few years older than Linda, &quot;he seemed more like my brother than my uncle&quot;. Linda and Benjamin share the longing for freedom. When his master attempts to whip him, he throws him to the ground and then runs away to avoid the punishment of a public whipping. He is caught, paraded in chains through Edenton, and put into jail. Although his mother entreats him to ask forgiveness of his master, he proudly refuses and is finally sold to New Orleans. Later, his brother Mark (called &quot;Philipp&quot; in the book), unexpectedly meets him in New York, learning that he has escaped again, but is in a very poor physical condition and without support. After that meeting, the family never heard from him again. Linda and her brother see him as a hero. Both of them would later name their son for him.

William is John S. Jacobs, Linda&#x27;s brother, to whom she is close.

Benny is Joseph Jacobs, Linda&#x27;s son.

Ellen is Louisa Matilda Jacobs, Linda&#x27;s daughter.

Dr. Flint is Dr. James Norcom, Linda&#x27;s master and tormentor. J. F. Yellin, after researching his surviving private letters and notes, writes about his personality: &quot;Norcom was a loving and dominating husband and father. In his serious and sophisticated interest in medicine, his commitment as a physician, and his educated discourse, he appears unlike the villain Jacobs portrays. But his humorlessness, his egoism, his insistently controlling relationships with his wife and children ... suggest the portrait Jacobs draws. This impression is supported by ... his unforgiving fury against those he viewed as enemies. It is underscored by his admitted passionate responses to women.&quot;

Mrs. Flint is Mary &quot;Maria&quot; Norcom, Linda&#x27;s mistress and Dr. Flint&#x27;s wife.

Emily Flint is Mary Matilda Norcom, Dr. Flint&#x27;s daughter and Linda&#x27;s legal owner.

Mr. Sands is Samuel Tredwell Sawyer, Linda&#x27;s White sexual partner and the father of her children, Benny and Ellen. 

Mr. Bruce is Nathaniel Parker Willis.

The second Mrs. Bruce is Cornelia Grinnel Willis.

== Overview ==

Chapters 1 and 2 describe the narrator&#x27;s childhood and the story of her grandmother until she got her freedom. The narrator&#x27;s story is then continued in chapters 4 to 7, which tell of the longing for freedom she shares with her uncle Benjamin and her brother William, Benjamin&#x27;s escape, the sexual harassment by Dr. Flint, the jealousy of his wife, and the lover who she is forbidden to marry. Chapters 10 and 11 tell of her affair with Mr. Sands and the birth of her first child. Chapters 14 to 21 tell of the birth of her second child, her removal from the town to Flint&#x27;s plantation, her flight and her concealment in her grandmother&#x27;s garret. The nearly seven years she had to spend in that narrow place are described in chapters 22 to 28, the last chapters of which concentrate on the fate of family members during that time: the escape of her brother William (chapter 26), the plans made for the children (27), and the cruel treatment and death of her aunt Nancy (28). Her dramatic escape to Philadelphia is the subject of chapters 29 and 30. Chapters 31 to 36 describe her short stay in Philadelphia, her reunion with the children, her new work as nanny for the Bruce family, and her flight to Boston when she is threatened with recapture by Flint. Chapter 35 focusses on her experiences with northern racism. Her journey to England with Mr. Bruce and his baby Mary is the subject of chapter 37. Finally, chapters 38 to 41 deal with renewed threats of recapture, which are made much more serious by the Fugitive Slave Law, the &quot;confession&quot; of her affair with Mr. Sands to her daughter, her stay with Isaac and Amy Post in Rochester, the final attempt of her legal owner to capture her, the obtaining of her legal freedom, and the death of her grandmother.

The other chapters are dedicated to special subjects: Chapter 3 describes the hiring out and selling of slaves on New Year&#x27;s Day, chapter 8 is called &quot;What Slaves Are Taught to Think of the North&quot;, chapter 9 gives various examples of cruel treatment of slaves, chapter 12 describes the narrator&#x27;s experience of the anti-Black violence in the wake of Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion, and chapter 13 is called &quot;The Church And Slavery&quot;.
== Publication history ==
=== Early publication attempts ===
In May 1858, Harriet Jacobs sailed to England, hoping to find a publisher there. She carried good letters of introduction, but wasn&#x27;t able to get her manuscript into print. The reasons for her failure are not clear. Yellin supposes that her contacts among the British abolitionists feared that the story of her liaison with Sawyer would be too much for Victorian Britain&#x27;s prudery. Disheartened, Jacobs returned to her work at Idlewild and made no further efforts to publish her book until the fall of 1859.

On October 16, 1859, the anti-slavery activist John Brown tried to incite a slave rebellion at Harper&#x27;s Ferry. Brown, who was executed in December, was considered a martyr and hero by many abolitionists, among them Harriet Jacobs, who added a tribute to Brown as the final chapter to her manuscript. She then sent the manuscript to publishers Phillips and Samson in Boston. They were ready to publish it under the condition that either Nathaniel Parker Willis or Harriet Beecher Stowe would supply a preface. Jacobs was unwilling to ask Willis, who held pro-slavery views, but she asked Stowe, who declined. Soon after, the publishers failed, thus frustrating Jacobs&#x27;s second attempt to get her story printed.
=== Lydia Maria Child as the book&#x27;s editor ===
Jacobs now contacted Thayer and Eldridge, who had recently published a sympathizing biography of John Brown. Thayer and Eldridge demanded a preface by Lydia Maria Child. Jacobs confessed to Amy Post, that after suffering another rejection from Stowe, she could hardly bring herself to asking another famous writer, but she &quot;resolved to make my last effort&quot;.

Jacobs met Child in Boston, and Child not only agreed to write a preface, but also to become the editor of the book. Child then re-arranged the material according to a more chronological order. She also suggested dropping the final chapter on Brown and adding more information on the anti-black violence which occurred in Edenton after Nat Turner&#x27;s 1831 rebellion. She kept contact with Jacobs via mail, but the two women failed to meet a second time during the editing process, because with Cornelia Willis passing through a dangerous pregnancy and premature birth Jacobs was not able to leave Idlewild.

After the book had been stereotyped, Thayer and Eldridge, too, failed. Jacobs succeeded in buying the stereotype plates and to get the book printed and bound.

In January 1861, nearly four years after she had finished the manuscript, Jacobs&#x27;s &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; finally appeared before the public. The next month, her brother John S. published his own, much shorter memoir, entitled &quot;A True Tale of Slavery&quot;, in London. Both siblings relate in their respective narratives their own experiences, experiences made together, and episodes in the life of the other sibling.

In her book, Harriet Jacobs doesn&#x27;t mention the town or even the state, where she was held as a slave, and changes all personal names, given names as well as family names, with the only exception of the Post couple, whose names are given correctly. However, John Jacobs (called &quot;William&quot; in his sister&#x27;s book) mentions Edenton as his birthplace and uses the correct given names, but abbreviates most family names. So Dr. Norcom is &quot;Dr. Flint&quot; in Harriet&#x27;s book, but &quot;Dr. N-&quot; in John&#x27;s. An author&#x27;s name is not given on the title page, but the &quot;Preface by the author&quot; is signed &quot;Linda Brent&quot; and the narrator is called by that name throughout the story.

== Themes ==
=== Resistance ===
A turning point in the youth of Frederick Douglass, according to his autobiographies, was the fight against his brutal master. In Jacobs&#x27;s autobiography there are two slaves who dare to resist their masters physically, although such an act of resistance normally is punished most cruelly: Her uncle Joseph (called &quot;Benjamin&quot; in the book) throws his master to the ground when he attempts to whip him, and then runs away to avoid the punishment of a public whipping. Her brother John (called &quot;William&quot;) is still a boy, when the son of his master tries to bind and whip him. John puts up a fight and wins. Although the &quot;young master&quot; is hurt, John gets away with it. Other slaves mentioned in the book, women as well as men, resist by running away, although some have to pay dearly for that. Jacobs&#x27;s uncle Joseph is caught, paraded in chains through Edenton and put in jail, where his health suffers so much that he has to be sold for a very low price. Jacobs also tells of another fugitive who is killed by the slave catchers.

While physical resistance is less of an option for enslaved women, they still have many ways of resisting. Molly Horniblow, Jacobs&#x27;s beloved grandmother, should have been set free at the death of her owner in 1827. But Dr. Norcom, Jacobs&#x27;s abusive master and the son-in-law and executor of the will of Molly Horniblow&#x27;s owner, wants to cheat her out of her freedom, citing debts which have to be settled by selling the deceased&#x27;s human property. Norcom tells the enslaved woman that he wants to sell her privately in order to save her the shame of being sold at public auction, but Molly Horniblow insists on suffering that very shame. The auction turns out according to Molly Horniblow&#x27;s plans: A friend of hers offers the ridiculously low price of $50, and nobody among the sympathizing White people of Edenton is willing to offer more. Soon after, Jacobs&#x27;s grandmother is set free.

Both Harriet Jacobs and her brother John frustrate the threats of their master by simply choosing what was meant as a threat: When Dr. Norcom throws John into the jail, which regularly serves as the place to guard slaves that are to be sold, John sends a slave trader to his master telling him he wants to be sold. When Norcom tells Harriet to choose between becoming his concubine and going to the plantation, she chooses the latter, knowing that plantation slaves are even worse off than town slaves.

Harriet Jacobs also knows to fight back with words: On various occasions, she doesn&#x27;t follow the pattern of submissive behavior that is expected of a slave, protesting when her master beats her and when he forbids her to marry the man she loves, and even telling him that his demand of a sexual relationship is against the law of God.

=== Pro-slavery propaganda and cruel reality ===
Jacobs&#x27;s employer, N. P. Willis, was the founding editor of the &quot;Home Journal&quot;. Some years before she started working on her book, he had published an anonymous story called &quot;The Night Funeral of a Slave&quot; about a Northerner who witnesses a funeral of an old slave which he interprets as a sign for the love between the master and his slaves. The story ends with the conclusion drawn by the northern narrator, &quot;that the negroes of the south are the happiest and most contented people on the face of the earth&quot;. In 1849, that story was republished by Frederick Douglass, in order to criticize pro-slavery Northerners.

In her autobiography, Jacobs includes a chapter about the death and funeral of her aunt Betty (called &quot;Nancy&quot; in the book), commenting that &quot;Northern travellers ... might have described this tribute of respect to the humble dead as ... a touching proof of the attachment between slaveholders and their servants&quot;, but adding that the slaves might have told that imaginative traveler &quot;a different story&quot;: The funeral had not been paid for by aunt Betty&#x27;s owner, but by her brother, Jacobs&#x27;s uncle Mark (called &quot;Philipp&quot; in the book), and Jacobs herself could neither say farewell to her dying aunt nor attend the funeral, because she would have been immediately returned to her &quot;tormentor&quot;. Jacobs also gives the reason for her aunt&#x27;s childlessness and early death: Dr. and Mrs. Norcom did not allow her enough rest, but required her services by day and night. Venetria K. Patton describes the relationship between Mrs. Norcom and Aunt Betty as a &quot;parasitic one&quot;, because Mary Horniblow, who would later become Mrs. Norcom, and aunt Betty had been &quot;foster-sisters&quot;, both being nursed by Jacobs&#x27;s grandmother who had to wean her own daughter Betty early in order to have enough milk for the child of her mistress by whom Betty would eventually be &quot;slowly murdered&quot;.

=== Church and slavery ===
At some places, Jacobs describes religious slaves. Her grandmother teaches her grandchildren to accept their status as slaves as God&#x27;s will, and her prayers are mentioned at several points of the story, including Jacobs&#x27;s last farewell to her before boarding the ship to freedom, when the old woman prays fervently for a successful escape. While Jacobs enjoys an uneasy freedom living with her grandmother after her first pregnancy, an old enslaved man approaches her and asks her to teach him, so that he can read the Bible, stating &quot;I only wants to read dis book, dat I may know how to live, den I hab no fear &#x27;bout dying.&quot; Jacobs also tells that during her stay in England in 1845/46 she found her way back to the religion of her upbringing: &quot;Grace entered my heart, and I knelt at the communion table, I trust, in true humility of soul.&quot;

However, she is very critical regarding the religion of the slaveholders, stating &quot;there is a great difference between Christianity and religion at the south.&quot; She describes &quot;the contemptuous manner in which the communion [was] administered to colored people&quot;. She also tells of a Methodist class leader, who in civil life is the town constable, performing the &quot;Christian office&quot; – as Jacobs calls it in bitter irony – of whipping slaves for a fee of 50 cents. She also criticizes &quot;the buying and selling of slaves, by professed ministers of the gospel.&quot;

Jacobs&#x27;s distinction between &quot;Christianity and religion at the south&quot; has a parallel in Frederick Douglass&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot;, where he distinguishes the &quot;slaveholding religion&quot; from &quot;Christianity proper&quot;, between which he sees the &quot;widest, possible difference&quot;, stating, &quot;I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ: I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical Christianity of this land.&quot;

== &quot;Incidents&quot; as a feminist book ==
According to Yellin, &quot;Incidents&quot; has a &quot;radical feminist content.&quot; Yellin states that &quot;Incidents&quot; is linked to the then popular genre of the seduction novel. That genre, examples of which include &quot;Charlotte Temple&quot; (1791) and &quot;The Quadroons&quot;, written in 1842 by M. Lydia Child, who would later become the editor of &quot;Incidents&quot;, features the story of a virtuous, but helpless woman seduced by a man. Her failure to adhere to the standard of sexual behavior set by the &quot;white patriarchy&quot;, &quot;inevitably&quot; leads to her &quot;self-destruction and death&quot;. Although Jacobs describes her sexual transgression (i.e. the liaison with Sawyer) in terms of guilt and sin, she also sees it as a &quot;mistaken tactic in the struggle for freedom&quot;. Most important, the book does not end with self-destruction, but with liberty.

According to Yellin, &quot;a central pattern in &quot;Incidents&quot; shows white women betraying allegiances of race and class to assert their stronger allegiance to the sisterhood of all women&quot;: When Jacobs goes into hiding, a White woman who is herself a slaveholder hides her in her own house for a month, and when she is threatened with recapture, her female employer&#x27;s plan to rescue her involves entrusting her own baby to Jacobs.

Jacobs presents herself as struggling to build a home for herself and her children. &quot;This endorsement of domestic values links &quot;Incidents&quot; to what has been called &#x27;woman&#x27;s fiction&#x27;&quot;, in which a heroine overcomes hardships by finding the necessary resources inside herself. But unlike &quot;woman&#x27;s fiction&quot;, &quot;&quot;Incidents&quot; is an attempt to move women to political action&quot;, thus stepping out of the domestic sphere at that time commonly held to be the proper sphere for women and joining the public sphere.

Jacobs discusses &quot;the painful personal subject&quot; of her sexual history &quot;in order to politicize it, to insist that the forbidden topic of sexual abuse of slave women be included in public discussions of the slavery question.&quot; In telling of her daughter&#x27;s acceptance of her sexual history, she &quot;shows black women overcoming the divisive sexual ideology of the white patriarchy&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== 19th century ===

The book was promoted via the abolitionist networks and was well received by the critics. Jacobs arranged for a publication in Great Britain, which appeared in the first months of 1862, soon followed by a pirated edition. &quot;&quot;Incidents&quot; was immediately acknowledged as a contribution to Afro-American letters.&quot;

The publication did not cause contempt as Jacobs had feared. On the contrary, Jacobs gained respect. Although she had used a pseudonym, in abolitionist circles she was regularly introduced with words like &quot;Mrs. Jacobs, the author of Linda&quot;, thereby conceding her the honorific &quot;Mrs.&quot; which normally was reserved for married women. The &quot;London Daily News&quot; wrote in 1862, that Linda Brent was a true &quot;heroine&quot;, giving an example &quot;of endurance and persistency in the struggle for liberty&quot; and &quot;moral rectitude&quot;.

&quot;Incidents&quot; &quot;may well have influenced&quot; &quot;Iola Leroy, or Shadows Uplifted&quot;, an 1892 novel by Black author Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, &quot;which in turn helped shape the writings of Zora Neale Hurston and other foremothers of black women writing today.&quot;

Still, &quot;Incidents&quot; was not republished, and &quot;by the twentieth century both Jacobs and her book were forgotten&quot;.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
The new interest in women and minority issues that came with the American civil rights movement also led to the rediscovery of &quot;Incidents&quot;. The first new editions began to appear at the end of the 1960s.

Prior to Jean Fagan Yellin&#x27;s research in the 1980s, the accepted academic opinion, voiced by such historians as John Blassingame, was that &quot;Incidents&quot; was a fictional novel written by Lydia Maria Child. However, Yellin found and used a variety of historical documents, including from the Amy Post papers at the University of Rochester, state and local historical societies, and the Horniblow and Norcom papers at the North Carolina state archives, to establish both that Harriet Jacobs was the true author of &quot;Incidents,&quot; and that the narrative was her autobiography, not a work of fiction. Her edition of &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; was published in 1987 with the endorsement of Professor John Blassingame.

In 2004, Yellin published an exhaustive biography (394 pages) entitled &quot;Harriet Jacobs: A Life&quot;.

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; review of Yellin&#x27;s 2004 biography, David S. Reynolds states that &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; &quot;and &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave&quot; are commonly viewed as the two most important slave narratives.&quot;

In the &quot;Acknowledgments&quot; of his bestselling 2016 novel, &quot;The Underground Railroad&quot;, Colson Whitehead mentions Jacobs: &quot;Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs, obviously.&quot; The heroine of the novel, Cora, has to hide in a place in the attic of a house in Jacobs&#x27;s native North Carolina, where like Jacobs she is not able to stand, but like her can observe the outside life through a hole that &quot;had been carved from the inside, the work of a previous occupant&quot; (p. 185).

In 2017 Jacobs was the subject of an episode of the Futility Closet Podcast, where her experience living in a crawlspace was compared with the wartime experience of Patrick Fowler.

According to a 2017 article in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, a 2013 translation of &quot;Incidents&quot; by Yuki Horikoshi became a bestseller in Japan.

=== The garret ===

The space of the garret, in which Jacobs confined herself for seven years, has been taken up as a metaphor in Black critical thought, most notably by theorist Katherine McKittrick. In her text &quot;Demonic Grounds: Black Women and the Cartographies of Struggle&quot;, McKittrick argues that the garret &quot;highlights how geography is transformed by Jacobs into a usable and paradoxical space.&quot; When she initially enters her &quot;loophole of retreat,&quot; Jacobs states that &quot;[its] continued darkness was oppressive…without one gleam of light…[and] with no object for my eye to rest upon.&quot; However, once she bores holes through the space with a gimlet, Jacobs creates for herself an oppositional perspective on the workings of the plantation—she comes to inhabit what McKittrick terms a &quot;disembodied master-eye, seeing from nowhere.&quot; The garret offers Jacobs an alternate way of seeing, allowing her to reimagine freedom while shielding her from the hypervisibility to which Black people—especially Black women—are always already subject.

Katherine McKittrick reveals how theories of geography and spatial freedom produce alternative understandings and possibilities within Black feminist thought. By centering geography in her analysis, McKittrick portrays the ways in which gendered-racial-sexual domination is spatially organized. McKittrick writes, &quot;Recognizing black women&#x27;s knowledgeable positions as integral to physical, cartographic, and experiential geographies within and through dominant spatial models also creates an analytical space for black feminist geographies: black women&#x27;s political, feminist, imaginary, and creative concerns that respatialize the geographic legacy of racism-sexism.&quot;

In analyzing the hiding place of Harriet Jacobs (Linda Brent) – the space of her grandmother&#x27;s garret – McKittrick illuminates the tensions that exist within this space and how it occupies contradictory positions. Not only is the space of the garret one of resistance and freedom for Brent, but it is also a space of confinement and concealment. That is, the garret operates as a prison and, simultaneously, as a space of liberation. For Brent, freedom in the garret takes the form of loss of speech, movement, and consciousness. McKittrick writes, &quot;Brent&#x27;s spatial options are painful; the garret serves as a disturbing, but meaningful, response to slavery.&quot; As McKittrick reveals, the geographies of slavery are about gendered-racial-sexual captivities – in these sense, the space of the garret is both one of captivity and protection for Brent.

<text>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave is an 1845 memoir and treatise on abolition written by African-American orator and former slave Frederick Douglass during his time in Lynn, Massachusetts. It is the first of Douglass&#x27;s three autobiographies, the others being &quot;My Bondage and My Freedom&quot; (1855) and &quot;Life and Times of Frederick Douglass&quot; (1881, revised 1892).

&quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; is generally held to be the most famous of a number of narratives written by former slaves during the same period. In factual detail, the text describes the events of his life and is considered to be one of the most influential pieces of literature to fuel the abolitionist movement of the early 19th century in the United States.

&quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; comprises eleven chapters that recount Douglass&#x27;s life as a slave and his ambition to become a free man. It contains two introductions by well-known white abolitionists: a preface by William Lloyd Garrison and a letter by Wendell Phillips, both arguing for the veracity of the account and the literacy of its author.

==Synopsis==

Douglass begins by explaining that he does not know the date of his birth (in his third autobiography, he wrote, &quot;I suppose myself to have been born in February 1817&quot;), and that his mother died when he was 7 years old. He has very few memories of her (children were commonly separated from their mothers), only of the rare nighttime visit. He thinks his father is a white man, possibly his owner. At a very early age, he sees his Aunt Hester being whipped. Douglass details the cruel interaction that occurs between slaves and slaveholders, as well as how slaves are supposed to behave in the presence of their masters. Douglass says that fear is what kept many slaves in servitude, for when they told the truth they were punished by their owners.
Douglass is moved to Baltimore, Maryland. He believes that if he had not been moved, he would have remained a slave his entire life. He starts to hope for a better future. He discusses the wife of his new owner, Sophia Auld, who initially is kind to him but later turns cruel. Initially, she teaches Douglass the alphabet and how to spell small words, but her husband, Hugh Auld, disapproves and states that if slaves could read, they would not be fit to be slaves, being unmanageable and sad. (Anti-literacy laws also prohibited teaching antebellum slaves to read and write.) Upon hearing why Hugh Auld disapproves of slaves being taught how to read, Douglass realizes the importance of reading and the possibilities that this skill could help him. He takes it upon himself to learn how to read and does so by playing games with white neighboring children. Douglass then gains an understanding of the word &quot;abolition&quot; and develops the idea to run away to the North. He also learns how to write and how to read well.

When Douglass is ten or eleven, his master dies, and his property, including his slaves, is divided between the master&#x27;s son and daughter. Douglass sees how slaves are valued along with livestock, deepening his hatred of slavery. He feels lucky when he is sent back to Baltimore to live with the Auld family.

He is then moved through a few situations before being sent to St. Michael&#x27;s. His regret at not having attempted to run away is evident, but on his voyage he makes a mental note that he traveled in a north-easterly direction and considers this information to be of extreme importance. For some time, he lives with Thomas Auld who doesn&#x27;t become a humane master even after attending a Methodist camp meeting. Douglass is pleased when he eventually is lent to Edward Covey for a year, simply because he would be fed. Covey is known as a &quot;negro-breaker&quot;, who breaks the will of slaves.

While under Covey&#x27;s control, Douglass is a field hand and has an especially hard time at the tasks required of him. He is harshly whipped almost on a weekly basis, apparently due to his awkwardness. He is worked and beaten to exhaustion, which finally causes him to collapse one day while working in the fields. Because of this, he is brutally beaten once more by Covey. Douglass eventually complains to Thomas Auld, who subsequently sends him back to Covey. A few days later, Covey attempts to tie up Douglass, but he fights back. After a two-hour long physical battle, Douglass ultimately conquers Covey. After this fight, he is never beaten again. Douglass is not punished by the law, which is believed to be due to the fact that Covey cherishes his reputation as a &quot;negro-breaker&quot;, which would be jeopardized if others knew what happened. When his one-year contract ends under Covey, Douglass is sent to live on William Freeland&#x27;s plantation. Douglass comments on the abuse suffered under Covey, a religious man, and the relative peace under the more secular Freeland. On Freeland&#x27;s plantation, Douglass befriends other slaves and teaches them how to read. Douglass and a small group of slaves plan to escape, but they are caught and Douglass is jailed. Following his release about a week later, he is sent to Baltimore once more, this time to learn a trade. He becomes an apprentice in a shipyard under William Gardner, where he is disliked by several white apprentices due to his slave status and race; at one point he gets into a fight with them and they nearly gouge out his left eye. Woefully beaten, Douglass goes to Hugh Auld, who is kind regarding this situation and refuses to let Douglass return to the shipyard. Hugh Auld tries to find a lawyer but all refuse, saying they can only do something for a white person. Sophia Auld, who had turned cruel under the influence of slavery, feels pity for Douglass and tends to the wound at his left eye until he is healed. At this point, Douglass is employed as a caulker and receives wages but is forced to give every cent to Auld in due time. Douglass eventually finds his own job and plans the day on which he will escape to the North. He succeeds in reaching New Bedford, but he does not give details in order to protect those who help others flee enslavement. Douglass unites with his fiancée and begins working as his own master. He attends an anti-slavery convention and eventually becomes a well-known orator and abolitionist.

After the main narrative, Douglass&#x27;s appendix clarifies that he is not against religion as a whole; instead he referred to &quot;the &quot;slaveholding religion&quot; of this land, and with no possible reference to Christianity proper&quot;. He condemns the hypocrisy in southern Christianity between what is taught and the actions of the slaveowners who practice it. He compares their Christianity to the practices of &quot;the ancient scribes and Pharisees&quot; and quotes passages from Matthew 23 calling them hypocrites. At the end, he includes a satire of a hymn &quot;said to have been drawn, several years before the present anti-slavery agitation began, by a northern Methodist preacher, who, while residing at the south, had an opportunity to see slaveholding morals, manners, and piety, with his own eyes&quot;, titled simply &quot;A Parody&quot;. It criticizes religious slaveowners, each stanza ending with the phrase &quot;heavenly union&quot;, mimicking the original&#x27;s form.

==Publication history==

&quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; was published on May 1, 1845, and within four months of this publication, five thousand copies were sold. By 1860, almost 30,000 copies were sold. After publication, he left Lynn, Massachusetts and sailed to England and Ireland for two years in fear of being recaptured by his owner in the United States. While in Britain and Ireland, he gained supporters who paid $710.96 to purchase his emancipation from his legal owner. One of the more significant reasons Douglass published his &quot;Narrative&quot; was to offset the demeaning manner in which white people viewed him. When he spoke in public, his white abolitionist associates established limits to what he could say on the platform. More specifically, they did not want him to analyze the current slavery issues or to shape the future for black people. However, once &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; was published, he was given the liberty to speak more honestly. Because of the work in his &quot;Narrative&quot;, Douglass gained significant credibility from those who previously did not believe the story of his past. While Douglass was in Ireland, the Dublin edition of the book was published by the abolitionist printer Richard D. Webb to great acclaim and Douglass would write extensively in later editions very positively about his experience in Ireland. His newfound liberty on the platform eventually led him to start a black newspaper against the advice of his &quot;fellow&quot; abolitionists. The publication of &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; opened several doors, not only for Douglass&#x27;s ambitious work, but also for the anti-slavery movement of that time.

==Reactions to the text==
&quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; received many positive reviews, but some people opposed it. One of its biggest critics, A. C. C. Thompson, was a neighbor of Thomas Auld, who was Douglass&#x27;s master for some time. In Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Letter from a Slave Holder&quot;, he claimed that the slave he knew was &quot;an unlearned, and rather an ordinary negro&quot;. Thompson was confident that Douglass &quot;was not capable of writing the Narrative&quot;. He also disputed Douglass&#x27;s description in the &quot;Narrative&quot; of various cruel white slave holders that he either knew or knew of.

Prior to the publication of the &quot;Narrative&quot;, the public could not fathom how a former slave could appear to be so educated. Upon listening to his oratory, many were skeptical of the stories he told. After publication of the &quot;Narrative&quot;, however, the public was swayed. Margaret Fuller, a prominent transcendentalist, author, and editor, admired Douglass&#x27;s book: &quot;we have never read [a narrative] more simple, true, coherent, and warm with genuine feeling&quot;. She also suggested that &quot;every one may read his book and see what a mind might have been stifled in bondage, — what a man may be subjected to the insults of spendthrift dandies, or the blows of mercenary brutes, in whom there is no whiteness except of the skin, no humanity in the outward form&quot;... Douglass&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot; was influential in the anti-slavery movement.

==Influence on contemporary black studies==

Angela Y. Davis analyzed Douglass&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot; in two lectures delivered at UCLA in 1969, titled &quot;Recurring Philosophical Themes in Black Literature.&quot; Those lectures were subsequently published during Davis&#x27;s imprisonment in 1970–1971 as the 24-page pamphlet &quot;Lectures on Liberation&quot;. The lectures, along with a 2009 introduction by Davis, were republished in Davis&#x27;s 2010 new critical edition of the &quot;Narrative&quot;.

The first chapter of this text has also been mobilized in several major texts that have become foundational texts in contemporary Black studies: Hortense Spillers in her article &quot;Mama&#x27;s Baby, Papa&#x27;s Maybe: An American Grammar Book” (1987); Saidiya Hartman in her book &quot;Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America&quot; (1997), and Fred Moten in his book &quot;In the Break: The Aesthetics of the Black Radical Tradition&quot; (2003). Each author uniquely contends with and navigates through Douglass’s writing. Specifically, each author has a divergent approach to revisiting or reproducing narratives of the suffering enslaved body. These divergences on Douglass are further reflected in their differing explorations of the conditions where subject and object positions of the enslaved body are produced and/or troubled. Spillers mobilizes Douglass’s description of his and his siblings’ early separation from their mother and subsequent estrangement from each other to articulate how the syntax of subjectivity, in particular “kinship”, has a historically specific relationship to the objectifying formations of chattel slavery which denied genetic links and familial bonds between the enslaved. This denial was part of the processes that worked to reinforce the enslaved position as property and object. Spillers frames Douglass’s narrative as writing that, although frequently returned to, still has the ability to “astonish” contemporary readers with each return to this scene of enslaved grief and loss (Spillers, “Mama’s Baby”, 76). By tracing the historical conditions of captivity through which slave humanity is defined as “absence from a subject position” narratives like Douglass’s, chronicles of the Middle Passage, and Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, are framed as impression points that have not lost their affective potential or become problematically familiar through repetitions or revisions (Spillers, “Mama’s Baby”, 66). Spillers own (re)visitation of Douglass’s narrative suggests that these efforts are a critical component to her assertion that “[i]n order for me to speak a truer word concerning myself, I must strip down through layers of attenuated meanings, made an excess in time, over time, assigned by a particular historical order, and there await whatever marvels of my own inventiveness” (Spillers, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Baby&quot;, 65).

In contrast to Spiller’s articulation that repetition does not rob Douglass’s narrative of its power, Saidiya Hartman explores how an over familiarity with narratives of the suffering enslaved body is problematic. In Hartman&#x27;s work, repeated “exposure of the violated body” is positioned as a process that can lead to a benumbing “indifference to suffering” (Hartman, Scenes of Objection, 4). This turn away from Douglass’ description of the violence carried out against his Aunt Hester is contextualized by Hartman&#x27;s critical examination of 19th century abolitionist writings in the Antebellum South. These abolitionist narratives included extreme representations of violence carried out against the enslaved body which were included to establish the slave&#x27;s humanity and evoke empathy while exposing the terrors of the institution. However, Hartman posits that these abolitionist efforts, which may have intended to convey enslaved subjectivities, actually aligned more closely to replications of objectivity since they “reinforce[d] the ‘thingly’ quality of the captive by reducing the body to evidence” (Hartman, Scenes of Subjection, 19). Instead of concentrating on these narratives that dramatized violence and the suffering black body, Hartman is more focused on revealing the quotidian ways that enslaved personhood and objectivity were selectively constructed or brought into tension in scenes like the coffle, coerced performances of slave leisure on the plantation, and the popular theater of the Antebellum South.

Fred Moten&#x27;s engagement with &quot;Narrative of The Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; echoes Spillers assertion that “every writing as a revision makes the ‘discovery’ all over again” (Spillers, 69). In his book chapter “Resistance of the Object: Aunt Hester’s Scream” he speaks to Hartman&#x27;s move away from Aunt Hester&#x27;s experience of violence. Moten questions whether Hartman&#x27;s opposition to reproducing this narrative is not actually a direct move through a relationship between violence and the captive body positioned as object, that she had intended to avoid. Moten suggests that as Hartman outlines the reasons for her opposition, her written reference to the narrative and the violence of its content may indeed be an inevitable reproduction. This is reflected in his question “of whether performance in general is ever outside the economy of reproduction” (Moten, In the Break, 4). A key parameter in Moten&#x27;s analytical method and the way he engages with Hartman&#x27;s work is an exploration of blackness as a positional framework through which objectivity and humanity are performed. This suggests that an attempt to move beyond the violence and object position of Aunt Hester would always be first a move through these things. Through this framework of the performativity of blackness Moten&#x27;s revisitation of Douglass’s narrative explores how the sounds of black performance might trouble conventional understandings of subjectivity and subjective speech.

<doc id="1230797" wikidata="Q311035" url="?curid=1230797" title="José Kléberson">
<text>José Kléberson Pereira (born 19 June 1979), commonly known as José Kléberson or simply Kléberson, is a Brazilian football coach and former player who is currently the assistant coach of New York City FC. 

A former midfielder, he previously played for Brazil 32 times between 2002 and 2010, scoring two goals, and was part of the squad that won the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

==Playing career==
===Club===
====Atlético Paranaense====
Kléberson was born and raised in the provincial town of Uraí in the southern Brazilian state of Paraná. He began his football career with Atlético Paranaense. There, Kléberson won the Paraná State League in 2000 and 2001, and the Brazilian Série A title in 2001. His performances for Atlético Paranaense led to Luiz Felipe Scolari calling him up to the Brazil national team for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan.

====Manchester United====
His World Cup performances led to Scolari declaring Kléberson the driving force behind Brazil&#x27;s cup-winning side, and drew interest from several European teams; Barcelona, Newcastle United, Leeds United and Celtic all expressed an interest. Leeds, failed to secure the signing after Kléberson decided against leaving Brazil without his girlfriend, who he was unable to marry until her 16th birthday, and eventually it was Manchester United who signed Kléberson, paying a fee of £6.5 million on 12 August 2003 alongside 4 other signings, including notable winger Cristiano Ronaldo. Seen as a replacement for Juan Sebastián Verón, Kléberson was injured in his second appearance for the club and made only 20 appearances in two seasons. He scored two league goals in his time at Manchester United, both coming in home wins against Blackburn Rovers and Everton.

====Beşiktaş====

On 6 August 2005, Kléberson signed for Turkish club Beşiktaş for €2.95 million. He signed a three-year deal, with the option of a further 12 months.

Kléberson unilaterally terminated the contract after claiming the club failed to pay his wages on time.

====Flamengo====
Kléberson signed with Flamengo on 27 September 2007 as a free agent, but he was unable to play for the club until February 2008, due to problems related to his resignation from Beşiktaş. On 10 August 2007 (announced on 27 August), the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber passed a decision that Kléberson had to pay Beşiktaş €3.18 million as for the compensation of breach of contract. and Besiktas had to pay US$461,112 as outstanding wage. Furthermore, Kléberson was suspended for four months (retroactively from 27 September 2007) Kléberson and the club later agreed to reduce the compensation from €3.18 million to €1 million.

Kléberson&#x27;s first matches for his new club were on the reserves team in several matches of the Rio State League. His climb to the first team started slowly as he began to play consistently in the Copa Libertadores. Kléberson earned an important spot in the midfield after the transfers of Renato Augusto and Marcinho.

After returning to the first team, Kléberson&#x27;s good spell in 2009 was interrupted on 12 August, in a friendly match against Estonia, where he suffered a foul and fell, causing him a dislocated shoulder. Kléberson had surgery and was expected to miss the rest of the year. He managed to recover quickly being able to return on 22 November in a 0–0 draw against Goiás and also playing in the 2–1 win over Grêmio and winning the 2009 Brazilian Série A, the second in his career.

In the 2010 pre-season, Palmeiras speculated the possibility of involving Kléberson in a trade for Vágner Love, but Flamengo refused to accept the idea.

====Bahia====
After a poor year playing on loan for Atlético Paranaense, when the club was relegated to Série B, Kléberson signed for Bahia on a two-year contract in July 2012. He scored his first goal for Bahia on his debut, against his former club Flamengo.

====Later career in the U.S.====
Kléberson was acquired on loan by the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer (MLS) on 25 March 2013. He scored the game-winning goal in the 95th minute from a free kick against Toronto FC on 10 October 2013.

On 25 March 2014, Kléberson reportedly signed a two-year deal with Indy Eleven of the North American Soccer League (NASL). Kléberson was released by Indy Eleven in December 2015 after two seasons at the club.

Kléberson signed with NASL side Fort Lauderdale Strikers on 4 January 2016.

===International===
Kléberson made his first international appearance for Brazil in a friendly match against Bolivia on 31 January 2002. He also marked his debut by scoring Brazil&#x27;s fourth goal in a 6–0 win. He also scored against Iceland in March 2002. He was subsequently selected by Luiz Felipe Scolari for Brazil&#x27;s squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He was initially relegated to the bench for the first four matches in the tournament. He was brought into the starting line-up for Brazil&#x27;s game against England, with Scolari feeling his tenacity would help counter the high work-rate of the English side. His tackle on his future teammate Paul Scholes led to Brazil&#x27;s equaliser before Brazil ended up winning 2–1. He then was included in the starting lineup for the rest of the tournament. Brazil defeated Germany in the final, with Kléberson setting up one of the two Brazilian goals, as Brazil won the World Cup for a record fifth time.

After the World Cup, Kléberson retained his starting position in Brazil&#x27;s team under the new coach Carlos Alberto Parreira and was also included in Brazil&#x27;s squad for 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, where Brazil were eliminated in the group stage. That summer, Kléberson moved to Europe to join Manchester United. He failed to achieve regular playing time with his club, and as a result he lost his position in the national team. He managed to be included in Brazil&#x27;s squad for the 2004 Copa América. He made five appearances in the tournament, starting in every match he played as Brazil went on to win the tournament.

After more than four years in the international wilderness, Kléberson was recalled to the national team by Dunga on 28 May 2009. He was recalled to replace Anderson in two matches for 2010 World Cup qualification and the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa. After recovering from his shoulder surgery, once again Kléberson was called up for the national team on 9 February 2010 for a friendly match against the Republic of Ireland on 2 March in London.

Kléberson was then called up to Brazil&#x27;s 2010 World Cup squad by Dunga on 11 May. The 23-man squad was almost exactly the same as the squad against Ireland but included one additional player, Heurelho Gomes. His only appearance in the 2010 World Cup was in the round of 16 game against Chile.

==Style of play==
Kléberson was a midfielder who was known for his passing ability with either foot, which allowed him to create chances for his teammates. His playing style was based on speed, getting forward on the counterattack, and distributing the ball to other players. He was also a powerful shooter from outside the box.

==Management career==
In 2017, Kléberson rejoined the Philadelphia Union as a coach in the youth academy. In 2022, he was promoted to assistant coach of Philadelphia Union II for their inaugural season in MLS Next Pro.

==Personal life==
After Kleberson&#x27;s starring role at the 2002 World Cup, Europe&#x27;s top sides competed to sign him, but he chose to stay in Brazil for another year so he could marry his 15-year-old fiancée when she reached the age of consent, having met her when she was 14.

<text>James Clemmie Lowery (born June 26, 1974), also known as Anybody Killa, or ABK, is an American rapper from Detroit, Michigan, United States, whose stage persona is that of a Native American warrior. He was signed to Psychopathic Records, but is now under his own label Native World Inc. Prior to performing as &quot;ABK&quot; he performed as Native Funk.

==Early years (1980s)==
Lowery was raised on the east side of Detroit. His parents were from Pembroke, North Carolina. Lowery&#x27;s father was a preacher. His aunt and mother taught him about Native American heritage, telling him Cherokee and Lumbee legends and teaching him about dreamcatchers. Lowery started making music at a young age, using anything he could find as instruments, and began writing his own songs at the age of 13. By the age of 15, local kids were paying to watch him perform in his garage.

==Krazy Klan (1995)==
In 1995, he formed the group Krazy Klan with childhood friend Lavel, performing as Jaymo and J-ho, respectively. During this period, Lowery worked at a side plant that produced parts for Chrysler. His middle finger was partially cut off in an accident. After releasing two albums independently and performing at local clubs and parties, Krazy Klan broke up.

==Slangtown Records and Native Funk (2000)==
Seeking a solo career under the stage name &quot;Native Funk,&quot; Lowery released his first solo album, &quot;Rain from the Sun&quot;. After being introduced to rapper Chris Rouleau, known professionally as &quot;Blaze Ya Dead Homie,&quot; Lowery adopted the stage name &quot;Anybody Killa,&quot; and the two toured as the opening act for Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid. They also created the group Drive-By, and released their first single, &quot;Foodang&quot;.

==&quot;Hatchet Warrior&quot; era (2003)==
Lowery signed to Psychopathic Records, and recorded his second album, &quot;Hatchet Warrior&quot;, released on April 8, 2003. It peaked at #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Independent Albums chart, #42 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #98 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Allmusic&quot; reviewer Johnny Loftus wrote that &quot;Mostly, &quot;Hatchet Warrior&quot; is a rehash of [Psychopathic Records] mystique. References to Faygo abound and shout-outs to Detroit and the Juggalos are frequent, while much of ABK et al.&#x27;s raps are workmanlike run-throughs of familiar themes&quot;.

==&quot;Dirty History&quot; era (2004)==
On July 27, 2004, Lowery released his third album, &quot;Dirty History&quot;. It peaked at #7 on the Top Heatseekers chart, #10 on the Top Independent Albums, #53 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, and #152 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Lowery also joined the groups Dark Lotus and Psychopathic Rydas, performing in the latter as &quot;Sawed Off.&quot; Lowery and Rouleau also formed the group Drive-By.

==&quot;Road Fools&quot; EP era (2005)==
The EP &quot;Road Fools&quot;, released on March 22, 2005, peaked at #23 on the Top Independent Albums chart.

==Native World Inc. (2006–present)==
In 2006, Lowery left Psychopathic, continuing to release albums and merchandise from his Native World label. In 2007, Lowery performed Main Stage at the Gathering of the Juggalos, and returned to Psychopathic Records the following year. He rereleased &quot;Rain from the Sun&quot; with the &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; EP, as well as the &quot;Black Halloween&quot; EP, &quot;Orange Halloween&quot; EP, &quot;Detroit Warriors: Strike 1 Mixx&quot;, &quot;Detroit Warriors: Strike 2 Mixx&quot;, and &quot;Holiday Jingles&quot; EP in 2006.

The &quot;Devilish&quot; EP, and &quot;Frosty The Dopeman&quot; EP were released in 2007. The &quot;Perception vs Reality&quot; EP was released in 2012. ABK released the &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot; EP in 2013.

==Mudface era (2008–2009)==
ABK returned to the label in 2008, and released &quot;Mudface&quot;. The album featured Insane Clown Posse, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Strict 9, and Boondox. The pamphlet in the album advertised his upcoming album, to be called &quot;Possessed&quot;. He later revealed that the idea had been scrapped.

==&quot;Medicine Bag&quot; era (2010–2011)==
In 2010 he released his next album, titled &quot;Medicine Bag&quot;. The album featured the songs scrapped from &quot;Possessed&quot;, two on each version of the album.

==&quot;Shapeshifter&quot; era (2012–present)==
The December 21, 2012 edition of the Juggalo publication the &quot;Hatchet Herald&quot; indicated that Lowery would release a new album in 2013, which he confirmed would be titled &quot;Shapeshifter&quot;. On March 28, 2014 Anybody Killa posted on his official Twitter account that his new album was almost finished.

In the April 11, 2014 &quot;Hatchet Herald&quot;, it was announced that ABK would release a greatest hits album titled &quot;The Perfection Collection&quot; on June 10, 2014. In a June 2014 interview with YadaMedia, ABK discussed his two new albums coming out on Psychopathic Records: &quot;Shapeshifter&quot; and &quot;Road Fools 2&quot;. During his 2014 GOTJ seminar, it was announced that he and Big Hoodoo had created a new group called Tha Hav Knots, which he said might incorporate more people other than just himself and Big Hoodoo.

On May 14, 2015, on the debut edition of &quot;Hoodoo&#x27;s Hood&quot;, it was announced that ABK&#x27;s &quot;Shapeshifter&quot; would be released after Young Wicked’s debut solo album &quot;Slaughter&quot;, and before Big Hoodoo&#x27;s album in 2015. It was also announced that a third member would be added to Tha Hav Knots, speculated to be Bonez Dubb of Axe Murder Boyz.

On May 28, 2015 it was announced on &quot;The Warpath&quot; radio program that ABK would release &quot;Shapeshifter (Prelude)&quot; at the GOTJ 2015 to give the fans a taste of what the album would be like. Anybody Killa was slated to go on the &quot;Shapeshifter Tour&quot; with Big Hoodoo, Tha Hav Knots (ABK, Big Hoodoo, and Bonez Dubb of AMB) and Native World Showcase.

In an April 8, 2016 Faygoluvers interview with Violent J, it was said that Anybody Killa was waiting on Psychopathic Records, and J said that Psychopathic Records was waiting on Anybody Killa for the &quot;Shapeshifter&quot; album. On June 3, 2016, ABK announced via Twitter that he would have a new album titled &quot;The Lost War Chief Sessions&quot;, which would be available for pre-order soon on his online store, thewarriorspot.com, as it had originally been announced on March 7, 2016.

On January 1, 2017, ABK was invited to take part in the &quot;Juggalo March On Washington&quot;, he accepted on January 2 but ended up not participating due to the fact his royalty check from Psychopathic Records bounced. ABK also was featured on the Psypher &quot;Hurricane of Diamonds&quot;. On July 4, 2017 ABK released &quot;Killa Features&quot; on his own label. At the 2017 Gathering of the Juggalos, during ABK&#x27;s seminar he was asked about the status of &quot;Shapeshifter&quot; and why it has not been released, he stated &quot;beats&quot;. He elaborated in saying &quot;I had DJ Chop producing it, and then he was off the label. Then Young Wicked came in, and then he was off the label. I&#x27;ve gone through about 3 producers. Now I can either release it as it is through Native World Inc. or spend another year working on it creating new beats. What would y&#x27;all want me to do&quot;? With that question, the answer was unanimously voted for, releasing it as is, since it has taken 3 years to release it.

During ABK&#x27;s 2018 Gathering of the Juggalos seminar he announced that the new Hav Knots album is about 80% complete. He also announced that he received word from producer Brian Kuma, that &quot;Shapeshifter&quot; was 100% complete and would be released soon. He also said that he has a new release set to come out on Psychopathic Records soon, and he will be going out on tour with DJ Clay during the fall of 2018. He also mentioned that he and Blaze Ya Dead Homie plan to do a new Drive-By album and tour, but haven&#x27;t began production yet due to both of them having conflicting schedules.

On January 27, 2019 during Drive-By’s “Juggalo Unity Tour”, Anybody Killa confirmed on a Facebook livestream that &quot;Shapeshifter&quot; was finished and will be released in 2019. He also announced two more albums called &quot;Tampon Juice&quot; &amp; &quot;Always Bringing Knowledge&quot;.

On June 10, 2019, ABK announced that &quot;Tampon Juice&quot; would be released on July 26 of that same year.

==Lyrical and performance style==
Lowery&#x27;s lyrical content draws heavily from Native American imagery. He refers to his style as being &quot;like a spiritual rap&quot;. He states that &quot;I get a vibe from dreams, more or less. That&#x27;s where a lot of my writing comes from. That and a lot of my fans&#x27; personal experiences. [...] It&#x27;s their music, my fans&#x27; music. I&#x27;m just putting it to words behind lyrics for them.&quot;

In his review of &quot;Hatchet Warrior&quot;, Johnny Loftus describes the album as crossing Native American culture with gangsta rap and horror themes and humor derived from Juggalo and cannabis culture.

Lowery has a lisp, which gives him a distinctive delivery. According to Lowery, &quot;A lot of fans will say, &#x27;Oh, he&#x27;s just doing that to make it up.&#x27; Why would I want to make up a lisp while I&#x27;m rappin? I wish it was gone sometimes but a lot of people love it.&quot;

<doc id="1230816" wikidata="Q357784" url="?curid=1230816" title="Adjud">
<text>Adjud (; ) is a city in Vrancea County, Western Moldavia, Romania. It has a population of 15,178 inhabitants (as of 2021). It lies at a railway junction which has a classification yard and a passenger station. Adjud, situated north of the point where the river Trotuș enters the Siret, used to be a marketplace.

The city administers three villages: Adjudu Vechi, Burcioaia, and Șișcani.

== Geography ==
Adjud is situated on a plain and is surrounded by hills up to a height of at the foot of the Vrancea Mountains, a mountain range in the Curvature Carpathians. The average altitude of the town is above sea level. The surrounding land is favorable for agriculture.

Geological research findings show the city&#x27;s subsoil having layers of gravel and sand Levantine and Quaternary, forming significant hydrological aquifers deposits fed by the Trotuș and Siret rivers and direct rainfalls.

The climate is temperate with annual average temperature of 8– and an average rainfall of 500 mm / m a year. It is characterized by prevailing northwinds with winds from the south and south-east in the hot season. Due to its location at the junction of the provinces Moldavia, Wallachia, and Transylvania, it has been an important road and railway junction since ancient times. The town&#x27;s area was of in 1997, out of which was covered by buildings and yards.

== History ==
In the northern part of the town a settlement from the Bronze Age was discovered, which dates roughly from the second millennium BC and belongs to Monteoru culture. Geto-Dacian vestiges of 5th century BC were also found here.

The first mention of the town is made by its Hungarian name Egyedhalma (&quot;in oppido nostro &quot;Egydhalm&quot;” meaning &quot;in our city &quot;Gilles&#x27; Hill&quot;&quot;) in a Latin language document from 1433, where Iliaș of Moldavia granted commercial privileges to Transylvanian Saxon merchants. The Romanian name of Adjud derives from the Hungarian one. The original name supports the idea that the town was established by Hungarian Csángós settled in Moldavia as part of a systematic Hungarian imperial policy to settle Hungarian and partly German population in places of strategic economic, commercial and military importance with the task to control and defend the eastern frontier of Hungary.

The Battle of Adjud occurred here on 14 October 1788, during the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792), pitting the armies of the Russian Empire and the Habsburg monarchy (under the command of field marshal Baron Spleny von Mihald) against those of the Ottoman Empire.

Adjud was declared a city in 1948. In 1950 it became the residence of Adjud district from Putna Region, then (after 1952) from Bârlad Region and (after 1956) from the Bacău Region. In 1968, it became a city of Vrancea County, while in 2000 Adjud was declared a municipality.

== Population ==
At the 2021 census, Adjud had a population of 15,178. According to the 2011 census, the city had a population of 14,670, of which 13,734 (93.62%) were Romanians, and 915 (6.23%) Roma. As to religious makeup, most respondents were of the Orthodox religion (94.92%). The second largest community was the Roman Catholic one, 2.32% of the population. Pentecostals totaled 1.33%, while other denominations were represented by less than 1%.

<text>Babes in Toyland is an operetta composed by Victor Herbert with a libretto by Glen MacDonough, which wove together various characters from Mother Goose nursery rhymes into a musical extravaganza. Following the extraordinary success of their stage musical &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, which was produced in New York beginning in January 1903, producer Fred R. Hamlin and director Julian Mitchell hoped to create more family musicals. MacDonough had helped Mitchell with revisions to the &quot;Oz&quot; libretto by L. Frank Baum. Mitchell and MacDonough persuaded Victor Herbert to join the production. &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; features some of Herbert&#x27;s most famous songs – among them &quot;Toyland&quot;, &quot;March of the Toys&quot;, &quot;Go to Sleep, Slumber Deep&quot;, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Do the Sum&quot;. The theme song &quot;Toyland&quot;, and the most famous instrumental piece from the operetta, &quot;March of the Toys&quot;, occasionally show up on Christmas compilations.

The original production opened at the Grand Opera House in Chicago in June 1903, produced by Hamlin and directed by Mitchell, and toured to several East Coast cities before opening in New York in October 1903 and ran for 192 performances. This was followed by many successful tours and revivals. The piece was so popular that it spawned other &quot;fairy-tale&quot; shows over the next decade.

==Productions==

After a three-month tryout beginning on June 17, 1903, at the Grand Opera House in Chicago, followed by a tour to several East Coast cities, the original New York production opened on October 13, 1903, at the Majestic Theatre at Columbus Circle in Manhattan (where &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; had played) and closed after 192 performances on March 19, 1904. It was produced by Fred R. Hamlin and directed by Julian Mitchell. Large audiences were drawn to the musical by the spectacular settings and opulent sets (e.g., the &quot;Floral Palace of the Moth Queen&quot;, the &quot;Garden of Contrary Mary&quot;) of Toyland. The sets were designed by John H. Young and Homer Emens, with costumes designed by Caroline Siedle. In September 1904, two tours went on the road. The first-class one played a three-week return engagement beginning on January 2, 1905, at the Majestic, and then continued its tour, keeping the scenic effects and much of the original cast, and making stops in major cities for extended periods of time. The second-class tour with a reduced cast, more modest scenery, and a smaller 20-piece orchestra was streamlined for short stays on the road.

The operetta has been staged nine times at &quot;The Muny&quot;, beginning in 1920.

A Broadway revival opened on December 23, 1929, at Jolson&#x27;s 59th Street Theatre, closing on January 11, 1930, after 32 performances. It was directed by Milton Aborn. From New York the company moved on to Keith&#x27;s Theater in Philadelphia, while a second company played at the Majestic Theatre in Boston. Additional performances followed at Poli&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, D.C., and finally back at the Majestic in Chicago, for a three-week run beginning on March 26, 1930. Another Broadway revival opened on December 20, 1930, at the Imperial Theatre, closing in January 1931 after 33 performances. It was directed by Aborn and choreographed by Virginie Mauret.

A new book and lyrics for the show were written for the off-Broadway Light Opera of Manhattan (LOOM) in 1975 by Alice Hammerstein Mathias (the daughter of Oscar Hammerstein II) and the company&#x27;s director-producer William Mount-Burke. LOOM played this operetta as a Christmas show for six to eight weeks each year thereafter for 13 seasons with considerable success, and this version of the book and lyrics has since been used by various companies, including Troupe America and others. The ensemble becomes a mechanical militia of toys for the &quot;March of the Toys&quot;, and children from the audience are brought up to help &quot;wind-up&quot; the toy dancers.

In 2003, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the operetta, Hampton, Virginia–based Rainbow Puppet Productions created a touring puppet version of the show entitled &quot;Toyland!&quot; The new script was adapted by David Messick Jr. Prerecorded puppet voices were created, featuring Mickey Rooney as the Master Toymaker and his wife Jan Rooney as Mother Goose. The program has toured annually since that time. In this version, Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep, and her evil Uncle Barnaby is to blame. She travels through the Spider Forest to seek help from the kind Master Toymaker.

==Plot synopsis==
===1903 version===

Orphans Alan and Jane are the wards of their wicked Uncle Barnaby, who wants to steal their inheritance. He arranges with two sailors, Gonzorgo and Roderigo, for them to be shipwrecked and lost at sea, but they are rescued by gypsies and returned to Contrary Mary&#x27;s garden. Contrary Mary, the eldest daughter of the Widow Piper, believing her beloved Alan is dead, has run away with her brother, Tom-Tom, rather than agree to marry Barnaby. After a second attempt on their lives, Alan and Jane are abandoned in the Forest of No Return. In the Spider&#x27;s Den, they are protected by the Moth Queen. Old Mother Hubbard&#x27;s shoe is threatened with foreclosure by Barnaby.

Alan and Jane arrive in Toyland, where they find Contrary Mary and Tom-Tom and seek protection from the Master Toymaker, an evil genius who plots with Barnaby to create toys that kill and maim. The demonically possessed dolls turn on the Toymaker, killing him, and Barnaby uses the information to have Alan sentenced to death. Contrary Mary agrees to marry Barnaby in exchange for Alan&#x27;s pardon, but after he marries her, Barnaby denounces Alan again. Barnaby dies after drinking a wine glass filled with poison meant for Alan. Tom-Tom reveals that an old law of Toyland permitting marriage between a widow and a condemned man on condition that he supports her may save Alan from the gallows. Alan is now free to marry Contrary Mary.

===1970s version===
A new version, first produced in 1975 by the Light Opera of Manhattan with the support of the Victor Herbert Foundation, is more sentimental than the original. Two unhappy children, Jane and Alan, run away from home. Their parents, who are always putting work and discipline before fun, are too busy for them, so the young siblings set out for a place where they will be understood. The children believe that Toyland, a magical land of spirited toys, will deliver them from their hardships. When they arrive, the kindly Toymaker welcomes them with open arms. He warns them not to become too caught up in the fantasy, but soon the toys of Toyland draw them in with their singing and dancing.

The busy parents must find a way to bring the young runaways back home. They send a private eye to search for their children, but this detective sees an opportunity for personal gain in his trip to Toyland; he forces Jane and Alan to help him steal the Toymaker&#x27;s plans for a new marching toy soldier. When the parents arrive in Toyland via hot air balloon, they too fall under the spell of the mystical land. Arguments break out, toys are wounded, and Jane and Alan get lost and frightened in the dark woods outside of Toyland. As the parents and toys search for the children, the characters and audience alike discover the true meaning of Christmas.
==Recordings==
Herbert&#x27;s Victor Herbert Orchestra recorded selections from &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; in 1911–1912 for the Victor Talking Machine Company as single releases, including &quot;March of the Toys&quot;, &quot;The Toymaker&#x27;s Shop&quot; and &quot;The Military Ball&quot;. Decca Records recorded ten selections from the score (on five 10-inch 78-RPM records) in 1944. The recording featured Kenny Baker and Karen Kemple with a chorus and orchestra conducted by Alexander Smallens. This album was reissued on a 10-inch LP in 1949, and by reducing the selections from ten to six, Decca re-released it on one side of a 12-inch LP (&quot;The Red Mill&quot; was on the reverse) in 1957. Decca Broadway reissued the complete album on CD (again paired with &quot;The Red Mill&quot;) in 2002.

The Walt Disney film version, released in 1961, was given two recordings released in the same year. The first was a cover version featuring only Ed Wynn and Ann Jillian from the film, supported by a cast of singers unidentified on the album. This version was released by Disneyland Records. The second used the original vocal tracks from the soundtrack of the film; however, the musical accompaniments and choral arrangements were not those heard in the film, but those heard on the cover version. This album was released on Buena Vista Records and features Wynn, Jillian, Ray Bolger, Henry Calvin, Kevin Corcoran, Annette Funicello and Tommy Sands. Neither one of these albums has been issued on CD.

A stereo recording was made by Reader&#x27;s Digest for their 1962 album &quot;Treasury of Great Operettas&quot;. Each of the 24 operettas in the set is condensed to fill one LP side. The recording was conducted by Lehman Engel. A 1963 recording of several of the songs was released together with numbers from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1963 MGM Studio Cast). A shortened version of the operetta was released in 1977. A compilation album was released on CD in 1997. The &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; recording was released on CD in 2012.

A recording of the complete score, with the original orchestrations restored and conducted by John McGlinn with the London Sinfonietta and the London Voices, was made in 2001. It featured Hugh Panaro as Alan, Korliss Uecker as Jane, Ian Richardson as Barnaby, Valerian Ruminski as Gonzorgo, Elizabeth Futral as Contrary Mary, Rebecca Caine as Tom-Tom and Ian McKellen as the Master Toymaker. It has never been released. A cast recording of the 2003 Rainbow Puppet Productions production of &quot;Toyland!&quot; was released in 2007, featuring the voice of Mickey Rooney as the Master Toymaker. His wife, Jan Rooney, plays Mother Goose.

==Adaptations==

===Children&#x27;s book===
A 1904 children&#x27;s book of the same name by Glen MacDonough and Anna Alice Chapin, with illustrations by Ethel Franklin Betts, is based on the operetta.

===Films===
In April 1930, RKO Pictures purchased the screen rights to &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot;, planning a lavish production to be supervised by William LeBaron and filmed partly in two-strip Technicolor. The cast was reported to include Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey, Irene Dunne, Dorothy Lee, Joseph Cawthorn, Edna May Oliver and Ned Sparks. But the widening Great Depression, together with the box office failure of the expensive RKO musical &quot;Dixiana&quot; and the saturation of the market with film musicals in general, led the studio to suspend production in August 1930, and the film was never made. Hal Roach purchased the screen rights from RKO in November 1933, and on November 29, 1934, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the Roach studio version of &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; (later reissued as &quot;March of the Wooden Soldiers&quot;), with a new plot and retaining only five of Herbert&#x27;s songs. The film starred Laurel and Hardy, Felix Knight as Tom-Tom, Charlotte Henry as Little Bo-Peep, and Henry Brandon as Silas Barnaby.

Walt Disney&#x27;s Technicolor 1961 film production starred Bolger, Sands, Funicello, Jillian, Calvin, Gene Sheldon and Ed Wynn. This had a heavily revised plot and new lyrics, but much of the Herbert music was included, although often in altered tempi, and many of the original characters still appeared in the story. A stage version of &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot;, with a plotline similar to the Disney film has a book by Rebecca Ryland and music and lyrics by Bill Francoeur.

An animated film version, with a new plot and only one of the original songs, was released in 1997 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer featuring the voices of Christopher Plummer, James Belushi, Bronson Pinchot and Lacey Chabert.

===Television===
Between 1950 and 1960, there were at least three television versions of &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot;, all broadcast by NBC during the Christmas season. A 1950 version starred Edith Fellows, Robert Weede, and Gil Lamb; Dennis King played a new villain called Dr. Electron. A 1954 adaptation, restaged in 1955, was directed by Max Liebman and starred Jo Sullivan (1954) and Barbara Cook (1955) as Jane and Dennis Day as Tommy, as well as Wally Cox as Grumio, Dave Garroway as Santa, Karin Wolfe as Ann (Jane&#x27;s little sister) and Jack E. Leonard as Barnaby. Bambi Linn and Rod Alexander were featured dancers, and the production incorporated the Bil Baird marionettes.

A 1960 adaptation for television, produced by William Asher, featured Shirley Temple as the old gypsy Floretta, Angela Cartwright as Jane, Jonathan Winters as Barnaby, and Jerry Colonna, Joe Besser, and Carl Ballantine as his henchmen Gonzales, Roderigo, and Gonzorgo. It was shown as an episode of the anthology series &quot;The Shirley Temple Show&quot;. The script was written by Jack Brooks and Sheldon Keller, who also contributed a new song. Unlike most of the earlier film and television adaptations, this version retained many elements the original operetta&#x27;s plot, focusing on the orphans&#x27; escape from their cruel uncle.

A 1986 made for television version featured Drew Barrymore, Pat Morita and Keanu Reeves, only two songs from the Victor Herbert score, a new plot, and many new songs by Leslie Bricusse.

<doc id="1230828" wikidata="Q3987840" url="?curid=1230828" title="The Knickerbockers">
<text>The Knickerbockers were an American garage rock band formed in Bergenfield, New Jersey in 1964. They released the 1965 hit &quot;Lies&quot;, which was known for its resemblance to the Beatles. The band was formed in 1964 by the brothers Beau Charles (guitar and vocals) and John Charles (bass and vocals) (birth names: Robert and John Carlos Cecchino respectively)

== History ==
=== Formation ===
The Charles brothers played with a fluctuating personnel until 1964, when they met Buddy Randell (vocals and sax) (birth name: William Crandall). Randell was previously of the Rockin&#x27; Saints and The Royal Teens, who had a hit with &quot;Short Shorts&quot; in 1958. They took their name from Knickerbocker Road (County Route 505), which runs through Tenafly, the next town to the east of Bergenfield.

The classic line-up consisted of Randell, the Charles brothers, and drummer Jimmy Walker (previously the drummer with the Massena, New York-based Atco Records act The Castle Kings). They were spotted by producer and singer-songwriter Jerry Fuller playing the University Twist Palace in Albany, New York, and he signed them to Los Angeles-based Challenge Records.

=== Initial success ===

Throughout The Knickerbockers&#x27; three years of recordings, the group tirelessly pursued current trends; the vocals on &quot;Jerk Town&quot;, for example, are heavily derivative of the Four Seasons. Furthermore, the song&#x27;s lyrics refer to &quot;hot rods&quot;, like many other popular songs of the day. The group had a top-20 hit in 1965 with &quot;Lies&quot;, on which the group emulated the Beatles&#x27; harmonies and playing so perfectly that the record was often passed off to the unsuspecting as an actual Beatles cut.

The follow-up to &quot;Lies&quot; was &quot;One Track Mind&quot;, which was nearly a hit as well. However, the band&#x27;s label, Challenge Records, could not handle the distribution, and the single only reached number 45. The Knickerbockers soldiered on, appearing in the movie &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1966) and as regulars on Dick Clark&#x27;s ABC-TV program, &quot;Where the Action Is&quot; (1965–1967).

=== Decline ===
Though the band had a strong songwriter in Beau Charles, they were hampered by their label&#x27;s ineptness, and drummer Walker left in late 1968 to replace Bill Medley in The Righteous Brothers. Walker also recorded three solo singles for Columbia Records in 1968–1969, before retiring to Wyoming for much of the 1970s. Buddy Randell was the next to depart. The Charles brothers kept the band going by adding new members Richie Walker (vocals), Eric Swanson (drums), and Barry McCoy (keyboards). Randell rejoined The Knickerbockers on drums in 1968, leaving again in 1970 (McCoy departed to join Gary Puckett &amp; The Union Gap). Randell later recorded singles for Uni Records (&quot;Randi, Randi&quot;/&quot;Be My Baby&quot; 1970) and under aliases such as Steel Wool (&quot;No Sugar Tonight&quot;, White Whale 1969) and Blowtorch (&quot;I Want Sugar all the Time&quot; Paramount Records 1971). Beau Charles was also active outside of the group, recording &quot;Sharon Stay in Birmingham&quot; for White Whale Records under the alias of Columbus Jones in 1969. (Both of the White Whale and Uni Records singles were produced or co-produced by George Tobin, who later went on to produce and manage 1980s teenage singer Tiffany).

=== Other projects and reformation ===
Beau and John Charles, along with singer Ritchie Costanza and drummer Eric Swanson, were signed to Motown records in 1971, where their name was changed to Lodi, after another Bergen County town; Lodi is located somewhat southwest of Bergenfield. They recorded an album (released in 1972) and one single (&quot;Happiness&quot; / &quot;I Hope I See it In My Lifetime&quot;) on the Mowest subsidiary, before splitting up.

The Charles brothers, Randell, and Swanson then briefly backed up Playboy Records artist Brenda Patterson in 1973–1974, most notably appearing on an episode of &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;. Beau Charles remained the most visible member of the band throughout the 1970s, appearing in an episode of &quot;Harry-O&quot; as a lounge singer, and performing on various film and television soundtracks.

Since then, The Knickerbockers have reformed twice. The first time was in 1983 in Los Angeles, with everyone except Buddy Randell (he was singing with the faith-based band Jerusalem Rivers at the time). They recorded demos with producer Jerry Fuller, but split up soon afterward. The band reformed one more time, performing for a month in Delray Beach, Florida, in 1990, before disbanding again.

The band&#x27;s two most popular singles are on the box set &quot;&quot;, and there are numerous re-issues and rarity sets. A compilation album by the band is &quot;The Fabulous Knickerbockers&quot;, released on Sundazed Music. Beau and John Charles have been involved with The Knickerbockers&#x27; CD releases on Sundazed Music.

Saxophonist Buddy Randell died in 1998. Drummer Jimmy Walker died in 2020.

<doc id="1230829" wikidata="Q5531011" url="?curid=1230829" title="Gender roles in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica">
<text>Gender roles existed in Mesoamerica, with a sexual division of labour meaning that women took on many domestic tasks including child-rearing and food preparation while only men were typically allowed to use weapons and assume positions of leadership. Both men and women farmed, but in some societies, women were not permitted to plough the fields because it was believed to symbolise men&#x27;s role in the reproductive cycle.

Evidence also suggests the existence of gender ambiguity and fluidity in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations. Gender relations and functions also varied among Mesoamerican cultures and societies over time and depending on social status. Mesoamerica or Meso-America (Spanish: Mesoamérica) is a region and culture area in the Americas, extending approximately from central Mexico to Honduras and Nicaragua, within which a number of pre-Columbian societies flourished before the Spanish colonization of the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries. The stereotype that women play a minimal role in the family is far from accurate. Although women&#x27;s roles in agriculture have been underestimated, if it were not for the contributions of women in agriculture, the family would not survive.

With the arrival of the Spanish and their subsequent viceregal rule starting in the 16th century, Mesoamerican gender relations could no longer be considered distinct cultural practices. Gender roles and gender relations instead became subject to the practices of Spanish viceregal rule and the caste system. However, despite suppression by Spanish colonialization, aspects of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican gender roles have survived in indigenous communities to this day.

== Roles ==
=== Labor ===
Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican arts contain evidence of a gendered division of labor, depicting women engaged in domestic labor such as weaving, childrearing, tending to animals, and giving birth. Weaving was more strongly associated with gender for the Classic Mexica than the Classic Maya, for which it indicated class. Men were depicted with weapons and in positions of religious and political authority. While evidence suggests that farming was seen as a male activity, the gendered divisions of labor may not have been so strict. Analysis of the bones of women revealed evidence of wear patterns strongly associated with the repetitive motion of grinding maize, suggesting women were primarily engaged in that labor. Anthropologists such as Miranda Stockett believe it is likely that men, women, and children all participated in farming and domestic labor to varying degrees.

Women also hold a variety of roles within the family. These range from harvesting the grains and preparing the food for the family to taking care of the domesticated animals. When examining the role women play in planting and harvesting, one notices that this area still holds some stereotypes about how women aid their husbands. In some societies, women are responsible for sowing and harvesting crops but are restricted from ploughing. The roles shared between men and women in agriculture in Santa Rosa, Yucatán. Although women are allocated such tasks as sowing, with all its association with fertility, they are rigidly excluded from ploughing. The significance of not allowing women to plough is related to human reproduction. The common belief is that women should not be able to plough because it invades the male&#x27;s role in human reproduction. Thus, men are able to carry out all stages of the agriculture cycle, including the planting of the seed, while women—even in their role as head of the household—are sanctioned to rely upon men for particular tasks. The reasoning behind limiting women&#x27;s roles in the production of the crops is directly related to reproduction. Women rely on men for some tasks when planting crops, just as women need the assistance of men in reproduction.

Aside from producing food, another important task that women carry out is food preparation, which demands the most attention because the women must sit by the hearth for long periods of time. In the role women have in the preparation of maize, after the grains have been harvested, the next step is to process them so the family can consume them. Apart from childbearing and childrearing, one of the women&#x27;s foremost duties was the processing of dried corn into maize flour. After being boiled with lime, softened maize kernels were ground with a tubular hand stone on a flat grinding stone (metate) into maize dough. Once the dough is formed, a variety of food items can be made. Here the metate plays an important role in the processing of maize, the staple crop of the culture.

Women play an important role in the survival of their families because the family survives from the work they perform in the corral.

Additionally, the success of Mesoamerican rituals was dependent on the production of food and textiles, to which women contributed much labor. These rituals were vital to ensuring good relationships with not only the gods but also within communities. In &quot;Relación de las cosas de Yucatán,&quot; Diego de Landa observed that for nearly all rituals, Mayan women were responsible for preparing food for both offerings and consumption in addition to the cloth as offerings.

Gender relations among the Mexica also suggested gender complementarity. For example, dying in battle and dying in childbirth elevated men and women respectively. In childbirth, women confront the goddess Cihuacoatl, and if they died, their bodies were considered temporarily imbued with the power of the goddess. Since parts of their bodies could be used as a protective amulet or to curse others, the husband kept vigil by her body for four nights.

In regards to specific Mesoamerican midwives, Aztec midwives were known as the tlamatlquicitl. These midwives provided unique ways of giving birth which involved medical assistance, analgesics or pain relief medications, and religious rituals. For pregnant Aztec women, their part of the pregnancy included some kind of ritual and was also defined by the hygiene they had. Most midwives, including Mayan ones, were actually all similar when it came to focusing on childbirth.

=== Art and Culture ===
Upper class Aztec society allowed both men and women to be writers, artists, and textile workers. Courtiers of both genders wrote poetry extolling the sovereign&#x27;s military strength and conquest. One such poet is Macuilxochitzin, the daughter of a prominent noble family. Women could also work as professional artisans and textile workers.

=== Politics ===
Some Mesoamerican women were able to assume roles as political leaders, such as women in Maya society, others such as women in Mexica society were not. However while Mexican women couldn&#x27;t serve in this capacity, they were given equal legal and economic rights and noble Mexican women could become priestesses. Additionally, two influential political figures headed the highest levels of the Mexican government. One was the &quot;tlatoani&quot;, literally &quot;the one who speaks&quot;, and another was the &quot;cihuacoatl&quot;, meaning &quot;woman snake&quot;, both representing a male&amp;female pair. The &quot;tlatoani&quot; were responsible for military affairs and the &quot;cihuacoatl&quot; was responsible for domestic affairs like the food supply and administering justice. The position of &quot;cihuacoatl&quot; was in reality occupied by a man, but the associations with femininity were significant enough that the &quot;cihuacoatl&quot;, of the same name as a goddess, wore a women&#x27;s dress for ceremonies. As Mesoamerican states became more centralized over time, men&#x27;s power became more associated with their control over women and their capacity for productive and reproductive labor. As a result, opportunities available to women became limited. In the case of Mexico, military concerns may have eclipsed women&#x27;s public significance.

=== Gender ambiguity ===
Although pre-Columbian Mesoamerican art contained depictions of the body as male or female as represented by genitalia or secondary sex characteristics, it also included representations of bodies with exposed chests and waists but no visible sexual characteristics. Depictions of rituals conducted by elite Mesoamericans have included women dressed in the traditional costume of men and men dressed in the traditional costume of women.

<doc id="1230835" wikidata="Q2041271" url="?curid=1230835" title="Sequence point">
<text>In C and C++, a sequence point defines any point in a computer program&#x27;s execution at which it is guaranteed that all side effects of previous evaluations will have been performed, and no side effects from subsequent evaluations have yet been performed. They are a core concept for determining the validity of and, if valid, the possible results of expressions. Adding more sequence points is sometimes necessary to make an expression defined and to ensure a single valid order of evaluation.

With C11 and C++11, usage of the term sequence point has been replaced by sequencing. There are three possibilities:

#An expression&#x27;s evaluation can be &quot;sequenced before&quot; that of another expression, or equivalently the other expression&#x27;s evaluation is &quot;sequenced after&quot; that of the first.
#The expressions&#x27; evaluation is &quot;indeterminately sequenced,&quot; meaning one is sequenced before the other, but which is unspecified.
#The expressions&#x27; evaluation is &quot;unsequenced.&quot;

The execution of unsequenced evaluations can overlap, leading to potentially catastrophic undefined behavior if they share state. This situation can arise in parallel computations, causing race conditions, but undefined behavior can also result in single-threaded situations. For example, codice_1 (where is an array and is an integer) has undefined behavior.

==Examples of ambiguity==
Consider two functions codice_2 and codice_3. In C and C++, the codice_4 operator is not associated with a sequence point, and therefore in the expression codice_5 it is possible that either codice_2 or codice_3 will be executed first. The comma operator introduces a sequence point, and therefore in the code codice_8 the order of evaluation is defined: first codice_2 is called, and then codice_3 is called.

Sequence points also come into play when the same variable is modified more than once within a single expression. An often-cited example is the C expression codice_11, which apparently both assigns codice_12 its previous value and increments codice_12. The final value of codice_12 is ambiguous, because, depending on the order of expression evaluation, the increment may occur before, after, or interleaved with the assignment. The definition of a particular language might specify one of the possible behaviors or simply say the behavior is undefined. In C and C++, evaluating such an expression yields undefined behavior. Other languages, such as C#, define the precedence of the assignment and increment operator in such a way that the result of the expression codice_11 is guaranteed.

==Behavior==

=== Up to C++03 ===

In C and C++, sequence points occur in the following places. (In C++, overloaded operators act like functions, and thus operators that have been overloaded introduce sequence points in the same way as function calls.)

#Between evaluation of the left and right operands of the codice_16 (logical AND), codice_17 (logical OR) (as part of short-circuit evaluation), and comma operators. For example, in the expression , all side effects of the sub-expression are completed before any attempt to access .
#Between the evaluation of the first operand of the ternary conditional operator and its second or third operand. For example, in the expression there is a sequence point after the first , meaning it has already been incremented by the time the second instance is executed.
#At the end of a full expression. This category includes expression statements (such as the assignment ), return statements, the controlling expressions of , , , or - statements, and each of the three expressions in a codice_18 statement.
#Before a function is entered in a function call. The order in which the arguments are evaluated is not specified, but this sequence point means that all of their side effects are complete before the function is entered. In the expression , is called with a parameter of the original value of , but is incremented before entering the body of . Similarly, and are updated before entering and respectively. However, it is not specified in which order , , are executed, nor in which order , , are incremented. If the body of accesses the variables and , it might find both, neither, or just one of them to have been incremented. (The function call is &quot;not&quot; a use of the comma operator; the order of evaluation for , , and is unspecified.)
#At a function return, after the return value is copied into the calling context. (This sequence point is only specified in the C++ standard; it is present only implicitly in C.)
#At the end of an initializer; for example, after the evaluation of in the declaration .
#Between each declarator in each declarator sequence; for example, between the two evaluations of in . (This is &quot;not&quot; an example of the comma operator.)
#After each conversion associated with an input/output format specifier. For example, in the expression , there is a sequence point after the is evaluated and before printing .

=== C11 and C++11 ===

Partially because of the introduction of language support for threads, C11 and C++11 introduced new terminology for evaluation order. An operation may be &quot;sequenced before&quot; another, or the two can be &quot;indeterminately&quot; sequenced (one must complete before the other) or &quot;unsequenced&quot; (the operations in each expression may be interleaved).

=== C++17 ===

C++17 restricted several aspects of evaluation order. The expression will always perform the memory allocation before evaluating the constructor arguments. The operators , , , , , and the subscript and function call operator are guaranteed to be evaluated left to right (whether they are overloaded or not). For example, the code
std::cout « a() « b() « c(); // parsed as (((std::cout « a()) « b()) « c());
is newly guaranteed to call , and in that order. The right-hand side of any assignment-like operator is evaluated before the left-hand side, so that codice_19 is guaranteed to evaluate first. Finally, although the order in which function parameters are evaluated remains implementation-defined, the compiler is no longer allowed to interleave &quot;sub-expressions&quot; across multiple parameters.

<text>The Strike Fighter Squadron 87 (VFA-87) is a United States Navy strike fighter squadron based at Naval Air Station Oceana. The squadron is equipped with the Boeing F/A-18E Super Hornet and is nicknamed the &quot;Golden Warriors&quot;, its call sign is &quot;War Party&quot;. Currently, the squadron is assigned to Carrier Air Wing 8 (tail code &quot;AJ&quot;).

==Insignia and Nickname==
The squadron’s insignia and nickname were approved by CNO on 29 July 1968 and have remained essentially unchanged.

==History==

===1960s===
In June 1968, the squadron was established as VA-87, an attack aircraft squadron and the first fleet squadron to fly the LTV A-7 Corsair II, at NAS Cecil Field, Florida. In March 1969, the squadron flew its first combat missions from , striking targets in South Vietnam. In April 1969 following the shoot down of a Navy EC-121 Warning Star aircraft by the North Koreans, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;, with VA-87 embarked, was ordered to the Sea of Japan.

===1970s===
In the 1970s, VA-87 made 12 deployments aboard three different carriers—, and .

In 1973, the squadron protected U.S. interests during the Yom Kippur War. Transitioning to the improved A-7E Corsair II, the squadron returned in October 1976 to the Middle East following the assassination of the American ambassador to Lebanon Francis E. Meloy Jr, assisting in the evacuation of U.S. citizens, while embarked on &quot;America&quot;.

===1980s===

During the Iran hostage crisis and the Israeli-Syrian disputes of 1981, VA-87 deployed to the region for 195 days aboard &quot;Independence&quot;. One year later the squadron returned, supporting U.S. peacekeeping operations in Lebanon.

In October 1983, the squadron participated in Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada. During the same deployment, VA-87 participated in strikes against Syria in response to hostile fire against U.S. reconnaissance aircraft from Syrian positions in Lebanon.

On 24 October 1986, the squadron transitioned to the F/A-18A Hornet and was redesignated Strike Fighter Squadron 87 (VFA-87).

===1990s===

On 28 December 1990, following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the squadron deployed for Operation Desert Storm, flying 629 sorties over 43 days of intense combat.

The squadron, equipped with the newer F/A-18C, deployed to the Adriatic Sea and Red Sea from March to September 1993, flying hundreds of missions in support of United Nations Operation Deny Flight, Operation Provide Comfort and Operation Southern Watch. Embarked for the last time on &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, VFA-87 returned in March 1995 to Southwest Asia for a month to participate in Operation Southern Watch.

Following a hasty transit to the Adriatic, the squadron spent four months flying combat sorties over the increasingly embattled former Yugoslavia. On 30 August 1995, squadron jets were the first to strike Bosnian Serb targets as the Operation Deliberate Force campaign commenced.

VFA-87 again headed to the Adriatic to fly over Bosnia-Herzegovina in support of Operation Deliberate Guard and again in Operation Southern Watch before coming home in October 1997 to Naval Air Station Cecil Field for the last time in the squadron’s history. The squadron was forced to relocate to NAS Oceana, in Virginia Beach, Virginia from NAS Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Florida due to a 1993 post-Cold War Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) decision mandating the closure of NAS Cecil Field by 1 Oct 1999.

The Golden Warriors made history again by participating in combat operations in two different theaters during a single deployment, operating from . While en route to the Persian Gulf in April 1999, crisis erupted in the former Yugoslavian republic of Kosovo, prompting the largest aerial bombing campaign since the Vietnam War. In just 68 days, Golden Warrior FA-18s dropped 430,000 pounds of ordnance and flew 595 combat missions during Operation ALLIED FORCE, contributing to a NATO victory, and expelling Serbian oppressors from the war-torn province of Kosovo. In July, VFA-87 returned to the Persian Gulf and flew 176 combat missions in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. The Golden Warriors returned to their first new home in over thirty years, NAS Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

===2000s===
In April 2001, VFA-87 deployed on a Persian Gulf cruise enforcing the no fly zone over Southern Iraq aboard until the September 11 attacks occurred. The squadron was then held on station along with the entire &quot;Enterprise&quot; battle group, to conduct first strike combat missions over Afghanistan against embedded Taliban targets. VFA-87 returned to NAS Oceana in November 2001.

====Iraq and Afghanistan====
In January 2003, USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; battle group along with VFA-87 conducted combat operations over Iraq, initiating Operation Iraqi Freedom.

VFA-87 deployed again in September 2005 aboard &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, returning on 11 March 2006, and received the Atlantic Fleet &quot;Battle E&quot; award later that year.

In September 2006, the squadron transitioned from the F/A-18C to the F/A-18A+ and was again named the &quot;Battle E&quot; squadron for the Atlantic Fleet in March 2007. It deployed again in September 2008 to the North Arabian Sea, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and returned home to NAS Oceana on 18 April 2009.

===2010s===
2010 was a year of significant accomplishment for the squadron. VFA-87 participated in three embarked periods in preparation for the maiden deployment of , including a deck qualification, Independent Steaming Exercise (ISE), and Tailored Ship&#x27;s Training Assessment (TSTA). Additionally the &quot;War Party&quot; completed three command detachments; one to NAS Key West for the Air-to-Air Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP) and two to NAS Fallon for Air-to-Ground SFARP.

In May 2011, VFA-87 departed on a deployment aboard USS &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot;. While deployed the squadron flew combat missions in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and New Dawn flying over Afghanistan and Iraq respectively in support of combat troops on the ground.

In 2012 VFA-87 successfully completed four operational detachments, transitioned back to the F/A-18C by transferring 10 F/A-18A+ and accepting 11 F/A-18C aircraft. The squadron made another deployment aboard &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; to the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean from February to November 2014. Following this deployemnt, VFA-87 converted to the F/A-18E Super Hornet.

====Syria====
VFA-87 made a single deployment aboard USS &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; from January to August 2017. During this desployment, Lieutenant Commander Michael Tremel, flying a VFA-87 F/A-18E shot down a Syrian Su-22 after multiple observed ROE violations on 18 June 2017. The Su-22 had been bombing US-backed forces fighting the Islamic State.

===2020s===

After having been assigned to CVW-8 since 1988, VFA-87 was re-assigned to Carrier Air Wing 11 in 2020. The squadron made two deployments aboard to the Western Pacific from January and July 2020 and from December to May 2021. Following these deployments, the squadron returned to CVW-8. In 2021, CVW-8 was re-assigned to .

<text>.tr is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Turkey. It is administered by trABİS (under the Information and Communication Technologies Authority of Turkey) and managed by the Computer Center DNS Group of the ICT Authority. The domain was formerly administered by NIC.tr and managed by the Turkey Internet Society (the local chapter of ISOC) until September 2022.

== Statistics ==

As of March 2017, around 15.53% of all the .tr domains were served via secured HTTPS protocol, with the Let&#x27;s Encrypt Authority X3 being the most popular SSL certificate. Microsoft-IIS is the most popular web server, serving 35.31% of the .tr domains, followed by Apache serving 35.14% of the total .tr domains.

== History ==
.nic.tr, formerly the official registry&#x27;s domain, was closed on 12 September 2022. Since then domain management is only possible via accredited registrars. The registry TRABIS is also a registrar but only for restricted SLDs like gov.tr. Additionally com.tr, org.tr and net.tr can be registered without additional documents since this date.

== Domains ==

=== Second-level ===
In 2023 the registry started a 3-phase launch process with different priorities of current SLD registrants to apply for the second level variant. On 7 August 2024 the third phase ended, since then domains are allocated first-come first-served.

==== .ct.tr and .nc.tr ====
.ct.tr and .nc.tr are the second level domain names of Northern Cyprus. Because Northern Cyprus is a unrecognised state, it does not have a top-level domain and uses .tr, the top-level domain name of Turkey. Infrastructure has been created for the future spread of the domain names, which only hosts the websites of some Turkish Cypriot state institutions. ct.tr hosts 44 websites, while nc.tr is never used except for two websites, one of which is a duplicate version of the Republican Assembly&#x27;s ct.tr version. That has two versions: One that has https, which is expired, and one without it, which is faster than the ct.tr version. The other website is the searching feature of the Republican Assembly.

<text>The Córas Iompair Éireann 001 Class locomotive was manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers at their Dukinfield Works in Manchester. The 001 Class locomotive was the backbone of mainline passenger and freight train services on the Irish railway network for forty years from 1955 until the mid-1990s when they were replaced by the new 201 Class.

==Engines==

===Crossley===
Initially they were fitted with eight-cylinder two-stroke, port-controlled Crossley engines. These were a loop scavenge type, which utilised a patented principle that recycled the normally wasted exhaust-pressure pulse to boost charge air in the cylinder. They produced at 625 rpm and could do . The original sandboxes, which were used to improve traction with the rail, were removed after a few years.

Their Crossley engines proved to be notoriously unreliable from the start. Amongst a plethora of problems were:
* Unbalanced engines resulting in vibration-induced fuel pipe and water pipe fractures
* Cylinder defects
* Excessive water temperature causing shutdowns

There were also problems with generator and motor flashovers.

Similar problems were also encountered on the Crossley-engined Western Australian Government Railways X Class and British Rail Class 28 locomotives.

===EMD===
These problems were tackled between 1968 and 1971 through the progressive re-engining of the entire class with a 12-cylinder EMD 645E engine (a similar process was implemented for the original 201 Class). However, this power output stressed the ability of the original cooling and transmission systems and the engine output was reduced to for improved reliability. When built, these locomotives were originally numbered A1 to A60, and as locomotives were re-engined, they had the suffix &#x27;R&#x27; added to their number. From 1972, the prefix letters were dropped and the locomotives were renumbered 001 to 060.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 5 December 1963, locomotive A17 was hauling a passenger train from Westland Row to Westport when it broke down at Mullingar, County Westmeath. Locomotive A42 was sent to its assistance, but collided with the stationary train at a speed of . Both locomotives were damaged, 16 people were injured.
*On 23 October 1973, 008 suffered bomb damage at Meigh.
*On 20 December 1978, 010 collided with three NIR vehicles at Lisburn.
*On 21 April 1979, 046 suffered bomb damage at Killeen Bridge (near Newtowncloghoge).
*On 23 July 1979, 004 was hijacked, derailed and burnt out at Goraghwood.
*On 12 March 1983, 032 sustained damage after running away in Cork Yard.
*On 2 June 1988, 040 sustained damage in a shunting accident at Heuston station.

==Preservation==
Four A class locomotives survived into preservation, the details of which are outlined in the table below:

==Model==
The A Class is available as a 4mm scale (OO) ready-to-run (RTR) model from Irish Railway Models. Announced in October 2018, it was released in October 2021. In the past it has been made as a 00 gauge kit by Silver Fox Models.

<text>Săcele (; German: &quot;Siebendörfer&quot;; Hungarian: &quot;Négyfalu&quot;, between 1950 and 2001 &quot;Szecseleváros&quot;) is a city in Brașov County, Romania, in the Burzenland area of southeastern Transylvania, with a population of 30,920 inhabitants in 2021. It is adjacent to the city of Brașov, its city centre being situated away from downtown Brașov.

==History==
The city since 1950 is composed of former villages which now form the main sectors: Baciu (Bácsfalu, Batschendorf), Turcheș (Türkös, Türkeschdorf), Cernatu (Csernátfalu, Zerndorf), and Satulung (Hosszúfalu, Langendorf). After the second half of the 11th century the villages were mentioned as &quot;&quot;septem villae valacheles&quot; (seven Vlach villages).

The first official mention of Săcele was a document issued on May 16, 1366, by the Hungarian King Louis I of Hungary in which he offers the area between the Timiș and Olt rivers to a trusted friend—Count Stanislav. Later it was under the Saxon management of Kronstadt (Brașov). Between the 13th and 14th centuries, an important Hungarian population settled in the region, marking the further development of the area.

During the Middle Ages three other villages belonged to the locality: Tărlungeni, Zizin, and Cărpiniș.

The Romanian name &quot;Săcele&quot; was first mentioned in a letter between the Wallachian Prince Vlad Călugărul (1482–1495) and the magistrate of Brașov. The Romanian etymology of &quot;Săcele&quot; is from &quot;sătucele&quot; meaning &quot;small villages&quot;&quot;.

The German name was &quot;Siebendörfen&quot; which means &quot;seven villages&quot; and which is close to the Hungarian name &quot;Hétfalu&quot; or &quot;Négyfalu&quot;. See also Seven Villages.

The inhabitants were the Mocani—local shepherds. They are mentioned in a few official documents and appear to have owned thousands of sheep, the villages being among the wealthiest in the area. They carried the local traditions across many Romanian lands due to the transhumance method of shepherding. Their customs exist to these days: the &quot;Sîntilie&quot; (Saint Elijah) festival, national costumes, etc.

After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the city diversified its economy. In Săcele there are nowadays several small furniture factories, lumber-mills, as well as meat-packaging facilities.

==Climate==
Săcele has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).

==Buildings and monuments==
The city has 17 churches of the following denominations: Orthodox, Lutheran, Reformed, Roman Catholic.

The Orthodox Baciu Church, Turcheș Church, Cernatu Church and, in Satulung, the Dormition and Archangels churches are historic monuments.

There is a copy of the Capitoline Wolf in Săcele.

==Education==
Săcele houses two highs schools: the George Moroianu Theoretical High School and the István Zajzoni Rab Theoretical High School.

==Sport==
The local football team is FC Precizia Săcele, currently playing in Liga IV. Its home ground is Stadionul Electro-Precizia.

==Population==
According to the 2021 census, Săcele has a population of 30,920. At the 2011 census, the city had a population of 30,798 of which 75.1% were Romanians, 23% Hungarians, 1.2% Roma, and 0.2% Germans. At the 2002 census, 69% were Romanian Orthodox, 15.2% Evangelical Lutheran, 4.9% Roman Catholic, 3.4% each Reformed, and Pentecostal, 1.1% belong to &quot;another religion&quot; and 0.5% Unitarian.

<text>.ge is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Georgia. 

== Registration ==
.ge top-level domain names are available for direct registration for individuals and companies worldwide, without any restriction on citizenship or residence. 

Second-level domain names are also available for registration for several specific types of registrants:
==History==
.ge was delegated to Georgian ISP SaNet in 1992. In 2006 Caucasus Online has been formed after merger of 3 companies (including SaNet) and became sponsor of . 

Registration service was initially provided by non-profit organization Internet Development Group - Georgia, but after introduction of Caucasus Online it exclusively consolidated both administrative and registrar roles. .gov.ge was delegated to LEPL Smart Logic in 2014.

=== Registrar Companies ===
Since 16 April 2018, according to renewed regulations of Registration and administration of .GE domain, Caucasus Online administrates only the .GE country code top-level domain. 

The registrar&#x27;s functions and duties are exercised by registrars, accredited by Caucasus Online, who will register and manage .GE domain names; the .GE country code top level domain is registered by accredited companies.

==.გე==
In 2011, a new top-level domain name was registered for Georgia, intended for domain names in the local language. 

The top-level domain is .გე (.xn--node), which are the Georgian letters &quot;gani&quot; and &quot;eni&quot;, representing G and E rather than an abbreviation of the nation&#x27;s native name, &quot;Sakartvelo&quot;. It became active with active web sites in 2016.

Starting 20 January 2016, Georgia registered .გე top-level domains using Georgian &quot;Mkhedruli&quot; script. 

At first, the process started for reservation of governmental and commercial TLDs but after 6 months from start date, registration of IDN ccTLDs became available to the general public.

<doc id="1230857" wikidata="Q5096743" url="?curid=1230857" title="Chief Financial Officers Act">
<text>The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–576) signed into law by President George H. W. Bush on November 15, 1990, is a United States federal law intended to improve the government&#x27;s financial management, outlining standards of financial performance and disclosure. Among other measures, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was given greater authority over federal financial management. For each of 24 federal departments and agencies, the position of chief financial officer was created. In accordance with the CFO Act, each agency or department vests its financial management functions in its chief financial officer. The following is a list of the 24 affected agencies, which includes all 15 federal executive departments whose heads are included in the Cabinet of the United States, as well as other large agencies:

*Department of Agriculture
*Department of Commerce
*Department of Defense
*Department of Education
*Department of Energy
*Department of Health and Human Services
*Department of Homeland Security
*Department of Housing and Urban Development
*Department of the Interior
*Department of Justice
*Department of Labor
*Department of State
*Department of Transportation
*Department of Treasury
*Department of Veterans Affairs
*Environmental Protection Agency
*National Aeronautics and Space Administration
*Agency for International Development
*Social Security Administration
*General Services Administration
*National Science Foundation
*Nuclear Regulatory Commission
*Office of Personnel Management
*Small Business Administration

The Act created a new position in the OMB, the Deputy Director for Management, who is the government&#x27;s chief financial management official. It also created a new sub-division of the OMB, the Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM), to carry out government-wide financial management responsibilities. The OFFM&#x27;s chief officer was designated as the newly created Controller position. Both the Deputy Director for Management and the Controller are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.

The Committee on Government Reform oversees the management and infrastructure of the federal agencies, including those covered by the CFO Act.

The CFO Act also established the CFO Council, consisting of the CFOs and Deputy CFOs of the largest federal agencies and senior officials of OMB and Treasury.

For a discussion of the history and motivation underlying the CFO Act - with particular emphasis on the difficulties the U.S. Department of Defense has experienced attempting to comply with the financial-statement reporting requirements of the Act - see &quot;Financial Accountability at the DOD: Reviewing the Bidding,&quot; published in the July 2009 issue of the Defense Acquisition Review Journal, pgs. 181–196.

The CFO Act was authored by staff of the House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations, now the Committee of Government Oversight and Reform, under the leadership of Committee Chairman John Conyers (D-MI) and Ranking Minority Member Frank Horton (R-NY). The CFO Act passed the House of Representatives by Unanimous Consent.

Federal agencies not listed above, including at least 75 small or &quot;micro&quot; agencies, are not subject to the CFO Act. These agencies may be subject to other financial reporting standards under provisions such as the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002.

<doc id="1230858" wikidata="Q279159" url="?curid=1230858" title="Archer Heights, Chicago">
<text>Archer Heights is a community area in Chicago, Illinois, one of the 77 official community areas of Chicago.

Archer Avenue runs from south of Chicago&#x27;s downtown area, through the southwest side of Chicago and beyond into the southwest suburbs, along what was once a Native American trail. The neighborhood is bounded by the Stevenson Expressway to the north, the CTA Orange Line to the south, the Corwith railyard to the east, and the railroad tracks/Knox Avenue to the west.

== History ==
Archer Heights was originally inhabited by Native American tribes. Starting in the nineteenth-century, land speculators and farmers sparked interest in the swampy lands. The land became a primary focus for real-estate developers and manufacturers. It gained exceptional interest from William B. Archer, an Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal commissioner and land speculator from whom Archer Heights gained its name.

After speculators came in in 1900 and developed the southern sections of Archer Heights for residential use, railroads sustained control of the north side real estate. Due to horse cars in the late 1890s, and electric streetcars gaining popularity in the early 1900s, immigrant laborers started to pour into Archer Heights. Starting in the 1920s and 1930s, Archer Heights had its largest population growth coming from the Polish, Italian, Czech, and Russian Jewish communities. During this time modern urban groundwork and two Catholic parishes, St. Bruno&#x27;s (1925) and St. Richard&#x27;s (1938), helped stimulate population growth.

After World War II population began to make a comeback; between 1930 and 1950, the Archer Heights community grew from 8,120 to 8,675. In the following years the population sprouted to 10,584, peaking by 1970 at 11,143. However, by 1980, the population fell off to 9,708, and continued to do so in 1990 falling to 9,227.

For over 90 years, the Archer Heights community has been predominantly white (96 percent in 1990), with a large contingent of foreign-born residents (27 percent in 1990), and a strong Polish cohort. In the 1990s, Hispanics, and primarily Mexicans, rose to 8 percent of the population. &quot;While Archer Heights continues to be home to a large Polish community, since 2000 it became the latest swath of the Southwest Side bungalow belt where Hispanics have become the majority.&quot;

At the end of the twentieth century, approximately 60 percent of the area was dedicated to manufacturing and bulk transportation facilities, 30 percent to residences, and 10 percent to commerce.

It has been used for some official domains for the Spanish city of Girona due to its coincidence in abbreviation. 

This limited use began prior to the creation of the .cat TLD because of Catalan reluctance to use domains under the Spanish country code TLD .es. 

Subsequent rules changes prevent new 2nd level registrations directly under .gi for entities not connected with Gibraltar.

<doc id="1230883" wikidata="Q248959" url="?curid=1230883" title="Zărnești">
<text>Zărnești (; ; ) is a town in Brașov County, Transylvania, Romania, with a population of 21,624 as of 2021. It administers one village, Tohanu Nou (&quot;Neu-Tohan&quot;; &quot;Újtohán&quot;).

The town is located near the Piatra Craiului Mountains, which are part of the Southern Carpathians mountain range. Its close proximity to these mountains make it a common start point for tourists and hikers wishing to explore the Piatra Craiului National Park.

==History==
During the Roman period, soldiers of the Legio XIII Gemina were buried in the territory that is modern day Zărnești. It is first mentioned in the year 1373 under the name Zârna and also referred to as &quot;possessio regalis Zerne&quot; in 1395. Other names that appeared after 1437 are Zerna, Villa Czerne, and Zernyest.

Modern day Zărnești developed in the same location as the historic one. The commune of Tohan, which is now part of the town, was first mentioned in the year 1294, and remains among the oldest settlements in Romanian which have kept their name and location unchanged.

In the 1690 Battle of Zernest, Ottoman ally Imre Thököly (in cooperation with Wallachian Voivode Constantin Brâncoveanu) defeated Habsburg forces, which enabled him to become Prince of Transylvania for a short time.

Due to the topographical diversity of Zărnești and surrounding area, agriculture became the primary occupation for its residents until not too long ago. Industrialization began sometime in the 1800s, with the construction of the paper manufacturing plant in 1852, then called Celuloza, now called Celohart – EcoPaper&quot;), and the weapons plant &quot;6 Martie&quot; in 1936. These projects turned Zărnești from a predominantly rural to an urban town.

In December 1939, disaster hit the town as 24 tons of chlorine gas were spilled, killing 60 people, even at considerable distance from the plant where a storage vessel failed.

The town of Zărnești developed largely in the communist era, bringing its population to 25,000 people, which contributed to the addition of a few neighborhoods of communist era blocs. In 1951, Zărnești was declared a town, of which Tohanul Vechi (Old Tohan) became a part of. In 1968, the commune of Tohanul Nou (New Tohan) was included in Zărnești proper. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the industrial plants closed, only to be sold piece by piece to private buyers.

Currently, Zărnești enjoys a spike in tourism, relieving some of the pressure of unemployment which followed the revolution.

==Name==
The Romanian name &quot;Zărnești&quot; is a derivation from &quot;&quot; (Black Nightshade), a word of Slavic origin (from Old Church Slavonic &quot;&quot;, grain) and suffix -ești.

==Climate==
Zărnești has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).

==Notable people==
* Ioan Bran de Lemény, lawyer, revolutionary, and Transylvania&#x27;s first Romanian civil servant
* Gheorghe Crăciun, writer and translator
* Eduard-Michael Grosu, professional racing cyclist, born in Zărnești
* Alexandru Ilie, professional footballer

<text>The Gants was an American garage rock band that formed in 1964 in Greenwood, Mississippi, in the cultural and geographic Deep South.

== History ==
The Kingsmen – a different band from the Kingsmen that had a major hit with &quot;Louie Louie&quot; in the same time period – began with Sid Herring &amp; Johnny Freeman in 1963 playing R&amp;B covers and the type of instrumentals popularized by The Ventures. The Gants were formed shortly after by Sid Herring (lead vocals and guitar), Johnny Sanders (October 8, 1945 – September 29, 2012; guitar), Vince Montgomery (bass guitar), and Don Wood (December 19, 1949 – May 14, 2011; drums).

Several events combined to push the band from the obscurity of playing other artists&#x27; songs at Greenwood, Mississippi dances and into the popular genres of 1960s garage-rock. Freeman dropped out of the Kingsmen because of conflicts with his parents over touring out-of-town. After discussions with Vince Montgomery and Don Wood, Sid Herring replaced Freeman with Johnny Sanders. The band name was changed to The Gants, after a popular brand of shirt with a button-down collar, which is also the French word for &quot;glove&quot;. In 1965, The Gants released their first single and album, Road Runner. At the same time, Herring, who resembled Peter Noone of Herman&#x27;s Hermits, began writing some original songs. In early 1965, The Gants were overheard by a U.S. tour manager and coordinator for The Animals, York Noble, while playing in the Holiday Inn ballroom in Laurel, Mississippi and were chosen to open for that band&#x27;s Florida tour. This turned out to be a typical development for The Gants — playing the first set for more famous groups — but opportunities were limited with half the band still in high school and the other half in college.

At this point, The Gants had a professional sound and a repertoire of original material and an even larger repertoire of covers, which were reflected in the choice of sides for their first single: (Bo Diddley&#x27;s) &quot;Road Runner&quot; backed with (Herring&#x27;s own) &quot;My Baby Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, released on the Statue label in mid-1965. The record showed enough potential for re-release on a major label, Liberty Records, in September, and it gained some modest chart success, reaching #46 in the US and #28 in Australia. Later that year, Liberty released The Gants&#x27; first album, &quot;Roadrunner&quot;. In January 1966 a new single was released, &quot;Little Boy Sad&quot;, which included an early use of the talk box later made famous by Joe Walsh and Peter Frampton. The band tried to get Liberty to release their recording of Them&#x27;s &quot;Gloria&quot; but the label declined. The song later became a hit for The Shadows of Knight.

A definite pattern had been established: The Gants were able to record and make brief tours during vacations, but that was never enough. Radio stations gave up on their records when the band could not get away from their responsibilities at home for promotional appearances. In 1966 and early 1967, several singles and two more albums were released, &quot;Gants Galore&quot; and &quot;Gants Again&quot;. None of these releases had significant chart impact. During this period Johnny Sanders had quit and was replaced by Johnny Freeman, for a couple of gigs and a trip to California, which proved fruitless. Then Freeman was replaced again after they returned from California in the summer of 1967, and three of the Gants headed back to Greenwood, leaving Herring in Los Angeles with a job as a staff songwriter for Liberty Records.

Despite their lack of hits, The Gants maintained a minor cult aura within the garage rock ethos and were not entirely forgotten. One of their songs, Herring&#x27;s &quot;I Wonder&quot; was included on the 1980 compilation album, &quot;Pebbles, Volume 8&quot;. In 2000, Sundazed Music released &quot;Roadrunner! The Best of The Gants&quot;, with liner notes by Mike Stax; their single &quot;Little Boy Sad&quot; was included on Oxford American magazine&#x27;s &quot;Southern Sampler&quot; music CD.

In 2005, The Gants were performing together again: Sid Herring, Don Wood, Johnny Sanders, (Johnny Freeman rhythm guitar rejoined the band in 2001) with bassist Ed Foresman replacing Vince Montgomery, who died of natural causes in January 2001 at his home in Clarksdale, Mississippi, at age 54.

Don Wood died in his home in Greenwood, Mississippi on May 14, 2011, at age 61.

Johnny Sanders died at home on September 29, 2012, from Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease, at age 66. He was an MD, and founded Sanders Clinic for Women in Tupelo, MS.

<doc id="1230891" wikidata="Q7370485" url="?curid=1230891" title="Rothko case">
<text>The Rothko case was the protracted legal dispute between Kate Rothko, the daughter of the painter Mark Rothko; the painter&#x27;s estate executors; and the directors of his gallery, Marlborough Fine Art. The revelations in the case of greed, abuses of power and conspiracy by financial interests in the art world were described by the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court of New York state, as &quot;manifestly wrongful and indeed shocking&quot;, serving as a cautionary tale for both artists and their gallerists.

==Summary==
The entire Rothko matter involved few litigants, but many counsel, some of them with lengthy professional services over a period from 1971 to 1979. Proceedings included removal of the estate&#x27;s original executors, setting aside the contracts those executors made with the Marlborough gallery, eliminating the rights of the gallery with respect to its inter vivos contracts with the artist, restoring hundreds of paintings to the artist&#x27;s estate, removal proceedings to compensate the estate for paintings not returnable to it to the extent of millions of dollars, election proceedings litigating the rights of election by the children against an excessive charitable distribution, contents proceedings construing Mark Rothko&#x27;s will as to the meaning of the &quot;contents&quot; of the family residence willed to his widow and to her estate and later by the widow&#x27;s will to Rothko&#x27;s children, and valuation proceedings for valuing the art, assessed costs, fees, and taxes.

==Details==
On September 16, 1968, Rothko executed a two-page will, drafted by and its execution supervised by his friend Bernard Reis, an unlicensed law-school graduate and Certified Public Accountant, leaving all of his residual estate to the non-profit Rothko Foundation which Rothko organized shortly before his death.

Five months later on February 21, 1969, Rothko entered into an agreement with Marlborough A.G., a Liechtenstein corporation with international galleries, which provided in part that he agreed &quot;not to sell any works of art for a period of eight years, except to Marlborough A.G. if a supplementary contract is made.&quot;

One year later Rothko died by suicide on February 25, 1970, leaving an estate consisting primarily but not entirely of 798 of his paintings. Rothko&#x27;s wife Mary Alice died of a stroke six months after her husband&#x27;s demise. Rothko&#x27;s will was admitted to probate the month following his death, naming his estate executors: Bernard Reis, who had drafted Rothko&#x27;s will and who became a Marlborough Gallery New York director the month before Rothko died; Theodoros Stamos, a friend and fellow artist represented by Marlborough New York starting in 1971; and Morton Levine, an anthropology professor, unconnected with Marlborough but who had been Rothko&#x27;s son Christopher&#x27;s guardian for a short time.

Shortly before his death in 1970, Rothko made gifts to his children of certain key paintings in his possession in an effort to provide his children with financial security, since he believed that key patrons would pay higher prices for the works following his death. However, after Rothko died, his children were notified by the Marlborough&#x27;s founder, Francis Kenneth Lloyd, that under the terms of the agreement made with the gallery in 1966 and renewed in 1969, the gallery owned all of Rothko&#x27;s paintings.

Following Rothko&#x27;s death the three executors for the estate agreed to sell 100 works to Marlborough for a total of $1,800,000 while a further 698 works were consigned to the gallery for sale at a fixed commission of 50%, however, the executors paid only $200,000 upfront to the estate. In the year after Rothko&#x27;s death, the value of his work more than doubled while early works were selling at auction for over $80,000.

In 1971 Kate Rothko sued to release the estate from the sale agreement and have the paintings returned to the family. The legal proceedings revealed that when still a struggling artist with a young family, Rothko agreed to a deal with the gallery in which all of his paintings would be sold through the gallery in exchange for a set monthly fee. Such terms were not unheard of, as Pablo Picasso had had a similar deal with his gallery in the 1920s.

It emerged from the proceedings that the estate executors and the gallery defrauded Rothko and his estate through various methods of self-dealing. Among other wrongful acts, the gallery had been filtering payments for Rothko&#x27;s works through accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein as part of an effort to ensure the paintings were undervalued during Rothko&#x27;s lifetime — in the 1960s this led the artist to vastly underestimate the value of his works, directly resulting in his agreement to consignments of dozens of paintings to the gallery and collectors without appreciating his works&#x27; full value.

The trial record revealed that the gallery had been stockpiling the undervalued works instead of selling them in order to ensure both a low market saturation and a high Marlborough inventory, anticipating a heightened value in the market after Rothko&#x27;s death. Further, the 100 paintings &#x27;sold&#x27; after Rothko&#x27;s death by the estate executors through Marlborough were not sold to bona fide purchasers, but were instead retained by the gallery which shuffled the sale monies through its accounts in Europe, and which then quickly &#x27;re-sold&#x27; the works to actual purchasers for 5 to 6 times the value declared by the estate. Many works were sold this way by the Marlborough with the complicity of the executors despite the court&#x27;s injunction against selling any works while the case was unresolved and still before the courts.

Ultimately, certain directors at Marlborough were convicted of defrauding the Rothko family, and in 1975, the court ordered the gallery to pay over $9 million in damages and costs, and also ordered the gallery to return 658 Rothko paintings it still held. Marlborough disputed the return of the paintings and was able to prevail as to those works it had sold during the proceedings in defiance of the court&#x27;s orders to the contrary. Those works remained in the hands of collectors, including Rothko&#x27;s 1953 oil on canvas painting, &quot;Homage to Matisse&quot;, which later sold at public auction for US $22.4 million.

==Valuation issues==
The courts involved in litigating the Rothko matter were faced with many complex issues as part of and beyond the wrongdoing of the Marlborough group as estate executors. In particular, the valuation of services rendered by counsel were litigated at length; and the valuation of the paintings posed complex questions as their valuation affected nearly every other matter facing the court. In 1979 after much of the matter&#x27;s litigation had already taken place, the court said:... [T]he bulk of the estate was and is in the form of hundreds of paintings rather than cash ... and ... [the] Internal Revenue Service may not at an early time complete its final determination with respect to date-of-death estate taxes. The estate is presently resisting a deficiency assessment of large proportions. In litigating that issue there is not only a difference of opinion with respect to the value of the hundreds of paintings in this estate but also whether a blockage discount should be given to the estate and whether a further discount should be available due to the inter vivos contract for an exclusive agency in favor of Marlborough Galleries for seven years after death, and finally whether a discount should be enjoyed by the estate for commissions which must be paid for selling many of the paintings by agents of the estate.
[P]revailing counsel have participated in approximately 20,000 pages of transcript of pretrial and trial testimony; thousands of exhibits have been introduced and considered; thousands of pages of briefs have been submitted to this court and to the appellate courts; many decisions were made in this court, pretrial as well as the ultimate disposition; the Appellate Division has ruled on these matters several times; and the Court of Appeals has finally unanimously affirmed the major disposition made in this court, (43 N.Y.2d 305, 401 N.Y.S.2d 449, 372 N.E.2d 291).

==Former estate executors==
The Internal Revenue Service audited the Rothko Foundation and determined that Mark Rothko&#x27;s former friend and ex-estate executor Bernard Reis was liable for various self-dealing excise taxes under section 4941 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRS code) for the years 1970 through 1974 in the total amount of $18,582,500, and additions to tax under sections 6651 and 6684 for the same years in the respective total amounts of $518,125 and $2,112,500. Reis&#x27; estate (he was dead by that time) lost its summary judgment motion to make the ruling go away.

Despite Theodoros Stamos&#x27; protestations that he had done nothing wrong, the Tax Court also ruled against him for liability for various self-dealing excise taxes under IRS code section 4941 for the years 1970 through 1976 in the total amount of $19,407,500, and additions to tax under sections 6651(a)(1) and 6684 for the same years in the respective total amounts of $724,375 and $2,957,500. Stamos also lost his appeal.

Marlborough A.G.&#x27;s founder Frank Lloyd paid a third of the $9.2 million award to the Rothko children as a fine against Marlborough for violating the court&#x27;s injunction against the sale of any further paintings before a final ruling or settlement. The disgraced Lloyd is not mentioned as active after 1972 on the gallery history page on Marlborough&#x27;s website. Lloyd died in 1998 at age 86.

==In film==
Thirteen years after his death, Mark Rothko&#x27;s tale aired as a television movie: &quot;The Rothko Conspiracy,&quot; a co-production of the BBC and Lionheart Television. The filmmakers based their work on the 1978 book, &quot;The Legacy of Mark Rothko&quot;, on interviews and the trial transcripts. In 2021, &quot;Rothko&quot;, a film adaptation of Seldes&#x27; book, was announced, with Sam Taylor-Johnson directing.

<text>The Winter Park Company was incorporated by Florida state law chapter 3669, approved February 6, 1885. It was owned by Loring A. Chase, Olive E. Chapman and J. F. Welborne of Winter Park, Florida, and Orrison S. Marden and Frank G. Webster of Boston, Massachusetts. Among its powers were laying out roads on its property, buying and building hotels, and &quot;the sole and exclusive right to build, equip, maintain and operate a street railway or railways in Winter Park, Orange county, Florida, and for such purpose to use any and all the streets, roads and ways now or in the future there laid out, and it may at any time sell and dispose of such railway or railways, and the equipment thereto belonging, as well as the privilege of operating the same.&quot;

The company built a mule-drawn streetcar line, known as the Seminole Hotel Horse Car, along New England Avenue from the Seminole Hotel at the east end of New England Avenue, west to the South Florida Railroad (later Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) station. The tracks were later extended south on Ollie Avenue to the Orlando and Winter Park Railway (later Seaboard Air Line Railroad) station. Tracks were removed in 1903.

<text>EG&amp;G, formally known as Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier, Inc., was a United States national defense contractor and provider of management and technical services. The company was involved in contracting services to the United States government during World War II and conducted weapons research and development during the Cold war era (from 1948 and onward). It had close involvement with some of the government&#x27;s most sensitive technologies.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
In 1931, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor Harold Edgerton, a pioneer of high-speed photography, partnered with his graduate student Kenneth Germeshausen to found a small technical consulting firm. The two were joined by fellow MIT graduate student Herbert E. Grier in 1934. Bernard &quot;Barney&quot; O&#x27;Keefe became the fourth member of their fledgling technology group.

The group&#x27;s high-speed photography was used to image implosion tests during the Manhattan Project. The same skills in precisely timed high-power electrical pulses also formed a key enabling technology for nuclear weapon triggers. After the war, the group continued their association with the burgeoning military nuclear effort and formally incorporated Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier, Inc. in 1947.

=== 1950s and 1960s ===
During the 1950s and 1960s, EG&amp;G was involved in nuclear tests as a major contractor for the Atomic Energy Commission. EG&amp;G made extensive use of the Nevada Test Site (NTS) for weapons development and high-technology military testing at Nellis AFB. EG&amp;G has shared operations responsibility for the NTS with Livermore Labs, Raytheon Services Nevada, Reynolds Electrical and Engineering (REECO) and others. Subsequently, EG&amp;G expanded its range of services, providing facilities management, technical services, security, and pilot training for the U.S. military and other government departments. EG&amp;G builds a variety of sensing, detection and imaging products including night vision equipment, sensors for detection of nuclear material and chemical and biological weapons agents, and a variety of acoustic sensors. The company also supplies microwave and electronic components to the government, security systems, and systems for electronic warfare and mine countermeasures.

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
During the 1970s and 1980s, the company, then led by O&#x27;Keefe, diversified by acquisition into the fields of paper making, instrumentation for scientific, marine, environmental and geophysical users, automotive testing, fans and blowers, frequency control devices and other components including BBD and CCD technology via their Reticon division. In the late 1980s and early 1990s most of these divisions were sold, and on 28 May 1999, the non-government side of EG&amp;G Inc.; formerly ; purchased the Analytical Instruments Division of PerkinElmer for million (equivalent to $million in ), also assuming the PerkinElmer name (). At the time EG&amp;G was based in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and made products for diverse industries including automotive, medical, aerospace and photography. At least in 1988, there was either a subsidiary or internal department of EG&amp;G dubbed EG &amp; G Biomolecular that produced the Acugen 402 DNA sequencer, the first (and perhaps only) commercially available automated DNA sequencer that used slab gel electrophoresis and radioactive Sanger sequencing.

=== 1999–present ===
From 1999 until 2001, EG&amp;G was wholly owned by The Carlyle Group.

In August 2002, the defense-and-services sector of the company was acquired by defense technical-services giant URS Corporation. URS&#x27; EG&amp;G division is headquartered in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and employs over 11,000 people. During its heyday in the 1980s, EG&amp;G had about 35,000 employees.

In December 2009, URS announced its decision to discontinue the use of &quot;EG&amp;G&quot; as a division name. The headquarters issued a press release stating that by January 1, 2010 it would discontinue using secondary corporate brands, including the EG&amp;G name and logo. In the same press release, URS stated that it would also retire two other acquired brands, Washington Group and Lear Siegler. URS Chief Executive Officer Martin Koffel explained the change in an e-mail transmitted to employees: &quot;In today&#x27;s marketplace, it is essential we present a consistent, unified brand to our customers and achieve the competitive advantages enjoyed by our peers in the industry. ... This change will allow us to present a single brand that is easily understood by our clients&quot;. Koffel indicated that the move to a single corporate brand would affect neither the internal organization nor the existing reporting structure. However, EG&amp;G Division would become URS Federal Services.

In 2014, URS was acquired by AECOM. In January 2020, AECOM sold its Management Services division, which provides services and support to governmental clients, to the private equity firm American Securities and Lindsay Goldberg for billion (equivalent to $billion in ); the new firm was named Amentum.

== Janet Airlines ==
EG&amp;G&#x27;s &quot;Special Projects&quot; division was the notable operator of the Janet Terminal at McCarran International Airport [Now Harry Reid] Las Vegas, Nevada, a service used to transport employees to remote government locations in Nevada and California. EG&amp;G also had a joint venture with Raytheon Technical Services, creating JT3 LLC in 2000, which operates the Joint Range Technical Services contract.

== Lear Siegler Services, Inc. ==
EG&amp;G Technical Services, Inc. and Lear Siegler Services, Inc. consolidated, becoming one of the nation&#x27;s leading U.S. federal government contractors providing operations and maintenance, systems engineering and technical assistance, and program management, primarily to the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The companies are separate legal entities, but share a common management. In December 2009, URS announced its decision to discontinue the Lear Siegler name for this division.

<text>The Gruta Rei do Mato (MG-3653) is a cave located at the edge of the BR-040 highway, close to the off ramp to the city of Sete Lagoas, in Minas Gerais, Brazil. From Sete Lagoas the cave can easily be reached by bus, taxi or car. Sete Lagoas is from Belo Horizonte, the capital of the state.

==Name==
Gruta Rei do Mato means &quot;Cave of the Forest King&quot; in Portuguese. The name divides into &quot;Gruta&quot; (cave) and &quot;Rei do Mato&quot; (Forest King). According to several local sources, the &quot;Rei do Mato&quot; was a fugitive in either the Gruta Rei do Mato or another cave in the vicinity. According to the authors of &quot;Dona Brasil&quot;, he lived in a hut near the grotto.

==Geology==
The limestone area north of Belo Horizonte is called the Sete Lagoas Formation, in which the Lagoa Santa Karst developed. The area around Sete Lagoas has many cave systems, of which the Gruta Rei do Mato is the most widely known. The cave has four large chambers with numerous stalactites, stalagmites and rimstone dams. In the &quot;Rarities Hall&quot; are nearly identical parallel columns, formed by the calcium carbonate crystals of calcite. These columns are more than high and in diameter.

In the nearby Parque da Cascata is a collapsed karst crater which can be recognised by some stalactites that are oriented horizontally as a result of the collapse. In a small cave next to the Gruta Rei do Mato, 4,000 to 6,000 year old cave paintings were discovered, as well as skeletal remains of the &quot;Xenorhinotherium bahiense&quot;, an extinct Pleistocene mammal. A replica of this animal can be found in the cave.

<text>Richard Avedis Hagopian (born April 3, 1937) is an Armenian-American oud player and a traditional Armenian musician. Hagopian achieved popularity in the 1960s and 70s as a member of the Kef Time Band, performing &quot;kef&quot; music, a dance-oriented style of Armenian folk music popular with diaspora communities.

==Early life==

Hagopian was born in Fowler, California to Armenian parents. He has been a musician since childhood, learning to play the violin and clarinet at nine years old. He started playing the oud at age of 11. At first he was self-taught, and then by invitation he studied Eastern (Ottoman Classical) music theory and oud under the Armenian kanun player Kanuni Garbis Bakirgian. Hagopian also took lessons by correspondence from legendary blind Armenian oudist Udi Hrant Kenkulian of Istanbul, who in 1969 gave him the title of &quot;Udi&quot; (oud master), being one of the few to receive this title.

==Career==

Hagopian was a founding member of the Kef Time Band, which was formed in 1963 and gained fame in the next few decades. According to the liner notes of the 1968 LP &quot;Kef Time Las Vegas&quot;, the Kef Time Band was formed originally as the band for a Las Vegas show called the &quot;Cleopatra Revue&quot;, which ran at the Flamingo Hotel from 1963–1968. During this time the leader of the &quot;Cleopatra Revue&quot; band, Armenian-American &quot;dumbeg&quot; player Buddy Sarkissian, met Hagopian and immediately hired him after hearing him play the oud and sing. This was the beginning of the Kef Time Band&#x27;s career; they would go on to become the most famous band playing the &quot;kef&quot; style of dance music popular among the Armenian-American community.

Hagopian has performed throughout the United States and taught a master class at the Manhattan School of Music, as well as teaching as artist-in-residence at California State University. For over 30 years, Hagopian has played annually at &quot;Kef Time&quot; events at dance gatherings (&quot;kefs&quot;) in Cape Cod, Hartford, and Detroit. He is a recipient of a 1989 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government&#x27;s highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.

His son is the violinist Harold Hagopian, also a music producer who runs the independent traditional music label Traditional Crossroads.

<text>Eddie Jones (December 10, 1926 – February 7, 1959), known as Guitar Slim, was an American guitarist in the 1940s and 1950s, best known for the million-selling song &quot;The Things That I Used to Do&quot;, for Specialty Records. It is listed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. Slim had a major impact on rock and roll and experimented with distorted tones on the electric guitar a full decade before Jimi Hendrix.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Jones was born in Greenwood, Mississippi. His mother died when he was five, and he was raised by his grandmother. In his teen years, he worked in cotton fields and spent his free time at juke joints, where he started sitting in as a singer or dancer; he was good enough as a dancer that he was nicknamed &quot;Limber Leg&quot;.

===Recording career===
After returning from military service during World War II, he started playing in clubs around New Orleans, Louisiana. Bandleader Willie D. Warren introduced him to the guitar. He was particularly influenced by T-Bone Walker and Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown. About 1950 he adopted the stage name Guitar Slim and became known for his wild stage act. He wore bright-colored suits and dyed his hair to match them. He had an assistant who followed him around the audience with up to 350 feet of cord between his guitar and his amplifier, and occasionally rode on his assistant&#x27;s shoulders or even took his guitar outside the club, bringing traffic to a stop. His sound was just as unusual—he played his guitar with distortion more than a decade before rock guitarists did, and his gospel-influenced vocals were easily identifiable.
He got together with Muddy Waters in Los Angeles, California, for some lively playing.

===Recordings===
His first recording session was in 1951. He had a minor rhythm and blues hit in 1952 with &quot;Feelin&#x27; Sad&quot;, which Ray Charles covered. His biggest success was &quot;The Things That I Used to Do&quot; (1954), produced by the young Ray Charles and released by Art Rupe&#x27;s Specialty Records. The song spent weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and sold over a million copies, soon becoming a blues standard. It also contributed to the development of soul music. He recorded for several labels, including Imperial, Bullet, Specialty, and Atco.

===Death and legacy===
Jones died of pneumonia in New York City, at the age of 32. He is buried in a small cemetery in Thibodaux, Louisiana, where his manager, Hosea Hill, resided.

Buddy Guy, Albert Collins and Frank Zappa were influenced by Guitar Slim. Other musicians have used the nickname Guitar Slim. The North Carolina blues guitarist James Stephens had several releases under this billing. One of Jones&#x27;s sons bills himself as Guitar Slim Jr. around the New Orleans circuit. His repertoire includes many of his father&#x27;s songs.

<text>New York, New York is a 1977 American romantic musical film directed by Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch and Mardik Martin, based on a story by Rauch. John Kander and Fred Ebb wrote several songs for the film, including &quot;New York, New York&quot; which became a global phenomenon. A tribute to Scorsese&#x27;s home town of New York City, the film stars Liza Minnelli and Robert De Niro as a pair of musicians and lovers.

==Plot==
On V-J Day in 1945, a massive celebration in a New York City nightclub is underway, music provided by the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra. While there, selfish and smooth-talking saxophone player Jimmy Doyle (De Niro) meets small-time USO singer Francine Evans (Minnelli), who, although lonely, still wants nothing to do with Jimmy, who keeps pestering her for her phone number.

The next morning, they end up sharing a cab, and, against her will, Francine accompanies Jimmy to an audition. There he gets into an argument with the club owner. Francine, to get the audition back on track, begins to sing the old standard, &quot;You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me&quot;; Jimmy joins in on his sax. The club owner is impressed and, to Francine&#x27;s astonishment, they are both offered a job — as a traveling boy-girl act. From that moment on, Jimmy and Francine&#x27;s relationship deepens into a mix of obsession and love. But there are problems — mainly, Jimmy&#x27;s tendency to fight with his co-workers, overly dramatic behavior, and his increasingly violent arguments with Francine, who becomes pregnant with his child. An especially bad shouting match between them results in Francine going into labor. Jimmy rushes her to the hospital, where she delivers a baby boy. But Jimmy is not ready to be a father, or a good husband, and he abandons his wife, declining even to see his newborn son as he leaves the hospital.

Several years later, in a recording studio, Francine records &quot;But the World Goes Round,&quot; a powerful anthem which makes the charts and turns her into a popular entertainment figure. In the years that follow, Jimmy and Francine both find success in the music industry; he becomes a renowned jazz musician and club owner, while she becomes a successful singer and film actress.

Jimmy records a song of his on his saxophone which tops the jazz charts, and Francine cements her stardom after singing that same song, &quot;New York, New York,&quot; for which she has provided the lyrics. Her performance, received by a wildly appreciative audience, takes place in the same nightclub where, years earlier, she and Jimmy had met. After the show, Jimmy telephones his ex-wife, suggesting they get together for dinner. Francine is tempted, heads toward the stage door exit, but at the last moment changes her mind. Jimmy, waiting on the sidewalk, realizes he has been stood up and heads off down the street, accompanied by the song he has written — the &quot;Theme from &quot;New York, New York&quot;.

==Production==
Irwin Winkler&#x27;s purchase of the screenplay for &quot;New York, New York&quot; caught Martin Scorsese&#x27;s attention before he began filming &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. Winkler and Robert Chartoff had agreed to a four-year contract with United Artists where they would release a minimum of 12 films, and &quot;New York, New York&quot; was the first film produced under the deal. They announced Scorsese as the director in April 1975 with a budget of $3.5 million. Lynn Stalmaster was the casting director. Filming began on June 14, 1976.

Scorsese wanted to marry the movie musical of his parents&#x27; generation with a documentary style. He hoped the juxtaposition would emphasize the continuity between human relationships through history. The actors would improvise on the script in front of the massive, unrealistic sets that fit the musical style. Having just won the Palme d&#x27;Or, he arrogantly felt he could improve the script during filming, but his excesses led to mistakes like the opening V-J Day sequence being an hour long. The initial cut of the film was four and a half hours.

Scorsese&#x27;s cocaine addiction made matters worse, and according to Peter Biskind, the director was also taking lithium to control his anger. Scorsese lamented, &quot;I was just too drugged out to resolve the structure&quot;. He even cut press interviews short one day because he explained he had run out of cocaine. He concluded, &quot;it&#x27;s a miracle that the film makes any kind of sense.&quot;

The director had an affair with Liza Minnelli during filming, and his second wife Julia Cameron was often on set trying to catch them. The improvisation of dialogue was an additional strain on Minnelli who was not used to method acting. The stress is sometimes visible in her scenes with De Niro. Before their relationship ended, Scorsese directed Minnelli in &quot;The Act&quot;, a Kander &amp; Ebb musical that some saw as a spin-off of the film.

Robert De Niro studied the saxophone with Georgie Auld, a veteran of swing giants Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman&#x27;s bands. Auld also played bandleader Frankie Hart in the film. De Niro was so demanding of Auld&#x27;s time that the musician felt like a &quot;slave&quot;, and his wife worried the actor would be joining them in bed with the instrument. Auld recorded the saxophone parts in the film, and De Niro mimed to them on set. Auld stood off-camera and would make a slashing motion if De Niro made a fingering or breathing mistake.

The film cost $9 million, which was $2 million over the original budget and was a much larger amount than the budgets for Scorsese&#x27;s previous films. George Lucas predicted that the gross would improve by $10 million if Scorsese would change the ending to a happy one.

Scorsese considered having a cameo appearance in the film, but declined as he would have needed to shave his beard.

==Releases==
The film was released on June 21, 1977 with a running time of 155 minutes. The box-office failure of the film prompted United Artists to cut the film down to 136 minutes for Europe.

In 1981, the film was re-released with a runtime of 163 minutes. Scorsese had spent $350,000 of the budget on filming a musical-within-a-musical called &quot;Happy Endings&quot; which depicts Francine Evans as a movie star. The twelve-minute sequence was choreographed by Ron Field. The scene was restored in the 1981 version, and the expanded film earned praise for its ironic look at Hollywood musicals. It is a re-released hit.

==Music==
===Theme Song===
Fred Ebb and John Kander&#x27;s initial submission for the theme song was so bad that Robert De Niro rejected it outright. The lyrics began, &quot;They always say it&#x27;s a nice place to visit, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to live here,&quot; and the melody is completely different. The eventual song, &quot;Theme from &quot;New York, New York&quot;&quot;, begins with one of Kander&#x27;s famous vamps, this one derived from the ragtime practice of putting the melody underneath a repeated note.

The song was released as a single from the soundtrack album and peaked at #104 on the Billboard chart. Two years later, Frank Sinatra recorded a cover version for his triple album &quot;&quot;. On June 14, 1980, the single reached #32 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was Sinatra&#x27;s last Top 40 hit. Both Sinatra&#x27;s and Minnelli&#x27;s versions have become closely associated with Manhattan in New York City. Sinatra performed the number at nearly all of his concerts until his retirement in 1995 and Minnelli continues to perform it at nearly all of hers.

===Soundtrack===
The soundtrack for &quot;New York, New York&quot; was a double album. It was produced, conducted, and arranged by Ralph Burns.

&quot;Happy Endings&quot; was recorded for the film but edited out of the theatrical release.

===Charts===
==Reception==
===Box office===
The film underperformed at the box-office, grossing only $16.4 million at the box office against a $9 million budget. The disappointment depressed Scorsese and worsened his drug addiction. Certain that &quot;New York, New York&quot; would be a hit, United Artists structured the film&#x27;s box office as a bulwark against the flop they expected in &quot;Rocky&quot;. The two productions pooled their profits, but &quot;Rocky&quot; ended up covering the losses of Scorsese&#x27;s movie.

In his introduction to the film&#x27;s DVD, Scorsese explains that he intended the film, which he saw as an homage to the musicals of Classical Hollywood cinema, to break from the gritty realism for which he had become famous, hence the deliberately artificial sets and storyline. He then acknowledges the experiment did not please everyone.

===Critical response===
Christopher Porterfield wrote in &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;If this movie were a big-band arrangement, it would be a duet for a sax man and a girl singer, but with the soloists in a different key from the band.&quot; Vincent Canby wondered, &quot;Why should a man of Mr. Scorsese&#x27;s talent be giving us what amounts to no more than a film buff&#x27;s essay on a pop-film form that was never, at any point in film history, of the first freshness?&quot; Roger Ebert lamented, &quot;Scorsese&#x27;s New York, New York never pulls itself together into a coherent whole, but if we forgive the movie its confusions we&#x27;re left with a good time.&quot; In the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; Dave Kehr concluded, &quot;Scorsese created a very handsome and dynamic film, but the spectacular set pieces don&#x27;t add up to much.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; raved, &quot;a final burst from Old Hollywood, Minnelli tears into the title song and it&#x27;s a wowser.&quot; &quot;Time Out&#x27;s&quot; Geoff Andrew enthused, &quot;Scorsese&#x27;s tribute/parody/critique of the MGM musical is a razor-sharp dissection of the conventions of both meeting-cute romances and rags-to-riches biopics. Gene Shalit said that the argument between Francine and Jimmy in the parked car was the most realistic he had ever seen on film.

In &quot;Cinéaste&quot;, Leonard &amp; Barbara Quart called the film &quot;an interesting and at sometimes exciting failure...&quot; They pointed out the self-conscious parallels with the work of Liza&#x27;s mother in &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; and praised Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;stylized settings (gold tinsel snowfalls, claustrophobic reddish interiors, and spotlit, dream-like musical solos)&quot; but felt they were &quot;too calculated and without purpose&quot;. William Harding heaped blame on De Niro&#x27;s performance, &quot;[He] zooms in on the role as if he were playing Hamlet. His hard work backfires...The character of Jimmy Doyle is completely obscured by the spectacle of DeNiro attempting to come to grips with an impossibly one-note role.&quot;

The film has an overall critical score of 57% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 49 reviews; the site&#x27;s consensus explains, &quot;Martin Scorsese&#x27;s technical virtuosity and Liza Minelli&#x27;s magnetic presence are on full display in &quot;New York, New York&quot;, although this ambitious musical&#x27;s blend of swooning style and hard-bitten realism makes for a queasy mixture.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Theme from &quot;New York, New York&quot; – #31
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals – Nominated

==Stage musicals==
===Brazilian musical===
The film was adapted into a stage musical in Brazil. It premiered on April 14, 2011, in Teatro Bradesco in São Paulo, with direction by José Possi Neto. The songs were not translated, instead featuring subtitles projected on a digital panel.

===Broadway musical===

The film was adapted into a stage musical in the United States. It opened on Broadway on April 26, 2023 at the St. James Theater, following previews that began on March 24. The production received mixed reviews with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; saying the musical was &quot;...deeply flawed, but deeply entertaining...&quot; and Elisabeth Vincentelli of &quot;The New York Times&quot; saying the show was &quot;The Big Apple, Without Bite&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said &quot;the film is not good. The new Broadway musical is worse.&quot; Due to the poor reviews, lack of Tony Award wins, and high production costs, producers posted a hasty announcement on July 23, 2023 stating that the musical would close on July 30.

<text>CFTR (680 AM; “680 NewsRadio Toronto”) is a commercial all-news radio station licensed to Toronto, Ontario, serving the Greater Toronto Area. Owned by Rogers Radio, a division of the Rogers Sports &amp; Media subsidiary of Rogers Communications, the station became Canada&#x27;s first solo station to broadcast an all-news radio format, following in the footsteps of the CKO national all-news radio network, a format that has since been replicated in major markets across the country. The CFTR studios are located at the Rogers Building at Bloor and Jarvis Streets in downtown Toronto, while the station transmitter is located on the southern edge of Lake Ontario at Oakes and Winston Road (near the QEW and Casablanca Blvd) in nearby Grimsby.

While CFTR broadcasts at the maximum power for Canadian AM stations, 50,000 watts, it must use a complicated directional antenna system to avoid interfering with other stations on 680 AM. In addition to a standard analog transmission, CFTR is simulcast on the second HD digital subchannel of CKIS-FM, and is available online. Its audio simulcasts on Bell Satellite TV channel 958.

==History==
=== Early years ===
The station launched on August 8, 1962. Its original frequency was 1540 kHz, using the call sign CHFI, simulcasting the beautiful music of sister station CHFI-FM, one of Canada&#x27;s first FM radio stations. Because 1540 is a clear-channel frequency assigned to stations in the United States and the Bahamas, CHFI was authorized to broadcast only during the daytime. In 1963, it sought to pay CHLO in St. Thomas, Ontario to move from 680 to another frequency, to free up 680 for CHFI&#x27;s use. No deal was finalized, but, by 1966, the stations reached an agreement to share 680, and CHFI moved to 24-hour operation at that frequency.

In 1971, so as to distinguish itself from CHFI-FM, the station changed its callsign to CFTR; the &quot;TR&quot; being a tribute to Ted Rogers, Sr., radio pioneer and father of controlling shareholder Ted Rogers.

In 1972, CFTR abandoned the beautiful music simulcast of CHFI and adopted a Top 40 format. For many years, it was the primary competition to Toronto&#x27;s original Top 40 station, CHUM.

In 1973, programmer Chuck Camroux upped the ante in the Toronto radio &quot;Rock and Roll Wars&quot; by tweaking CFTR&#x27;s notoriously bad signal, adding some reverb, and hiring new morning man Jim Brady to rival CHUM&#x27;s Jay Nelson. Both stations hovered near one million listeners per week. Although Brady finally topped Nelson in the ratings in 1979, over-all, CFTR didn&#x27;t surpass CHUM in the Toronto BBM ratings until 1984. Once CFTR gained ratings supremacy, CHUM dropped Top 40 in favour of an adult contemporary music format in 1986.

CFTR also hired John Records Landecker from WLS in Chicago in 1981. Landecker spent two years at the station before returning to Chicago to work at WLUP. In 1983, CFTR began broadcasting in AM stereo using the Kahn/Hazeltine C-QUAM system, and then switched to the Motorola stereo system.

===All-news era===

Through the 1980s and 1990s, music listeners switched to FM, prompting AM stations like CFTR to find non-music formats. On June 1, 1993, at 10 am, CFTR announced it would be discontinuing the Top 40 format, and began broadcasting a countdown of &quot;the top 500 songs of the (then) past 25 years&quot; titled &quot;The CFTR Story&quot;. At 6 am on June 7, after playing Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;Against All Odds&quot; (which was the #1 song in the countdown) and Starship&#x27;s &quot;We Built This City&quot; (which also ended CHUM&#x27;s Top 40 era in 1986), and the station stopped broadcasting in AM stereo, CFTR adopted its present all-news radio format as &quot;680 News&quot;. It was the first all-news radio station in Canada since the end of the former CKO network in 1989.

The station offers listeners a &quot;weather guarantee&quot; jackpot, which is drawn from a pool of listeners who enter the contest.

In June 2021, Rogers announced that it would rebrand its news radio stations under the &quot;CityNews&quot; brand to create a shared identity with local news on Citytv television stations and their corresponding smartphone app and website. The rebranding took effect on October 18, 2021, with the station rebranding as &quot;CityNews 680&quot;.

On March 25, 2024, as part of a reimaging of the &quot;CityNews&quot; brand, CFTR rebranded as &quot;680 NewsRadio Toronto&quot;.

<text>Max Reinhardt (30 November 1915 – 19 November 2002) was a British publisher. He published Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, George Bernard Shaw and Graham Greene.

==Biography==
Max Reinhardt was born on 30 November 1915 in Istanbul to Austrian parents. He attended an English High School in Istanbul. His parents set up an import and export business in London which he headed. After the Second World War he took a course in international relations at the London School of Economics. During a bridge game, he met A. S. Frere, who inspired him to change his import and export business into a publishing house. Reinhardt then bought HFL Publishers, a company that published Accounting textbooks.

Max Reinhardt&#x27;s first author was George Bernard Shaw, who reissued his romantic correspondence with the actress Ellen Terry. In 1957, Reinhardt and a banker partner bought the Bodley Head publishing house, where Reinhardt built a strong editing team, naming Graham Greene as director. Greene published his own novels there. They also published Alistair Cooke, Maurice Sendak, William Trevor and Eric Ambler. Bodley Head was purchased by Random House, and both Reinhardt and Greene resigned. Reinhardt kept ownership of HFL, renaming it Reinhardt Books which was later bought by Viking Press.

He died on 19 November 2002.

<doc id="1230950" wikidata="Q3129140" url="?curid=1230950" title="Heavier Things">
<text>Heavier Things is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter John Mayer, released on September 9, 2003 by Aware and Columbia Records. It debuted at #1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling over 317,000 copies in its first week. Despite some criticism towards Mayer&#x27;s songwriting, &quot;Heavier Things&quot; received generally positive reviews.

==Background==
Mayer felt he could be more relaxed focused on his art while making &quot;Heavier Things&quot;. With Jack Joseph Puig as producer, loops and horns were more prominently featured. Mayer took greater control of the creative side with this album; much of it was recorded in his New York City apartment. He also got final approval on all radio edits. Mayer explained that he did not want a &quot;big and bold&quot; title for the record and expressed that the name &quot;Heavier Things&quot; is &quot;what it is&quot; due to its &quot;insignificance&quot;. He further said that he likes the word &quot;things&quot; due to finding it &quot;nondescript and dumb, [...] kind of blunt&quot;.

Columbia Records used a conservative marketing campaign to promote the album. Columbia Records Group president Will Botwin says, &quot;We think we&#x27;re being smart. It&#x27;s a long-term project. We understand what we&#x27;re creating is a career. Effectively, that&#x27;s the message: Keep the hype at bay.&quot; In keeping with that gameplan, the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Bigger Than My Body&quot;, only went to radio a few weeks before the album&#x27;s release; promotional broadcasts of the album were limited to MTV.com and Mayer&#x27;s official site, both of whom began streaming the complete album the September 2 before its release. Scheduled television appearances included &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on October 4 and several late shows. Columbia Records thought it was important to put Mayer in talk show-type scenarios before the album release to help bring focus to his art and to his singer/songwriter career, and to steer away from the fame and celebrity hype.

==Singles==
Despite being &quot;delayed&quot; on the radio, the lead single &quot;Bigger Than My Body&quot; gained commercial and critical success. &quot;Clarity&quot; was the second single released from &quot;Heavier Things&quot;. Although the song receives rare airplay, it is one of Mayer&#x27;s fan favorites, and is normally performed at Mayer&#x27;s concerts. The song received very positive reviews from critics, mostly being praised for its relaxing style and beat.

&quot;Daughters&quot; was the last single released from &quot;Heavier Things&quot;. The song has become a huge commercial success, and has received largely positive reviews: several critics called the song as Mayer&#x27;s best yet.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics; it holds an aggregate score of 67/100 at Metacritic. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine stated that it &quot;firmly establishes him as a legitimate--albeit still puppy-eyed--singer/songwriter.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; writer Allison Stewart gave the album a favorable review and wrote that Mayer &quot;[has] crafted a sturdy, soulful pop album that credibly expands upon — but never abandons — his core sound&quot;. Despite writing that &quot;his self-conscious lyrics can get in the way&quot;, Russell Baillie of &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; praised Mayer&#x27;s musicianship and gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s James Hunter called &quot;Heavier Things&quot; an &quot;equally available yet more sophisticated album&quot; than &quot;Room for Squares&quot;. In his own review for &quot;Esquire&quot;, Mayer gave the album a &quot;B minus&quot;, adding, &quot;Am I the only one who finds this record creepy to make out to?&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; said, &quot;Sadly, Mayer&#x27;s idea of a good time involves hiring jazz musicians to make himself sound like &#x27;80s James Taylor.&quot;

===Accolades===
Mayer earned his first number-one single with &quot;Daughters&quot; as well as a 2005 Grammy for Song of the Year, beating out fellow contenders Hoobastank, Alicia Keys, Tim McGraw, and Kanye West. He dedicated the award to his grandmother, Annie Hoffman, who died in May 2004. He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, beating Elvis Costello, Josh Groban, Prince, and Seal for the award. At the 37th Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in 2006, Mayer was honored with the Hal David Starlight Award.

<doc id="1230968" wikidata="Q723053" url="?curid=1230968" title="Barney McKenna">
<text>Bernard Noël &quot;Banjo Barney&quot; McKenna (16 December 1939 – 5 April 2012) was an Irish musician and a founding member of The Dubliners. He played the tenor banjo, violin, mandolin, and melodeon. He was most renowned as a banjo player.

==Biography==
Born in Donnycarney, Dublin, McKenna played the banjo from an early age, beginning because he could not afford to buy the instrument of his choice, a mandolin. He was a member of The Dubliners from 1962 and was the only living member of the original (1962) formation at the time of his death. Prior to joining the Dubliners, he had spent a few months in The Chieftains. In addition to his work on traditional Irish music, he also played jazz on occasion.

==Artistic performance==
Barney used GDAE tuning on a 17-fret tenor banjo, an octave below fiddle/mandolin and, according to musician Mick Moloney, was single-handedly responsible for making the GDAE-tuned tenor banjo the standard banjo in Irish music.

Barney remained a great favourite with live audiences, and some of the loudest and most affectionate applause followed the tunes and songs on which he was the featured performer. He was well known for his unaccompanied renditions of songs such as &#x27;South Australia&#x27; and &#x27;I Wish I Had Someone to Love Me&#x27;. His banjo solos on tunes such as &#x27;The Maid Behind the Bar&#x27;, &#x27;The High Reel&#x27; and &#x27;The Mason&#x27;s Apron&#x27;, where he was usually accompanied by Eamonn Campbell on guitar, were often performed to cries of &quot;C&#x27;mon Barney!&quot; from audience or band members. Another featured spot in Dubliners performances is the mandolin duet that Barney played with John Sheahan – again with Eamonn Campbell providing guitar accompaniment. As Barney often pointed out to the audience: &quot;It&#x27;s an Irish duet, so there&#x27;s three of us going to play it&quot;.

Barney&#x27;s tendency to relate funny, and often only marginally believable, stories was legendary amongst Dubliners fans and friends. These anecdotes became known as Barneyisms, and Barney&#x27;s friend, and former Dubliners bandmate, Jim McCann collected them for the book &quot;An Obstacle Confusion: The Wonderful World of Barney McKenna&quot;.

==Personal life==
McKenna was a keen fisherman, and many of the songs he has recorded with The Dubliners have been shanties and nautical ballads.

In 2006, McKenna suffered a mild stroke, which caused him to lose his sight in one eye, and have difficulty walking.

McKenna is mentioned several times in the song &#x27;O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s&#x27; by Andy Irvine, which describes the Dublin traditional music scene of the early-to-mid 1960s that found a spiritual home in O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s Pub in Dublin&#x27;s Merrion Row.
==Death==
McKenna died unexpectedly on the morning of 5 April 2012 after collapsing in the kitchen of his home in Howth, County Dublin. He was buried at St Loman&#x27;s Cemetery in Trim, County Meath, on 9 April 2012.
At first it was unclear whether The Dubliners would continue their 50th Anniversary Tour in the wake of McKenna&#x27;s death. However they soon confirmed that they would &quot;do their best to honour all the concert dates for the rest of the year [2012]&quot;.

<doc id="1230969" wikidata="Q430712" url="?curid=1230969" title="Charles William Miller">
<text>Charles William Miller (24 November 1874 – 30 June 1953; ) was a Brazilian sportsman, who is considered to be the father of football in Brazil. Miller founded São Paulo Athletic Club (SPAC), one of the oldest sports club in Brazil, and found the &quot;Liga Paulista de Foot-Ball&quot;, current Campeonato Paulista, Brazil&#x27;s first football league. He is also considered the father of Rugby union in Brazil.

==Early life==
He was born in São Paulo to John Miller, a Scottish railway engineer and Brazilian mother of English descent, Carlota Fox.

In 1884 he was sent to the Banister Court public school in Southampton, England where he learnt to play football and cricket. Whilst at school, he played for and against both the Corinthians and St. Mary&#x27;s (now Southampton FC). He was recorded in the 1891 United Kingdom census whilst a boarder at Millbrook School.

==Influence==

When he returned to Brazil in 1894, Miller brought two footballs and a set of Hampshire FA rules in his suitcase. Miller was instrumental in setting up the football team of the São Paulo Athletic Club (SPAC) and the Liga Paulista, the first football league in Brazil. With him as striker SPAC won the first three championships in 1902, 1903 and 1904.

By 1906, Miller was playing in goal and as such participated in SPAC&#x27;s heaviest defeat, 9–1 to Sport Club Internacional of São Paulo (not to be confused with Sport Club Internacional). After the result SPAC resigned from the league as did Miller from its directorate. SPAC eventually came back in 1907, even winning the 1911 title, and continued competing in the Campeonato Paulista until 1912, when it withdrew from official competitions.

It was Miller who suggested the name to the first President of Sport Club Corinthians Paulista.

==Personal life==

Miller worked at the São Paulo Railway Company, becoming the Royal Mail&#x27;s agent and Acting British Vice-Consul in 1904. He invested in the construction of garden suburbs in São Paulo, designed by Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin, profiting considerably.

In January 1906, he married the renowned pianist Antonietta Rudge, with whom he had two children, Carlos (b. 1907) and Helena (b. 1909). In the late 1920s the couple split and Antonietta moved in with the poet Menotti Del Picchia.

In 1939, on perhaps his last return to England, he was nearly killed in the first IRA bombing on the mainland; his daughter stopped to window shop just seconds before the bomb went off on the steps to the nearby underground station.

He continued to play cricket and golf in later life. He died on 30 June 1953 in São Paulo, and is buried in the Protestant cemetery there.

<text>The Beijing Bailie University (BBU; ), previously known in English as Peili Vocational Institute, is a university in Beijing.

Founded in May, 1983, the Beijing Bailie University is one of the earliest non-governmental institutions of higher education officially approved by the Beijing Municipal People&#x27;s Government, and documented by the Ministry of Education of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is a full-time vocational college for various professional training, including foreign language, computing, law, accounting, international business, art, and hospitality departments. BBU&#x27;s qualified to independently issue diplomas and certificates which are recognized by the Chinese government. There are currently more than 7,000 students in total.

==Founded by Rewi Alley==
BBU was founded by Rewi Alley and is named after Joseph Bailie. Its history dates back to the resistance to the Japanese invasion of China. Alley&#x27;s role continues to be is acknowledged with his likeness appearing on the top of the home page of the BBU website together with his motto for the school which was &#x27;train for the dawn&#x27; of the New China. The name Beijing Bailie University came from a proposal of Alley who was committed to promoting the educational thought of integrating study with practice initiated by an old American educator Joseph Bailie in China. Alley and his close friend Dr. George Hatem were the first two honorary presidents of the university. They hoped that the traditional spirit of the old Shandan Bailie School created in wartime would be passed on in China through the generations.

The university also adopted the old Shandan school motto of &#x27;Hands and mind, create and analyze&#x27; as the university&#x27;s motto. The university has played a significant role in practicing and exploring China&#x27;s structural reform of higher education, being acknowledged as of one of the more influential non-governmental universities in Beijing and throughout China. Up until 2011, BBU&#x27;s had trained more than 20,000 qualified graduates.

==Visit by Premier Wen Jiabao==
On April 12, 2008, Premier Wen Jiabao inscribed the university motto ‘Hands and mind, create and analyze’ formulated by two great friends of China, Rewi Alley from New Zealand, and George Hogg from Britain who established the Bailie Technical School in Shandan, Gansu Province in early 1940s. Premier Wen also wrote a letter in reply to BBU&#x27;s students in which he affirmed the successes of the Beijing Bailie University.

==Agreement with New Zealand China Friendship Society==
On September 3, 2011, BBU signed an agreement with the New Zealand China Friendship Society (NZCFS) which included two-way academic exchange and reception of visitors and delegations, and promotion of New Zealand and BBU as centres of excellence for study. The agreement was signed by BBU President Yu Lin and NZCFS Vice President Dave Bromwich. At the signing Bromwich acknowledged the significance of the legacy Rewi Alley has left for the relationship between the people of New Zealand and China, in the Gung Ho cooperative movement and in the Bailie Education system.

<text>Joseph P. Sulzer is an American Democratic politician, and was mayor of Chillicothe, Ohio.

Sulzer served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Ohio University and was awarded a Juris Doctor degree by Capital University Law School.

Returning to Chillicothe, Sulzer was elected to the city council, where he served for six years. In 1987, Sulzer became mayor of Chillicothe.

In 1992, Sulzer entered the Democratic primary contest for the United States House of Representatives in Ohio&#x27;s sixth congressional district. He lost that primary race to Ted Strickland.

Sulzer served as Chillicothe mayor until 1996. In 1997, Sulzer was appointed to fill out the term of a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives that had become vacant. While serving in the legislature, Chillicothe city council member Margaret Planton was appointed his successor as mayor. Sulzer won re-election to his Ohio House of Representatives seat in 1998 and 2000. However, in 2002, Sulzer was unseated by Republican John M. Schlichter.

In 2003, Sulzer again ran for the office of Chillicothe mayor. He won the Democratic primary. In the general election, he defeated city council member Diane Carnes, getting 55 percent of the vote.

In August 2005, Sulzer announced that he would run for the US House seat (OH-18) held by Republican Bob Ney. In March 2006, Sulzer called for Ney to step down if explicitly named by Jack Abramoff as someone guilty of corruption.

On May 2, 2006, Sulzer lost the primary election for the Democratic nomination in the Ohio 18th to attorney Zack Space. Space got 39% of the vote, Jennifer Stewart 25%, and Sulzer 24%.

In November 2007 Sulzer was re-elected to the office of Mayor in Chillicothe. He defeated former City Council-At-Large Diane Carnes in a crushing victory that helped win the local Democratic Party majority control of City Council with the election of new Council members.

In 2008, Sulzer controversially backed a measure that would install red-light cameras at several intersections in the city and the idea won passage in City Council. They were installed in October 2008, but city residents had them taken down after voting in a favor of a no-red light camera referendum in November 2009.

In 2010, Sulzer unsuccessfully campaigned for Judge of the Ross County Court of Common Pleas, losing to Mike Ater in a three-way race that also included Mark Preston. Sulzer finished third in the race with just 18 percent of the vote.

In 2011, he announced that he would retire from public service at the end of the year and his term as mayor. He is now a private practice attorney.

<text>John G. Nelson (14 May 1928 – 28 February 2003) was an American police officer with the Los Angeles Police Department who is considered to be the founding father of the SWAT (Special Weapons And Tactics) concept. 

After the Watts riots of 1965, Sergeant Nelson personally approached LAPD chief William Parker with his proposal for a SWAT unit. Nelson had served in the United States Marine Corps and based the SWAT concept on the Recon units, believing that a small squad of highly trained police officers armed with special weapons would be more effective in a riotous situation than a massive police response.

Chief Parker liked the proposal and presented it to his command staff. He asked for a volunteer to form the SWAT unit. Fearing a political backlash, no one on his command staff was willing to volunteer, including Daryl Gates. Parker then told Nelson to go ahead and form the SWAT unit himself, which he did.

<doc id="1230982" wikidata="Q2457059" url="?curid=1230982" title="Sengoku (1991 video game)">
<text>Sengoku is a beat &#x27;em up arcade game. It is the first entry of the &quot;Sengoku&quot; trilogy by SNK. It was ported to numerous home consoles including the Neo Geo, Neo Geo CD, Mega-CD and Super Famicom. The arcade version was part of &quot;SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1&quot;, released in 2008. The Neo Geo version was re-released on the Japanese Virtual Console in 2011, with the sequels for the North American Virtual Console on November 8, 2012 (Sengoku 2) and June 6, 2013 (Sengoku 3) and for the PAL region on February 7, 2013 (&quot;Sengoku 2&quot;) and September 5, 2013 (&quot;Sengoku 3&quot;). In 2009 the series was compiled on the &quot;Sengoku Anthology&quot; for PlayStation 2 and Windows.

==Gameplay==

A player has a maximum of six health points. When certain enemies are defeated, spirits of powerful forms are available to transform into. In the SNES version transformation cannot be toggled, but stays constant for a limited time. The three different forms are a samurai, an armor-clad wolf and a more agile ninja. These forms have a limited use. Their attacks and jumps differ from the original form and their powers are enhanced by any power-ups collected.

Throughout the game the player would need to survive the hordes of enemies by collecting colored orbs as power-ups. Ten Green orbs heal one health point. A Red orb gives the player a single sword, a Cyan orb gives the player a dual swords, the Purple orb gives the player a two-handed holy sword and a Yellow orb gives the player a limited magical attack. All swords are equally powerful and have no unique abilities over another. Although the magical projectiles is finite and can be deflected, it&#x27;s the only one that does not clash into combat during sword fights.

==Plot==
Centuries ago a cruel and insanely tyrannical warlord was defeated by the two elite Samurai but had sworn to return in the future. When he does he unleashes undead forces of feudal Japanese warriors to destroy the world and its people. The warlord is opposed only by the two protagonists, the red-jacketed Claude Yamamoto and cowboy hat-wearing Jack Stone (also known as Dan and Bill in the SNES version), martial artists who turn out to be descendants of the two elite Samurai responsible for vanquishing the wicked warlord centuries ago.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Sengoku&quot; on their March 15, 1991 issue as being the thirteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the month. Likewise, &quot;RePlay&quot; reported &quot;Sengoku&quot; to be the fourth most-popular arcade game at the time.

On release, &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; scored the Neo Geo version of the game a 19 out of 40. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the Super NES version a 4.4 out of 10, commenting that it &quot;has an interesting concept as you can change into different types of fighters, yet it just doesn&#x27;t come together.&quot; Power Unlimited gave the Neo Geo version a score of 85% writing: &quot;A top-shelf brawler, even for people who aren&#x27;t much of a fighter. The game gives you a real fighting feeling, thanks to the great sounds and images.&quot;

<doc id="1230985" wikidata="Q3066797" url="?curid=1230985" title="Zamanfou">
<text>Zamanfou, also known as &quot;ochaderfismos&quot; (&quot;Greek &quot;ωχαδερφισμός&quot;&quot;) is a widely accepted as prevalent attitude/approach to life in Greece that is nevertheless classed by some as a counterculture phenomenon, which involves social loafing as its principal characteristic.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from the French phrase &quot;je m&#x27;en fous&quot; (&quot;foutre&quot;). The French expression &quot;Je m&#x27;en fous&quot; became known by the Greeks before World War II, when the French language was the most common foreign language in Greece. It was later adopted into everyday slang vocabulary, with Greek spelling and pronunciation. It is roughly equivalent to the English &#x27;I don&#x27;t care&#x27;.

The associated term &quot;ochaderfismos&quot; derives from the Greek phrase &quot;oh brother!&quot; (ωχ αδερφέ!).

==Background==
Although zamanfou might be considered a social phenomenon in Greece, it is no different from social loafing, as this appears in other cultures or epochs.

==Zamanfou in popular culture==
*&quot;Zamanfou&quot; is the title of a Greek song by Sakis Boulas.
*&quot;Zamanfou&quot; is the title of a Greek hip-hop song by the rapper Eisvoleas.
*&quot;Zamanfou&quot; was the title of a Greek TV show by Annita Pania.
*&quot;Zamanfou&quot; is the title of a Greek hip-hop song by the rapper Taraxias featuring Sakis Boulas and Vasia Patrikarea (new version of the Sakis Boulas song).

<doc id="1230988" wikidata="Q2467106" url="?curid=1230988" title="Freddy's Nightmares">
<text>Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares (also known as A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Series) is an American horror anthology television series that aired in syndication from October 1988 until March 1990. A spin-off from the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film series, each episode is introduced by Freddy Krueger (played by Robert Englund, as in the films) and features two different stories. Eight episodes throughout the series actually feature Freddy Krueger as the main antagonist. The pilot episode, directed by Tobe Hooper, begins with Krueger&#x27;s prosecution on child-murdering charges.

The series was produced by New Line Television, and Stone Television. It was originally distributed by Lorimar-Telepictures. After Lorimar-Telepictures was acquired by Warner Bros. Television in 1989, Warner Bros. assumed syndication rights.

==Premise==
Due to the murderous nature of Freddy Krueger, New Line Cinema opted not to develop a television series with a regular cast of characters interacting with Krueger continuously, as he would inevitably kill most of them, leaving no one left. Instead, the producers created an anthology series, featuring a new cast of actors for each episode.

Each episode tells a different story with dark or grim themes, set in the fictional town of Springwood, Ohio, specifically on Elm Street, the same setting as the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; films. Although the Freddy Krueger character occasionally plays a role in the plot, most of the stories do not involve him directly. However, it is often hinted that Krueger indirectly influenced the desolate nature of the plotlines.

Similar to the Crypt Keeper in &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, Krueger&#x27;s primary function is to host the series. He appears in regular bumper segments, offering ominous or slapstick reactions to the episode&#x27;s events, culminating in a quick and usually eerie epilogue at the end.

One unique element of the series is its two-tier story approach. Most episodes feature two different stories, each occupying the first and second halves of the episode. The second story usually builds on a character who played a minor or supporting role in the first.

Several episodes throughout the second season form mini-arcs, where the events of one episode are followed up and/or referenced in a later episode. For example, the episode &quot;Interior Loft&quot; was given a direct sequel, &quot;Interior Loft-Later,&quot; and &quot;Lucky Stiff&quot; was followed up with &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go.&quot;

Torrance High School was used as the filming location for Springwood High School, predating its use in later horror series like &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

==Cast==
The only actor from the film series retained for the TV series was Robert Englund, as Freddy Krueger.

Some of the featured actors who went on to later become notable were:

* Rosalind Allen
* Robin Antin
* Shiri Appleby
* Sarah Buxton
* Bill Camp
* Kyle Chandler
* Morris Chestnut
* Clifton Collins Jr.
* Raymond Cruz

===DVD &amp; Blu-ray===
In 2003, Volume 1 (the first 3 episodes) was released on Region 2 DVD in Ireland and the UK, by Warner Home Video. Volume 2 and Volume 3 was also planned to be released later in future years to come, however, Warner canceled the releases due to poor sales.

In 2011, a Blu-ray collection of the original seven &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; films was released in the US. The set included a DVD with special features, which included two episodes of the show (&quot;It&#x27;s a Miserable Life&quot; and &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;).

In 2022, sixteen german dubbed episodes were published in Germany by Pidax.

==Syndication==
The series originally aired in syndication across the United States. Due to its violent and sexual content, episodes were often heavily edited before being broadcast. A notable example is the series finale, &quot;Safe Sex,&quot; which had 8 minutes of explicit footage removed.

In 2006, AOL partnered with Warner Bros. Television to make &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot; available on its new broadband service, In2TV.

NBCUniversal&#x27;s horror-themed cable channel, Chiller, aired monthly marathons of &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot;. Both seasons were shown consecutively with commercial breaks, but the channel stopped airing the series on March 31, 2011.

In the UK, Sky and Virgin Media customers could watch the entire first series on Zone Horror, airing one episode per night at 8 PM, starting June 8, 2009.

In Sweden, TV4 Guld aired the show weekly from 2010 to 2012.

El Rey Network began airing the series on November 3, 2015.

As of February 15, 2022, the series became available on Screambox, a streaming service focused on horror content.

As of 2024, &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot; is not available on Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s streaming service, Max. Instead, it is now streaming on Tubi, a free, ad-supported platform owned by Fox Corporation.

==Reception==
Mark Pellegrini of &quot;Adventures in Poor Taste&quot; gave the show an overall rating of 6 out of 10. In his review, he explains that only 8 out of the 44 episodes focus on Freddy Krueger, which influenced his rating. Among these, &quot;Photo Finish&quot; received the highest praise, while &quot;Safe Sex&quot; was deemed the weakest. The episode &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; was seen as paying homage to the first five &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; films. However, he notes that the scene where Freddy is burned alive, depicted in this episode, is shown differently in &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; and &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot;, made decades later.

John Kenneth Muir in his book &quot;Terror Television&quot; (2001) placed &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot; as the worst of the horror television programs between 1970 and 1999. Muir found the series having uninteresting stories and that its production was so low that it appeared to be homemade, and that it wasted the talents of Englund.

==Legacy==
The genesis of the series and its impact were later revisited in the 2010 documentary &quot;Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy&quot;, which features interviews with a number of the show&#x27;s writers, directors and other parties involved like original Elm Street director Wes Craven and New Line producer Bob Shaye. The Blu-ray release of the documentary includes outtakes from the series as well as footage that was deleted due to it being too graphic for television.

<doc id="1230993" wikidata="Q649114" url="?curid=1230993" title="Patrick Street">
<text>Patrick Street is an Irish folk group founded by Kevin Burke (formerly of The Bothy Band) on fiddle, Andy Irvine (Sweeney&#x27;s Men, Planxty) on mandolin, bouzouki, harmonica and vocals, Jackie Daly (De Dannan) on button accordion, and Arty McGlynn (Van Morrison) on guitar.

Other members were added at various times: Ged Foley (The House Band, Battlefield Band) who held the tenure on guitar for many years, Bill Whelan on keyboards, Declan Masterson on uilleann pipes and keyboards, James Kelly on fiddle, Brendan Hearty on harmonium, John Carty on fiddle, flute and banjo, and Enda Walsh on keyboards.

Dónal Lunny, Whelan, and Walsh joined as producers on some albums.

==History==
In 1985, Andy Irvine joined up with fiddler Kevin Burke and guitarist Mícheál Ó Domhnaill (who had been gigging together around America for some time) and toured as a trio in the USA; when Ó Domhnaill wasn&#x27;t available for some of the dates, guitarist/vocalist Gerry O&#x27;Beirne stepped in.

&quot;This tour was such fun and so successful that we decided to expand the outfit into a four-piece by adding Jackie Daly&quot;, Irvine wrote.

Originally billed on a 1986 American tour as &quot;The Legends of Irish Music&quot;, they soon chose to call themselves Patrick Street. The line-up for the band underwent several changes, but always included Burke, Irvine and Daly.

The guitar role, however, passed:
*from O&#x27;Beirne to Arty McGlynn – before the recording of their first album, &quot;Patrick Street&quot;, which began in August 1986;
*from McGlynn to Ged Foley – after the band recorded their fourth album, &quot;All in Good Time&quot;, released in 1993; 
*back to McGlynn – when they resumed touring after the completion of their ninth album, &quot;On the Fly&quot;, released in 2007.

After Daly retired from Patrick Street, John Carty joined on fiddle, flute and tenor banjo in time to record &quot;On the Fly&quot;.

Patrick Street was originally conceived as a part-time band, nevertheless they have recorded nine studio albums and one live album.

==Music for a Found Harmonium==
The song was included on the Green Linnet 20th Anniversary, 2-CD collection of various artists, issued in 1996.

In 2004, Patrick Street&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Music for a Found Harmonium&quot; (originally composed by Simon Jeffes from The Penguin Cafe Orchestra), was used near the end of the movie &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;. It was also used in the 1991 film &quot;Hear My Song&quot;.

In 2008, the furniture company MFI also used Patrick Street&#x27;s cover of &quot;Music for a Found Harmonium&quot; as the soundtrack of a TV advertisement.

In 2009, Topic Records included &quot;Music for a Found Harmonium&quot; from &quot;Irish Times&quot; as track fifteen on the first CD (&quot;Disk one&quot;) of their 70-year anniversary boxed set &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot;.

<text>Basic lead acetate, also known as subacetate of lead, is the inorganic compound with the formula Pb3(OH)4(O2CCH3)2. A white solid, it is one of several lead acetates.

==History==
Goulard&#x27;s extract is a solution of lead(II) acetate and lead(II) oxide used as an astringent during the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. It was named after its introducer, Thomas Goulard. Lead poisoning and the development of more effective astringents caused doctors to abandon its use. Synonymous or very closely related formulations were known as &quot;liquor plumbi subacetis dilutus&quot;, &quot;eau de Goulard&quot;, extract of Saturn, vinegar of Saturn, and liquid acetate of lead. The white water &quot;eau de Saturne&quot; differed from &quot;eau de Goulard&quot; in not containing alcohol, but was often confused with it. Goulard&#x27;s Extract was a primary ingredient in both Goulard&#x27;s Cerate and Goulard&#x27;s Water.

<text>Pensford is the largest village in the civil parish of Publow in Somerset, England. It lies in the Chew Valley, approximately south of Bristol, west of Bath, and north of Wells. It is on the A37 road from Bristol to Shepton Mallet.

Pensford was identified as being of special architectural and historic interest and was designated as a Conservation Area in May 1988.

==History==

The name Pensford is in all likelihood derived from Brythonic &quot;Penffordd&quot;, meaning roughly &#x27;top of the road&#x27; or &#x27;the highest or furthest point of the road&#x27;. Alternatively, it may mean &#x27;The animal pens by the ford&#x27; from the Old English &quot;pens&quot; and &quot;ford&quot;.

The parish of Pensford was part of the Keynsham Hundred,

During the 14th to 16th centuries Pensford was a cloth centre based on local wool.

On 24 June 1685 rebel forces camped at Pensford during the Monmouth Rebellion.

===Coal mining===
During the 19th and 20th centuries, the main industry was coal mining, with Pensford and the surrounding area forming a major part of the Somerset coalfield. Pensford and Bromley Collieries Ltd opened Pensford colliery to mine the Pensford syncline in 1909. By 1947, the mines output was 70,000 tons per annum. The colliery was connected by a spur of the North Somerset Railway .

The mine was prone to flooding and coal dust explosions. In 1931, Parliament discussed the safety record of the Somerset coalfield showing that between 1927 and 1930, 206 minors were injured in accidents, and 2 minors died at the colliery. In the early 1920s, the Minors Welfare Institute was founded and paid for by the miners. The Institute helped widows and held benevolent events. 

The mine was deemed uneconomical and closed in 1955. Its sight was used as the depot for Filer&#x27;s Coaches and was later converted to residential property. 

===1968 Floods===
The River Chew suffered a major flood in 1968 with serious damage to towns and villages along its route. The flood swept away the bridge over the A37 and damaged the railway viaduct so badly that it never reopened. On 10–11 July, a storm brought heavy rainfall to the valley, with falling in 18 hours on Chew Stoke, double the area&#x27;s average rainfall for the whole of July.

==Government and politics==
Pensford and Publow has its own parish council which has some responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.

It is part of the Publow and Whitchurch Ward which is represented by one councillor on the Bath and North East Somerset Unitary Authority which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary, and the Great Western Ambulance Service.

Bath and North East Somerset&#x27;s area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Clutton Rural District.

The village falls within the Publow and Whitchurch electoral ward. From &quot;Pensford&quot; the ward strikes north to end at Whitchurch on the Bristol border. The total population of this ward taken from the 2011 census was 2,473.

The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset and Hanham. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

==Demographics==
According to the 2001 Census, the Publow and Whitchurch Ward (which includes Belluton and Publow), had 1,087 residents, living in 429 households, with an average age of 40.8 years. Of these 73% of residents describing their health as &#x27;good&#x27;, 24% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 2.3% of all economically active people aged 16–74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 26,408 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.

==Buildings==

===St Thomas à Becket Church===

First built in the 14th century, the St Thomas à Becket Church is a Grade II* listed building 

Following damage in the 1968 floods the church was deconsecrated. During the 1980s an attempt was made to turn it into an arts centre but this was abandoned when the extent of the repairs required to make the building safe became clear. In 2007 the church was put on the market for redevelopment, and in 2008 purchased for repair and use as a private dwelling. The redevelopment of the church into a private dwelling was featured in the first episode of television series &quot;Restoration Home&quot;.

===The lock-up===

Pensford has an octagonal eighteenth-century village lock-up. This is a Grade II listed building and is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.
===Pubs===

Pensford has three pubs: the &quot;Travellers Rest&quot;, the &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, and the &quot;George and Dragon&quot;. During the 17th and 18th centuries Pensford was an important staging post for stage coaches which stopped at the &quot;George and Dragon&quot; and the &quot;Rising Sun&quot;. The &quot;George and Dragon&quot; dates from 1752 and is a Grade II listed building.
===Other Grade II listed buildings===

* 149 High Street
* Bridge House
* Bridge over the River Chew
* Gill&#x27;s G.V. Shoe Shop
* 129-131 High Street
* Old Bakery
* Guy&#x27;s Farm
* Viaduct View

The village&#x27;s war memorial is also grade II listed and commemorates the seven people from the village who died in each of World War I and World War II. It is a wheel cross, with a Celtic-style carving.

For centuries Pensford has been an important crossing point on the River Chew. The modern road bridge was rebuilt in 1968 after flood damage, but the much older (1839–85) bridge, by the church, survived the flood.

On the western side of the village is Pensford Viaduct on the disused Bristol and North Somerset Railway, built in 1873 but closed to trains in 1968 after the great flood of Pensford, after which it was deemed unsafe. The last passenger train had been earlier: the 9:25 a.m. from Frome to Bristol on 31 October 1959; after that there were only goods trains (mainly bringing coal from Radstock), which ceased in 1964, and very occasional excursion trains. Pensford viaduct is 995 feet (303 m) long, reaches a maximum height of 95 feet (29 m) to rail level and consists of sixteen arches. The viaduct is now a Grade II listed building.

==Surrounding area==

Nearby is Lord&#x27;s Wood, Pensford, and the village is on the route of the Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance footpath.

The town lies on the banks of the Mureș River, at an altitude of above sea level. The river with the same name (Geoagiu) and the river Romos flow in this place into the Mureș. Geoagiu is located in the eastern part of Hunedoara County, north of the city of Orăștie and east of the county seat, Deva, on the border with Alba County. 

The A1 motorway and the national road DN7 (which link Bucharest with the Banat region, in western Romania) pass though the southern side of the town. The Aurel Vlaicu and Geoagiu train stations serve the CFR Main Line 200, running in the same direction.

==History==

The first settlements in the area can be found in the time of the Dacians, in the 1st century BC, as shown by archeological discoveries. After the Roman conquest, the Romans built the fort of Germisara in the 2nd century, however, it kept the original Dacian name.

The name of &quot;Germisara&quot; meant &quot;hot water&quot; (&quot;germi&quot; = &quot;heat&quot;, &quot;sara&quot; = &quot;waterfall&quot;) and it showed that the Dacians already knew of the thermal springs of the area. Another opinion that the name came from the Hungarian name of the Geoagiu River (&quot;Gyógy&quot;), which means &quot;curative&quot;. But more probably, the name is coming from the Hungarian word &quot;dió&quot; (nut as fruit) with the suffix -d, so, after the first documentary citation, &quot;villa Gyog&quot; from 1291 appeared as Dyod és Dyog (1397), Aldyogh (1407), Algyogh (1412), Aldyod (1439), Alsodyod alio nomine Alsoffalwa (around 1444).

The first documentary citation of Geoagiu (it was written as &quot;villa Gyog&quot;) was in the year 1291, when it was used as a land in the vicinity of &quot;Binținți&quot; (now the village &quot;Aurel Vlaicu&quot;).

There are remains of the old Roman road from Geoagiu to Geoagiu-Băi made of flat stones.

==Demographics==

At the 2011 census, Geoagiu had 5,049 inhabitants; of those, 89.7% were Romanians, 8.81% Roma, and 0.71% Hungarians. At the 2021 census, the town had a population of 5,087, of which 75.62% were Romanians and 14.53% Roma.

<doc id="1231000" wikidata="Q5018858" url="?curid=1231000" title="Calcot, Berkshire">
<text>Calcot, or Calcot Row, is a village in West Berkshire, England. Calcot is within the built-up area of Reading, located about out of the town centre, and straddles the historic A4 Bath Road. It sits between the hamlet of Horncastle and Junction 12 of the M4 motorway. 

Tilehurst is to the north, and the village of Theale is to the west, across the motorway. Its named neighbourhoods include Beansheaf Farm, Fords Farm and Calcot Place south of the centre developed in the early 21st century. It is contiguous with Reading and Theale.

==Local government==
Although now a suburb of Reading, Calcot is not within the Borough of Reading. Rather it is split between the civil parishes of Holybrook and Tilehurst Without, with that part of Calcot north of the Bath Road in Tilehurst parish and that part south in Holybrook parish. The whole of Holybrook parish and the part of Calcot within Tilehurst parish, form the Calcot electoral ward of the unitary authority of West Berkshire. Both parishes have elected parish councils and, together with the unitary authority, are responsible for different aspects of local government. Calcot is part of the Reading West parliamentary constituency.

==Statistics==
The Calcot ward of West Berkshire has an area of 324 ha and a total population of 9,093 living in 3,554 dwellings.

==Schools==
Calcot has two primary schools serving pupils aged 4 to 11. Serving the Beansheaf and Fords Farm communities to the south of the A4 Bath Road is Kennet Valley Primary School while north of the A4, both sharing the same grounds, are Calcot Junior School and Calcot Infant School, which incorporates a nursery. When children leave primary school at 11 they attend secondary schools in neighbouring villages.

==Places of interest==
Calcot Park is a large country house and estate, to the north east of Calcot. Over the years the estate has been the home to Peter Vanlore, Frances Kendrick, and to John Blagrave, a relative of the mathematician John Blagrave, who built the present house in 1759. Today the house has been converted into apartments and the grounds have become a golf course.

Calcot Mill is a former watermill on the Holy Brook. It was built on the site of a mill originally owned by Reading Abbey and has been converted into apartments. 

Pincent&#x27;s Kiln is an Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) on the western border of the area.

==Shopping==

Calcot is home to two large shopping complexes - the SavaCentre and the Pincents Lane Retail Park and has a car dealers between the two; all close to Junction 12 of the M4 motorway. In September 1981, an hypermarket, a BHS and Sainsbury&#x27;s joint enterprise, opened up. At the time, it was one of the largest hypermarkets in the United Kingdom. This store featured in the SavaCentre TV adverts in 1983. In 1989, Sainsbury&#x27;s bought out BHS&#x27;s 50% share in the partnership, and the following year the right side of the store was extended by to over . In August 1998, it was re-modelled, to provide a greater emphasis on food, at a cost £26m. The SavaCentre was downsized and re-branded as Sainsbury&#x27;s in 2005, with the extension being sold off to Next. A further refurbishment took place in 2008.

At the same time, the SavaCentre site was rebranded as the Calcot Retail Park, with branches of Sports Direct, Boots and McDonald&#x27;s opening up. In 2015, an Argos in-store concession opened up inside Sainsbury&#x27;s. However, the SavaCentre name is still more commonly used by the locals. On the other side of the car dealers, was the Pincents Lane Retail Park. This was anchored by a branch of Homebase, but also featuring a branch of Dunelm Mill, Carpetright, Utopia Nightclub and Reading Megabowl bowling alley. In 2015, the retail park was demolished (apart from the Dunelm Mill store) and a new branch of IKEA was opened in its place in July 2016. The original plan was for a three-storey store, but in the end a reduced store over two floors was built because of the growth in online shopping.

==Transport==
Calcot is east of the M4 motorway. Local bus services are provided by Reading Buses. The nearest railway stations are , and .

==Notable people==
In 1881 the American post-impressionist painter John Singer Sargent spent the summer with his family in the village.

<text>The Alabama Midland Railway was incorporated in Alabama and Georgia in 1887, and built a line from Bainbridge, Georgia, to a point near Montgomery, Alabama. The route was completed in 1890. It became part of the Plant System in 1894, and in 1901 it was merged into the Savannah, Florida and Western Railway.

== History ==

On July 2, 1880, the Montgomery and Southern Railway was created to construct a new railroad linking Montgomery to the Florida coast. The company completed around of narrow gauge track by September 18, 1882. The company was reorganized as the Montgomery and Florida Railway in May 1886, and reorganized a second time as the Northwest and Florida Railroad in 1888. In November 1888, the railroad reached Luverne, Alabama. Now totaling the line was converted to standard gauge by July 1889. The Alabama Terminal and Improvement Company, a subsidiary of the Alabama Midland Railway, controlled the railroad by 1889 and incorporated the line from Montgomery to Luverne into its own network.

In March 1887, the Alabama Midland Railway was chartered in Alabama, and chartered in Georgia in October of the same year as the Alabama Terminal and Improvement Company. The companies were created with the purpose of constructing a line connecting Montgomery and Bainbridge. The company was consolidated on October 28, 1888, and completed the entire between the two cities in 1890, including a branch from Sprague to Luverne, Alabama, built by the Northwest &amp; Florida Railroad, a distance of .

Two subsidiary railroads of the Alabama Midland were tasked with constructing branchlines, the Southwestern Alabama Railway and the Abbeville Southern Railway. The former reached Elba in 1898 and the latter connected Abbeville to Grimes, Alabama, by 1901.

After the completion of the Alabama Midland railroad it was acquired in July 1890 by Henry B. Plant of the Plant System and merged with the Savannah, Florida &amp; Western. Together the railroads formed a continuous mainline from Savannah to Montgomery, colloquially known as the &quot;bow line&quot; due to its distinctive shape.

The Atlantic Coast Line gained control of the Plant System on July 1, 1902 with the line becoming part of their Waycross—Montgomery Line. Ownership would remain with the ACL until its 1967 merger with Seaboard Air Line to form the Seaboard Coast Line and the mergers into the Seaboard System and CSX Transportation in 1983 and 1986 respectively. With the exception of the abandoned Luverne branch, all of the former Alabama Midland remains active today as part of the Dothan Subdivision of CSX Transportation and as part of two shortlines operating former branches, the Wiregrass Central on the remaining Elba branch, and the Bay Line over the Abbeville branch.

<text>The World Trade Center Mexico City, commonly known by its former name, Hotel de México, is a building complex located in the wealthy neighborhood of Colonia Nápoles in central Mexico City. Its most famous and recognizable feature is the 50-story, high Torre WTC, the biggest building in the local area. It is the third tallest building in Mexico City when including antenna, and at its roof height, it stands .

The complex includes a convention center, cultural center, parking facilities, a multi-screen cinema, a revolving 45th-floor luxury restaurant and 44th floor observation gallery, and a shopping center with a supermarket and a Sears (originally opened as a JCPenney, the first location outside of the USA) as an anchor tenant. It also includes a 22-floor hotel, and will share some amenities with the slightly taller 48-story Polyforum Tower, currently under construction.

Located on Avenida de los Insurgentes, the complex is served by the Poliforum station of the Metrobús Bus rapid transit system, located a few meters away. The station is named after the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros, a part of the WTC complex.

==History==
The WTC México began its existence as the Hotel de México, a building and complex that did not perform as intended.

Construction of the Hotel de México was in a lot called &quot;Parque de La Lama&quot; located in the Nápoles neighborhood (&quot;Spanish: Colonia Nápoles&quot;). The lot was set aside by real estate businessperson, José Jerónimo de La Lama in 1947. However, by 1966, when the project started, the owner and financial sponsor was Manuel Suárez y Suárez.

The Hotel de México project included a hotel building as well as a cultural center housing the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros and several other facilities aimed at making the complex a hub for business, culture, tourism, and architecture. Plans for the complex were presented at the 13th international architecture contest in Munich.

Projected to be ready for the 1968 Olympics, the project overran and exceeded its budget. Although the main tower was completed in 1972, it did not function as a hotel, due to political and economic reasons. The tower–as well as the rest of the complex–was left in an unfinished state, aside from the Polyforum.

In the mid-1980s, a project was started to turn the Hotel de México complex into an international business center. Mr. Suárez backed the idea, and although he died in 1988, the remodeling began with partial public funding in 1992. In 1995, the complex–now known as World Trade Center México–opened its doors with the tower functioning as an office building and convention center.

Floors 40 and 41 housed TV studios for Corporación de Noticias e Información, which operated XHTVM Canal 40. On May 19, 2005, these floors were evacuated after the beginning of a strike at CNI. Due to the legal cases that have followed CNI since 2005, the facilities have remained untouched since.

The WTC also houses the transmission facilities for XEW-FM, XEQ-FM, XEX-FM and XHFO-FM.

Most recently, the World Trade Center added a second theater: the 7,500-seat Pepsi Center WTC, which was completed in 2012. It is used primarily for concerts and stage shows.

=== Functions ===

WTC Tower has a seismic detector that monitors land movements to stop elevators during earthquakes.

The tower is managed by a system that controls the facilities and equipment. This includes the electrics, mechanical ventilation, sanitation, elevators and fire protection.

<text>Whitley is a suburb of the town of Reading, Berkshire, England. It is also an electoral ward of the Borough of Reading.

==Geography==
Whitley, commonly known as one of the larger suburbs of Reading, is bounded to the north and east by a ridge of high ground carrying the road to Shinfield, to the west by the valleys of the River Kennet and the Foudry Brook, and to the south by an ill-defined boundary with the suburb of Whitley Wood. The former main road to Basingstoke passes just to the west of the centre of Whitley, dividing largely residential areas to its east from a largely industrial zone to its west. The current A33 relief road to Basingstoke passes to the west of the industrial area, as does the parallel railway line. Between the relief road and Bennet Road and railway can be found the recent Green Park business park and the Madejski Stadium.

==History==
Historically, Whitley was a hamlet outside the Reading borough limits, but within the parish of the church of St Giles in Reading.

==Government==
The Borough of Reading is responsible for all local government. Whitley is currently covered by parts of the Church, Katesgrove and Redlands wards, within the Reading East parliamentary constituency, and includes all of the Whitley electoral ward, within the Reading West parliamentary constituency. Whitley ward borders Coley, Katesgrove, Church and Southcote wards, together with parts of the local government district of Wokingham. As with all wards, apart from smaller Mapledurham, it elects three councillors to Reading Borough Council. Elections since 2004 are held by thirds, with elections in three years out of four. In the 2016, 2018 and 2019 a Labour Party candidate won each election.

==Notable people==
* Ricky Gervais, comedian, actor, film director and producer, musician and writer.
* Midge Ure, musician, whilst a member of Slik in 1974 lived briefly on Hexham Road.
* M. L. Emmett, poet, editor, and convenor of Friendly Street Poets Inc.
* Liam Bridcutt, footballer.

<text>The Parque da Cascata (meaning Waterfall Park in Portuguese) is the popular name of Parque Florestal Municipal de Sete Lagoas located at Serra Santa Helena, just 3 km (2 mi) from downtown Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. It was created by decree on 27 September 1977.

== Caves and geology ==
The gorge of the waterfall in the Parque da Cascata is in fact the collapsed part of a karst cave. Although the Parque da Cascata is easy to reach by car, the actual gorge is hard to reach. The gorge starts with a waterfall and the best way to enter the gorge is following an erosion gully (because the vegetation is inhabited by dangerous snakes, spiders, scorpions etc.!).

Following the brook one sees a number of horizontal stalactites and stalagmites that clearly demonstrates that part of the cave has collapsed. Further down, the brook enters another system of caves with more stalactites and stalagmites. Unfortunately, vandalists have destroyed a number of them. The place where the brook wells out of the Serra Santa Helena is a place for practices of the Macumba religion.

The limestone area north of Belo Horizonte is called the Sete Lagoas Formation. It is in this limestone that the Lagoa Santa Karst was developed. The area around Sete Lagoas has many caves, of which the Gruta Rei do Mato is the most famous one.

<text>Avrig (; , Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Freck/Fraek&quot;, ) is a town in Sibiu County, Transylvania, central Romania. The first documents attesting its existence date to 1346. It officially became a town in 1989, as a result of the Romanian rural systematization program.

== Demographics ==
At the 2011 census, Avrig had 12,815 inhabitants, of whom 95.6% were Romanians, 2.1% Hungarians, 1.5% Roma, and 0.5% Germans (Transylvanian Saxons). At the 2021 census, the town had a population of 12,534; of those, 86.45% were Romanians.

== Administration and local politics ==

=== Town council ===

The town&#x27;s current local council has the following multi-party political composition, based on the results of the votes cast at the 2024 Romanian local elections:

== Geography ==

The town administers four villages: Bradu (&quot;Gierelsau&quot;; &quot;Fenyőfalva&quot;), Glâmboaca (&quot;Hühnerbach&quot;; &quot;Glimboka&quot;), Mârșa and Săcădate (&quot;Sekadaten&quot;; &quot;Oltszakadát&quot;). It is situated in the historical region of Transylvania.

It lies on the left bank of the river Olt (at the mouth of the Avrig River), close to the Făgăraș Mountains, at about from Sibiu on the road towards Brașov. It is the main starting point for the trekking routes in the western part of the mountains, and also on access point at a great number of chalets in the mountains: &quot;Cabana Poiana Neamțului&quot;, &quot;Cabana Bârcaciu&quot;, &quot;Cabana Ghiocelul&quot;.

== Economy ==

Avrig SA Glass Factory, a company specialized in lime mouthblown glass, started its origins in Avrig in the 17th century.

Mârșa village is the site of the Mecanica Mârșa Works, which manufactures auto-trailers and military vehicles.

== Tourism ==

The most important objective in the town is the Brukenthal Summer Palace built in 1771, a baroque summer residence of baron Samuel von Brukenthal, the governor of Transylvania. Also two old churches can be found there: the evangelical church, built in the 13th century and fortified in the 16th century and the orthodox church, built in the 18th century.

Bradu village features a fortified church first attested in 1315, with the last major modification in 1804.

== Natives ==
* Romulus Cândea (1886 – 1973), ecclesiastical historian

<text>Weston Point Docks, also known as the Port of Weston, is an inland port on the Manchester Ship Canal in the town of Runcorn, Cheshire, England. It is operated by FLX Logistics.

==History==

In 1810, the Weaver Navigation Company completed the Weston Canal between Frodsham and the Weston Point area of Runcorn to avoid the difficult entrance to the mouth of the River Weaver, and a dock was established at Weston Point. The Old Basin is still extant but no longer accessible to shipping. The New Basin, built between 1850 and 1856, was filled in between 1963 and 1966.

In 1841, an Anglican church, Christ Church, was constructed on the site of the docks, now redundant but a listed building.

In 1859, a short section of canal called the Runcorn and Weston Canal was built which would link Weston Point Docks on the Weston Canal with Runcorn Docks on the Bridgewater Canal.

Two further docks, the Delamere (1865-1870) and the Tollemache (1885), were built and now form one dock, the Delamache.

The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894. This canal now services the docks as opposed to the Weston Canal and the Weaver Navigation.

==Present==
In August 2007, the owners of the Port of Weston, The Westbury Property Fund, merged with the Eddie Stobart Group to form the Stobart Group. The group planned to develop the site into an inter-modal port facility to enable freight, currently carried by road, to be transported by rail and water. This would mean increased warehousing, new container handling facilities, an extension to the existing West Coast Main Line rail siding, a new link road, and improved navigable access between the dock and the Manchester Ship Canal. The plans were not implemented, however, and the docks are now operated by FLX Logistics.

<doc id="1231042" wikidata="Q1072839" url="?curid=1231042" title="Doc Martin">
<text>Doc Martin is a British medical comedy-drama television series starring Martin Clunes as Doctor Martin Ellingham. It was created by Dominic Minghella developing the character of Dr Martin Bamford from the Nigel Cole comedy film &quot;Saving Grace&quot; (2000). The programme is set in the fictional seaside village of Portwenn and filmed on location in the village of Port Isaac, Cornwall, United Kingdom, with most interior scenes shot in a converted local barn. Fern Cottage is used as the home and surgery of Doctor Ellingham.

Ten series aired between 2004 and 2022, with a television film airing on Christmas Day in 2006. The ninth series premiered on ITV in September 2019. The tenth (and final) series was broadcast from 7 September 2022 to 26 October 2022; the last instalment was a Christmas special that aired on 25 December 2022. On 29 December 2022 a documentary entitled “Farewell Doc Martin” was shown on ITV, featuring behind-the-scenes interviews with the cast and crew as they filmed the final series. It also looked back at highlights from the 18 years of the show.

==Plot==

Dr Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes), a brilliant and successful vascular surgeon at Imperial College London, develops haemophobia – a fear of blood – forcing him to stop practising surgery. He obtains a post as the sole general practitioner (GP) in the sleepy Cornish village of Portwenn, where he had spent childhood holidays with his Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole) and Uncle Phil, who owns a local farm. Upon arriving in Portwenn – where, to his frustration, the locals address him as &quot;Doc Martin&quot; – he finds the surgery in chaos and inherits an incompetent receptionist, Elaine Denham (Lucy Punch). In series 2–4, she is replaced by Pauline Lamb (Katherine Parkinson), a new receptionist, and later also a phlebotomist. In Series 5, Morwenna Newcross (Jessica Ransom) takes up the post.

The programme revolves around Ellingham&#x27;s interactions with the local Cornish villagers. Despite his medical excellence, Ellingham is grouchy and abrupt, and lacks social skills. His direct, emotionless manner offends many villagers, made worse by his invariably unpleasant responses to their ignorant, often foolish, comments. They perceive him to be hot-tempered and lacking in a bedside manner. In contrast, he feels he is performing his duties professionally and by-the-book, not wasting time chatting. Ellingham is very deadpan and dresses formally in a business suit and tie, regardless of the weather or the occasion, and he never takes off his jacket, even when delivering babies. He has no hesitation in pointing out the risks of unhealthy behaviours (e.g. smoking), both in private and in public gatherings.

The villagers eventually discover his fear of blood and the frequent and debilitating bouts of nausea and vomiting it causes. Despite this handicap, Ellingham proves to be an expert diagnostician and responds effectively to various emergencies in his medical practice; thus, he gradually gains grudging respect from his neighbours.

Ellingham does not get on with his parents but has a warm relationship with his Aunt Joan, who provides emotional support. When she dies after a heart attack, her sister Ruth (Eileen Atkins), a retired psychiatrist, comes to Portwenn to take care of her affairs and eventually decides to use the village as a permanent retreat, offering Martin the support Joan had provided.

A major theme throughout the series is Ellingham&#x27;s relationship with a primary school teacher (eventually school headmistress) Louisa Glasson (Caroline Catz). Due to his difficulty in expressing feelings and his insensitive nature, the relationship has many ups and downs, though they eventually have a baby and later marry.

Other series regulars are father and son duo Bert and Al Large, who are always trying to run a small business of some type; pharmacist Sally Tishell who is infatuated with Martin; and Mark Mylow, a quirky police officer who is replaced in Series 3 by the bumbling and inept Joe Penhale.

Regular cast members have characterised Ellingham&#x27;s personality thus:
::Joe Absolom: &quot;The Doctor is ... slightly autistic, probably, on the spectrum.&quot;
::Martin Clunes: &quot;Lots of people say that he is Aspergic or something to some degree—which, yes, I think he is.&quot; He has also said, &quot;He&#x27;s wired the way he&#x27;s wired, but growing up being loathed by both your parents is going to leave a footprint. That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s so dysfunctional with relationships, &#x27;cause there&#x27;s gaps in his makeup. A sad little boy in there comes out a lot, and that&#x27;s what a lot of that frowning is.&quot;
::Eileen Atkins: &quot;He&#x27;s unable to connect with people. He can&#x27;t understand why people can&#x27;t just take the truth, in a rather rough manner. If your parents have been very cold towards you and just factual, then that&#x27;s very hard for you to grow up being—&#x27;loving&#x27; is too strong a word—an affectionate person.&quot;

==Cast and characters==
===Final main cast===
* Martin Clunes as Martin Ellingham – village GP &quot;Doc&quot; Martin has no bedside manner. He despises small talk and is straightforward with patients, delivering his diagnoses and advice without trying to protect their feelings, though he is genuinely concerned about their health. Clunes also plays Martin&#x27;s father in a flashback to Martin&#x27;s childhood in one episode.
* Caroline Catz as Louisa Ellingham (née Glasson) – teacher at Portwenn Primary School, later becomes school headmistress, eventually Dr. Ellingham&#x27;s wife.
* Ian McNeice as Bert Large – plumber and local entrepreneurial businessman who tries and fails at numerous get rich quick schemes.
* Joe Absolom as Al Large – Bert&#x27;s son, who works in a variety of jobs during the series.
* Selina Cadell as Sally Tishell – a pharmacist, who overtly displays unrequited romantic feelings for Ellingham.
* John Marquez as Joe Penhale (series 3–10) – police officer Penhale greatly admires Ellingham, and believes they have a great working relationship, an optimistic assessment not shared by the doctor. Penhale has proudly referred to Ellingham and himself as &quot;The Dynamic Duo&quot;. Ellingham focuses on Penhale&#x27;s bumbling manner, but Penhale often shows surprising insight into the town&#x27;s interpersonal dynamics.
* Eileen Atkins as Ruth Ellingham (series 5–10) – retired forensic psychiatrist, who is also one of Martin&#x27;s aunts.
* Jessica Ransom as Morwenna Large (née Newcross) (Series 5–10) – surgery receptionist.

===Previous main cast===
* Stephanie Cole as Joan Norton – Martin&#x27;s aunt (series 1–4)
* Stewart Wright as Mark Mylow – police constable, later promoted to sergeant (series 1–2, one episode in series 9)
* Lucy Punch as Elaine Denham – the original surgery receptionist (series 1)
* Katherine Parkinson as Pauline Lamb – surgery receptionist (series 2–4)

===Other previous cast===
=== Original character ===
Martin Clunes originally played a character called Dr. Martin Bamford in the comedy film &quot;Saving Grace&quot; (2000)—written by Mark Crowdy and Craig Ferguson—and its two made-for-TV prequels, &quot;Doc Martin&quot; and &quot;Doc Martin and the Legend of the Cloutie&quot;, which were made by British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). The prequels show Bamford as a successful obstetrician, rather than a surgeon, who finds out that his wife has been carrying on extramarital affairs behind his back. After confronting her with his discovery, he escapes London and heads for Port Isaac, a small coastal town in Cornwall that he remembers fondly from his youth. Shortly after he arrives, he is involved in the mystery of the &quot;Jellymaker&quot; and, following the departure of the village&#x27;s resident GP, decides to stay and fill the vacancy. In these three films the village is not known as Portwenn.

The Martin Bamford character is friendly and laid-back, seeming to enjoy his retreat from the career pressures and conflicts he left behind in London. He drinks and smokes carelessly, including a mild illegal drug, and has no problem getting his hands and clothes dirty by temporarily working as a lobster and crab fisherman aboard a local boat.

The original deal had been to produce two television films per year for three years, but Sky Pictures folded after the first two episodes were made, so Clunes&#x27;s company tried to sell the franchise to ITV. The new network felt that the doctor character should be portrayed as a &quot;townie&quot;, a fish out of water who is uncomfortable in the countryside. They also wanted something darker, so Clunes suggested that the doctor be curmudgeonly, socially inept, and formal. The new doctor&#x27;s surname was changed to Ellingham, an anagram of the last name of the new writer, Dominic Minghella, who was brought in to rework the doctor&#x27;s background and create a new cast of supporting characters.

Apart from Clunes, the only actors to appear in both versions of &quot;Doc Martin&quot; are Tristan Sturrock and Tony Maudsley.

==Episodes==

Ten series, totalling 79 episodes, aired on ITV in the UK between 2004 and 2022. Episodes are just under 50 minutes long, except for the 2006 TV film which is 92 minutes, and the 2022 Christmas special. In the US, American Public Television provided the 2006 TV film as a two-part episode, with the second episode airing a week after the first.
In April 2020 director Nigel Cole confirmed plans for a tenth and final series, which aired in Autumn 2022.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
In the UK, &quot;Doc Martin&quot; was a ratings success for ITV, with the third series achieving ITV&#x27;s best midweek drama performance in the 9pm Monday slot since December 2004. The final episode of the third series was watched by 10.37 million viewers, which is the programme&#x27;s highest-ever viewing figure for a single episode.

In 2009, &quot;Doc Martin&quot; was moved to a 9pm Sunday time slot for the broadcast of Series 4. That change meant that it followed ITV&#x27;s &quot;The X Factor&quot; programme. Series 4 ratings were adversely affected by STV not screening the majority of ITV drama productions in Scotland. The final episode of Series 4 had ratings of 10.29 million viewers. STV went back on its decision not to screen ITV dramas in Scotland. Series 4 of &quot;Doc Martin&quot; was broadcast on Sunday afternoons in August 2011.

===Accolades===
In 2004, &quot;Doc Martin&quot; won the British Comedy Award for &quot;Best TV Comedy Drama&quot;, having also been nominated for &quot;Best New TV Comedy&quot;. In the same year, Martin Clunes won the &quot;Best TV Comedy Actor&quot; award, primarily for his portrayal of Doc Martin.

== Adaptations ==
=== Czech Republic and Slovakia ===
In 2014, Czech Television and Radio and Television of Slovakia began filming their own TV series starring Miroslav Donutil, which is heavily inspired by the original British series. The series started to air on 30 August 2015 in Slovakia and from 4 September 2015 in Czechia. The Czech version is set in the Beskydy mountains, which is a picturesque area in the east of the Czech Republic on the border with Slovakia; like Portwenn, it is a long way from the capital, Prague, and dependent on the tourist industry.

=== France ===
In cooperation with TF1, French television company Ego Productions has produced a French version of the series starring Thierry Lhermitte as Dr Martin Le Foll, with the series based in the fictional Breton town of Port-Garrec and filmed in Finistère. The series was broadcast on TF1 from 10 January 2011 to 27 April 2015.

===Germany===
In Germany, &quot;Doktor Martin&quot;, an adaptation of the original series, airs on ZDF with Axel Milberg as Doktor Martin Helling, a surgeon from Berlin.

===Greece===
In Greece, &quot;Kliniki Periptosi&quot;, an adaptation of the original series filmed in the Ionian Seaside town of Kardamyli, was aired in November 2011 on Mega Channel with Yannis Bezos as Markos Staikos, a surgeon from New York.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, &quot;Dokter Tinus&quot; based on the original series began airing in late August 2012 on SBS6, with the main role being played by actor Thom Hoffman. The series was shot in Woudrichem on the Waal riverside.

=== Spain ===
Notro Films produced a Spanish version under the title &quot;Doctor Mateo&quot; for Antena 3 Televisión. The lead role of Dr. Mateo Sancristobal was played by Gonzalo de Castro. It aired in 2009 and was shot in Lastres, Asturias, called the fictional village of San Martín del Sella.

Region 4 (Australia) Releases:
==Airings beyond the UK==

This series is popular around the world, both as itself and as a model for shows made in other nations.

As of 2018, &quot;Doc Martin&quot; was aired in New Zealand on TVNZ 1, in Iceland on RUV, in Italy on the Hallmark Channel from September 2007 (seasons 1-3), Rai 3 from May 2010 and various reruns. The series was streaming on RaiPlay, in Australia on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) network and Foxtel pay-television subscription network via its UK-TV channel. The show aired and streamed on various public broadcasting stations around the US and Canada; this was arranged through the distributor American Public Television. As of 2021, it was streaming on Netflix, Pluto TV, Tubi and Amazon Prime Video.

==Novelisations==
Two novels by Sam Hawksmoor, using the byline &quot;Sam North&quot;, were published by Ebury in 2013. The first, &quot;Practice Makes Perfect&quot;, adapts the teleplays of series one; the second, &quot;Mistletoe and Whine&quot;, adapts the teleplays of series two. The author employs some timeline shifting, linked to character internalisation and point of view, so the narratives are not always as linear as in the teleplays.

<doc id="1231046" wikidata="Q339892" url="?curid=1231046" title="Mason Williams">
<text>Mason Douglas Williams (born August 24, 1938) is an American classical guitarist, composer, singer, writer, comedian, and poet, best known for his 1968 instrumental &quot;Classical Gas&quot; and for his work as a comedy writer on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot;, and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

== Early life ==
Williams was born in Abilene, Texas, the son of Jackson Eugene (a tile setter) and Kathlyn (née Nations) Williams.

Williams grew up dividing his time between living with his father in Oklahoma and his mother in Oakridge, Oregon. He graduated from Northwest Classen High School in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1956. In Oklahoma, he began his lifelong friendship with artist Edward Ruscha.

He attended Oklahoma City University (1957–60) and North Texas State University for one semester, and served in the United States Navy from 1961 to 1963.

== Career ==
=== Music ===
In 1968, Williams won three Grammy Awards for his guitar instrumental &quot;Classical Gas&quot;. &quot;Classical Gas&quot; was released as a single from &quot;The Mason Williams Phonograph Record&quot; in 1968. &quot;Classical Gas&quot; won three Grammys that year for &quot;Best Instrumental (theme) Composition&quot;, &quot;Best Instrumental (theme) Performance&quot;, and &quot;Best Instrumental Orchestra Arrangement&quot;, Mike Post, arranger. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. He also wrote songs for The Kingston Trio. For both &quot;Handmade&quot; and &quot;Sharepickers&quot;, Mason received two more Grammy nominations for &quot;Best Album Cover Design&quot;. Together with Nancy Ames, he wrote &quot;Cinderella Rockefella&quot;, a 1968 number-one hit for Esther and Abi Ofarim in the United Kingdom.

In 1970, Williams made a television appearance on a variety show, &quot;Just Friends&quot;, which reunited regulars of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;. To create a visual element for his performance, he used a special playable classical plexiglass guitar built for him by Billy Cheatwood and a prop designer for ABC. For the performance, Williams filled the guitar with water and added a couple of goldfish. He then used the plexiglass guitar to finger-sync his hit version of &quot;Classical Gas&quot;.

Williams has recorded more than a dozen albums, five on the Warner Bros. label (&quot;The Mason Williams Phonograph Record&quot;, &quot;The Mason Williams Ear Show&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Handmade&quot;, and &quot;Sharepickers&quot;). The LP cover for the 1968 &quot;Music&quot; was painted by pop artist Edward Ruscha. The credit reads &quot;Sorry, Cover by Edward Ruscha.&quot;

In December 1970, Williams performed benefit concerts for the Pala Indian Reservation Cultural Center hosted by Clairemont High School. Sponsored by the nonprofit Americans for Indian Future and Tradition, with the help of Ken Kragen and Friends, Williams performed two shows. The event raised enough funds to pay for the construction of the block walls.

In 1987, he teamed with Mannheim Steamroller to release a new album on the American Gramaphone label. The album, titled &quot;Classical Gas&quot;, included a remake of the 1968 composition. Another track from the album, &quot;Country Idyll&quot;, was a 1988 nominee for a Grammy in the country music category for &quot;Best Instrumental Performance by a Soloist, Group or Orchestra&quot;. The album went gold in 1991. Williams&#x27; plexiglass guitar appears on the cover of the album. He released an acoustic instrumental album of Christmas and holiday music, &quot;A Gift of Song&quot;, on the Real Music label, featuring arrangements of traditional carols and original compositions.

In 1992, the Vanguard label released &quot;Music 1968–1971&quot;, a compilation of tracks from his five Warner Bros. albums recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Williams relates that when compiling the album, he went to Warner Bros. and asked, &quot;Where&#x27;s that painting that Ed Ruscha did for that old [&quot;Music&quot;] cover?&quot; and was told it had been thrown away; a probable loss of $3–5 million.

In conjunction with the release of this album, Williams added a &quot;Holiday Concert Program&quot; to his repertoire, featuring music from the album and other traditional music of the season. In 1994, he played six sold-out concerts with the Oregon Symphony in Portland, Oregon. In the 1990s, he also performed with the Eugene Symphony with friend Ken Kesey.

Williams then concentrated on a variety of programs for his concert appearances. His &quot;Concert For Bluegrass Band And Orchestra&quot;, also titled &quot;Symphonic Bluegrass&quot;, has been performed with over 40 symphony orchestras, including the Colorado Symphony Orchestra, Kansas City Symphony, Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra, Oklahoma City Philharmonic, Louisville Orchestra, and Edmonton Symphony Orchestra.

In 1984, Williams released an album, &quot;Of Time &amp; Rivers Flowing&quot;, on his own Skookum label, containing 14 of the roughly 35 songs performed in the concert. In 1993, the title cut from the album was used as the soundtrack for a 90-second public service announcement (PSA) created by the American Rivers Council on the home video release of &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;. The PSA was also on the 1995 home video release of &quot;The River Wild&quot;. That same year, Williams was invited to play for Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber&#x27;s inauguration, and in 1996, Williams received an honorary doctorate in music from his alma mater, Oklahoma City University.

In 1998, BMI, the performance-rights organization that tracks air-play performances on radio and television, presented Williams with a Special Citation of Achievement in recognition of the great national and international popularity of &quot;Classical Gas&quot;. By 2008, the song logged over six million broadcast performances, to become the all-time number-one instrumental composition for air play in BMI&#x27;s repertoire.

In 1999, Williams played again for the Kitzhaber&#x27;s second inauguration. In February, Williams&#x27; &quot;Bus&quot; art piece was included in the Norton Simon Museum exhibition &quot;Radical Past&quot;, in Pasadena, California. In the spring, he played his &quot;Of Time and Rivers Flowing&quot; concert with the Oregon Children&#x27;s Choral Festival, a two-day event involving 3,000 elementary school children singing water and rivers songs with Williams and his band. Williams received the Distinguished Service Award from the University of Oregon in honor of his contribution to the arts in Oregon. In late 1999, the Bluegrass Band and he played for Byron Berline&#x27;s Oklahoma International Bluegrass Festival in Guthrie, Oklahoma, with the Oklahoma City Philharmonic.

Williams&#x27; music has been featured in several movies, including &quot;The Story of Us&quot;, &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, &quot;The Dish&quot;, &quot;The Heidi Chronicles&quot;, and &quot;Heartbreakers&quot;. His compositions also have been played on the television series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

In 2003, Williams released an EP, &quot;Music for the Epicurean Harkener&quot;, and again was nominated for a Grammy in 2004 for best instrumental album. In 2005, he collaborated with UK guitarist Zoe McCulloch on the album &quot;Electrical Gas&quot;.

In June 2006, Williams performed at his 50th high-school reunion at Northwest Classen High School in Oklahoma City. He performed with other musicians as Mason Williams and Friends at concerts in Eugene and Springfield (Oregon) and at the opening gala at the Richard E. Wildish Community Theater in Springfield.

In January 2007, he was reunited with long-time friend and artist Edward Ruscha, performing at the Getty Center in Los Angeles.

In October 2007, he was inducted into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame. and co-headlined a concert with Everclear and Paul Revere and the Raiders.

In 2022, BGO Records announced the release of a two-CD collection of five of his early albums.

=== Comedy ===
Like many writer-performers, Williams was also a stand-up comedian. He set most of his comic ideas to music and sang or recited the jokes in lyric form with guitar accompaniment. In 1964, Vee-Jay Records released &quot;Them Poems&quot;, a record album on which Williams entertains a live audience with &quot;them poems about them people&quot;, covering such varied topics as &quot;Them Moose Goosers&quot;, &quot;Them Sand Pickers&quot;, and &quot;Them Surf Serfs&quot;. A typical &quot;them poem&quot; is &quot;Them Banjo Pickers&quot;, which begins: &quot;Them banjo pickers! Mighty funny ways. Same damn song three or four days!&quot; Several other &quot;them&quot; poems, along with many ditties, song lyrics, odd and amusing photographs from around the country, and assorted bits of visual and verbal silliness are collected in &quot;The Mason Williams Reading Matter&quot; (Doubleday, 1969), and the &quot;Them Poems&quot; record album was reissued (also in 1969, on the heels of the success of &quot;Classical Gas&quot;) as &quot;The Mason Williams Listening Matter&quot;.

Williams has written more than 175 hours of music and comedy for network television programming and was a prime creative force for CBS&#x27; controversial &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;. His experience in folk music gave him the background for many of Tom and Dick Smothers&#x27; comedy routines and with co-writer Nancy Ames, also composed the show&#x27;s musical theme.

On the &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, he created and perpetuated the 1968 &quot;Pat Paulsen for President&quot; campaign, an elaborate political satire. Williams also helped launch the career of entertainer Steve Martin. Martin was hired by Williams as a writer on the &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, for which his contributions were initially paid out of Williams&#x27; own pocket. In 1968, he won an Emmy Award for his work as a comedy writer on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;.

Other television personalities for whom he has written include Andy Williams, Glen Campbell, Dinah Shore, Roger Miller, and Petula Clark. In 1980, Williams briefly served as head writer for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, but left after clashing with producer Jean Doumanian. In 1988, Williams received his third Emmy nomination as a comedy writer for his work on &quot;The Smothers Brothers 20th Reunion Special&quot; on CBS.

In February 2000, Williams participated in the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado. The sixth annual festival honored &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; and its contribution to television. Williams performed a concert with Tom and Dick Smothers, and again on a late-night show with performers that included Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Martin Short, Andrea Martin, Steve Martin, Robin Williams, and Marc Shaiman.

===Other artistic work===
Also a photographer, Williams published a life-sized photo print of a Greyhound bus in the 1960s. 
He appeared with the print on the cover of his first album, &quot;The Mason Williams Phonograph Record&quot;.

Williams also created a book titled &quot;The Mason Williams Reading Matter&quot;, which was published by Doubleday &amp; Company with copyrights ranging from 1964 to 1969. In this opus, he included original poetry, many with comical lyrics, and original photographs, some of which are funny.

In 1967, Williams attempted a filming of drawing the world&#x27;s biggest sunflower. As Williams remarked, &quot;the film was to be a slow-motion aerial ballet in which an old bi-wing aeroplane skywrites “draws” the stem and leaves of a flower in the sky beneath the sun, the sun itself thereby becoming the blossom of a “Sun“ flower.&quot; Due to technical difficulties dealing with filming photographing directly into the sun, the film did not turn out. Nevertheless, the completed flower measured 2 miles wide by 3 miles high, and lasted 40 seconds.

== Environmentalism ==
After becoming involved in protests against a Willamette River hydroelectric power project, Williams eventually collected over 400 songs about rivers.

He created a program called &quot;Of Time and Rivers Flowing&quot;. that encompasses classical, folk, minstrel, gospel, jazz, country, pop, and contemporary rock music genres.

== Personal life ==
Williams married Sheila Ann Massey on April 22, 1961; they had one daughter, Kathryn Michelle, before divorcing.

He remarried, to Katherine Elizabeth Kahn, in February 1994; the couple divorced after 10 years.

He lives in Eugene, Oregon, with his Canadian-born wife, Karen, an attorney.

<text>Bodhimaṇḍa (Sanskrit and Pali) or daochang (; J. dōjō; T. byang chub snying po) is a term used in Buddhism meaning the &quot;seat of awakening&quot; or &quot;platform of enlightenment&quot;. According to Haribhadra, it is &quot;a place used as a seat, where the essence of enlightenment is present&quot;. In our world, this refers to the specific spot in Bodh Gaya under the bodhi tree, where Shakyamuni Buddha attained enlightenment, but technically, it can be used to refer to the place of awakening of any Buddha or bodhisattva. 

In Buddhist cosmology, the bodhimaṇḍa is also said to be the center or navel of the world, i.e. an axis mundi which connects the divine and profane worlds. 

Bodhimaṇḍas are regularly visited by Buddhist pilgrims, and some have gone on to become popular secular tourist destinations as well. In many forms of Buddhism, it is believed that bodhimaṇḍas are spiritually pure places, or otherwise conducive to meditation and enlightenment.

==Famous bodhimaṇḍas in India==
* The Vajrasana, Bodh Gaya: Gautama Buddha
* Mount Potalaka: Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva

==Famous bodhimaṇḍas in China==
* Mount Putuo: Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva
* Mount Emei: Samantabhadra Bodhisattva
* Mount Wutai: Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva
* Mount Jiuhua: Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva

==See also==
*Dojo and dojang, two types of buildings whose names are written with the same Chinese characters used for &quot;daochang&quot;

<doc id="1231078" wikidata="Q209659" url="?curid=1231078" title="Canon FD lens mount">
<text>The Canon FD lens mount is a physical standard for connecting a photographic lens to a 35mm single-lens reflex camera body. The standard was developed by Canon of Japan and was introduced in March 1971 with the Canon F-1 camera. It served as the Canon SLR interchangeable lens mounting system until the 1987 introduction of the Canon EOS series cameras, which use the newer EF lens mount. The FD mount lingered through the release of the 1990 Canon T60, the last camera introduced in the FD system, and the end of the Canon New F-1 product cycle in 1992.

==Overview==

The FD mount is mechanically compatible with and replaced Canon&#x27;s earlier FL mount,which in turn had replaced the R mount; FD-mount cameras can use FL lenses in stop-down metering mode and R lenses will mount, but must be used with manual aperture and stop-down metering.

Though never officially explained by Canon, others have attempted to assign a meaning to the &quot;FD&quot; designation. One such attempt states that the &quot;FD&quot; notation stands for &quot;Focal-plane shutter with Dual linkage for diaphragm control&quot;; in actuality, there were two linkages and two signals: the automatic aperture lever, aperture signal lever, full aperture signal pin, and automatic exposure lock pin. This is twice the previous lens series, which used the &quot;FL&quot; designation, said to mean &quot;Focal-plane shutter, Linked mount.&quot;

Over the 21-plus years of production, Canon introduced 134 different FD lenses ranging from 7.5mm through 1,200mm in seventeen different fixed focal lengths and nineteen different zoom ranges, one of the most, if not the most, extensive manual focus lens lines ever produced.

The Canon FD system enjoyed huge popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, when it established and grew a market share with professional photographers as well as having equipped over a million consumer users. Indeed, sales of the Canon AE-1 camera alone exceeded one million.

Canon obsoleted the FD mount by its decision to create the all-electronic EF mount. Thus, the FD mount system, with limited provision for auto-focus, is now commercially obsolete, and Canon FD cameras and lenses are available for low prices on the second-hand market. This makes the system very attractive to 35mm film photographers who demand the highest optical quality, while not needing auto focus capability.

FD lenses can be used on many mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras with a suitable adapter. They are a popular alternative to modern lenses among some users, though they lack autofocus.

===Description===

The FD lens mount is a breech-lock mount, which is a variation of the common triple-flanged bayonet attachment. The advantage of the breech-lock over the bayonet is that neither the contact surfaces between the body and lens, nor the signalling mechanisms, rotate against each other when the lens is mounted. This prevents any mechanical wear, which could conceivably reduce the very precise lens-to-film distance or introduce communication errors between lens and body.

The key pins and levers on the lens mount which transmit information mechanically between the lens and body include:
* Automatic/Manual Aperture Lever – stops down aperture to the position selected on the aperture ring when the shutter is released; this can be moved all the way anti-clockwise (viewing the rear of the lens) to force the lens to operate in manual aperture mode only, such as when the lens is mounted on an early camera body with the R mount
* Aperture Signal Lever – transmits the aperture selected on the lens to the in-body meter, which enables full-aperture viewing while providing accurate metering information
* Full Aperture Signal Pin – transmits the maximum aperture of the lens mounted on the body
* EE Switch Pin – signals the body when the lens is set for shutter-preferred autoexposure by moving the aperture ring to &quot;A&quot; or &quot;o&quot;

To mount the lens, the Positioning Pin is placed in the corresponding notch on the top bayonet lug (12 o&#x27;clock position) and the breech-lock ring (for first-generation FD lenses) or lens body (for New FD lenses) is rotated clockwise (facing the front of the lens) to lock the lens onto the body.

===Versions===
Canon&#x27;s first generation of the FD breech-lock used the same rotating mounting ring at the rear of the lens as the earlier R- and FL-series lenses; the lens body itself did not rotate for mounting. There is a small pin which prevents movement of the breech-lock ring when the lens is not mounted on the camera. Its minor disadvantage was a somewhat slower lens change than a bayonet.

There are three different versions of breech ring FD lenses:

# The first version had a chrome plated front barrel (nicknamed &quot;chrome nose&quot;) and a green &quot;o&quot; for auto exposure. 
# The second version had a black front barrel and still had a green &quot;o&quot; for auto exposure. 
# The third version had a black front barrel, and a green &quot;A&quot; for auto exposure. These different versions are detailed below under variants.

Second-generation FD lenses, first marketed in 1979 as &quot;New FD&quot;, are mounted like bayonet-mount lenses in that the photographer twists the entire lens body to mount and dismount, though the actual mating surfaces still remain fixed. This retained the advantages of the breech-lock mount while enabling the convenience of a bayonet. The letters SC or SSC, to indicate the lens coating, were no longer put on the lenses. Canon documents stated that all new FD lenses except for the new FD 50mm F1.8 had SSC coatings. Canon later chose a bayonet-style mount for its EOS system&#x27;s EF lenses, where there is no precision mechanical coupling.

===Functions===

Like its FL predecessor, the FD mount system allowed automatic diaphragm function, but in addition, a new signal pin supported full-aperture metering. A second signal pin for the &quot;auto&quot; setting of the aperture dial, plus a linkage to allow the camera to set the degree of diaphragm opening, enabled integral auto-exposure. The first camera to use this was the 1971 Canon F-1, when equipped with the Servo EE Finder. Later, the Canon EF of 1973 had automatic exposure built-in, as did the very popular Canon A-series cameras (save the AT-1) beginning in 1976.

Thus, starting with the first FD lenses produced in late 1970, all FD lenses had the capability of supporting full-aperture metering and multiple Automatic Exposure (AE) modes using both shutter-preferred and aperture-preferred modes. Even Programmed AE was possible with no modifications to the lens mount, though at the time of its introduction Canon did not have an AE camera body in the FD line. This was a design triumph for Canon that no other camera or lens maker was able to equal in 1970. Every other camera manufacturer had to make one or more alterations to its lens mount to enable full aperture metering, and later AE and or Programmed AE operation.

The FD mount has no support for either electrical or mechanical lens-body communication required for autofocus, which was a primary reason for its retirement. (The three AC series lenses, extended from the FD lens mount, described below, are an exception). While Canon could have adapted its mount to support auto-focus, as did other manufacturers, the company instead chose to make a clean break with the past and design a completely new interface with support for electrical signaling and control.

==FD lens variants==
===Coatings and cosmetic changes===

The earliest breech-lock Canon FD lenses (1970-1973) are generally recognizable by a chrome (silver) filter ring at the front (this ring includes its own bayonet used to mount an appropriate lens hood). Nicknamed &#x27;chrome nose&#x27; lenses, these used two new proprietary lens coatings, designated &quot;S.C.&quot; (Spectra Coating) and &quot;S.S.C.&quot; (Super Spectra Coating), but neither coating was signified on the front of the lens. These were both multi-coatings, but indicated two quality grades. In the &#x27;chrome nose&#x27; series, only the large-aperture 55mm f/1.2, and 55mm F1.2 AL (Aspherical) and the 7.5mm Fish-Eye lenses used S.S.C. coating. This first series of FD lenses shared other characteristics that would later change; the breech-lock ring can be rotated freely without mounting it on a camera body, and the aperture ring had a green &quot;o&quot; at the end of the scale to indicate automatic aperture operation, which at the time was only possible with an F-1 body that had the Servo EE Finder attached. The aperture ring could be rotated freely on and off of &quot;o&quot;, although the small AE switch pin in the back of the lens (which came out when the aperture ring was rotated to &quot;o&quot;) prevented one from doing this unless the body has the appropriate small hole in the proper location. There are chrome nose first generation FD lenses without chrome front barrels: several wide angle lenses and some telephoto lenses have black barrels, but their date code, lack of an aperture lock button and freely rotating breech ring place them into the first version FD lens group.

The second series of breech-lock FD lenses (1973-1976), which discontinued the chrome barrel front, is engraved &quot;S.C.&quot; in white or &quot;S.S.C.&quot; in red on the front of the lens. The S.S.C. coating was extended to most lenses in this series. The basic S.C. coating was, for the most part, limited to the least expensive lenses. These 2nd breech ring generation FD lenses still had a green &quot;o&quot;, but now there was a chrome lock button on the aperture ring that had to be depressed to put the lens on or take the lens off of &quot;o&quot;. One still could not put the lens on &quot;o&quot; unless the camera body had the AE switch pin hole. And the lens could not be mounted on a non-EE / AE body if the lens was set on &quot;o&quot;. The breech ring now featured a lock which prevented it from rotating unless a rear cap was put on or the lens was mounted to a body. Further, the breech ring rotated slightly when the lens was mounted to aid in getting the lens securely mounted. The aperture diaphragm was opened fully when the breech ring was in the locked position.

The third variant, made from 1976 to the end of production of breech ring FD lenses (around 1980) changed the green &quot;o&quot; to a green &quot;A&quot; and the chrome aperture ring lock button was changed from chrome to black. The breech ring was still locked unless mounted and it still had the spring loaded twist to make it easier to mount the lens. The third version FD 50mm F1.8 lens also received a plastic front barrel to reduce size and weight. This corresponded with the introduction of the Canon A-series cameras which were smaller and lighter than the older, larger and heavier &quot;F-series&quot; bodies.

In 1978, with the introduction of the &quot;New FD&quot; series (nicknamed &#x27;FDn&#x27;), the coating type was no longer specified on the lens front. All of these lenses received S.S.C. coating, with the sole exception of the 50mm lens. &quot;New FD&quot; lenses are easily identifiable by the replacement of the breech ring with a square metal release button at the base of the lens. When installing the lens, the entire body rotates except for the mating surfaces. This design allowed for the benefits of the precision breech lock and the ease of a bayonet mount. 

The original breech-lock FD lenses and the &quot;New FD&quot; lenses are completely functionally interchangeable, and may each be used on any FD camera body. A minor operational difference between New FD and earlier lenses occurs only when using a Canon New F-1 body with the AE Finder FN in aperture preferred AE mode. The New FD lenses&#x27; aperture rings were placed closer to the rear of the lens so that the aperture value is visible in the new F-1&#x27;s viewfinder, via an optical prism. Earlier lenses&#x27; aperture scales do not align properly with the prism, and are therefore not visible.

===Aspherical, Fluorite or &#x27;L&#x27; lenses===

An enhanced range of FD lenses was available to photographers who required the highest optical and mechanical performance. In addition to more robust mechanical construction, these lenses used a variety of special technologies, including ground aspherical surfaces, fluorite optical elements, and ultra-low-dispersion glass. Canon used these means to achieve outstanding optical performance at the extremes of lens design: wide apertures and extreme focal lengths. Aspherical surfaces improved performance of wide-angle and standard lenses at very wide apertures. Ultra-low dispersion and fluorite elements virtually eliminated chromatic aberration at long focal lengths.

The earlier versions of these lenses carried &quot;AL&quot;, &quot;Aspherical&quot;, or &quot;Fluorite&quot; indications on the front of the lens. The post-1979 &#x27;New FD&#x27; versions acknowledged all the exotic technologies under the single designation &quot;L&quot; (commonly believed to indicate &#x27;luxury&#x27; or &#x27;asphericaL&#x27;). Canon has continued the &quot;L&quot; designation, and the famous red ring around the lens front, in the current EF and RF autofocus lenses for EOS cameras, where the symbol now officially stands for &quot;Luxury.&quot;

===Macro lenses===
The FD series included a number of zoom lenses with close-focusing mechanisms, targeted at amateur photographers. The series also included three true macro lenses at 50mm, 100mm, and 200mm. These offered exceptionally close focusing and were corrected for flatness of field at close shooting distances. The 50mm and 100mm were marketed with extension tubes that allowed life-size reproduction. The 200mm can reach life size without additional extension.

===Special-purpose lenses===
Canon offered seven specialty lenses for the FD mount. The 35mm 2.8 Tilt-Shift lens is a perspective control lens which includes controls to shift the lens off-axis by ±11mm for perspective control. In addition to shift, it may be tilted ±8 degrees for depth of field control; both movements are possible simultaneously. Though it uses the breech-lock mount, it is not literally an FD lens since its diaphragm is operated manually and it must be used with stop-down metering.

The 85mm 2.8 Soft Focus lens is designed for portraiture. The photographer may introduce three levels of spherical aberration by sliding the focusing ring forward or backward. Since aperture also affects the magnitude of the soft focus effect, a wide range of results are possible. The lens may also be used as a standard short telephoto. It offers all FD features.

The Reflex 500mm 8 lens is a supertelephoto catadioptric lens of high optical quality which shares the unique characteristics of all mirror lenses with a central obstruction. Since its aperture is fixed at 8, it lacks FD signals and controls. It must be used in manual or stopped-down metering mode.
Canon also produced two fisheye lenses. The 7.5mm 5.6 is a circular fisheye, rendering a 180 degree field of view in a 23mm image circle. It is technically a FL lens, as it requires manual diapragm operation and stopped-down metering. The 15mm 2.8 is a full-frame fisheye, rendering a 180 degree field of view across the diagonal of the 35mm frame with the considerable barrel distortion of a fisheye lens. It includes all FD features and may be used with automatic exposure. Both lenses include internal filters.

The remaining specialty lenses are the 20mm 3.5 and 35mm 2.8 Macrophoto lenses. Similar to microscope objectives, they provide magnifications of 4X-10X and 2X-6X respectively when mounted on the FD Auto Bellows. They can only be used with a bellows, via an FD adapter; while the adapter can mechanically mount them directly to a camera, they cannot function optically. They are not properly FD lenses, but are listed here because they are part of the whole system.

==FD autofocusing lenses==

Before the FD mount was obsoleted by the EOS system, Canon built four autofocus lenses. Of these, only the FD 35-70mm f/4 AF was capable of autofocus on all FD cameras. The others, known as AC lenses, offered autofocus only on the T80 camera.

The FD 35-70mm f/4 AF contained an entirely independent autofocus system and was among the world&#x27;s first autofocus zoom lenses (the Pentax ME F was the first ). The autofocus system was activated by a button on the side of the lens, and involved no communication with the camera body. It was reasonably accurate with still subjects, but was too slow to be a practical solution for moving subjects such as sports.
Further development produced the AC derivative of the FD mount. Three AC lenses were manufactured, the AC 50mm 1.8, AC 35-70mm 3.5-4.5, and AC 75-200mm 4.5. All were released in April, 1985 alongside the Canon T80 camera, which was the only camera ever manufactured to take advantage of the AC lenses&#x27; AF capabilities. The lenses communicated with the T80 via a modified FD mount with added electrical contacts. They lacked an aperture ring, and were therefore usable only in automatic-exposure modes. They were otherwise identical to the FD mount and could be manually focused on those FD-mount cameras that could control the aperture. The AC line proved to be a dead-end development in light of the EF series development, and Canon would abandon the capability in the three remaining FD-mount cameras it produced, the New F-1, T90, and T60.

==Using FD lenses on other mounts==
The 42mm flange focal distance of the FD mount is shorter than that of most other lens mounts. Therefore, some lenses from other period cameras with longer flange focal distance can be mounted on Canon FD-mount cameras with appropriate adapters and still retain infinity focus. FD lenses can be adapted to other cameras with longer flange focal distances, though the lenses cannot focus to infinity unless the adapter contains an optical correction element which may compromise image quality, as it is not part of the original FD lens optical design.

Following the introduction of the EOS camera line, whose EF lens mount has a 44 mm flange focal distance, Canon briefly marketed an adapter which enabled certain FD telephoto lenses to be used on EOS bodies. The adapter contained high-quality corrective optics and functioned as a 1.26x tele-converter; it could not be used on lenses shorter than 200mm in focal length, nor any lens that interfered with its protruding optics. The adapter was produced in limited numbers, with the intent of easing the initial cost of conversion for professional users who owned expensive FD telephoto lenses. Originally priced at $250, these adapters are now scarce and highly valued, selling for around $1,000 on the second-hand market. Other inexpensive aftermarket FD to EOS adapters are available and can be used at the cost of severely reduced image quality, particularly at large apertures.

Mechanically skilled photographers and technicians have successfully retrofitted FD lenses with alternative mounts, including the Arri PL mount and Canon EF mount.
FD lenses can be mounted on Canon rangefinder cameras or other Leica screw mount cameras using the Canon Lens Mount Adapter B, but rangefinder-coupled focusing is lost.

FD lenses have been regularly used with the Micro Four Thirds system since its introduction in 2008. It has a flange focal distance of only 20mm and a 2× crop factor, halving the field of view compared to the original 24x36mm film frame.

As of 2012, with the introduction of the Canon EOS M mirrorless camera, almost all FD or FL lenses can be successfully adapted with infinity focus available without the need for a compensating lens, thus not compromising resolution, contrast and distortion performance. The EOS-M has an 18 megapixel APS-C sensor, offering image quality and resolution equivalent to other Canon EF-S APS-C sized sensors, retaining their 1.6× crop factor. The FD/FL lens must be manually focused and metering is done with aperture priority.

FD lenses can also be mounted to current mirrorless digital cameras with short flange focal distance, using simple mechanical adapters without optical correction. FD lenses, especially wide and ultra-wide f/2.8, f/2 and f/1.4 variants, have proven popular options for videography for these mirrorless formats.

===FD lenses===

The FD series includes lenses of all standard focal lengths ranging from 7.5mm to 800mm. At least two different maximum apertures were offered at each focal length from 24mm to 500mm.

The original generation of FD lenses featured a silver colored locking ring at the base, similar to the preceding FL and R series lenses. Only the locking ring turns to lock the lens to the camera body; the lens body remains stationary. The later &quot;New FD&quot; lenses have a black mount which includes a chrome lens release button.

Note that some lenses listed below were marketed in only one generation. Lenses of identical focal lengths and maximum apertures that spanned both generations, in addition to their altered mounts, were typically smaller and lighter in the &quot;New FD&quot; generation, and usually used smaller diameter filters.

;Special limited production:
* 800mm 3.8 Mirror
* 2000mm 11 Mirror
* 5200mm 14 Mirror
* In addition, a 1200mm 5.6L lens was developed and used at the 1984 Summer Olympics, but never marketed as an FD lens. All copies of that lens were shipped back to Canon headquarters in Japan, converted to the EF mount, and sold as EF lenses.

;Macrophoto lenses:
* Macrophoto Lens 20mm f/2.8
* Macrophoto Lens 35mm f/2.8

In addition to first-party lenses sold by Canon and listed here, numerous OEM and third-party manufacturers built lenses with Canon FD mount, including Cosina, Kiron, Sigma, Soligor, Tamron, Tokina, and Vivitar.

<text>In budgeting, and management accounting in general, a variance is the difference between a budgeted, planned, or standard cost and the actual amount incurred/sold. Variances can be computed for both costs and revenues.

The concept of variance is intrinsically connected with planned and actual results and effects of the difference between those two on the performance of the entity or company.

==Types of variances==
Variances can be divided according to their effect or nature of the underlying amounts.

When effect of variance is concerned, there are two types of variances:
* When actual results are better than expected results given variance is described as favorable variance. In common use favorable variance is denoted by the letter F - usually in parentheses (F).
* When actual results are worse than expected results given variance is described as adverse variance, or unfavourable variance. In common use adverse variance is denoted by the letter U or the letter A - usually in parentheses (A).

The second typology (according to the nature of the underlying amount) is determined by the needs of users of the variance information and may include e.g.:
* Variable cost variances
** Direct material variances
** Direct labour variances
** Variable production overhead variances
* Fixed production overhead variances
* Sales variances
==Variance analysis==
{{also|Budget analyst|Cost analyst}}
Variance analysis, in budgeting or management accounting in general, is a tool of budgetary control and performance evaluation, assessing any variances between the budgeted, planned, or standard amount, and the actual amount realized. Variance analysis can be carried out for both costs and revenues.

Variance analysis is usually associated with explaining the difference (or variance) between actual costs and the standard costs allowed for the good output. For example, the difference in materials costs can be divided into a materials price variance and a materials usage variance. The difference between the actual direct labor costs and the standard direct labor costs can be divided into a rate variance and an efficiency variance. The difference in manufacturing overhead can be divided into spending, efficiency, and volume variances. Mix and yield variances can also be calculated.

Variance analysis helps management to understand the present costs and then to control future costs.
Variance calculation should always be calculated by taking the planned or budgeted amount and subtracting the actual/forecasted value. Thus a positive number is favorable and a negative number is unfavorable.

<text>Askim () is a district (&quot;stadsdelsnämndsområde&quot;) of the Gothenburg Municipality in Sweden, about south-west of the city centre. To the northwest of Askim is Västra Frölunda, to the east is Mölndal, and the sea is to the west.

As a district, Askim has a local board composed of the same proportions ruling Gothenburg as a whole. The voting base in Askim is predominantly bourgeoisie, while Gothenburg as a whole has a social democratic, socialist and environmentalist majority. This has caused some local tensions due to the strong liberal movement, and a strong local movement works to once again make Askim a separate municipality (&quot;kommun&quot;).

Askim was traditionally inhabited by fishermen. It is now a predominantly upper-middle class area with golf clubs, yacht clubs, and large houses. The less expensive areas are popular with families with children due to a reputation for safety and good schools.

The district of Askim is divided into smaller parts, including Askim, Hovås, Billdal and Skintebo. Beneath Askim lies many historical artifacts dating back to the Stone Age. Many worked pieces of rock show evidence of these times.

It is on the Askim coast, a part of Kattegatt, and has a mountainous terrain. Most of the buildings, which comprise mainly privately owned homes, are concentrated along the coast. The people living here have a much higher income compared to other average citizens of both Gothenburg and Sweden. The football team is Askims IK, whose coach is the famous ex-player Pontus Kåmark, who played in the Sweden national team in 1994.
