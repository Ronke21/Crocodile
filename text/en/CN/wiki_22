<text>Swintayla Marie Cash Canal (born September 22, 1979) is an American former professional basketball player who played professionally for 15 seasons in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). She currently serves as vice president of basketball operations and team development for the New Orleans Pelicans. A prolific scorer and rebounder, as well as a capable ball handler and defender, she helped lead the University of Connecticut women&#x27;s basketball team to national titles in 2000 and 2002. In her second WNBA season, she led the Detroit Shock to their first ever WNBA title. In 2015, she was named a studio analyst for MSG Networks covering the New York Knicks pre-games and post-games as well as the weekly coaches show. In 2017, Cash was named the Director of franchise development for the New York Liberty. Cash was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 9, 2022.

Cash is one of 11 women to receive an Olympic gold medal, an NCAA Championship, a Fiba World cup gold and a WNBA Championship.

==Personal life==
Cash was born in the Pittsburgh suburb of McKeesport and raised by her mother, Cynthia. She has two brothers named Stephen and Kevin Menifee and one sister, Angelique Menifee. She holds basketball camps and clinics under her company, Swin Cash Enterprise LLC, and is involved in charity events through the WNBA. Cash married longtime boyfriend Steve Canal in Atlanta, Georgia.

==High school==
Cash attended McKeesport Area High School in McKeesport, where she participated in many activities. She tried baseball, track and cheerleading. She was also in school plays. Cash is best known for her basketball skills, which earned her a place on the national WBCA All-American team. She participated in the WBCA High School All-America Game where she scored fourteen points, and earned MVP honors.

==College==
Cash was an All-American at the University of Connecticut (UConn). She won the NCAA Women&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship with the UConn Huskies in 2000 and 2002. She also helped lead UConn to an undefeated 39–0 season in 2002. Swin was a member of the inaugural class (2006) of inductees to the University of Connecticut women&#x27;s basketball &quot;Huskies of Honor&quot; recognition program.

==Professional career==
Cash was selected by the Detroit Shock in the 2002 WNBA draft, second overall. After leading the Shock&#x27;s resurgence in the second half of her rookie season, she then led the Detroit Shock to their first WNBA Championship title in 2003. She played in the 2003 WNBA All-Star Game and won the gold medal with the U.S. women&#x27;s basketball team at the 2004 Olympic Games.

In the off-season, Cash has appeared as a studio analyst on ESPN&#x27;s NBA Fastbreak (according to ESPN.com) and during the 2008 Beijing Olympic games, she alternated with Teresa Edwards in presenting in-game commentary for NBC&#x27;s presentation of the women&#x27;s basketball tournament from the network&#x27;s New York broadcast studios. Swin appeared (as herself) in the movie Bring It On: All or Nothing.

Cash received the Dapper Dan Sportswoman of the Year award given to one who shows excellence in the Pittsburgh area. She was also honored with Sidney Crosby and Dan Rooney.

Cash left Detroit for the 2008 season after &quot;struggling to build a consistent relationship with Detroit Shock head coach Bill Laimbeer&quot;. On February 19, 2008 Cash was traded to the Seattle Storm for the 4th pick in the 2008 WNBA draft. The Shock selected Alexis Hornbuckle with their draft pick. Cash along with Sue Bird and Lauren Jackson helped the Storm win their second championship in 2010. On January 2, 2012, in perhaps the WNBA&#x27;s biggest blockbuster trade news thus far, Cash was traded, along with Le&#x27;Coe Willingham, to the Chicago Sky joining All- Star Sylvia Fowles.

Cash has been suffering from a herniated disk for more than two years, an injury suffered while helping the Detroit Shock win the WNBA championship in 2006. In 2009, she came back to Connecticut to lead the Western Conference over the Eastern Conference at Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut. She led all scorers with an All-Star record of 22 points in a 130–118 win. The previous high was 20 by Cash&#x27;s former Detroit teammate, Deanna Nolan, in 2005.

Cash was invited to the USA Basketball Women&#x27;s National Team training camp in the fall of 2009. The team selected to play for the 2010 FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Olympics is usually chosen from these participants. At the conclusion of the training camp, the team will travel to Ekaterinburg, Russia, where they compete in the 2009 UMMC Ekaterinburg International Invitational.
Cash was one of twenty players named to the national team pool. Twelve of this group will be chosen to represent the US in the 2010 World Championships and the 2012 Olympics.

Cash was selected to be a member of the National team representing the US at the World Championships held in September and October 2010. The team was coached by Geno Auriemma. Because many team members were still playing in the WNBA until just prior to the event, the team had only one day of practice with the entire team before leaving for Ostrava and Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. Even with limited practice, the team managed to win its first games against Greece by 26 points. The team continued to dominate with victory margins exceeding 20 points in the first five games. Several players shared scoring honors, with Cash, Angel McCoughtry, Maya Moore, Diana Taurasi, Lindsay Whalen, and Sylvia Fowles all ending as high scorer in the first few games. The sixth game was against undefeated Australia — the USA jumped out to a 24-point lead and the USA prevailed 83–75. The USA won its next two games by over 30 points, then faced the host team, the Czech Republic, in the championship game. The USA team had only a five-point lead at halftime, which was cut to three points, but the Czechs never got closer. Team USA went on to win the championship and gold medal. Cash averaged 8.6 points per game.

Cash was named as one of the National team members to represent the USA Basketball team in the WNBA versus USA Basketball. This game replaces the normal WNBA All-Star game with WNBA All-Stars versus USA Basketball, as part of the preparation for the FIBA World Championship for Women to be held in the Czech Republic during September and October 2010.

Cash was one of 21 finalists for the U.S. Women&#x27;s Olympic Basketball Team Roster. The 20 professional women&#x27;s basketball players, plus one collegiate player (Brittney Griner), were selected by the USA Basketball Women&#x27;s National Team Player Selection Committee to compete for the final roster which will represent the US at the 2012 Olympics in London. Cash made the final roster and played for the U.S. team that won the 2012 Olympic gold medal.

Washington and Jefferson College awarded Cash with an honorary degree in Doctorate of Public Service at their commencement ceremonies in May 2011 to honor her charity work. Cash is the founder of the Pennsylvania-based Cash for Kids charitable organization.

Cash was waived by New York Liberty on May 11, 2016. On May 24, 2016, it was reported that Cash re-signed with the Liberty for the remainder of the season. She was immediately eligible for their game versus the Atlanta Dream on that day.

On June 7, 2016, Cash announced that she would retire at the end of the 2016 season.

== Anti-racism and anti-violence activism ==
Cash is an advocate against gun violence and police brutality. In 2016, she was fined $500 by the Association, along with her teammates and players from two other WNBA teams, for wearing warm up shirts that read &quot;#BlackLivesMatter&quot; and &quot;#Dallas5&quot;, both serving as references to gun violence. In a post-game debriefing following the incident, Cash stated:I think it’s a shame that we keep seeing people that want to make this movement as something that’s violent. Five cops gave their lives up trying to protect a peaceful movement. And in this country, I do believe that you can assemble peacefully and protest against injustice. So until the system transforms, we cannot sit here and act like there is not a problem here in America.She said that part of what motivated her to take a stance against police violence was the Civil Rights Movement era stories her grandmother told her. She recognizes that police brutality is an aspect of racial activism, and she fears that because police are able to kill unarmed people without facing arrests, a regression to pre-Civil Rights laws and practices may occur for black people. In addition, her brother, Kevin Menifee, was allegedly beaten by police officers, who broke his nose.

<text>Thomas Francis Dermot Pakenham, 8th Earl of Longford (born 14 August 1933), known simply as Thomas Pakenham, is an Anglo-Irish hereditary peer, historian and arborist who has written several prize-winning books on the diverse subjects of African history, Victorian and post-Victorian British history and trees.

==Early life and education==
Pakenham is the eldest son of Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford, a Labour government minister, and the author Elizabeth Longford. He has seven siblings, among them the award-winning historian and biographer Lady Antonia Fraser (who is the widow of playwright Harold Pinter); Lady Rachel Billington, also a writer (and the widow of the director Kevin Billington); Lady Judith Kazantzis, a poet; and The Hon. Kevin Pakenham, who worked in the City of London. He is also a cousin of the former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman.

Pakenham was educated at Belvedere College, a private Jesuit school in Dublin, and at Magdalen College, Oxford. After graduating in 1955, he travelled around Ethiopia, a journey that he described in his first book, &quot;The Mountains of Rasselas&quot; (1959). 

==Later life==
After returning to Britain, Pakenham worked on the editorial staff of the &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot; and later for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;. He now divides his time between London and County Westmeath, Ireland, where he is the Chairman of the Irish Tree Society and honorary custodian of Tullynally Castle.

Pakenham owned Longford Greyhound Stadium until 1966, when he sold it to Longford Sports Ltd.

Pakenham does not use the title Earl of Longford and, before succeeding his father in 2001, did not use the courtesy title Lord Silchester. However, he has not disclaimed his British titles of Baron Silchester and Baron Pakenham under the Peerage Act 1963 and his Irish earldom cannot be disclaimed as it is not covered by the Act. Following the House of Lords Act 1999, Pakenham is not entitled as an hereditary peer to a seat in the House of Lords. His father had previously been created a life peer in addition to his hereditary titles in order to retain his seat.

==Marriage and children==
In 1964, Pakenham married Valerie Susan McNair Scott. They have four children.

* Lady Anna Maria Pakenham (born 26 July 1965)
* Lady Eliza Pakenham (born 3 November 1966)
* Edward Melchior Pakenham, Lord Silchester (born 6 January 1970), heir apparent to the earldom.
* Hon Frederick Augustus Pakenham (born 27 November 1971)

Valerie Pakenham died on 22 January 2023 at the age of 83.

<doc id="1235853" wikidata="Q1049886" url="?curid=1235853" title="Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch">
<text>Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch is an album by American musician Frank Zappa, released in May 1982 and digitally remastered in 1991. It features five tracks composed by Zappa, and one song, &quot;Valley Girl&quot;, co-written with his then-14 year old daughter Moon Zappa, who provided the spoken monologue mocking Valley girls, including phrases like &quot;Gag me with a spoon!&quot;.

The album&#x27;s first half consists of studio recordings, while the second half consists of live recordings.

==Production==
Side one was recorded at Zappa&#x27;s Utility Muffin Research Kitchen studio at his home in Los Angeles; while side two consisted of live performances from Zappa&#x27;s fall 1981 U.S. tour with studio overdubs. The live material was originally intended for a double album tentatively titled either &quot;Chalk Pie&quot; or &quot;Crush All Boxes II&quot;, which was scrapped after Zappa&#x27;s record distributor requested a single album instead.

The cover art for the album (from which it gets its name) shows the classic &quot;Droodle&quot;, by Roger Price. The shapes in the cover art also suggest the letters &quot;ZA&quot; (and &quot;P&quot;, sideways), as in &quot;Zappa&quot;. At the time of the album&#x27;s production, Price was living nearby to Zappa.

The phrase &quot;Ebzen Sauce&quot; in &quot;No Not Now&quot; is derived from &quot;Epsom Salt&quot;, an alternative name for magnesium sulfate. This was apparently one of John Smothers&#x27;s (Zappa&#x27;s bodyguard) many malapropisms, which are also referred to in the song &quot;Dong Work for Yuda&quot; from &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; (1979). In the February 1983 issue of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine, the song was said to have an &quot;extremely distinctive bass line&quot;, which Zappa liked &quot;because for people who don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on in the rest of the song, there&#x27;s always the bass line&quot;.

&quot;Valley Girl&quot; – the second song on the album, and the song that would eventually become the album&#x27;s single – was a combination of a guitar riff that Frank had composed, and a desire from his daughter, Moon, to work with her father. Musically, it is one of the most atypical Zappa tunes because of how relatively &quot;normal&quot; it is compared to other compositions, and is played entirely in 4/4 with the exception of the 7/4 groove at the very end. Tom Mulhern observed in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; that the &quot;red-hot&quot; guitar riff had actually been mixed &quot;back in the mix&quot;, which Zappa explained was &quot;because it conflict[ed] with the vocal part. And that red-hot-sounding guitar was just me and the drummer jamming at three o&#x27;clock in the morning. That track was the basis for the song. It was a riff that started off at a soundcheck about a year before, and I had been piddling with it for a long time. One night, we finally did it, saved the tape, and little by little we added all of this other stuff to it, and we got &#x27;Valley Girl&#x27;.&quot; Scott Thunes&#x27;s bass line was spontaneous and played through a Vox amp, and was the final addition to the song, which originally &quot;didn&#x27;t even have a bass part; it was [originally] just guitar and drums&quot;.

The pseudo-title track, &quot;Drowning Witch&quot;, begins with lyrics based around the theme of the cover art, and segues into an instrumental section of typical (for Zappa) complexity and intricacy, featuring musical quotations from &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; by Stravinsky and the &quot;Dragnet&quot; TV theme composed by Walter Schumann and Miklós Rózsa. In &quot;Guitar Player&quot;, Zappa commented that the album version included 15 edits between live performances from different cities.

&quot;Envelopes&quot; was originally written in 1968 – with a prototype recording made that Zappa later recalled as being made the same year, but was in fact recorded in 1970 and eventually included in the posthumous CD box set &quot;The Mothers 1970&quot; (2020) – and is constructed around a harmony based on seven and eight note chords that &quot;generate their own counterpoint as an automatic result of the voice leading&quot;.

Zappa&#x27;s band for the fall 1981 and summer 1982 tours, which he would continue to feature on the next few albums and the &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Stage Anymore&quot; series, included Ray White on rhythm guitar and vocals, Steve Vai on guitar, Tommy Mars on keyboards, Bobby Martin on keyboards, saxophone and vocals, Ed Mann on percussion, Scott Thunes on bass and Chad Wackerman on drums. For studio sessions, he also used past band members including vocalists Ike Willis, Bob Harris and Roy Estrada and bassists Arthur Barrow and Patrick O&#x27;Hearn.

The album &quot;was mixed on JBL 4311 speakers&quot; with MicMix Dynaflanger and Aphex compressors, consequently giving a &quot;played up&quot; prominence to its songs&#x27; bass lines.

==Release history==
The original LP release contained a note that reads &quot;This album has been engineered to sound correct on JBL 4311 speakers or an equivalent. Best results will be achieved if you set your pre-amp tone controls to the flat position with the loudness control in the off position. Before adding any treble or bass to the sound of the album, it would be advisable to check it out this way first. F.Z.&quot;

The LP also featured a &quot;letter from FZ&quot; advertising the &quot;Shut Up &#x27;n Play Yer Guitar&quot; box set, which had previously only been made available separately in the United States and, at the time &quot;Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch&quot; was released, was being made available for the first time in Europe. To promote the release of the UK box set, the first pressing of the UK edition of this album contained a 4-song 7-inch EP with A: &quot;Shut Up &amp; Play Yer Guitar&quot;
B1: &quot;Variations on the Carlos Santana Secret Chord Progression&quot;
B2: &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Read?&quot;.

In some countries outside of the US, Track B1 is entitled on the label as: &quot;Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch&quot;.

It was issued on CD by EMI with &quot;The Man from Utopia&quot; (1983) on the same disc, and separately by Barking Pumpkin, and later Rykodisc.

It also had a release on 8-track tape.

<doc id="1235858" wikidata="Q447463" url="?curid=1235858" title="Ron Simmons">
<text>Ronald K. Simmons (born May 15, 1958) is an American former professional wrestler and football player. He is best known for his tenures in WWE and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Prior to becoming a professional wrestler, Simmons played football as a defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL), Canadian Football League (CFL) and United States Football League (USFL) for four seasons during the 1980s.

Simmons played college football for the Florida State Seminoles and was recognized as an All-American. He played professionally for the NFL&#x27;s Cleveland Browns, the CFL&#x27;s Ottawa Rough Riders and the USFL&#x27;s Tampa Bay Bandits.

Simmons performed for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) under his real name, and in the World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (WWF/E) under both his real name and the ring names Faarooq Asaad (sometimes spelled Asad) and Faarooq (sometimes spelled Farooq). In WCW, Simmons was a one-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion; as the first African American to win the title, he is recognized by WWE as the first Black world champion in professional wrestling history. He was also a one-time WCW World Tag Team Champion with Butch Reed and a one-time WCW United States Tag Team Champion with Big Josh. He was one of the most prominent stars in the WWF in the early Attitude Era. In the WWF, he was a three-time WWF Tag Team Champion with Bradshaw as one half of the Acolytes Protection Agency. Simmons was a sporadic world title contender between ECW and the WWF, and led the Nation of Domination stable in the latter promotion. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2012.

==Football career==
===College career===

Ron Simmons was considered one of Florida State&#x27;s greatest recruiting victories when he signed out of high school. Simmons played four years (1977–1980) as a defensive nose guard at FSU under coach Bobby Bowden (whom Simmons described as &quot;a second father&quot;), earning consensus All-American honors in 1979 and 1980. The Seminoles were 39–8 during Simmons&#x27;s years at the school, finishing in the Associated Press Top 20 three times (&#x27;77, &#x27;79 and &#x27;80), and earning back-to-back Orange Bowl trips after Simmons&#x27;s junior and senior seasons.

In 1979 Simmons finished ninth in the Heisman voting behind the winner, Charles White of USC. In 1988, Simmons&#x27;s jersey (number 50) was retired by FSU, the third time a number has been retired in school history. Simmons was inducted into the Orange Bowl Hall of Fame for his accomplishments while playing at Florida State, and he was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2008.

===Professional football===
He had a brief career in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected in the sixth round of the 1981 NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns. However, he was cut on August 25, 1981. He played in six games for the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League in 1981. He was released by the Rough Riders before the start of the season in July 1982. Simmons then played for the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League from 1983 to 1985, and it was in Tampa where he was a teammate of future professional wrestler Lex Luger.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Jim Crockett Promotions / World Championship Wrestling (1986–1994)===
==== Early years (1986–1988) ====
Simmons joined Jim Crockett Promotions in 1986, appearing on the first show of the Great American Bash tour when he defeated The Tahitian Prince in Lakeland, Florida on July 1. Simmons wrestled only preliminary level competition that summer, but on August 7 he scored the biggest victory of his career when he defeated Ivan Koloff in St Louis. The rookie Simmons defeated the likes of a young Rodney Anoa&#x27;i (Yokozuna) and The Barbarian. On the October 24 episode of Power Pro Wrestling, he became involved in his first televised angle when he was attacked by Tiger Conway Jr. and Shaska Whatley in an interview.

He remained undefeated in singles actions until finally losing to Ivan Koloff on a house show at the Omni in Atlanta on February 14, 1988. Simmons was dominant through the first half of the year against lower-level competition on house shows, including Whatley and The Terminator. Simmons teamed with Steve Williams at the 3rd Annual Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup in Greenville, South Carolina on April 22, 1988. They were defeated in the opening round by Mike Rotunda and Kevin Sullivan when Simmons was hit with a foreign object.

==== Doom (1989–1991) ====

Soon after, in March 1989, Simmons began showing signs of a heel turn as he got more aggressive in his matches, including a non-title match against fellow babyface, then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ricky &quot;The Dragon&quot; Steamboat and a match on the April 29, 1989 episode of World Championship Wrestling, where he broke the rules during what was supposed to be a face vs. face match against Junkyard Dog. Simmons won the match when the referee, Ron&#x27;s future manager Teddy Long made a fast count (Long was fired (kayfabe) as referee by Jim Herd immediately following this match). He completed his heel turn on the May 27 episode of World Championship Wrestling during a tag team match, where he teamed with Ranger Ross against the Samoan Swat Team as part of a tournament for the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship, leaving him in the ring alone when Long came out. Simmons later teamed up with Butch Reed to form Doom. In the beginning, the members of Doom were masked and only known as Doom #1 and Doom #2, managed by Woman. In their pay-per-view debut at Halloween Havoc 1989, Doom defeated The Steiner Brothers. In the &quot;Iron Team Tournament&quot; at Starrcade 1989, Doom finished fourth, losing all three of their matches. Doom&#x27;s misfortune continued as Woman soon dropped the team to manage The Four Horsemen. Then on February 6, 1990, at Clash of the Champions X, Doom hit rock bottom when they were defeated by Rick and Scott Steiner and as a result of the stipulation were forced to unmask.

With new manager Long, they rebounded and defeated The Steiner Brothers for the NWA World Tag Team Championship at Capital Combat in 1990. They held the title for nine months, defeating teams like The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express and feuding with The Four Horsemen. Among their most memorable encounters during their title reign was a street fight against Horsemen Arn Anderson and Barry Windham at Starrcade 1990 which ended in a no-contest when Windham pinned Simmons while Reed simultaneously pinned Anderson. Doom were recognized as the first holders of the WCW World Tag Team Championship in January 1991, finally losing the titles to The Freebirds at WrestleWar in February 1991. Subsequently, Doom broke up, with Simmons turning face and feuding with Reed, defeating him in a cage match at the very first SuperBrawl. Simmons defeated midcarders including Oz and The Diamond Studd, then unsuccessfully challenged Lex Luger for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Halloween Havoc, losing the best-of-three-falls match one fall to two.

==== World Heavyweight Champion and final storylines (1992–1994) ====
Simmons and Matt Borne won the WCW United States tag team championship in January 1992 from the Young Pistols before losing them the following month to Greg Valentine and Terry Taylor. He spent the rest of the first half of 1992 feuding with Cactus Jack. On August 2, 1992, at a house show in Baltimore, Maryland, a scheduled title match between Sting and WCW World Heavyweight Champion Big Van Vader was canceled after Jake Roberts (kayfabe) injured Sting. WCW President Bill Watts responded by holding a raffle to determine the number one contender. Simmons won the raffle and defeated Vader with a snap scoop powerslam to win the championship. By defeating Vader, Simmons became the first recognized African American WCW World Heavyweight Champion and the second African American wrestler to win a World Heavyweight title.

Simmons held the title for five months. He continued to feud with Cactus Jack, whom he defeated via pinfall at SuperBrawl II, with Jack next bringing in The Barbarian to challenge Simmons at Halloween Havoc. Reed, embittered at his former partner&#x27;s success, also unsuccessfully challenged Simmons. At Starrcade, Simmons was scheduled to wrestle Rick Rude, but due to Rude being injured he faced &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams instead, wrestling to a double countout that was changed to a disqualification win for Simmons when Williams attacked him after the match. His title reign ended two days later on December 30, 1992, when Vader defeated him to regain the title.

Afterwards, Simmons was relegated to mid-card status. He was due to face fellow babyface Dustin Rhodes for the United States Heavyweight Championship at Superbrawl III but was injured and replaced with Maxx Payne. He also unsuccessfully challenged Paul Orndorff for the World Television Championship at Beach Blast (1993). In late 1993 he turned on protege Ice Train, becoming a bitter heel who felt like the fans abandoned him after he lost the championship. In the spring of 1994, Simmons was working for WCW without being signed to a contract, also Simmons was briefly managed by Sherri Martel during this time. Simmons competed in the European Cup Tournament, winning his 1st round match against Marcus Bagwell but lost the next round to Sting. He would go on to feud with Sting and Bagwell, mostly competing in tag matches. His final match was a win over Scott Armstrong on the September 10, 1994 edition of WCW Worldwide.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling; New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1994–1995) ===
Simmons debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in September 1994. In November 1994, he began teaming with 2 Cold Scorpio, with the duo unsuccessfully challenging The Public Enemy for the ECW World Tag Team Championship. At November to Remember in November 1994, Simmons unsuccessfully challenged ECW World Heavyweight Champion Shane Douglas. He faced Douglas again in December and January, but was unable to win the title. At Extreme Warfare in March 1995, Simmons defeated Hack Meyers then issued a challenge to 911, who came to the ring and chokeslammed Simmons. The following month at Three Way Dance Simmons lost to Mikey Whipwreck by disqualification after he chokeslammed the referee; following the match, 911 attempted to attack Simmons again, only for Simmons to give 911 a low blow and chokeslam him. At Hostile City Showdown later that month, 911 defeated Simmons after chokeslamming him off the top rope. Simmons made his final appearances with ECW in May 1995.

In January and February 1995, Simmons wrestled in Japan with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) as part of its &quot;Fighting Spirit&quot; tour. During the tour, he largely teamed with other American wrestlers such as Flying Scorpio, Mike Enos, and Scott Norton in tag team matches and six-man tag team matches, facing opponents such as Kensuke Sasaki, Masa Saito, Shinya Hashimoto, and Tadao Yasuda. Simmons made a second tour with NJPW in May and June 1995, again teaming with American wrestlers such as Arn Anderson, Mike Enos, and Steve Austin.

Following his appearances with ECW and NJPW, Simmons went into semi-retirement. He began working as a warehouse manager for a Coca-Cola factory on the outskirts of Atlanta, Georgia.

===World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment===
==== Nation of Domination (1996–1998) ====

In 1996, Simmons returned to professional wrestling, signing a contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He made his debut on the July 22, 1996, episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. His first gimmick was that of &quot;Faarooq Asad&quot;, a gladiator/street thug who wore a black and blue gladiator outfit with a misshaped helmet and was managed by Sunny. Simmons started his first feud with Ahmed Johnson before shortening his ring name to Faarooq. The feud was started when Faarooq attacked Johnson during a tag team match pitting Johnson and Shawn Michaels against the Smoking Gunns. As a result of the injuries sustained, Johnson vacated the WWF Intercontinental Championship. In the subsequent tournament, Faarooq lost in the finals to Marc Mero.

In November 1996, Faarooq dropped his gladiator gimmick, parted ways with Sunny and formed the Nation of Domination (NOD), a stable loosely based on the Nation of Islam and the Black Panther Party, although the members of the stable were not exclusively African American. They initially feuded with Ahmed Johnson. At the Royal Rumble 1997, Johnson defeated Farooq by disqualification. In the Royal Rumble match, Johnson eliminated himself when he saw Faarooq in the aisle and chased after him. Later in the same match Faarooq was eliminated when Johnson returned and attacked him with a 2x4. At WrestleMania 13 Johnson and the Legion of Doom defeated the NOD in a Chicago Street Fight.

After losing to WWF Champion The Undertaker, at the 1997 King of the Ring, Faarooq blamed Crush and Savio Vega for his loss and threw them out of the NOD. Both formed their rival factions, known respectively as the Disciples of Apocalypse and Los Boricuas, and Faarooq recruited more African American members for the NOD, including half-Samoan Rocky Maivia. The three stables feuded with one another throughout 1997. In the summer of 1997, Faarooq again lost a tournament final for the WWF Intercontinental Championship, this time to Owen Hart after Stone Cold Steve Austin interfered. Austin, who had forfeited the title due an injury inflicted by Hart, wanted Hart to win so he could again beat him for the title.

In early 1998, Faarooq&#x27;s leadership of the NOD was increasingly challenged by Maivia, who had shortened his name to The Rock and felt he should be the leader as he was now Intercontinental Champion. In the Royal Rumble match, all five NOD members were in the ring at the same time and frequently brawled with each other, Faarooq even eliminating his fellow members D&#x27;Lo Brown and Mark Henry; he was one of the final three along with the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. Faarooq wanted the Rock to help him eliminate Austin, but the Rock refused and eliminated Faarooq. The following month at No Way Out of Texas: In Your House, the Nation of Domination lost a 10-man tag team match to Ken Shamrock, Ahmed Johnson, Chainz, Skull and 8 Ball when The Rock submitted to an ankle lock by Shamrock. After the match Faarooq and The Rock almost came to blows. At Wrestlemania XIV, Faarooq and Kama were unsuccessful in the tag team battle royal. Later in the evening, Faarooq was the only NOD member absent from The Rock&#x27;s title defense against Ken Shamrock. When Shamrock put The Rock in an ankle lock, Faarooq ran down to the ring but decided against helping him and walked off, with the crowd cheering his decision, thus turning him face. The following night on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, the Rock assumed leadership of the NOD and kicked Faarooq out of the group. Faarooq spent the next several months feuding with his former stablemates. Faarooq feuded with The Rock but failed to win the Intercontinental title at Over the Edge: In Your House. Also this time Simmons then teamed briefly with 2 Cold Scorpio and worked mainly on Shotgun Saturday Night and house shows. 

==== Acolytes Protection Agency (1998–2004)====
After feuding with the Nation, in November 1998, Simmons began teaming with Bradshaw as the Acolytes, a violent tag team sporting occult symbolism on their tights and chests. They were managed by The Jackyl until he left the WWF, at which point they were reintroduced as members of the Ministry of Darkness led by The Undertaker. The Acolytes recruited Phineas I. Godwinn and Mabel to the Ministry by kidnapping and brainwashing them (renaming them &quot;Mideon&quot; and &quot;Viscera&quot;, respectively), and feuded with The Undertaker&#x27;s rivals, such as D-Generation X and The Brood, the latter of which later joined the Ministry as well.

During this time the Acolytes had two short reigns as tag team champions; they defeated the team of Kane and X-Pac but lost the title to the Hardy Boyz. At the Fully Loaded pay-per-view in 1999, they won the title back in a no disqualification handicap match against the Hardyz and Michael Hayes. Their second reign ended when they lost the title to Kane and X-Pac.

After the Undertaker suffered an injury in late 1999, the Ministry of Darkness disbanded. Faarooq and Bradshaw continued to team with one another, and eventually adopted the gimmick of two brawlers who enjoyed drinking beer and smoking cigars. After Bradshaw began hiring out the services of the Acolytes as mercenaries and bodyguards, the tag team was renamed the &quot;Acolytes Protection Agency&quot; (APA). Around this time, Faarooq adopted his &quot;Damn!&quot; catchphrase. The team won their third tag team title by defeating the Dudley Boyz in June 2001 but lost the titles the following month to Diamond Dallas Page and Chris Kanyon when Test interfered.

The APA teamed together until 2002, when Faarooq was drafted to the SmackDown! brand. Around this time, Ron Simmons began wrestling under his real name, as the terrorist group Al-Qaeda had a training camp called Al-Faarooq. Simmons had a brief heel run when he teamed with Reverend D-Von until he left television in December 2002, but in June 2003 he returned to WWE with Bradshaw and the APA reunited.

In his last WWE storyline, he was fired by SmackDown! General Manager Paul Heyman after the APA lost a match WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty. It was assumed that the APA was fired, but Heyman told Bradshaw he was allowed to stay. Simmons retired from his in-ring career, accusing Bradshaw of not being a faithful friend in storyline. In reality, Simmons, who had been planning to retire due to his health and age, became a backstage agent for the company.

====Sporadic appearances, &quot;Damn!&quot; and Hall of Famer (2006–present)====

In 2006, during a rebroadcast of the 1981 Orange Bowl on Sun Sports, Simmons stated that since his retirement from professional wrestling, he would like to continue or even improve his role within WWE. Starting on October 23, 2006, he began making short cameos on &quot;Raw&quot; to say his catchphrase &quot;Damn&quot;, often in awe of or shock at odd occurrences. For a long time it was his only spoken word on a given show.

On the November 20, 2006 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Simmons was chosen by Ric Flair to replace the injured Roddy Piper at the Survivor Series to take on the Spirit Squad. He was the first to be eliminated, via countout. On the January 15, 2007 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he was seen in the ring with Chris Masters in the &quot;Master Lock Challenge&quot;, which ended prematurely after interference from Super Crazy. Simmons&#x27;s escaping the Master Lock, was not recognized. On the July 27, 2007 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Simmons was named the best man for Theodore Long and Kristal&#x27;s wedding.

Simmons also feuded with Santino Marella. On the September 10, 2007 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Simmons was attacked by Marella. On the September 24, 2007, edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Simmons returned to the ring and defeated Santino Marella by countout after Marella left the ring and walked out. Simmons occasionally competed on &quot;WWE Heat&quot;, taking on jobbers from the town in which the show is being taped. At the end of each match, Simmons held a microphone, pulling it toward and away from his mouth while the crowd cheered him until he eventually uttered his catchphrase. On the December 3, 2007 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Simmons and Bradshaw were hired by Hornswoggle to help him in a no disqualification handicap match against Jonathan Coachman and Carlito.

On &quot;Raw&quot;″s 800th episode on November 3, 2008, Simmons interrupted wrestlers, who were dancing in the ring, with his catchphrase. During the 2008 Slammy Awards, he gave The Great Khali the award for the DAMN Moment of the year. Simmons was released from WWE on January 13, 2009, due to budget cuts but repeatedly reappeared on various WWE events to interrupt awkward situations with his catchphrase. Occasions include episodes of &quot;WWE Old School Raw&quot; (November 15, 2010 and January 6, 2014) and &quot;Raw&quot; (May 2, 2011 and January 28, 2013), &quot;Hell in a Cell 2012&quot; and WrestleManias 30 and 31.

Simmons would wrestle in the independent circuit from 2008 to 2012. He wrestled his final match on March 17, 2012, teaming with former WWE wrestler Brian Christopher defeating former Nation of Domination stable mates PG-13 (J. C. Ice and Wolfie D) at Crossfire Wrestling in Nashville, Tennessee.
Simmons was also credited in the tribute as being the first African American world heavyweight champion in WCW. Simmons was acknowledged as a memorable character in WWE&#x27;s &quot;Attitude Era&quot;. On March 31 by his APA partner John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield. He ended his Hall of Fame speech with his signature &quot;Damn&quot; once again. Simmons and Layfield reunited as the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA) on the 1000th episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, providing their signature protection and back-up for Lita during her match with Heath Slater. After Layfield hit Slater with the Clothesline from Hell, Simmons took to the microphone exclaiming &quot;Damn!&quot;

In 2012, Simmons was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. In 2014, Simmons made several appearances for Maryland Championship Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;Autumn Armageddon&quot; tour.

On the January 19, 2015 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, during a &quot;Raw Reunion&quot; segment, Simmons came out to help the nWo (Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and Sean Waltman) and The New Age Outlaws (Billy Gunn and Road Dogg) and John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield against the Ascension (Konnor and Viktor).

Simmons appeared at the &quot;Raw 25 Years&quot; show on January 22, 2018, and attended the 2018 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony. He also appeared at the &quot;Raw Reunion&quot; show on July 22, 2019, in a backstage segment involving Mike and Maria Kanellis, Eve Torres, and Jimmy Hart; using Hart&#x27;s megaphone to exclaim &quot;Damn!&quot;

Simmons also appeared on January 23, 2023, at Raw is XXX when Baron Corbin and JBL won a poker game to win money, but then they lost the money because they had to pay their &quot;taxes&quot;. Simmons then came into view shook his head and said &quot;Damn!&quot;

<text>Aerolitoral, S.A. de C.V., DBA Aeroméxico Connect, and formerly known as Aerolitoral, is the subsidiary airline of Aeroméxico operating Embraer 190 aircraft, with crew bases in Mexico City and Monterrey. It is headquartered in Monterrey. It operates feeder services to Aeroméxico&#x27;s hub airports, using four-digit flight numbers. It is considered the biggest and most important regional airline in Mexico, offering more than 300 scheduled flights daily to 42 destinations in Mexico, eleven in the United States, five in Central America, and two in the Caribbean. Its main bases are Guadalajara, Mexico City, and Monterrey. Aeroméxico Connect flights are marketed as Aeroméxico.

==History==
===1988 to early 1990s===
The airline was established in 1988 as Servicios Aéreos Litoral, to later become a subsidiary of Aeroméxico on December 1, 1990. It started with a fleet of 4 NAMC YS-11 aircraft in 1988 (XA-ROL, XA-ROV, XA-RPU, and XA-RRG) and was originally based in Veracruz. In February 1992, Aeroméxico started another regional feeder airline, Aerovías de Poniente, S.A. de C.V. based in Guadalajara using Fairchild Metroliners. The fleet was replaced and expanded quite fast between 1991 and 1995 and grew to a total of 29 Fairchild Metro III and Fairchild Metro 23 aircraft between the two feeders.

===Mid 1990s===
In 1991, the main base was moved to Monterrey and in 1992, Aeroponiente started operations from Guadalajara. The pilot seniority list was merged, and a common paint scheme was adopted using the Aeroméxico logo. Since 1992, Aerolitoral has been the only source of pilots for Aeroméxico with more than 400 pilots transferred until today. In 1993, a small base was opened in Culiacán and after 3 months was moved to Chihuahua. By 1995, the commuter airline had three bases with 29 airplanes.

The route network expanded all across the north of Mexico, and some routes to the United States were operated for a brief period, such as: Harlingen, McAllen, Corpus Christi, and Austin in Texas as well as to Albuquerque, New Mexico. The main U.S. routes operated in this period were San Antonio, Tucson, El Paso, and Phoenix.

In 1996, the two airlines were merged into Aerolitoral S.A de C.V., causing some labor problems to continue during 1997, and a pilot strike in the same year. There was a high demand for a bigger airplane in the route network and the Fairchild Metroliner 19 seater was not enough. After a long selection, Saab 340s were introduced in late 1997. In 1998 new services to the United States were added from Piedras Negras. and from Chihuahua to Dallas.

In early 1999, Aerolitoral was operating 29 Fairchild Metroliners and 6 Saab 340s. One Fairchild Metroliner had been converted to freighter and operations to Mexico City were resumed on behalf of Aeromexpress. In August 1999, a new CEO was appointed and Raúl Sáenz Campos replaced Carlos Treviño after a long time being at the airline. On December of the same year, the directive board decided to start a fleet renewal process, by replacing the first 3 Metroliners.

===Early 2000s===

In the period between the years 2000 and 2002, 13 more Saab 340Bs were added to replace Metros, with a peak fleet of 22 Saab 340Bs.
On the third quarter of 2001, services to San Diego via Mexicali, to Zacatecas via Puerto Vallarta, and Monterrey were launched. Nevertheless, these services were discontinued shortly after 9/11 Attacks. On September 6, 2001, there was an accident without any fatalities, it was a Saab 340 with registration XA-ACK which crash-landed 15 miles southeast of Tijuana. The airplane suffered fuel starvation, due to a false indication in the flight deck fuel gauges, caused by a defective element on the system, reflecting more fuel than the aircraft actually had.

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Aerolitoral experienced a drop in air traffic and downsized the fleet in order to survive. Services to San Diego, El Paso, and Laredo were canceled. San Antonio, Phoenix, and Tucson were reduced, moreover with the growth of Aviacsa on the domestic market with its Boeing 737-200 fleet invading the most profitable routes from Monterrey to León, Ciudad Juárez, Culiacán, and Guadalajara. The small commuter experienced severe financial troubles, and in 2002, many employees were laid off, among them 50 pilots. In 2002, services to Los Angeles and Ontario, California were introduced on behalf of Aeroméxico, while services to Phoenix and Laredo were cancelled.

In early 2003, with a fleet of 3 Fairchild Metroliners and 22 Saab 340s, the load factors were recovering as with many other airlines around the globe. That same year, Aerolitoral announced the acquisition of the first 5 Embraer ERJ 145, with deliveries starting in mid-2004. In December 2003, after operating a peak fleet for 13 years with 28 planes, the last Metroliners were retired. Early the next year, the first 3 ERJ 145&#x27;s arrived from Brazil to Monterrey and started to replace the Saabs on the routes from Monterrey lasting over 1 hour, 50 minutes. The first flights were mainly to Chihuahua, Guadalajara, and Ciudad Juárez, and two of the same aircraft were added later that year. In this same year, a wet lease contract from was signed between Aerocaribe and AeroLitoral. The agreement stated that Aerolitoral would provide service in the routes on the South East of the country on behalf of Aerocaribe. The contract covered the wet lease of 3 Saab 340s operating the routes to Mérida, Tuxla Gutierrez, and the shuttle between Cancún and Cozumel. The agreement lasted a year and ended in late May 2005.

===Mid 2000s===
In 2005, the first scheduled services in and out of Mexico City on behalf of Aeroméxico were introduced to Ciudad Obregón and Los Mochis, using ERJ 145 aircraft. During this year, five more ERJ 145s were introduced to the fleet, introducing new routes to central Mexico and the southeast of the country, as well as increasing the size of the fleet to 10 aircraft.

In 2006, Aerolitoral took over services from Mexico City to Campeche and Durango, previously operated by Aeromar on behalf of Aeroméxico, and resumed operations to Reynosa, Oaxaca, and other Aeroméxico non-revenue city pairs. By the end of 2006, an ERJ crew base in Mexico City was established, 13 more ERJs were introduced to the fleet, most of them in addition, bringing the number of 23 by the end of the year.

In 2007, Aerolitoral returned to Austin on behalf of Aeroméxico from Mexico City, reopened the hub in Guadalajara with an ERJ fleet, which grew to 32 frames. In November 2007, Aeroméxico announced that Aerolitoral was going to become Aeroméxico Connect once the Embraer 190s arrived, and so it did. The airline changed its corporate name, image, and introduced a new philosophy of complementing Aeroméxico on some domestic and international flights, instead of only feeding the airline&#x27;s hubs. The first four brand-new Embraer 190 arrived in October 2007 and early 2008, and the airline announced an order for 12 more frames that started arriving in early 2009. On November, SkyTeam painted Aeroméxico Connect&#x27;s ERJ 145 in SkyTeam livery.

==Destinations==
Aeroméxico Connect has grown over the past few years in the Mexican domestic market. It has come from being a feeder airline to a key on Aeroméxico&#x27;s strategy to remain in the industry. As new aircraft have been added since 2004, Aeroméxico has been shifting many of its domestic and short-haul international routes to Aeroméxico Connect. The intended plan of the holding consortium of the two airlines is to keep developing Aeroméxico Connect in those markets where mainline Aeroméxico would not profit, moreover after the addition of the Embraer 190 that is capable of operating on some longer routes that were formerly served by mainline Aeroméxico with McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and MD-87 aircraft. Also of interest is the airline´s choice to replace its ERJ 145 fleet with newer Embraer 170 and 190 jets, currently under manufacture for Aeroméxico. Three new Embraer 170s arrived in the summer of 2012. They fully replaced the ERJ 145 in 2017. The airline serves international destinations in Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the United States, while offering serving regional routes throughout Mexico.

==Accidents and Incidents==
Aeroméxico Connect and its predecessor, Aerolitoral, have never had an accident with loss of life, although it has had 6 accidents, with 2 hull losses.
*On 6 September 2001 at 12:35 local time, an Aerolitoral Saab 340 (registered XA-ACK) encountered a failure of its second engine, forcing the pilots to perform an emergency landing on a field in Valle de Las Palmas. The aircraft had been operating Flight 2130 from Ciudad Juárez to Tijuana with 29 passengers and three crew members on board, none of whom were seriously injured even though the airplane was damaged beyond repair.
*On 21 January 2010 at 12:24 local time, Aeroméxico Connect Flight 2051 from Hermosillo to Los Angeles veered off the runway upon diverting at Tijuana International Airport in bad weather conditions which included gusty winds. There were no injuries among the 39 people on board the Embraer ERJ 145 involved (registered XA-WAC), which was repaired and returned to service.
*On 10 May 2010, an Embraer ERJ 145 operating as Aeroméxico Connect Flight 921 reported an unsafe gear indication upon approach. Onboard the flight, with service to Mexico City from Monterrey, were 27 passengers. The crew aborted the approach and entered a holding for troubleshooting, the unsafe indication continued. After a subsequent low approach, the tower reported all gear appeared to be properly down. The airplane landed safely about 30 minutes after aborting the first approach.
*On 23 June 2011, Aeroméxico Connect Flight 2471 with service to Mexico City from Nuevo Laredo, was hit by two bolts of lightning. The Embraer ERJ 145, registered XA-SLI with 43 people on board, suffered system damage. Smells of smoke in the cockpit caused the pilots to divert to Monterrey for a safe landing. No injuries were reported, and the plane sustained minor damage.
*On 17 March 2012, an Embraer ERJ 145 registered XA-TAC encountered a loss of cabin pressure. Flight 2469 was en route to Monterrey from Veracruz with 48 passengers and three crew. At FL320 near Tampico, Tamaulipas, the crew initiated an emergency descent and a diversion to Tampico International Airport. The aircraft landed safely with no injuries reported.
*On 31 July 2018, Aeroméxico Connect Flight 2431, operated by an Embraer 190 registered XA-GAL, crashed while attempting to take off from Durango Airport. Although no one died in the accident, the resulting fire consumed the aircraft.

<text>The Offenhauser Racing Engine, or Offy, is a racing engine design that dominated American open wheel racing for more than 50 years and is still popular among vintage sprint and midget car racers.

==History==

The Offenhauser engine, familiarly known as the &quot;Offy&quot;, was an overhead cam monoblock 4-stroke internal combustion engine developed by Fred Offenhauser and Harry Arminius Miller. Originally, it was sold as a marine engine. In 1930 a four-cylinder Miller engine installed in a race car set a new international land speed record of . Miller developed this engine into a twin overhead cam, four-cylinder, four-valve-per-cylinder racing engine. Variations of this design were used in midgets and sprints into the 1960s, with a choice of carburetion or Hilborn fuel injection. When both Miller and the company to whom he had sold much of the equipment and rights went bankrupt in 1933, Offenhauser opened a shop a block away and bought rights to engines, special tooling and drawings at the bankruptcy auction, and he and other former Miller employees took over production. They and former Miller employee, draftsman Leo Goossen, further developed the Miller engines into the Offenhauser engines.

In 1946, the name Offenhauser and engine designs were sold to Louis Meyer and Dale Drake. It was under Meyer and Drake that the engine dominated the Indianapolis 500 and midget racing in the United States. In 1965, Meyer was bought out by Drake, his wife Eve and their son John. From then until Drake&#x27;s son John sold the shop to Stewart Van Dyne, the Drake family designed and refined the engine until its final race days.

One of the keys to the Offenhauser engine&#x27;s success and popularity was its power. A 251.92 cubic inch (4,128.29 cm³) DOHC naturally-aspirated four-cylinder racing Offy with a 15:1 compression ratio and a bore and stroke could produce at 6,600 rpm (1.77 hp per cubic inch, 81 kW/L) making it remarkably power-dense. Other variants of the engine produced even higher outputs of 3 hp per cubic inch (137 kW/L), unparalleled for their size and capacity in power-to cubic-inch/cylinder-count ratio. Another reason for the engine&#x27;s success was its reliability. Its monobloc construction made it immune to head gasket or cylinder stud problems, and allowed for higher cylinder pressures.

From 1934 through the 1970s, the Offenhauser engine dominated American open-wheel racing, winning the Indianapolis 500 27 times. From 1950 through 1960, Offenhauser-powered cars won the Indianapolis 500 and achieved all three podium positions, winning the pole position in 10 of the 11 years.

The Offenhauser shop began to do machine work for Lockheed in 1940, as the arms build-up for anticipated war began. The last prewar engine was shipped on July 17, 1941, and the plant began producing hydraulic systems after the Pearl Harbor attack. Leo Goossen finally became a full-time Offenhauser employee in 1944, and Fred Offenhauser sold the company in 1946.

In 1959 Lime Rock Park held a famous Formula Libre race, where Rodger Ward shocked the expensive and exotic sports car contingent by beating them on the road course in an Offenhauser powered midget car, which was normally considered competitive on oval tracks only. On the strength of this performance, the car was entered in the Formula 1 1959 US Grand Prix at Sebring, where it was totally uncompetitive, setting a qualifying time of 3:43.8 compared to the pole time of 3 minutes dead and being the slowest Formula 1 starter at 3:33.4.

When Ford came onto the scene in 1963, the Offy began to lose its domination over Indy car racing, although it remained a competitive winner on the circuit including at the 500 through the mid-1970s even with the advent of turbocharging. A more powerful turbocharged version of the engine was used by Offenhauser in 1968, and gave Bobby Unser the win that year. The engine made @ 9,500 rpm, from a displacement of only . Outputs over could be attained, using around of boost pressure. The final 2.65-litre four-cylinder Offy, restricted to boost, produced at 9,000 rpm. The Offy&#x27;s final victory came at Trenton in 1978, in Gordon Johncock&#x27;s Wildcat. The last time an Offy-powered car raced was at Pocono in 1982 for the Domino&#x27;s Pizza Pocono 500, in an Eagle chassis driven by Jim McElreath, although two Vollstedt chassis with Offenhauser engines failed to qualify for the 1983 Indianapolis 500.

==Common Offenhauser engines==

Offenhauser produced engine blocks in several sizes. These blocks could be bored out or sleeved to vary the cylinder bore, and could be used with crankshafts of various strokes, resulting in a wide variety of engine displacements. Offenhauser (and Meyer-Drake, in later years) frequently made blocks, pistons, rods, and crankshafts to specific customer requests. However, certain engine sizes were common, and could be considered the &quot;standard&quot; Offenhauser engines:

* - to meet the displacement rule in many midget series
* - displacement rule in AAA (later USAC) sprint cars
* - displacement rule for the Indianapolis 500 under AAA rules
* - for Indianapolis (during the 1930s fuel consumption rules)
* - displacement rule for Indianapolis under USAC rules
* - displacement rule for turbocharged engines at Indianapolis (to 1968)
* - displacement rule for turbocharged engines at Indianapolis (1969 and later)

==World Championship Indianapolis 500 summary==
From 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 was a round of the World Drivers&#x27; Championship.

<doc id="1235865" wikidata="Q7902494" url="?curid=1235865" title="Utah Transit Authority">
<text>The Utah Transit Authority (UTA) is a special service district responsible for providing public transportation throughout the Wasatch Front of Utah, in the United States, which includes the metropolitan areas of Ogden, Park City, Provo, Salt Lake City and Tooele. It operates fixed route buses, flex route buses, express buses, ski buses, three light rail lines in Salt Lake County (TRAX), a streetcar line in Salt Lake City (the S-Line), and a commuter rail train (&quot;FrontRunner&quot;) from Ogden through Salt Lake City to Provo. UTA is headquartered in Salt Lake City with operations and garages in locations throughout the Wasatch Front, including Ogden, Midvale and Orem. Light rail vehicles are stored and maintained at yards at locations in South Salt Lake and Midvale. UTA&#x27;s commuter rail equipment is stored and serviced at a facility in Salt Lake City. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== History ==
The Utah Transit Authority traces its roots to 1953 when several bus companies united to form the organization. Ironically, among the constitutive companies of the UTA was National City Lines, famous for its alleged cannibalization of American streetcar lines on behalf of General Motors. NSL had bought out and promptly decommissioned the electric trolleys operated by the Utah Light and Traction Company in Salt Lake City neighborhoods like the Avenues in the 1940s.

Throughout the 1950s buses became more and more unpopular, with low gas prices and subsidized construction of highways like Interstate 15. By 1960, bus ridership was only about one third the level of war-time Salt Lake, and the average age of riders was 14.

In 1969, the Utah State Legislature passed the Utah Public Transit District Act, which allowed individual communities to address transportation needs by forming local transit districts. UTA was subsequently founded on March 3, 1970, when the cities of Sandy, Salt Lake City, and Murray voted to form a transit district. Service was extended to Weber and Davis counties in 1973 and to Utah County in 1985. Today, the UTA&#x27;s service area is over and covers seven counties: Box Elder, Davis, Salt Lake, Summit, Tooele, Utah, and Weber.

UTA saw rapid expansion through the mid-1970s and 1980s. It strove to streamline the bus system, connecting the east and west sides of the Salt Lake Valley with east–west routes along 2100 South, 3300 South/3500 South, and 4500 South/4700 South, in 1975. Four bus routes to Granger, Hunter (which today comprise West Valley City), Kearns, Magna, and Tooele were also created the same year. Sunday service on 25 routes began in 1975, only to be removed in 1988. (Sunday service resumed in 2001.) In 1976, the UTA began offering ski bus service to Alta, Brighton, Snowbird, and Solitude ski resorts in Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons. Today, the UTA offers seasonal buses to those four resorts as well as Snowbasin Resort and Powder Mountain in Weber County and Sundance Resort in Utah County.

Since the turn of the century, the entire service area of UTA has seen bus route redesigns, beginning with Utah County in 2000. Weber and Davis Counties saw an overhaul of their bus routing in 2002. The largest and most comprehensive change in routing occurred in August 2007 in Salt Lake County, with the goal of increasing ridership by twelve percent. Prior to 2007, night service had different numbering and routing than regular daytime service. After the redesign, nighttime routes were to retain the same routing and numbering as their daytime counterparts. Routes were consolidated as well, with 69 routes reduced to 60. Fifteen-minute service during weekday daytime hours was extended from two to 11 routes, and all other routes in the system had 30-minute service during weekday peak hours at the very least. &quot;Fast buses,&quot; which connected suburbs to the city and charged the same fare as local buses (as opposed to express buses, which required a higher fare), were also introduced and expanded. The redesign proposal was met with criticism, with low-income advocacy groups claiming that the redesign focused too heavily on commuters rather than the disadvantaged. The route redesign achieved its intended goal—from 2007 to 2011, bus ridership in the entire system increased from 77,500 to 88,700, an increase of 18 percent.

Beginning in 2010, a decline in funding that UTA was receiving from sales tax revenues resulted in service reductions. Fast bus trips were substantially reduced, with many fast bus routes being cut altogether. Saturday and night service saw cuts as well. The opening of two new TRAX extensions exacerbated bus route service cuts, especially in the western side of the valley; routes that previously traveled from the western suburbs to downtown would end at Green Line stations, with riders expected to complete the rest of their journeys via the Green Line. For the first time in 2010, there was no service on Memorial and Labor days. Service on those holidays was later restored, and as of 2020 UTA provides bus and rail service on most holidays with the exception of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day. As UTA&#x27;s rail expansion projects draw to a close and revenues increase, the agency has indicated that it will slowly begin restoring service in the near future.

Amidst the service cuts and rail expansions, UTA struck a deal with Park City and Summit County to begin operating an express bus between Salt Lake City and Park City in October 2011. This express service was called PC-SLC Connect until High Valley Transit took over the route with its 107 service.

== Bus service ==

UTA currently offers over 120 bus routes within its operational area. Most of these routes provide regular transportation throughout the day, while many are primarily commuter routes. Some are special services, such as ski routes that only operate seasonally. Current ski routes include route 953 (Alta/Snowbird/Midvale), route 972 (Brighton/Solitude/Midvale), route 994 (Alta/Snowbird/Sandy), Route 880 (Sundance/Provo), route 674 (Powder Mountain/Ogden), route 675 (Snowbasin/Ogden) and route 677 (Snowbasin/Layton). Occasionally, will also offer service for special events or extend service on certain days of the year such as New Year&#x27;s Eve. UTA regularly modifies or changes its bus routes, but whenever reasonably possible (other than temporary detours) limits the adjustments to Change Days. The majority of bus routes stay within the Ogden to Provo corridor, with limited service south to Santaquin, in Utah County, and north to Brigham City, in Box Elder County. Service to Santaquin is limited to one route, the 805, which is an Express bus to Utah Valley University. In Brigham City, Rt. 630 connects Downtown Brigham City with the Ogden Transit Center. Rt. F638, (F stands for Flex route) runs around Brigham City approximately every hour from 8am-4pm every weekday, no weekend service.

=== Bus rapid transit ===

The Utah Valley Express line operates between Provo Central station and Orem Central station via Brigham Young University and Utah Valley University, utilizing a dedicated busway across most of the route located in the center median of University Parkway, University Avenue, and East 700 North. The line opened in August 2018 and uses 60-foot articulated buses with doors on both sides of the bus to load passengers from busway stations located in the center median.

The Ogden Express line is a line between Ogden Central station and McKay-Dee Hospital, utilizing a dedicated busway that cuts through the campus of Weber State University and in the center median of Harrison Boulevard. On August 29, 2022, a short section of the line, entirely on the Weber State University busway opened. The rest of the line opened on August 20, 2023. The line uses 40-foot battery-electric buses.

UTA previously operated the 3500 South MAX line between Magna and the Millcreek TRAX station via West Valley City. The line was suspended in 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and is now permanently discontinued.

=== Free trolley service ===

UTA has three bus routes that run trolley-replica buses, the 601, 628, and 667, which serve Ogden, Midtown (Clearfield/Layton) and Farmington (Lagoon amusement park), respectively. Service is free on these routes. All three routes run 30-minute service on weekdays, and 60-minute service on Saturdays. None of the three routes run on Sunday.

=== Flex routes ===
UTA has 17 bus routes that are allowed to deviate up to from their set route to pick up or drop off passengers. These &quot;flexible&quot; routes are called Flex routes and are indicated by the letter &quot;F&quot; at the beginning of the route number (e.g. F618). Flex routes combine the convenience of curb-to-curb service with regular fixed routes making them a viable option for many paratransit riders. Certain rules and restrictions apply to Flex routes:
*Only two deviations are allowed per trip; however, even with deviations, routes maintain a schedule and never depart designated stops early.
*Riding Flex routes costs the same as regular routes; however, the cost for deviations is an additional $1.25 (in addition to the regular fare).
*Deviations may be scheduled up to seven days in advance but not less than two hours prior to travel time and can be made by calling 801-BUS-RIDE (801-287-7433) between 8:30 a.m. and 3 p.m.

=== Paratransit ===

Throughout its area of operation, UTA provides paratransit service in addition to its FLEX routes for qualifying disabled passengers that are unable to, either temporarily or permanently, utilized the other transportation services provided by UTA (including bus service, TRAX, the S-Line, and &quot;FrontRunner&quot;). Although the cost to UTA for this service is substantial to UTA, the fare remains the same for passengers.

Paratransit fare is $4 for one-way curb-to-curb transportation. Riders must be pre-qualified to use the service.

=== Transit centers ===
UTA operates three transit centers which are open and staffed by customer service personnel during business hours (or extended business hours) Monday through Friday (except holidays). The first two are Salt Lake Central station and Ogden Central station, which are both served by &quot;FrontRunner&quot; and inter-county and local bus service (as well as TRAX, in the case of Salt Lake Central). All other transportation hubs operated by UTA (including Central Pointe, Murray Central, West Valley Central, Orem Central and Provo) stations are not staffed by customer service personnel.

In addition to the transit centers, UTA offers customer service by telephone for extended business hours Monday through Saturday. In addition to English, assistance can usually be provided in the following languages: Chinese, French, Spanish, Tongan, and Vietnamese.

=== Commuter rail ===
== TRAX light rail ==
Population growth and accompanying congestion led to the study of the feasibility of light rail in the Salt Lake Valley in the early 1990s. A 1993 initiative to use tax revenues to purchase an underutilized rail corridor for potential light rail use was rejected by Salt Lake County voters. The County Commission opposed increasing taxes for light rail and even hired a lobbyist to this end. Nonetheless, the Utah Transit Authority moved forward and was able to make the purchase using other available funds.
UTA also lobbied for funding and in August 1995 won $240 million from the federal government as part of the budget for I-15 reconstruction. The light rail system was called TRAX. This federal grant amounted to over two-thirds the cost of the Blue Line to Sandy, and further bills would fund a second line to the University of Utah. Salt Lake City&#x27;s successful bid to host the 2002 Winter Olympics gave the light rail project some priority over transit projects in other cities competing for federal funds; Secretary of Transportation Federico Peña explained, &quot;The Winter Olympics in Salt Lake are not just Salt Lake&#x27;s Olympics. They are the nation&#x27;s Olympics.&quot; Nonetheless, UTA&#x27;s cost-effective light rail project merited the support of the Federal Transit Administration and would have been funded and constructed regardless of the Olympics.

TRAX became operational December 4, 1999, with an initial route of —the Blue Line, then simply dubbed the Sandy/Salt Lake Line—from Sandy to Downtown Salt Lake City. In celebration, UTA offered free rides on the new line all day, and local residents stood in long lines to be packed into the new light rail cars. The Blue Line was expanded in April 2008 to Salt Lake Central station, and as part of UTA&#x27;s FrontLines 2015 project, a three-station expansion of the line further south to Draper was completed.

Due to federal funding, the initial of the Red Line (or the University Line, as it was initially named), from downtown Salt Lake to the University of Utah, was operational by December 15, 2001—after 16 months of construction and well ahead of the original schedule. Construction was expedited to be completed before the 2002 Winter Olympics, to enable spectators to take TRAX to the opening ceremonies at Rice-Eccles Stadium. In light of heightened security in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, however, light rail service was suspended during the opening and closing ceremonies. Buses were used instead, and though also vulnerable, transported attendees without incident. An extension of further east to the University of Utah Medical Center was completed September 29, 2003, and an expansion of to South Jordan in the southwestern corner of the metropolitan area opened on August 7, 2011, with service to the Daybreak Community. At this same time TRAX lines began to be referred to by a color-coded name (rather than destinations) and the Red Line trains no longer traveled downtown, instead bypassing the city center and heading south and then southwest.

The success of TRAX led to the creation of a third line—the Green Line—which runs from the Airport station at the Salt Lake International Airport through Downtown Salt Lake City to West Valley Central station in West Valley City. This line also originally opened on August 7, 2011, and services 18 stations. The Airport extension of the Green Line, which added six new stations and provided rail service from downtown Salt Lake City to the Salt Lake International Airport for the first time, opened for service on April 14, 2013.

== &quot;FrontRunner&quot; commuter rail ==
In 2002, UTA announced a deal with Union Pacific to purchase a segment of track and right-of-way for a commuter rail line from Salt Lake City to Pleasant View, just northwest of Ogden. The new commuter train was named the &quot;FrontRunner&quot; in reference to the fact that it was intended to run up and down the Wasatch Front. Construction on the &quot;FrontRunner&quot; corridor began on August 10, 2005; seven stations opened running from Ogden to Salt Lake City on April 26, 2008. As part of the FrontLines 2015 project, the commuter rail corridor has been expanded south to Provo. Service began on the new southern extension on December 10, 2012. Future expansion may extend the corridor north to Brigham City in Box Elder County, and south to Payson and then Santaquin, with the possibility of even extending as far south as Nephi in Juab County.

In late 2020, the UTA began a virtual Open House event where citizens of Tooele were able to comment on a potential expansion of &quot;FrontRunner&quot; or bus service from Salt Lake City to Tooele County.

== The S Line ==
The S Line (formerly known as Sugar House Streetcar) is a streetcar transit line that connects Sugar House (a neighborhood of Salt Lake City) with the neighboring city of South Salt Lake, as well as the UTA TRAX system. It is a joint project between UTA, Salt Lake City, and South Salt Lake. The S-Line runs along the old Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&amp;RGW) line (which lies between 2100 South and the I-80 freeway) from the Central Pointe TRAX Station in South Salt Lake east to McClelland Street (1040 East) in Salt Lake City. The S Line line differs slightly from the TRAX lines in that it travels a slower speed, stops more often, and has &quot;stops&quot; instead of &quot;stations&quot;. It is also intended for shorter trips than TRAX, as the initial length of the entire line is only about .

Phase 1 of the S-Line opened for service on December 8, 2013. Future plans (Phase 2) include extending the line to run further north through Sugar House, but funding for the extension has not yet been secured.

In addition to the S-Line, several other areas in and around Salt Lake City are being evaluated for similar streetcar lines, but no specific projects have been announced so far.

== Rideshare ==
UTA also provides many commuting alternatives through UTA Rideshare. Many of the Rideshare options involve a combination other transportation alternatives (e.g., bicycle lockers at rail stations, bicycle racks on buses as well as the &quot;FrontRunner&quot; and TRAX trains). While many of these alternatives are provided by UTA, some are coordinated with other alternative transportation alternatives (e.g., Enterprise CarShare).

One of the most visible is the UTA Vanpool program wherein commuters carpool together and share the cost (based on total monthly mileage), while UTA provides the van, fuel, vehicle maintenance, vehicle insurance, replacement van support, and up to per month for personal use of the van. The commuters must also provide designated drivers and a bookkeeper.

Other services of Rideshare include the Ridematching Database for those seeking partners for more traditional carpooling, suggestions for other alternatives to regular commuting, and options for employers to encourage and/or subsidize many of the alternatives suggested by Rideshare.

== Change Day ==
UTA periodically adjusts its bus, TRAX, S-Line and &quot;FrontRunner&quot; schedules to meet changing ridership needs. Unless an urgent need arises, such as when a fairly major adjustment to resolve connections with the &quot;FrontRunner&quot; was made in February 2013, UTA generally limits Change Days to the middle part of April, August, and December each year. Changes can include new routes, elimination of routes, route changes, and schedule changes. Many of UTA&#x27;s seasonal bus routes (such as ski bus service) also either begin or end on Change Days.

== Area of operations ==
UTA operates in Box Elder, Davis, Salt Lake, Tooele, Utah, and Weber counties. Access extends from Brigham City in the north to Santaquin in the south. Service area includes of all cities in between, heading as far west as Grantsville in Tooele County. UTA also provides service to many of the major ski resorts along the Wasatch Front during the winter months.

=== Accessibility ===
All of UTA&#x27;s TRAX and &quot;FrontRunner&quot; trains and stations, streetcars and streetcar stops, and buses are compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act and are therefore accessible to those with disabilities. Signage at the stations, on the passenger platforms, and on the trains and streetcars clearly indicate accessibility options. Ramps on the passenger platform and assistance from the train operator may be necessary for wheelchair boarding on the Blue Line on weekdays only; these ramps are not used on weekends or on the Red or Green Lines. In accordance with the Utah Clean Air Act and UTA ordinance, smoking is prohibited on UTA property.

=== Park-&amp;-Ride ===
There are numerous free Park-&amp;-Ride lots throughout UTA&#x27;s operational area. Many are operated by UTA in conjunction with its TRAX and &quot;FrontRunner&quot; stations or other transit centers, but others are maintained by the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT). In addition, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has designated many of its meetinghouses&#x27; parking lots for use as well. Some Park &amp; Ride lots offer 24-hour parking, while others offer extended or multi-day parking.

UTA operates parking garages in conjunction with two of its stations, the Jordan Valley TRAX station in West Jordan and the Draper &quot;FrontRunner&quot; station in Draper. UTA also has a &quot;kiss-and-ride&quot; lot at the Draper &quot;FrontRunner&quot; station. The only parking provided at the Draper station is within the parking garage. There was also parking available on the nearby street before the city of Draper prohibited parking along FrontRunner Boulevard.

== Funding ==

=== UTA funding sources ===

* Local option sales tax – 70.9 percent
* Federal funding – 13.1 percent
* Fares – 11.2 percent
* Investments – 3.1 percent
* Advertising – 1.3 percent
* Other – .3 percent

=== Fares ===
UTA&#x27;s bus fares are fixed price, based on the service type, with express routes costing more. As of April 1, 2013, the basic bus and TRAX fare is US$2.50, and Paratransit is US$4 A fare on one mode of transit will usually transfer to another (&quot;e.g.&quot;, bus to TRAX, FrontRunne&quot;r&quot; to TRAX or bus, etc.). Paper and electronic transfers are issued and valid for use on other buses, TRAX and the S-Line. Fares on &quot;FrontRunner&quot; are distance-based and can be transferred to TRAX or bus, but TRAX or bus fare cannot be transferred to &quot;FrontRunner&quot; without purchase of an upgrade. Exemptions apply to kids below 6, who ride free with fare-paying rider, up to 3.

Numerous fare products and a variety of discounts and discount passes are available for eligible riders. These include all day and monthly passes purchased at local stores; passes for college students, minors, and seniors; Group Passes; and employer-sponsored passes. Ticket machines at all &quot;FrontRunner&quot;, MAX, TRAX and S-Line stations accept cash and major debit and credit cards. While ticket machines provide change for cash purchases, cash paying riders must have the exact fare amount upon boarding buses, as change is not available.

In 2009, UTA launched an automated fare collection system (ARC) to collect fares with contactless smart cards. As the first full AFC system in the United States to accept contactless bank cards, the UTA system, implemented in conjunction with Vix Technology, received the 2009 Innovation Award from the American Public Transportation Association and the 2009 Sesames Transportation Award.

UTA is now offering a prepaid fare card called FAREPAY. FAREPAY cards can be used to quickly pay fares on any UTA operated transportation (except paratransit). The cards can be purchased online or a UTA customer service center, as well as select retailers. The cards have a one-time US$3 activation fee, but can then be loaded (or reloaded) with as little as US$5 or as much as US$500. Reloading of cards may also be done online or at a UTA customer service center, as well as the same select retailers that sell the cards. Riders who pay with FAREPAY receive 40 percent off bus fare, 20 percent off TRAX and S-Line fare and up to 20 percent off &quot;FrontRunner&quot; fare. This promotion has been extended until December 31, 2017.

UTA currently has a Free Fare Zone in downtown Salt Lake City which allows transportation patrons that both enter and exit bus or TRAX service within the zone to ride at no charge. The zone was originally created in 1985 and covers an area of approximately 36 city blocks. The boundaries are roughly North Temple, 200 East, 500 South and 400 West. TRAX stations within the zone include Arena, City Center, Courthouse, Gallivan Plaza, Planetarium, and Temple Square. In addition, the Free Fare Zone also includes the area of the State Capitol (north to 500 North), the bus stops on 400 South between 200 East and 300 East, and three additional TRAX stations: Library, Old GreekTown, and Salt Lake Central. In June 2012 UTA revealed plans to eliminate the Free Fare Zone, but by September 2012 it announced that it would continue the zone, but with some minor adjustments, including when and how fares are collected for service ending outside the zone.

UTA has been criticized for having some of the highest fares in the transportation industry. In 2011 UTA raised fares as part of a change in the way it handled fuel surcharges. &quot;A recent analysis by The Salt Lake Tribune shows that the UTA already had among the highest bus and train fares in the nation before the new fare hike. Its current total fare of US$2.25 was tied for fifth-highest among 193 transit systems nationally that responded to an American Public Transportation Association survey completed last August.&quot;

UTA fares have not increased since 2013. In 2016, UTA published information showing that the US$2.50 cash fare is comparable to other mid-sized agencies. When the US$1.50 FAREPAY fare is taken into consideration, the fare is lower than many other similar public transit agencies.

== Leadership and operation ==

UTA is governed by a 3-member Board of Trustees that continually directs agency staff to improve public transit along the Wasatch Front. Trustees are appointed by the city and county governments that fund UTA with a local option sales taxes. Board members work with their appointing local representatives to direct UTA so the agency can best meet the needs of individual communities.

Local elected officials may serve on the UTA Board, and one seat is reserved for a member of the Utah Transportation Commission, which is part of the Utah Department of Transportation. The President of the Senate, Speaker of the House, and Governor of the State of Utah each appoint one seat as well.

In July 2013, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced that for the year 2012 UTA had earned the &quot;Gold Standard&quot;, TSA&#x27;s highest security rating. TSA also reported that UTA was among only fifteen other mass transit agencies to have earned this rating for the same period.

Higher salaries of executives has been an issue. In 2015, UTA executives opted out of receiving an increase in their compensation and also refused to receive any of their usual annual bonuses for the 2015 and 2016 annual periods. UTA also revised its compensation policy on May 19, 2015, to bring those who are earning less than those in similar job functions at other transit organizations in line with the industry standards.

In 2016, the newly appointed CEO Jerry Benson announced that two of the executive positions were being removed and the departments under those previous executives responsibilities would be absorbed under the remaining members of the executive team.

CEO Jerry Benson was terminated effective May 7, 2018, following the passing of Utah SB 136.

UTA&#x27;s current executive director is Jay Fox. In 2022, his salary was reported to be $247,918—415 percent higher than the average Utah Transit Authority employee’s salary, which was reported to be $48,163.
=== Police department ===

UTA also operates a law enforcement arm, the Utah Transit Authority Police Department. The department conducts law enforcement services, criminal investigations and public safety throughout bus transit, commuter rail, and light rail systems.

== FrontLines 2015 ==
The purpose of the FrontLines 2015 project was to meet the increasing transportation needs of the Wasatch Front&#x27;s growing population. It consisted of expansions to both TRAX and &quot;FrontRunner&quot; and was the largest expansion in UTA&#x27;s history. UTA relied heavily on sales tax revenues to fund this project. On December 10, 2012, the &quot;FrontRunner&quot; South extension opened for service and extended the previous line south from Salt Lake City to Provo. This new expansion allows commuters to travel from Provo to Salt Lake City in less than one hour. &quot;FrontRunner&quot; South was an extension of the previous line, which ran north from Downtown Salt Lake City to Pleasant View in north Weber County. FrontLines 2015 added/expanded four extensions in the TRAX system including the Mid-Jordan extension, the West Valley City extension, the airport extension, and the Draper extension. While all the projects were set to be completed by the year 2015, all of them were completed well ahead of schedule. The mid-Jordan TRAX and West Valley extensions both opened August 7, 2011, and the airport extension opened April 14, 2013, followed by the Draper extension on August 18, 2013. Just prior to the opening of the Draper extension in August 2013, UTA announced that the FrontLines 2015 project had been completed under budget and years ahead of schedule.

<text>Peter John Arundell (8 November 1933 – 16 June 2009) was a British racing driver from England, who raced in Formula One for Team Lotus. He participated in 13 World Championship Grands Prix, scoring 12 championship points.

Born in Ilford, Essex, Arundell became a professional racing driver after finishing his time in the Royal Air Force, competing in Elva and Lotus cars. He won an early Formula Junior race held in England, the John Davy Trophy at the Boxing Day Brands Hatch meeting in an Elva-D.K.W. in 1959. In 1962 he won the British Formula Junior championship in a Lotus 22, and also in 1963 in a Lotus 27. He also won the Monaco Formula Junior race in 1961 and 1962. He won the last Formula Junior race held in England, the Anglo-European Formula Junior Trophy, also at Brands Hatch, in September 1963, in a Lotus 27-Ford.

He marked his arrival in the Formula One World Championship in 1964 with two podium finishes. He was regarded as a strong prospect for the future and a great supporting driver for World Champion Jim Clark.

In 1964, while racing in Formula Two at Reims-Gueux, he had a spin and was hit at high speed by Richie Ginther; Arundell was thrown from the car in the impact, which resulted in him missing most of the 1965 season. Lotus boss Colin Chapman saved his place in the team for 1966, with Arundell finishing third on his comeback in the non-championship South African Grand Prix at East London on 1 January 1966. He did not enjoy any great success and at the end of that year he retired from Formula One, having started only 11 races.

He retired from racing altogether in 1969, and later moved to Florida, where he set up a software company.

<doc id="1235868" wikidata="Q173049" url="?curid=1235868" title="Peter Whitehead (racing driver)">
<text>Peter Nield Whitehead (12 November 1914 – 21 September 1958) was a British racing driver. He was born in Menston, Yorkshire and was killed in an accident at Lasalle, France, during the Tour de France endurance race. A cultured, knowledgeable and well-travelled racer, he was excellent in sports cars. He won the 1938 Australian Grand Prix, which along with a 24 Heures du Mans win in 1951, probably was his finest achievement, but he also won two 12 Heures internationales de Reims events. He was a regular entrant, mostly for Peter Walker and Graham Whitehead, his half-brother. His death in 1958 ended a career that started in 1935 – however, he was lucky to survive an air crash in 1948.

==Early life and pre-war racing==

Yorkshireman Whitehead, coming from a wealthy background, gained from the wool industry, started racing in a Riley when he was 19. He moved up to an ERA B-Type the following season and then scored the first major result for the Alta, when he finished third in the Limerick Grand Prix, a Formula Libre race. In 1936, he shared his ERA with Peter Walker, and finished third in the Donington Grand Prix. He took the ERA to Australia in 1938 while touring on business, where he scored his first major victory, winning the 1938 Australian Grand Prix at Bathurst, as well as the inaugural Australian Hillclimb Championship. He returned in England in 1939 and gained a third place in the Nuffield Trophy.

==Post-war racing career==

During World War II, Whitehead was a pilot with the Royal Air Force, and he was back in competition as soon as racing was revived, taking his trusty ERA to second place in the British Empire Trophy, held at the Douglas Circuit on the Isle of Man in the summer of 1947. He also raced in the Lausanne Grand Prix, finishing sixth.

In 1948, he survived a plane crash at Croydon Aerodrome, when he was on his way to Milano, to arrange the purchase a Ferrari 125. The accident left him badly hurt and out of racing for a year.

===Grand Prix racer===

Peter Whitehead and his good friend and co driver Dudley Folland are notable as being the first people to whom Enzo Ferrari ever sold a Formula One car: a Ferrari 125 in 1949. Dudley Folland had the car painted green, with a red Welsh Dragon painted on the bonnet, being a proud Welshman.

Peter won the Velká cena Československa. In doing so, he became the first Englishman to win a major international motor race outside of the United Kingdom since Richard Seaman. The following season, Whitehead made his debut in the Drivers&#x27; World Championship at Monaco, but did not start. His next outing in the championship came in the Grand Prix l’A.C.F., where he came close to winning but was slowed with a gearbox problem which he dropped to third. That was to be his only podium finished in 11 championship starts between 1950 and 1954.
During 1950 season, he won two minor Formula One races, the Jersey Road Race and the Ulster Trophy, but the biggest career victory came in Sports Cars. He continued to race and win in Formula Two across Europe. Later, he added victories in the 1954 Lady Wigram Trophy, in New Zealand, and repeated the feat in 1956 and 1957. He also won the 1956 Rand Grand Prix. All four of those victories, he was driving a Ferrari.

===Sports car racing===

1950 saw Whitehead start his first 24 Hours of Le Mans race, together with John Marshall in a Jaguar XK120. The pair finished in 15th place. He teamed up with Peter Walker to win the 1951 race, however, in a Jaguar C-Type, at an average speed of .

In 1953, Whitehead decided to concentrate on sports cars, and in July, he saw more success sharing a Jaguar C-Type with Stirling Moss in the 12 Heures Internationales de Reims. He returned again in 1954, in a full works supported Jaguar D-Type to win the event again partnered by Ken Wharton. Prior to that first win at Reims, he also won the Hyères 12 Hours.

Later in 1954, again paired with Wharton, he was placed sixth in the RAC Tourist Trophy road race.

==Death==

Whitehead&#x27;s last great performance was at Le Mans in 1958 where he came second in an Aston Martin DB3S, sharing the driving with his half-brother, Graham. A couple of months later, on 21 September 1958, Peter and Graham were competing together in the Tour de France, when their Jaguar 3.4-Litre crashed off a bridge into a ravine at Lasalle, near Nîmes after overturning twice, with Graham at the wheel. Graham escaped with serious but not life-threatening injuries, but Peter was killed instantly.

<text>Piero Taruffi (12 October 1906 – 12 January 1988) was an Italian racing driver, motorcycle road racer, motorsport executive and engineer, who competed in Formula One from to . Taruffi won the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix with Ferrari. In endurance racing, Taruffi won the Mille Miglia in 1957, also with Ferrari. In Grand Prix motorcycle racing, Taruffi won the 1932 European Championship in the premier 500cc class with Norton.

Born and raised in Rome, Taruffi started his career in motorcycle racing, winning the 500cc European Championship in 1932 with Norton. He also held the motorcycle land-speed record for 38 days in 1937, reaching a speed of 274.18 km/h on the Autostrada Serenissima whilst riding a 492cc Gilera. Taruffi competed in Formula One for Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes, Maserati and Vanwall, winning the in with Ferrari and finishing third in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship that season.

Outside of Formula One, Taruffi competed extensively in sportscar racing, winning the final edition of the Mille Miglia with Ferrari, driving the 315 S and retiring upon his victory. He also managed the Gilera motorcycle team throughout his career, designing the record-breaking Cisitalia &quot;Tarf&quot; and Gilera &quot;Rondine&quot;.

==Motorcycle racing career==

Taruffi began his motorsport career racing motorcycles. He won the 1932 500cc European Championship on a Norton and in 1937 set the motorcycle land speed record at 279.503 km/h (173.68 mph).

==Sportscar racing career==
Taruffi drove a newly introduced 2-litre, 4-cylinder Ferrari in the 1951 Bari Grand Prix, finishing third behind Juan Manuel Fangio and Froilán González. He completed the 360 km race with a time of 2 hours 58 minutes 40 3/5 seconds. In November 1951 Taruffi participated in the Carrera Panamericana in Mexico. He finished first in the opening leg from Mexico City to León, Guanajuato, a leg. Taruffi led second-placed Troy Ruttman by more than four minutes. Taruffi trimmed a further 15 minutes on the Mexico City-Leon leg and another 21 minutes between Leon and Durango. In the process he climbed from 12th to third overall. Taruffi and Luigi Chinetti eventually won the race on 25 November, with a time of 21:57:52. His average speed was 87.6 mph (140.97 km/h).

Taruffi set a world record for in an auto of 22 cubic centimetre (1.3 in3) displacement in January 1952. He attempted a record but his motor failed after . Taruffi was in a two-litre Ferrari for the running of the third Grand Prix de France, in Paris in May 1952. He captured first place with a time of three hours over a distance of . His average speed was . Taruffi placed second to Fangio in the 1953 Carrera Panamericana, with a time of 18:18:51 in a Lancia D24. His time was better than the previous year when he was victorious. In March 1954, Taruffi lost the 12 hours of Sebring with an hour to go, after having led the first three hours, when his Lancia stopped. He pushed it to the pits and team mechanics began working on it with diligence. Taruffi was still out of the car when the O.S.C.A. shared by Stirling Moss and Bill Lloyd crossed the finish line. Taruffi had averaged before he retired. Taruffi won the Giro di Sicilia in April 1954. His time of 10 hours 24 minutes 37 seconds established a record for an event which opened Italy&#x27;s sports car racing season. It was 14 years old at the time. He averaged in a Lancia D24.

Taruffi and Harry Schell placed fifth overall at Sebring in 1955 , driving a Ferrari 750 Monza. Taruffi claimed first place in a Ferrari, at the 1955 Tour of Sicily, with an overall time of 10 hours 11 minutes 19.4 seconds, with an average speed of . Taruffi dropped out of the 1955 Mille Miglia, when he suffered a broken oil pump on the course north of Rome. He and eventual winner, Stirling Moss, were vying for the lead in the early stages of the race. Cesare Perdisa won by 22 seconds in the 1955 Grand Prix of Imola, driving a two-litre Maserati. Taruffi spun his car into a straw bale at the edge of the track on the first lap. He was uninjured, though his car was damaged, and he was forced to retire from the race. Jean Behra and Taruffi teamed to secure a fifth-place finish in a Maserati at the 1956 Sebring 12 hours. Taruffi established a world record for Class E cars in June 1956. He raced in 46 minutes 27.2 seconds, an average of 129.9 miles per hour (209.04 km/h). Also at Monza, Taruffi broke the one-hour mark of 212.543 kilometres per hour (132.074 mph). A third record he performed was for 200 kilometres. His time was 53 minutes 14.5 seconds. In the 17th running of the Tour of Sicily, in 1957, Taruffi had a small crash while in pursuit of leader Olivier Gendebien. He touched the wall in Gioiosa Marea but continued in his Maserati. Gendebien won in a Ferrari. During the event, J. Olivari was burned to death when his Maserati hit a wall on the course.
Taruffi&#x27;s last victory was at the 1957 Mille Miglia, the last competitive edition of the Italian race, where he won in a Ferrari 315 S. At the race, Alfonso de Portago suffered a tire failure and crashed his car into the crowd, killing himself, his co-driver Edmund Nelson, and nine spectators. Following this, Taruffi officially retired from competitive racing. He was 50 years of age.

==Formula One career==
Taruffi participated in 18 World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 3 September 1950. Taruffi drove a Ferrari to victory in the May 1952 Swiss Grand Prix. He led from the start, with the Ferrari of Rudolf Fischer coming in second. Over the course of six seasons he scored a total of 41 championship points. He also participated in numerous non-championship Formula One races. His best season was 1952 where he finished third behind Giuseppe Farina and World Champion Alberto Ascari.

==Stockcar racing career==
Taruffi drove a Ford stock car owned by Floyd Clymer of Los Angeles in the Pan-American race held in November 1954.

==Other Ventures==
In 1959 Taruffi authored the book &quot;The Technique of Motor Racing&quot;. In November 1957 the Saturday Evening Post published Taruffi&#x27;s article, &quot;Stop us before we kill again&quot;, where he discussed the 1955 Le Mans and 1957 Mille Miglia races where drivers and numerous spectators lost their lives.

In August 1952 Taruffi designed and patented a racing car with the entry 2,608, 264. The car featured three torpedo-shaped parallel bodies joined together. Independent twin motors and wheels were in the two larger bodies, at left and right. The driver and the passengers sit in the car&#x27;s central part. The central portion is both higher and smaller than the others. Taruffi commented on the low wind resistance and low centre of gravity of his design. Taruffi died in Rome in 1988, age 81.

==Legacy==
The Piero Taruffi Museum is located in Bagnoregio, a small town between Viterbo and Orvieto in Central Italy. The museum collection includes a selection of vintage cars and motorbikes from Taruffi&#x27;s racing career.

In the 2023 biographical sports drama film &quot;Ferrari,&quot; Taruffi is portrayed by American actor Patrick Dempsey.

<doc id="1235870" wikidata="Q172057" url="?curid=1235870" title="Reg Parnell">
<text>Reginald Parnell (2 July 1911 – 7 January 1964) was a racing driver and team manager from Derby, England. He participated in seven Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, achieving one podium, and scoring a total of nine championship points.

Parnell, as both a driver and a team manager, had a considerable influence on post-war British motorsport until his premature death in 1964. Parnell raced at Brooklands and was banned following an accident with Kay Petre which ended her racing career. Before the war he bought up racing cars. Once the hostilities had ceased he sold them to form the basis of post-war racing entries. He later raced a whole host of cars before turning to management and taking Aston Martin into Formula 1. Parnell went on to run the Yeoman Credit Racing team with the help of his son Tim who later raced in Formula 1 himself.

==Early career==

Parnell came from a family which ran a garage business in Derby. In 1933, he was a spectator when Donington Park held its first motor race, and he decided to try the sport. By 1935, he bought an old 2-litre Bugatti single-seater for just £25. It broke its rear axle in the paddock at its first meeting, but buying spare parts for the Bugatti was too expensive, so it was replaced with a MG Magnette K3. Parnell had secured wins at both Brooklands and Donington Park, but in 1937 he lost his licence following a practice accident for the 500 Mile race, at Brooklands. He misjudged an overtaking move on Kay Petre, when he lost control of the MG, crashing into her Austin 7 from behind, causing it to roll. She crashed badly and was seriously injured. She never raced competitively again. Although she put the incident down to &quot;bad luck&quot;, the RAC revoked Parnell&#x27;s racing license for two years. This meant that he was unable to race.

The ban meant in effect that, during 1938, Parnell found himself unable to race his cars, he soon discovered that lending the cars to other drivers was an excellent way of being involved in racing. His later abilities as a team manager were probably developed during this period. With his licence restored in 1939, Parnell was back with 4.9-litre Bugatti-engined single-seater, known as the BHW. He was particularly successful with this BHW at Donington Park. Meanwhile, he started to construct his own car for voiturette (the pre-war version of Formula Two), known as the Challenger, however with the outbreak of World War II, the best years of his career were wasted.

During the war years, Parnell finished the Challenger and built up a comprehensive collection of racing machinery, which included Alfa Romeo, ERA, Riley, Delage, MG and Maserati models. He also sold race cars, with many famous and less famous racing machines passing through his hands, whilst making a name for himself in the business. This did not prevent Parnell from driving as soon as the war ended.

==Post WWII==

He returned to racing as soon as he could in 1946 in a variety of machinery, most notably a Maserati 4CLT, then an ERA A-type alongside several Delages and Rileys. As for the Challenger, it was sold. This proved to be a poor year for mechanical reliability, although in his Maserati 4CLM, he did finish second behind Prince Bira in the Ulster Trophy, around the streets of Dundrod. There was only one motor racing event held on English soil in 1946, and this took place at Gransden Lodge, with Parnell winning the main race of the event, the Gransden Lodge Trophy.
In 1947, Parnell was Britain&#x27;s most successful racing driver, for which he won the BRDC&#x27;s Gold Star. He began the year by winning two ice races in Sweden, with his ERA A-type, the earlier of these being the first Formula 1 race. He then returned to Britain, to win the Jersey Road Race in the Maserati 4CLT. He would have also won in Ulster, had his recently acquired ERA E-type not broken a de Dion tube. The following year, Parnell would again win the Gold Star. He took his new Maserati 4CLT/48 to Zandvoort and finished third in the circuit&#x27;s inaugural meeting. He won the Goodwood Trophy at the first-ever meeting at Sussex circuit, was second in the Penya Rhin Grand Prix and fifth in the Gran Premio d&#x27;Italia. Parnell maintained this success into 1949 with the Maserati, gaining many successes at Goodwood, earning him the nickname, &quot;Emperor of Goodwood&quot;, and raced at almost every major circuit across Europe. He also competed in the early-season races in South America.

It was in Sweden that Parnell showed true British ingenuity. He was there for the 1947 Swedish Winter Grand Prix at Rommehed, the first race run for cars complying with the newly-introduced Formula 1. He duly won, thus becoming the first winner of a Formula 1 race. He led an ERA clean sweep of the podium, as the only three cars to finish. Their chief rivals – the French – were stranded miles away from the circuit, on a ship stuck fast in the ice. The organiser decided to rerun the event as the Stockholm Grand Prix, on Lake Vallentuna. Meanwhile, between the two races Parnell had the idea of fitting twin rear wheels to his ERA to improve its road-holding on the ice. When he arrived at the race, the lead French driver, Raymond Sommer immediately objected but Parnell had checked the rules beforehand and found that there was nothing to preclude twin rear wheels. Despite temperatures of −15°F, Parnell&#x27;s extra wheels really made the difference, as he skated to victory.

==Formula One==

The following season, he received a tremendous accolade, he was asked to drive the fourth works Alfa Romeo, in the inaugural World Championship Formula One race at Silverstone, finishing in an excellent third place and a place on the podium, behind and on the same lap as his teammates Giuseppe Farina and Luigi Fagioli. He would be the only British driver even to be selected to race with the all-conquering factory.

Whilst racing his Maserati, under the Scuderia Ambrosiana banner, he then became involved with BRM, initially as a test driver of the original V16 and later as the team&#x27;s lead driver of the BRM Type 15, although BRM did not make many appearances. He remained under contract to BRM for 1951, but raced his Maserati because BRM could never get him a car, first with a win in the Chichester Cup at Goodwood, then having to retire in the Gran Premio di San Remo. When the BRM did work, it was at Goodwood that the car had its first victories when Parnell won the Woodcote Cup, then the Goodwood Trophy later the same day.
After the trip in Italy, Tony Vandervell approached him which saw Parnell driving Vandervell&#x27;s Thinwall Special (a highly modified Formula One Ferrari 375) in numerous F1 races. He left a star-studded field standing in conditions so bad that the BRDC International Trophy final raced through hail, lightning and heavy rain. With poor visibility and the track under as much as six inches of water, the race had to be stopped after six laps due to Silverstone being flooded and too dangerous to continue. When the race was abandoned, Parnell was in the lead; no official winner was declared, so although he defeated the Alfa Romeo team, it was not until two months later in the 1951 British Grand Prix that the Alfas suffered their first real defeat. After the race Reg said, &quot;It&#x27;s a pity it was stopped as I would have liked the race to have continued. I was a minute ahead of the Italians and I am sure they would not have made this up. It was like aquaplaning in an ice-cold tub, but in the cockpit it was very hot and steamy so that at 80mph I only had a dim outline of the comers and only the outlines of spray telling me that another car was in front.&quot;

Vandervell immediately entered Parnell for the Festival of Britain Trophy at Goodwood, just a few weeks later. Parnell won the first heat, breaking the outright lap record on his first lap, from a standing start, from Farina and his 4CLT. He would go on and win the final, after a tremendous battle with Farina.

Parnell was back in the 4CLT at Dundrod for the Ulster Trophy. Following his defeat at Goodwood, Farina arrived with a works Alfa Romeo 158. At the start, the Italian had the better start and took the lead with Parnell running second. This was a tactical move, as the Farina knew that he would have to stop for fuel, whereas Parnell could run the race without stopping. As Farina exited the pits, Parnell shot past into the lead, but just one lap later, the Farina ate up Parnell&#x27;s 3-second lead, passed him and won the race with Parnell taking second.

At the Grand Prix de l&#x27;A.C.F., BRM announced they would race at Reims-Gueux with Parnell, so Vandervell offered the Thinwall Special to Brian Shawe-Taylor. However, as the BRM failed to show up, and Shawe-Taylor was clearly at the same level as Parnell, Vandervell offered the Thinwall to Parnell, who finished fourth. After finishing second at Goodwood, he ended his season by taking the Scottish Grand Prix, at Winfield.

June 1952, over 25,000 spectators squeezed into Boreham to see Parnell take his only Formula Two victory aboard a Cooper –Bristol T20.

==Sportscars==
Following his success into the 1950 RAC British Grand Prix, Parnell was signed by Aston Martin, taking a DB2 to sixth place in to 24 Heures du Mans, partnered by Charles Brackenbury (second in class). He followed this up with a class win (fourth overall) in the RAC Tourist Trophy, held around the narrow lanes of Dundrod.

In 1952, Parnell enjoyed more class success with the DB2, taking wins at Silverstone and Boreham; at Goodwood, he unhesitatingly assumed duties as team manager for Aston Martin, following a pit fire seriously injured John Wyer. This was a foretaste of things to come. The success continued into 1953. At that year&#x27;s Mille Miglia despite driving on the ignition switch after a broken throttle had to be wired up fully open, he and navigator, Louis Klemantaski finished in fifth place in their DB3. This was the highest ever finish by a British car at the great Italian classic. This result followed his second place in the 12 Hours of Sebring. He was also second at the RAC Tourist Trophy, and victorious in the Goodwood Nine Hours.

==Later years==

In 1954, in addition to his commitments for Aston Martin, Parnell continued to drive his own Ferrari 625 in numerous Formula One events, winning at Goodwood, Snetterton and Crystal Palace. The following season, he secured more victories for Aston Martin, before an unsuccessful sortie to New Zealand with an experimental single-seater Aston Martin. During 1956 Whit Monday at Crystal Palace, Parnell crashed Rob Walker&#x27;s Connaught B-type, suffering a broken collar-bone and a badly cut knee. He recovered from this and returned to New Zealand, with the Scudeia Ambrosiana entered Ferrari 555/860, winning both the New Zealand Grand Prix and the Dunedin Trophy, early 1957.

He was successful in other formulae but at the end of 1957 he decided to retire at the age of just 45. His last international race was the New Zealand Championship Road Race, at Ryal Bush where he finished second in a Ferrari 555/860.

==Team management==

He became the team manager of Aston Martin, a move which led him to oversee a famous 1–2 in 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans, when Roy Salvadori and Carroll Shelby led home Maurice Trintignant and Paul Frère. The company then decided to enter Formula One and Parnell led the team but at the end of 1960 the programme was abandoned.

In 1961 the Samengo-Turner brothers (Paul, William &amp; Fabian) asked Parnell to take over the management of the Yeoman Credit Racing Team sponsorship deal from Ken Gregory of the British Racing Partnership. During the 1961 Formula One season, he ran two Cooper T53 Low-Line–Climax cars for John Surtees and Roy Salvadori, who between them collected a handful of championship points. For the 1962 season the team was renamed Bowmaker-Yeoman Racing, and in place of the Coopers, ran Lola Mk4 chassis, again powered by Climax engines. Surtees and Salvadori remained with the team, but Salvadori had a nightmare season, failing to finish a single race. Surtees fared much better, however, scoring 19 points and finishing in fourth place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. During the season he also gave Parnell his first podium finishes as manager – with second places in both the British and German events – and took pole position at the season-opening Dutch Grand Prix.

After the Bowmakers withdrew from F1 at the end of 1962, Parnell set up a team in his own name. Reg Parnell Racing was still in the early stages of development in its premises in Hounslow, running a car of the young driver, Chris Amon.

Dr. Bartrip wrote that Parnell &quot;could prepare a car meticulously and was as astute judge of a driver, identifying the potential of such talented prospects as John Surtees, Chris Amon, and Mike Hailwood&quot;.

==Death==

For the 1964 season, Parnell had commissioned a design for a new car, when he died from peritonitis at age 52 from complications after an appendix operation. Parnell&#x27;s son Tim, also a racing driver, took over the team management and developed a strong working relationship with BRM during the late 1960s.

==Career==
Wisell won the Swedish Formula Three Championship in 1967. 

In 1970 he entered Formula One with Team Lotus as a late-season replacement for John Miles, who had departed after team leader Jochen Rindt had been killed at Monza on 5 September. Wisell’s debut was in October at the 1970 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen. The race was the best result of his Formula One career with a third-place finish, trailing only his teammate and future champion Emerson Fittipaldi and Pedro Rodríguez and finishing ahead of title contender Jacky Ickx. Subsequent races for Team Lotus were less successful and he was dropped by the team at the end of the 1971 season. He continued to compete in Formula One with BRM and March. He also participated in several non-Championship Formula One races. Wisell retired in 1974 after his home Grand Prix.

<doc id="1235872" wikidata="Q2924760" url="?curid=1235872" title="A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies">
<text>A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies () is an account written by the Spanish Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas in 1542 (published in 1552) about the mistreatment of and atrocities committed against the indigenous peoples of the Americas in colonial times and sent to then Prince Philip II of Spain.

== Background ==
Bartolomé de las Casas explains in the prologue that his fifty years of experience in Spanish colonies in the Indies granted him both moral legitimacy and accountability for writing this account. In 1516, Las Casas was granted the title of Protector of the Indians by Cardinal Cisneros after he submitted a report on their population decline due to harsh labor and mistreatment by colonial officials. During the time when Las Casas served as the Protector of the Indians, several clerics from the Order of Saint Jerome attempted to reform systems which used the native populace as laborers. However, Las Casas found their attempts insufficient to protect the welfare of the Indians, and returned to Spain to appeal to the Spanish monarch in 1517.

From 1517 to 1540, Las Casas traveled back and forth between Spain and Spanish colonies in Latin America numerous times, struggling to find a common ground between Spanish authorities and his own attempts to improve the conditions of Indian subjects in Spanish dominions. One of the purposes of his travels was to continue to protest Spanish colonial mistreatment of Indians.

In 1542, after Las Casas first wrote the chronicle later known as &quot;A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies&quot;, during the hearings ordered by Charles V of Spain to resolve issues of forceful conversion and colonial exploitation of Indians, Las Casas presented the account before the members of the Council of the Indies as proof of atrocities committed upon Indians by colonial authorities.

== Contents ==
It was written for Prince Philip II of Spain. Las Casas appeals to the Prince&#x27;s pathos throughout his account. One of the stated purposes for writing the account is his fear of Spain coming under divine punishment, and his concern for the souls of the Native peoples. The account is one of the first attempts by a Spanish writer of the colonial era to depict examples of unfair treatment that indigenous people endured in the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Greater Antilles, particularly the island of Hispaniola. De las Casas noticed that no matter where he visited, the Spanish were committing the same crimes. On the island of Hispaniola, the Spanish were herding people into a straw building and setting fire to it, burning the occupants alive. In addition, &quot;they sent the Males to the Mines to dig and bring away the Gold, which is an intolerable labor; but the Women they made use of to Manure and Till the ground, which is a toil most irksome even to Men of the strongest and most robust constitutions, allowing them no other food but Herbage, and such kind of unsubstantial nutriment, so that the Nursing Women&#x27;s Milk was exsiccated and so dryed up, that the young Infants lately brought forth, all perished.&quot; On Puerto Rico and Jamaica, he saw the Spanish, &quot;with the same purpose and design they proposed to themselves in the Isle of Hispaniola, perpetrating innumerable Robberies and Villanies as before,&quot; and that &quot;These two Isles containing six hundred thousand at least, though at this day there are scarce two hundred men to be found in either of them.&quot; De las Casas also notes that what the Spanish were doing drove many natives to commit suicide. On Cuba, &quot;By the ferocity of one Spanish Tyrant (whom I knew) above Two Hundred Indians hang&#x27;d themselves of their own accord; and a multitude of People perished by this kind of Death&quot; and &quot;Six Thousand Children and upward were murder&#x27;d, because they had lost their Parents who labour&#x27;d in the Mines.&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies&quot; marks a significant moment in the way 21st century colonial Latin American historians would address world history. By comparing what historians know today about colonial Latin America, with the descriptions and recommendations given by De Las Casas in &quot;A Short Account&quot;, they are able to understand more about Europeans biases, prejudices, and outlook on the colonization of the Americas. De Las Casas&#x27; &quot;A Short Account&quot; was a revised history of the conquest, in the way that he includes facts that would aid him in his argument. Political scientist Diego von Vacano argued De Las Casas&#x27; &quot;A Short Account&quot;, revealed the ways 16th century scholars used rhetoric to lobby for changes during the Spanish colonization of the Americas. In his earlier writings De Las Casas advocated the defense of indigenous peoples by recommending the use of African slaves as an alternative to indigenous people, but later repudiated the suggestion and condemned both the enslavement of indigenous people and Africans.

De Las Casas used the term &quot;New World&quot; to look at the Americas and Western hemisphere and did not use the term or idea of the &quot;ancient world&quot; as a way to describe Spain, Europe and the Eastern hemisphere. This linguistic shift marked a transition in historical text and thought by moving away from the medieval view of geography and world history to a more modern view. De Las Casas addressed the new population in the Americas and introduced it in a political way in addressing the Spanish King. De Las Casas introduced and presented the people of the Americas in the context of the Spanish empire.

De Las Casas is also noted as one of the first writers and thinkers to racialize the indigenous people of the Americas. In his attempt to defend the indigenous people, he argues that they are part of the human race by describing their bodies, skin color, language and culture. In &quot;A Short Account&quot;, De Las Casas racialized the indigenous people and created a new understanding for them in the context and hierarchy of European ideas of race.

His account was responsible for the passage of the new Spanish colonial laws known as the New Laws of 1542, which abolished native slavery for the first time in European colonial history and led to the Valladolid debate. This text was used as a way to convince the King of Spain of the cruelties caused by the Spanish Conquistadors. As such, he did not focus on or mention the effects of disease as a cause of suffering for the native people. Instead, De Las Casas focused on the suffering caused by the Spanish conquistadors so that the King would address the conquistadors&#x27; behavior.

The account was republished in 1620, by Jan Evertszoon Cloppenburch, alongside the book &quot;Origin and progress of the disturbances in the Netherlands&quot; by Dutch historian Johannes Gysius. The book was frequently reprinted, alone or in combination with other works, in the Netherlands and in other countries struggling against the power of Spain in Europe and the Americas. The title in English, German, Dutch, and most languages, was manipulated to farther insist on the detrimental consequences of the Spanish conquest. The images described by Las Casas were later depicted by Theodor de Bry in copper plate engravings that contributed to the Spanish Black Legend.

== Rhetorical strategy ==
&quot;A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies&quot; has been acclaimed by scholars for its rhetorical effect. De Las Casas juxtaposes the inhumane mistreatment of the Spanish conquistadors with the inherent goodness of the indigenous people in an exaggerated manner in his strategy of persuasion. De Las Casas revised and re-edited this book in order to make his best argument in favor of the indigenous people.

<text>Richard James David&quot;Dickie&quot;Attwood (born 4 April 1940) is a British motor racing driver from England. During his career he raced for the BRM, Lotus and Cooper Formula One teams. He competed in 17 World Championship Grands Prix, achieved one podium and scored a total of 11 championship points. He was also a successful sports car racing driver and won the 1970 24 Hours of Le Mans race, driving a Porsche 917, the first of Porsche&#x27;s record 19 victories at the famous race.

==Early career==
Richard Attwood got into the motor industry as an apprentice at sports car manufacturer Jaguar. He started racing in 1960 at the wheel of a Triumph TR3. For 1961 he joined the Midlands Racing Partnership to drive for them in club-level Formula Junior events, and continued in this role until the end of 1962. In 1963 the team expanded into the international arena, and Attwood immediately grabbed motorsport headlines when he won the Monaco Grand Prix Formula Junior support race, in a Lola Mk5a. This and other performances during the year earned him the inaugural Grovewood Award, voted for by a Guild of Motoring Writers panel.

On the back of this success, in 1964 MRP decided to step up to the Formula Two class. Attwood won in Vienna and took second places in the Pau Grand Prix, Eifelrennen, and Albi Grand Prix. This was at a time when top-line Grand Prix drivers were an integral part of the Formula Two series; indeed, at Pau he was only beaten by reigning Formula One World Champion Jim Clark driving a full-works Lotus.

==Formula One and other single-seat series==
Attwood&#x27;s performances in Formula Two prompted Alfred Owen, the proprietor of BRM, to offer him an opportunity in his works Formula One team. His first outing for the team was in the non-Championship News of the World Trophy race, at Goodwood, in which he took the BRM P57 to fourth place, the first non-Lotus finisher and the only car to end on the same lap as Colin Chapman&#x27;s fleet winners. Attwood&#x27;s second Formula One outing was in the 1964 British Grand Prix, driving BRM&#x27;s experimental four wheel drive P67 model. Having been the project&#x27;s test driver Attwood did manage to qualify the overweight car, albeit in last place on the grid. However, as the car was principally intended as a rolling test bed, BRM decided to withdraw the P67 prior to the race itself.
Tim Parnell signed Attwood to his privateer Reg Parnell Racing team for , driving a formerly class-leading Lotus 25. Unfortunately for Attwood, by 1965 the chassis was past its best, and fitted with the BRM motor it was distinctly uncompetitive. Although generally reliable, Attwood only managed to pick up a pair of sixth-place points finishes towards the end of the season.
In 1966 Attwood competed in Australia and New Zealand as a part of BRM&#x27;s Tasman Series squad. His Tasman performances were very promising, including a win at Levin, but despite this – perhaps due to his underwhelming 1965 Formula One performances and growing success in sports cars – Attwood sat out the majority of the and Formula One seasons. His only appearance came as a substitute for works-Cooper driver Pedro Rodríguez at the 1967 Canadian Grand Prix, bringing the Cooper-Maserati home in 10th place. During 1966 he maintained his run of form in Formula Two, taking victory in the Rome Grand Prix and a second place at Pau in 1966, but concentrated firmly on sports cars in 1967.

After Mike Spence&#x27;s death during practice for the 1968 Indianapolis 500 race Attwood rejoined the BRM works team, now run by Parnell, as his replacement. Attwood&#x27;s first race on his return was perhaps his most spectacular, taking fastest lap in the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix, on his way to a strong second-place finish behind Graham Hill&#x27;s works Lotus. However, results declined through the remainder of the season, and four races from the end Attwood was himself replaced by Bobby Unser.

Always something of a Monaco specialist, it was in the principality that Richard Attwood made his final Formula One start. Colin Chapman brought in the Briton as substitute for the injured Jochen Rindt, driving the Lotus 49B. He finished in a respectable fourth-place. Although this was his last Formula One drive, he did appear at the 1969 German Grand Prix in a Formula Two Brabham for Frank Williams, where he finished sixth overall, and second in the Formula Two class.

==Sports car racing==

In 1964, as Attwood was taking his first steps in Formula One, he was also approached by the Ford GT prototype project team, later to evolve into the Ford GT40, and became one of the first drivers to take the iconic car onto a race track. He shared a GT40 with Jo Schlesser in the 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans, but was forced to retire due to the car catching fire. His first major international sports car victory came at the 1964 Rand 9 Hours race in South Africa, driving David Piper&#x27;s Ferrari P2.

It was with David Piper that Attwood developed perhaps his longest lasting professional relationship. He drove Piper&#x27;s green Ferraris – including the 250LM and 330P3/4 – on many occasions over the following five years, collecting a few point finishes in World Sportscar Championship events, and paired up with Piper for the Maranello Concessionaires team. Highlights during this time included a third place in the Spa 1000 km and second in the 500km Zeltweg in 1967. Attwood did not restrict himself to Ferrari and Ford though, putting in drives in machinery as diverse as the Porsche 906 and Alfa Romeo T33. He was also one of the few drivers to race the infamous Ford P68, GT successor to the GT40, failing to finish due to mechanical maladies during the 1968 1000km Nürburgring.

Having driven privateer Porsches, for the 1969 World Sportscar Championship season Attwood was signed to the Porsche works team. Commonly paired with fellow Brit Vic Elford, the season&#x27;s highlights were a pair of second places, driving the Porsche 908, in the BOAC 500 (the drivers&#x27; home race at Brands Hatch) and the Watkins Glen 6h race. Later in the season Attwood was again involved in the development of an iconic sports racing car: the Porsche 917. The Elford/Attwood pairing took their 917 up to 327 laps in the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans, but the car suffered a gearbox failure with only two hours to go, after leading for a substantial portion of the race.
Attwood subsequently went on to win the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1970 with a Porsche 917K, along with Hans Herrmann. Hermann and Attwood also took second place in the 1970 Nürburgring race, this time back in a 908. Driving with Herbie Müller once more in a Porsche 917 he finished second in the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans, this time for the John Wyer privateer team. At the end of the season, after also winning the 1000km Zeltweg race along with his teammate Pedro Rodríguez, Attwood retired from motorsport.

Attwood came out of retirement briefly in 1984, as a part of the moribund Aston Martin Nimrod Le Mans project. Following his car&#x27;s failure to finish in the 1984 24 Hours of Le Mans race after a hideously violent accident while John Sheldon was driving, Attwood retired from front line racing for good. With the growth in popularity of historic motorsport, he frequently appeared in events and Porsche shows with his own Porsche 917, which Steve McQueen used in his film &quot;Le Mans&quot;. The car was painted to represent his 1970 Le Mans-winner, and Attwood referred to it as &quot;my pension&quot;, as the value of the car had risen rapidly over the decades since he bought it in the 1970s. In 2000 Atwood cashed-in his pension, when he sold the car in an auction for £1 million. Today he is still very active in historic motorsport, often making memorable appearances at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, among many yearly excursions.

== Personal life ==
Attwood once owned a 1989 Peugeot 405 estate which he bought new and successfully drove 415,000 miles, with the original engine and clutch. This was the subject of an article in Evo. On 13 June 2017 it was put up for sale by a subsequent owner, but as of 18 June the ad, with almost 2000 views, had no offers.&#x27;

<text>William Ronald Flockhart (16 June 1923 – 12 April 1962) was a British racing driver. He participated in 14 World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, achieving one podium finish and won the 24 Hours of Le Mans sportscar race twice.

==Racing career==
Flockhart started competing in 1951 in a JP Formula 3 car. He purchased the famous ERA R4D from Raymond Mays and in 1953 had a very successful season, beating one of the works BRMs at Goodwood. He achieved podium finishes at Goodwood, Charterhall, Snetterton and Crystal Palace, as well as several hill climb successes.

Flockhart&#x27;s best World Championship result was third place at the 1956 Italian Grand Prix in a Connaught Type B. In 1959, driving a BRM P25, he won the Lady Wigram Trophy, and qualified on pole, set fastest lap and won the non-championship Silver City Trophy.

In 1956, driving for the Scottish team Ecurie Ecosse, he won the 1956 24 Hours of Le Mans, sharing an ex-works Jaguar D-type with Ninian Sanderson. The following year he won again for the same team, this time sharing with Ivor Bueb, setting a distance record of .

== Record flight attempts and death ==
In the early 1960s, the United Dominions Trust made plans to break the record for the time taken to fly from Sydney to London in order to gain publicity for its UDT Laystall racing team. A Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation-built Mustang World War Two fighter was purchased in Australia and Flockhart was engaged to make the attempt. Flockhart departed Sydney in the Mustang, registered G-ARKD, on 28 February 1961 and after several delays due to bad weather finally ended the attempt at Athens due to engine problems. Flockhart subsequently entered the London-Cardiff Air Race to be held in June that year but withdrew because G-ARKD was still in Athens. G-ARKD was abandoned and another CAC Mustang, registered VH-UWB, was bought in Australia for Flockhart to make a second attempt at the Sydney-London record. On 12 April 1962, while on a test flight in preparation for the record attempt, Flockhart crashed VH-UWB in poor weather near Kallista, Victoria, and was killed.

<text>Stuart Nigel Lewis-Evans (20 April 1930 – 25 October 1958) was a British racing driver from England. He participated in 14 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 19 May 1957. He achieved two podiums, and scored a total of 16 championship points. He also achieved two pole positions.

==Early life==
Stuart Lewis-Evans was born in Luton, Bedfordshire, but largely grew up in Kent, where his father, Lewis &quot;Pop&quot; Lewis-Evans, owned and ran a garage business. Pop Lewis-Evans had previously been a mechanic for the well-known racing driver Earl Howe, but had not previously raced himself. On leaving school, Lewis-Evans was apprenticed for three years to Vauxhall Motors, back in Bedfordshire, before he was called up for National Service. During this time he served as a motorcycle despatch rider for the Royal Corps of Signals.

==Career==
Lewis-Evans began racing in 1951 with a Cooper 500 Formula 3 car, encouraged by and sometimes racing against his father. He achieved many wins and podia and continued to race in 500s until 1956, with the engines prepared by Francis Beart during the later years, including a 1–2 victory at Nurburgring in May 1954 with Stirling Moss in Coopers, with Moss, first, in a Beart Cooper and Lewis-Evans, second, in a Cooper with a Beart-prepared engine.

In 1957, he won the 1957 Glover Trophy, run to Formula One rules at Goodwood. In his first championship Formula One race, the 1957 Monaco Grand Prix, Lewis-Evans finished fourth in an inferior Connaught Type B, beaten only by multiple winners Fangio and Brooks, and Masten Gregory in one of the dominant Maserati 250F cars. This performance brought him to the attention of Tony Vandervell, owner of the rising Vanwall team, and by the next Grand Prix Lewis-Evans was driving the third Vanwall. The 1957 Vanwall was fast when its engine held together, but not always reliable. Lewis-Evans achieved his best finish for Vanwall when he was 2nd at the year&#x27;s non-championship Moroccan Grand Prix. He took pole position at the final World Championship event, the Italian Grand Prix, but had to retire with engine problems.

The 1958 Formula One season would prove to be a much better year, at least initially, for the entire Vanwall team. Principal drivers Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks took three victories each, and Lewis-Evans added to the team&#x27;s points haul with podium finishes in the Belgian and Portuguese events. He also took pole position at the Dutch Grand Prix, but failed to finish in the race. This was not his only retirement of the year – indeed his only other finish, although points-scoring, was a fourth place at the British Grand Prix.

Lewis-Evans crashed heavily at the dusty Ain-Diab Circuit during the season-ending Moroccan Grand Prix. His car&#x27;s engine seized and sent him lurching into barriers at high speed, where it burst into flames. He was airlifted back to the UK, but died of his burns in hospital six days after the accident. His death cast a pall over Vanwall&#x27;s victory in the 1958 International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, an achievement to which Lewis-Evans had contributed significantly. Vandervell never fully recovered from Lewis-Evans&#x27;s death and withdrew from motorsport at the end of 1958.

<text>Troy Lynn Ruttman (March 11, 1930 – May 19, 1997) was an American racing driver. He is best known for winning the 1952 Indianapolis 500 - at the age of 22 years and 80 days, Ruttman remains the youngest ever winner of the event. Competing since the age of 15, he had a remarkably successful early career, winning several regional and AAA-sanctioned championships.

== Driving career ==

=== Early career ===

In 1945, at age 15, Ruttman entered his family&#x27;s car into a roadster race held in San Bernardino, California, winning the event. He won 19 of the 21 events staged there that season. By 1947 he was the California Roadster Association (CRA) roadster champion. He also won his first five midget car races that season. In 1948 he repeated as the CRA roadster champion, United Racing Association Blue Circuit (Offy) championship, and 23 midget car events.

=== Sprint car career ===

In May 1949, Ruttman left California for the AAA Sprint and Championship car circuits of the Midwest. He won three AAA Sprint Car championships over the next three and a half seasons. He competed in 51 midget races, winning 16 and placing in the top three 28 times.

=== Championship car career ===

Ruttman drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1949–1952, 1954, 1956–1957 and 1960–1964 seasons with 58 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 races during 1949–1952, 1954, 1956–1957, and 1960–1964. His best championship finish was as runner-up to Chuck Stevenson for the 1952 National Championship.

His victory in the 1952 Indianapolis 500 made him the youngest winner of the event.

An injury during a sprint car crash in August 1952 sidelined Ruttman for one and a half racing seasons. Ruttman returned in 1954 on a greatly reduced schedule, never attaining the same level of success. He had not been diligent during his recovery, gaining weight, and spending time partying - a competitor remarked that Ruttman was a case of &quot;too much, too young.&quot;

=== Stock car career ===

Ruttman won the 1956 USAC Short Track Stock Car division title. Ruttman also competed in seven races in the NASCAR Grand National Series from 1962 to 1964, finishing in the top ten five times. His best finish was third in the 1963 race at Riverside International Raceway, running behind Dan Gurney and A. J. Foyt.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship points and participation in addition to those which they received towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Ruttman participated in seven World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. He was also the first of a small number of USAC/Indianapolis drivers to start an FIA-sanctioned World Drivers&#x27; Championship event during the 1950-1960 period - competing for Scuderia Centro Sud in the 1958 French Grand Prix. During his World Drivers&#x27; Championship career, Ruttman won once, and he accumulated 9.5 World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

Ruttman&#x27;s victory in the 1952 Indianapolis 500 earned him the distinction of being the youngest driver to win a round of the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, an honor he held until Fernando Alonso won the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix.

== Retirement and death ==

After concluding his racing career at the age of 34, Ruttman relocated to Plymouth, Michigan, operating a motorcycle and snowmobile dealership.

Ruttman died as a result of lung cancer on May 19, 1997, at Lake Havasu City, Arizona, just a month before the long planned &quot;Troy Ruttman Day&quot; in his hometown of Mooreland, Oklahoma.

== Awards and honors ==

Ruttman has been inducted into the following halls of fame:
* Michigan Motor Sports Hall of Fame (1982)
* Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1992)
* National Sprint Car Hall of Fame (1993)
* West Coast Stock Car/Motorsports Hall of Fame (2002)

<text>The delegations as they existed in 1859









Between the Congress of Vienna (1815) and the capture of Rome (1870), the Papal State was subdivided geographically into 17 apostolic delegations (&quot;delegazioni apostoliche&quot;) for administrative purposes. These were instituted by Pope Pius VII in a &quot;motu proprio&quot; of 6 July 1816: &quot;Quando per ammirabile disposizione&quot;.

A delegation was known as a legation (&quot;legazione&quot;) when governed by a cardinal. The four northernmost delegations—Bologna, Ferrara, Forlì and Ravenna, which comprised the region known as the Romagne (plural of Romagna)—were regularly governed by cardinals. Thus, the term &quot;Legations&quot; or Papal Legations (&quot;Legazioni pontificie&quot;), when used on its own, often refers to the Romagne. In an administrative reform of 1850, Pius IX grouped the delegations into five larger legations. The four original legations were joined into the legation of the Romagne. In 1859, the Kingdom of Sardinia invaded the Papal State and set up a military government, the United Provinces of Central Italy, that included the Romagne. Following a plebiscite, the Romagne were formally annexed to Sardinia in 1860.

==&quot;Motu proprio&quot; of 1816==
Between 1798 and 1800, and again between 1809 and 1814, the Papal State was occupied by French troops and the pope was in exile. After the restoration of the Papal State by the Congress of Vienna, Pius VII set about reforming its administration, assisted by Cardinal Secretary of State Ercole Consalvi. The result was the &quot;motu prioprio&quot; of 6 July 1816 &quot;on the organization of public administration&quot;.

The existing 12 provinces were abandoned in favour of 17 delegations, although Rome and its hinterland formed a separate &quot;comarca&quot;. The new administration was modelled on that introduced by the French.

The new delegations were grouped into three classes. At the head of each delegation was a delegate (&quot;delegato&quot;) who was appointed by the pope through an act of the secretary of state and who was invariably a prelate. Only in case the prelate was a cardinal did he assume the title of legate (&quot;legato&quot;), and cardinals could only be appointed to the delegations of the first class. Each delegate or legate was assisted by two assessors appointed by the pope, one for civil law matters and one for penal law matters, and by a locally selected Governmental Congregation (&quot;Congregazione governativa&quot; ), the composition of which varied according to the class of the delegation:
*In those of the first class, there were four members: two selected from the capital city and two from the hinterland.
*In those of the second class, there were three members: two from the capital and one from the hinterland.
*In those of the third class, there were two members: one from the capital and one from the hinterland.

In each delegation, the administration of justice was devolved on a court of first instance (&quot;tribunale di prima istanza&quot;) for civil matters and a criminal court (&quot;tribunale criminale&quot;) for crimes. Some of the delegations were subdivided into districts, each headed by a governor. The arrangement created by the &quot;motu proprio&quot; of 1816 looked like this:
==Reforms==
===Provinces of 1820===
In 1820, the delegations and the &quot;comarca&quot; of Rome were grouped into 11 provinces (&quot;province&quot;). The delegations of Camerino, Benevento, Bologna and Ferrara were their own provinces under those names. Rieti was its own province, called Sabina, and Urbino e Pesaro was synonymous with the province called Urbino. Rome was joined with Frosinone to form the province of Marittima e Campagna. Viterbo and Civitavecchia were joined to form the province of Patrimonio; Perugia and Spoleto the province of Umbria; Ancona, Ascoli, Fermo and Macerata the province of the Marche; and Forlì and Ravenna the province of Romagna.

===Leo XII (1825) and Gregory XVI (1831–32)===
Leo XII, successor of Pius VII, issued a &quot;motu proprio&quot; on 5 October 1825, which reduced the number of delegations from 17 to 13 by combining Fermo and Ascoli, Macerata and Camerino, Spoleto and Rieti and Viterbo and Civitavecchia.

In an edict issued on 5 July 1831, Leo XII&#x27;s successor, Gregory XVI, reversed his reform and also created a new delegation based on Orvieto out of the territory of the delegation of Viterbo. He raised the number of delegations to 19 the following year with his &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Luminose prove&quot; of 1 February 1832. The new delegation, based on Velletri and carved out of that of Frosinone, was granted to the Dean of the College of Cardinals and thus constituted a new legation. Although boundaries would change, subsequent reforms would retain a legate at Velletri.

===New legations of Pius IX===

In 1848, Pius IX, facing revolution in Rome, promulgated a new constitution for the Papal State. It was not enough to quell the revolution and he fled to take refuge in the Kingdom of Naples. In 1849, a Roman Republic was declared. It was crushed by a French army, and Pius returned to Rome on 12 April 1850.

On 22 November 1850, Pius IX issued an edict grouping the 19 delegations into four new legations and a district (&quot;circondario&quot;, circle or circumscription) around Rome. Each of the new higher-level legations was entrusted to a cardinal.

==Local government==
===1816–47===
Pius VII completely reformed the municipal administration. All municipal laws from before or during the Revolution were repealed and municipal government was made uniform across the Papal State.

Local governments were divided into those of the first class (&quot;di primo ordine&quot;), which were the larger cities, and those of the second (&quot;di secondo&quot;), which were all other &quot;comuni&quot; (municipalities). Each municipality was governed by a mayor called a governor (&quot;governatore&quot;) appointed by the pope through the secretary of state. Governors of the first class were appointed by papal brief, while those of the second class merely by letters patent. Governors were not necessarily ecclesiastics, and they had to be neither native to nor resident in their municipalities. They were under the authority of the apostolic delegates. The governors held judicial authority in cases involving less than 100 &quot;scudi&quot;, in property disputes and in some other cases. They were charged with policing fairs and festivals.

Pius VII introduced into each &quot;comune&quot; a council (&quot;consiglio&quot;) with deliberative functions and a magistracy (&quot;magistratura&quot;) with executive functions. The functions of the magistracy had previously belonged to the higher authorities. The original members of the councils were selected by the delegates, but subsequently new councilors were co-opted. The magistracy was composed of elders (&quot;anziani&quot;) drawn from the council under the leadership of a &quot;gonfaloniere&quot; (literally, standard-bearer), who was not required to be a councilor. The &quot;gonfalonieri&quot; were chosen by the secretary of state, while the elders were chosen by the delegate from a list of names submitted by the council.

The small rural villages of the &quot;comuni&quot; each had their own syndic (&quot;sindaco&quot;) or procurator (&quot;procuratore&quot;) subject to the communal &quot;gonfaloniere&quot;.

===1847–70===
On 1 October 1847, Pius IX issued the &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Sull&#x27;organizzazione del Consiglio e Senato di Roma e le sue attribuzioni&quot;, which extended to Rome the laws applicable in the other municipalities. Rome thus received a council of 100 men: 96 laymen chosen through the census to represent various professions and 4 clergy chosen by the Cardinal Vicar. The Senator was made &quot;gonfaloniere&quot; (mayor) and presided over an executive body (the magistracy) composed of eight conservators (&quot;conservatori&quot;).

The Roman revolution of 1848 interrupted the reforming process that had begun with Rome the previous year, but in an edict of 24 November 1850, in implementation of Pius IX&#x27;s &quot;motu prioprio&quot; of 12 September 1849, Cardinal Giacomo Antonelli defined the new competences of the council and magistracy. The councils would now:
*nominate their own employees and those on their payroll
*run the school system
*maintain the roads and other communal infrastructure (bridges, aqueducts, fountains, etc.)
*operate the public utilities
*approve the annual &quot;tabella&quot; (budget)

The magistracy would now:
*execute the decisions of the council
*sign contracts on behalf of the council
*prepare the annual budget and accounting statements

The municipalities were divided into five classes based on population, which determined how many councilors they would get:
*&gt; 20,000 inhabitants → first class → 36 councilors
*&gt; 10,000 inhabitants → second class → 30 councilors
*&gt; 5,000 inhabitants → third class → 24 councilors
*&gt; 1,000 inhabitants → fourth class → 16 councilors
*&lt; 1,000 inhabitants → fifth class → 10 councilors

The councilors were to be selected by the delegate and approved by the Cardinal Prefect of the Sacra Consulta. Rome&#x27;s council was reduced from 100 to 48.

<text>Umberto Maglioli (5 June 1928 – 7 February 1999) was a racing driver from Italy. He participated in 10 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 13 September 1953. He achieved 2 podiums, and scored a total of 3 championship points. He participated in the Targa Florio race nineteen times, winning it three times, and the Mille Miglia ten times, with the best result being a second place in the Lancia Aurelia B20 GT in 1951.

Born in Bioglio, Vercelli, he was introduced to racing by Giovanni Bracco and accompanied him on several Mille Miglias and Targa Florios. In 1953 he won the Targa (single-handed) for the first time, in a Lancia D20, and also the Pescara 12hr race, driving a Ferrari 375 MM with Mike Hawthorn. Maglioli also won the last Carrera Panamericana in 1954, driving the Ferrari 375 Plus. The same year he also won the 1000 km Buenos Aires (with Giuseppe Farina) and the 1000Km Supercortemaggiore at Monza, again with Hawthorn.

He joined Porsche in 1956 and won the Targa Florio, again single-handed. In 1957 under established rules which allowed F2 cars to enter Grand Prix, Porsche entered two 550RSs for the German Grand Prix, one driven by Maglioli and the other by Edgar Barth. Maglioli though failed to finish. Later that year he crashed his Porsche during the Gaisburg hillclimb in Austria. He recuperated in a hospital in Salzburg with leg injuries so severe that doctors initially feared he may not walk again. 

In 1964 he won the Sebring 12hrs for Ferrari and in 1968 scored his third Targa victory (this time with Vic Elford) in a works Porsche 907. Maglioli retired from racing in 1970. He died in Monza in 1999.

<doc id="1235884" wikidata="Q171881" url="?curid=1235884" title="Willy Mairesse">
<text>Willy Mairesse (; 1 October 1928 – 2 September 1969) was a Formula One and sports-car driver from Belgium. He participated in 13 World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 19 June 1960. He achieved one podium and scored a total of seven championship points. He committed suicide (overdose of sleeping pills) in a hotel room in Ostend after a crash at the 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans forced an end to his career.

Peter Revson once described the intensity of Mairesse before a race at Spa, Belgium. Revson looked into his car and saw Mairesse&#x27;s &quot;furrowed&quot; face, beetled brows, and eyes which were almost tilted and their colour changed. &quot;It was almost like looking at the devil.&quot;

==Sports car driver==

Mairesse won first place in the marathon rally Liege-Rome-Liege in 1956.
Mairesse secured third place in the Grand Prix of Monza in June 1959. Driving a Ferrari, he placed behind Alfonso Thiele and Carlo Mario Abate, both also in Ferraris. Mairesse and Mike Parkes of England finished second to Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien at the 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans. Driving a Ferrari 250 TR/61, Mairesse and Parkes also eclipsed the previous Le Mans record, covering 2,758.66 miles. In the 1963 12 Hours of Sebring Mairesse and Nino Vacarella placed second after Ludovico Scarfiotti and John Surtees. Both teams drove Ferraris. Surtees and Mairesse won the 1000 km of the Nurburgring driving a Ferrari 250P. Thereafter, Surtees and Mairesse led for the 15 hours of the first 18 hours of the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans before the car caught fire while Mairesse was driving. Mairesse escaped injury. Scarfiotti and Lorenzo Bandini won on the French circuit where Christian Heins had a fatal accident. Mairesse and Surtees retired after a motor fire. A young German Red Cross worker was killed in August 1963 when the wheel of a Ferrari driven by Mairesse came off as his car overturned. Guenther Schneider, 19, was hit by a flying wheel during the running of the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring and died. Mairesse was triumphant in the 1964 Grand Prix of Angola, run at Luanda. His average speed was 80.78 miles per hour. Mairesse piloted a Ferrari 250 LM to first place in the 500 km sportscar race of Spa in May 1965. He completed the race in 2 hours, 29 minutes, and 45.7 seconds. He achieved an average speed of 126.29. Mairesse and Jean Beurlys of France finished third at the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans in a Ferrari 275 GTB winning the GT category in its debut at Le Mans, while Masten Gregory and Jochen Rindt won the race. In April 1966 Surtees and Parkes won the 1,000 kilometer Monza Auto Race. Mairesse and Herbert Mueller of Switzerland came in third in a Ford sports car, two laps behind. In May Mairesse and Mueller drove to victory in the Targa Florio, driving a Porsche Carrera 6. Rain caused considerable attrition as only thirteen of seventy starters finished the race. Mairesse and Beurlys again drove a Ferrari to third place in the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans. This event was won by the American team
of Dan Gurney and A. J. Foyt.

==Formula One==
Mairesse was third in the Grand Prix of Europe, 1960 Italian Grand Prix. This was the penultimate race of the 1960 Formula One World Championship. Run at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Phil Hill was victorious, with Richie Ginther second, and Mairesse third, a lap down. Mairesse qualified fifth for the 1962 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa. The pole was won by Graham Hill in a BRM. During the event Mairesse
and the Lotus of Trevor Taylor dueled for more than an hour, passing and repassing a number of times each lap. Mairesse was
cheered heartily by an enthusiastic partisan crowd. The two cars came together at more than 100 miles per hour in the long, sweeping,
left-hand Blanchimont turn. Mairesse&#x27;s car went off to the left, careening into a hillside behind a ditch, and caught fire after flipping over. He was thrown out of his Ferrari and his shoes and the legs of his trousers were torn off. He was conscious, despite numerous scrapes, cuts, and burns. Mairesse was loaded into an ambulance and transported to a hospital, where he was reported to be in good spirits and without any serious injuries. Taylor and Mairesse made contact earlier in the season at the Grand Prix of Brussels. In a race in which only twelve of twenty-one starters finished, Mairesse came in fourth in the 1962 Italian Grand Prix. He was only a car length ahead of Giancarlo Baghetti.

Out of Formula One in 1963, Phil Hill predicted a rough future for the Ferrari team. He said there was too much competition between Mairesse and Surtees. Specifically, he commented &quot;they will harry each other so much that they will force each other to make mistakes&quot;. Mairesse&#x27;s car crashed during the 1963 German Grand Prix. The Ferrari turned over multiple times after swerving off the track. He was rushed to the hospital with a broken arm. His teammate, Surtees, won the race, with Jim Clark second in a Lotus.

<doc id="1235885" wikidata="Q173315" url="?curid=1235885" title="Jean-Christophe Boullion">
<text>Jean-Christophe Joël Louis &quot;Jules&quot; Boullion (born 27 December 1969) is a French former racing driver. He won the 1994 International Formula 3000 Championship with DAMS, took two Le Mans Series titles with the Pescarolo Sport outfit in 2005 and 2006, and took two podium finishes at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Boullion also competed in 11 Formula One races for the Sauber team.

==Career==
Born in Saint-Brieuc, near Côtes d&#x27;Armor, Boullion started karting in 1982 and moved to cars in 1988 after attending a racing school outside Paris. He started racing in Formula Ford 1600 in 1989. The following year he won the French title and moved to Formula 3. In 1993 he entered Formula 3000 and won the FIA International Championship in 1994. Although he was signed to test for Williams, he was loaned to Sauber to replace Karl Wendlinger for much of the 1995 season, scoring points twice but rarely matching his team-mate Heinz-Harald Frentzen. The following year he returned to his testing role at Williams, and he later tested for Jordan and Tyrrell.

In 1997 he raced briefly in the Renault Spider Eurocup, and he campaigned a Renault Laguna touring car for the Williams team in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) in 1999, acquiring the nickname &#x27;JCB&#x27; from commentator Charlie Cox.

From 2000 onward, Boullion would turn his focus to prototype racing. Having raced at Le Mans with Racing Organisation Course in 2000, the Frenchman moved to the Pescarolo Sport outfit the following year, taking a first success with a win at Magny-Cours in the FIA Sportscar Championship. He remained in the series for the 2002 season, winning the opening and final race respectively alongside Sébastien Bourdais, though Boullion missed out on the title to Racing for Holland after missing the round at Brno. After returning for two races in 2003 to take a victory at Estoril, Boullion did not race at all in 2004 as a result of the FIA Sportscar Championship&#x27;s demise. In 2005, he returned to race in the newer Le Mans Endurance Series, partnering Emmanuel Collard at Pescarolo. The duo ended up as title winners with two victories to their names, beating Zytek Motorsport by just two points. In the same year, Boullion and Collard, along with endurance-race teammate Érik Comas finished second overall at the Le Mans 24 Hours. The 2006 season proved to be a particular highlight for Boullion despite not racing at Le Mans, as he would win all five races in the Le Mans Series together with Collard on their way to a successful title defence.

From the 2007 season, things would become more difficult for Boullion and Pescarolo, as they would now have to compete as a privateer against their factory outfit in Team Peugeot. Though the title battle lasted until the final round owing to Peugeot&#x27;s non-participation at Silverstone, the factory team came out victorious, with Boullion having to settle for the runner-up spot with four podiums from six events. At Le Mans, the Frenchman scored his second and final podium at the Sarthe, coming third behind the Audi and Peugeot works entries. The former would pose a further threat in the Le Mans Series in 2008, as Audi entered two cars into the championship, with Boullion still driving for the Pescarolo privateer. Having scored one podium at the end of the year, the French driver ended up sixth in the points battle.

In 2009, Boullion was joined by Christophe Tinseau, with whom he would take two second places at the start of the campaign before winning at the Algarve. However, a retirement at the Nürburgring would cost the pair dearly, as it handed the title advantage to Aston Martin Racing, who would take the championship at the final round, leaving Boullion and his teammate in second.

He moved to Rebellion Racing ahead of the 2010 season, where he and Andrea Belicchi scored a sole podium. The pair remained together for 2011 as a pair of podiums landed them second in the standings, just three points behind the title-winning Pescarolo squad. Subsequently, Boullion would return there for 2012, driving in the opening round of the FIA World Endurance Championship at Sebring. He was later slated to race at Le Mans, but a practice crash which damaged his ribs would sideline him from the race.

<doc id="1235886" wikidata="Q172504" url="?curid=1235886" title="Horace Gould">
<text>Horace Gould (born Horace Harry Twigg 20 September 1921 – 4 November 1968) was a British racing driver from Bristol.

==Career==
Known for his portly frame and larger-than-life character, Gould began racing sports cars in 1952 at the wheel of a Cooper-MG. He moved into Formula One in 1954, competing as a privateer and using the team name &quot;Gould&#x27;s Garage (Bristol)&quot;.

He participated in 17 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 17 July 1954, plus numerous non-Championship races. He scored a total of two championship points, thanks to driving his Maserati 250F to fifth place in the 1956 British Grand Prix, enough to earn him joint 19th place in that season&#x27;s World Championship. He won minor non-championship Formula One races at Castle Combe in 1954 and Aintree in 1956, and also won two points in the 1957 World Sportscar Championship, finishing in fifth place in that season&#x27;s 1000km of Nürburgring, sharing a Maserati 300S with teammates Stirling Moss, Juan Manuel Fangio and Chico Godia.

Although most of Gould&#x27;s career was spent in England, he also had spells living and racing in New Zealand and Modena, Italy, home of the Maserati factory.

The similarity of Gould&#x27;s build and driving style to those of José Froilán González led to him being dubbed &quot;the Gonzalez of the West Country&quot;.

Gould died suddenly, in Southmead, Bristol, of a cerebral haemorrhage, at the age of 47. His sons Martin, Stephen and Richard still live in Bristol. Martin went into motor racing and raced in Formula 3, and two of his grandchildren Daniel Gould and James Gould also had careers at a young age in motorsport.

<doc id="1235887" wikidata="Q3255718" url="?curid=1235887" title="F-19 Stealth Fighter">
<text>F-19 Stealth Fighter is a combat flight simulator developed and released in 1988 (PC DOS) and 1990 (Amiga and Atari ST) by MicroProse, featuring a fictional United States military aircraft. It is the 16-bit remake of the 8-bit game &quot;Project Stealth Fighter&quot;, which was released for the Commodore 64 in 1987. It was also ported to the NEC PC-9801 in Japan only, and the DOS version was re-released on Steam distribution platform in 2015.

&quot;F-19 Stealth Fighter&quot; was developed before the public unveiling in 1988 of the F-117 Nighthawk attack aircraft – which the video game sought to represent – and carried over the focus on the fictional F-19 from &quot;Project Stealth Fighter&quot;, based on the 1986 F-19 model kit released by Testors. Although an aircraft selection screen offering the real F-117 was added, MicroProse&#x27;s rendering of the optional &quot;real&quot; jet was based on the deliberately vague 1988 press photo of the aircraft and had distinctly wrong, stubby and wide proportions.

Critically acclaimed, the game was followed in 1991 by &quot;Night Hawk: F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0&quot;, which finally removed the old, fictitious aircraft design and instead offered only a new, much more accurate model of the real F-117.

==Gameplay==

In the game, the player takes on the role of a pilot flying missions of varying difficulty over four geographic locations: Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya, the Persian Gulf, the North Cape, and Central Europe. The game can be played under conditions of conventional warfare, limited warfare, or cold war (in the latter, even being detected by the enemy can lead to a major diplomatic incident).

The player can choose appropriate ordnance from a wide range of realistic armaments, and the game features convincing behavior from AI-controlled units such as enemy aircraft, SAM sites and radar stations. These behave in accordance with the situation – patrolling at first, but launching into a highly aggressive search if the player is detected. Other features of the game are a realistic system of radar detection, where the player&#x27;s varying radar signature is visually compared with the energy of incoming radar pulses at different ranges and powers, and a variety of endings appropriate to the outcome of each mission. These include the player being rescued by a V-22 Osprey, a &quot;Pravda&quot; newspaper headline proclaiming the capture of the pilot, or an outraged ally or neutral nation protesting the destruction of their aircraft.

The pilot roster in the pre-game menu keeps track of the missions, rank, score and medals awarded to each player. Pilot fatalities are permanent, which contributes to the extended campaign feeling of the game.

== Copy protection ==
At the beginning of the game, the player has to pass &quot;Aircraft Identification Exam&quot; - a picture of a plane is shown and the player must select the correct plane from a list. If the player selects the wrong plane, they will be restricted to flying training missions with preset equipment.

==Development==
After the completion of &quot;Project Stealth Fighter&quot; for the Commodore 64 by designers Jim Synoski and Arnold Hendrick, Sid Meier and Andy Hollis were brought in to work on the PC conversion. Hendrick wrote of the new game: &quot;The only thing borrowed from the C64 would be the game scenario concepts, military equipment research data, and perhaps some flight dynamics algorithms&quot;. Despite its planned 30 September 1988 release being delayed to mid-November &quot;F-19 Stealth Fighter&quot; was very popular, selling out in just two months.

MicroProse released the game on the same day that the United States military first admitted the existence of its F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter. Before the game&#x27;s release, many had speculated on a missing aircraft in the United States Air Force&#x27;s numbering system, the F-19. The game was based on an educated guess about what the secret stealth fighter would be like. Subsequent revisions of the game incorporated the actual F-117 as well as the F-19.

The original boxed version of the game came with a range of accessories, such as a thick manual full of information on the late 1980s flying machines of the U.S. and the USSR, various keyboard overlays, a comprehensive manual covering stealth and fighter tactics, and roughly-sketched maps of each warzone.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1989 gave &quot;F-19 Stealth Fighter&quot; a very favorable review and acclaimed the game&#x27;s level of realism, stating that &quot;to master this program you are going to have to do your homework. The documentation includes tutorials on aerodynamics and flight principles, radar, stealth technology, air-to-ground tactics, and air-to-air tactics&quot;. A 1992 survey in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game three stars out of five, and a 1994 survey gave it two-plus stars. &quot;Compute!&quot; favorably reviewed the IBM PC version&#x27;s graphics and realism.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; recognized &quot;F-19&quot; as the &quot;Simulation Game of the Year&quot;, calling it a perfect marriage of modern technology and game. Software Publishers Association gave the game its Excellence in Software Award for &quot;Best Simulation&quot;. The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum selected &quot;F-19 Stealth Fighter&quot; for a 1989 exhibition on &quot;Flight Enters the Computer Age&quot;. In 1990 the game received the sixth-highest number of votes in a survey of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; readers&#x27; &quot;All-Time Favorites&quot;. The game&#x27;s ports won the Golden Joystick Awards &#x27;91 in the category &quot;Best Simulation - 16 Bit&quot;. &quot;F-19&quot; was ranked as the 29th best Amiga game by &quot;Amiga Power&quot; in 1991, and as the 52nd best game of all time by &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1996.

&quot;F-19 Stealth Fighter&quot; was awarded the Origins Award for &quot;Best Military or Strategy Computer Game of 1988&quot; and &quot;Best Screen Graphics in a Home Computer Game of 1988&quot;.

<doc id="1235888" wikidata="Q172644" url="?curid=1235888" title="Jack Fairman">
<text>John Eric George &quot;Jack&quot; Fairman (15 March 1913 – 7 February 2002) was a British racing driver from England. He participated in 13 Formula One Grands Prix, making his debut on 18 July 1953. He scored a total of five championship points, all of which came in the 1956 season.

==Career summary==
Fairman was born in Horley, and was only an occasional racing driver, his main source of income coming from running the family precision tool manufacturing company. He got his first taste of motorsport before World War II, driving an Alvis 12/50 in trials and hill climb events from 1934. He quickly moved on to races at the Brooklands circuit, but the war intervened and he spent the duration on active service in the Tank Corps.

Postwar, Fairman&#x27;s reliable and dogged driving attributes saw him achieve many successes in sports car racing, particularly in endurance events. He drove for a number of top-rank teams during this time, including Bristol, Jaguar, Ecurie Ecosse, and Aston Martin. It was with Aston that Fairman won his most significant events, partnering Stirling Moss in the 1959 Nürburgring 1000 km, and Tourist Trophy at Goodwood. He also made a brief Formula One debut at the 1953 British Grand Prix, driving and retiring an HWM 53.

His engineering experience and dependable driving made him an obvious choice for constructors to contact when they needed a test driver. His most significant contribution in this role was during the development of Connaught&#x27;s Formula Two and later Formula One cars. Between sports car commitments and his own factory, Fairman managed to fit in occasional Formula One starts, usually at the British or Italian Grands Prix. He took a Connaught Type B to two points finishes during the 1956 Formula One season, his only points in a very long Formula One career, finishing tenth in the World Championship that year.

Following Bernie Ecclestone&#x27;s purchase of the remains of Connaught in 1958, Fairman continued with his sporadic Formula One career in a wide variety of machines. His only notable entry in the years that followed was when he became simultaneously the last man ever to start a Grand Prix with a front engined car &quot;and&quot; the first to drive a four-wheel drive car, at the 1961 British Grand Prix. The car in question was the experimental Ferguson P99, designed by Ferguson Research Ltd. and run by the Rob Walker Racing Team. Unfortunately for Fairman, his RWR teammate Stirling Moss suffered brake failure in his Lotus 18 and took over the 4WD machine in Fairman&#x27;s stead. Moss was then later disqualified for receiving a push start, which also ended Fairman&#x27;s race. Fairman&#x27;s last Formula One race was in the 1963 non-Championship Imola Grand Prix event, driving a Porsche for Ecurie Maarsbergen.

Fairman died, aged 88, in Rugby, Warwickshire. The pub chain Wetherspoons has opened a pub named The Jack Fairman in his birthplace of Horley. Opened on 12 February 2007, it occupies the buildings in Victoria Road which originally housed Fairman&#x27;s garage and has pictures of him around the walls and details can be located on their website. Prior to the pub opening, it was the local Kwik Fit for many years.

<doc id="1235890" wikidata="Q852052" url="?curid=1235890" title="Cannone da 75/27 modello 11">
<text>The Cannone da 75/27 modello 11 was a French-designed field gun produced in Italy prior to World War I. It was introduced in 1912, designed by Joseph-Albert Deport. It was taken into service by Italy for use with its Alpine and cavalry troops going into World War I, and was built there in large numbers. The gun was designed with two notable features. It was the first artillery piece to introduce the split trail, as well as the last to utilize its novel dual-recoil system. The former became a very popular feature on artillery pieces through to the modern day. The later, while functional, did not get repeated. The dual-recoil system consisted of a small tubular recoil under the barrel which in turn traveled in a traditional rectangular cradle. This lessened heat transfer from the gun barrel to the recoil mechanism effectively, but was not necessary for the added complexity.

Some guns had two crew seats on the front of the gun shield.

The gun was used by the Italian army throughout World War I and remained on strength well into World War II. Many pieces even saw service with German forces fighting in Northern Italy from 1943 until the end of the war, as the &quot;7.5 cm Feldkanone 244(i)&quot;. Modello 11s were retired from active service in 1950.

One cannon was also sold to Finland in 1929 where it was designated as &quot;75 K 11&quot;.

<text>Jan Ellegaard Magnussen (born 4 July 1973) is a Danish professional racing driver and was a factory driver for General Motors until the end of the 2020 season. He has competed in Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART), NASCAR, the FIA Formula One World Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

==Career history==

===Lower series racing===

Born in Roskilde, Magnussen won the 1992 Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch, then dominated the 1994 British Formula 3 championship with Paul Stewart Racing, winning 14 of the 18 events and breaking Ayrton Senna&#x27;s F3 record.
Magnussen scored his first British F3 win that April at Donington Park, also taking pole for the race. He also won at Brands Hatch, twice at Silverstone, and at Thruxton. He won six of the first eight races. He then won again at Donington Park, and both season-ending rounds at Silverstone.

===Major series racing===
He made his Formula One debut at the 1995 Pacific Grand Prix in Aida, sitting in for Mika Häkkinen, who was unwell; becoming the first Danish to race in the category since Tom Belsø in 1974. In 1996 Magnussen drove in the CART series and International Touring Car Championship.

For 1997–1998 he had a seat in Formula One with the newly founded Stewart Grand Prix team, owned in part by his old F3 boss Paul Stewart. Team founder Jackie Stewart once described him as &quot;the most talented young driver to emerge since Ayrton Senna&quot;, but his performance was underwhelming. He scored his only championship point in his last race in F1, the 1998 Canadian Grand Prix; for the rest of the season he was replaced by Jos Verstappen. Magnussen started 24 GPs, one less than he entered, because his car was damaged in an accident during the start of the 1997 Brazilian Grand Prix causing him to retire before the restart.
In 1999 he participated in seven CART races. In 1999 and 2000 he raced in the American Le Mans Series with Panoz. 2001 he drove a Peugeot in Danish Touring Car series (DTC) and raced in eight ALMS races. 2002 he also raced for Peugeot in DTC and in ten ALMS races. Jan Magnussen won the 2008 GT1 and 2013 GT drivers&#x27; championships, both with Corvette Racing.

Magnussen has participated in various classes in the 24 hours of Le Mans every year since 1999. His best results so far are the victories in the GTS class in 2004 and GT1 class in 2005, 2006, and 2009, each time in a Chevrolet Corvette with Oliver Gavin and Olivier Beretta as teammates in 2005 and 2006, and Johnny O&#x27;Connell and Antonio García in 2009.

Also, Magnussen has participated in the 12 Hours of Sebring every year since 1999, winning the GT1 class in 2006, 2008, and 2009.

In 2005, Magnussen drove a Toyota Corolla in the Danish Touring Car Championship.

===Present day===
Magnussen was still an active driver, competing in the Danish Touring Car Championship (DTC) until 2010 and in a Chevrolet Corvette C7.R in the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship with Antonio Garcia as teammate until 2019 – and in the 24 hours of Le Mans. In the Danish Touring Car series he drove a Chevrolet Lacetti for Perfection Racing. He won the DTC in 2003 and 2008.
On 11 June 2010, it was announced that Magnussen would make his NASCAR Sprint Cup Series debut driving the No. 09 HendrickCars.com Chevrolet for Phoenix Racing at Infineon Raceway. After starting 32nd on the grid, he finished in 12th position.

On 14 June 2010, it was announced that Magnussen and Perfection Racing would not be participating in the DTC, leaving Magnussen and the team to focus on the Scandinavian Touring Car Cup&#x27;s remaining two rounds.

Magnussen drove the No. 57 Stevenson Motorsports Chevrolet Camaro with Robin Liddell and Andrew Davis in the 2010 GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series season opener, the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Following the Rolex 24, he moved to the team&#x27;s No. 97 car and competed in the majority of the races with Gunter Schaldach. Magnussen finished 24th in GT points and his best finish was second (Miller) with four top-10s.
On 7 November 2019, Magnussen was confirmed to drive in the inaugural TCR Denmark Touring Car Series for LM Racing in a VW Golf GTI TCR.

On 22 July 2023 he won Aurum 1006 km endurance race in Lithuania, driving a Mercedes-Benz AMG GT3 Evo.

On 16 September 2024 it was announced that Magnussen will take part in the Walter Hayes Trophy at Silverstone in November, driving a GT Motorsport-prepared Van Diemen RF78 in the same Duckhams colours that adorned his car at the 1992 Formula Ford Festival 

==Family==
Magnussen&#x27;s oldest son Kevin is also a racing driver currently competing in the FIA World Endurance Championship and IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship with BMW, having previously competed in Formula One with Haas, McLaren and Renault. Kevin mentioned that his father was his first hero when he was a child.

His nephew, Dennis Lind, and his youngest son, Luca, are also racing drivers.

<text>Hermano João &quot;Nano&quot; da Silva Ramos (born 7 December 1925) is a French-Brazilian former racing driver. He had a French mother and a Brazilian father.

== Career ==
Da Silva Ramos was born in Paris, France. He first ventured into motor racing, driving an MG TC, in March 1947, when at the age of 21, he competed in the Interlagos Grand Prix in Brazil. During 1953 he began racing an Aston Martin DB2/4 in sports car races in France. In 1954 at Montlhéry, he crossed the line in second place in the Paris Cup but was winner of the Coupe de Montlhery. In the same year, he also participated in the Le Mans 24 hour race, with Jean-Paul Colas as his co-driver, being forced to retire after 14 hours following a rear axle failure. Also in 1954, he ran out of fuel whilst leading the Tour de France Auto and retired with a damaged engine in the Rally of Morocco. Later in the year in the Salon Cup, in which he also had to retire, he drove a Gordini Type 18. In 1955 he (with co-driver Lucas) were disqualified for speeding in the Monte Carlo Rally, eventually classified 46th and 4th in class, won the Coupe de Montlhery again, won the Rally Sable-Solesmes and was 5th in the GT class of the Mille Miglia with co-driver Vidille.
Da Silva Ramos participated in seven Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 19 June 1955 and scoring a total of two championship points.

On the death of Kenneth McAlpine on 8 April 2023, da Silva Ramos became the oldest living former driver to have driven in a Formula One Grand Prix and on the death of Paul Goldsmith on 6 September 2024, he became the oldest living former driver to have driven in a round of the Formula One World Championship since Goldsmith competed in the 1958, 1959 and 1960 Indianapolis 500 races, which were rounds of the Formula One World Championship, but were not Formula One Grands Prix. Along with Argentine racing driver Carlo Tomasi, da Silva Ramos is one of the last living participants of 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans. In 2022 he participated as an expert in Emmanuel Reyé&#x27;s documentary movie &quot;Le Mans 55 : Une tragédie française&quot;.

<text>Clive Richard Hollick, Baron Hollick (born 20 May 1945) is a British businessman with media interests, and a supporter of the Labour Party.

== Early life and career ==
Hollick was born in Southampton, the son of Olive Mary (&quot;née&quot; Scruton) and Leslie George Hollick. He was educated at Taunton&#x27;s Grammar School, Southampton, and then studied Politics, Psychology, and Sociology at the University of Nottingham. He joined Hambros Bank as a graduate trainee in 1967 and rapidly gained a reputation as a financier and a dealmaker, in 1973 becoming the bank&#x27;s youngest-ever director.

== Vavasseur and MAI ==
The following year, Hollick became chief executive of JH Vavasseur Group, a failing money broker caught up in the 1973-4 secondary banking crisis. By 1978 the Vavasseur merchant bank was financially secure once again, and Hollick was building it into a successful media company, renaming the group Mills &amp; Allen International (MAI) after taking over advertising billboard company Mills and Allen. The group continued to grow with diversification during the 1980s, expanding into market research and business information services, and buying the National Opinion Polls (NOP) group in 1989 from the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust.

MAI moved into television in 1993, when its subsidiary Meridian Broadcasting won the ITV franchise for South and South East England. The following year it bought Anglia Television for £292m, and in 1995 a 14.8% share in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, and was a major shareholder in the consortium that was granted the franchise for Channel 5.

== United News and Media ==

In March 1996 the group merged with United Newspapers, publishers of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;Daily Star&quot;, and a string of local newspapers, to form United News &amp; Media, an international media group with revenues of £2.3 billion and 16,000 employees. Many thought Hollick would meet his match in Lord Stevens of Ludgate, proprietor of United; but it was Stevens who was sidelined as Hollick became chief executive, and within 18 months the &quot;Express&quot; had undergone a radical shift of political affiliation, dropping its long-standing support for the Conservative Party to become an enthusiastic proponent of Tony Blair&#x27;s New Labour.

UNM was required to sell its stake in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees as part of the merger, giving Granada control, but the next year it was permitted to add a third ITV franchise to its holdings, HTV, the broadcaster for Wales and the West Country. As ITV continued to consolidate, Hollick proposed to take over Carlton in 2000, which would have made him the dominant player on the network. But his plans were blocked by the then Secretary of State at the DTI, Stephen Byers, who ruled that the merger would only be acceptable if Hollick gave up the prized Meridian franchise – making the deal pointless. Unable to proceed, Hollick sold the three ITV franchises to Granada in July 2000 for £1.75 billion. The UNM share price dived 13% on the news, but history has since revealed that Hollick sold out right at the top of the market. Ironically, the last restrictions on ITV company joint ownership were lifted by the Communications Act 2003, and in February 2004 Granada and Carlton merged to form a single entity ITV plc controlling all of the ITV franchises in England and Wales.

Other parts of UNM were also disposed of advantageously, including the demerging of MAI&#x27;s original securities business in 1998 as Garban, which subsequently became ICAP; the sale in 1998 of United&#x27;s Provincial Newspapers including the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; to Johnston Press; the controversial sale of Express Newspapers in 2000 to Richard Desmond, then the owner of a number of pornographic magazines; the sale of the NOP World market research business to GfK in 2005; and the sale of United&#x27;s 35% stake in Channel 5 to RTL in 2005.

UNM, renamed United Business Media in 2000, is now strongly focussed on business-to-business publications, information services and exhibitions. Principal subsidiaries are PR Newswire, acquired by United in 1982, and CMP Media, acquired in 1999.

== Current activities and other interests ==
Hollick retired as CEO of United Business Media in April 2005 at the age of 60. He immediately became a managing partner at private equity firm KKR, focussing on the media and financial services sectors. This led to speculation that KKR might launch a bid for ITV. In 2006 he was appointed to the supervisory board of media conglomerate VNU, after KKR and Blackstone Group won a difficult takeover battle. He is also vice-chairman of the supervisory board of SBS Broadcasting Group, taken over by KKR and Permira in August 2005, into which in 2007 was merged the German satellite broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media. Hollick is also a director of Diageo (since 2001), and Honeywell International (since 2003).

Other directorships Hollick has held include Hambros Bank, 1973–96; Shepperton Studios (chairman), 1976–79; National Bus Company, 1984–91; Department of Applied Economics, Cambridge University, 1988–95; Logica, 1987–92; British Aerospace, 1992–97. From 2002 to 2008 he was Chairman of the South Bank Centre arts complex in London. He is currently a member of investment bank Jefferies Global Senior Advisory Board.

Hollick has been a longtime supporter and donor to the Labour Party, and was one of the founding backers of the New Labour think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). For a time after the 1997 election, he served as a special advisor to Margaret Beckett and Peter Mandelson at the Department of Trade and Industry. Hollick is a supporter of the 2020 Vision political campaign run by Charles Clarke and Alan Milburn, and currently co-ordinating funds for the campaign. He is a former Patron of Prisoners Abroad, a charity that supports the welfare of Britons imprisoned overseas and their families.

Hollick has been a partner at the leading European technology and media investment bank GP Bullhound since 2010.

Horllick is a senior advisor at London based venture firm Hambro Perks.

==Personal life==
He was created a life peer on 20 June 1991, as Baron Hollick, of Notting Hill in the Royal Borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea. He is married to Sue Woodford-Hollick and has three daughters.

<doc id="1235913" wikidata="Q127922" url="?curid=1235913" title="Radiative zone">
<text>A radiative zone is a layer of a star&#x27;s interior where energy is primarily transported toward the exterior by means of radiative diffusion and thermal conduction, rather than by convection. Energy travels through the radiative zone in the form of electromagnetic radiation as photons.

Matter in a radiative zone is so dense that photons can travel only a short distance before they are absorbed or scattered by another particle, gradually shifting to longer wavelength as they do so. For this reason, it takes an average of 171,000 years for gamma rays from the core of the Sun to leave the radiative zone. Over this range, the temperature of the plasma drops from 15 million K near the core down to 1.5 million K at the base of the convection zone.

==Temperature gradient==
In a radiative zone, the temperature gradient—the change in temperature (&quot;T&quot;) as a function of radius (&quot;r&quot;)—is given by:

: formula_1

where &quot;κ&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is the opacity, &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is the matter density, &quot;L&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is the luminosity, and &quot;σ&quot;&quot;B&quot; is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. Hence the opacity (&quot;κ&quot;) and radiation flux (&quot;L&quot;) within a given layer of a star are important factors in determining how effective radiative diffusion is at transporting energy. A high opacity or high luminosity can cause a high temperature gradient, which results from a slow flow of energy. Those layers where convection is more effective than radiative diffusion at transporting energy, thereby creating a lower temperature gradient, will become convection zones.

This relation can be derived by integrating Fick&#x27;s first law over the surface of some radius &quot;r&quot;, giving the total outgoing energy flux which is equal to the luminosity by conservation of energy:
::formula_2
Where &quot;D&quot; is the photons diffusion coefficient, and &quot;u&quot; is the energy density.

The energy density is related to the temperature by Stefan–Boltzmann law by:
::formula_3

Finally, as in the elementary theory of diffusion coefficient in gases, the diffusion coefficient &quot;D&quot; approximately satisfies:
::formula_4
where λ is the photon mean free path, and is the reciprocal of the opacity &quot;κ&quot;.

==Eddington stellar model==
Eddington assumed the pressure &quot;P&quot; in a star is a combination of an ideal gas pressure and radiation pressure, and that there is a constant ratio, β, of the gas pressure to the total pressure.
Therefore, by the ideal gas law:
::formula_5
where &quot;k&quot;&quot;B&quot; is Boltzmann constant and μ the mass of a single atom (actually, an ion since matter is ionized; usually a hydrogen ion, i.e. a proton).
While the radiation pressure satisfies:
:formula_6
so that &quot;T&quot;4 is proportional to &quot;P&quot; throughout the star.

This gives the polytropic equation (with &quot;n&quot;=3):
::formula_7

Using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, the second equation becomes equivalent to:
::formula_8
For energy transmission by radiation only, we may use the equation for the temperature gradient (presented in the previous subsection) for the right-hand side and get
::formula_9

Thus the Eddington model is a good approximation in the radiative zone as long as κ&quot;L&quot;/&quot;M&quot; is approximately constant, which is often the case.

==Stability against convection==

The radiation zone is stable against formation of convection cells if the density gradient is high enough, so that an element moving upwards has its density lowered (due to adiabatic expansion) less than the drop in density of its surrounding, so that it will experience a net buoyancy force downwards.

The criterion for this is:
::formula_10
where &quot;P&quot; is the pressure, ρ the density and formula_11 is the heat capacity ratio.

For a homogenic ideal gas, this is equivalent to:
::formula_12

We can calculate the left-hand side by dividing the equation for the temperature gradient by the equation relating the pressure gradient to the gravity acceleration &quot;g&quot;:

: formula_13
&quot;M&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) being the mass within the sphere of radius &quot;r&quot;, and is approximately the whole star mass for large enough &quot;r&quot;.

This gives the following form of the Schwarzschild criterion for stability against convection:
::formula_14
Note that for non-homogenic gas this criterion should be replaced by the Ledoux criterion, because the density gradient now also depends on concentration gradients.

For a polytrope solution with &quot;n&quot;=3 (as in the Eddington stellar model for radiative zone), &quot;P&quot; is proportional to &quot;T&quot;4 and the left-hand side is constant and equals 1/4, smaller than the ideal monatomic gas approximation for the right-hand side giving formula_15. This explains the stability of the radiative zone against convection.

However, at a large enough radius, the opacity κ increases due to the decrease in temperature (by Kramers&#x27; opacity law), and possibly also due to a smaller degree of ionization in the lower shells of heavy elements ions. This leads to a violation of the stability criterion and to the creation of the convection zone; in the sun, opacity increases by more than a tenfold across the radiative zone, before the transition to the convection zone happens.

Additional situations in which this stability criterion is not met are:
*Large values of formula_16, which may happen towards the star core&#x27;s center, where &quot;M&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is small, if nuclear energy production is strongly peaked at the center, as in relatively massive stars. Thus such stars have a convective core.
*A smaller value of formula_11. For semi-ionized gas, where approximately half of the atoms are ionized, the effective value of formula_11 drops to 6/5, giving formula_19. Therefore, all stars have shallow convection zones near their surfaces, at low enough temperatures where ionization is only partial.

==Main sequence stars==
For main sequence stars—those stars that are generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at the core, the presence and location of radiative regions depends on the star&#x27;s mass. Main sequence stars below about 0.3 solar masses are entirely convective, meaning they do not have a radiative zone. From 0.3 to 1.2 solar masses, the region around the stellar core is a radiative zone, separated from the overlying convection zone by the tachocline. The radius of the radiative zone increases monotonically with mass, with stars around 1.2 solar masses being almost entirely radiative. Above 1.2 solar masses, the core region becomes a convection zone and the overlying region is a radiative zone, with the amount of mass within the convective zone increasing with the mass of the star.

==The Sun==
In the Sun, the region between the solar core at 0.2 of the Sun&#x27;s radius and the outer convection zone at 0.71 of the Sun&#x27;s radius is referred to as the radiation zone, although the core is also a radiative region. The convection zone and the radiative zone are divided by the tachocline, another part of the Sun.

<text>Rum balls are a truffle-like confectionery cake of cookie butter flavoured with chocolate and rum. They are roughly the size of a golf ball and often coated in chocolate sprinkles, desiccated coconut, or cocoa. As their name implies, these treats contain rum. Because they are not baked, the alcohol flavour and kick are not neutralized during preparation. Rum balls are especially popular during the holiday season.
Rum balls are a popular Christmas treat in England, Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, the United States, Austria, Slovenia, Hungary, Greece and the Czech Republic. In Denmark they are enjoyed year round and known as either &quot;romkugle&quot;, &quot;trøffel&quot; or &quot;sputnik&quot;, depending on the specific region. In Poland, also not necessarily associated with Christmas, the rum ball is known as &quot;bajadera&quot; (not to be confused with a Croatian confection of the same name).

There are many different ways to make rum balls, as recipes vary from region to region and family to family. All rum balls must include chocolate and rum, but the rest of the ingredients vary in kind, form, and amount.

To make rum balls, the cake (or biscuit) material is crushed and mixed with fat, cocoa and a moist binding ingredient, such as jam or condensed milk. Other optional ingredients can also be added, such as nuts. When the mixture holds together firmly, it is rolled into balls and then coated.

In Hungary they are made in a similar way, but usually rolled in sugar. Ground walnut and raisins are sometimes added to the rum ball ingredients. Some Hungarian rum balls are made with whole cherries placed inside the balls, and then rolled in coconut flakes ().

Rum balls closely resemble brigadeiros, a Brazilian sweet; however, brigadeiros are made from condensed milk.

The world&#x27;s largest rum ball was created in Mejdal, Denmark on 11 June 2017, weighing .

<text>Johnny Alberto Cecotto Persello (born 25 January 1956), better known as Johnny Cecotto, is a Venezuelan former professional Grand Prix motorcycle racer and auto racer. He rose to prominence as a teenage prodigy in 1975 when he became the youngest motorcycle road racing world champion at the age of 19. Despite the auspicious beginning to his motorcycle racing career, he suffered numerous injuries and mechanical problems which curtailed his success in motorcycle Grand Prix racing.

At the age of 24, Cecotto turned his attention to auto racing where he reached the pinnacle of the sport as a Formula One driver. He later became a successful Touring Car racer. He is the last of a select group of competitors who competed at the highest level in motorcycle and auto racing, which includes John Surtees and Mike Hailwood among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://8w.forix.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motorcycle racing history==
===Early career===
Cecotto was born in Caracas, Venezuela to Italian immigrant parents. His father was a motorcycle shop owner and former motorcycle racer who had won the Venezuelan national championship on a 500cc Norton. He followed his father&#x27;s career path and began motorcycle racing at a young age, first competing on a Honda CB750 and a Kawasaki triple before gaining the support of the Venezuelan Yamaha importer. 

Cecotto rode a Yamaha TZ350 to win the 1973 Venezuelan road racing national championship at the age of 17. After the death of Jarno Saarinen at the 1973 Nations Grand Prix, Cecotto adopted a new helmet color scheme with two pointed red stripes that was based on Saarinen&#x27;s helmet colors, in honor of the fallen rider. He would keep the helmet design through the remainder of his career.

Cecotto successfully defended his title by reclaiming the Venezuelan national championship in 1974, and also won the 1974 South American motorcycle road racing championship, a one-race event held at the Interlagos Circuit near São Paulo, Brazil. In his first international racing outside of South America, he finished 35th overall at the Daytona 200 on a Yamaha 350cc, and suffered a mechanical failure after only 5 laps at the Imola 200.

===Daytona success===
Cecotto rose to international prominence at the 1975 Daytona 200 motorcycle race with one of the more inspired rides in the history of the event. At the time, the Daytona 200 was considered one of the most prestigious motorcycle races in the world, attracting world champions such as Giacomo Agostini and Barry Sheene. He arrived at Daytona as an unknown rookie aboard an unmodified Yamaha TZ750 sponsored by Venemotos, Yamaha&#x27;s Venezuelan importer.

The unheralded teenager promptly raised his profile by qualifying on the front row shared with pole-sitter Kenny Roberts, Gene Romero, Teuvo Lansivuori and Steve Baker. As Cecotto took his place on the starting grid, race officials noticed a puddle of fluid developing beneath his motorcycle. With the start of the race just moments away, the officials made the decision to remove Cecotto and his motorcycle from the grid for safety reasons. As the race was started without Cecotto, officials discovered that the fluid was only water overflowing from the radiator and posed no safety hazard.

Officials allowed Cecotto re-enter the race however, by then he was in last place. With an impressive display of riding ability, Cecotto passed half the field of competitors on the first lap alone. Two laps later, he was up to 26th place. By the fifth lap he was in 18th place and by the end of the tenth lap he was in tenth place. On the 50th lap, he caught and passed Agostini for third place before his motorcycle began to overheat, forcing him to reduce his pace and settle for a third place behind the eventual winner Gene Romero and second place Steve Baker. On the event of the 50th anniversary of the Daytona 200 in 1991, the American Motorcyclist Association convened a panel of motorcycling press and former racers, who named Cecotto&#x27;s accomplishment as the top performance in the first 50 years of the race.

===World champion===
One month after his Daytona performance, Cecotto traveled to Europe where he continued his meteoric rise with a victory at the prestigious Imola 200 F750-championship race after Agostini&#x27;s engine seized while American champion Kenny Roberts withdrew due to a wrist injury.

Cecotto continued his impressive streak by scoring a double victory in the first world championship Grand Prix race of his career. At the season opening French Grand Prix held at the Paul Ricard Circuit, he set the fastest lap time en route to winning the 250cc race and, followed that performance by leading the 350cc race from start to finish to win by a 25-second margin over the seven-time 350cc world champion Agostini. He had originally planned to compete in two or three European events but, after his performance at the French Grand Prix, he gained full sponsorship for the remainder of the season aboard an ex-Agostini TZ350. He went on to win three more races and defeated Agostini, for the 350cc World Championship. At the age of nineteen, he was the youngest ever world champion until Loris Capirossi won the 1990 125cc world championship at the age of 17. He was competitive in the 250cc world championship with two victories however, a crash at the German Grand Prix and then engine problems for his motorcycle left him in fourth place in the final standings.

===Later career===

In 1976, Cecotto returned to the Daytona 200, now with full support from the Yamaha factory racing team. The race turned into a battle between Cecotto and his Yamaha teammate, Kenny Roberts. Their grueling pace proved too much for their tires and on the 33rd of the 52 laps Roberts slowed with a worn rear tire. Nine laps from the end, Roberts&#x27; tire blew apart, almost making him lose control before he limped back into the pits. Cecotto&#x27;s pit crew attempted to wave him into the pits with three laps remaining to check on his tire but, he ignored their signal and continued on to win the race. Afterwards, his shredded tires showed how close he was to suffering the same fate as Roberts.
Cecotto moved up to the premier 500cc class riding a year-old Yamaha YZR500 for a Yamaha-supported satellite team operated under the Venemotos team banner. Suzuki&#x27;s Barry Sheene was expected to be his main competitor for the 1976 world championship. He began the season with a promising second-place finish behind Sheene at the season-opening French Grand Prix however, Cecotto struggled to come to grips with the Yamaha, falling 13 times in subsequent races. He failed to score any further points after the French round and shortly after the Italian Grand Prix, he gave up on the 500cc class completely to concentrate on defending his 350cc title. He finished the 500cc season in a disappointing 20th place as Sheene won the 500cc world championship. He also lost his 350cc crown in a tight battle with Harley-Davidson mounted Walter Villa.

While Cecotto possessed a natural riding ability, some observers speculated that he had won too early in his career without fully understanding how he had accomplished it. Yamaha Team Manager and former world champion Rod Gould said, &quot;I think Cecotto was going fast and didn&#x27;t really know why. Now he doesn&#x27;t know why he&#x27;s going slower and crashing.&quot; Cecotto&#x27;s results were also affected by the Venemotos team&#x27;s disorganization and lack of preparation. According to his Yamaha factory mechanic Vince French, on several occasions, the team failed to file official race entry forms or failed to secure garage space thus delaying vital practice time. On other occasions, the team failed to provide equipment required by race organizers causing further delays.
At the beginning of the 1977 season, Cecotto was badly injured in a deadly four rider accident at the Austrian Grand Prix that claimed the life of Swiss rider Hans Stadelmann. He recovered from his injuries in time for the Swedish Grand Prix where he finished in second place, 2.9 seconds behind winner Barry Sheene. Cecotto then won two consecutive races with victories at the Finnish Grand Prix and the Czechoslovak Grand Prix where he also won the 350cc Grand Prix. Despite missing most of the season due to injuries, he still ranked fourth in the final championship standings.

Cecotto began the 1978 season by winning the Imola 200 for a second time but, he faced a new rival for the world championship with the arrival of Kenny Roberts. Although he scored four podium finishes including a narrow victory by 1/10ths of a second over Roberts at the 1978 Dutch TT, he failed to score consistent results and suffered four mechanical failures, as Roberts won the world championship ahead of Sheene and the third placed Cecotto. He was more successful in the 1978 Formula 750 world championship, where despite four victories by Roberts, Cecotto was able to score three victories along with three second-place finishes to secure the championship.

Cecotto suffered a badly broken kneecap at the 1979 Austrian Grand Prix at the Salzburgring and missed half the season due to his injuries. He rejoined the championship for the final four races but, with his injuries still causing him pain, he failed to score consistent results as, Roberts won his second consecutive 500cc world championship. Although he won 5 races in the 1979 Formula 750 world championship, his inconsistent results relegated him to third place in the final standings.

As a result of Roberts&#x27; success for the Yamaha team along with Cecotto&#x27;s inconsistent performances, Yamaha withdrew their factory support for him after the 1979 season. He went into the 1980 season competing as a privateer aboard a Bimota chassis powered by a Yamaha engine in the 350cc class and a production Yamaha in the 500cc class. He began the year with a victory at the 1980 Imola 200, joining Kenny Roberts as three-time winners of the event. His world championship campaign started on a positive note when, he scored a victory at the season opening 350cc French Grand Prix along with a fourth-place finish in the 500cc race however, after his initial success his motorcycles suffered numerous mechanical failures and, he could do no better than a fourth-place finish in the 350cc championship along with a seventh place in the 500cc championship. After the 1980 season, he decided to quit motorcycle racing at the age of 24 to pursue an auto racing career. He retired with twelve 500cc pole positions in 28 starts, giving him one of the highest pole position per start ratios in motorcycle Grand Prix history.

==Automobile racing history==
===Formula racing===

Cecotto made his four-wheeled debut with Minardi in the Formula Two Championship. In the Formula Two season, driving for the March-BMW team, he won three races and finished the season tied for first place with his teammate Corrado Fabi, but was relegated to runner up by the tie breaker system. Nevertheless, his performance garnered enough attention that he was offered a seat in Formula One.

In Formula One, Cecotto participated in 23 races, debuting on March 13, 1983 for the Theodore Racing team. He had a promising start as he scored a sixth place in only his second race; however, the team suffered from lack of funding and he was forced to sit out the final two rounds. For the 1984 season, he joined the Toleman racing team with Ayrton Senna as his team mate. While qualifying for the British Grand Prix, he crashed heavily at Westfield,
breaking both of his legs, which effectively ended his Formula One career. His sixth place at Long Beach stood as the best result for a Venezuelan driver until Pastor Maldonado&#x27;s victory in the Spanish Grand Prix 29 years later.

===Touring cars===

After recovering from his injuries, Cecotto returned to competition in the flourishing Group A Touring Car category for the famed Schnitzer Motorsport BMW team, with his best finish being 2nd at the 1985 Spa 24 Hours with Dieter Quester and Markus Oestreich. He then traveled to Australia where he finished second in the 1985 James Hardie 1000 at the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, driving the BMW 635 CSi he drove at Spa, jointly winning the races &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; award with his co-driver Roberto Ravaglia. During practice for the James Hardie, Cecotto professed surprise when told by former motorcycle racing rival Gregg Hansford, who was driving an Alfa Romeo GTV6 in the race, that they raced motorcycles at Mt Panorama as well as cars, claiming that he would think twice before racing a bike there (Hansford was at the time the 350cc motorcycle lap record holder for the 6.172 km (3.835 mi) circuit).

In 1986 he joined Belgian based factory backed RAS Sport Volvo team in the renamed (for 1986 only) FIA Touring Car Championship driving a turbocharged Volvo 240T. Usually co-driving with defending European Touring Car Champion Thomas Lindström, Cecotto finished 8th in the championship with two wins (Hockenheim and Zolder), two second and two third placings. He also drove a 240T to victory at the 1986 Guia Race held during the Macau Grand Prix, as well as winning the 1986 InterTEC 500 held at Fuji in Japan alongside Swedish driver and Volvo team mate Anders Olofsson..

After Volvo pulled out at the end of the 1986 season, Cecotto re-joined BMW and competed in the 1987 World Touring Car Championship driving a BMW M3 for the Italian CiBiEmme team alongside joint 1985 ETCC champion Gianfranco Brancatelli. The pair won the third round of the championship, the 500 km de Bourgogne at Dijon-Prenois, before being the first WTCC registered car to finish the first Australian round, the 1987 James Hardie 1000. Although Cecotto and Brancatelli only finished in 7th place at Bathurst, as the first registered car to finish they were awarded first place points. In 1989 he captured the Italian Touring Car Championship. Cecotto finished in 8th place with Brancatelli in the 1987 World Touring Car Championship with 158 points.

From 1988 to 1992, Cecotto competed in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM, German Touring Car Championship). Driving a Schnitzer Motorsport BMW M3, he finished as runner up in the 1990 season. He also participated in endurance racing, winning the 1990 24 Hours of Spa and the 1992 24 Hours of Nürburgring. In 1994 and 1998 he won the German Super Tourenwagen Cup Championship for BMW. In 1995 he raced in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) for BMW. In 2001 and 2002, he switched to the Irmscher Opel Omega and won the German V8Star Series Championship two years running.

==Later life==
Cecotto currently devotes most of his time to supporting the professional auto racing career of his sons, Johnny Cecotto Jr. and Jonathan Cecotto.

<text>Julian Terence Bailey (born 9 October 1961) is a British former Formula One driver from England, who raced for the Tyrrell and Lotus teams.

==Racing career==
Although born in the United Kingdom, Bailey was raised in Menorca, Spain. He became an accomplished Formula Ford 1600 racer in Britain, winning the important Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch. In 1987 he got his chance to race in Formula 3000, in a GA Motorsport Lola, in which he won in only his third Formula 3000 race, becoming the first British driver to win a race in the formula. This attracted the attention of Ken Tyrrell, and Bailey was recruited to drive for the Formula One team the following year. The car was very uncompetitive and he did not score a single point, while his teammate Jonathan Palmer scored five. In 1989 he joined the Nissan sports car factory team, and tried to get back into Formula One in 1991 with Lotus. He finished sixth in the San Marino Grand Prix but didn’t retain his drive after Monaco. During his Formula One career he was entered in 20 Grands Prix, qualifying for seven at a time when the grids were over-subscribed, and scored a total of one championship point.

In 1992 Bailey joined the Toyota BTCC team, and the following season, he finished fifth in the championship, although his season is best remembered for his collision with teammate Will Hoy at Silverstone, which flipped Hoy’s car onto its roof leading BBC commentator Murray Walker to quip “The car upside down is a Toyota!” (a play on the company’s UK advertising slogan “The car in front is a Toyota”). In the following round at Knockhill, he took his one and only BTCC win. The next two seasons were less successful, although he outscored 1991 champion Hoy in both their seasons as teammates. Toyota withdrew from the BTCC as a works team at the end of 1995, but Bailey was still contracted to them. For 1996, Bailey competed in the South African Touring Car Championship (SATCC) for Minolta Toyota. He has raced primarily in sports cars since. For 1997, Bailey joined Lister, eventually winning the British GT Championship in 1999 and the FIA GT Championship in 2000 in a Lister Storm.

==Personal life==
Bailey’s stepson, Jack Clarke, is also a racing driver with experience in Formula BMW and Formula Palmer Audi. In 2009 he graduated to the FIA Formula Two Championship, and in 2014 moved to the British Touring Car Championship.

===Post-racing career===
In 2008, he joined with ESPN STAR Sports as a guest commentator for a number of Formula One races.

===’’Top Gear’’===
On the show ‘’Top Gear‘’, he was one of several drivers to appear as The Stig.

<text>Frederick Charles Kenneth Wharton (21 March 1916 – 12 January 1957) was a British racing driver from Smethwick, England. He competed in off-road trials, hillclimbs, and rallying, and also raced sports cars and single-seaters. He began racing in the new National 500cc Formula in his own special, and later acquired a Cooper. His World Championship Grand Prix debut was at the 1952 Swiss event, run to Formula 2 regulations, where he started from 13th position on the grid and finished 4th. He participated in a total of 15 World Championship Grands Prix, from which he scored three championship points.

On 17 August 1935, he was involved in a crash at Donington Park while driving an Austin in an 850 c.c. race. The incident, which saw him overturn at Red-gate corner occurred on lap one of five. Wharton escaped with abrasions to the arm.

In 1951 he &quot;travelled abroad, with Peter Bell&#x27;s 2-litre E.R.A., to finish 3rd overall in the Susa/Mont Cenis hill-climb and 4th overall in the Aosta/Grand Saint Bernard hill-climb. With a Cooper 500, he also competed in the German Freiburg hill-climb where he was runner-up in the 500 cc class to Stirling Moss.&quot; Wharton won the Freiburg event outright in the E.R.A. on 5 August, climbing the 7.4 miles of the Schauinsland Pass, in 8 minutes 5.33 seconds. On 19 August he was fastest at the Vue des Alpes hill-climb, with a time of 3 minutes 57.8 seconds. He won the British Hill Climb Championship every year from 1951 to 1954, and remains the only driver to have won four successive BHCC titles. Other successes with ERA R4D included winning the Brighton Speed Trials in 1954, 1955 and 1956.

Success in rallies included winning the Tulip Rally in 1949, 1950 and 1952, driving Fords. He also became the British Trials Champion.

On 4 July 1954, he and Peter Whitehead won the Reims 12-hour race in a Jaguar D-Type.

In 1957 Wharton was fatally injured when his Ferrari Monza crashed in a sports-car race at the Ardmore Circuit in Auckland, New Zealand. More than 1,100 people attended his funeral, including his mother, father, sister, aunt, uncle and cousins.

<doc id="1235922" wikidata="Q171569" url="?curid=1235922" title="Lella Lombardi">
<text>Maria Grazia &quot;Lella&quot; Lombardi (26 March 1941 – 3 March 1992) was an Italian racing driver who participated in 17 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix. Lombardi is one of two female drivers to qualify for Formula One and is the only female driver who scored points in Formula One.

Lombardi grew up in Italy and developed an interest in racing by driving a delivery van for her family. Starting in karting and moving to Formula Monza and Formula Three, Lombardi advanced through racing until she reached Formula One. She is the only woman to win points in Formula One, winning half a point in the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix. Lombardi was also the first woman to qualify and compete in the Race of Champions at Brands Hatch and raced in sports cars. She won the 6 Hours of Pergusa and the 6 Hours of Vallelunga.

Lombardi&#x27;s story has impacted generations of racers. Her experience has shaped the involvement of women in racing and how people perceive women in the racing industry.

== Personal life ==
Lombardi was born in Frugarolo, a small town in Piedmont in Italy. Her father was a butcher, who gave Lella her first job as a delivery driver for the family&#x27;s shop. At first, Lombardi’s father found her passion for racing hard to accept but embraced it once she finished runner-up in a 1968 race. Lella Lombardi was also one of the first female racers in a same-sex relationship. Lombardi died of breast cancer in Milan on 3 March 1992. She was 50 years old and was buried in Frugarolo. She was survived by her partner, Fiorenza. Lombardi is commemorated by a sculpture in her birthplace, Frugarolo.

==Career==
===Formula One===
After a brief experience with karting as a child, Lombardi bought her first car in 1965, racing in Formula Monza. She moved on to Formula Three in 1968. In 1974, Lombardi was signed to drive the Shellsport-Luxembourg Lola in Formula 5000 and finished fourth. Initially, Lombardi tried to qualify for Formula One with a privately entered Brabham supported by the Italian Automobile Club but failed to qualify. That winter, she met an Italian nobleman, Count Vittorio Zanon, who sponsored her entrance into F1. In 1975, Lombardi was invited to join Vittorio Brambilla and Hans-Joachim Stuck on the March engineering team, racing the full season with Zanon&#x27;s Lavazza Coffee Company’s sponsorship. At the opening race of the campaign in South Africa, Lombardi became the first woman, since Maria Teresa de Filippis in 1958, to successfully qualify for a Grand Prix. 1975 would prove to be an eventful season for the March Team, as Lombardi scored half a Championship point in the Spanish Grand Prix. This was because the race only lasted 23 laps until Lombardi was forced to retire with a fuel system problem, while the race suffered a major tragedy when the rear wing on Rolf Stommelen&#x27;s Embassy Hill broke, sending him into the barrier. While trying to avoid Stommelen as he crossed the track, Carlos Pace crashed, and five spectators were killed by Stommelen&#x27;s flying car. The race continued for another four laps, resulting in Lombardi’s sixth-place finish and, with the race being stopped before three-fourths of the scheduled race distance was reached, all points were halved. Lombardi also successfully performed at other races, including the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, where she finished seventh. At the United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, Lombardi had a one-off drive for Williams. However, she was prevented from starting due to an ignition problem.

In 1976, Lombardi was confirmed at March Engineering alongside Brambilla and Stuck. She finished 14th at the Brazilian Grand Prix that year, and subsequently, the team decided to replace her with Ronnie Peterson. Then, Lombardi briefly moved to RAM Racing, her best result being 12th at the Austrian Grand Prix.

===Race of Champions===
In 1974, Lombardi was the first female racing driver to qualify and compete at the Race of Champions in Brands Hatch. She raced a Lola-Chevrolet and finished 14th. In the 1975 event, she was once again able to qualify and compete with a March-Ford. She retired after 20 laps.

===Sports cars===
Lombardi later raced in sports cars. In 1979, she won the 6 Hours of Pergusa and the 6 Hours of Vallelunga. She also competed four times at the 24 hours of Le Mans, where she finished 20th in 1976 in a Lancia Stratos Turbo.

Lombardi had also raced in the Firecracker 400 NASCAR race at the Daytona International Speedway in 1977. There were two other female drivers in the field: American Janet Guthrie and Belgian Christine Beckers. Lombardi finished 31st.

Lombardi retired from racing in 1988. In 1989, she founded her own racing team, Lombardi Autosport.

== Legacy ==
Lella Lombardi’s racing career has influenced the perceptions of subsequent generations of women in racing. Lombardi is considered an F1 trailblazer, after which women increasingly joined Formula One in many capacities aside from driving. According to &quot;The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today&#x27;s World,&quot; because of Lella Lombardi, there are more women involved in other aspects of Formula One, especially &quot;traditionally female&quot; jobs such as modeling. Lombardi is also used as one of the reference points for women in racing. Journalist Phil Pash reports that though Lombardi viewed racing as a masculine sport, she succeeded regardless because of her &#x27;competitive spirit.&#x27; Among others who comment on the effects of Lombardi’s legacy is Matt Majendie, who writes about Jamie Chadwick. Chadwick argues that for women entering Formula One in 2022, financial support is a greater obstacle than gender. Majendie argues this by citing Lombardi’s example as a racer, who despite her gender, successfully entered Formula One. This need for financial support is combated by the rise of the W-series, which started in October 2018. The W-series is a women’s racing championship, which eliminates financial barriers, and gives equal opportunity to female racers. As an example of successful women produced by Formula One, Lombardi is credited with making Formula One accessible to women.

<text>Neville Lederle (25 September 1938 – 17 May 2019) was a racing driver from South Africa. He participated in two World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, scoring a single championship point.

==Early life==
Lederle was born in Theunissen, Orange Free State and schooled at St Andrews in Bloemfontein.

==Formula One career==
Starting out in Formula One with his Ford-engined Lotus 18 in 1961, he retired from the Rand Grand Prix and only managed 14th in the Cape Grand Prix in January 1962. Later that year, however, he acquired a Lotus 21 with a Climax engine and came fifth in the 1962 Rand Grand Prix and fourth in the Natal Grand Prix. This form led him to a sixth place in the World Championship South African Grand Prix and thus a World Championship point in his first event at that level.

In 1963 Lederle broke a leg in practice for the Rand 9 Hours sports car race and missed a large part of the 1964 season whilst recovering. He returned with his Lotus 21 for the end-of-season 1964 Rand Grand Prix where he finished 10th, but he narrowly failed to qualify for January&#x27;s 1965 South African Grand Prix. After this disappointment, Lederle effectively retired from racing to concentrate on business interests, which included a Volkswagen dealership.

==Death==
Lederle died at his home in Knysna on 17 May 2019.

<doc id="1235932" wikidata="Q171994" url="?curid=1235932" title="Philippe Étancelin">
<text>Philippe Jean Armand Étancelin (28 December 1896 – 13 October 1981) was a French racing driver, and a winner of the 1934 24 Hours of Le Mans. He competed primarily on the Grand Prix circuit, and was an early Formula One driver.

== Biography ==

Born in Rouen, Seine-Inférieure, in Normandy, Étancelin worked as a merchant in the winter and raced cars during the summer.

Étancelin&#x27;s wife, Suzanne, served as his crew chief. Their three children were placed in a school in Rouen while the couple traveled to races around the world. Suzanne communicated with Étancelin through French sign language as he raced around the speedway. Suzanne told a reporter Étancelin bought a racing car to celebrate the birth of their second child, Jeanne Alice. He did not intend to race the car but merely use it for pleasure driving around the countryside. The couple once drove it up to a speed of . After two years of recreational motoring, Étancelin decided to enter a race.

Étancelin began racing a privateer Bugatti in 1926, entering local events and hillclimbs. His first victory was the &quot;Grand Prix de la Marne&quot; at Reims in 1927, the same year he recorded a third at the &quot;Coppa Florio&quot; in Saint-Brieuc. He repeated his victory at Reims in 1929, ahead of Zenelli and friend Marcel Lehoux, making a Bugatti sweep of the podium. Étancelin took a victory at the &quot;Grand Prix de la Baule&quot; and the Antibes &quot;Prix de Conseil General&quot;.

Nicknamed &quot;Phi Phi&quot;, Étancelin also earned Bugatti a win at the 1930 Algerian Grand Prix, followed home by Lehoux. At the &quot;Formula Libre&quot; French Grand Prix, he defeated Henry Birkin&#x27;s Bentley, and won the Grenoble &quot;Circuit de Dauphine&quot;, with a third at Lyons.

Étancelin began the 1931 season in a Bugatti, placing behind Czaykowski at the Casablanca Grand Prix at Anfa. He won the &quot;Circuit d&#x27;Esterel Plage&quot; at Saint-Raphaël. For major events, run to &quot;Formula Libre&quot; rules to a 10-hour duration, he shared with Lehoux. They dropped out of both the Italian and French &quot;Grands Prix&quot;. After Étancelin switched to Alfa later in the year, he came fourth in the Marne &quot;Grand Prix&quot; and won the four-hour Dieppe Grand Prix, ahead of Czaykowski&#x27;s Bugatti and Earl Howe&#x27;s Delage. He added wins at Grenoble and the Comminges Grand Prix at St. Gaudens.

While Étancelin was a top privateer, he was consistently beaten by works teams in 1932, earning only one win, the Picardy Grand Prix at Peronne.

In 1933, Étancelin&#x27;s Alfa narrowly lost the 19th annual French &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (organized by the French Automobile Club at the Montlhery Autodrome near Paris) following a &quot;furious&quot; contest with Giuseppe Campari&#x27;s Maserati, losing the lead on the final lap of the event. Nevertheless, Étancelin won a second consecutive Picardy &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, over a &quot;formidable&quot; Raymond Sommer, and placed second to an equally formidable Tazio Nuvolari at the Nîmes Grand Prix, with win over Jean-Pierre Wimille at the Marne &quot;Grand Prix&quot;.

The new 750 kilogram formula brought the conquering Silver Arrows of Mercedes and Auto Union. Étancelin switched to a Maserati 8CM, earning second places at Casablanca, Montreux, and Nice, with a win at Dieppe. He shared an Alfa with Luigi Chinetti to win Le Mans.

Étancelin&#x27;s 1935 season was no better, with only a third at Tunis. He gave Rudolf Caracciola&#x27;s Mercedes a tough fight at Monaco in the little 3.7 litre Maserati, but suffered brake fade and came fourth. Driving a Maserati for the Subalpina team, he also had a spectacular accident at the Swiss Grand Prix in Bern, with his car upturned and in flames, but he did not suffer injuries.

Entering one of the new 4.4 liter Maseratis in 1936, he was outmatched by the German entrants, suffering retirements in nearly every contest. He won only the Pau &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, and that was &quot;against modest opposition&quot;. He negotiated the 100 laps in 3 hours 21 minutes 22 seconds. In October, Étancelin qualified sixth for the Vanderbilt Cup, which was run over near Westbury, New York, after a qualifier at Roosevelt Raceway in Long Island. He finished the AAA-sanctioned race in ninth.

Étancelin stayed out of racing in 1937, returning in 1938 solely to share a new Talbot with Chinetti at LeMans, but did not score a win. For 1939, he put his Talbot third at Pau, following Hermann Lang and Manfred von Brauchitsch home. He also scored a fourth place at the French &quot;Grand Prix&quot;.

Étancelin would enter the first motor race held in France postwar, failing to finish at the Bois de Boulogne in an Alfa. He was not able to obtain one of the scarce new racers until 1948, when he purchased a 4½ litre Talbot, and put it second at the Albi Grand Prix, behind Luigi Villoresi in the Maserati.

His 1949 season saw second places at the Marseilles Grand Prix (to Fangio), the European Grand Prix at Monza (to Alberto Ascari), and Czechoslovakian Grand Prix at Brno (to Peter Whitehead in a Ferrari). In addition, he won the Paris Grand Prix at Montlhéry.

Étancelin participated in twelve World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 13 May 1950. He scored a total of three championship points. His fifth place in the 1950 Italian Grand Prix made him the oldest driver ever to score championship points, a record set in the first World Championship season which still stands more than 70 years later.

In 1953, Étancelin ran third at the Rouen &quot;Grand Prix&quot; and at the 12 Hours of Casablanca, and decided to retire. The government of France awarded him the Legion of Honour in recognition of his contribution to the sport of automobile racing that spanned four decades.

Étancelin retained an interest in racing, making occasional appearances in historic racing through 1974.

He died at Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1981.

<text>Prince Birabongse Bhanudej Bhanubandh (; ; 15 July 191423 December 1985), commonly known as Prince Bira of [[Siam]] or simply Prince Bira, was a member of the Thai royal family. Bira was also a racing driver, sailor and pilot, who competed in Formula One from to and at four editions of the Summer Olympics between 1956 and 1972.

A member of the Chakri dynasty, Bira studied at Eton College before he began competing in Grand Prix motor racing in 1935, later advancing to Formula One for its inaugural season. He competed for several teams including Platé, Gordini, Connaught, Milano and Maserati, amongst other privateer entries in Maserati machinery. Across five seasons and 19 Grands Prix, Bira scored several points finishes, including fourth-placed finishes at the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix and the 1954 French Grand Prix, amongst two non-championship race victories. He remained the only Southeast Asian to compete in Formula One until Malaysian driver Alex Yoong in , and the only Thai driver until Alexander Albon in . Outside of Formula One, Bira won the New Zealand Grand Prix in 1955, driving the Maserati 250F. Bira also competed in sailing events at four Summer Olympic Games and was an amateur pilot, flying from London to Bangkok in his own twin-engine Miles Gemini aircraft in 1952.

Bira is credited with establishing the racing colours of Thailand: pale blue and yellow. Upon his death in December 1985, the Bira Circuit was built in his honour, becoming the first motor racing circuit in Thailand to meet FIA standards.

==Early life==
Bira&#x27;s parents were Prince Bhanurangsi Savangwongse and his second wife. Bira&#x27;s paternal grandfather was King Mongkut, loosely portrayed in the Hollywood movies &quot;The King and I&quot; and &quot;Anna and the King&quot;. His mother died when Bira was only four years old. Bira was sent to Europe in 1927 to complete his education in England at Eton College, where he joined one of his nephews, a grandchild of his father through his first marriage. While he was at Eton Bira&#x27;s father died, leaving him an orphan. He was placed under the care of his cousin, Prince Chula Chakrabongse, who ultimately became Bira&#x27;s legal guardian. On leaving Eton at age 18, in early 1933, Bira moved in with Prince Chula in London, while he decided on his future.

Bira had been registered to attend Trinity College, Cambridge, but had not passed the Cambridge University entrance examination. Initially, Prince Chula hired a tutor for Bira, to better prepare him for the exam, but Bira changed his mind and expressed a desire to learn sculpture rather than attend university. Prince Chula approached leading sculptor Charles Wheeler, and Wheeler took Bira on as a pupil within his studio. Although Bira showed some talent as a sculptor, in Wheeler&#x27;s opinion he needed to learn to draw, and so in the autumn of 1934 Bira enrolled at the Byam Shaw School of Art. Bira did not attend the Byam Shaw School for very long, but while there he became friendly with a fellow student, Ceril Heycock, and he began courting her in earnest only a few weeks later. However, both Prince Chula and her parents placed severe limitations on their relationship, and it was not until 1938 that they were able to marry.

==Auto racing==

Bira first raced with his cousin Prince Chula&#x27;s team, &quot;White Mouse Racing&quot;, driving a Riley Imp at Brooklands in 1935. In this car Bira established the national motor racing colours of Siam: pale blue with yellow. He raced under the name &#x27;B Bira&#x27;. He later lived near Geneva, Switzerland, and in the south of France.

Later in 1935, Prince Chula gave him one of the new ERA voiturette racing cars—R2B, which was nicknamed &quot;Romulus&quot;. Bira finished second in his first ever race in Romulus, despite needing to stop for repairs. The remaining races of the season saw Bira consistently placing among the more powerful Grand Prix vehicles, with another second place, and fifth at the Donington Grand Prix.

For 1936 the princes decided that the previous season&#x27;s results merited a second ERA. They purchased chassis R5B (which Bira named &quot;Remus&quot;) to use in British events and retained &quot;Romulus&quot; for international races. Chula also purchased a Maserati 8CM to complete the White Mouse roster. Bira&#x27;s expertise behind the wheel earned him the Coupe de Prince Rainier at Monte Carlo. Bira won a further four races in the ERAs that season, and took the Grand Prix Maserati to 5th at Donington and 3rd at Brooklands. This was the high point for Bira and the White Mouse team.

Following Dick Seaman&#x27;s move to Mercedes for 1937, the Thais purchased his Grand Prix Delage and all of its spare parts, along with a second Delage. Despite several upgrades, and hiring experienced race engineer and future Jaguar team manager Lofty England, the cars underperformed, and on many occasions Bira raced in the older and by now substantially inferior ERAs. In addition, the money spent on the Delage upgrades had sapped the resources of the team and corners were being cut in the ERA&#x27;s race preparations. Later in the year White Mouse did invest in a newer C-Type ERA, chassis R12C. R12C came to be known as &quot;Hanuman&quot;, and Bira attached a large, embossed, silver badge depicting the Hindu deity after whom he had named the car. Following a major accident in 1939 &quot;Hanuman&quot; was rebuilt back to B-Type specifications, and in light of this major overhaul Bira renamed the car &quot;Hanuman II&quot;.

While Bira maintained a respectable results tally in British events, the more costly international races were largely a disaster.

After the war, Bira returned to racing with several teams. He took part in the inaugural World Drivers&#x27; Championship in 1950 racing a supercharged Maserati 4CLT/48, starting four Championship races including the first, at Silverstone, where he was obliged to retire from the race with a fuel feed problem, but finished fifth at Monaco and fourth at Bremgarten the same season, giving him five points and finishing eighth in the Championship. 1950 was his best season; Bira took part in each Championship season until 1954, starting a total of 19 races, but only scored points in one more race - a fourth place at Reims in 1954 provided three points and seventeenth place in the Championship. In 1951 he raced in an old Maserati 4CLT fitted with a newer V12 Osca engine. No results were obtained this year as a result of the poor performance of the car combined with a severe accident. By 1954, with a newer car, a Maserati 250F, he won the Grand Prix des Frontières on the Chimay road circuit and then finished fourth in the 1954 French Grand Prix with his own Maserati. In January 1955, he won the New Zealand Grand Prix at Ardmore; he retired at the end of that season.

Bira returned to racing for the one-off Macau Grand Prix &quot;Race of Giants&quot; in 1978, finishing 13th.

==Sailing==

Bira competed in sailing events at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics in the &quot;Star&quot;, 1960 Rome Olympics in the &quot;Star&quot;, 1964 Tokyo Olympics in the &quot;Dragon&quot; and the 1972 Munich Olympics in the &quot;Tempest&quot;. In the 1960 Games he competed against another former Formula One driver, Roberto Mieres, who finished seventeenth, ahead of the prince at nineteenth.

==Death==

Bira died at Barons Court tube station in London on 23 December 1985. He collapsed and died having suffered a major heart attack, but as he carried no identification with him, his body could not initially be identified. A handwritten note was found in his pocket by the Metropolitan Police and was sent for analysis at the University of London, where it was shown as being written in Thai and addressed to Bira. The Thai Embassy was notified, and realised his significance. A Thai funeral service was held at the Wat Buddhapadipa in Wimbledon, and he was later cremated according to Thai and Buddhist tradition and customs.

==Other honors==
Bira Circuit, based just outside Pattaya, Thailand, is named after Bira.

In 2016, in an academic paper that reported a mathematical modeling study that assessed the relative influence of driver and machine, Bira was ranked the forty-third best Formula One driver of all time.

==Development of the Thai racing colours==
Bira was instrumental in developing and setting the national racing colours of Thailand. The base colour for the scheme, a mid to pale powder blue, was adopted by Bira in 1934, and was derived from the evening dress of a young woman that Bira met during his early years in London. Initially the cars were painted solely in blue, but gradually Bira added in some yellow to offset the base colour. He started painting the cars&#x27; chassis rails yellow in 1939.

<doc id="1235936" wikidata="Q1725073" url="?curid=1235936" title="Saint Arnaud, New Zealand">
<text>Saint Arnaud (previously Rotoiti) is a small alpine village in the Tasman district of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, west of the mountains of the Saint Arnaud Range and 90 kilometres southwest of Nelson near the historic Tophouse Settlement. It is situated at the northern end of Lake Rotoiti.

== Naming ==

The village was called Rotoiti until 1921, when it was renamed by the Department of Lands and Survey to avoid confusion with other communities of the same name. Archives show that between 1921 and 1951 both names were unofficially used by local residents and government agencies when referring to the village area.

Such references include a letter dated 1 June 1950 from the Chief Surveyor of the Nelson District Office of the Department of Lands and Survey to the New Zealand Geographic Board stating that &quot;for many years confusion has occurred due to correspondence addressed to the residents and visitors at Lake Rotoiti in the Nelson Land District going to Lake Rotoiti, near Rotorua, in the Auckland Land District. Due to the same confusion of names, the Town of Rotoiti in the Nelson Land District was altered to Town of St. Arnaud by this Department.&quot; However, the name St. Arnaud did not receive legal approval until it was gazetted on 19 July 1951. Some locals were opposed to this change, as shown by a 4 December 1950 petition held by the New Zealand Geographic Board opposing the name change. Some local residents today still give their address as Lake Rotoiti, even with St. Arnaud as the official name.

A proposal with the New Zealand Geographic Board to either change the village&#x27;s name back to its original name of Rotoiti or to use a dual name (a relatively common practice in New Zealand), failed in 2007. A survey had originally indicated that just over half of the area residents supported a return to the original name.

The town&#x27;s name is something of a shibboleth: while the official pronunciation is the same as would be expected from a French-language name (), locals often voice the name&#x27;s end as .

== Demographics ==
Saint Arnaud is described by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement. It covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. It is part of the larger Murchison-Nelson Lakes statistical area.

Saint Arnaud had a population of 111 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 6 people (5.7%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 33 people (42.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 54 households, comprising 60 males and 54 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.11 males per female. The median age was 54.5 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 9 people (8.1%) aged under 15 years, 15 (13.5%) aged 15 to 29, 60 (54.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 27 (24.3%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 89.2% European/Pākehā, 5.4% Māori, 0.0% Pasifika, 2.7% Asian, and 8.1% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 67.6% had no religion, 18.9% were Christian and 2.7% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 30 (29.4%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 15 (14.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $35,000, compared with $31,800 nationally. 15 people (14.7%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 51 (50.0%) people were employed full-time, 24 (23.5%) were part-time, and 0 (0.0%) were unemployed.

== Government ==
Saint Arnaud falls under the Tasman District Council authority. The current mayor of Tasman is Tim King. Nationally, Saint Arnaud falls under the West Coast-Tasman electorate, which is currently held by Damien O&#x27;Connor of the Labour Party.

== Amenities ==
Mostly catering for a small number of locals and tramping and skiing tourists, the centre of Saint Arnaud has a village store with postal services, a petrol station, a cafe-restaurant, camping facilities, motels, chalets and specialist accommodation for trampers at the Travers-Sabine Lodge youth hostel. A water taxi service operates from a jetty at the northern end of Lake Rotoiti, near to a DOC campsite at Kerr Bay. There is another campsite at West Bay. A daily shuttle bus service along State Highway 63 provides connections to Nelson, Murchison, Greymouth, Blenheim, Westport and Picton.

The Royal New Zealand Air Force&#x27;s field training base is nearby at Dip Flat.

== Attractions ==
=== Nelson Lakes National Park ===
The western part of the township includes a local Department of Conservation (DOC) Visitor Centre, with interactive displays and comprehensive information about the wildlife and environmental management of the Nelson Lakes National Park. The centre has a team of professional staff who can offer detailed advice and guidance about all aspects of the area. A number of local footpaths, tracks and nature trails, suitable for all abilities, are maintained by the department.

Saint Arnaud is a starting point for the strenuous 80 km Travers - Sabine tramping circuit. This follows the valley of the Travers River, ascends over the sub-alpine Travers Saddle, the watershed, and then descends the Sabine River valley and gorge to Lake Rotoroa. From here walkers can complete the circuit back to Saint Arnaud by either crossing a low saddle to the valley of Lake Rotoiti, via the Speargrass Track, or by ascending a higher route via Mount Angelus. Alternatively, they can take a water taxi from the DOC Sabine Hut on Lake Rotoroa up to the northern end of the lake.

In winter, snow sports take place primarily at Rainbow Skifield on the eastern side of the Saint Arnaud Range. Other local recreational activities include fishing, hunting, kayaking, small boat sailing, and gliding.

== Infrastructure ==
State Highway 63 passes through Saint Arnaud, linking the town to Blenheim and Marlborough in the east and Murchison and the West Coast in the west. Korere Tophouse Road leaves SH 63 four kilometres east of Saint Arnaud, and provides the most direct route to Richmond and Nelson.

Network Tasman owns and operates the electricity distribution network in Saint Arnaud. Electricity is fed from Transpower&#x27;s national grid at its Kikiwa substation, north of the town.

The Tasman District Council operates reticulated stormwater and wastewater systems in Saint Arnaud, but not a reticulated fresh water supply. Individual properties are required to build and maintain their own fresh water supply.

==Education==
Lake Rotoiti School is the sole school in Saint Arnaud, serving students from years 1 to 8 (ages 5 to 12) with a roll of as of The nearest schools offering secondary education are Tapawera Area School and Murchison Area School, and away by road respectively.

== Climate ==
According to the Koppen Climate Classification it is a temperate climate (cfb). Despite its altitude of approximately 650m (2,130ft) it rarely has snowfall due to oceanic influences, being near the Cook Strait, compared to other towns in similar altitudes like Lake Tekapo, Arthurs Pass, Mount Cook Village and even Waiouru in the North Island.

<text>Ralph David Firman Jr. (born 20 May 1975) is a British-born former racing driver who raced under Irish citizenship (his mother Angela is from Ireland) and an Irish-issued racing licence. Earlier in his career he raced under a British licence. His father, Ralph Firman Sr., co-founded the Van Diemen racecar constructor with Ross Ambrose, father of V8 Supercars champion Marcos, then more recently founded RFR. He is married to Aldís Kristín Árnadóttir, an Icelandic UK-educated lawyer. Ralph&#x27;s sister, Natasha, is also a racing driver.

==Career==

===Formula Three===

Educated at Gresham&#x27;s School between 1988 and 1993, Firman went straight into motor racing on leaving school. Despite leading much of the 1995 British F3 championship, he lost the title at the final round to Oliver Gavin. However, he continued in the championship in 1996 and captured the title at his second attempt.

====Macau Grand Prix controversy====
Firman won the prestigious Macau Grand Prix in 1996 under controversial circumstances. At the end of round 1, Firman finished ahead of German Formula 3 champion Jarno Trulli. In round 2, he was overtaken by Trulli on the last lap. Firman was running with a broken front wing. Just as Jarno Trulli was on the way to victory, Firman crashed at the hairpin corner, blocked the track and caused a red flag. The race officials counted the results to the previous lap when Firman was ahead of Trulli, thus giving him the win.

===Formula Nippon===
Firman then moved to Japan, culminating in the 2002 Formula Nippon championship, before returning to Europe.

===Formula One===

Firman secured a seat in Formula One for the season at the Jordan team, alongside Giancarlo Fisichella. He participated in 14 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting at the 2003 Australian Grand Prix. He scored one championship point, in the 2003 Spanish Grand Prix. This point was the first for a Republic of Ireland driver since Derek Daly in 1982. He was injured in a huge crash during practice for the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix which forced him to sit out that and the next race, in which he was replaced by Zsolt Baumgartner.

In November 2003, Firman drove a Jordan-Ford EJ13 at Macau&#x27;s Guia Circuit as part of the Macau Grand Prix&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations, the first time that a contemporary F1 machine had been seen in action around the tight and tricky Guia circuit. Firman clocked an impressive 1:59.4 seconds lap, 13 seconds quicker than F3 poleman Fabio Carbone managed on the same day.

===Post-Formula One===
Firman has also competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and was an official test driver for the A1 Grand Prix series in August 2004.

In August 2005, it was announced that he would be the driver for A1 Team Ireland. He had previously been seen to be in competition for the Great Britain seat.

In 2007, Firman, along with Daisuke Ito, won the Japan Super GT GT500 class championship with the Aguri Suzuki co-owned ARTA team. Firman and Ito won the championship before the final race of the season, a first in the series&#x27; competitive history.

===Retirement from racing===
Firman retired from racing in 2013, and now runs a British engineering company.

<doc id="1235940" wikidata="Q171766" url="?curid=1235940" title="Ricardo Rodríguez (racing driver)">
<text>Ricardo Valentín Rodríguez de la Vega (14 February 1942 – 1 November 1962) was the first Mexican driver ever to take part in a Formula One Grand Prix, competing in the 1961 and 1962 Formula One seasons.
At the age of 19 years and 208 days, when first racing for Ferrari at the 1961 Italian Grand Prix, he became the youngest Formula One driver to race for the legendary Italian team, a title he held until the 2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, where his record was broken by Briton Oliver Bearman at 18 years and 305 days old. At this Italian Grand Prix, he also became the youngest driver to start a Formula One race until the 1980 Canadian Grand Prix, and the youngest driver to start from the first row until the 2016 Belgian Grand Prix, and at the 1962 Belgian Grand Prix he also became the youngest driver to score points in Formula One, a record he held until the 2000 Brazilian Grand Prix. His death at the age of 20 in a crash during practice for the 1962 Mexican Grand Prix made him the youngest Formula One driver to die.

His elder brother, Pedro, was also a noted racing driver who had much success in both sports car racing and Formula One, including a season with Ferrari in 1969, who was killed in a crash during a sportscar race at the Norisring in 1971.

== Personal life ==

Rodríguez was born in Mexico City and was a child cycling champion who switched to motorcycles in domestic competition from the age of 11. He was the third son from the marriage of Pedro Natalio Rodríguez and Concepción &quot;Conchita&quot; (&quot;née&quot; de la Vega), he had three brothers and one sister, Pedro, Federico, Conchita and Alejandro.

He was married to Sara (&quot;née&quot; Cardoso) in July 1961 but left no children. In the summer of 1962 his close friend, Jo Ramírez, would accompany Ricardo to his adventure in Europe.

== Career ==

He won several national motorcycle titles, before taking up saloon car racing in his own Fiat Topolino. In 1957 he made his international debut at Riverside, beating all comers in the under 1.5 litre class in a Porsche RS. He then won his class in a Porsche Spyder in the Nassau Tourist Trophy. He often raced for the North American Racing Team (NART) with his brother Pedro, although he would also enter cars under his own team&#x27;s name, Scuderia Rodríguez.

He was refused an entry at Le Mans in 1958 because he was too young (16 years and 106 days), but went back in 1959 to race an OSCA in the 750cc class. In the edition of 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1960 he partnered André Pilette to second place. At 18 years and 133 days of age, he is the youngest driver ever to stand on the podium at Le Mans.

Rodríguez was given a guest drive by Ferrari for the 1961 Italian Grand Prix, qualifying a surprise second and becoming the youngest driver in history to start from front row (19 years and 208 days), a record that would not be beaten until the 2016 Belgian Grand Prix by Max Verstappen. In the race he exchanged the lead with Phil Hill and Richie Ginther many times, until a fuel pump failure ended his race. 1962 saw a full works drive with Ferrari, who used him sparingly considering his age and rough edges. Whenever used, Rodríguez shone, taking second at the Pau Grand Prix, fourth at the Belgian Grand Prix and sixth at the German Grand Prix in a tough year in Formula One for Ferrari. He also won the 1962 Targa Florio edition with Olivier Gendebien and Willy Mairesse in a Ferrari 246 SP.

Rodríguez was considered a potential future champion already, but was left without a drive when Ferrari opted not to enter the non-Championship 1962 Mexican Grand Prix at the Magdalena Mixiuhca Circuit, Mexico City. He signed to drive Rob Walker&#x27;s Lotus 24, but died during the first day of unofficial practice, when the Lotus&#x27; rear right suspension failed at the fearsome Peraltada turn, and it hit the barriers, killing him almost instantaneously. He was 20 years old and his death provoked national mourning in Mexico.

The Scuderia Rodríguez A.C. (a friends and family foundation) keeps his memory and that of his brother alive. It serves as register for Rodríguez memorabilia and cars, certifying them, and its Secretary General Carlos Jalife published their biography in 2006, and a second edition came in 2015. He did an English translation that was published in 2009 and won the Motor Press Guild Book of the Year.

=== Ricardo Rodríguez in the 24 Hours of Le Mans ===
*On 1958 24 Hours of Le Mans judged to be too young, 16-year-old Ricardo Rodríguez was not allowed to start by the organisers, Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest, so was replaced by José Behra, brother of Jean, to accompany his older brother, Pedro Rodríguez.

<doc id="1235941" wikidata="Q171777" url="?curid=1235941" title="Roberto Mieres">
<text>Roberto Casimiro Mieres (3 December 1924 – 26 January 2012) was a racing driver from Mar del Plata, Argentina. He participated in 17 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 7 June 1953. He scored a total of 13 championship points.

==Formula One and sports car racer==
Mieres competed in a number of different sports, including rowing, sailing, rugby, and tennis. He first took up motorsport in Argentina with an MG, which he later replaced with a Mercedes-Benz SSK and then a Bugatti formerly driven by Achille Varzi, using the latter to win the Argentine sports car championship. As a reward, he was invited to join his compatriots Juan Manuel Fangio and José Froilán González on a trip to Europe, during which he finished fourth in the 1950 Circuit des Nations in Geneva driving a Maserati 4CLT/48 Formula Two car. After returning to Argentina, he was recruited by the Gordini team to replace the injured Jean Behra, allowing him to make his début in the World Championship at the 1953 Dutch Grand Prix. He also competed in the French and Italian Grands Prix, taking a best finish of sixth at Monza.

Mieres scored his best result of 1953, however, in the non-championship Grand Prix de l&#x27;Albigeois held in Albi, France, finishing in fourth place. He also finished third in a sports car handicap race at Caen in July 1953, which was won by Jean Chancel. In January 1954 Mieres came in second at the Buenos Aires Grand Prix. Maurice Trintignant was victorious after Mike Hawthorn skidded close to the finish. The tail of Mieres&#x27; Maserati caught fire during the 1954 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa Francorchamps. After belatedly realising this, he slammed on the brakes and jumped to safety. Mieres then finished fifth in a Maserati at the 1954 British Grand Prix at Silverstone. In the 1957 City of Buenos Aires sports car race Mieres drove a 3.5 litre Jaguar to a fourth-place finish. His driving partner was Ninian Sanderson of Scotland. Mieres later teamed with Anton Van Dorey for a win in the 1959 USAC Road Racing Championship Daytona 1,000 km, the predecessor to the modern Rolex 24 at Daytona.

It is likely that an oil slick dropped by Mieres&#x27; Porsche caused a tragic accident at the 1958 Cuban Grand Prix, in which at least four people were killed and fifty more injured. Ferrari driver Armando Garcia Cifuentes skidded on a large oil slick which had been deposited on the track and crashed into a grandstand; one lap earlier, Mieres had pitted to replenish oil he had lost with a broken oil line.

==Retirement==
After his racing career wound down in the late 1950s, Mieres returned to his other interest of sailing, and represented Argentina in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. He competed against fellow former racing driver, Prince Bira in the Star class, finishing 17th and beating his old rival in the process. Only five others have competed in both the Formula One World Championships and the Olympics. He died at the age of 87 in Uruguay.

<text>Silvio Moser (24 April 1941 – 26 May 1974) was a racing driver from Switzerland.

==Early life and career==
Moser began his career in the early sixties, racing Alfa Romeos and moved to single seaters in 1964, with a good deal of success both in European Formula three and the Temporada Series.

==Formula One==

Having built a strong reputation in Formula Junior/Three, Formula Two and sports car racing Moser debuted in Formula One on 15 July 1967 at the British Grand Prix with a Vögele Team Cooper-ATS. Prior to this he had attempted to qualify for the German Grand Prix in 1966 with a Formula Two Brabham–Cosworth BT16, entered in his own name, but the engine failed in practice. He continued in 1968 with a Brabham-Repco BT20, in 1969 in a privately entered Brabham BT24 Cosworth, in 1970 with the Bellasi-Cosworth and again for one race in 1971. In total, he participated in 19 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix (12 starts), scoring a total of three championship points.

==Post Formula One and death==

After the failure of the Bellasi project Moser returned to Formula Two and drove a Brabham in 1971 and 1972, and a Surtees in 1973, with limited success, but managed second place at Monza in the Lottery GP.

Moser died from severe injuries without regaining consciousness, 31 days after being involved in an accident while driving his Lola T294-BMW in the 1,000 km sports car race at Monza.

<text>The M876 motorway is a motorway in Scotland. The motorway runs from Denny to Airth in the Falkirk council area, forming an approach road to the Kincardine Bridge. It was opened in 1980.

The road is long. It begins by turning off junction 8 (formerly junction 5 until 2011) of the M80 and bypasses Falkirk and Stenhousemuir. It is one of only three motorways in the UK which form a concurrency with another motorway, the M9, which it then leaves again and continues for before becoming the A876.

The original Kincardine Bridge was supplemented in 2008 by a second bridge, the Clackmannanshire Bridge, for traffic towards Alloa. As part of the works, the terminal Bowtrees Roundabout was replaced with a grade separated junction, and the A876 beyond the junction was upgraded to dual carriageway standard.

<doc id="1235947" wikidata="Q57435" url="?curid=1235947" title="Stefan Bellof">
<text>Stefan Bellof (20 November 1957 – 1 September 1985) was a German racing driver. Bellof was the winner of the Drivers&#x27; Championship in the 1984 FIA World Endurance Championship, driving for the factory Rothmans Porsche team. His lap record on the Nordschleife configuration at the Nürburgring, set while qualifying for the 1000 km race in 1983, stood for 35 years, when it was beaten by Timo Bernhard in 2018. He also competed in Formula One with Tyrrell Racing during and . Bellof was killed in an accident during the 1985 1000 km of Spa, a round of the 1985 World Sportscar Championship.

==Career==

===Karting===
Born in Gießen, West Germany, and following in his brother Georg&#x27;s footsteps, Stefan Bellof made his karting début in 1973, competing in the Automobilclub von Deutschland&#x27;s Federal Junior Cup, in which he ended up in fourth position. Several other top-five championship placings occurred during the next few years before Bellof claimed his first karting title, by winning the International Karting Championship of Luxembourg in 1976. In the same season, Bellof also finished thirteenth in the Karting World Championship in Hagen, Germany. Georg won the German Karting Championship in 1978, while Stefan finished in eighth position in the same race, improving to third in 1979 and becoming German champion in 1980, while dovetailing a campaign in Formula Ford.

===Junior formulae===
Bellof moved into Formula Ford at the tail end of the 1979 season, as a member of Walter Lechner&#x27;s Racing School setup, making his bow at Hockenheim in November 1979, where he finished in second place. A full season in the 1600cc class beckoned in 1980, and Bellof became champion taking eight victories and nine podium placings from twelve races. He continued in the series in 1981, but was not as successful as his championship-winning season, taking five wins and also made a foray into the more powerful 2000cc class, but retired from both his starts in the Lion Trophy at Zolder and the 300 km meeting at the Nürburgring. Bellof also contested three VW Castrol Europa Pokal races, of which he won one.

As well as those outings, Bellof moved into the German Formula Three Championship, making his début for Bertram Schäfer&#x27;s team at Wunstorf. Despite missing the opening two races of the season, Bellof led the championship by seven points going into the final round at the Nürburgring, having taken a top four finish in each of his first eight races. Luck eluded Bellof however, as he finished the race in thirteenth position, while title rivals Frank Jelinski and Franz Konrad finished in first and second places to overhaul Bellof&#x27;s points total. Eleven points separated Bellof from Jelinski, who claimed his second successive German Formula Three championship. At the conclusion of the season, Bellof contested the Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch, but was excluded from the meeting after finishing sixth in his quarter-final heat, for excessive contact. Bellof made a promise to the meeting&#x27;s clerk of the course, saying that the official had &quot;better watch my career, because I&#x27;ll be back here next year and I&#x27;ll win my first Formula 2 race.&quot;

===Formula Two===
Bellof joined Mike Thackwell and Alain Ferté at a test session with Maurer Motorsport at Circuit Paul Ricard in France at the end of the 1981 season. Eje Elgh, who finished third with Maurer in the 1981 European Formula Two Championship was present at the test and was impressed by Bellof, and recommended him to team boss Willy Maurer to sign him for the 1982 season. After acquiring a limited amount of BMW backing, Bellof assumed a place in the team, with Maurer eventually becoming his manager, having signed an eight-year management deal with Bellof.

The first race of the season was the BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone, where Bellof qualified ninth on the grid. Sticking to his promise that he made at the 1981 Formula Ford Festival, Bellof drove through the field in showery conditions to win by 21 seconds ahead of Satoru Nakajima and became the first driver to win outright, and second driver to win a race on his European Formula Two début after Dave Morgan won on aggregate at Silverstone in . He followed this win up with a second successive triumph at the Jim Clark Gedächtnisrennen at Hockenheim, having started from pole position and achieved the fastest lap during the race. Two points from the next six races ruled him out of the championship hunt, as he fell to an eventual fourth place classification, scoring 33 points.

By comparison to his 1982 season, Bellof&#x27;s 1983 season was much less successful. He made only one trip to the podium with second at Jarama while he lost another podium when he was disqualified from third place at the Pau Grand Prix, after his and teammate Ferté&#x27;s cars were found to be underweight at the race&#x27;s conclusion. Bellof&#x27;s only other points-scoring finish was fourth at Silverstone, as he finished the season in ninth position on nine points.

===Sportscar racing===
While competing in Formula Two in 1982, Bellof made a one-off appearance in the World Endurance Championship at the 1000 km of Spa, partnering Rolf Stommelen at the wheel of a Kremer CK5. The pairing retired from the race on lap 51, due to a problem with the starter motor. The previous weekend, Bellof had joined Kremer to compete in the Hessen Cup at Hockenheim as part of the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft, but retired with transmission failure.
In 1983, Bellof joined the Rothmans-backed Porsche factory team for the World Endurance Championship driving a Porsche 956 alongside Derek Bell. Bellof and Bell won first time at the 1000 km Silverstone, beating Bob Wollek and Stefan Johansson by almost a minute, having taken the lead at half-distance, completing the race&#x27;s duration at an average speed of . Bellof&#x27;s pole time for the race – 1 minute, 13.15 seconds – would have put him twelfth on the grid for the later in the year. The next race on the calendar was the 1000 km Nürburgring in which Bellof rewrote several records at the Nordschleife. His pole time for that race of 6 minutes, 11.13 seconds is unofficially the fastest lap ever driven on the Nürburgring Nordschleife in its current configuration, taking pole position by five seconds, at an average speed of . Bellof also set the fastest lap during the race, with a lap time of 6 minutes, 25.91 seconds, which remains the official Nordschleife lap record for all cars. Two laps after setting the race record, on lap 20, Bellof&#x27;s 956 – chassis 956-007 – flipped out of the race at the Pflanzgarten. Bellof added two more wins later in the season at Kyalami and at Fuji, as he ended the season in fourth position. He also added a win in the non-championship Norisring Trophäe race.

Bellof was the dominant force in the 1984 championship driving alongside Bell, with John Watson also joining the team. Bellof also contested races with Brun Motorsport with whom he won at Imola partnering Hans-Joachim Stuck. Bell and Bellof won the opening round of the season at Monza, but only after the pairing were reinstated to the results. After crossing the line first, their 956 was promptly disqualified in scrutineering with the car found to be under the weight limit, which would also apply to the third-placed Martini Racing Lancia LC2. Appeals from both teams were lodged, with the outcome being successful.

Other victories at the Nürburgring, Spa, Mosport and Sandown helped Bellof claim the World Sportscar title by eight points from Jochen Mass, and also helped Porsche secure the manufacturer&#x27;s title for the year; the make taking all but one victory in the season. He was also champion in the German DRM series. Bellof only contested six sportscar races in 1985, taking one win at the Norisring alongside Thierry Boutsen again in DRM.

===Formula One===

Bellof first tested a Formula One car towards the end of 1983, when he joined the top two drivers from that season&#x27;s British Formula 3 Championship – Ayrton Senna and Martin Brundle – in testing for McLaren at Silverstone, where Bellof damaged the gearbox before Brundle&#x27;s opportunity behind the wheel. Bellof did move into the championship ahead of the season, joining Tyrrell Racing Organisation, to partner Brundle in naturally aspirated, Ford-engined machinery, which were giving away in excess of to their turbo rivals.

Bellof failed to finish in his first two races in Brazil and South Africa, before scoring his first two championship points in successive races at Zolder and Imola. A retirement followed at Dijon, before Bellof achieved a podium finish in the rain-shortened . Despite starting down in 20th and last place, Bellof remained away from the barriers that caught out many of his rivals, and was catching the race-leading pairing of Alain Prost and Senna when the race was curtailed after 31 laps due to inclement weather conditions. At the end of the race, Bellof had been 21 seconds in arrears of Prost and 13.7 behind Senna. Retirements followed in Canada and in Detroit, where Brundle claimed the team&#x27;s best result of the season with second position as Bellof stuck his Tyrrell in the pit wall.

However, Bellof, Brundle and the team were stripped of all their championship points, after their cars were disqualified from the 1984 season after a dispute over lead ballast in their fuel tanks found after the . FISA charged the team on four separate counts, but the team appealed for injunctions to allow them to continue competing in the championship. Ultimately, the FIA Court of Appeal rejected their final appeal and kicked the team out of the remainder of the season. Despite this, Bellof missed his home race to compete in a World Sportscar race on the same weekend at Mosport Park, where he and Derek Bell finished fourth overall and third in class.
Bellof remained with the team into the season, but did miss the opening round of the season – the  – as Tyrrell had Brundle and Stefan Johansson in their two cars in Rio de Janeiro. Bellof returned at the at Estoril where the weather conditions were similar to that of Monaco 1984 in which Bellof had slithered his way up to the on-the-road positioning of third place. He once again started way down the order in 21st place, but by the race&#x27;s conclusion, he had managed to make it into the top six, and claiming a point for the team, which would be Bellof&#x27;s first as all of his 1984 results were expunged.

He failed to qualify in Monaco, the only time Bellof failed to qualify in his short Formula One career, along with his exclusion at the 1984 Austrian Grand Prix. He made amends for his error of 1984 in Detroit, by finishing fourth in the 1985 race, which would ultimately be his final three points in Formula One. His final race was the , where his Renault turbocharged engine blew on lap 40. Tyrrell had only changed to such engines from the onwards meaning that Bellof never truly had the opportunity to show his talent at the wheel of a Formula One car.

==Death==
Bellof was racing at the 1000 km of Spa World Sportscar Championship race at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium on 1 September 1985, the seventh race of that season&#x27;s championship. Bellof was making his fourth appearance of 1985 in the series. Partnering Thierry Boutsen as he had done in his other appearances during the season, their Brun-Porsche 956B-116 would start the race from third on the grid, 0.86 seconds adrift of the pole position-winning Lancia LC2.

On lap 78, Bellof was racing Jacky Ickx&#x27;s works Porsche 962C from the La Source hairpin on the run to Eau Rouge corner. Both drivers had just commenced their stints in their respective cars after Boutsen and Jochen Mass started them. Entering the left kink of Eau Rouge, Bellof moved to the left of Ickx in an attempt to set up a pass for the immediate right-hand Raidillon corner up the hill. This created a side draft on Ickx&#x27;s 962C, which pulled to the left in an instant, enough to bring Bellof&#x27;s right front into contact with Ickx&#x27;s left rear, sending both cars hurtling away from each other. Ickx&#x27;s car spun, and as he desperately tried to recover it, it spun so that the right rear of the car impacted the barriers, likely saving his life as the force of the impact pushed him back into his seat. Bellof, on the other hand, crashed directly into the barriers at unabated speed with his left front corner, breaking through and hitting a secondary wall. The Brun Porsche caught fire moments after the wreck, while Ickx – able to climb unaided from his car – attempted to help safety workers in extricating Bellof. During the caution period, members of the Brun team also arrived to aid in the rescue. With smoke pouring from the wreckage, the emergency medical team struggled for over 10 minutes before extricating him. Bellof was pronounced dead of massive internal injuries after he had reached the track hospital.

Out of respect for Bellof, the race organisers chose to end the event some 150 km earlier than planned. The entire incident was recorded on an in-car camera that Ickx&#x27;s 962C was carrying. Even after the accident, the camera continued to work, and was pointed in the direction of Bellof&#x27;s wreckage. The accident involving Bellof was the second in the space of three weeks in which a driver was killed at the wheel of a Porsche. At the previous World Sportscar race at Mosport Park in Canada, fellow West German and F1 driver Manfred Winkelhock died of severe head trauma after crashing into a concrete wall while at the wheel of a Kremer Racing-run Porsche 962C. Many of the customer teams had concerns with using the 956 for the remainder of the season, and the 956 was eventually withdrawn from the series by the end of the 1986 season, taking victory on its final start at the 1000 km of Fuji.

==Effect and legacy==
After Bellof&#x27;s death at Spa, Formula One teams became unwilling to allow their expensive drivers to compete in other races that were not part of the championship. Fellow Formula One driver Jonathan Palmer was injured in an unrelated accident during a free practice session at the same meeting, with the result being that many teams would have drivers&#x27; contracts tightened to prohibit them from competing outside their respective championships. Bellof&#x27;s talent had been noted by many of the rival teams that he had been competing against in Formula One, including an offer from Ferrari for the season, with a meeting scheduled with Enzo Ferrari before his death.

Bellof is often mentioned as Michael Schumacher&#x27;s childhood racing idol. During an interview for the January 2007 issue of the &quot;911 and Porsche World&quot; magazine, teammate Derek Bell felt Bellof&#x27;s death was caused by lack of discipline in his driving style, and that the blame for his death lay with those around Bellof, including team personnel, who should have allowed him to mature. In 2010 Bellof&#x27;s family donated his racing mementos to the local Sammler und Hobbywelt museum for public display. The donated items included his go-kart from his early racing days, his racing overalls and helmets from his works Porsche and Tyrrell days and trophies. There is a karting circuit named in his honour known as , located in Oppenrod.

In 2009, a poll of 217 Formula One drivers chose Bellof as their 35th greatest Formula One driver, in a survey conducted by British magazine &quot;Autosport&quot;. In August 2013, Bellof was honoured after management of the Nürburgring renamed the section of the Nordschleife previously known as Pflanzgarten III as the Stefan-Bellof-S. In the 2015 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, German driver Timo Bernhard wore a helmet with Bellof&#x27;s helmet livery to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Bellof&#x27;s death.

<text>Anthony William Brise (28 March 1952 – 29 November 1975) was an English racing driver, who took part in ten Formula One Grand Prix events in 1975, before dying in a plane crash with Graham Hill.

==Early life==
Brise was born in Erith, Kent, the son of John Brise, a pig farmer and racing driver, who won the World Stock Car Championship on three occasions. Both Tony and his brother Tim showed an interest in go-karting at a young age, and John Brise gave up his hobby to support them fully.

==Early motor racing career==
Brise won his first UK championship in 1969, and switched to single-seater racing the next year, driving an Elden MK8 Formula Ford. In 1971 he placed second in the BOC British FF1600 Championship. While completing a BSc in Business Administration at Aston University, he chose to continue with motor racing, joining Formula 3 in 1972 driving a Brabham BT28, the team run by Bernie Ecclestone. After switching to GRD 372, his performance increased until he was one of the top drivers in the formula. He won two of the three British Formula 3 Championships in 1973, sharing one (the Lombard North Central championship) with Richard Robarts, as well as winning the John Player. At the end of the season he won a Grovewood Award for the second time, shared with Tom Pryce.

Brise wished to move up to Formula 2 for the 1974 seasons, but was unable to due to financial limitations. Instead he bought a second-hand March 733 car, fitting it with a Holbay-tuned Ford and entering the MCD Formula Atlantic series. He won the first round of the British Championship unexpectedly, but subsequently wrote the car off in a crash at Snetterton. However, his performance had brought him to the attention of Teddy Savory of Modus, who offered him a work drive in the series. Although the car was another modified F3 chassis, he drove well enough to earn a drive in a purpose-built car in 1975. He also drove a Modus M1 F3 in the Monaco Grand Prix F3 support race, finishing second behind Tom Pryce in a March 743. Brise excelled in the new car in 1975, winning six consecutive races, at Snetterton, Oulton Park, and twice each at Brands Hatch and Silverstone, enough to win him the MCD International Formula Atlantic Championship. As a result of these achievements, he was contacted by Frank Williams in April, to make his Formula One debut standing in for Jacques Laffite.

==Formula One career==

Brise made his Grand Prix debut on 27 April 1975 for Williams at the Spanish Grand Prix in Montjuic Park near Barcelona, a controversial race marred by strikes over safety issues, a high number of crashes, and the deaths of four spectators. Brise finished seventh in this race, two laps behind the leaders, his race affected by a collision with Tom Pryce.

Laffite returned for the subsequent Monaco Grand Prix, demoting Brise once again to Formula Atlantic, though former world champion Graham Hill&#x27;s retirement at that race, due to a failure to qualify, brought Brise straight back into the higher formula driving for Embassy Hill, intended to be for the rest of the season. Over the next few races Brise showed a lot of promise, recording some very fast qualifying times and frequently outperforming his team-mate, Alan Jones. However, a combination of technical difficulties and bad luck prevented him from ever finishing in high leader-board positions, and he took just one championship point. Nonetheless, by consensus he was considered a bright hope and one to watch for the future, with a successful season anticipated in 1976.

==Plane crash==

On 29 November 1975, Hill and Brise, along with Andy Smallman, the team&#x27;s designer, and three team mechanics, were returning to London from southern France, where they were testing a new race car, the GH2. The Embassy Hill plane, a twin-engine six-seat Piper Aztec piloted by Hill, was attempting to land at Elstree Airfield at night in thick fog when it crashed and burned at Arkley golf course, killing all six aboard. Brise was 23 years old.

==Personal life==
Brise&#x27;s wife, Janet, was the daughter of triallist Reg Allen. His nephew, David Brise, is currently driving in the Britcar Endurance Championship in a Saker RAPX.

<doc id="1235950" wikidata="Q1291809" url="?curid=1235950" title="Kettle Falls">
<text>Kettle Falls (Salish: Shonitkwu, meaning &quot;roaring or noisy waters&quot;, also Schwenetekoo translated as &quot;Keep Sounding Water&quot;) was an ancient and important salmon fishing site on the upper reaches of the Columbia River, in what is today the U.S. state of Washington, near the Canada–US border. The falls consisted of a series of rapids and cascades where the river passed through quartzite rocks deposited by prehistoric floods on a substrate of Columbia River basalt. The river dropped nearly , and the sound of the falls could be heard for miles away. Kettle Falls was inundated in 1940, as the waters of the reservoir Lake Roosevelt rose behind Grand Coulee Dam, permanently flooding the site.

==History==

At least nine thousand years ago Paleo-Indian cultures gathered at Kettle Falls to fish and gather foods. Salish-speaking people arrived about two thousand years ago, and gradually the falls became the center of an extensive network of Native American trade based on a salmon economy. Native peoples came from coastal areas in the west and from the Great Plains in the east to fish, trade, and socialize with the bands of the Columbia River Plateau. Up to fourteen tribes met regularly at Kettle Falls during the salmon spawning season from June to October. They stood on rocks near the shore or on Indian Island in the middle of the falls, fishing with spears and distinctive J-shaped baskets. In his memoir &quot;White Grizzly Bear&#x27;s Legacy: Learning to be Indian&quot;, Lawney Reyes described the cultural and economic significance of the falls for his people, the Sinixt, and explained the role of subsistence fishing in maintaining salmon populations: &quot;The bands moved to the banks of the river and caught the salmon that were not strong enough to clear the falls. This method of fishing made sure that only the strongest fish went on to spawn.&quot;

The Canadian mapmaker and explorer David Thompson was the first white person to describe the upper portion of the Columbia River. He arrived at Kettle Falls on June 19, 1811, naming it &quot;Ilth koy ape&quot;, a local name for the baskets the native peoples used to catch fish. Thompson spent two weeks at the falls, preparing for his journey downriver and observing the native fishing culture. He described the village area as &quot;a kind of general rendezvous for news, trade, and settling disputes, in which these villagers acted as arbitrators, never joining any war party&quot;. The fur traders of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established a presence at nearby Fort Colvile in 1825. The Jesuit priest Pierre-Jean De Smet visited the area in 1841 and found native people catching up to 3,000 fish a day. The Jesuits established St. Paul&#x27;s Mission at the falls in 1845. The original town of Kettle Falls was established in 1891 by speculators from Spokane. They built a large hotel on the river overlooking the falls and envisioned a glamorous resort town, but the railroad bypassed the settlement, and the resort never grew much larger than 300 residents.

===Flooded by Grand Coulee Dam===

Kettle Falls was flooded in 1940, when the Grand Coulee Dam impounded the Columbia River to create Lake Roosevelt. The waters behind the dam rose , flooding more than of prime bottomland along the river where native peoples lived, as well as the original town of Kettle Falls. In June 1940, an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 people mourned the falls at a &quot;Ceremony of Tears&quot; organized by the Colvilles and attended by representatives of the Yakama, Spokane, Nez Perce, Flathead, Blackfeet, Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Tulalip, and Pend d&#x27;Oreille tribes.

Native burial grounds on Indian Island were moved, and the town of Kettle Falls was relocated to the present site of Kettle Falls, Washington. In addition to submerging the falls, Grand Coulee permanently blocked anadromous fish from traveling upriver, ending salmon and steelhead migration in the upper Columbia River Basin. As with the flooding of Priest Rapids, Celilo Falls, and Cascades Rapids downriver, the loss of Kettle Falls ended the traditional way of life for the native cultures that revolved around salmon fishing. Many native people moved out of the area, but others live today on the nearby Spokane and Colville Indian Reservations. The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation filed a lawsuit against the United States government, which was settled in 1994 for $53 million, plus $15.25 million annually from 1996 onward.

=== The Third Powerhouse ===

During the late 1960s and early 1970s Grand Coulee Dam was expanded to include a new group of generators, commonly known as the Third Powerhouse. During the spring months of this period of construction Lake Roosevelt was drastically lowered (referred to as a drawdown). The largest of these drawdowns occurred during the spring of 1969 and 1974 partially exposing Kettle Falls. In addition to exposing the falls these drawdowns also allowed the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area and the United States Bureau of Reclamation to undergo a major archaeological salvage program of Native American and historical sites previously flooded by Lake Roosevelt.

<doc id="1235951" wikidata="Q173244" url="?curid=1235951" title="Vic Elford">
<text>Victor Henry Elford (10 June 1935 – 13 March 2022) was an English sports car racing, rallying, and Formula One driver. He participated in 13 World Championship F1 Grands Prix, debuting on 7 July 1968. He scored a total of 8 championship points.

Nicknamed &quot;Quick Vic&quot; by his peers Elford was mainly a famous sports car competitor as well as a successful rally driver, associated often with Porsche.

==Career==
Elford started as a co-driver, partnering David Seigle-Morris in a Triumph TR3A. By 1961 he had acquired the confidence to see himself as a potential driver in his own right: the confidence was not shared by team manager Marcus Chambers, and Elford purchased a race-tuned Mini which he rallied as a privateer with limited success before selling it at the end of the season. 1962 found him achieving success in several UK rallies driving a factory sponsored DKW Junior. The next year saw a return to Triumph and Elford achieved impressively fast times with the Triumph TR4s, although reliability of the cars in Elford&#x27;s hands was disappointing, and the following year Elford switched to Ford: this was the beginning of a successful three-year rallying stint with the Ford Cortinas.

In 1967 Elford was European rally champion in a works Porsche 911S. Among other victories he won the 1968 Rally Monte Carlo in a Porsche 911S and only a week later the 24 Hours of Daytona in a Porsche 907, Porsche&#x27;s first ever overall win in a 24-hour race.
Later that year, he also won the Targa Florio teamed with veteran Umberto Maglioli in a famous come-from-behind race after he lost 18 minutes in the first lap due to a tyre failure. Elford then entered the French Grand Prix and finished fourth in his first F1 race – a wet one, too.

By finishing the 1969 Monaco Grand Prix despite troubles, he became the only driver to do well in both famous events in Monte Carlo since Louis Chiron.

Racing in the World Sportscar Championship for Martini Racing against the mighty JWA Gulf team, he was clocked at over 380 km/h in the Porsche 917LH in practice for the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans. He went on to win the 1971 12 Hours of Sebring in a Porsche 917K, as well as several 1000km Nürburgring races.
During the 1972 24 Hours of Le Mans, when he saw a burning Ferrari Daytona in front of him, Elford stopped in mid-race to save the driver. When opening the door, Elford found an empty cockpit, as the driver already had escaped. Elford then noticed the wreck of a Lola among the trees, with Jo Bonnier having been killed. Cameras caught the act and Elford was named Chevalier of the National Order of Merit by French President Georges Pompidou.

A Targa Florio, Sebring and Daytona winner, his favourite track was nonetheless the Nürburgring despite the disappointing results in his three F1 attempts there, of which the first two ended in lap 1 accidents. His two last GPs were at the Nürburgring. In addition to the 1000 km, Elford won some 500 km races there, winning a total of 6 major races. Only Rudolf Caracciola and Stirling Moss beat that record.

Elford lap records included: Targa Florio, Nürburgring, Daytona, Sebring, Norisring, Monza, Buenos Aires, Road Atlanta, Laguna Seca, Riverside and Le Mans.

On 4 February 1967 at Lydden Circuit, he won the first ever Rallycross event. Later that year he won the 84 Hour &quot;Marathon de la Route&quot; event at the Nürburgring, on the full 28 km long combined versions that was rarely used since the 1930s. Fellow pilots Hans Herrmann and Jochen Neerpasch preferred &quot;the rally driver&quot; to steer the Porsche 911 through the 7 hours long, four consecutive night turns in rainy and foggy conditions. The winning car was fitted with a semi-automatic Sportomatic transmission, as was another Porsche 911S entered by the factory team.
Although he raced five years for Porsche, Elford also raced for Ford, Triumph, Lancia, Alfa-Romeo, Ferrari, Chaparral, Shadow, Cooper, Lola, Chevron, and Subaru. He also drove McLaren in F1 &amp; CanAm, Chevrolet in TransAm.

Overseas, Elford was also racing in CanAm and the Daytona 500 of NASCAR.

On 25 January 2015, Elford received the 2015 Phil Hill Award from Road Racing Drivers Club. It was presented to him by club president Bobby Rahal.

==Personal life==
After retiring, Elford lived in South Florida in the United States. Elford died on 13 March 2022, at the age of 86. At the time of his death he had been suffering from cancer for roughly a year.

<text>Walter Edwin Hansgen (October 28, 1919 – April 7, 1966) was an American racecar driver. His motorsport career began as a road racing driver, he made his Grand Prix debut at 41 and he died aged 46, several days after crashing during testing for the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans.

==Racing career==

A four-time SCCA Road Racing Champ, Hansgen participated in two Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on October 8, 1961, at Watkins Glen, New York. He scored a total of two championship points. In 1964 he raced the MG Liquid Suspension Special, an Offenhauser-powered car, for Kjell Qvale, at the Indianapolis 500. He finished 13th in that race. He raced there again in 1965, in the MG-Huffaker-Offenhauser, when he finished 14th.

In addition to Formula One, Walt Hansgen was a dominant road racer from the early 1950s and 1960s, winning numerous races at VIR, the famed course at Bridgehampton, and Watkins Glen through to his death at Le Mans in France in 1966.

He drove for Briggs Cunningham and John Mecom. Hansgen won the Formula Junior race at the inaugural United States Grand Prix meeting at Sebring, Florida, on December 12, 1959, driving a Stanguellini. Hansgen won the Monterey Grand Prix, at Laguna Seca Raceway, on October 17, 1965, driving John Mecom&#x27;s Lola T70-Ford. He participated in several races of the 24 Hours of Daytona and Le Mans as well as the 12 Hours of Sebring endurance races. He also was notable for introducing Mark Donohue to professional road racing.

Hansgen was killed when he crashed a 7-liter Holman &amp; Moody Ford GT 40 Mk2 sports car while driving in the rain during the Le Mans tests on April 3, 1966. &quot;A Ford spokesman said Hansgen&#x27;s car appeared to have been aquaplaning on the wet track leaving no way for the driver to control it.&quot; Ford crew members later said that Hansgen had continued to push hard in the damp weather, although he had been warned by team manager Carroll Smith to take it easy. In Mark Donohue&#x27;s book, &quot;The Unfair Advantage&quot;, it is said that Hansgen tried to drive onto an escape road, only to find out too late that a barrier had been built across it for spectator safety.

<doc id="1235955" wikidata="Q6781291" url="?curid=1235955" title="Maryland Constitution of 1776">
<text>The Maryland Constitution of 1776 was the first of four constitutions under which the U.S. state of Maryland has been governed. It was that state&#x27;s basic law from its adoption in 1776 until the Maryland Constitution of 1851 took effect on July 4 of that year.

==Background and drafting==
In the months before the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, a group of powerful Marylanders formed an association that eventually took the form of a convention in Annapolis. This group made preparations to form a new government for Maryland and sent representatives to participate in the Continental Congress.

The eighth session decided that the continuation of an ad hoc government by the convention was not a good mechanism for governing the state and that a more permanent and structured government was needed. So, on July 3, 1776, they resolved that a new convention be elected that would be responsible for drawing up their first state constitution, one that did not refer to parliament or the king, but would be a government &quot;...of the people only.&quot;

On August 1, all freemen with property elected delegates for the Maryland Constitutional Convention of 1776. They began meeting on August 14, drafted the constitution, and adjourned on November 11. The document was not submitted to the people for ratification. The Assembly of Freemen would not meet again, as it was replaced by the new state government established by the 1776 constitution. Thomas Johnson became the state&#x27;s first elected governor.

==Declaration of Rights==

The document included a Declaration of Rights. This, among other things, ended the position of the Church of England as the state-supported religion, and granted all Christians, including Roman Catholics, freedom of worship. Free blacks who met the property qualifications continued to be eligible to vote. The declaration was more than a bill of rights, which enunciates certain rights which are reserved to the people. The declaration stated that all power emanated from the people and that the governors were accountable to the people.

== Creation of government ==

The 1776 constitution defined the Maryland General Assembly, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Maryland House of Delegates and Maryland State Senate. It acknowledged the power of county governments in administering their own affairs, and called for separate treasurers and land registrars on Maryland&#x27;s Eastern and Western Shores. The constitution stipulated that new amendments could be passed by two consecutive sessions of the house of delegates.

==Elections and the franchise==
Despite the declaration that all power emanates from the people, the document kept political power in the hands of the male citizens who met a minimum property requirement. When adopted, the 1776 constitution allowed 20,000 of the 300,000+ people living in Maryland to vote.

Slaves and women could not vote, nor did they have equal rights to men. Only Christians could hold office until 1826, when legislation was adopted allowing Jews to hold office and have equal rights and privileges with Christians.

They directly elected delegates to the Maryland General Assembly and indirectly elected State Senators. Voters would elect Senatorial Electors every five years. These men would then meet together to elect a fifteen-member Senate, nine members from the Western Shore and six from the Eastern Shore. If a Senate vacancy occurred between elections, the Senate selected a replacement. The Governor was elected by the joint legislature, not the people directly. And most local offices were appointed by the Governor, with the concurrence of his Executive Council.

==Subsequent history==
The 1776 constitution was amended 66 times, most notably in 1837, to, among other things, provide for a popularly elected governor, instead of one chosen by the legislature. The constitution was initially about 8,800 words long. The several amendments added to it between 1792 and 1846 brought its total length to about 15,200 words.

Black men who met the property requirement could vote until 1810, when the General Assembly ratified a constitutional amendment (approved by the 1809 assembly) to change &quot;freemen&quot; to &quot;free white men&quot; in Article 2 of the Constitution.

<text>A convection zone, convective zone or convective region of a star is a layer which is unstable due to convection. Energy is primarily or partially transported by convection in such a region. In a radiation zone, energy is transported by radiation and conduction.

Stellar convection consists of mass movement of plasma within the star which usually forms a circular convection current with the heated plasma ascending and the cooled plasma descending.

The Schwarzschild criterion expresses the conditions under which a region of a star is unstable to convection. A parcel of gas that rises slightly will find itself in an environment of lower pressure than the one it came from. As a result, the parcel will expand and cool. If the rising parcel cools to a lower temperature than its new surroundings, so that it has a higher density than the surrounding gas, then its lack of buoyancy will cause it to sink back to where it came from. However, if the temperature gradient is steep enough (i.e. the temperature changes rapidly with distance from the center of the star), or if the gas has a very high heat capacity (i.e. its temperature changes relatively slowly as it expands) then the rising parcel of gas will remain warmer and less dense than its new surroundings even after expanding and cooling. Its buoyancy will then cause it to continue to rise. The region of the star in which this happens is the convection zone.

==Main sequence stars==

In main sequence stars more than 1.3 times the mass of the Sun, the high core temperature causes nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium to occur predominantly via the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle instead of the less temperature-sensitive proton–proton chain. The high temperature gradient in the core region forms a convection zone that slowly mixes the hydrogen fuel with the helium product. The core convection zone of these stars is overlaid by a radiation zone that is in thermal equilibrium and undergoes little or no mixing. In the most massive stars, the convection zone may reach all the way from the core to the surface.

In main sequence stars of less than about 1.3 solar masses, the outer envelope of the star contains a region where partial ionization of hydrogen and helium raises the heat capacity. The relatively low temperature in this region simultaneously causes the opacity due to heavier elements to be high enough to produce a steep temperature gradient. This combination of circumstances produces an outer convection zone, the top of which is visible in the Sun as solar granulation. Low-mass main-sequence stars, such as red dwarfs below 0.35 solar masses, as well as pre-main sequence stars on the Hayashi track, are convective throughout and do not contain a radiation zone.

In main sequence stars similar to the Sun, which have a radiative core and convective envelope, the transition region between the convection zone and the radiation zone is called the tachocline.

==Red giants==
In red giant stars, and particularly during the asymptotic giant branch phase, the surface convection zone varies in depth during the phases of shell burning. This causes dredge-up events, short-lived very deep convection zones that transport fusion products to the surface of the star.

<text>Scientometrics is a subfield of informetrics that studies quantitative aspects of scholarly literature. Major research issues include the measurement of the impact of research papers and academic journals, the understanding of scientific citations, and the use of such measurements in policy and management contexts. In practice there is a significant overlap between scientometrics and other scientific fields such as information systems, information science, science of science policy, sociology of science, and metascience. Critics have argued that overreliance on scientometrics has created a system of perverse incentives, producing a publish or perish environment that leads to low-quality research.

== Historical development ==

Modern scientometrics is mostly based on the work of Derek J. de Solla Price and Eugene Garfield. The latter created the Science Citation Index and founded the Institute for Scientific Information which is heavily used for scientometric analysis. A dedicated academic journal, &quot;Scientometrics&quot;, was established in 1978. The industrialization of science increased the number of publications and research outcomes and the rise of the computers allowed effective analysis of this data. While the sociology of science focused on the behavior of scientists, scientometrics focused on the analysis of publications. Accordingly, scientometrics is also referred to as the scientific and empirical study of science and its outcomes.

The International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics founded in 1993 is an association of professionals in the field.

Later, around the turn of the century, evaluation and ranking of scientists and institutions came more into the spotlights. Based on bibliometric analysis of scientific publications and citations, the Academic Ranking of World Universities (&quot;Shanghai ranking&quot;) was first published in 2004 by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Impact factors became an important tool to choose between different journals. Rankings such as the Academic Ranking of World Universities and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings (THE-ranking) became an indicator for the status of universities. The &quot;h&quot;-index became an important indicator of the productivity and impact of the work of a scientist. However, alternative author-level metrics have been proposed.

Around the same time, the interest of governments in evaluating research for the purpose of assessing the impact of science funding increased. As the investments in scientific research were included as part of the U.S. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), a major economic stimulus package, programs like STAR METRICS were set up to assess if the positive impact on the economy would actually occur.

== Methods and findings ==
Methods of research include qualitative, quantitative and computational approaches. The main focus of studies have been on institutional productivity comparisons, institutional research rankings, journal rankings establishing faculty productivity and tenure standards, assessing the influence of top scholarly articles, and developing profiles of top authors and institutions in terms of research performance.

One significant finding in the field is a principle of cost escalation to the effect that achieving further findings at a given level of importance grow exponentially more costly in the expenditure of effort and resources. However, new algorithmic methods in search, machine learning and data mining are showing that is not the case for many information retrieval and extraction-based problems.

More recent methods rely on open source and open data to ensure transparency and reproducibility in line with modern open science requirements. For instance, the Unpaywall index and attendant research on open access trends is based on data retrieved from OAI-PMH endpoints of thousands of open archives provided by libraries and institutions worldwide.

Recommendations to avoid common errors in scientometrics include: select topics with sufficient data; use data mining and web scraping, combine methods, and eliminate &quot;false positives&quot;. It is also necessary to understand the limits of search engines (e.g. Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar) which fail to index thousands of studies in small journals and underdeveloped countries.

==Common scientometric indexes==
Indexes may be classified as article-level metrics, author-level metrics, and journal-level metrics depending on which feature they evaluate.

===Impact factor===

The impact factor (IF) or journal impact factor (JIF) of an academic journal is a measure reflecting the yearly average number of citations to recent articles published in that journal. It is frequently used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within its field; journals with higher impact factors are often deemed to be more important than those with lower ones. The impact factor was devised by Eugene Garfield, the founder of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI).

===Science Citation Index===

The Science Citation Index (SCI) is a citation index originally produced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) and created by Eugene Garfield. It was officially launched in 1964. It is now owned by Clarivate Analytics (previously the Intellectual Property and Science business of Thomson Reuters). The larger version (Science Citation Index Expanded) covers more than 8,500 notable and significant journals, across 150 disciplines, from 1900 to the present. These are alternatively described as the world&#x27;s leading journals of science and technology, because of a rigorous selection process.

===Acknowledgment index===
An acknowledgment index (British acknowledgement index) is a method for indexing and analyzing acknowledgments in the scientific literature and, thus, quantifies the impact of acknowledgments. Typically, a scholarly article has a section in which the authors acknowledge entities such as funding, technical staff, colleagues, etc. that have contributed materials or knowledge or have influenced or inspired their work. Like a citation index, it measures influences on scientific work, but in a different sense; it measures institutional and economic influences as well as informal influences of individual people, ideas, and artifacts.
Unlike the impact factor, it does not produce a single overall metric, but analyzes the components separately. However, the total number of acknowledgments to an acknowledged entity can be measured and so can the number of citations to the papers in which the acknowledgment appears. The ratio of this total number of citations to the total number of papers in which the acknowledge entity appears can be construed as the impact of that acknowledged entity.

== Altmetrics ==

In scholarly and scientific publishing, altmetrics are nontraditional bibliometrics proposed as an alternative or complement to more traditional citation impact metrics, such as impact factor and &quot;h&quot;-index. The term altmetrics was proposed in 2010, as a generalization of article level metrics, and has its roots in the #altmetrics hashtag. Although altmetrics are often thought of as metrics about articles, they can be applied to people, journals, books, data sets, presentations, videos, source code repositories, web pages, etc. Altmetrics use public APIs across platforms to gather data with open scripts and algorithms. Altmetrics did not originally cover citation counts, but calculate scholar impact based on diverse online research output, such as social media, online news media, online reference managers and so on. It demonstrates both the impact and the detailed composition of the impact. Altmetrics could be applied to research filter, promotion and tenure dossiers, grant applications and for ranking newly published articles in academic search engines.

== Criticisms ==

Critics have argued that overreliance on scientometrics has created a publish or perish environment with perverse incentives that lead to low-quality research.

== In popular culture ==
The main character in Michael Frayn’s novel Skios is a Professor of Scientometrics.

<text>Konstanty Plisowski of the Odrowąż coat of arms (8 June 1890 – 1940) was a Polish general and military commander. He was the Commander in the battle of Jazłowiec and the battle of Brześć Litewski. He was murdered on Stalin&#x27;s orders in the Katyn massacre.

== Biography ==

Konstanty Plisowski was born on 8 June 1890 in his family village of Nowosiółki in Podolia, to a family of szlachta ancestry of Odrowąż coat of arms. In 1908 he joined the Russian army, and served with distinction until 1917. During World War I, Plisowski was transferred to the 1st Polish Corps. Since 1917 served as a commander of the cavalry regiment attached to the Polish 4th Rifle Division under general Lucjan Żeligowski. After Poland regained her independence in 1918, he joined the Polish Army. The following year, during the Polish-Ukrainian War he was assigned to the 14th Uhlans Regiment as its commanding officer. He became famous as a cavalry commander after the Jazłowiec cavalry charge (11 July 1919) that became part of the popular culture as one of the synonyms of bravery.

During the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1920 Plisowski served as a commander of the 6th cavalry brigade and later of the 8th cavalry brigade. He was also briefly the commanding officer of Rómmel&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Division. He took part in the famous Battle of Komarów. After the war he remained in the army and served at various command posts. At the same time he was also a professor of tactics at the Higher War School in Warsaw. On 4 January 1929 he was promoted to generał brygady, but in 1930 was demobilised and retired due to his poor health.

During the Polish Defensive War of 1939 Plisowski found himself in Brześć, where he volunteered for the army. He was made the commander of the Brześć Fortress and managed to organise resistance against the advancing German XIX Panzer Corps of general Heinz Guderian. After the unconcluded Battle of Brześć, in which his four infantry battalions managed to halt the advance of four German divisions for four days, Plisowski retreated with his men and joined the forces of general Franciszek Kleeberg. He was assigned to the Cavalry Operational Group of general Władysław Anders as his deputy. On 24 September he was made the commanding officer of the Nowogródzka Cavalry Brigade, with which he fought both against Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.

On 28 September 1939 Plisowski was taken prisoner of war by the Soviets and sent to the Special NKVD Interrogation Camp for Polish PoWs in Starobielsk. Following the orders of Joseph Stalin, he was murdered at the District Directorate of the NKVD in Kharkov in the spring of 1940, aged forty-nine, in what became known as the Katyn Massacres, and buried in a nameless mass grave in Piatichatki, where the Cemetery of Victims of Totalitarianism in Kharkov was officially opened on June 17, 2000.

Since 20 March 1996, the Polish 6th Armoured Cavalry Brigade bears the name of General Plisowski.

====Other Polish generals murdered in Kharkov====

The victims of the Katyn Massacres include 20 or so Polish generals, among whom Leon Billewicz, Stanisław Haller, Aleksander Kowalewski, Kazimierz Łukoski, Franciszek Sikorski, Leonard Skierski, Piotr Skuratowicz were murdered at the same location as Pilowski.

<text>Walter Faulkner (February 6, 1918 – April 22, 1956) was an American racing driver from Tell, Texas. He moved to Milledgeville, Georgia at the age of two-and-a-half, and to Lake Wales, Florida at the age of eight. He then moved to San Diego, California in 1936. Faulkner competed mainly in the National Championship and in stock car races. In 1950 Faulkner became the first rookie to win pole position at the Indianapolis 500. He died in 1956 after a qualifying crash at a USAC Stock Car event in Vallejo, California.

Earlier in his career, Faulkner raced motorcycles, then switched to midget cars, later driving for the Edelbrock dirt track racing team. He had great success in midget car racing and was inducted into the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame in 2007. Faulkner was also inducted into the West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame in 2006.

==World Championship career summary==
The Indianapolis 500 was part of the FIA World Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indy during those years were credited with World Championship points and participation. Walt Faulkner participated in 5 World Championship races. He started on the pole 1 time, and accumulated a total of 1 championship point.

<text>Citation analysis is the examination of the frequency, patterns, and graphs of citations in documents. It uses the directed graph of citations — links from one document to another document — to reveal properties of the documents. A typical aim would be to identify the most important documents in a collection. A classic example is that of the citations between academic articles and books. For another example, judges of law support their judgements by referring back to judgements made in earlier cases (see citation analysis in a legal context). An additional example is provided by patents which contain prior art, citation of earlier patents relevant to the current claim. The digitization of patent data and increasing computing power have led to a community of practice that uses these citation data to measure innovation attributes, trace knowledge flows, and map innovation networks.

Documents can be associated with many other features in addition to citations, such as authors, publishers, journals as well as their actual texts. The general analysis of collections of documents is known as bibliometrics and citation analysis is a key part of that field. For example, bibliographic coupling and co-citation are association measures based on citation analysis (shared citations or shared references). The citations in a collection of documents can also be represented in forms such as a citation graph, as pointed out by Derek J. de Solla Price in his 1965 article &quot;Networks of Scientific Papers&quot;. This means that citation analysis draws on aspects of social network analysis and network science.

An early example of automated citation indexing was CiteSeer, which was used for citations between academic papers, while Web of Science is an example of a modern system which includes more than just academic books and articles reflecting a wider range of information sources. Today, automated citation indexing has changed the nature of citation analysis research, allowing millions of citations to be analyzed for large-scale patterns and knowledge discovery. Citation analysis tools can be used to compute various impact measures for scholars based on data from citation indices. These have various applications, from the identification of expert referees to review papers and grant proposals, to providing transparent data in support of academic merit review, tenure, and promotion decisions. This competition for limited resources may lead to ethically questionable behavior to increase citations.

A great deal of criticism has been made of the practice of naively using citation analyses to compare the impact of different scholarly articles without taking into account other factors which may affect citation patterns. Among these criticisms, a recurrent one focuses on &quot;field-dependent factors&quot;, which refers to the fact that citation practices vary from one area of science to another, and even between fields of research within a discipline.

==Overview==

While citation indexes were originally designed for information retrieval, they are increasingly used for bibliometrics and other studies involving research evaluation. Citation data is also the basis of the popular journal impact factor.

There is a large body of literature on citation analysis, sometimes called scientometrics, a term invented by Vasily Nalimov, or more specifically bibliometrics. The field blossomed with the advent of the Science Citation Index, which now covers source literature from 1900 on. The leading journals of the field are &quot;Scientometrics,&quot; &quot;Informetrics,&quot; and the &quot;Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology&quot;. ASIST also hosts an electronic mailing list called SIGMETRICS at ASIST. This method is undergoing a resurgence based on the wide dissemination of the Web of Science and Scopus subscription databases in many universities, and the universally available free citation tools such as CiteBase, CiteSeerX, Google Scholar, and the former Windows Live Academic (now available with extra features as Microsoft Academic). Methods of citation analysis research include qualitative, quantitative and computational approaches. The main foci of such scientometric studies have included productivity comparisons, institutional research rankings, journal rankings establishing faculty productivity and tenure standards, assessing the influence of top scholarly articles, tracing the development trajectory of a science or technology field, and developing profiles of top authors and institutions in terms of research performance.

Legal citation analysis is a citation analysis technique for analyzing legal documents to facilitate the understanding of the inter-related regulatory compliance documents by the exploration the citations that connect provisions to other provisions within the same document or between different documents. Legal citation analysis uses a citation graph extracted from a regulatory document, which could supplement E-discovery - a process that leverages on technological innovations in big data analytics.

==History==
In a 1965 paper, Derek J. de Solla Price described the inherent linking characteristic of the SCI as &quot;Networks of Scientific Papers&quot;. The links between citing and cited papers became dynamic when the SCI began to be published online. The Social Sciences Citation Index became one of the first databases to be mounted on the Dialog system in 1972. With the advent of the CD-ROM edition, linking became even easier and enabled the use of bibliographic coupling for finding related records. In 1973, Henry Small published his classic work on Co-Citation analysis which became a self-organizing classification system that led to document clustering experiments and eventually an &quot;Atlas of Science&quot; later called &quot;Research Reviews&quot;.

The inherent topological and graphical nature of the worldwide citation network which is an inherent property of the scientific literature was described by Ralph Garner (Drexel University) in 1965.

The use of citation counts to rank journals was a technique used in the early part of the nineteenth century but the systematic ongoing measurement of these counts for scientific journals was initiated by Eugene Garfield at the Institute for Scientific Information who also pioneered the use of these counts to rank authors and papers. In a landmark paper of 1965 he and Irving Sher showed the correlation between citation frequency and eminence in demonstrating that Nobel Prize winners published five times the average number of papers while their work was cited 30 to 50 times the average. In a long series of essays on the Nobel and other prizes Garfield reported this phenomenon. The usual summary measure is known as impact factor, the number of citations to a journal for the previous two years, divided by the number of articles published in those years. It is widely used, both for appropriate and inappropriate purposes—in particular, the use of this measure alone for ranking authors and papers is therefore quite controversial.

In an early study in 1964 of the use of Citation Analysis in writing the history of DNA, Garfield and Sher demonstrated the potential for generating historiographs, topological maps of the most important steps in the history of scientific topics. This work was later automated by E. Garfield, A. I. Pudovkin of the Institute of Marine Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences and V. S. Istomin of Center for Teaching, Learning, and Technology, Washington State University and led to the creation of the HistCite software around 2002.

Automatic citation indexing was introduced in 1998 by Lee Giles, Steve Lawrence and Kurt Bollacker and enabled automatic algorithmic extraction and grouping of citations for any digital academic and scientific document. Where previous citation extraction was a manual process, citation measures could now scale up and be computed for any scholarly and scientific field and document venue, not just those selected by organizations such as ISI. This led to the creation of new systems for public and automated citation indexing, the first being CiteSeer (now CiteSeerX, soon followed by Cora, which focused primarily on the field of computer science and information science. These were later followed by large scale academic domain citation systems such as the Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic. Such autonomous citation indexing is not yet perfect in citation extraction or citation clustering with an error rate estimated by some at 10% though a careful statistical sampling has yet to be done. This has resulted in such authors as Ann Arbor, Milton Keynes, and Walton Hall being credited with extensive academic output. SCI claims to create automatic citation indexing through purely programmatic methods. Even the older records have a similar magnitude of error.

==Citation analysis for legal documents==

Citation analysis for legal documents is an approach to facilitate the understanding and analysis of inter-related regulatory compliance documents by exploration of the citations that connect to other provisions within the same document or between different documents. Citation analysis uses a citation graph extracted from a regulatory document, which could supplement E-discovery - a process that leverages on technological innovations in big data analytics.

==Citation analysis for plagiarism detection==

==Citation analysis for natural language processing==
Natural language processing (NLP), a field at the intersection of artificial intelligence and linguistics is poised to substantially impact society through various innovations such as large language models. The impact on and of NLP has been extensively studied through citations. Researchers have analyzed various factors such as the cross-field influence between different fields, industry impact, temporal citation patterns, plagiarism, geographic location, and gender. Many studies show the field is becoming more insular, with a narrowing focus, reduced interdisciplinarity, and concentration of funding across few industry actors.

==Controversies==
*&quot;E-publishing&quot;: due to the unprecedented growth of electronic resource (e-resource) availability, one of the questions currently being explored is, &quot;how often are e-resources being cited in my field?&quot; For instance, there are claims that On-Line access to computer science literature leads to higher citation rates, however, humanities articles may suffer if not in print.
* &quot;Self-citations&quot;: it has been criticized that authors game the system by accumulating citations by citing themselves excessively.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1007/s11192-017-2330-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, it has been found that men tend to cite themselves more often than women.
*Citation pollution: the infiltration of retracted research, or fake research, being cited in legitimate research, but negatively impacting on the validity of the research. It is due to various factors, including the publication race and the concerning rise in unscrupulous business practices related to so-called predatory or deceptive publishers, research quality, in general, is facing different types of threats.
*&quot;Citation justice&quot; and &quot;citation bias&quot;: Because having others cite a publication helps the original author&#x27;s career prospects, and because the key works in some fields were published by men, by older scholars, and by white people, there have been calls to promote social justice by deliberately citing publications by people from marginalized backgrounds, or by checking citations for bias before publication.

<text>Francisco Sacco Landi (July 14, 1907 – June 7, 1989), better known as Chico, was a racing driver from São Paulo, Brazil. He participated in six Formula One World Championship &quot;Grands Prix&quot;, debuting on September 16, 1951. He scored a total of 1.5 championship points, awarded for his fourth-place finish in the 1956 Argentine Grand Prix, a drive he shared with Gerino Gerini. He was the first Brazilian ever to take part in a Formula One Grand Prix, and also the first to score points.

==History==
Landi came from a modest middle-class family of Italian origins, and got into racing through his father, who owned a garage in São Paulo. Along with Manuel de Teffé and Irineu Corrêa, he popularized motor racing in Brazil in the late mid-thirties. Landi had left school at eleven to work as a mechanic, and later began illegal street racing at nights, where he had frequent run-ins with the police. In 1934 he made his racing debut, at the second Rio Grand Prix in 1934. He led until eight laps from the finish, when his engine gave out. He was the most popular Brazilian driver of his time, as many considered Teffé, who was the son of a diplomat of Prussian heritage, a wealthy expat rather than an actual Brazilian, as he had started his racing career while living in Europe. When Corrêa, who ended up winning the 1934 Rio Grand Prix, died in a crash on the first lap of next year, Landi was left as the undisputed master of pre-war racing in Brazil. Landi went abroad in 1938, finishing eighth at Bern in what is generally considered the first Brazilian Grand Prix entry. Landi&#x27;s first Brazilian GP victory came at the 1941 Rio de Janeiro Grand Prix.

Landi was the first Brazilian driver to win a Grand Prix race, taking a Ferrari to victory at the Bari Grand Prix in 1948, run that year to Formula Two regulations. He also finished second in the 1952 (non-championship) Albi Grand Prix in a Ferrari 375.

Landi also won the 1960 Mil Milhas Brasil in an Alfa Romeo JK 2000, together with Christian &quot;Bino&quot; Heins. This was the first time that a Brazilian-made car won this prestigious race, rather than an American-based &quot;Carretera&quot; special.

<doc id="1235977" wikidata="Q778099" url="?curid=1235977" title="Dirichlet integral">
<text>In mathematics, there are several integrals known as the Dirichlet integral, after the German mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, one of which is the improper integral of the sinc function over the positive real number line.

formula_1

This integral is not absolutely convergent, meaning formula_2 has infinite Lebesgue or Riemann improper integral over the positive real line, so the sinc function is not Lebesgue integrable over the positive real line. The sinc function is, however, integrable in the sense of the improper Riemann integral or the generalized Riemann or Henstock–Kurzweil integral. This can be seen by using Dirichlet&#x27;s test for improper integrals. 

It is a good illustration of special techniques for evaluating definite integrals, particularly when it is not useful to directly apply the fundamental theorem of calculus due to the lack of an elementary antiderivative for the integrand, as the sine integral, an antiderivative of the sinc function, is not an elementary function. In this case, the improper definite integral can be determined in several ways: the Laplace transform, double integration, differentiating under the integral sign, contour integration, and the Dirichlet kernel. But since the integrand is an even function, the domain of integration can be extended to the negative real number line as well.

== Evaluation ==

=== Laplace transform ===
Let formula_3 be a function defined whenever formula_4 Then its Laplace transform is given by
formula_5
if the integral exists. 

A property of the Laplace transform useful for evaluating improper integrals is
formula_6
provided formula_7 exists.

In what follows, one needs the result formula_8 which is the Laplace transform of the function formula_9 (see the section &#x27;Differentiating under the integral sign&#x27; for a derivation) as well as a version of Abel&#x27;s theorem (a consequence of the final value theorem for the Laplace transform).

Therefore,
formula_10

=== Double integration ===

Evaluating the Dirichlet integral using the Laplace transform is equivalent to calculating the same double definite integral by changing the order of integration, namely,
formula_11
formula_12
The change of order is justified by the fact that for all formula_13, the integral is absolutely convergent.

=== Differentiation under the integral sign (Feynman&#x27;s trick)===
First rewrite the integral as a function of the additional variable formula_14 namely, the Laplace transform of formula_15 So let
formula_16

In order to evaluate the Dirichlet integral, we need to determine formula_17 The continuity of formula_18 can be justified by applying the dominated convergence theorem after integration by parts. Differentiate with respect to formula_19 and apply the Leibniz rule for differentiating under the integral sign to obtain
formula_20

Now, using Euler&#x27;s formula formula_21 one can express the sine function in terms of complex exponentials:
formula_22

Therefore,
formula_23

Integrating with respect to formula_24 gives
formula_25

where formula_26 is a constant of integration to be determined. Since formula_27 formula_28 using the principal value. This means that for formula_13 
formula_30

Finally, by continuity at formula_31 we have formula_32 as before.

=== Complex contour integration ===
Consider formula_33

As a function of the complex variable formula_34 it has a simple pole at the origin, which prevents the application of Jordan&#x27;s lemma, whose other hypotheses are satisfied.

Define then a new function
formula_35

The pole has been moved to the negative imaginary axis, so formula_36 can be integrated along the semicircle formula_37 of radius formula_38 centered at formula_39 extending in the positive imaginary direction, and closed along the real axis. One then takes the limit formula_40

The complex integral is zero by the residue theorem, as there are no poles inside the integration path formula_37:
formula_42

The second term vanishes as formula_38 goes to infinity. As for the first integral, one can use one version of the Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem for integrals over the real line: for a complex-valued function defined and continuously differentiable on the real line and real constants formula_44 and formula_45 with formula_46 one finds
formula_47

where formula_48 denotes the Cauchy principal value. Back to the above original calculation, one can write
formula_49

By taking the imaginary part on both sides and noting that the function formula_50 is even, we get
formula_51

Finally,
formula_52

Alternatively, choose as the integration contour for formula_18 the union of upper half-plane semicircles of radii formula_54 and formula_38 together with two segments of the real line that connect them. On one hand the contour integral is zero, independently of formula_54 and formula_57 on the other hand, as formula_58 and formula_59 the integral&#x27;s imaginary part converges to formula_60 (here formula_61 is any branch of logarithm on upper half-plane), leading to formula_62

=== Dirichlet kernel ===
Consider the well-known formula for the Dirichlet kernel:formula_63

It immediately follows that:formula_64

Define
formula_65

Clearly, formula_18 is continuous when formula_67 to see its continuity at 0 apply L&#x27;Hopital&#x27;s Rule:
formula_68

Hence, formula_18 fulfills the requirements of the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. This means:
formula_70

(The form of the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma used here is proven in the article cited.)

We would like to compute:
formula_71

However, we must justify switching the real limit in formula_72 to the integral limit in formula_73 which will follow from showing that the limit does exist.

Using integration by parts, we have:
formula_74

Now, as formula_75 and formula_76 the term on the left converges with no problem. See the list of limits of trigonometric functions. We now show that formula_77 is absolutely integrable, which implies that the limit exists.

First, we seek to bound the integral near the origin. Using the Taylor-series expansion of the cosine about zero,
formula_78

Therefore,
formula_79

for some constant formula_80 This shows that the integral is absolutely integrable, which implies the original integral exists, and switching from formula_72 to formula_82 was in fact justified, and the proof is complete.

<text>James Merwin &quot;Dick&quot; Rathmann (January 6, 1926February 1, 2000) was an American racing driver.

Rathmann and his younger brother swapped names while teenagers. He was an 18-year-old going by the name of Jim Rathmann, when his brother wanted to start racing. To help him enter races, he traded I.D.s with him, and assumed the identity of &quot;[[Jim Rathmann (racing driver)|Dick Rathmann]].&quot; The name change stuck for life in public circles.

He drove in the AAA Championship Car series in the 1949 and 1950 seasons with 4 starts, including the 1950 Indianapolis 500. He finished in the top ten once, in 6th position at Milwaukee in 1950.

In 1951, he moved to NASCAR, where he was a very successful Grand National driver through 1955.

In 1956, he returned to the USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1956–1964 seasons with an additional 41 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 races in 1956 and 1958–1964. He finished in the top ten 21 more times, with his best finish in 2nd position in 1959 at Daytona.

Rathmann sat on the pole for the 1958 Indianapolis 500. On the first lap, he and fellow front-row starter Ed Elisian raced into turn 3 and started a chain-reaction accident which involved 15 cars and claimed the life of Pat O&#x27;Connor. With that accident, Rathmann became the first Indy pole-sitter to complete no laps. This feat has been repeated only twice in Indy history, first by Roberto Guerrero and then by Scott Sharp.

Rathmann was the elder brother of 1960 Indianapolis 500 winner Jim Rathmann. The two switched names in 1946 so his younger brother could enter a race while underage. For what was supposed to be a short time, he adopted the name &quot;Dick&quot; and his brother adopted the name &quot;Jim&quot;. The change stuck for life.

In 2009, Rathmann was inducted into the West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame.

==World Championship career summary==
The Indianapolis 500 was part of the FIA World Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indy during those years were credited with World Championship points and participation. Dick Rathmann participated in 5 World Championship races. He started on the pole once and accumulated a total of 2 World Championship points.

<text>Duane Claude Carter (May 5, 1913 – March 7, 1993) was an American racecar driver. He raced midget cars, sprint cars, and IndyCars. Carter was born in Fresno, California, and he died in Indianapolis, Indiana. His son Pancho raced in Indy cars, along with Johnny Parsons (whom he helped raise).

==Racing career==

===Midget cars===
Carter started racing midgets at the 1/5 mile dirt track in the west side of Fresno while attending Fresno State University. He was one of six drivers who went to Western Springs Stadium in Auckland, New Zealand in 1937. He won the first ever midget car race at that track. The car he drove still exists in a museum in Auckland. He was a consistent winner on the Nutley board track in 1939 while future journalist Chris Economaki was his unofficial crew chief. He won the 1940 Detroit VFW Motor Speedway title, the 1942 championship at Sportsman Park in Cleveland. He captured a 500 lap victory in his midget car at the 1947 Los Angeles Coliseum Motordome after Danny Oakes was initially declared the winner.

===Sprint cars===
He moved up to the sprint cars, and won the 1950 Midwest division.

===Indy Cars===
He drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1948–1955, 1959–1960, and 1963 seasons with 47 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 races in each season. He finished in the top ten 23 times, with his best finish in 2nd position in 1953 at Phoenix. In his last race, at the Indy 500, he drove the innovative John Crosthwaite designed Harvey Aluminium Special ‘roller skate car’ with the then pioneering low profile, wide racing tyres and a stock Chevrolet engine.


==USAC director==
He retired from competition in 1956 to take the Competition Director position for USAC. He returned to competition in 1959 after Henry Banks took over the position.

==Career awards==
*Carter was inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame in 1967.
*He was inducted in the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 1991.
*He was inducted in the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame in 1989.

==Indianapolis 500 results==


* shared drive with Sam Hanks

<text>The Ashanti Goldfields Corporation is a gold mining company based in Ghana that was founded by Joseph Ellis and Joseph Biney both from Cape Coast. The Ashanti Mine, located at Obuasi, 56 km south of Kumasi, has been producing since 1897. During the turn of the century 1900, the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation was among the most important gold mining companies listed at the London Stock Exchange. The mine is sited on one of the world&#x27;s major gold deposits and is one of the ten largest in the world.

In 1994, the Ghana government, the majority shareholder, announced plans to sell 20-25 percent of its interest in AGC in a share flotation. The company was listed on the London and Ghana stock exchanges. It was the largest flotation ever organised by any gold mining company coordinating and advisory team alone numbered over 200 people. Each of the company&#x27;s 10,000 employees received five free shares.

In 1996 AGC was listed on the New York Stock Exchange to raise new capital, it was the first African company to appear on Wall Street. In 1999, the company succumbed to an ill-executed gold price hedge led by Goldman Sachs, which drove it to the brink of bankruptcy.

In 2004, it merged with AngloGold to create the world&#x27;s second-largest gold producer, AngloGold Ashanti company. AngloGold is based in South Africa and majority-owned by Anglo American group.

==Mines and production==
Gold production figures for the company&#x27;s mines in 2002 and 2003 were (in ounces per annum):

<doc id="1235986" wikidata="Q1140252" url="?curid=1235986" title="Pygame">
<text>Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.

==History==
Pygame was originally written by Pete Shinners to replace PySDL after its development stalled. It has been a community project since 2000 and is released under the free software GNU Lesser General Public License (which &quot;provides for Pygame to be distributed with open source and commercial software&quot;).

==Development of version 2==
Pygame version 2 was planned as &quot;Pygame Reloaded&quot; in 2009, but development and maintenance of Pygame completely stopped until the end of 2016 with version 1.9.1. After the release of version 1.9.5 in March 2019, development of a new version 2 was active on the roadmap.

Pygame 2.0 released on 28 October 2020, Pygame&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

==Features==
Pygame uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library, with the intention of allowing real-time computer game development without the low-level mechanics of the C programming language and its derivatives. This is based on the assumption that the most expensive functions inside games can be abstracted from the game logic, making it possible to use a high-level programming language, such as Python, to structure the game.

Other features that SDL does have include vector math, collision detection, 2D sprite scene graph management, MIDI support, camera, pixel-array manipulation, transformations, filtering, advanced freetype font support, and drawing.

Applications using Pygame can run on Android phones and tablets with the use of Pygame Subset for Android (pgs4a). Sound, vibration, keyboard, and accelerometer are supported on Android.

==Community==

Following disagreements between former core developers and the repository owner, a fork known as pygame-ce (Community Edition) was created.
There is a regular competition, called PyWeek, to write games using Python (and usually but not necessarily, Pygame). The community has created many tutorials for Pygame.

==Sample code==
The following code makes an image of a raccoon(&quot;raccoon.png&quot;) bounce when hitting an edge.

import pygame, sys
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1280, 720))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
clock.tick(30)
black = 0, 0, 0
raccoon = pygame.image.load(&quot;raccoon.png&quot;)
raccoon = pygame.transform.scale(raccoon, (200, 140))
raccoonrect = raccoon.get_rect()
velocity = [1,1]

while True:
 raccoonrect = raccoonrect.move(velocity)
 if raccoonrect.left &lt; 0 or raccoonrect.right &gt; 1280:
 velocity[0] = -velocity[0]
 raccoon = pygame.transform.flip(raccoon,True,False)
 if raccoonrect.top &lt; 0 or raccoonrect.bottom &gt; 720:
 velocity[1] = -velocity[1]
 for event in pygame.event.get():
 if event.type == pygame.QUIT: sys.exit()
 #screen update 
 screen.fill(black)
 screen.blit(raccoon, raccoonrect)
 pygame.display.flip()

==Notable games using Pygame==
* &quot;Frets on Fire&quot;
* &quot;Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble!&quot;

<doc id="1235987" wikidata="Q229982" url="?curid=1235987" title="4-Hydroxynonenal">
<text>4-Hydroxynonenal, or 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal or 4-HNE or HNE, (), is an α,β-unsaturated hydroxyalkenal that is produced by lipid peroxidation in cells. 4-HNE is the primary α,β-unsaturated hydroxyalkenal formed in this process. It is a colorless oil. It is found throughout animal tissues, and in higher quantities during oxidative stress due to the increase in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction, due to the increase in stress events. 4-HNE has been hypothesized to play a key role in cell signal transduction, in a variety of pathways from cell cycle events to cellular adhesion.

Early identification and characterization of 4-hydroxynonenal was reported by Esterbauer, et al., who also obtained the same compound synthetically. The topic has since been often reviewed, and one source describes the compound as &quot;the most studied LPO (lipid peroxidation) product with pleiotropic capabilities&quot;.

==Synthesis==
4-Hydroxynonenal is generated in the oxidation of lipids containing polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acids, such as arachidonic and linoleic acids, and of their 15-lipoxygenase metabolites, namely 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic and 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acids. Although they are the most studied ones, in the same process other oxygenated α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (OαβUAs) are generated also, which can also come from omega-3 fatty acids, such as 4-oxo-trans-2-nonenal, 4-hydroxy-trans-2-hexenal, 4-hydroperoxy-trans-2-nonenal and 4,5-epoxy-&quot;trans&quot;-2-decenal.

== Protein adducts ==
4-HNE can attach to proteins via a Michael addition reaction, which can target cysteine, histidine or lysine, or through the formation of a Schiff base, which can target arginine or lysine.

The lysine adduct ((4-HNE)-lysine or 4-hydroxynonenallysine) has been referred to as an &quot;oxidation-specific epitope&quot; and a lipid oxidation &quot;degradation product&quot;. It is generated by the oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein through the direct addition of carbonyl groups from 4-HNE onto lysine.

==Pathology==
These compounds can be produced in cells and tissues of living organisms or in foods during processing or storage, and from these latter can be absorbed through the diet. Since 1991, OαβUAs are receiving a great deal of attention because they are being considered as possible causal agents of numerous diseases, such as chronic inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, adult respiratory distress syndrome, atherogenesis, diabetes and different types of cancer.

There seems to be a dual and hormetic action of 4-HNE on the health of cells: lower intracellular concentrations (around 0.1-5 micromolar) seem to be beneficial to cells, promoting proliferation, differentiation, antioxidant defense and compensatory mechanism, while higher concentrations (around 10-20 micromolar) have been shown to trigger well-known toxic pathways such as the induction of caspase enzymes, the laddering of genomic DNA, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, with the eventual outcome of cell death (through both apoptosis and necrosis, depending on concentration). HNE has been linked to the pathology of several diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, cataract, atherosclerosis, diabetes and cancer.

The increasing trend to enrich foods with polyunsaturated acyl groups entails the potential risk of enriching the food with some OαβUAs at the same time, as has already been detected in some studies carried out in 2007. PUFA-fortified foods available on the market have been increasing since epidemiological and clinical researches have revealed possible effects of PUFA on brain development and curative and/or preventive effects on cardiovascular disease. However, PUFA are very labile and easily oxidizable, thus the maximum beneficial effects of PUFA supplements may not be obtained if they contain significant amounts of toxic OαβUAs, which as commented on above, are being considered as possible causal agents of numerous diseases.

Special attention must also be paid to cooking oils used repeatedly in catering and households because in those processes very high amounts of OαβUAs are generated and they can be easily absorbed through the diet.

==Detoxification and related reactions==
4-HNE has two reactive groups: the conjugated aldehyde and the C=C double-bond, and the hydroxy group at carbon 4. The α,β-unsaturated ketone serves as a Michael acceptor, adding thiols to give thioether adducts.

A small group of enzymes are specifically suited to the detoxification and removal of 4-HNE from cells. Within this group are the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) such as hGSTA4-4 and hGST5.8, aldose reductase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase. These enzymes have low Km values for HNE catalysis and together are very efficient at controlling the intracellular concentration, up to a critical threshold amount, at which these enzymes are overwhelmed and cell death is inevitable.

Glutathione S-transferases hGSTA4-4 and hGST5.8 catalyze the conjugation of glutathione peptides to 4-hydroxynonenal through a conjugate addition to the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, forming a more water-soluble molecule, GS-HNE. While there are other GSTs capable of this conjugation reaction (notably in the alpha class), these other isoforms are much less efficient and their production is not induced by the stress events which cause the formation of 4-HNE (such as exposure to hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet light, heat shock, cancer drugs, etc.), as the production of the more specific two isoforms is. This result strongly suggests that hGSTA4-4 and hGST5.8 are specifically adapted by human cells for the purpose of detoxifying 4-HNE to abrogate the downstream effects which such a buildup would cause.

Increased activity of the mitochondrial enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) has been shown to have a protective effect against cardiac ischemia in animal models, and the postulated mechanism given by the investigators was 4-hydroxynonenal metabolism.

==Export==
GS-HNE is a potent inhibitor of the activity of glutathione S-transferase, and therefore must be shuttled out of the cell to allow conjugation to occur at a physiological rate. Ral-interacting GTPase activating protein (RLIP76, also known as Ral-binding protein 1), is a membrane-bound protein which has high activity towards the transport of GS-HNE from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space. This protein accounts for approximately 70% of such transport in human cell lines, while the remainder appears to be accounted for by Multidrug Resistance Protein 1 (MRP1).

<text>Giorgio Scarlatti (2 October 1921 – 26 July 1990) was a racing driver from Italy. He participated in 15 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 13 May 1956.

==Formula One career==
Scarlatti was born in Rome. He got interested in racing right after the end of World War Two. His first outings were with a Maserati A6. In 1955 he entered the Naples Grand Prix at the wheel of a Ferrari 500 F2 and finishing fourth.

Scarlatti&#x27;s performance caught the eye of Maserati who decided to hire him for the 1957 Formula One season. Scarlatti&#x27;s best results were at the Pescara Grand Prix, where he narrowly missed out on the points-scoring positions when his Maserati 250F was overtaken in the latter stages by Stuart Lewis-Evans and the Italian Grand Prix, where he finished fifth, sharing the car with Harry Schell.

==Sports car racing==
In 1957 Scarlatti competed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, sharing a Maserati with Joakim Bonnier. Bonnier and Scarlatti were forced to retire after 7 hours due to a clutch problem. 

In 1958 he finished second at the Targa Florio together with Jean Behra on a Porsche 718. In 1961 Scarlatti and Lorenzo Bandini won the 4 Hours of Pescara on a Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa.

<text>Jack Rex Lewis (born 1 November 1936) is a British former racing driver, born in Stroud, Gloucestershire. 

==Career==
Lewis&#x27; racing career began in Formula Three. In 1958 Lewis bought a Formula Three Cooper-Norton from Cheltenham based Ivor Bueb and made his debut at Mallory Park, remarkably coming fourth. At Brands Hatch he made front page news for surviving a crash - a lucky photographer captured Jack’s upside-down Cooper showing Jack’s hand appearing to hold the car up. Just a week later he came first at Full Sutton and then won again at Oulton Park. In his first season in Formula 3 he raced 13 times - he won three of his races and was on the podium for a further four.

A year later, in a Formula Two Cooper-Climax Lewis won his first F2 race at Paris Montlhéry – winning by over two minutes. The following year Lewis&#x27; determination paid off and he took the F2 champion title – ahead of Australian World Champion Jack Brabham.

The following year, he tried his hand at Formula One and purchased a Cooper T53 from the Surbiton factory. He made his Grand Prix debut at the Belgian Grand Prix in Spa in June 1961. His maiden season showed much promise – qualifying often mid-grid and finishing ninth in his first ever race and at the Nürburgring. He achieved fourth in Italy.

Aside from Stirling Moss, Lewis was the only independent driver to score any points in 1961 and was listed as a Grade A driver for the following year.

In 1962 Lewis formed the Ecurie Galloise (Welsh Racing Team) sponsored by the Western Sporting Press and his father&#x27;s business H&amp;L Motors of Stroud - of which Lewis was now also a director. He bought a 1961/62 BRM V8 to race, but the car was unsatisfactory and eventually went back to the factory. He had no option but to return to his Cooper which he used the previous season. Although he achieved seventh place at the Dutch Grand Prix, it was overall a disappointing season for Lewis. The politics of F1 were beginning to affect him – he had been quicker than three works drivers at Monaco, yet had been denied a starting slot by the organisers. Lewis survived a few dangerous moments – losing a wheel at speed at Oulton Park and ramming Graham Hill in the French Grand Prix. He participated in 10 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix in all, scoring a total of three championship points.

By 1963, feeling despondent, Lewis retired from a promising racing career and took on a farm in Llandovery, Carmarthenshire where he bred Arab horses, and raised two daughters. After 18 years as a sheep farmer, in 1981, Lewis returned to Gloucestershire to help his father run H&amp;L Motors, a motorcycle business. In 1988 he fathered a son, Jack Lewis Jnr, and currently lives in his town of birth, Stroud, Gloucestershire.

<text>George Rice &quot;Joie&quot; Chitwood (April 14, 1912 – January 3, 1988) was an American stuntman, racing driver and businessman. He is best known as a daredevil in the Joie Chitwood Thrill Show.

== Early life ==

Chitwood was born in Denison, Texas. He was orphaned as a 14-year-old and he ended school after eighth grade. He lived in Topeka, Kansas during the Dust Bowl-era, and was seeking employment during the Great Depression. His main job was a shoe shiner; he also worked as a candy butcher for a burlesque show to earn additional income. He started learning a trade by helping at a welding shop.

== Racing career ==

=== Early career ===

Chitwood built his first race car from an Essex, driving the car after the driver failed to appear; he finished second. He started his racing career in 1934 at a dirt track in Winfield, Kansas. From there, he began racing big cars. In 1937 and 1938, he finished second in the Central States Racing Association (CSRA) season points standings. In 1939 and 1940 he switched to the American Automobile Association (AAA) East Coast Sprint car championship. He switched back to the CSRA and won its title in 1942, winning 14 consecutive CSRA features that season.

=== Championship and sprint car career ===

Between 1940 and 1950, Chitwood raced in the Indianapolis 500 seven times, finishing fifth on three occasions. He was the first man ever to wear a safety belt, beginning at the 1941 Indianapolis 500. Chitwood took the belt out of his dirt car because he liked how he was jostled around less, and could keep his foot on the throttle easier. Chitwood promised AAA officials Rex Mays and Wilbur Shaw that he would release the belt in the event of a crash, because drivers thought that it was safer to be thrown from a car during an accident. He won six major sprint car races in 1946. Chitwood won nine AAA East Coast features in 1947, including the first race at Williams Grove Speedway. He retired from racing in 1950.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Chitwood participated in one World Drivers&#x27; Championship race at Indianapolis. He finished in fifth place, scoring one World Drivers&#x27; Championship point.

=== Nickname ===
Chitwood was dubbed &quot;Joie&quot; during his racing career, after a newspaper reporter misheard and misspelled Chitwood&#x27;s name in an article. The writer confused St. Joe, Missouri (where Chitwood&#x27;s race car was built) with &quot;George&quot;, and when typesetting the article, added an &quot;i&quot; by mistake to spell &quot;Joie.&quot; The nickname stuck for life.

== The Joie Chitwood Thrill Show ==

In 1942, stuntman Lucky Teter died, and Chitwood took over the show after being asked by Teter&#x27;s widow to sell the equipment. Chitwood was unable to find a buyer during World War II. Chitwood was deemed 4-F, and taught welding at factories. He began operating what he called &quot;the Joie Chitwood Thrill Show.&quot; The show was an exhibition of auto stunt driving, and became so successful Chitwood cut back his racing endeavors significantly.

Often called &quot;Hell Drivers,&quot; Chitwood had five units that for more than forty years toured across North America, thrilling audiences in large and small towns alike with death-defying automobile stunts. Although not claiming to be of Native American descent, Chitwood often portrayed a character known as &#x27;Chief Wahoo.&#x27; Audiences found the act believable on account of Chitwood having a darker skin tone. He also performed a ramp-to-ramp jump, using a car that devised by Teter. Later on he and his son, Joie Jr., perfected driving a car on two wheels.

Chitwood&#x27;s show was so popular that in January 1967, their performance at the Islip Speedway in New York was broadcast on ABC television&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;.

Chitwood&#x27;s sons, Joie Jr. and Tim, both joined the thrill show, and continued to run it after their father&#x27;s retirement. The Chitwood show toured the U.S. from 1945 until 1998. On May 13, 1978, Joie Jr. set a world record when he drove a Chevrolet Chevette for on just two wheels.

=== Media appearances and legacy ===

Chitwood&#x27;s show was featured during season 3 of &quot;CHiPs&quot; in an episode entitled &quot;Thrill Show&quot;. Joie Jr. did stunts for &quot;Miami Vice&quot; on several occasions. Joie Jr. also appeared as a guest challenger on the TV game show &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot;. Joie Jr. worked in over 60 feature films and national commercials.

In 1983 Chitwood&#x27;s show was featured in the movie &quot;Smokey and the Bandit Part 3&quot;, where Sheriff Justice ends up the star of the show during his pursuit of The Bandit.

Chitwood&#x27;s show was credited by Evel Knievel as being his inspiration to become a daredevil when his show appeared in his home town of Butte, Montana.

World-champion auto dive bomber Dusty Russell began his 50+ year career as a stunt driver in 1951, when he performed at the age of 15 for Joie Chitwood&#x27;s Auto Daredevils show in Idaho.

Chitwood&#x27;s son Tim Chitwood became a highly prominent stunt driver and appeared in a number of movies. Chitwoods older son Joie Chitwood Jr., also worked as a stunt driver. In 2010, his grandson Joie Chitwood III became president of Daytona Speedway. 

== Hollywood Stuntman ==

Chitwood was frequently hired by Hollywood film studios to either do stunt driving for films or to act as auto-stunt coordinator. Chitwood was one of the stunt drivers in the Clark Gable and Barbara Stanwyck 1950 film about auto racing, &quot;To Please a Lady&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Chitwood&#x27;s wife, Marie, worked as a dancer; she quit dancing after their marriage. The couple had two sons, Timmy and Joie Jr., born 1944. Joie Jr. had a son Joie Chitwood III (born 1971). 

== Retirement and death ==

After Chitwood retired, his sons took over the business. Joie Chitwood died on January 3, 1988, in Tampa Bay, Florida.

== Legacy ==

Chitwood was named the President of the 100 Mile An Hour Club at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1967. The Eastern Auto Racing Club Old Timers Club inducted him in 1979, and he received the Walt Ader Memorial Award in 1986. He was inducted in the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 1993. Chitwood was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2010. Among his contributions to the sport was the supervision of the construction of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Selinsgrove Speedway in 1945.

<text>The Anthem of Bogotá is the musical composition that symbolizes the Colombia&#x27;s capital city. It was officially adopted through the decree 1000 of July 31, 1974.

==History==
The anthem&#x27;s lyrics were written by the poet Pedro Medina Avendaño and the music was composed by the musician Roberto Pineda Duque. The anthem was selected through a public concourse announced following the agreement 71 of 9 September 1967, whose judge was named by the decree number 731 of 3 July 1974 and the prize was 50.000 pesos. The judges of the concourse selected this song on 31 July 1974 and the mayor Anibal Fernandez de Soto signed the decree that declared the song as the official anthem of the city. Its debut was on 7 August 1974 in a concert made in the Jorge Eliecer Gaitan Theater.
The agreement 1 of April 19, 1988, fixes the rules for the use of the symbols of the city of Bogotá, the decree 120 of March 14, 1991, obligates the citizens to teach the symbols of the city in the educative centers and also to intone the anthem at every public event within the city. Finally the decree 64 of February 12 of 1993 requests every educative establishment to raise the city&#x27;s flag weekly along with the intonation of the anthem. Since the declaration of this decree, some football fans intone the anthem on every sport event, something that helps to promote the learning of the anthem among the youth of the city.

<doc id="1235999" wikidata="Q6410445" url="?curid=1235999" title="Kincardine Bridge">
<text>The Kincardine Bridge is a road bridge crossing the Firth of Forth from Falkirk council area to Kincardine, Fife, Scotland.

==History==

The bridge was constructed between 1932 and 1936, to a design by Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners, Consulting Engineers, and Architect, Donald Watson. It was the first road crossing of the River Forth downstream of Stirling, completed nearly thirty years before the Forth Road Bridge, which stands to the south-east. It first opened to traffic on 29 October 1936. Following a final opening on the 31 January 1988, the bridge was permanently closed, rendering it a fixed structure.

The bridge was constructed with a swinging central section which remained in use until 1988, that would allow larger ships to sail upstream to the small port at Alloa.

The bridge is part of the A985 road (formerly A876), and carries a single lane in each direction. Until the opening of the Clackmannanshire Bridge in 2008, it was the customary diversion route for traffic north from Edinburgh and eastern Scotland when the Forth Road Bridge was closed or under repair. As a result of the additional traffic using the bridge at these times, joining the high volume of regular commuter traffic, the town of Kincardine was frequently congested.

In 2023 work began to replace a section of the southern viaduct which had been assessed in 1984 as &#x27;substandard&#x27; and reinforced in 1992 with steel supports.
==Engineering==
Power for swinging the bridge was provided in the engine room, in the base of the centre pier, which was itself supplied with electricity from the Fife shore, by underwater cable. The swing section weighs 1,600 tons and rotates on a radial assembly of 60 solid cast steel rollers.

The entire bridge opening procedure was controlled from a beautifully maintained control room, which has retained all the original fittings and open switchboards. The control room is suspended in a superstructure of the swing section, above the road level.

The opening was controlled automatically, by the original GEC electrical switchgear.

In the engine room a 25 horsepower hydraulic pump was activated, retracting the wedges and blocking points. At this point, the central swing span would be free to rest on the rollers, thus the bridge was ready to swing. By this point, the safety gates would have also descended, blocking further traffic.

Two 50 horsepower, 440v electric motors induced rotation from large trains of gears on either side of the engine room. The initial opening process took around 2 minutes. The gearing produced a 171:1 reduction, and the bridge revolved slowly on a circular cast steel rack, with 224 machined teeth.

During the rotation, the entire 1,600 ton weight of the swing span rests upon 60 cast steel rollers in the central pier beneath the engine room. The rollers are 16 inches long, are tapered and have an average diameter of 20 inches. If the bridge was to sit with its full weight on the rollers for any length of time, the rollers would become distorted, preventing a smooth passage during the swinging process. It is for this reason that wedges are used to lift the bridge off the rollers, after each opening is completed.

While the bridge is now a fixed structure, the control and engine rooms are preserved by the Bo&#x27;ness Heritage Trust. The bridge was constructed in the open position, and during the opening ceremony in 1936, it was closed into its current position, to allow the first road vehicles to cross.

==The second bridge==
The original bridge, at over 70 years old, was identified by the Scottish Executive as being in need of replacement. The new Clackmannanshire Bridge was opened on 19 November 2008.
The original bridge was given Category A listed status by Historic Scotland in 2005, and was closed temporarily for upgrading works in 2011.

With the opening of the new bridge, the Kincardine Bridge was re-numbered as part of the A985 while the new Clackmannanshire Bridge became part of the re-routed A876, forming the Kincardine bypass.

===New York City===
The New York City Police Department&#x27;s Special Victims Unit, the Special Victims Division, investigates sex crimes. It is housed in separate Borough Patrols (Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn). The Special Victims Division only investigates the following types of cases:

* All children under 11 years of age who are the victim of abuse by a parent or person legally responsible for the care of the child.
* All children under 13 years of age who are the victim of a sex crime or attempted sex crime.
* All victims of rape or attempted rape.
* All victims of a criminal sexual act or attempted criminal sexual act.
* Victims of aggravated sexual abuse.
* Victims of sexual abuse 1st degree.

They also deal with children, disabled and elderly victims of non-sexual crimes who require special handling. The Special Victims Division does not investigate murder or child sexual exploitation material cases. Murders are investigated by the precinct detective squad in which the murder was committed and/or the borough homicide squad. Child sexual exploitation material cases are investigated by various computer crime squads and task forces. Robberies are investigated by precinct detective squads and/or borough robbery squads. If a sex crime is involved, the Special Victims Division may assist in the investigation.

In June 2022, the Justice Department announced a federal investigation into the division&#x27;s &quot;deficiencies&quot;, including “failing to conduct basic investigative steps and instead shaming and abusing survivors and re-traumatizing them during investigations.”

==In popular culture==
The American television show &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, the first spin-off in the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise, follows the cases of a fictional NYPD SVU division. Another American television show &quot;&quot; makes references to the Sex Crimes Unit, another name for Special Victims Unit.

<text>The Brixia Model 35 was an Italian small-sized, rapid-firing light mortar of World War II. The Brixia Modello 35 provided light supporting fire to the infantry companies. It was issued at battalion level, with each battalion containing nine mortars parceled out to each infantry company. It had a reasonable rate of fire but lacked power due to the small round. It was widely used and saw action on every major Italian front.

== Description ==

The Brixia light mortar is a 45 mm calibre light mortar mounted on a legged base and designed for operation by two crew. The rear legs are fitted with a pad for the gunner to lay forward behind the mortar or sit upon when the situation allows. A lever allowed for operating the breech and firing the weapon while the loader fed ammunition. Well-trained teams could reach up to 18 rounds per minute, although the operational rate of fire was less intense to avoid damage to the firing tube. The Brixia mortar differed from comparable World War II weapons in that it was trigger-fired with the help of separate ignition cartridges to be fed into a special magazine, making the weapon more similar to modern cannon mortars than conventional parabolic grenade launchers of the time.

At the tactical level, an infantry battalion had two platoons of 9 Brixia mortars assigned. Each Brixia mortar platoon was divided into three squads with three mortars each, distributed to the companies. The heavier 81mm mortar was assigned to the heavy weapons company of the regiment.

The Brixia was a complicated weapon but could lay down exact and intense fire curtains. This was offset by the shells, which fragmented poorly and, due to the limited calibre, had a very light and low-yield warhead. The weapon served on every front where Italian troops were involved (North Africa, Balkans, East Africa, Southern Russia, France) and was employed to defend the homeland against invading allied troops. During clashes between RSI formations and Italian partisans on both sides, due to many Italian partisans having a former military background, it was one of the few support weapons that could be found in the hands of the local Resistance. Mortars used by the German units fighting alongside the Italians were given the designation 4.5 cm GrW 176(i).

<text>Paul Frank Russo (April 10, 1914 – February 13, 1976) was an American racing driver.

== Racing career ==

=== Midget car career ===

Russo started racing midget cars in 1934. He went with a contingent of midget-car drivers to Hawaii in the winter of 1934–35. He was the 1938 AAA Eastern Midget Champion. Russo won the first race held at the Nutley Velodrome in New Jersey in 1938.

Russo was part of midget racing&#x27;s &quot;Chicago Gang&quot; with Emil Andres, Tony Bettenhausen, Duke Nalon, Cowboy O&#x27;Rourke, Jimmy Snyder, and Wally Zale. These racers toured tracks in the Midwest and East Coast of the United States. 

=== Indy car career ===

Russo drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1940–1941, 1946–1954, 1956–1959, and 1962 seasons with 81 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 every year excluding 1951 and 1952. He finished in the top ten 49 times, with two victories: at Springfield (1950) and Detroit (1951). He also won a non-points race at Williams Grove (1952). Russo&#x27;s best finish in the Indianapolis 500 was fourth, in 1957 when he was at the wheel of a Novi Special. In 1955, Russo co-drove with Tony Bettenhausen to a second-place finish.

Russo&#x27;s brother Joe and nephew Eddie also competed in Championship Car.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Russo participated in eight World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. He finished in the top three once, and set one fastest leader lap. He scored eight and one-half World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

== Death ==
On February 13, 1976, Russo died off the coast of Clearwater while in Florida for the Daytona 500. Russo is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana.

== Awards and honors ==

<text>Karl Edvard Tommy &quot;Slim&quot; Borgudd (; 25 November 1946 – 23 February 2023) was a Swedish musician and Formula One driver who raced for the ATS and Tyrrell teams.

==Biography==
Borgudd was born in Borgholm, Öland, on 25 November 1946.

His first career was as a drummer, mainly in jazz-rock, most notably for short-lived groups Lea Riders Group, Made In Sweden and Solar Plexus. He also worked with Björn Ulvaeus&#x27;s group the Hootenanny Singers.

Borgudd began racing on and off in the mid-1960s with a Lotus Formula Ford car, but his racing career became more serious only in 1972, after taking five wins in five sports car racing club events. Borgudd raced a Hillman Imp and a Volvo 122 in the Swedish Touring Car Championship from 1972 to 1975, finishing as runner-up in 1972, as well as racing in the Scandinavian Formula Ford series, which he won in 1973.

In 1976, Borgudd moved up to Formula 3, racing sporadically until the end of the 1977 season. In 1978, he formed his own team and raced full-time in the Swedish and European series, in an old Ralt-Toyota, which he took to the Swedish championship title in 1979, also finishing third in the European series. Failing to move to Formula 2 in 1980, he raced only in the F3 Monaco Grand Prix, where he reached third place before the bodywork became loose, forcing Borgudd to finish the race holding the body together with one hand.

In 1981, Borgudd, now 34, finally entered Formula 1 in ATS, making his debut in the San Marino Grand Prix, where he outqualified his teammate Jan Lammers. Although there was no cash sponsorship, Borgudd placed the ABBA logo on the car&#x27;s sidepods, a hopeful move to attract other investors that generated a lot of media interest. Following a run of non-qualifications, Borgudd managed to finish sixth in the British Grand Prix, scoring his first world championship point. In spite of the added morale boost, ATS proved to be an uncompetitive car, and Borgudd failed to score any more points for the rest of the season.

Borgudd&#x27;s performance in 1981 was solid enough to persuade Ken Tyrrell to hire him to partner Michele Alboreto for 1982. However, Borgudd did not adapt to his new team, and was unceremoniously dumped when his sponsorship money ran out three races into the season.

From 1983 to 1985, Borgudd raced only on occasion, including his taking part in the 1984 and 1985 Macau Grand Prix.

In 1985 he returned to race in F3000, which had replaced Formula 2. This championship allowed previous years Formula 1 cars, such as the Arrows A6 he drove, finishing tenth in the Vallelunga race. He entered five races that season, but the old F1 cars were not competitive compared to the purposely built F3000 cars.

Although he took part in the 1987 24 Hours of Le Mans, and in 1989 had an outright win in the Willhire 24 Hour, a minor touring car race where he drove a Ford Sierra, the Swede made his mark in truck racing the following years. In 1986 and 1987, Borgudd was champion in Divisions 2 and 3 of the European Truck Racing Championship, respectively. The following years, success was more fleeting, although the Scandinavian driver managed to finish the 1992 Class B championship in third place.

A switch to the in 1994 saw him take the championship title. The Mazda team, run by Roger Dowson Engineering made plans to return with Borgudd to the British Touring Car Championship in 1995, but the plan was scrapped.

Also in 1994, Borgudd went back to top form in the Truck Racing Cup, where the Swede barely lost the championship title to British driver Steve Parrish, after a dogfight that lasted the entire season. Borgudd responded in kind in 1995, beating Parrish and Markus Oestreich by a large margin. In 1996 and 1997, Borgudd only finished in fifth and fourth, and he announced his retirement after accusing Mercedes-Benz of favoring other drivers. He made occasional returns to racing at amateur level, having settled down in Coventry.

Borgudd died on 23 February 2023 at age 76.

<text>Iford Manor () is a manor house in Wiltshire, England. It is a Grade II* listed building sitting on the steep, south-facing slope of the Frome valley, in Westwood parish, about southwest of the town of Bradford-on-Avon. Its Grade I registered gardens are open to the public from April to September each year.

Iford was rated as among the &quot;20 most beautiful villages in the UK and Ireland&quot; by Condé Nast Traveler in 2020, with the manor taking &quot;center stage&quot;.

==History==
There has been a dwelling here since the Domesday Book and the origins of the present house are as early as the late fifteenth century or the early sixteenth. At that time the buildings were a wool factory and the seat of the Horton family who became a wool dynasty. Thereafter the Hungerford family of nearby Farleigh Hungerford Castle and Corsham Court lived here. Following a change in ownership the classical the building was remodelled; the façade was added around 1725–30.

Three generations of the Gaisford family lived here in the Georgian period, notably Dean Gaisford of Christ Church, Oxford; his father John had purchased the property in 1777.

Previously, the estate was owned by the Chandler family who was responsible for the modifications in the early eighteenth century. The Gaisfords created pleasure grounds with a park and woodland. In approximately 1820, the Gaisford family bought an old house in the area (later demolished) in order to extend the grounds of their manor. The Gaisford family owned the estate until 1853 and were responsible for planting the hanging woodlands above the garden and several of the notable trees in the garden and surrounding landscape. The Rooke family lived here until Harold Peto purchased the property in 1899. After Peto&#x27;s death, the estate was inherited by family and was sold in 1965 to Elizabeth Cartwright (later, Cartwright-Hignett). Her restoration of the garden was completed in the early 1970s.

The family (William and Marianne Cartwright-Hignett) retained ownership of the manor as of October 2020. The gardens were open to visitors for many years but were closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A coffee shop was being added, to open in April 2021; the tea room continued in operation. In 2020, the cloister and Georgian summer house were repaired to prevent their collapse.

==Gardens==

Iford is best known for its beautiful gardens, which are designated Grade I in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens by Historic England. They were designed during the early part of the twentieth century by the garden architect Harold Peto. He lived at Iford from 1899 until his death in 1933 during which time he built up an extensive collection of antiquities and artefacts, brought back from his travels abroad. His great love of the Italian garden style is plainly evident at Iford, where flowers occupy a subordinate place amongst the more structural elements of cypress, statuary, hedges, water features and broad walks.

According to &quot;Country Life&quot;, Peto was searching for a country home that would lend itself to a great garden design. When he found the Palladian villa in Wiltshire, &quot;it was evocative of his favourite... the Villa Giusti at Verona. ... He avoided unnecessary change to the garden, preferring instead to develop the inherent character, the natural beauty and the historic atmosphere&quot;.

A number of plants of particular interest can be found at Iford: standard &quot;Wisteria sinensis&quot; blossoms across much of the front of the house and up flights of steps linking the terraces (particularly good in late May); &quot;Phillyrea latifolia&quot;; &quot;Buxus sempervirens&quot; grows in wild tree form in the woods above the house and is extensively used in the gardens as a structural plant; &quot;Cupressus sempervirens&quot;; &quot;Hemerocallis citrina&quot;, the scented daylily; the naturalised Martagon lily.

In addition to his planting and structural work, Peto created a number of architectural garden features, which remain well preserved. Behind the manor house, to which he added a loggia, terraces lead up to the main lawn. Alongside the lawn he built a lily pool, a colonnade-lined Great Terrace, and the Cloisters, a Grade II* listed Italianate courtyard surrounded by an arcade, which was his &quot;Haunt of Ancient Peace&quot; where he displayed many of his treasures. Higher up the hillside, he built more terraces with retaining walls, and a pavilion called the Casita.

Thought lost after the war, the present owners since 1965, the Cartwright-Hignett family, have restored the garden and the various structures therein, initially assisted by Lanning Roper. John Hignett has extended the garden, including the creation of a Japanese Garden. The owners appointed Troy Scott Smith in 2019, previously head gardener of Sissinghurst, Bodnant and The Courts, to help replant and expand the garden further.

Iford Manor was the recipient of the Historic Houses Association/Christie&#x27;s Garden of the Year Award in 1998, and the Little Treasure of Britain Award in the 2017 Group Travel Awards.

==Arts and filming==
Iford Manor has been used for filming on a number of occasions. Most recently it was used as a key location for &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (2020) and in Sanditon (ITV 2019). In 2008 the gardens and the cloisters were used as the venue for the wedding sequence in Episode 1 of the second series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Mistresses&quot;.

Regular concerts take place at weekends in the garden at no extra charge for garden visitors, and from 2021 a new season of arts events will take place.

From 1983 until 2018, the Iford Arts Festival held a three-month season of opera, jazz and other concerts in the gardens, making use of the Cloisters and the Casita as performance spaces. With urgent repair work needed to the cloisters following subsidence, and the festival having outgrown the relatively small venue, the festival was moved to nearby Belcombe Court from 2019.

==Iford Manor SSSI==
The roof spaces of Iford Mill Barn are used as a summer breeding roost by greater horseshoe bats, one of only 14 known roosts for this species in England. This is the second largest of the known English breeding roosts, with over 250 individuals recorded each summer. Because of this, the buildings and a small area of land surrounding them, , were notified as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1996. Although the manor itself is in Wiltshire, both bat breeding sites are in Bath and Northeast Somerset, and so fall within English Nature&#x27;s Avon Area of Search. The SSSI includes an orchard, where Daubenton&#x27;s bat and Noctule bat roost.

<doc id="1236021" wikidata="Q115778" url="?curid=1236021" title="Toulo de Graffenried">
<text>Baron Emmanuel Leo Ludwig &#x27;Toulo&#x27; de Graffenried (18 May 1914, Paris, France – 22 January 2007, Lonay, Switzerland) was a Swiss motor racing driver. He participated in 23 World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 13 May 1950, and scored a total of nine championship points. He also participated in numerous non-Championship Formula One races.

De Graffenried was born in Paris, the son of Swiss Baron Leo de Graffenried and his American wife Irma Stern. He began his racing career in 1936, driving his own Maserati voiturette. Some of his most memorable results came at his home track: the challenging, cobbled, street circuit at Bremgarten near Bern. He won the 1949 British Grand Prix, a year before the FIA World Championship began. In that inaugural year, de Graffenried contested four of the season&#x27;s seven races, with mixed results. He continued to drive in occasional races over the next six years, with his best finish being fourth place at the 1953 Belgian Grand Prix.

Following his retirement from racing, de Graffenried managed his car dealership in Lausanne, featuring Alfa Romeo, Rolls-Royce and Ferrari automobiles. He also acted as stunt double for Kirk Douglas during the filming of &quot;The Racers&quot;. Later, he became a common figure at Formula One events during the 1970s and 1980s, as the corporate ambassador for Phillip Morris&#x27; Marlboro cigarette brand.

In recognition of his win at the first British Grand Prix, de Graffenried made his last appearance at the wheel of a racing car during the 1998 celebrations of Silverstone&#x27;s 50th anniversary at age 84.

He was the last surviving driver to have competed in the first World Championship Formula One Grand Prix.

<doc id="1236023" wikidata="Q16850463" url="?curid=1236023" title="John Chinaman">
<text>John Chinaman was a stock caricature of a Chinese laborer seen in cartoons of the 19th century. Also referenced by Mark Twain and popular American songs of the period, John Chinaman represented, in western society, a typical persona of China. He was typically depicted with a long queue and wearing an Asian conical hat.

== History ==
John Chinaman minstrel songs from the 1850s presented Chinese men as effeminate and unmanly. Such songs frequently revolved around John Chinaman&#x27;s failed pursuit of white women.

American political cartoonist Thomas Nast, who often depicted John Chinaman, created a variant, John Confucius, to represent Chinese political figures. 
In Nast&#x27;s cartoon &quot;A Matter of Taste&quot;, published March 15, 1879 (&quot;seen at right&quot;), John Confucius expresses disapproval of Senator James G. Blaine for his support of the Chinese Exclusion Act. Blaine is shown dining in &quot;Kearney&#x27;s Senatorial Restaurant&quot;—a reference to Denis Kearney, the leader of a violent anti-Chinese movement in California. John Confucius asks, &quot;How can Christians stomach such diet?&quot;

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the term first emerged with British sailors who, uninterested in learning how to pronounce the names of the Chinese stewards, firemen, and sailors who worked as part of their crews, came up with the generic nickname of &quot;John&quot;.

<text>Andrew Logan &quot;Andy&quot; Linden (April 5, 1922 – February 11, 1987) was an American racecar driver.

==Early life and military service==
Linden was born on April 5, 1922, in Brownsville, Pennsylvania. He served in the United States Navy, where he was a standout boxer, and the National Guard. He also rode hot rods in Los Angeles, California.

==Career==
He raced with great success until a 1957 crash caused a piece of metal to break his helmet, causing career ending brain damage. He is also technically a former Formula One World Championship driver, as the Indianapolis 500 was part of the FIA World Championship from 1950 through 1960, meaning that drivers competing at Indy during those years were credited with World Championship points and participation. Linden thus participated in 7 World Championship races, accumulating a total of 5 championship points.

in 2013, he was inducted into the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame.

He died in Harbor City, California, on February 11, 1987, and is buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood.

<doc id="1236035" wikidata="Q6376662" url="?curid=1236035" title="Kathleen Best">
<text>Colonel Matron Kathleen Annie Louise Best, (28 August 1910 – 15 November 1957) was the first director of the Women&#x27;s Royal Australian Army Corps.

==Early life==
Best was born at Summer Hill in Sydney on 28 August 1910. Best was educated in Sydney and undertook nursing training at Western Suburbs Hospital and midwifery training in the Crown Street Women&#x27;s Hospital. Having completed her training, Best nursed at Wyong Hospital on the New South Wales central coast, was appointed Acting Matron at the Rachel Forster Hospital in Sydney and later Deputy-Matron at the Masonic Hospital in Ashfield.

==Second World War==
Best&#x27;s military nursing career began with her appointment to the Australian Army Nursing Service on 30 May 1940, during the Second World War. She was posted as matron to the 2/5th Australian General Hospital and embarked for the Middle East in October that year. After opening in Palestine in December 1940, the hospital moved to Greece in April 1941. During the short-lived campaign, Best – the senior matron in Greece – and her colleagues endured regular German air raids. Best and 39 colleagues volunteered to remain in Greece after the evacuation knowing that they risked captivity. Within hours of deciding to stay, however, they too were ordered to leave, the last Australian nurses to do so. They survived further German air attacks on their ship before reaching Crete and later Alexandria, Egypt. Best was awarded the Royal Red Cross for her service in the Greek campaign.

The 2/5th Australian General Hospital was then re-established in Palestine and reorganised under Best&#x27;s supervision, but in August 1941 moved again, this time to Eritrea on the African coast. By March 1942 Best had returned to Australia, where her appointment to the AIF was terminated in mid-June. This, however, was not the end of her contribution to Australia&#x27;s war effort. A month after leaving the AIF she became the Controller of full-time Voluntary Aid Detachments, which in September became part of the Australian Army Medical Women&#x27;s Service.

Best held this post for seven months until she received a promotion to lieutenant colonel in February 1943 and was posted as Assistant Adjutant General (Women&#x27;s Services) at Land Headquarters in Melbourne, Australia. In September 1944, she became Assistant Director of Women&#x27;s Re-establishment and Training for the Department of Postwar Reconstruction. Among her responsibilities was the task of assisting servicewomen and female war-workers to adjust to civilian life once the war ended.

==Later life==
On 12 February 1951, Best became the founding Director of the Australian Women&#x27;s Army Corps, which was shortly after given the designation &quot;Royal&quot;. In September 1952 she reached the rank of honorary colonel and four years later, in 1956, appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire. In 1954 Best became chairman of the Red Cross Button Day committee in Melbourne. Despite her achievements Best has been described as a modest woman with an engaging sense of humour. Those who served under her considered Best an inspiring leader who ruled with a firm hand, but who also treated her subordinates with fairness. A memorial gateway commemorating her service was constructed at the entrance to the WRAAC School at George&#x27;s Heights in Sydney, Australia.

==Death==
Best became ill and died of melanomatosis on 15 November 1957, aged 47, at Epworth Hospital in Richmond, Melbourne.

<doc id="1236041" wikidata="Q41318" url="?curid=1236041" title="Cucumis metuliferus">
<text>Cucumis metuliferus commonly called the African horned cucumber (shortened to horned cucumber), horned melon, spiked melon, jelly melon, or kiwano, is an annual vine in the cucumber and melon family Cucurbitaceae. Its fruit has horn-like spines, hence the name &quot;horned melon&quot;. The ripe fruit has orange skin and lime-green, jelly-like flesh. &quot;C. metuliferus&quot; is native to Southern Africa, in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Angola.

== Consumption and other uses ==
Kiwano is a traditional food plant in Africa. Along with the gemsbok cucumber (&quot;Acanthosicyos naudinianus&quot;) and &quot;tsamma&quot; (citron melon), it is one of the few sources of water during the dry season in the Kalahari Desert. In northern Zimbabwe, it is called &quot;gaka&quot; or &quot;gakachika&quot;, and is primarily used as a snack or salad, and rarely for decoration. It can be eaten at any stage of ripening.

C. metuliferus may be used as a rootstock (via grafting) for melon to prevent both growth reduction and a strong nematode buildup in M. incognita-infested soil.

The fruit&#x27;s taste has been compared to a combination of banana and passionfruit, cucumber and zucchini or a combination of banana, cucumber and lime. A small amount of salt or sugar can increase the flavor, but the seed content can make eating the fruit less convenient than many common fruits.

Some also eat the peel, which is very rich in vitamin C and dietary fiber.

==Germination==
Germination is optimal between 20 and 35°C. Germination is delayed at 12°C, totally inhibits at seed stratification, and greatly inhibits above 35°C. Salinity increases the time required for full germination. The sowing dates greatly influence fruit yield and flowering.

==Pests and diseases==
Kiwano is resistant to several root-knot nematodes; two accessions were found to be highly resistant to watermelon mosaic virus, but very sensitive to the squash mosaic virus. Some accessions were found to succumb to &quot;Fusarium&quot; wilt. Resistance to greenhouse whitefly was reported. Kiwano was reported to be resistant to powdery mildew, but in Israel, powdery mildew and squash mosaic virus attacked kiwano fields and control measures had to be taken.

== Fruit development ==
During 28 days of development on the plant, fresh weight, electrical conductivity and titratable acidity of fruits do not change, pH rises and then falls, and concentrations of reducing sugars and total soluble solids increases. In the same period, peel colour changes from green through whitish green to yellow and finally to orange, and the pigment profile shows a decline in pigments absorbing at 431 and 663 nm, and a rapid increase in those absorbing at 442 and 470 nm.

<doc id="1236046" wikidata="Q233192" url="?curid=1236046" title="Louise of Savoy">
<text>Louise of Savoy (11 September 1476 – 22 September 1531) was a French noble and regent, Duchess &quot;suo jure&quot; of Auvergne and Bourbon, Duchess of Nemours and the mother of King Francis I and Marguerite of Navarre. She was politically active and served as the regent of France in 1515, in 1525–1526 and in 1529, during the absence of her son.

==Family and early life==
Louise of Savoy was born at Pont-d&#x27;Ain, the eldest daughter of Philip II, Duke of Savoy and his first wife, Margaret of Bourbon. Her brother, Philibert II, Duke of Savoy, succeeded her father as ruler of the duchy and head of the House of Savoy. He was, in turn, succeeded by their half-brother Charles III, Duke of Savoy.

Because her mother died when she was only seven, she was brought up by Anne de Beaujeu, who was regent of France for her brother Charles VIII. At Amboise she met Margaret of Austria (daughter of Maximilian and Mary of Burgundy), who was betrothed to the young king and with whom Louise would negotiate peace several decades later.

==Marriage==
At age eleven, Louise married Charles of Orléans, Count of Angoulême, on 16 February 1488 in Paris. She only began living with him when she was fifteen, though. Despite her husband having two mistresses, the marriage was not unhappy and they shared a love for books.

The household of Charles was presided over by his châtelaine Antoinette de Polignac, Dame de Combronde, by whom he had two illegitimate daughters, Jeanne of Angoulême and Madeleine. Antoinette became Louise&#x27;s lady-in-waiting and confidante. Her children were raised alongside Louise&#x27;s own. Charles had another illegitimate daughter, Souveraine, by Jeanne le Conte, who also lived in the Angoulême chateau. She would later arrange marriages for her husband&#x27;s illegitimate children.

Their first child, Marguerite, was born on 11 April 1492; their second child, Francis, was born on 12 September 1494.

When her husband fell ill after going out riding in the winter of 1495, she nursed him and suffered much grief when he died on 1 January 1496.

==Widowed and motherhood==
When she was widowed at the young age of 19, Louise deftly manoeuvred her children into a position that would secure for each of them a promising future. Though they remained in Cognac for two years, she moved her family to court at the ascension of King Louis XII, her husband&#x27;s cousin.

Louise had a keen awareness of the intricacies of politics and diplomacy, and was deeply interested in the advances in arts and sciences in Renaissance Italy. She made certain that her children were educated in the spirit of the Italian Renaissance, also helped by her Italian confessor, Cristoforo Numai from Forlì. She commissioned books specifically for them and she taught Francis Italian and Spanish.

When Louis XII became ill in 1505, he determined that Francis should succeed him and that both Louise and his wife Anne of Brittany should be part of the regency council. He recovered and Francis became a favourite of the king, who eventually gave him his daughter Claude of France in marriage on 8 May 1514. Following the marriage, Louis XII designated Francis as his heir.

==Mother of the King==
With the death of Louis XII on 1 January 1515, Francis became king of France. On 4 February 1515, Louise was named Duchess of Angoulême, and on 15 April 1524, Duchess of Anjou.

===The Bourbon inheritance===
Her mother having been one of the sisters of the last dukes of the main branch of Bourbon, after the death of Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon, in 1521, Louise, on basis of proximity of blood, advanced claims to the Duchy of Auvergne and other possessions of the Bourbons. This led her (supported by her son) in rivalry against Charles III, Duke of Bourbon, Suzanne&#x27;s widower, whom she proposed to marry in order to settle the Bourbon inheritance issue. When her suit was insultingly rejected by Charles, Louise instigated efforts to undermine him. This led to Charles&#x27; exile and his attempt to regain his lost status by waging war against the King. He died in 1527 having failed to regain his lost lands and titles. Louise recovered Auvergne from confiscations and became duchess in the name of her son.

===Regent===
Louise of Savoy remained politically active on behalf of her son in the early years of his reign especially. During his absences, she acted as regent on his behalf. Louise served as the Regent of France in 1515, during the king&#x27;s war in Italy, and again from 1525 to 1526, when the king was at war and during his time as a prisoner in Spain.

In 1524, she sent one of her servants, Jean-Joachim de Passano, to London to open unofficial negotiations with Cardinal Wolsey for a peace treaty; the negotiations were not a success, although they may have prepared the ground for the Treaty of the More the following year.
She initiated friendly relations with the Ottoman Empire by sending a mission to Suleiman the Magnificent requesting assistance, but the mission was lost on its way in Bosnia. In December 1525, a second mission was sent, led by John Frangipani, which managed to reach Constantinople, the Ottoman capital, with secret letters asking for the deliverance of King Francis I and an attack on the Habsburg. Frangipani returned with a positive answer from Suleiman, on 6 February 1526, initiating the first steps of a Franco-Ottoman alliance.

She was the principal negotiator for the Treaty of Cambrai between France and the Holy Roman Empire, which concluded on 3 August 1529. That treaty, called &quot;the Ladies&#x27; Peace&quot;, put an end to the second Italian war between the head of the Valois dynasty, Francis I of France, and the head of the Habsburg dynasty, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The Treaty temporarily confirmed Habsburg hegemony in Italy. The treaty was signed by Louise of Savoy for France and her sister-in-law, Margaret of Austria, for the Holy Roman Empire.

== Death ==
Louise of Savoy died on 22 September 1531, in Grez-sur-Loing of the plague. Her remains were entombed at Saint-Denis in Paris. After her death, her lands, including Auvergne, merged in the crown. Through her daughter Marguerite (Queen of Navarre) and her granddaughter Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, she is the ancestress of the Bourbon kings of France, as her great-grandson, Henry of Navarre, succeeded as Henry IV of France.

<text>The Métis ( , , , ) are a mixed-race Indigenous people whose historical homelands include Canada&#x27;s three Prairie Provinces extending into parts of Ontario, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and the northwest United States. They have a shared history and culture, deriving from specific mixed European (primarily French, Scottish, and English) and Indigenous ancestry (primarily Cree with strong kinship to Cree people and communities), which became distinct through ethnogenesis by the mid-18th century, during the early years of the North American fur trade.

In Canada, the Métis, with a population of 624,220 as of 2021, are one of three legally recognized Indigenous peoples in the &quot;Constitution Act of 1982&quot;, along with the First Nations and Inuit.

The term &quot;Métis&quot; (uppercase &#x27;M&#x27;) typically refers to the specific community of people defined as the Métis Nation, which originated largely in the Red River Valley and organized politically in the 19th century, radiating outwards from the Red River Settlement (now Winnipeg). Descendants of this community are known as the Red River Métis. In 1870, the Métis Provisional Government of Louis Riel negotiated the entry of the Red River Settlement into Confederation as the Province of Manitoba, making Manitoba the only province to be founded by an Indigenous person.

The Métis National Council (MNC) is the political organization, that represents the Métis Nation at the national and international levels. In 2002, the MNC defined &quot;Métis&quot; as: &quot;a person who self-identifies as Métis, is distinct from other Aboriginal Peoples, is of historic Métis Nation ancestry and who is accepted by the Métis Nation.&quot;
First Nations are disputing this.

Alberta is the only Canadian province with a recognized Métis land base: the eight Métis settlements, with a population of approximately 5,000 people on and the newer Metis lands near Fort McKay, purchased from the Government of Alberta in 2017.

==Background==
===Etymology===
The word itself is originally French for &#x27;person of mixed parentage&#x27; and derives from the Latin word , from , &#x27;mixed&#x27;. It is cognate with the Spanish term .

===Semantic definitions===
The definitions and usage of the terms &quot;Métis&quot;, &quot;Metis&quot;, and &quot;métis&quot; (lowercase) have at times been controversial and contentious; however, there are also legal definitions.

Descendants of English or Scottish and Indigenous were in some cases also historically called &quot;half-breeds&quot; or &quot;country born&quot;. They sometimes adopted a more agrarian culture of subsistence farming and tended to be reared in Protestant denominations.

==== Lowercase &#x27;m&#x27; ====
Starting in the 17th century, the French word was initially used as a noun by those in the North American fur trade, and by settlers in general, to refer to people of mixed European and North-American Indigenous parentage in New France (which at that time extended from the Maritime provinces through southern Quebec and the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, thence southward to Mississippi and Alabama). At the time, it applied generally to French-speaking people who were of partial Indigenous and partial ethnic French descent. It also came to be used for people of mixed European and Indigenous backgrounds in other French colonies, generally the children of unions between French men and non-French women from the colonized areas, including Guadeloupe in the Caribbean; Senegal in West Africa; Algeria in North Africa; and the former French Indochina in Southeast Asia.

The first documented &quot;&quot; child was a girl born about 1628 near Lake Nipissing, given the first name Marguerite, who was the daughter of a Nipissing Indian woman and Jean Nicollet de Belleborne (born about 1598, likely in Cherbourg, France).

Today, the spelling &quot;métis&quot; with a lowercase &#x27;m&#x27; typically functions as an adjective. The definition of the word has at times been disputed, as some people have attempted to use lower-case &quot;métis&quot; in the archaic sense of having a single, distant Indigenous ancestor or being in some other way &quot;mixed&quot;.

==== Uppercase &#x27;M&#x27; ====
As French Canadians followed the North American fur trade to the west, some of the settlers made unions with different Indigenous women, including the Cree. Over time, the Métis (uppercase &#x27;M&#x27;) emerged as a distinct Indigenous people during the late 18th century, with the term referring to a particular sociocultural heritage and an ethnic identification.

In this regard, the term &quot;Métis&quot; is more than a racial classification and refers to the Métis Nation, an Indigenous peoples in Canada and the United States who originated largely in the Red River Valley and organized politically in the 19th century, developing and dispersing outwards from the Red River Settlement (now Winnipeg). Descendants of this community are therefore also often known as the Red River Métis.

Numerous spellings of &quot;Métis&quot; have been used interchangeably, including &quot;métif&quot;, &quot;michif&quot;; currently the most agreed-upon spelling is &quot;Métis&quot;; however, some prefer to use &quot;Metis&quot; as inclusive of persons of both English and French descent.

The majority of Indigenous groups and legal scholars define &quot;Métis&quot; as the people who originate from the historic homeland of the Métis Nation, which encompasses the Prairie Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta and extends into contiguous parts of Ontario, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories, and the northern United States.

The Métis National Council, in 2002, defined &quot;Métis&quot; as: &quot;a person who self-identifies as Métis, is distinct from other Aboriginal Peoples, is of historic Métis Nation ancestry and who is accepted by the Métis Nation.&quot;

Canadian Geographic&#x27;s &quot;Indigenous Peoples Atlas of Canada&quot; identifies Métis people as one of three Canadian Indigenous peoples in the following terms:Within non-Indigenous society, there are two competing ideas of what being Métis means. The first, when spelled with a lowercase &quot;m&quot; (métis), means individuals or people having mixed-race parents and ancestries, e.g., North American Indigenous and European/Euro-Canadian/Euro-American. It is a racial categorization. This is the oldest meaning of métis and is based on the French verb métisser [sic], to mix races or ethnicities. The related noun for the act of race-mixing is métissage. The second meaning of being Métis, and the one that is embraced by the Métis Nation, relates to a self-defining people with a distinct history in a specific region (Western Canada&#x27;s prairies) with some spillover into British Columbia, Ontario, North Dakota, Montana and Northwest Territories. In this case, the term Métis is spelled with an uppercase &quot;M&quot; and often, but does not always, contain an accent aigu (é).

The Métis of Canada and the Métis of the United States adopted parts of their Indigenous and European cultures while forming customs and traditions of their own, as well as developing a common language. Some argue that the ethnogenesis of the Métis began when the Métis organized politically at the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816, while others argue that the ethnogenesis began prior to this battle, before fur traders emigrated from the Great Lakes region to the Western plains.

===Other groups and individuals===
Scholars, Métis people, and First Nations elders and community leaders state that only the descendants of the Red River Métis should be constitutionally recognized as Métis people, as they developed a distinct culture as a people historically, and have continued to exist as a distinct culture and community over many generations.

Objections to this stance have been made to the Métis National Council by both individuals and newly formed groups who do not meet the established citizenship criteria. These individuals and unrecognized groups have recently emerged largely in the Maritime, Quebec, and Ontario regions, and are generally referred to as &quot;Eastern Metis&quot;. Those objecting usually state that having a single, distant, Indigenous or possibly Indigenous ancestor should be enough to be considered Métis. They also disagree that they should have to meet the resident requirement as defined by the federally recognized Métis organizations.
David Chartrand, president of the Manitoba Métis Federation, responding in 2020, said he does not believe these new, self-identified individuals and communities are Métis:
In a 2016 decision, &quot;Daniels v Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development)&quot;, the Supreme Court of Canada stated in par. 17:
Indigenous elders from the Miꞌkmaq and other First Nations communities in the Eastern part of Canada, along with recognized Métis leaders, do not agree with this perspective. They say that there is no distinct Metis community or culture in the Maritimes or Quebec, and that these newly formed, &quot;Eastern Metis&quot; groups are not legitimate:
People of mixed blood in the region either integrated into Indigenous communities or assimilated with European newcomers, unlike the distinct Metis People of Louis Riel in Western Canada.
&quot;When you&#x27;re looking at the Maritimes and Quebec, the children of intermarriage were accepted by either party, in our case the Mi&#x27;kmaq or the Acadian,&quot; Mi&#x27;kmaw elder and historian Daniel Paul says. &quot;There was no such thing as a Metis community here in this region.&quot;

==Métis people in Canada==

Métis people in Canada are specific cultural communities who trace their descent to First Nations and European settlers, primarily the French, in the early decades of the colonization of Canada. Métis peoples are recognized as one of Canada&#x27;s Indigenous peoples under the &quot;Constitution Act&quot; of 1982, along with First Nations and Inuit. On April 8, 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada &quot;Daniels v Canada&quot; appeal held that &quot;Métis and non status Indians are &#x27;Indians&#x27; under s. 91(24),&quot; but excluded the Powley test as the only criterion to determine Metis identity.

Canadian Métis represent the majority of people who identify as Métis, although there are a number of Métis in the United States. In Canada, the population is 587,545 with 20.5 percent living in Ontario and 19.5 percent in Alberta. The Acadians of eastern Canada, some of whom have mixed French and Indigenous origins, are not Métis according to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada and other historic Indigenous communities. This viewpoint sees Métis as historically the children of French fur traders and Nehiyaw women of western and west central Canada.

While the Métis initially developed as the mixed-race descendants of early unions between First Nations and colonial-era European settlers (usually Indigenous women and male French settlers), within generations (particularly in central and western Canada), a distinct Métis culture developed. The women in the unions in eastern Canada were usually Algonquin and Ojibwe, and in western Canada they were Saulteaux, Cree, Ojibwe, Nakoda, and Dakota/Lakota or of mixed descent from these peoples. Their unions with European men engaged in the fur trade in the Old Northwest were often of the type known as marriage &quot;à la façon du pays&quot; (&quot;according to the custom of the country&quot;).

After New France was ceded to Great Britain&#x27;s control in 1763, there was an important distinction between &quot;French Métis&quot; born of francophone &quot;voyageur&quot; fathers and the &quot;Anglo-Métis&quot; (known as &quot;country born&quot; or Mixed Bloods, for instance in the 1870 census of Manitoba) descended from English or Scottish fathers. Today these two cultures have essentially coalesced into location-specific Métis traditions. This does not preclude a range of other Métis cultural expressions across North America. Such polyethnic people were historically referred to by other terms, many of which are now considered to be offensive, such as Mixed-bloods, Half-breeds, Bois-Brûlés, Bungi, Black Scots and Jackatars, the latter term having meaning in a Newfoundland context.

While people of Métis culture or heritage are found across Canada, the traditional Métis &quot;homeland&quot; (areas where Métis populations and culture developed as a distinct ethnicity historically) includes much of the present-day Canadian Prairies along with parts of Northwestern Ontario, British Columbia, and the Northwest-Nunavut Territory. The most well-known group are the &quot;Red River Métis&quot;, centering on southern and central parts of Manitoba along the Red River of the North.

Closely related are the Métis in the United States, primarily those in border areas such as Northern Michigan, the Red River Valley and Eastern Montana. These were areas in which there was considerable Aboriginal and European mixing due to the 19th-century fur trade. However, they do not have a federally recognized status in the United States, except as enrolled members of federally recognized tribes. Although Métis existed farther west than today&#x27;s Manitoba, much less is known about the Métis of Northern Canada.

===Identity===

====Self-identity and legal status====
In 2016, 587,545 people in Canada self-identified as Métis. They represented 35.1% of the total Aboriginal population and 1.5% of the total Canadian population. Most Métis people today are descendants of unions between generations of Métis individuals and live in urban areas. The exception are the Métis in rural and northern parts that exist in close proximity to First Nations communities.

Over the past century, countless Métis have assimilated into the general European Canadian populations. Métis heritage (and thereby Aboriginal ancestry) is more common than is generally realized. People with more distant ancestry, who assimilated into non-Métis society, are not part of the Métis ethnicity or culture.
Unlike among First Nations peoples, laws concerning the Métis make no distinction between Treaty status and non-Treaty status. The Métis did not sign treaties with Canada, with the exception of an adhesion to Treaty 3 in Northwest Ontario. This adherence was never implemented by the federal government. The legal definition is not yet fully developed. Section Thirty-five of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; recognizes the rights of Indian, Métis and Inuit; however, that text does not define these groups. In 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada defined a Métis person as someone who self-identifies as Métis, has an ancestral connection to the historic Métis community, and is accepted by the modern community with continuity to the historic Métis community.

====View of identity====
The most well-known and historically documented mixed-ancestry population in Canadian history are the groups who developed during the fur trade in south-eastern Rupert&#x27;s Land, primarily in the Red River Settlement (now Manitoba) and the Southbranch Settlements (Saskatchewan). In the late 19th century, they organized politically (led by men who had European educations) and had confrontations with the Canadian government in an effort to assert their independence.

This was not the only place where some degree of intermixing (&quot;métisser)&quot; between European and Indigenous people occurred. It was part of the history of colonization from the earliest days of settlements on the Atlantic Coast throughout the Americas. But the strong sense of ethnic national identity among the mostly French- and Michif-speaking Métis along the Red River, demonstrated during armed resistance movements led by Louis Riel, resulted in a specific use of the term &quot;Métis&quot; throughout Canada.

Continued organizing and political activity resulted in &quot;the Métis&quot; gaining official recognition from the national government as one of the recognized Aboriginal groups in S.35 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, which states:

Section 35(2) does not define criteria for an individual who is Métis. This has left open the question of whether &quot;Métis&quot; in this context should apply only to the descendants of the Red River Métis or to all mixed-ancestry groups and individuals. Many members of First Nations may have mixed ancestry but identify primarily by the tribal nation, rather than as Métis.

====Lack of a legal definition====

In contrast to the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, which creates an Indian Register for all (Status) First Nations people, settler-colonial definitions of Métis, Metis and metis have at times been at odds with the definitions of the communities themselves. Some commentators have argued that one of the rights of an Indigenous people is to define their own identity, precluding the need for a government-sanctioned definition.

Alberta is the only province to have defined the term in law under the &quot;Métis Settlements Act&quot; (MSA), which defines a Métis as &quot;a person of Aboriginal ancestry who identifies with Métis history and culture&quot;. This was done in the context of creating a test for legal eligibility for membership in one of Alberta&#x27;s eight Métis settlements. The MSA, together with requirements at the community level (Elder &amp; community acceptance) create the legal requirements for residency on the Métis Settlements. In Alberta law, belonging to a &quot;Métis Association&quot; (Métis National Council or any of its affiliates, Métis Federation of Canada, Congress of Aboriginal People) does not grant one the rights granted to members of the Alberta Métis Settlements. The MSA test excludes those people who are Status Indians (that is, a member of a First Nation), an exclusion which was upheld by the Supreme Court in &quot;Alberta v. Cunningham&quot; (2011).

The number of people self-identifying as Métis has risen sharply since the late 20th century: between 1996 and 2006, the population of Canadians who self-identify as Métis nearly doubled, to approximately 390,000. From 2006 to 2016, according to census results from Statistics Canada, those numbers rose by 125% in Nova Scotia, and 150% in Quebec. Also in that time, &quot;Dozens&quot; of new &quot;Metis&quot; organizations appeared, none of whom could demonstrate any ties to continually existing Métis communities.

Until &quot;R v. Powley&quot; (2003), there was no legal definition of Métis other than the legal requirements found in the &quot;Métis Settlements Act&quot; of 1990. The Powley case involved a claim by Steven Powley and his son Rodney, two members of the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario Métis community who were asserting Métis hunting rights. The Supreme Court of Canada outlined three broad factors to identify Métis who have Hunting Rights as Aboriginal peoples:

All three factors must be present for an individual to qualify under the SCC legal definition of Métis. In addition, the court stated that
Questions remain as to whether Métis have treaty rights; this is an explosive issue in the Canadian Aboriginal community today. It has been stated that &quot;only First Nations could legitimately sign treaties with the government so, by definition, Métis have no Treaty rights.&quot; One treaty names Métis in the title: the Halfbreed (Métis in the French version) Adhesion to Treaty 3. Another, the Robinson Superior Treaty of 1850, listed 84 persons classified as &quot;half-breeds&quot; in the Treaty, so included them and their descendants. Hundreds, if not thousands, of Métis were initially included in a number of other treaties, and then excluded under later amendments to the &quot;Indian Act&quot;.

====Definitions used by Métis representative organizations====
Two main advocacy groups claim to speak for the Métis in Canada: the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples (CAP) and the Métis National Council (MNC). Each uses different approaches to define Métis individuals. The CAP, which has nine regional affiliates, represents all Indigenous peoples in Canada who are living off-reserve, including Métis and non-Status Indians. It does not provide a definition of &quot;Métis&quot;, but instead leaves each affiliate determine its own membership criteria.

Due to the exclusion of a Métis representative among the Native Council of Canada&#x27;s two seats at the Constitutional Conference in 1983, the Manitoba Métis Federation (MMF), the Association of Métis and Non-Status Indians of Saskatchewan (AMNSIS) and the Métis Association of Alberta (MAA) withdrew from the NCC (CAP&#x27;s predecessor) and formed the Métis National Council. Its political leadership of the time stated that the NCC&#x27;s &quot;pan-Aboriginal approach to issues did not allow the Métis Nation to effectively represent itself&quot;. The MNC views the Métis as a single nation with a common history and culture centred on the fur trade of &quot;west-central North America&quot; in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This position has been subject to much debate and controversy.

In 2003, MNC had five provincial affiliates:

* Métis Nation of Ontario
* Manitoba Métis Federation
* Métis Nation—Saskatchewan
* Métis Nation of Alberta (formerly the Métis Association of Alberta)
* Métis Nation of British Columbia

The MNA adopted the following &quot;Definition of Métis&quot;:
Several local, independent Métis organizations have been founded in Canada. In Northern Canada neither the CAP nor the MNC have affiliates; here local Métis organizations deal directly with the federal government and are part of the Aboriginal land claims process. Three of the comprehensive settlements (modern treaties) in force in the Northwest Territories include benefits for Métis people who can prove local Aboriginal ancestry prior to 1921 (Treaty 11).

The federal government recognizes the Métis National Council as the representative Métis group. In December 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made a commitment to the leaders of the Assembly of First Nations, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, and the Métis National Council to have annual meetings. He also committed to two other initiatives aimed at heeding the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) which examined abuses at Indian Residential Schools.

Indigenous Affairs Canada, the relevant federal ministry, deals with the MNC. On April 13, 2017, the two parties signed the Canada-Métis Nation Accord, with the goal of working with the Métis Nation, as represented by the Métis National Council, on a Nation to Nation basis.

In response to the Powley decision, Métis organizations are issuing Métis Nation citizenship cards to their members. Several organizations are registered with the Canadian government to provide Métis cards. The criteria to receive a card and the rights associated with the card vary with each organization. For example, for membership in the MNA, an applicant must provide a documented genealogy and family tree dating to the mid-1800s, proving descent from one or more members of historic Métis groups.

====Cultural definitions====
Cultural definitions of Métis identity inform legal and political ones.

The 1996 Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples stated:
Traditional markers of Métis culture include use of Aboriginal-European languages, such as Michif (French-Cree-Dene) and Bungi (Cree-Ojibwa-English); distinctive clothing, such as the arrowed sash (ceinture flêchée); a rich repertoire of fiddle music, jigs and square dances, and practising a traditional economy based on hunting, trapping, and gathering. However, these cultural markers do not exclude Métis that do not partake in them.

===Canadian history===
During the height of the North American fur trade in New France from 1650 onward, many French and British fur traders married First Nations and Inuit women, mainly Cree, Ojibwa or Saulteaux located in the Great Lakes area and later into the north west. The majority of these fur traders were French and Scottish; the French majority were Catholic. These marriages are commonly referred to as marriage à la façon du pays or marriage according to the &quot;custom of the country.&quot; 

At first, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company officially forbade these relationships. However, many Indigenous peoples actively encouraged them, because they drew fur traders into Indigenous kinship circles, creating social ties that supported the economic relationships developing between them and Europeans. When Indigenous women married European men, they introduced them to their people and their culture, taught them about the land and its resources, and worked alongside them. Indigenous women paddled and steered canoes, made moccasins out of moose skin, netted webbing for snowshoes, skinned animals and dried their meat for pemmican, split and dried fish, snared rabbits and partridges, and helped to manufacture birchbark canoes. Intermarriage made the fur trade more successful.

The children of these marriages were often introduced to Catholicism, but grew up in primarily First Nations societies. They were thought of as the familial bond between the Europeans and First Nations and Inuit of North America. As adults, the men often worked as fur-trade company interpreters, as well as fur trappers in their turn. Many of the first generations of Métis lived within the First Nations societies of their wives and children, but also started to marry Métis women.

By the early 19th century, marriage between European fur traders and First Nations or Inuit women started to decline as European fur traders began to marry Métis women instead, because Métis women were familiar with both white and Indigenous cultures, and could interpret.

According to historian Jacob A. Schooley, the Métis developed over at least two generations and within different economic classes. In the first stage, &quot;servant&quot; (employee) traders of the fur trade companies, known as wintering partners, would stay for the season with First Nations bands, and make a &quot;country marriage&quot; with a high-status native woman. This woman and her children would move to live in the vicinity of a trading fort or post, becoming &quot;House Indians&quot; (as they were called by the company men). House Indians eventually formed distinct bands. Children raised within these &quot;House Indian&quot; bands often became employees of the companies. (Foster cites the York boat captain Paulet Paul as an example). Eventually this second-generation group ended employment with the company and became commonly known as &quot;freemen&quot; traders and trappers. They lived with their families raising children in a distinct culture, accustomed to the fur-trade life, that valued free trading and the buffalo hunt in particular. He considered that the third generation, who were sometimes Métis on both sides, were the first true Métis. He suggests that in the Red River region, many &quot;House Indians&quot; (and some non-&quot;House&quot; First Nations) were assimilated into Métis culture due to the Catholic church&#x27;s strong presence in that region. In the Fort Edmonton region, however, many House Indians never adopted a Métis identity but continued to identify primarily as Cree, Saulteaux, Ojibwa, and Chipweyan descendants up until the early 20th century.
The Métis played a vital role in the success of the western fur trade. They were skilled hunters and trappers, and were raised to appreciate both Aboriginal and European cultures. Métis understanding of both societies and customs helped bridge cultural gaps, resulting in better trading relationships. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company discouraged unions between their fur traders and First Nations and Inuit women, while the North West Company (the English-speaking Quebec-based fur trading company) supported such marriages. Trappers often married First Nations women too, and operated outside company structures. The Métis peoples were respected as valuable employees of both fur trade companies, due to their skills as voyageurs, bison hunters, and interpreters, and for their knowledge of the lands.

By the early 19th century, European immigrants, mainly Scottish farmers, along with Métis families from the Great Lakes region moved to the Red River Valley in present-day Manitoba. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which now administered a monopoly over the territory then called Rupert&#x27;s Land, assigned plots of land to European settlers. The allocation of Red River land caused conflict with those already living in the area, as well as with the North West Company, whose trade routes had been cut in half. Many Métis were working as fur traders with both the North West Company and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Others were working as free traders, or buffalo hunters supplying pemmican to the fur trade. The buffalo were declining in number, and the Métis and First Nations had to go farther and further west to hunt them. Profits from the fur trade were declining because of a reduction in European demand due to changing tastes, as well as the need for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to extend its reach farther from its main posts to get furs.

Most references to the Métis in the 19th century applied to the Plains Métis, but more particularly the Red River Métis. But, the Plains Métis tended to identify by occupational categories: buffalo hunters, pemmican and fur traders, and &quot;tripmen&quot; in the York boat fur brigades among the men; the moccasin sewers and cooks among the women. The largest community in the Assiniboine-Red River district had a different lifestyle and culture from those Métis located in the Saskatchewan, Alberta, Athabasca, and Peace river valleys to the west.

In 1869, two years after Canadian Confederacy, the Government of Canada exerted its power over the people living in Rupert&#x27;s Land after it acquired the land in the mid-19th century from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The Métis and the Anglo-Métis (commonly known as &quot;Countryborn&quot;, children of First Nations women and Orcadian, other Scottish or English men), joined forces to stand up for their rights. They wanted to protect their traditional ways of life against an aggressive and distant Anglo-Canadian government and its local colonizing agents. An 1870 census of Manitoba classified the population as follows: 11,963 total people. Of this number 558 were defined as Indians (First Nations). There were 5,757 Métis and 4,083 English-speaking Mixed Bloods. The remaining 1,565 people were of predominately European, Canadian or American background.

During this time the Canadian government signed treaties (known as the &quot;Numbered Treaties&quot;) with various First Nations. These Nations ceded property rights to almost the entire western plains to the Government of Canada. In return for their ceding traditional lands, the Canadian government promised food, education, medical help, etc. While the Métis generally did not sign any treaty as a group, they were sometimes included, even listed as &quot;half-breeds&quot; in some records.

In the late 19th century, following the &quot;British North America Act&quot; (1867), Louis Riel, a Métis who was formally educated, became a leader of the Métis in the Red River area. He denounced the Canadian government surveys on Métis lands in a speech delivered in late August 1869 in front of Saint Boniface Cathedral. The Métis became more fearful when the Canadian government appointed the notoriously anti-French William McDougall as the Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest Territories on September 28, 1869, in anticipation of a formal transfer of lands to take effect in December.} On November 2, 1869, Louis Riel and 120 men seized Upper Fort Garry, the administrative headquarters of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. This was the first overt act of Métis resistance. On March 4, 1870, the Provisional Government, led by Louis Riel, executed Thomas Scott after Scott was convicted of insubordination and treason. The elected Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia subsequently sent three delegates to Ottawa to negotiate with the Canadian government. This resulted in the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; and that province&#x27;s entry into the Canadian Confederation. Due to the execution of Scott, Riel was charged with murder and fled to the United States in exile.
In March 1885, the Métis heard that a contingent of 500 North-West Mounted Police was heading west. They organized and formed the Provisional Government of Saskatchewan, with Pierre Parenteau as president and Gabriel Dumont as adjutant-general. Riel took charge of a few hundred armed men. They suffered defeat by Canadian armed forces in a conflict known as the North-West Resistance, which occurred in northern Saskatchewan from March 26 to May 12, 1885. Gabriel Dumont fled to the United States, while Riel, Poundmaker, and Big Bear surrendered. Big Bear and Poundmaker each were convicted and received a three-year sentence. On July 6, 1885, Riel was convicted of high treason and was sentenced to hang. Riel appealed but he was executed on November 16, 1885.

===Culture===
====Language====

A majority of the Métis once spoke, and many still speak, either Métis French or an Indigenous language such as Cree, Anishinaabemowin, Denésoliné, etc. A few in some regions spoke a mixed language called Michif which is composed of Plains Cree verbs and French nouns. &quot;Michif&quot;, &quot;Mechif&quot; or &quot;Métchif&quot; is a phonetic spelling of the Métis pronunciation of &quot;Métif&quot;, a variant of &quot;Métis&quot;. The Métis today predominantly speak Canadian English, with Canadian French a strong second language, as well as numerous Aboriginal tongues.

Michif is most used in the United States, notably in the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation of North Dakota. There Michif is the official language of the Métis who reside on this Ojibwe (Chippewa) reservation. After years of decline in use of these languages, the provincial Métis councils are encouraging their revival, use in communities and teaching in schools. The encouragement and use of Métis French and Michif is growing due to outreach after at least a generation of decline.

The 19th-century community of Anglo-Métis, more commonly known as &quot;Countryborn&quot;, were children of people in the Rupert&#x27;s Land fur trade; they were typically of Orcadian, other Scottish, or English paternal descent and Aboriginal maternal descent. Their first languages would have been Aboriginal (Cree language, Saulteaux language, Assiniboine language, etc.) and English. The Gaelic and Scots spoken by Orcadians and other Scots became part of the creole language referred to as &quot;Bungee&quot;.

====Flag====
The Métis flag is one of the oldest patriotic flags originating in Canada. The Métis have two flags. Both flags use the same design of a central infinity symbol, but are different colours. The first red flag was flown by Cuthbert Grant in 1815 near Fort Espérance alongside the North-West Company (an unsubstantiated rumour reported by James Sutherland claimed that it was a gift from the North-West Company, but no evidence corroborates this). Days before the Battle of Seven Oaks, &quot;La Grenouillère&quot; in 1816, Peter Fidler recorded Cuthbert Grant flying the blue flag. The red and blue are not cultural or linguistic identifiers and do not represent the companies.

====Cultural genocide====
In 2019, the final report, &quot;Reclaiming Power and Place&quot;, by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls stated &quot;The violence the National Inquiry heard amounts to a race-based genocide of Indigenous Peoples, including First Nations, Inuit and Métis, which especially targets women and girls.&quot;

===Land ownership===
Issues of land ownership became a central theme, as the Métis sold most of the 600,000 acres (2430 km2) they received in the first settlement.

During the 1930s, political activism arose in Métis communities in Alberta and Saskatchewan over land rights, and some filed land claims for the return of certain lands.
Five men, sometimes dubbed &quot;The Famous Five&quot;, (James P. Brady, Malcolm Norris, Peter Tomkins Jr., Joe Dion, Felix Callihoo) were instrumental in having the Alberta government form the 1934 &quot;Ewing Commission&quot;, headed by Albert Ewing, to deal with land claims The Alberta government passed the &quot;Métis Population Betterment Act&quot; in 1938. The Act provided funding and land to the Métis. (The provincial government later rescinded portions of the land in certain areas.)

In 1972, the Red River Point Society began leasing land around the community of Fort McKay, Alberta on behalf of the Metis community there. In 2017, the Fort McKay local of the Metis Nation of Alberta purchased some land outright.

===Distribution===
According to the 2016 Canada Census, a total of 587,545 individuals self-identified as Métis. However, it is doubtful that all such individuals would meet the objective tests laid out in the Supreme Court decisions &quot;Powley&quot; and &quot;Daniels&quot; and therefore qualify as &quot;Métis&quot; for the purposes of Canadian law. Data from this section is from the 2016 Canadian Census by Statistics Canada.

=== Métis settlements of Alberta ===

The Métis settlements in Alberta are the only recognized land base of Métis in Canada. They are represented and governed collectively by a unique Métis government known as the Métis Settlements General Council (MSGC), also known as the &quot;All-Council&quot;. The MSGC is the provincial, national, and international representative of the Federated Métis Settlements. It holds fee simple land title via Letters Patents to 1.25 million acres (5060 km2) of land, making the MSGC the largest land holder in the province, other than the Crown in the Right of Alberta. The MSGC is the only recognized Métis Government in Canada with prescribed land, power, and jurisdiction via the &quot;Métis Settlements Act&quot;. (This legislation followed legal suits filed by the Métis Settlements against the Crown in the 1970s).

The Métis settlements consist of predominantly Indigenous Métis populations native to Northern Alberta – distinct from those of the Red River, the Great Lakes, and other migrant Métis from further east. However, following the Riel and Dumont resistances some Red-River Métis fled westward, where they married into the contemporary Métis settlement populations during the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th century. Historically referred to as the &quot;Nomadic Half-breeds&quot;, the Métis of Northern Alberta have a unique history. Their fight for land is still evident today with the eight contemporary Métis settlements.

Following the formal establishment of the Métis settlements, then called Half-Breed Colonies, in the 1930s by a distinct Métis political organization, the Métis populations in Northern Alberta were the only Métis to secure communal Métis lands. During renewed Indigenous activism during the 1960s into the 1970s, political organizations were formed or revived among the Métis. In Alberta, the Métis settlements united as: The &quot;Alberta Federation of Métis Settlement Associations&quot; in the mid-1970s. Today, the Federation is represented by the Métis Settlements General Council.

During the constitutional talks of 1982, the Métis were recognized as one of the three Aboriginal peoples of Canada, in part by the Federation of Métis Settlements. In 1990, the Alberta government, following years of conferences and negotiations between the Federation of Métis Settlements (FMS) and the Crown in the Right of Alberta, restored land titles to the northern Métis communities through the &quot;Métis Settlement Act&quot;, replacing the &quot;Métis Betterment Act&quot;. Originally, the first Métis settlements in Alberta were called colonies and consisted of:

* Buffalo Lake (Caslan) or Beaver River
* Cold Lake
* East Prairie (south of Lesser Slave Lake)
* Elizabeth (east of Elk Point)
* Fishing Lake (Packechawanis)
* Gift Lake (Ma-cha-cho-wi-se) or Utikuma Lake
* Goodfish Lake
* Kikino
* Kings Land
* Marlboro
* Paddle Prairie (or Keg River)
* Peavine (Big Prairie, north of High Prairie)
* Touchwood
* Wolf Lake (north of Bonnyville)

In the 1960s, the settlements of Marlboro, Touchwood, Cold Lake, and Wolf Lake were dissolved by Order-in-Council by the Alberta Government. The remaining Métis Settlers were forced to move into one of the eight remaining Métis Settlements – leaving the eight contemporary Métis Settlements.

The position of Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians was created in 1985 as a portfolio in the Canadian Cabinet. The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is officially responsible only for Status Indians and largely with those living on Indian reserves. The new position was created in order provide a liaison between the federal government and Métis and non-status Aboriginal peoples, urban Aboriginals, and their representatives.

== Organizations in Canada ==

=== Pre-Batoche ===
The Provisional Government of Saskatchewan was the name given by Louis Riel to the independent state he declared during the North-West Rebellion (Resistance) of 1885 in what is today the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The governing council was named the Exovedate, Latin for &quot;of the flock&quot;. The council debated issues ranging from military policy to local bylaws and theological issues. It met at Batoche, Saskatchewan, and exercised real authority only over the Southbranch Settlement. The provisional government collapsed that year after the Battle of Batoche.

=== Métis Nation of Alberta (1928) ===
In the 1920s, Métis in the Cold Lake area of Alberta were concerned about the federal government&#x27;s decision to transfer control of natural resources to the province and its impact on Métis living on Crown land. The &quot;Métis Famous Five&quot; thereby founded the &quot;Association des Métis Alberta et les Territoires du Nord-Ouest&quot; in 1928 as the first stable Métis organization in Alberta that could advocate to the provincial government there.

In 1932, the Association was organized more formally and became the Métis Association of Alberta (MAA), including 31 locals across Alberta.

Joe Dion, Malcolm Norris, and Adrian Hope, as well as other Métis leaders, successfully lobbied the provincial government, In 1934, the Ewing Commission was formed to investigate Métis issues, which in turn resulted in the &quot;Métis Population Betterment Act&quot; and the creation of the Metis Settlements.

The MAA would later be renamed as the Métis Nation of Alberta (MNA).

In February 2020, the Alberta Métis Federation was founded to represent six local Métis communities in Alberta that had separated from the MNA.

=== Manitoba Métis Federation (1967) ===
The Manitoba Métis Federation (MMF), founded in 1967, is the only officially recognized Métis Government in Canada.

On July 6, 2021, the MMF signed the Manitoba Métis Self-Government Recognition and Implementation Agreement with the Government of Canada at Upper Fort Garry, which provided immediate recognition of the MMF as the democratically elected Métis Government for the Red River Métis.

In September 2021, the MMF withdrew from the Métis National Council, due to that organization&#x27;s failure to uphold the 2002 nationally accepted definition of Métis.

=== Congress of Aboriginal Peoples (1971) ===
The Native Council of Canada was founded in 1971 as a pan-Indigenous umbrella group that included member organizations that represented all off-reserve First Nations as well as the Métis. In 1983, many of its Western Metis members split off to form the Métis National Council. The Native Council of Canada continues today as the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples (CAP) and its nine regional affiliates represent all Aboriginal people who are not part of the reserve system, including Métis and non-Status Indians.

=== Metis National Council (1983) ===
The Métis National Council was formed in 1983, following the recognition of the Métis as &quot;aboriginal peoples of Canada,&quot; in Section Thirty-five of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;. The MNC was a member of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples (WCIP).

In 1997 the Métis National Council was granted NGO Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The MNC&#x27;s first ambassador to this group was Clément Chartier. MNC is a founding member of the American Council of Indigenous Peoples (ACIP).

The Métis National Council is currently composed of four provincial Métis organizations, though numbers have varied over time. namely,

* Métis Nation of Alberta
* Métis Nation British Columbia
* Métis Nation-Saskatchewan
* Métis Nation of Ontario
The National Council holds province-wide ballot box elections for political positions in these associations, held at regular intervals, for regional and provincial leadership. Métis citizens and their communities are represented and participate in these Métis governance structures by way of elected Locals or Community Councils, as well as provincial assemblies held annually.

There used to be five groups, but in September 2021, the Manitoba Metis Federation left over membership issues involving the Métis Nation of Ontario (MNO), with President David Chartrand citing issues of the Council accepting the MNO despite the MNO having &quot;nearly 80 per cent non-Métis Nation Citizens in their registry.&quot; The Métis National Council has stated that they reject the idea of new Ontario Métis communities, and in 2020 they suspended the membership of the MNO due to concerns that 90% of the MNOs registered members did not fulfill the requirements of citizenship put in place by the National Council in 2002, notably the requirement for an ancestral link to the Métis homelands and the Red River area specifically.

&lt;q&gt;On March 22, 2022, in response to Chartrand&#x27;s comments on MNO suspension, President Margaret Froh stated her position that, &quot;The MNO was never suspended, the MNO was on probation and there was a decision by just a few individuals declaring that the MNO was suspended when in fact that wasn&#x27;t correct and in fact we (MNO) went to court and the court concluded we were not suspended.&lt;/q&gt; The Ontario group had granted memberships to people from four disputed communities: Mattawa, Georgian Bay, Killarney, and Temiskaming, claiming these groups consist of Métis people, and not simply regions inhabited by First Nations individuals and some settlers, but without cultural ties to the recognized Métis communities. When the suspension was announced, a motion was passed to create a panel of experts, including representatives from the four Métis Nation governments (including MNO), to &quot;gather information and present findings and recommendations&quot; on how to proceed.

=== Ontario Métis Aboriginal Association ===
The Woodland Métis are not affiliated with the Métis Nation of Ontario (MNO). MNO President Tony Belcourt said in 2005 that he did not know who OMAA members are, but that they are not Métis.

In a Supreme Court of Canada appeal (Document C28533, page 17), the federal government states that &quot;membership in OMAA and/or MNO does not establish membership in the specific local aboriginal community for the purposes of establishing a s. 35 [Indigenous and treaty] right. Neither OMAA nor the MNO constitute the sort of discrete, historic and site-specific community contemplated by Van der Peet capable of holding a constitutionally protected aboriginal right&quot;. (See: Other groups and individuals)

==Métis people in the United States==

Métis people in the United States are a specific culture and community, who descend from unions between Native American and early European colonist parents – usually Indigenous women who married French, and later Scottish or English, men, who worked as fur trappers and traders during the 17th to 19th centuries in the fur trade era. The women were usually Algonquian, Ojibwe and Cree. They developed as an ethnic and cultural group from the descendants of these unions.

In the French colonies, people of mixed Indigenous and French ancestry were referred to by those who spoke French as &quot;métis&quot;, meaning &quot;mixture.&quot; Being bilingual, these people were able to trade European goods, such as muskets, for the furs and hides at a trading post. These &quot;Métis&quot; were found throughout the Great Lakes area and to the west, in the Rocky Mountains. While the word in this usage originally had no ethnic designation (and was not capitalized in English), it grew to describe a specific ethnicity by the early 19th century. This use (of simply meaning &quot;mixed&quot;) excludes mixed-race people born of unions in other settings or more recently than about 1870.

Fewer Métis live in the U.S. than in Canada. During the early colonial era, people moved easily back and forth through Canada and the other British colonies.

===Geography===
With exploration, settlement, and exploitation of resources by French and British fur trading interests across North America, European men often had relationships and sometimes marriages with Native American women. Often both sides felt such marriages were beneficial in strengthening the fur trade. Indigenous women often served as interpreters and could introduce their men to their people. Because many Native Americans and First Nations often had matrilineal kinship systems, the mixed-race children were considered born to the mother&#x27;s clan and usually raised in her culture. Few were educated in European schools.

The métis children who did attempt to integrate into European societies faced many issues with trying to gain citizenship within these early settlements. Their success often related to their European father&#x27;s status; fur traders, rather than trappers, were more settled men of capital and more likely to acquire education for their mixed-race children.

The métis men in the northern tier typically worked in the fur trade and later hunting and as guides. The métis based in Red River Colony eventually settled throughout the Canadian Prairies as a distinct ethnic group with its own culture known as the Métis.

===United States history===
Between 1795 and 1815, a network of Métis settlements and trading posts was established throughout what is now the US states of Michigan and to a lesser extent in Illinois and Indiana.
After the War of 1812, the US prohibited British (including Scots) traders from Canada participating in the fur trade south of the border, disrupting longstanding practices. During the early days of territorial Michigan, Métis and ethnic French played a dominant role in elections, as they had been established there long before the United States was formed. It was largely with Métis support that Gabriel Richard was elected as delegate to Congress.

After Michigan was admitted as a state and, under pressure of increased numbers of European-American settlers from eastern states, many Métis migrated westward into the Canadian Prairies, including the Red River Colony and the Southbranch Settlement. By the late 1830s only in the area of Sault Ste. Marie, which had long been a center of fur trading and more cosmopolitan interracial encounter, was there recognition of the Métis as significant members of the community.

A large group of Métis from the Pembina region hunted in Montana in the 1860s, eventually forming an agricultural settlement in the Judith Basin by 1880. This settlement eventually disintegrated, with most Métis leaving, or identifying more strongly either as &quot;white&quot; or &quot;Indian&quot;.

Métis often participated in interracial marriages. The French, particularly, viewed these marriages as sensible and realistic. Americans, however, viewed interracial marriages as unsound based on their ideas of racial purity. Although marriage to Native Americans was legal, some parts of American society believed that the spouse of the highest social class lost status by such marriage, as did their children. In frontier areas, these ideas were less important.

The French, however, had encouraged fur traders to participate in interracial marriages with Indians as they were beneficial to the fur trade business and also to spread religion. Generally speaking, these marriages were happy ones, that lasted and brought together differing groups of people and benefitted the fur trade business.

===Current population===
Mixed-race people live throughout Canada and the northern United States. Relatively few in the US identify ethnically and culturally as Métis, as it was based north of the border in Red River country. A strong Prairie Métis identity exists in the Métis Homeland which occupied most of Rupert&#x27;s Land.

Métis or their descendants also live in Minnesota, Montana and North Dakota. A number of self-identified Métis live in North Dakota, mostly in Pembina County. Many members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians (a federally recognized Tribe) identify as Métis or Michif rather than as strictly Ojibwe.

Many Métis families are recorded in the U.S. Census for the historic Métis settlement areas along the Detroit and St. Clair rivers, Mackinac Island and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.

Métis persons generally have not organized as an ethnic or political group in the United States as they have in Canada, where they had armed confrontations and have gained status rights as a recognized aboriginal group.

The first &quot;Conference on the Métis in North America&quot; was held in Chicago in 1981, after increasing research about this people. This also was a period of increased appreciation for different ethnic groups and reappraisal of the histories of settlement of North America.

Papers at the conference focused on &quot;becoming Métis&quot;, and the role of history in formation of this ethnic group, defined in Canada as having Aboriginal status. The Metis peoples and their history continue to be extensively studied, especially by scholars in Canada and the United States.

===Louis Riel and the United States===
Riel had a significant influence on the Métis community in Canada, especially in the Manitoba region. However, he also had a distinct relationship with the Métis in the United States who were related to the Canadian base. He had entered the US and was an American citizen when he was captured. He was returned to Canada where he was convicted of treason for earlier actions and executed. Riel attempted to lead those of the Métis community in the United States who were related to the Red River region, and contributed to the defence of Métis rights.

On October 22, 1844, Louis Riel was born in the Red River settlement known as the territory of Assiniboia. He was born with French background; however, as the Métis are a mobile community, he travelled a lot and had a transitional identity, meaning he would often cross the Canada and United States border. During the 19th century, there were few American-born citizens living in Red River.

On November 22, 1869, Riel went to Winnipeg to discuss the rights of the Métis community with Governor McDougall. At the end of the settlement, McDougall agreed to guarantee a &quot;List of Rights&quot;. It also incorporated four clauses of the Dakota bill of rights. This Bill of rights was the rise of the American influence during the Red River Métis resistance and was an important milestone in Métis justice.

The following years were a time of conflict between the government in charge and the Métis people. Métis leaders, such as Louis Riel, were crossing the border without what the colonial government saw as proper notice. This caused repercussions for Riel, who was wanted by the Ontario government. He was later accused of the Scott Death, a murder case. By 1874, there was a warrant out for his arrest in Winnipeg. Because of the warrant charges in Canada, Riel believed that the United States was a safer territory for him and the Métis people. He went into exile in the US.

Riel struggled with mental health problems and sought proper treatment in the American northeast from 1875 to 1878. Once better, he decided to obtain an American residence and complete the liberation of the Métis people that he first started in 1869. Riel wanted to gain US military support to invade Manitoba to obtain control. The American military rejected his proposition.

He tried to create an international alliance between the Aboriginal and Metis peoples, but was not successful. In the end he worked to improve the living conditions and rights of the Métis people in the United States. Frustrated by his failures, Riel suffered further mental breakdowns and was hospitalized in Quebec.

From 1879, Riel returned to Montana to work on leading the Métis and Native peoples of the region to join forces and work against the provisional government. He did not succeed, but he decided to become an American citizen. He said, &quot;The United States sheltered me, The English didn&#x27;t care/what they owe they will pay/! I am citizen&quot;. He spent the next four years working to improve the conditions of the Montana Métis.

From 1880 to 1884, Riel concentrated his public life on improving the situation of the Montana Metis. In the following years, he tried to gain official United States citizenship. Although he did, it did not protect him from being convicted of treason in Canada for earlier actions and being executed.

==Medicine Line (Canada–U.S. border)==
The Métis homeland existed before the implementation of the Canada–U.S. border and continues to exist on both sides of this border today. The implementation of the border affected the Métis in a multitude of ways, with border enforcement growing from relaxed to increasingly stronger over time. In the late 18th century, to early 19th century the Métis found that in times of conflict, they could cross the 49th parallel north in either direction and the trouble following them would stop and so the border was known as the Medicine Line. This began to change toward the end of the 19th century when the border became more enforced and the Canadian government saw an opportunity to put an end to the line hopping by using military force. This effectively split some of the Métis population and restricted the mobility of the People. The enforcement of the border was used as a means for governments on either side of the Medicine Line in the grand prairies to control the Métis population and to restrict their access to buffalo. Because of the importance of kinship and mobility for Métis communities, this had negative implications and resulted in different experiences and hardships for people in the now divided group.

Métis experience in the U.S. is largely coloured by unratified treaties and the lack of federal representation of Métis communities as a legitimate people, and this can be seen in the case of the Little Shell Tribe in Montana. While experiences in Canada are also affected by the misrecognition of the Métis, many Métis were dispossessed of their lands when they were sold to settlers and some communities set up road allowance villages. These small villages were squatters&#x27; villages along Crown land outside established villages in the prairies of Canada. These villages were often burned by local authorities and had to be rebuilt by surviving members of the communities who lived in them.

<text>The Mount Sinai School District is a United States educational division of the Mount Sinai, New York community in the Town of Brookhaven on the north shore of Long Island. Established in 1870, the district oversees three schools that serve approximately 2,200 students located in a six square mile area. The Board of Education for the district consists of seven members, including a president and a vice-president. The 2020-2021 budget was about $61,000,000. The location of the original school building is unknown; however, tradition places it on North Country Road east of Mt Sinai Coram Road. The second one-room school was built in 1870 on a half acre of land on the southeast corner of North Country and Mt Sinai Coram Road and in 1908 a second classroom was added. This building served the community until 1960. At that time the community decided to send their children to be educated in Port Jefferson School District. In 1960, the school was moved and a firehouse was built on the original property.

==Schools==

===Mount Sinai Elementary School===
Opened in 1966, serving grades kindergarten through 4th grade. The current principal is Rob Catlin. The elementary assistant principal is Brian McCarthy.

===Mount Sinai Middle School===
Opened in 1978, serving grades 5th through 8th. The current principal is Mr. Christopher Elsesser and the assistant principal is Mr. Matthew Dyroff.

===Robert M. Grable Mount Sinai High School===
Formerly opened as Mount Sinai High School in 1991 for 9th through 12th grades. The principal through the 2018–2019 school year was Robert Grable until his passing on July 19, 2019. On July 22, 2019, at the vigil for the late Robert Grable, it was announced the school was to be renamed the Robert M. Grable Memorial High School, pending a Board of Education vote on August 28, 2019. The Board of Education subsequently approved renaming the school to Robert M. Grable Mount Sinai High School. The assistant principals are Christina Romeo and Meghan Tepfenhardt. On August 23, 2019, Superintendent Gordon Brosdal announced that former Middle School principal, Peter Pramataris, will take the role as interim high school principal. The current high school administration includes Peter Pramataris as high school principal, and Christina Romeo as assistant principal.

==Student Activities==

Mt. Sinai School District features many clubs, both nationally recognized and independent, as well as sports. Students in all three schools have the opportunity to join these clubs, and students in the Middle and High schools can try out for the sports teams.

<text>Rudolf &quot;Rudi&quot; Fischer (19 April 1912 – 30 December 1976) was a Swiss racing driver, who competed in Formula One at seven Grands Prix from to .

Fischer debuted in Formula One at the in . He achieved two podium finishes, and scored a total of 10 championship points. He also participated in numerous non-championship Formula One and Formula Two races.

==Career==
Fischer finished third in a race which marked the reopening of the AVUS, a German motor racing circuit. It had been closed for a 14-year period and was damaged during World War II. A crowd of 350,000 watched Paul Greifzu of Suhl, Thuringia, win in a car he built himself. Fischer drove a Ferrari to third place over a distance of 207.5 kilometres. His time was 1 hour, 10 minutes, 27.5 seconds. In the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, in Bern, Fischer finished second to Piero Taruffi; both drivers were in Ferraris.

==Écurie Espadon/Scuderia Espadon==
Fischer was the leader of the &quot;Écurie Espadon&quot;, the entrant name for most of his racing career.

Écurie Espadon was composed of a group of Swiss amateur gentleman racers. The word &quot;Écurie&quot; was used at the beginning as most of the team&#x27;s cars were French, generally Gordinis. Later the team&#x27;s equipment changed to Ferraris and other Italian vehicles, thus the name of the team changed to use the equivalent Italian word &quot;Scuderia&quot;.

The team was involved in several races all over Europe, as the presentation document described.

The team was composed of:
* Rudolf Fischer: a successful restaurant owner.
* Rudolf Schoeller
* Peter Hirt: a wealthy businessman from Küssnacht, near Zürich, involved in precision tool manufacturing.
* Peter (Pierre) Staechelin from Basel.
* Max de Terra
* Paul Glauser

<doc id="1236063" wikidata="Q172098" url="?curid=1236063" title="Tony Bettenhausen">
<text>Melvin Eugene &quot;Tony&quot; Bettenhausen (September 12, 1916 – May 12, 1961) was an American racing driver known primarily for his open-wheel career. He twice won the National Championship, doing so in 1951 and 1958. He also competed in stock cars, winning under AAA and USAC sanction.

Bettenhausen was nicknamed the &quot;Tinley Park Express&quot; in honor of his hometown. He was nicknamed &quot;Tunney&quot; after heavyweight boxing champion Gene Tunney. &quot;Tunney&quot; later became &quot;Tony.&quot;

== Racing career ==

=== Midget car career ===

Bettenhausen was part of the midget car &quot;Chicago Gang&quot; with Emil Andres, Cowboy O&#x27;Rourke, Paul Russo, Jimmy Snyder, and Wally Zale. These racers toured tracks in the Midwest and East Coast of the United States.

Bettenhausen won the track championship at the Milwaukee Mile in 1942, 1946, and 1947. He was the Chicago Raceway Park champion in 1941, 1942, and 1947.

In October 1950, he was involved in a race in Sacramento, California, when his car locked wheels with another racer&#x27;s car, causing a crash through the guard rail, resulting in fatal injuries to spectator Peter Bernard Stuberak, and injuries to two other spectators.

Bettenhausen won the 1959 Turkey Night Grand Prix, and the Hut Hundred in 1955 and 1956.

=== Championship car career ===

Bettenhausen drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1941 and 1946-1961 seasons with 121 starts, including 14 in the Indianapolis 500. He finished in the top ten 74 times, with 21 victories.

He won the National Championship in 1951 after recording eight victories and two second-place finishes in fourteen events. He announced his retirement from all racing but the Indianapolis 500 after the season.
He decided to return full-time for the 1954 season. He was involved in a midget car wreck in Chicago, suffering head injuries after striking a concrete wall. He was in critical condition for several days.

He prearranged to co-drive with Chicago Gang friend Paul Russo in the 1955 Indianapolis 500. They finished second.

In 1958, Bettenhausen became the first driver to claim the National Championship without a win. He was assured the title with a second-place finish at Phoenix. He finished second in the national championship to Rodger Ward in 1959.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Bettenhausen was killed in a May 12, 1961 crash at Indianapolis while testing a Stearly Motor Freight Special vehicle for Paul Russo. The car smashed into the outside wall of the track and then rolled along the barrier. The car came to rest in a grassy plot between the wall and Grandstand A, with the tail of the car on fire. Results showed the accident was caused by an anchor bolt which fell off the front radius rod support, allowing the front axle to twist and misalign the front wheels when the brakes were applied, which drove the car into the wall. Bettenhausen died instantly.

<text>The Korean Social Democratic Party (KSDP) is a political party in North Korea that is allied with the ruling Workers&#x27; Party of Korea (WPK). It was formed on 3 November 1945 as the Korean Democratic Party by a mixed group of entrepreneurs, merchants, handicraftsmen, petite bourgeoisie, peasants, and Christians. The party&#x27;s founders were motivated by anti-imperialist and anti-feudal aspirations, and aimed to eliminate the legacy of Japanese rule and build a new democratic society. The party came under greater influence of the ruling government over time, and today is under the effective control of the WPK.

==History==

The party was established in Pyongyang by Cho Man-sik on 3 November 1945 as the Korean Democratic Party (). It quickly gained support from Christian businessmen and intellectuals, as well as well-off workers, and had around half a million members after only a few weeks, while reports by the Soviet Union said that the party had 141 thousand members by May 1946. Cho was forced to appoint Choe Yong-gon, a secret communist sympathizer, as his deputy in the party, while the communists increasingly targeted the party for infiltration.

Cho opposed the results of the Moscow Conference in December 1945, in which the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States agreed to establish a joint trusteeship over the formerly Japanese-occupied Korea, which triggered widespread opposition and protests. The KDP Central Committee&#x27;s Plenum on 2 January 1946 formally voted against the trusteeship plan, and on 5 January, Cho resigned from his position as chairman of the Provisional People&#x27;s Committee for the Five Provinces, leading many KDP members to follow his example.

Shortly after his resignation, he was arrested by Soviet authorities. Cho&#x27;s arrest led to many of the party&#x27;s leaders moving to Seoul in South Korea, where they set up a new headquarters; the party nominated five candidates for the May 1948 Constitutional Assembly elections in South Korea, winning one seat, taken by Yi Yun-yong. In North Korea, the party held its first Congress on 24 February 1946, when Choe Yong-gon was formally elected as leader of the party while Cho Man-sik was declared as &quot;a traitor to the nation and a hireling of American and Japanese imperialism&quot;. A purge of Cho&#x27;s alleged or real sympathizers in the party took place afterwards.

The KDP subsequently joined the newly-established North Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front on 22 July, effectively becoming subordinate to the newly-emerging Communist Party of Korea (which later became the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea). The KDP held its Second Congress on 13–15 April 1947, where it continued to attack Cho, praised the &quot;liberating mission of the heroic Soviet Army&quot; and adopted a structure closely resembling that of the Workers&#x27; Party of North Korea.

Despite increasingly coming under the control of the communists, the KDP initially still continued to attract members, with a Soviet document mentioning the party reaching 291,459 members by December 1946, while a resolution of the Second Congress from May 1947 stating that it had 273,665 members. The party was used by the WPK leadership to keep track on and diffuse anti-communists in North Korea.

KDP candidates were given 35 seats in the August 1948 elections, the newly-elected Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly (SPA) later proclaimed the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in September 1948. The party further declined during the Korean War, during when many of its members sided with the government of South Korea and left the North when South Korean and United Nations forces retreated in 1950–1951. By the end of the war, its membership dropped to below 10,000. In February 1956, Choe Yong-gon was appointed as a vice chairman of the WPK, leaving Hong Ki-hwang, deputy chairman of the KDP since late 1945, to replace him as chairman of the KDP.

It was given eleven seats in the 1957 parliamentary elections. Hong and Chondoist Chongu Party leader Kim Tal-hyon were made a ministers without portfolios in September 1957, the last time non-Communist parties were given Cabinet positions. Hong and Kim were purged in 1958 as part of a purge of non-WPK parties, with Hong being accused of espionage and &quot;having contacts with American imperialism&quot;. In 1959 and 1960 all of the party&#x27;s offices were shut down by the government. It was subsequently reduced to four seats in 1962 and one in 1967 and 1972. In 1980 it adopted its current name, the Korean Social Democratic Party (KSDP).

From 1982 until the early 2000s, the party distributed its party journal abroad in Korean and English translation. Since the mid-2000s, its party journal is only available online.

The 1990 elections saw the party awarded 51 seats. It had 52 seats following the 1998 elections and 50 after the 2009 elections. It retained the same number of seats in the 2014 elections.

The party was headed by Pak Yong-il until his death in 2022. The previous chairman was Kim Yong-dae. , the party had more than 30,000 members.

=== Criticism of government policy ===
Contrary to its usual portrayal in official propaganda, for a brief time in the mid-to-late 1980s, the party&#x27;s journal featured texts raising criticism of government policies. These included calls to give more support to people with disabilities or improve the petition system, as well as raising the potential benefits of allowing more than one candidate per election district and allowing voters to decide which would be elected. It is believed these statements may have been linked to a brief liberalization of North Korea&#x27;s justice system that occurred around the same time.

==Ideology==
The Korean Democratic Party was initially founded by Cho Man-sik as a nationalist party that could potentially play a significant role in a coalition with the communists. After Cho&#x27;s arrest, the party transitioned into a satellite party of the communists. During its Second Congress in 1947, the KDP formally incorporated the theory of &quot;people’s democratic revolution&quot; into its program; while not explicitly mentioning socialism, the KDP declared it was unconditionally supportive of the political and social reforms done in North Korea. It also supported friendly ties with the Soviet Union and adopted democratic centralism to its structure.

Since its neutralization and effective demise by the WPK, the party has been used in North Korean propaganda targeting foreign sympathizers. In 1981, the party was renamed to the Korean Social Democratic Party. Because of the ostensible social democratic ideology, which is intelligible to foreigners, the Social Democratic Party is used in such propaganda much more than the other legal minor party, Chondoist Chongu Party. In the 1990s, the KSDP published periodical magazines in Korean and English. These magazines sought to simultaneously convince foreigners that North Korea has a multi-party system with independent parties, but also contradictorily that minor parties in North Korea support the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea without reservation.

== Organization ==
The KSDP was a member of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea from 1949 until the front&#x27;s dissolution in 2024. It participated in the front alongside the other legal political parties and organisations of North Korea.

==International relations==
The Korean Social Democratic Party had formed a sisterhood alliance of the now-defunct South Korea&#x27;s Democratic Labor Party and Unified Progressive Party. The party also is currently interacting with South Korea&#x27;s Progressive Party. The party issued an &quot;anti-Japan joint statement&quot; (반일공동성명) with the South Korea&#x27;s Progressive Party in 2019.

The party also maintained communications with the now-defunct Japan Socialist Party.
