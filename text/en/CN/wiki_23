<text>A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) (also known as &quot;quartz microbalance&quot; (QMB), sometimes also as &quot;quartz crystal nanobalance&quot; (QCN)) measures a mass variation per unit area by measuring the change in frequency of a quartz crystal resonator. The resonance is disturbed by the addition or removal of a small mass due to oxide growth/decay or film deposition at the surface of the acoustic resonator. The QCM can be used under vacuum, in gas phase (&quot;gas sensor&quot;, first use described by King) and more recently in liquid environments. It is useful for monitoring the rate of deposition in thin-film deposition systems under vacuum. In liquid, it is highly effective at determining the affinity of molecules (proteins, in particular) to surfaces functionalized with recognition sites. Larger entities such as viruses or polymers are investigated as well. QCM has also been used to investigate interactions between biomolecules. Frequency measurements are easily made to high precision (discussed below); hence, it is easy to measure mass densities down to a level of below 1 μg/cm2. In addition to measuring the frequency, the dissipation factor (equivalent to the resonance bandwidth) is often measured to help analysis. The dissipation factor is the inverse quality factor of the resonance, Q−1 = w/fr (see below); it quantifies the damping in the system and is related to the sample&#x27;s viscoelastic properties.

== General ==
Quartz is one member of a family of crystals that experience the piezoelectric effect. The piezoelectric effect has found applications in high power sources, sensors, actuators, frequency standards, motors, etc., and the relationship between applied voltage and mechanical deformation is well known; this allows probing an acoustic resonance by electrical means. Applying alternating current to the quartz crystal will induce oscillations. With an alternating current between the electrodes of a properly cut crystal, a standing shear wave is generated. The Q factor, which is the ratio of frequency and bandwidth, can be as high as 106. Such a narrow resonance leads to highly stable oscillators and a high accuracy in the determination of the resonance frequency. The QCM exploits this ease and precision for sensing. Common equipment allows resolution down to 1 Hz on crystals with a fundamental resonant frequency in the 4 – 6 MHz range. A typical setup for the QCM contains water cooling tubes, the retaining unit, frequency sensing equipment through a microdot feed-through, an oscillation source, and a measurement and recording device.

The frequency of oscillation of the quartz crystal is partially dependent on the thickness of the crystal. During normal operation, all the other influencing variables remain constant; thus a change in thickness correlates directly to a change in frequency. As mass is deposited on the surface of the crystal, the thickness increases; consequently the frequency of oscillation decreases from the initial value. With some simplifying assumptions, this frequency change can be quantified and correlated precisely to the mass change using the Sauerbrey equation. Other techniques for measuring the properties of thin films include ellipsometry, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance and dual polarisation interferometry.

== Gravimetric and non-gravimetric QCM ==
The classical sensing application of quartz crystal resonators is microgravimetry. Many commercial instruments, some of which are called thickness monitors, are available. These devices exploit the Sauerbrey relation. For thin films, the resonance frequency is usually inversely proportional to the total thickness of the plate. The latter increases when a film is deposited onto the crystal surface. Monolayer sensitivity is easily reached. However, when the film thickness increases, viscoelastic effects come into play. In the late 1980s, it was recognized that the QCM can also be operated in liquids, if proper measures are taken to overcome the consequences of the large damping. Again, viscoelastic effects contribute strongly to the resonance properties.

Today, microweighing is one of several uses of the QCM.
Measurements of viscosity and more general, viscoelastic properties, are of much importance as well. The &quot;non-gravimetric&quot; QCM is by no means an alternative to the conventional QCM. Many researchers, who use quartz resonators for purposes other than gravimetry, have continued to call the quartz crystal resonator &quot;QCM&quot;. Actually, the term &quot;balance&quot; makes sense even for non-gravimetric applications if it is understood in the sense of a force balance. At resonance, the force exerted upon the crystal by the sample is balanced by a force originating from the shear gradient inside the crystal. This is the essence of the small-load approximation.

The QCM measures inertial mass, and therefore by operating at a high resonant frequency it can be made very sensitive to small changes in that inertia as material is added to (or removed from) its surface. The sensitivity of gravitational mass measurements is, by comparison, limited by the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field strength. We normally think of a balance as a way of measuring (or comparing) gravitational mass, as measured by the force that the earth exerts on the body being weighed. A few experiments have demonstrated a direct link between QCM and the SI system by comparing traceable (gravitational mass) weighings with QCM measurements. 
Crystalline α–quartz is by far the most important material for thickness-shear resonators. Langasite (La3Ga5SiO14, &quot;LGS&quot;) and gallium-orthophosphate (GaPO4) are investigated as alternatives to quartz, mainly (but not only) for use at high temperatures. Such devices are also called &quot;QCM&quot;, even though they are not made out of quartz (and may or may not be used for gravimetry).

== Surface acoustic wave-based sensors ==
The QCM is a member of a wider class of sensing instruments based on acoustic waves at surfaces. Instruments sharing similar principles of operation are shear horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) devices, Love-wave devices and torsional resonators. Surface acoustic wave-based devices make use of the fact that the reflectivity of an acoustic wave at the crystal surface depends on the impedance (the stress-to-speed ratio) of the adjacent medium. (Some acoustic sensors for temperature or pressure make use of the fact that the speed of sound inside the crystal depends on temperature, pressure, or bending. These sensors do not exploit surface effects.) In the context of surface-acoustic wave based sensing, the QCM is also termed &quot;bulk acoustic wave resonator (BAW-resonator)&quot; or &quot;thickness-shear resonator&quot;. The displacement pattern of an unloaded BAW resonator is a standing shear wave with anti-nodes at the crystal surface. This makes the analysis particularly easy and transparent.

== Instrumental ==

=== Resonator crystals ===
When the QCM was first developed, natural quartz was harvested, selected for its quality and then cut in the lab. However, most of today&#x27;s crystals are grown using seed crystals. A seed crystal serves as an anchoring point and template for crystal growth. Grown crystals are subsequently cut and polished into hair-thin discs which support thickness shear resonance in the 1-30 MHz range. The &quot;AT&quot; or &quot;SC&quot; oriented cuts (discussed below) are widely used in applications.

=== Electromechanical coupling ===
The QCM consists of a thin piezoelectric plate with electrodes evaporated onto both sides. Due to the piezo-effect, an AC voltage across the electrodes induces a shear deformation and vice versa. The electromechanical coupling provides a simple way to detect an acoustic resonance by electrical means. Otherwise, it is of minor importance. However, electromechanical coupling can have a slight influence on the resonance frequency via piezoelectric stiffening. This effect can be used for sensing, but is usually avoided. It is essential to have the electric and dielectric boundary conditions well under control. Grounding the front electrode (the electrode in contact with the sample) is one option. A π-network sometimes is employed for the same reason. A π-network is an arrangement of resistors, which almost short-circuit the two electrodes. This makes the device less susceptible to electrical perturbations.

=== Shear waves decay in liquids and gases ===
Most acoustic-wave-based sensors employ shear (transverse) waves. Shear waves decay rapidly in liquid and gaseous environments. Compressional (longitudinal) waves would be radiated into the bulk and potentially be reflected back to the crystal from the opposing cell wall. Such reflections are avoided with transverse waves. The range of penetration of a 5 MHz-shear wave in water is 250 nm. This finite penetration depth renders the QCM surface-specific. Also, liquids and gases have a rather small shear-acoustic impedance and therefore only weakly damp the oscillation. The exceptionally high Q-factors of acoustic resonators are linked to their weak coupling to the environment.

=== Modes of operation ===
Economic ways of driving a QCM make use of oscillator circuits. Oscillator circuits are also widely employed in time and frequency control applications, where the oscillator serves as a clock. Other modes of operation are impedance analysis, QCM-I, and ring-down, QCM-D. In impedance analysis, the electric conductance as a function of driving frequency is determined by means of a network analyzer. By fitting a resonance curve to the conductance curve, one obtains the frequency and bandwidth of the resonance as fit parameters. In ring-down, one measures the voltage between the electrodes after the exciting voltage has suddenly been turned off. The resonator emits a decaying sine wave, where the resonance parameters are extracted from the period of oscillation and the decay rate.


=== Energy trapping ===
To avoid dissipation of vibration energy (damping the oscillation) by the crystal holder, which touches the crystal at the rim, the vibration should be confined to the center of the crystal platelet. This is known as energy trapping.

For crystals with high frequencies (10 MHz and higher), the electrodes at the front and the back of the crystal usually are key-hole shaped, thereby making the resonator thicker in the center than at the rim. The mass of the electrodes confines the displacement field to the center of the crystal disk. QCM crystals with vibration frequencies around 5 or 6 MHz usually have a planoconvex shape; at the rim the crystal is too thin for a standing wave with the resonance frequency.
Thus, in both cases the thickness-shear vibration amplitude is greatest at the center of the disk. This means that the mass-sensitivity is peaked at the center also, with this sensitivity declining smoothly to zero towards the rim (For high-frequency crystals, the amplitude vanishes already somewhat outside the perimeter of the smallest electrode.) The mass-sensitivity is therefore very non-uniform across the crystal surface, and this non-uniformity is a function of the mass-distribution of the metal electrodes (or in the case of non-planar resonators, the quartz crystal thickness itself).

Energy trapping slightly distorts the otherwise planar wave fronts. The deviation from the plane thickness-shear mode entails flexural contribution to the displacement pattern. If the crystal is not operated in vacuum, flexural waves emit compressional waves into the adjacent medium, which is a problem when operating the crystal in a liquid environment. Standing compressional waves form in the liquid between the crystals and the container walls (or the liquid surface); these waves modify both the frequency and the damping of the crystal resonator.

=== Overtones ===
Planar resonators can be operated at a number of overtones, typically indexed by the number of nodal planes parallel to the crystal surfaces. Only odd harmonics can be excited electrically because only these induce charges of opposite sign at the two crystal surfaces. Overtones are to be distinguished from anharmonic side bands (spurious modes), which have nodal planes perpendicular to the plane of the resonator. The best agreement between theory and experiment is reached with planar, optically polished crystals for overtone orders between &quot;n&quot; = 5 and &quot;n&quot; = 13. On low harmonics, energy trapping is insufficient, while on high harmonics, anharmonic side bands interfere with the main resonance.

=== Amplitude of motion ===
The amplitude of lateral displacement rarely exceeds a nanometer. More specifically one has

formula_1

with &quot;u&quot;0 the amplitude of lateral displacement, &quot;n&quot; the overtone order, &quot;d&quot; the piezoelectric strain coefficient, &quot;Q&quot; the quality factor, and &quot;U&quot;el the amplitude of electrical driving. The piezoelectric strain coefficient is given as &quot;d&quot; = 3.1·10‑12 m/V for AT-cut quartz crystals. Due to the small amplitude, stress and strain usually are proportional to each other. The QCM operates in the range of linear acoustics.

=== Effects of temperature and stress ===
The resonance frequency of acoustic resonators depends on temperature, pressure, and bending stress. Temperature-frequency coupling is minimized by employing special crystal cuts. A widely used temperature-compensated cut of quartz is the AT-cut. Careful control of temperature and stress is essential in the operation of the QCM.

AT-cut crystals are singularly rotated Y-axis cuts in which the top and bottom half of the crystal move in opposite directions (thickness shear vibration) during oscillation. 
The AT-cut crystal is easily manufactured. However, it has limitations at high and low temperature, as it is easily disrupted by internal stresses caused by temperature gradients in these temperature extremes (relative to room temperature, ~25 °C). These internal stress points produce undesirable frequency shifts in the crystal, decreasing its accuracy. The relationship between temperature and frequency is cubic. The cubic relationship has an inflection point near room temperature. As a consequence the AT-cut quartz crystal is most effective when operating at or near room temperature. For applications which are above room temperature, water cooling is often helpful.

Stress-compensated (SC) crystals are available with a doubly rotated cut that minimizes the frequency changes due to temperature gradients when the system is operating at high temperatures, and reduces the reliance on water cooling. SC-cut crystals have an inflection point of ~92 °C. In addition to their high temperature inflection point, they also have a smoother cubic relationship and are less affected by temperature deviations from the inflection point. However, due to the more difficult manufacturing process, they are more expensive and are not widely commercially available.

=== Electrochemical QCM ===

The QCM can be combined with other surface-analytical instruments. The electrochemical QCM (EQCM) is particularly advanced. Using the EQCM, one determines the ratio of mass deposited at the electrode surface during an electrochemical reaction to the total charge passed through the electrode. This ratio is called the current efficiency.

== Quantification of dissipative processes ==
For advanced QCMs, such as QCM-I and QCM-D, both the resonance frequency, &quot;f&quot;r, and the bandwidth, &quot;w&quot;, are available for analysis. The latter quantifies processes which withdraw energy from the oscillation. These may include damping by the holder and ohmic losses inside the electrode or the crystal. In the literature some parameters other than &quot;w&quot; itself are used to quantify bandwidth. The Q-factor (quality factor) is given by &quot;Q&quot; = &quot;f&quot;r/&quot;w&quot;. The “dissipation factor”, &quot;D&quot;, is the inverse of the Q-factor: &quot;D&quot; = &quot;Q&quot;−1 = &quot;w&quot;/&quot;f&quot;r. The half-band-half-width, Γ, is Γ = &quot;w&quot;/2. The use of Γ is motivated by a complex formulation of the equations governing the motion of the crystal. A complex resonance frequency is defined as &quot;f&quot;r* = &quot;f&quot;r + iΓ, where the imaginary part, Γ, is half the bandwidth at half maximum. Using a complex notation, one can treat shifts of frequency, Δ&quot;f&quot;, and bandwidth, ΔΓ, within the same set of (complex) equations.

The motional resistance of the resonator, &quot;R&quot;1, is also used as a measure of dissipation. &quot;R&quot;1 is an output parameter of some instruments based on advanced oscillator circuits. &quot;R&quot;1 usually is not strictly proportional to the bandwidth (although it should be according to the BvD circuit; see below). Also, in absolute terms, &quot;R&quot;1 – being an electrical quantity and not a frequency – is more severely affected by calibration problems than the bandwidth.

== Equivalent circuits ==
Modeling of acoustic resonators often occurs with equivalent electrical circuits. Equivalent circuits are algebraically equivalent to the continuum mechanics description and to a description in terms of acoustic reflectivities. They provide for a graphical representation of the resonator&#x27;s properties and their shifts upon loading. These representations are not just cartoons. They are tools to predict the shift of the resonance parameters in response to the addition of the load.

Equivalent circuits build on the electromechanical analogy. In the same way as the current through a network of resistors can be predicted from their arrangement and the applied voltage, the displacement of a network of mechanical elements can be predicted from the topology of the network and the applied force. The electro-mechanical analogy maps forces onto voltages and speeds onto currents. The ratio of force and speed is termed &quot;mechanical impedance&quot;. Note: Here, speed means the time derivative of a displacement, not the speed of sound. There also is an electro-acoustic analogy, within which stresses (rather than forces) are mapped onto voltages. In acoustics, forces are normalized to area. The ratio of stress and speed should not be called &quot;acoustic impedance&quot; (in analogy to the mechanical impedance) because this term is already in use for the material property &quot;Z&quot;ac = ρ&quot;c&quot; with ρ the density and &quot;c&quot; the speed of sound). The ratio of stress and speed at the crystal surface is called load impedance, &quot;Z&quot;L. Synonymous terms are &quot;surface impedance&quot; and &quot;acoustic load.&quot; The load impedance is in general not equal to the material constant &quot;Z&quot;ac = ρ&quot;c&quot; = (&quot;G&quot;ρ)1/2. Only for propagating plane waves are the values of &quot;Z&quot;L and &quot;Z&quot;ac the same.

The electro-mechanical analogy provides for mechanical equivalents of a resistor, an inductance, and a capacitance, which are the dashpot (quantified by the drag coefficient, ξp), the point mass (quantified by the mass, &quot;m&quot;p), and the spring (quantified by the spring constant, κp). For a dashpot, the impedance by definition is &quot;Z&quot;m=&quot;F&quot; / (d&quot;u&quot;/d&quot;t&quot;)=ξm with &quot;F&quot; the force and (d&quot;u&quot;/d&quot;t&quot;) the speed). For a point mass undergoing oscillatory motion &quot;u&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;u&quot;0 exp(iω&quot;t&quot;) we have &quot;Z&quot;m = iω&quot;m&quot;p. The spring obeys &quot;Z&quot;m =κp/(iω). Piezoelectric coupling is depicted as a transformer. It is characterized by a parameter φ. While φ is dimensionless for usual transformers (the turns ratio), it has the dimension charge/length in the case of electromechanical coupling. The transformer acts as an impedance converter in the sense that a mechanical impedance, &quot;Z&quot;m, appears as an electrical impedance, &quot;Z&quot;el, across the electrical ports. &quot; Z&quot;el is given by &quot;Z&quot;el = φ2 &quot;Z&quot;m. For planar piezoelectric crystals, φ takes the value φ = &quot;Ae&quot;/&quot;d&quot;q, where &quot;A&quot; is the effective area, &quot;e&quot; is the piezoelectric stress coefficient (&quot;e&quot; = 9.65·10−2 C/m2 for AT-cut quartz) and &quot;d&quot;q is the thickness of the plate. The transformer often is not explicitly depicted. Rather, the mechanical elements are directly depicted as electrical elements (capacitor replaces a spring, etc.).

There is a pitfall with the application of the electro-mechanical analogy, which has to do with how networks are drawn. When a spring pulls onto a dashpot, one would usually draw the two elements in series. However, when applying the electro-mechanical analogy, the two elements have to be placed in parallel. For two parallel electrical elements the currents are additive. Since the speeds (= currents) add when placing a spring behind a dashpot, this assembly has to be represented by a parallel network.

The figure on the right shows the Butterworth-van Dyke (BvD) equivalent circuit. The acoustic properties of the crystal are represented by the motional inductance, &quot;L&quot;1, the motional capacitance, &quot;C&quot;1, and the motional resistance &quot;R&quot;1. &quot;Z&quot;L is the load impedance. Note that the load, &quot;Z&quot;L, cannot be determined from a single measurement. It is inferred from the comparison of the loaded and the unloaded state. Some authors use the BvD circuit without the load &quot;Z&quot;L. This circuit is also called “four element network”. The values of &quot;L&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;1, and &quot;R&quot;1 then change their value in the presence of the load (they do not if the element &quot;Z&quot;L is explicitly included).

== Small-load approximation ==
The BvD circuit predicts the resonance parameters. One can show that the following simple relation holds as long as the frequency shift is much smaller than the frequency itself:

formula_2

&quot;f&quot;f is the frequency of the fundamental. &quot;Z&quot;q is the acoustic impedance of material. For AT-cut quartz, its value is &quot;Z&quot;q = 8.8·106 kg m−2 s−1.

The small-load approximation is central to the interpretation of QCM-data. It holds for arbitrary samples and can be applied in an average sense. Assume that the sample is a complex material, such as a cell culture, a sand pile, a froth, an assembly of spheres or vesicles, or a droplet. If the average stress-to-speed ratio of the sample at the crystal surface (the load impedance, &quot;Z&quot;L) can be calculated in one way or another, a quantitative analysis of the QCM experiment is in reach. Otherwise, the interpretation will have to remain qualitative.

The limits of the small-load approximation are noticed either when the frequency shift is large or when the overtone-dependence of Δ&quot;f&quot; and Δ(&quot;w&quot;/2) is analyzed in detail in order to derive the viscoelastic properties of the sample. A more general relation is

formula_3

This equation is implicit in Δ&quot;f&quot;*, and must be solved numerically. Approximate solutions also exist, which go beyond the small-load approximation. The small-load approximation is the first order solution of a perturbation analysis.

The definition of the load impedance implicitly assumes that stress and speed are proportional and that the ratio therefore is independent of speed. This assumption is justified when the crystal is operated in liquids and in air. The laws of linear acoustics then hold. However, when the crystal is in contact with a rough surface, stress can easily become a nonlinear function of strain (and speed) because the stress is transmitted across a finite number of rather small load-bearing asperities. The stress at the points of contact is high, and phenomena like slip, partial slip, yield, etc. set in. These are part of non-linear acoustics. There is a generalization of the small-load equation dealing with this problem. If the stress, σ(&quot;t&quot;), is periodic in time and synchronous with the crystal oscillation one has

formula_4

formula_5

Angular brackets denote a time average and σ(&quot;t&quot;) is the (small) stress exerted by the external surface. The function σ(t) may or may not be harmonic. One can always test for nonlinear behavior by checking for a dependence of the resonance parameters on the driving voltage. If linear acoustics hold, there is no drive level-dependence. Note, however, that quartz crystals have an intrinsic drive level-dependence, which must not be confused with nonlinear interactions between the crystal and the sample.

== Viscoelastic modeling ==

=== Assumptions ===
For a number of experimental configurations, there are explicit expressions relating the shifts of frequency and bandwidth to the sample properties. The assumptions underlying the equations are the following:

* The resonator and all cover layers are laterally homogeneous and infinite.
* The distortion of the crystal is given by a transverse plane wave with the wave-vector perpendicular to the surface normal (thickness-shear mode). There are neither compressional waves nor flexural contributions to the displacement pattern. There are no nodal lines in the plane of the resonator.
* All stresses are proportional to strain. Linear viscoelasticity holds.
* Piezoelectric stiffening may be ignored.

=== Semi-infinite viscoelastic medium ===
For a semi-infinite medium, one has

formula_6

formula_7

η’ and η’’ are the real and the imaginary part of the viscosity, respectively. &quot;Z&quot;ac = ρ&quot;c&quot; =(&quot;G&quot; ρ)1/2 is the acoustic impedance of the medium. ρ is the density, &quot;c&quot;, the speed of sound, and &quot;G&quot; = i ωη is the shear modulus.
For Newtonian liquids (η’ = const, η’’ = 0), Δ&quot;f&quot; and Δ(&quot;w&quot;/2) are equal and opposite. They scale as the square root of the overtone order, &quot;n&quot;1/2. For viscoelastic liquids (η’ = η(ω), η’’≠ 0), the complex viscosity can be obtained as

formula_8

formula_9

Importantly, the QCM only probes the region close to the crystal surface. The shear wave evanescently decays into the liquid. In water the penetration depth is about 250 nm at 5 MHz. Surface roughness, nano-bubbles at the surface, slip, and compressional waves can interfere with the measurement of viscosity. Also, the viscosity determined at MHz frequencies sometimes differs from the low-frequency viscosity. In this respect, torsional resonators (with a frequency around 100 kHz) are closer to application than thickness-shear resonators.

=== Inertial loading (Sauerbrey equation) ===

The frequency shift induced by a thin sample which is rigidly coupled to the crystal (such as a thin film), is described by the Sauerbrey equation. The stress is governed by inertia, which implies σ = -ω2&quot;u&quot;0&quot;m&quot;F, where &quot;u&quot;0 is the amplitude of oscillation and &quot;m&quot;F is the (average) mass per unit area. Inserting this result into the small-load-approximation one finds

formula_10

If the density of the film is known, one can convert from mass per unit area, &quot;m&quot;F, to thickness, &quot;d&quot;F. The thickness thus derived is also called the Sauerbrey thickness to show that it was derived by applying the Sauerbrey equation to the frequency shift.
The shift in bandwidth is zero if the Sauerbrey equation holds. Checking for the bandwidth therefore amounts to checking the applicability of the Sauerbrey equation.

The Sauerbrey equation was first derived by Günter Sauerbrey in 1959 and correlates changes in the oscillation frequency of a piezoelectric crystal with mass deposited on it. He simultaneously developed a method for measuring the resonance frequency and its changes by using the crystal as the frequency-determining component of an oscillator circuit. His method continues to be used as the primary tool in quartz crystal microbalance experiments for conversion of frequency to mass.

Because the film is treated as an extension of thickness, Sauerbrey’s equation only applies to systems in which (a) the deposited mass has the same acoustic properties as the crystal and (b) the frequency change is small (Δ&quot;f&quot; / &quot;f&quot; &lt; 0.05).

If the change in frequency is greater than 5%, that is, Δ&quot;f&quot; / &quot;f&quot; &gt; 0.05, the Z-match method must be used to determine the change in mass. The formula for the Z-match method is:

formula_11

&quot;k&quot;F is the wave vector inside the film and &quot;d&quot;F its thickness. Inserting &quot;k&quot;F = 2·π·&quot;f&quot; /cF = 2·π·&quot;f&quot;·ρF / &quot;Z&quot;F as well as &quot;d&quot;F = &quot;m&quot;F / ρF yields

formula_12

=== Viscoelastic film ===
For a viscoelastic film, the frequency shift is

formula_13

Here &quot;Z&quot;F is the acoustic impedance of the film (&quot;Z&quot;F = ρF&quot;c&quot;F = (ρF&quot;G&quot;f)1/2)= (ρF/&quot;J&quot;f)1/2), &quot;k&quot;F is the wave vector and &quot;d&quot;F is the film thickness. &quot;J&quot;f is the film&#x27;s viscoelastic compliance, ρF is the density.

The poles of the tangent (&quot;k&quot;F &quot;d&quot;F = π/2) define the film resonances. At the film resonance, one has &quot;d&quot;F = λ/4. The agreement between experiment and theory is often poor close to the film resonance. Typically, the QCM only works well for film thicknesses much less than a quarter of the wavelength of sound (corresponding to a few micrometres, depending on the softness of the film and the overtone order).

Note that the properties of a film as determined with the QCM are fully specified by two parameters, which are its acoustic impedance, &quot;Z&quot;F = ρF&quot;c&quot;F and its mass per unit area, &quot;m&quot;F = &quot;d&quot;F/ρF. The wave number &quot;k&quot;F = ω/&quot;c&quot;F is not algebraically independent from &quot;Z&quot;F and &quot;m&quot;F. Unless the density of the film is known independently, the QCM can only measure mass per unit area, never the geometric thickness itself.

=== Viscoelastic film in liquid ===
For a film immersed in a liquid environment, the frequency shift is

formula_14

The indices &quot;F&quot; and &quot;Liq&quot; denote the film and the liquid. Here, the reference state is the crystal immersed in liquid (but not covered with a film). For thin films, one can Taylor-expand the above equation to first order in &quot;d&quot;F, yielding

formula_15

Apart from the term in brackets, this equation is equivalent to the Sauerbrey equation. The term in brackets is a viscoelastic correction, dealing with the fact that in liquids, soft layers lead to a smaller Sauerbrey thickness than rigid layers.

=== Derivation of viscoelastic constants ===
The frequency shift depends on the acoustic impedance of the material; the latter in turn depends on the viscoelastic properties of the material. Therefore, in principle, one can derive the complex shear modulus (or equivalently, the complex viscosity). However, there are certain caveats to be kept in mind:

* The viscoelastic parameters themselves usually depend on frequency (and therefore on the overtone order).
* It is often difficult to disentangle effects of inertia and viscoelasticity. Unless the film thickness is known independently, it is difficult to obtain unique fitting results.
* Electrode effects can be of importance.
* For films in air, the small-load approximation must be replaced by the corresponding results from perturbation theory unless the films are very soft.

For thin films in liquids, there is an approximate analytical result, relating the elastic compliance of the film, &quot;J&quot;F’ to the ratio of Δ(w/2); and Δ&quot;f&quot;. The shear compliance is the inverse of the shear modulus, &quot;G&quot;. In the thin-film limit, the ratio of Δ(w/2) and –Δ&quot;f&quot; is independent of film thickness. It is an intrinsic property of the film. One has

formula_16

For thin films in air an analogous analytical result is

formula_17

Here &quot;J&quot;’’ is the viscous shear compliance.

=== Interpretation of the Sauerbrey thickness ===
The correct interpretation of the frequency shift from QCM experiments in liquids is a challenge. Practitioners often just apply the Sauerbrey equation to their data and term the resulting areal mass (mass per unit area) the &quot;Sauerbrey mass&quot; and the corresponding thickness &quot;Sauerbrey thickness&quot;. Even though the Sauerbrey thickness can certainly serve to compare different experiments, it must not be naively identified with the geometric thickness. Worthwhile considerations are the following:

a) The QCM always measures an areal mass density, never a geometric thickness. The conversion from areal mass density to thickness usually requires the physical density as an independent input.
b) It is difficult to infer the viscoelastic correction factor from QCM data. However, if the correction factor differs significantly from unity, it may be expected that it affects the bandwidth Δ(w/2) and also that it depends on overtone order. If, conversely, such effects are absent (Δ(&quot;w&quot;/2) « Δ&quot;f&quot;, Sauerbrey thickness same on all overtone orders) one may assume that (1-&quot;Z&quot;Liq2/&quot;Z&quot;F2)≈1.

c) Complex samples are often laterally heterogeneous.

d) Complex samples often have fuzzy interfaces. A &quot;fluffy&quot; interface will often lead to a viscoelastic correction and, as a consequence, to a non-zero Δ(&quot;w&quot;/2) as well as an overtone-dependent Sauerbrey mass. In the absence of such effects, one may conclude that the outer interface of film is sharp.

e) When the viscoelastic correction, as discussed in (b), is insignificant, this does by no means imply that the film is not swollen by the solvent. It only means that the (swollen) film is much more rigid than the ambient liquid. QCM data taken on the wet sample alone do not allow inference of the degree of swelling. The amount of swelling can be inferred from the comparison of the wet and the dry thickness. The degree of swelling is also accessible by comparing the acoustic thickness (in the Sauerbrey sense) to the optical thickness as determined by, for example, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy or ellipsometry. Solvent contained in the film usually does contribute to the acoustic thickness (because it takes part in the movement), whereas it does not contribute to the optic thickness (because the electronic polarizability of a solvent molecule does not change when it is located inside a film). The difference in dry and wet mass is shown with QCM-D and MP-SPR for instance in protein adsorption on nanocellulose and in other soft materials.

== Point contacts ==
The equations concerning viscoelastic properties assume planar layer systems. A frequency shift is also induced when the crystal makes contact with discrete objects across small, load-bearing asperities. Such contacts are often encountered with rough surfaces. It is assumed that the stress–speed ratio may be replaced by an average stress–speed ratio, where the average stress just is the lateral force divided by the active area of the crystal.

Often, the external object is so heavy that it does not take part in the MHz oscillation of the crystal due to inertia. It then rests in place in the laboratory frame. When the crystal surface is laterally displaced, the contact exerts a restoring force upon the crystal surface. The stress is proportional to the number density of the contacts, &quot;N&quot;S, and their average spring constant, κS. The spring constant may be complex (κS* = κS’ + iκS’’), where the imaginary part quantifies a withdrawal of energy from the crystal oscillation (for instance due to viscoelastic effects). For such a situation, the small-load approximation predicts

formula_18

The QCM allows for non-destructive testing of the shear stiffness of multi-asperity contacts.

<doc id="1236087" wikidata="Q19805959" url="?curid=1236087" title="Sultanate of Golconda">
<text>The Sultanate of Golconda (; ) was an early modern kingdom in southern India, ruled by the Persianate, Shia Islamic Qutb Shahi dynasty of Turkoman origin. After the decline of the Bahmani Sultanate, the Sultanate of Golconda was established in 1518 by Quli Qutb Shah, as one of the five Deccan sultanates.

The kingdom extended from parts of the modern-day Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Telangana. The Golconda sultanate was constantly in conflict with the Adil Shahis and Nizam Shahis, which it shared borders with in the seventeenth century to the west and northwest. In 1636, Mughal emperor Shah Jahan forced the Qutb Shahis to recognize Mughal suzerainty and pay periodic tributes. The dynasty came to an end in 1687 during the reign of its seventh sultan Abul Hasan Qutb Shah, when the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb arrested and jailed Abul Hasan for the rest of his life in Daulatabad, incorporating Golconda into the Mughal empire.

The Qutb Shahis were patrons of Persianate Shia culture. The official and court language of the Golconda sultanate during the first 90 years of its existence (c. 1518 – 1600) was also Persian. In the early 17th century, however, the Telugu language was elevated to the status of the Persian language, while towards the end of the Qut Shahis&#x27; rule, it was the primary court language with Persian used occasionally in official documents. According to Indologist Richard Eaton, as Qutb Shahis adopted Telugu, they started seeing their polity as the Telugu-speaking state, with the elites of the sultanate viewing their rulers as &quot;Telugu Sultans&quot;.

==History==
The dynasty&#x27;s founder, Sultan Quli Khawas Khan Hamdani was born in Hamadan, Iran. He belonged to the Qara Qoyunlu, a Turkmen Muslim tribe and therefore a descendant of Qara Yusuf. In the 16th century, he migrated to Delhi with his uncle, Allah-Quli, some of his relatives and friends. Later he migrated south, to the Deccan and served the Bahmani sultan, Mahmood Shah Bahmani II, who was of Deccani Muslim ethnicity. He declared the independence of Golconda after the disintegration of the Bahmani Sultanate into the five Deccan sultanates. He took the title &quot;Qutb Shah&quot;, and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda. He was assassinated in 1543 by his son, Jamsheed, who assumed control of the sultanate. Jamsheed died in 1550 from cancer. Jamsheed&#x27;s young son Subhan Quli Qutb Shah reigned for a year, at which time the nobility brought back and installed Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah as sultan.

Golconda, and with the construction of the Char Minar, later Hyderabad, served as capitals of the sultanate, and both cities were embellished by the Qutb Shahi sultans. The dynasty ruled Golconda for 171 years, until Aurangzeb, in his campaigns in the Deccan, conquered the Sultanate of Golconda in 1687 with the completion of his siege of Golconda. The sultante&#x27;s last ruler, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah, was imprisoned in Daulatabad Fort, and the territory of the Golconda Sultanate was made into a Mughal imperial province, Hyderabad Subah.

== Economy ==

The Golconda Sultanate was notoriously wealthy. While its primary source of revenue was a land tax, the sultanate greatly profited from its monopoly on diamond production from mines in the southern districts of the kingdom. The sultanate also had control over the Krishna and Godavari deltas, giving it access to craft production in the villages of the area, where goods like textiles were produced. The town of Masulipatnam served as the Golconda Sultanate&#x27;s primary seaport for the export of diamonds and textiles. The kingdom reached the peak of its financial prosperity in the 1620s and 1630s.
=== Diamonds ===
The Golconda Sultanate was known for its diamonds which were dubbed the Golconda diamonds. These diamonds were sought after diamonds long before the Qutb Shahi dynasty came to power, and they continued to supply this demand through European traders.
Diamonds from mines (especially the Kollur Mine presently in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh) were transported to the city of Hyderabad to be cut, polished, evaluated and sold. Golconda established itself as a diamond trading centre and until the end of the 19th century, the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and largest diamonds in the world.

=== Cotton-weaving ===
During the early seventeenth century, a strong cotton-weaving industry existed in the Deccan region. Large quantities of cotton cloth were produced for domestic and export consumption. High-quality plain and patterned cloth made of muslin and calico was produced. Plain cloth was available in white or brown colour, in bleached or dyed variety. This cloth was exported to Persia and European countries. The patterned cloth was made of prints which were made indigenously with indigo for blue, chay-root for red coloured prints and vegetable yellow. Patterned cloth exports were mainly to Java, Sumatra and other eastern countries. Golconda had a strong trading relationship with Ayutthaya Siam.

==Culture==

The Qutb Shahis were patrons of Persianate Shia culture. Over the first 90 years of their rule (c. 1518 – 1600), they championed Persian culture. Their official edicts and court language were in Persian only. Quli Qutb Mulk&#x27;s court became a haven for Persian culture and literature. In early 17th-century, with Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah (1580–1612) a change began. He began to patronize the Telugu language and culture as well. Edicts began to be issued both in Persian and Telugu. Towards the end of the dynasty, these were primarily in Telugu with a summary in Persian. As they adopted Telugu, they saw their territory as the Telugu-speaking region, states Indologist Richard Eaton, with their elites considering the rulers as &quot;Telugu Sultans&quot;.

Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah (1580–1612) wrote poems in Dakhini Urdu, Persian and Telugu. Subsequent poets and writers, however, wrote in Urdu, while using vocabulary from Persian, Hindi and Telugu languages. During the reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah in 1634 AD, an ancient Sanskrit text on love and sex &quot;Ratirahasya&quot; by Kokkoka was translated into Persian and named &quot;Lazzat-un-Nisa&quot; (Flavors of the Woman).

=== Architecture ===
The Qutb Shahi architecture was Indo-Islamic, a culmination of Indian and Persian architectural styles. Their style was very similar to that of the other Deccan Sultanates. The Qutb Shahi rulers built the Char Minar.

Some examples of Qutb Shahi Indo-Islamic architecture are the Golconda Fort, tombs of the Qutb Shahis, Char Minar and the Char Kaman, Makkah Masjid, Khairatabad Mosque, Hayat Bakshi Mosque, Taramati Baradari and the Toli Mosque.

===Tombs===

The tombs of the Qutb Shahi sultans lie about one kilometre north of Golkonda&#x27;s outer wall. These structures are made of beautifully carved stonework, and surrounded by landscaped gardens. They are open to the public and receive many visitors.

== Administration ==

The Qutb Shahi Kingdom was a highly centralized state. The sultan enjoyed absolute executive judicial and military powers. When he was away, a regent carried to carry on the administration on behalf of the king. The &quot;Peshwa&quot; (Prime Minister) was the highest official of the sultanate. He was assisted by a number of ministers, including &quot;Mir Jumla&quot; (finance minister), &quot;Kotwal&quot; (police commissioner), and &quot;Khazanadar&quot; (treasurer).

For most of their reign, the Qutb Shahi sultanate had a system of jagirs, who would provide troops as well as collect taxes. They were allowed to keep a portion of the taxes and give the sultan the rest. Tax collection was through auction farms, and the highest bidder used to get the Governorship. While the Governors enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle, they had to bear the brunt of severe punishments for default, consequently, they were harsh on the people. Tana Shah – the last Sultan, with advice from his Brahmin ministers responsible for tax collection, introduced a reform whereby all taxes were collected by civil professionals for a region. The soldiers, government workers, court officials and all the Muslim elites were paid allowances from the Sultan&#x27;s treasury. These reforms brought a large increase in revenues.

According to Moreland, in the earlier system, the Persian-origin Muslims were paid the highest, then the other Indian Muslims. In early 17th century, the Persian origin Muslims became rich by lending money on high interest (usury) of 4-5% per &quot;mensem&quot; much to the despair of Hindus.

The Sultanate had 66 forts, and each fort was administered by a &quot;Nayak&quot;. In the second half of the 17th century, the Qutb Shahi Sultan hired many Hindu Nayaks. According to Kruijtzer, these were mainly Brahmins. According to another account, these were mainly from the Kamma, Velama, Kapu, and Raju warrior castes. They served as civil revenue officers. After the Mughals dismissed the Qutb Shahi dynasty in 1687, these Hindu Nayaks were also dismissed and replaced with Muslim military commanders.

=== Administrative divisions ===

The sultanate in 1670 comprised 21 &quot;sarkars&quot; (provinces) which in turn were divided into 355 &quot;parganas&quot; (districts).

==Religion==
The Qutb Shahi dynasty, like many Deccan Islamic dynasties, was a Shia Muslim dynasty with roots in Persia (modern Iran). Initially, they were very strict and they persecuted the Hindus who constituted the vast majority of the population. Open practice of Hindu festivals was forbidden in the Golconda Sultanate. It was Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah who first reversed this policy, and allowed Hindus to practice their festivals and religion in the open.
In the final decades of their rule, the Qutb Shahi dynasty rulers patronized Shia, Sufi, and Sunni Islamic traditions, as well as Hindu traditions. Before their end, Tana Shah advised by Madanna and Akkanna –his Brahmin ministers, began the tradition of sending pearls to the Bhadrachalam Temple of Rama on Rama Navami.

<text>The Chondoist Chongu Party () is a united front party in North Korea. The party was founded on 8 February 1946 by a group of followers of the Ch&#x27;ŏndogyo. The party increasingly came under the influence of the government over time and is now under the effective control of the ruling Workers&#x27; Party of Korea. The founding-leader of the party was Kim Tarhyon.

The party is headquartered in the capital Pyongyang.

==History==
The Ch&#x27;ŏndogyo religious ideology was originated by Donghak Koreans in response to the Christian missionary activities in Korea in the end of the nineteenth century. The Ch&#x27;ŏndogyo became a hotbed of Korean nationalism. Ch&#x27;ŏndo farmers participated in the Donghak Peasant Revolution in 1894 and the movement played an important role in the &quot;March 1st Movement&quot; in 1919. The communist parties of the Soviet Union and Korea perceived Ch&#x27;ŏndogyo as a &quot;utopian peasant movement&quot;. By 1945, Ch&#x27;ŏndogyo had become the second largest religion in northern Korea, with believers.

The Chondoist Chongu Party was established on 8 February 1946 with Ch&#x27;ŏndogyo activist Kim Tarhyon as its first leader. It assembled 98,000 members after a few months of existence, and was larger (in membership) than the Communist Party of Korea. In December 1946 it had 204,387 members.

On 22 July 1946, the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea was formed as a united front. The Chondoist Chongu Party was one of the four parties included in it. Thus the subordination of the party to the Communist Party of Korea was formalised.

In the 1946–1947 elections to people&#x27;s committees, village people&#x27;s committees and &quot;myŏn&quot; people&#x27;s committees, about 5.3 percent of the 70,454 elected deputies belonged to the Chondoist Chongu Party. Kim Tarhyon became one of two deputy chairmen of the People&#x27;s Assembly (the national parliament). During the first session of the People&#x27;s Assembly, a Chondoist Chongu Party deputy, Kim Yun-gol (), held a critical speech against the non-compliance with laws passed by the people&#x27;s committees during the land reform process. Kim Yun-gol was fiercely attacked, and he retracted his statement.

When the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) was constituted in 1948, the Chondoist Chongu Party obtained 16.5 percent of the seats in the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly.

However, the situation for the party soon turned difficult. Large sections of the Soviet and North Korean communist leaderships did not trust the party, and saw it as a potential nest for counterrevolutionaries. The most troublesome issue was that the North Korean Ch&#x27;ŏndogyo continued to have contacts with the leadership of the religious group in South Korean Seoul. There, the Ch&#x27;ŏndogyo leadership was anti-communist and supported the administration of President Syngman Rhee. In January 1948, the Ch&#x27;ŏndogyo leadership based in Seoul made a decision that a massive anti-communist demonstration would be held on 1 March in Pyongyang. This put the Chondoist Chongu Party in the North in a precarious situation. Kim Tarhyon refused to follow the orders from Seoul, but others in the party leadership wanted to go ahead with the plans. The result was a massive purge of party members throughout North Korea. In its aftermath, the anti-communist sections of the movement initiated an underground resistance movement and tried to launch guerrilla warfare.

Kim Tarhyon and the people around him reaffirmed their loyalty to the DPRK. In 1950 the Chondoist Chongu Party in the South (but not the religious movement) united with the Northern party under his leadership. During the Korean War the headquarters of the party was shifted to a town near the border with China. The party leadership actively supported the DPRK war efforts, but many party cadres migrated to South Korea during the war. Many sided with Seoul during the war. In the aftermath of the war, the idea of the united front was increasingly unpopular in the North Korean government circles, and many wanted the non-communist parties banned. In the end, the united front was maintained, but the possibility of the Chondoist Chongu Party conducting political activity was severely curtailed.

In 1954, the government cancelled the party&#x27;s subsidies. By 1956, approximately 1,700–3,000 members were left (out of the 10,000–50,000 remaining Ch&#x27;ŏndogyo believers). At the same time, about 200 persons were full-time employees of the party. To finance the party, it ran an iron foundry and a printing house.

In September 1957, Kim Tarhyon became a minister without portfolio.

In 1958, the party was purged again. In November of that year, sources alleged that it had, together with the Korean Social Democratic Party, conspired against the DPRK leadership. Kim Tarhyon and his closest associates were arrested. By February 1958 they had pleaded guilty, and on 16 February 1958 their parliamentary immunity was revoked. Most likely they were executed, but their exact fate remains unknown.

By this time the party had effectively ceased to function as an independent entity. No provincial organization of the party existed, just a formal central nucleus. Pak Sindok, previously the head of the Organizational Department of the party, took over the party leadership.

The Chondoist Chongu Party is sometimes invoked in North Korean propaganda targeting foreigners, but much less so than the Korean Social Democratic Party. The reason is that Ch&#x27;ŏndogyo has fallen into relative obscurity even in South Korea, while social democracy continues to be an accepted political ideology abroad.

In 1986, the former South Korean foreign minister Choe Deok-sin defected to the North, becoming a leader of the Chondoist Chongu Party.

==Recent leadership==
In 2001 and 2012, the chairwoman of the party&#x27;s central committee was Ryu Mi-yong. She was also a member of the presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly (), chairwoman of the Central Guidance Committee of the Chondoist Association of Korea (in 2010) and chairwoman of the Council for the Reunification of Tangun&#x27;s Nation (in 2012). Ryu died in November 2016, leaving the post vacant. As of 2019, the vice chairman of the party&#x27;s central committee was Ri Myong-chol. He was preceded by Yun Jong-ho. Ri is the central committee chairman.

According to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency in 2006, the party remains under the control of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea.

The party obtained 22 out of 687 seats in the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly in the 2014 election.

<text>Resistance, Rebellion, and Death (, &quot;Letters to a German Friend&quot;) is a 1960 collection of essays written by Albert Camus and selected by the author prior to his death. The essays here generally involve conflicts near the Mediterranean, with an emphasis on his home country Algeria, and on the Algerian War of Independence in particular. He also criticizes capital punishment (&quot;Reflections on the Guillotine&quot;) and totalitarianism in particular.

Camus proclaims the call to justice and the struggle for freedom also declaimed in the Old Testament, particularly the minor prophets. But he does so in a modern context, where God is silent and man is the master of his own destiny. Although he sees no messianic age, he proclaims the hope that by continuous effort, evil can be diminished and freedom and justice may become more prevalent.

Also collected here, in the essay &quot;The Artist and His Time,&quot; is the address Camus gave in December 1957 at the University of Uppsala, entitled &quot;Create Dangerously&quot;. The speech is reminiscent of Tolstoy&#x27;s essay, &quot;What is Art?&quot;, in that Camus speaks of the social context of art, concluding that &quot;the only justification [for the artist] ... is to speak up for those ... who cannot do so.&quot;</text><links>

He was the first Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the first Commissioner of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. He conducted the Royal Commission into the Finance Broking Industry in Western Australia in 2001.

==Early life and education==
Temby was educated at the Perth Modern School and the University of Western Australia, where he earned an LL.B. (Hons.), graduating in 1964.

==Career==
Temby was admitted to legal practice on 23 December 1966 and joined the Perth law firm Northmore Hale Davey and Leake in the same year. He was called to the Bar in Perth in 1978 and was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel on 16 July 1980. He was the President of the Law Society of Western Australia in 1982–1983 and the President of the Law Council of Australia in 1983–1984.

Temby served on the Subiaco City Council, including as deputy mayor from 1982 to 1983. He was the Australian Labor Party (ALP) candidate at the 1982 Nedlands state by-election, standing against future premier Richard Court.

He served as the inaugural Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions from 1984 to 1989, and as the inaugural Commissioner of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption from 1989 to 1994.

Temby has been in private practice in Sydney since 1 May 1994. He is the Founding Head of Chambers at 3 St James&#x27; Hall Chambers.

In his early days in private practice after the end of his tenure as ICAC Commissioner, Temby was appointed to represent Police Commissioner Tony Lauer at the Wood Royal Commission which looked into police corruption.

However this appointment was vetoed by Premier John Fahey due to concerns of a conflict of interest as Temby as ICAC Commissioner had the police under his investigation.

In 2004, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for service to the law, particularly in developing the role of the independent prosecutor in the Australian criminal justice system.

In 2008, he became a member of the Council of the New South Wales Bar Association. In 2009, he was the Treasurer of the Association.

In 2015, he acted for Archbishop Philip Wilson in relation to a charge of covering up child sexual abuse. In 2017, he appeared in three cases for the New South Wales Crime Commission.

<text>The Battle of Kobryń was one of the battles of the Invasion of Poland. It was fought between 14 and 18 September 1939, between the German XIX Panzer Corps of General Heinz Guderian and the improvised Polish 60th Infantry Division &quot;Kobryn&quot; of Colonel Adam Epler. It was fought concurrently with the Battle of Brześć Litewski.

== Eve of the battle ==
&quot;For a detailed description of the situation prior to the battle see: Battle of Brześć&quot;

After breaking through the Polish defences in the Battle of Wizna, the German forces under General Heinz Guderian started to make their way towards Brześć, Kowel and Kobryń. Their aim was to cut the Polish territory in two parts and paralyse the Polish attempts to organise a line of defence east of the Bug River.

== Battle ==

On 14 September 1939, elements of the XIX Panzer Corps reached the area of Brześć and Kobryń. Brześć was defended by a small force under General Konstanty Plisowski, while Kobryń was defended by the improvised 60th Infantry Division of Colonel Adam Epler.

In the early morning of 14 September Colonel Epler received a report of German forces entering the area. Elements of the German XIX Panzer Corps (elements of 3rd Panzer Division and entire 2nd Motorised Infantry Division) were advancing rapidly and Epler suspected that the Germans would advance on the towns of Brześć and Kobryń, as well as toward an important railway node located in the village of Żabinka. To probe the enemy forces, he ordered the 2nd battalion of his 84th Infantry Regiment to commence a delaying action in the area of Żabinka train station and the villages of Tewela and Ogrodniki. At the same time, the 2nd battalion of 83rd Infantry Regiment was ordered to organise a defensive line along the swampy shores of Trościanica river to cover the eastern flank of the Polish forces in the area of Brześć, some 30 kilometres westward.

On 15 September the German 3rd Armoured Division encountered and destroyed a column of the 9th reserve light artillery depot. However, Epler&#x27;s forces were not spotted until late evening of that day, when they were bombarded by the Luftwaffe. The following day the main force of the German XIX Corps arrived. The 2nd Battalion of the 84th Infantry Regiment together with an armoured train organised an ambush and attacked the Germans who were supported by a battery of artillery. Following six hours of combat, the Germans were forced to retreat with significant casualties. The Polish battalion seized several guns and tanks, but had to burn them due to lack of fuel and then retreated toward the main line of Polish defenses.

At dawn on 17 September 1939 the reconnaissance units of the German 2nd Motorised Infantry Division finally reached the Polish lines. After a short skirmish, the Poles withdrew behind the defensive positions guarded by the 2nd battalion of the 83rd Infantry Regiment. The Germans then tried to outflank the Poles by attacking the cemetery in the village of Chwedkowice, but were repelled with light losses, mostly due to direct fire from the Polish 100mm howitzers. The 2nd Motorised Division lost three or four armoured cars and was forced to retreat. The Polish battalion withdrew towards the village of Piaski, where it organised another ambush. In the afternoon it was again attacked by the elements of German 2nd Motorised Division, but this assault was also repelled.

17 September also marked the beginning of the Soviet invasion of Poland.

Overnight, the Polish forces fighting in the Battle of Brześć were withdrawn to the other side of the Bug River and joined the forces of Independent Operational Group Polesie under General Franciszek Kleeberg. Elements of the Polish forces arrived at Kobryń, but the defense of the area lost much of its strategic significance. Colonel Epler decided to defend the area as long as possible, and then retreat southwards, following the General Kleeberg&#x27;s forces.

The main battle for Kobryń began on 18 September 1939. Early in the fighting, the Germans managed to capture the Gubernia I and Gubernia II manorial farms, which were protecting the road to Bereza Kartuska and closing the approach to main forces of the Polish division. A counterattack by Polish forces from Kobryń forced the retreat of the Germans from one of the manorial farms, but it was later recaptured. Fierce combat broke out near the Queen Bona Canal. The Germans were unable to seize complete control of Kobryń on September 18 because of Polish army resistance, resulting in an impasse.

During the day, Polish patrols and units of the eastern wing of Independent Operational Group &quot;Polesie&quot; came into contact with advanced units of the Soviet Army 23rd Rifle Corps in the area of Łuniniec.

Faced with the knowledge of the broader Soviet Invasion of Poland pouring in from the frontline and specific reports from units of IOG &quot;Polesie&quot; encountering advanced units of Red Army forces, General Franciszek Kleeberg amalgamated all units of IOG &quot;Polesie&quot; under his command with the improvised 60th Infantry Division and withdrew to the South towards the Pinsk Marshes in the area of Dywin. The headquarters of GO &quot;Polesie&quot; was relocated from Pińsk to Lubieszów, at present Lubeshiv in Ukraine.

With the withdrawal of Polish forces, the battle for Kobryń came to an end.

<doc id="1236115" wikidata="Q354477" url="?curid=1236115" title="Prince Philippe, Count of Paris">
<text>Prince Philippe of Orléans, Count of Paris (Louis Philippe Albert; 24 August 1838 – 8 September 1894), was disputedly King of the French from 24 to 26 February 1848 as Louis Philippe II, although he was never officially proclaimed as such. He was the grandson of Louis Philippe I, King of the French. He was the Count of Paris as Orléanist claimant to the French throne from 1848 until his death. From 1883, when his cousin Henri, Count of Chambord died, he was often referred to by Orléanists and a large faction of Legitimists as Philippe VII.

==Early life==

Prince Philippe became the &quot;Prince Royal&quot;, heir apparent to the throne, when his father, Prince Ferdinand-Philippe, Duc d&#x27;Orléans, died in a carriage accident in 1842. Although there was some effort during the days after the abdication of his grandfather in 1848 to put him on the throne under the name of Louis-Philippe II, with his mother (Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin) as Regent, this came to nothing. They fled, and the French Second Republic was proclaimed.

==American Civil War==
A historian, journalist and outspoken democrat, Philippe volunteered to serve as a Union Army officer in the American Civil War along with his younger brother, Prince Robert, Duke of Chartres. He was appointed as an assistant adjutant general with the rank of captain on 24 September 1861 and served under the name of Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, the Count of Paris. He served on the staff of the commander of the Army of the Potomac, Major General George B. McClellan, for nearly a year. He distinguished himself during the unsuccessful Peninsular Campaign. He resigned from the Union Army, along with his brother, on 15 July 1862. Philippe&#x27;s &quot;History of the Civil War in America&quot; is considered a standard reference work on the subject.

During their stay in the United States, the princes were accompanied by their uncle, the Prince of Joinville, who painted many watercolours of their stay. On 10 November 1880 Philippe was elected as a companion of the first class (i.e. a veteran officer) of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States – an organization of Union officers who had served during the American Civil War. He was assigned insignia number 2107. His eldest son, Philippe d&#x27;Orleans, was elected as a 2nd class member (i.e. an eldest son of a veteran officer) in 1890 and succeeded to first class membership in the Order upon Philippe&#x27;s death.

==Marriage and issue==
On 30 May 1864 at St. Raphael&#x27;s Church in Kingston upon Thames, England he married his paternal first cousin, Princess Marie Isabelle d&#x27;Orléans (1848–1919), Infanta of Spain. She was daughter of Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain and Prince Antoine, Duke of Montpensier (1824–1890), the youngest son of Louis-Philippe of France and Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily. They had eight children:

*Princess Amélie d&#x27;Orléans (1865–1951); married Carlos I of Portugal in 1886.
*Prince Louis &quot;Philippe&quot; Robert d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Orléans (1869–1926); married Archduchess Maria Dorothea of Austria, daughter of Archduke Joseph Karl of Austria in 1896,
*Princess Hélène of Orléans (1871–1951); married Emmanuel Philibert, 2nd Duke of Aosta in 1895.
*Prince Charles d&#x27;Orléans (1875–1875).
*Princess Isabelle d&#x27;Orléans (1878–1961); married Prince Jean D&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Guise in 1899.
*Prince Jacques d&#x27;Orléans (1880–1881).
*Princess Louise d&#x27;Orléans (1882–1958); married Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies in 1907. Through her daughter, Maria Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, she was the grandmother of King Juan Carlos I of Spain.
*Prince Ferdinand d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Montpensier (1884–1924); married Marie Isabelle Gonzales de Olañeta y Ibaretta, Marchioness of Valdeterrazo in 1921.

==Restoration of French monarchy==
The Orleans family had been in exile in England since the Revolution of 1848 which toppled King Louis Philippe. During their early married life, the Count and Countess of Paris lived at York House, Twickenham. However, in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War and the downfall of Napoleon III, they were allowed to return to France, and many of their properties were restored to them. In 1873, anticipating a restoration of the monarchy by the largely monarchist National Assembly that had been elected following the fall of Napoleon III, the Count of Paris withdrew his claims to the defunct French throne in favour of the legitimist claimant, Henri V, best known as the &quot;Comte de Chambord&quot;. It was assumed by most that the Count of Paris was Chambord&#x27;s heir-presumptive, and would thus be able to succeed to the throne upon the childless Chambord&#x27;s death, reuniting the two claims that had divided French monarchists since 1830. However, Chambord&#x27;s refusal to recognize the tricolor as the French flag sabotaged hopes of a restoration, and Chambord died in 1883 without ever specifically recognizing his Orléanist rival as his heir-presumptive.

Upon the Count of Chambord&#x27;s death, the Count of Paris was recognized by most monarchists as Philippe VII of France. This succession was disputed by the Carlist descendants of the Bourbon kings of Spain, who argued that being descended directly from Louis XIV their claim was greater than that of the Orléanists&#x27;; however, this argument pointedly ignored Philip V of Spain&#x27;s renunciation of his and his descendants&#x27; claim to the French throne pursuant to the Treaty of Utrecht.

In 1886 the family was exiled again returning to the United Kingdom, where they first lived at Sheen House, near Richmond, where the young Rosa Lewis was a member of their household. In 1890 they moved to the much grander Stowe House, where he died in 1894. He was succeeded as claimant to the defunct French throne by his son Prince Philippe.

<text>In Unix-like computer operating systems, a pipeline is a mechanism for inter-process communication using message passing. A pipeline is a set of processes chained together by their standard streams, so that the output text of each process (&quot;stdout&quot;) is passed directly as input (&quot;stdin&quot;) to the next one. The second process is started as the first process is still executing, and they are executed concurrently.

The concept of pipelines was championed by Douglas McIlroy at Unix&#x27;s ancestral home of Bell Labs, during the development of Unix, shaping its toolbox philosophy. It is named by analogy to a physical pipeline. A key feature of these pipelines is their &quot;hiding of internals&quot;. This in turn allows for more clarity and simplicity in the system.

The pipes in the pipeline are anonymous pipes (as opposed to named pipes), where data written by one process is buffered by the operating system until it is read by the next process, and this uni-directional channel disappears when the processes are completed. The standard shell syntax for anonymous pipes is to list multiple commands, separated by vertical bars (&quot;pipes&quot; in common Unix verbiage).

==History==
The pipeline concept was invented by Douglas McIlroy and first described in the man pages of Version 3 Unix. McIlroy noticed that much of the time command shells passed the output file from one program as input to another. The concept of pipelines was championed by Douglas McIlroy at Unix&#x27;s ancestral home of Bell Labs, during the development of Unix, shaping its toolbox philosophy.

His ideas were implemented in 1973 when (&quot;in one feverish night&quot;, wrote McIlroy) Ken Thompson added the codice_1 system call and pipes to the shell and several utilities in Version 3 Unix. &quot;The next day&quot;, McIlroy continued, &quot;saw an unforgettable orgy of one-liners as everybody joined in the excitement of plumbing.&quot; McIlroy also credits Thompson with the codice_2 notation, which greatly simplified the description of pipe syntax in Version 4.

Although developed independently, Unix pipes are related to, and were preceded by, the &#x27;communication files&#x27; developed by Ken Lochner in the 1960s for the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System.

===Other operating systems===
This feature of Unix was borrowed by other operating systems, such as MS-DOS and the CMS Pipelines package on VM/CMS and MVS, and eventually came to be designated the pipes and filters design pattern of software engineering.

=== Further concept development ===
In Tony Hoare&#x27;s communicating sequential processes (CSP), McIlroy&#x27;s pipes are further developed.

==Implementation==
A pipeline mechanism is used for inter-process communication using message passing. A pipeline is a set of processes chained together by their standard streams, so that the output text of each process (&quot;stdout&quot;) is passed directly as input (&quot;stdin&quot;) to the next one. The second process is started as the first process is still executing, and they are executed concurrently. It is named by analogy to a physical pipeline. A key feature of these pipelines is their &quot;hiding of internals&quot;. This in turn allows for more clarity and simplicity in the system.

In most Unix-like systems, all processes of a pipeline are started at the same time, with their streams appropriately connected, and managed by the scheduler together with all other processes running on the machine. An important aspect of this, setting Unix pipes apart from other pipe implementations, is the concept of buffering: for example a sending program may produce 5000 bytes per second, and a receiving program may only be able to accept 100 bytes per second, but no data is lost. Instead, the output of the sending program is held in the buffer. When the receiving program is ready to read data, the next program in the pipeline reads from the buffer. If the buffer is filled, the sending program is stopped (blocked) until at least some data is removed from the buffer by the receiver. In Linux, the size of the buffer is 65,536 bytes (64KiB). An open source third-party filter called bfr is available to provide larger buffers if required.

===Network pipes===
Tools like netcat and socat can connect pipes to TCP/IP sockets.

== Pipelines in command line interfaces ==

All widely used Unix shells have a special syntax construct for the creation of pipelines. In all usage one writes the commands in sequence, separated by the ASCII vertical bar character codice_2 (which, for this reason, is often called &quot;pipe character&quot;). The shell starts the processes and arranges for the necessary connections between their standard streams (including some amount of buffer storage).

The pipeline uses anonymous pipes. For anonymous pipes, data written by one process is buffered by the operating system until it is read by the next process, and this uni-directional channel disappears when the processes are completed; this differs from named pipes, where messages are passed to or from a pipe that is named by making it a file, and remains after the processes are completed. The standard shell syntax for anonymous pipes is to list multiple commands, separated by vertical bars (&quot;pipes&quot; in common Unix verbiage): command1 | command2 | command3

For example, to list files in the current directory (), retain only the lines of output containing the string (), and view the result in a scrolling page (), a user types the following into the command line of a terminal:

ls -l | grep key | less

The command codice_4 is executed as a process, the output (stdout) of which is piped to the input (stdin) of the process for codice_5; and likewise for the process for codice_6. Each process takes input from the previous process and produces output for the next process via &quot;standard streams&quot;. Each codice_2 tells the shell to connect the standard output of the command on the left to the standard input of the command on the right by an inter-process communication mechanism called an (anonymous) pipe, implemented in the operating system. Pipes are unidirectional; data flows through the pipeline from left to right.

=== Example ===
Below is an example of a pipeline that implements a kind of spell checker for the web resource indicated by a URL. An explanation of what it does follows.
curl &#x27;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)&#x27; |
sed &#x27;s/[^a-zA-Z ]/ /g&#x27; |
tr &#x27;A-Z &#x27; &#x27;a-z\n&#x27; |
grep &#x27;[a-z]&#x27; |
sort -u |
comm -23 - &lt;(sort /usr/share/dict/words) |
less
# codice_8 obtains the HTML contents of a web page (could use codice_9 on some systems).
# codice_10 replaces all characters (from the web page&#x27;s content) that are not spaces or letters, with spaces. (Newlines are preserved.)
# codice_11 changes all of the uppercase letters into lowercase and converts the spaces in the lines of text to newlines (each &#x27;word&#x27; is now on a separate line).
# codice_12 includes only lines that contain at least one lowercase alphabetical character (removing any blank lines).
# codice_13 sorts the list of &#x27;words&#x27; into alphabetical order, and the codice_14 switch removes duplicates.
# codice_15 finds lines in common between two files, codice_16 suppresses lines unique to the second file, and those that are common to both, leaving only those that are found only in the first file named. The codice_17 in place of a filename causes codice_18 to use its standard input (from the pipe line in this case). codice_19 sorts the contents of the codice_20 file alphabetically, as codice_18 expects, and codice_22 outputs the results to a temporary file (via process substitution), which codice_18 reads. The result is a list of words (lines) that are not found in /usr/share/dict/words.
# codice_24 allows the user to page through the results.

===Error stream===
By default, the standard error streams (&quot;stderr&quot;) of the processes in a pipeline are not passed on through the pipe; instead, they are merged and directed to the console. However, many shells have additional syntax for changing this behavior. In the csh shell, for instance, using codice_25 instead of codice_2 signifies that the standard error stream should also be merged with the standard output and fed to the next process. The Bash shell can also merge standard error with codice_25 since version 4.0 or using codice_28, as well as redirect it to a different file.

===Pipemill===

In the most commonly used simple pipelines the shell connects a series of sub-processes via pipes, and executes external commands within each sub-process. Thus the shell itself is doing no direct processing of the data flowing through the pipeline.

However, it&#x27;s possible for the shell to perform processing directly, using a so-called mill or pipemill (since a codice_29 command is used to &quot;mill&quot; over the results from the initial command). This construct generally looks something like:

command | while read -r var1 var2 ...; do
 # process each line, using variables as parsed into var1, var2, etc
 # (note that this may be a subshell: var1, var2 etc will not be available
 # after the while loop terminates; some shells, such as zsh and newer
 # versions of Korn shell, process the commands to the left of the pipe
 # operator in a subshell)
 done
Such pipemill may not perform as intended if the body of the loop includes commands, such as codice_30 and codice_31, that read from codice_32: on the loop&#x27;s first iteration, such a program (let&#x27;s call it &quot;the drain&quot;) will read the remaining output from codice_33, and the loop will then terminate (with results depending on the specifics of the drain). There are a couple of possible ways to avoid this behavior. First, some drains support an option to disable reading from codice_34 (e.g. codice_35). Alternatively, if the drain does not &quot;need&quot; to read any input from codice_34 to do something useful, it can be given codice_37 as input.

As all components of a pipe are run in parallel, a shell typically forks a subprocess (a subshell) to handle its contents, making it impossible to propagate variable changes to the outside shell environment. To remedy this issue, the &quot;pipemill&quot; can instead be fed from a here document containing a command substitution, which waits for the pipeline to finish running before milling through the contents. Alternatively, a named pipe or a process substitution can be used for parallel execution. GNU bash also has a option to disable forking for the last pipe component.

==Creating pipelines programmatically==
Pipelines can be created under program control. The Unix codice_1 system call asks the operating system to construct a new anonymous pipe object. This results in two new, opened file descriptors in the process: the read-only end of the pipe, and the write-only end. The pipe ends appear to be normal, anonymous file descriptors, except that they have no ability to seek.

To avoid deadlock and exploit parallelism, the Unix process with one or more new pipes will then, generally, call codice_39 to create new processes. Each process will then close the end(s) of the pipe that it will not be using before producing or consuming any data. Alternatively, a process might create new threads and use the pipe to communicate between them.

&quot;Named pipes&quot; may also be created using codice_40 or codice_41 and then presented as the input or output file to programs as they are invoked. They allow multi-path pipes to be created, and are especially effective when combined with standard error redirection, or with codice_42.

== Popular culture ==

The robot in the icon for Apple&#x27;s Automator, which also uses a pipeline concept to chain repetitive commands together, holds a pipe in homage to the original Unix concept.

<doc id="1236122" wikidata="Q123166" url="?curid=1236122" title="Gettysburg (1993 film)">
<text>Gettysburg is a 1993 American epic war film about the Battle of Gettysburg in the American Civil War. Written and directed by Ronald F. Maxwell, the film was adapted from the 1974 historical novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; by Michael Shaara. It features an ensemble cast, including Tom Berenger as James Longstreet, Jeff Daniels as Joshua Chamberlain, Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee, Stephen Lang as George Pickett, and Sam Elliott as John Buford.

Originally filmed as a miniseries for TNT, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; received a limited theatrical release from New Line Cinema under the direction of Ted Turner, who owned both entities. At 254 minutes (4 hours and 14 minutes), it is the longest film released theatrically by a major film studio in the United States. It received positive reviews from critics, but grossed only $12.7 million on a $20 million budget. It was however considered a hit regardless, due to its immediate TNT premiere ratings success, and subsequent home video sales. A prequel entitled &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; was released in 2003, also directed by Maxwell and featuring many returning cast members.

==Plot==
The film begins with a narrated map showing the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by Robert E. Lee, crossing the Potomac River to invade the North in June 1863, marching across Maryland and into Pennsylvania. On June 30, Confederate spy Henry Thomas Harrison reports to Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, commander of the First Corps, that the Union Army of the Potomac is moving in their direction, and that Union commander Joseph Hooker has been replaced by George Meade. Longstreet reports the information to General Lee, who is concerned that the army is moving &quot;on the word of an actor&quot;, as opposed to that of his cavalry chief, J. E. B. Stuart. Nonetheless, Lee orders the army to concentrate near the town of Gettysburg. At the Union encampments near Union Mills, Maryland, Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain of the 20th Maine is ordered to take in 120 men from the disbanded 2nd Maine who had resigned in protest, with permission to shoot any man who refuses to fight. Chamberlain speaks to the men, and is able to persuade all but six to take up arms.

In Gettysburg, Brig. Gen. John Buford and his cavalry division spot elements of Henry Heth&#x27;s division of A. P. Hill&#x27;s Third Corps approaching the town and recognizes that the main body of the Confederate army is approaching. Buford recognizes that, with precedent from previous battles, the Confederates will arrive at Gettysburg first and entrench in strong positions, forcing the Union to charge them and suffer heavy casualties. To prevent this, he opts to stand and fight where he is, judging the terrain to be &quot;lovely ground&quot; for slowing the Confederate advance. Buford sends word to I Corps commander Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds to bring up reinforcements. Heth&#x27;s troops engage Buford&#x27;s cavalry the following morning, July 1, with Richard S. Ewell&#x27;s Second Corps moving in to flank them. Reynolds brings his corps forward, but is killed by a Confederate sharpshooter. The Union army is pushed out of Gettysburg to Cemetery Ridge, and Lee—rejecting Longstreet&#x27;s suggestion to redeploy south of Gettysburg and go on the defensive—orders Ewell to take the Union position &quot;if practicable&quot;. However, Ewell hesitates and does not engage. The armies concentrate at their chosen positions for the remainder of the first day. At Confederate headquarters at Seminary Ridge, Maj. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble angrily denounces Ewell&#x27;s inaction to Lee, and requests another assignment.

On the second day, July 2, Col. Strong Vincent&#x27;s brigade from the Union V Corps is deployed to Little Round Top, and Vincent places the 20th Maine at the end of the line, warning Chamberlain that he and his regiment are the flank, and that if they retreat, the Confederate army can swing around behind them and rout the Union forces. Chamberlain speaks to the six remaining men of the 2nd Maine, and three of them decide to fight. Lee orders Longstreet to deploy his two available divisions to take Little Round Top and the neighboring Big Round Top. As Longstreet&#x27;s corps deploys, Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood, commanding one of the divisions, protests to Longstreet; with the Union holding the high ground, he would lose half his forces if he attacked as ordered. Longstreet, despite his own protests to Lee, orders Hood to attack; Hood is later wounded fighting at Devil&#x27;s Den. At the summit of Little Round Top, Chamberlain and the 20th Maine fight off wave after wave of advancing Confederates, and begin running out of ammunition. Colonel Vincent is mortally wounded, and none of the other three regiments in his brigade are able to provide support. Chamberlain orders his men to fix bayonets, and charge in a right wheel down the slope against the attacking Confederates, which Chamberlain describes as &quot;we&#x27;ll swing it down; we swing like a door.&quot; The attack successfully drives the Confederate assault back, and the Union flank holds. That evening, Stuart finally arrives, and Lee reprimands him for his being out of contact. At the same time, Longstreet&#x27;s remaining division, under Maj. Gen. George Pickett, arrives on the field.

For the third day, July 3, Lee decides to send three divisions—Pickett&#x27;s, Trimble&#x27;s, and J. Johnston Pettigrew&#x27;s—to attack the center of the Union line at Cemetery Ridge. Longstreet expresses his belief to Lee that the attack will fail, as the movement is a mile over open ground, and that the Union II Corps under Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock is deployed behind a stone wall, just as Longstreet&#x27;s men had been at Fredericksburg. Lee nonetheless orders the attack to proceed. Longstreet then meets with the three division commanders and details the plan, beginning first with Colonel Edward Porter Alexander&#x27;s artillery clearing the Union guns off the ridge, before deploying the men forward. Despite heavy Confederate fire, Alexander is unable to make an impact upon the Union guns. When Pickett asks to move forward, Longstreet simply nods. The Confederate divisions march across the open field, and Hancock is wounded as he commands from the front line. One of Pickett&#x27;s brigades, commanded by Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead, makes it over the stone wall, but Armistead is wounded and captured by Union troops. The Confederates retreat due to high casualties. Seeing a despondent General Pickett, General Lee implores him to &quot;look to your division,&quot; to which Pickett replies &quot;General Lee, I have no division.&quot; Pickett&#x27;s Charge ultimately fails. Meeting with Longstreet that evening, Lee finally decides that they will withdraw. The film ends with the fates of the major figures of the battle.

==Production==
Reeves Teletape Studios first acquired the rights for an adaptation of &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; in 1978. In 1981, Ronald F. Maxwell acquired the rights to the property and hired Michael Sharaa to write a screenplay adaptation. Although Sharaa died in 1988, Maxwell completed the 400-page screenplay. PolyGram Pictures agreed to produce the project as a film starring Robert Duvall and William Hurt but went bankrupt shortly afterwards. Maxwell was unable to sell the project to any other studio because of the failures of recent historical epics such as &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot;. Kevin Costner was interested in adapting the film but chose instead to direct &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;.

Although Maxwell was displeased with American Civil War television series such as &quot;North and South&quot; and &quot;The Blue and the Gray&quot;, he reluctantly decided to try to release the project as a television series. The producers originally pitched the project to ABC in 1991, as a TV miniseries. ABC initially agreed to back the project, but when a miniseries about George Armstrong Custer, &quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot; (1991), got low ratings and after the Gulf War started, ABC pulled out. Maxwell, with help from documentarian Ken Burns, finally secured funding for the film from Ted Turner at the 3rd Golden Laurel Awards in 1991. Originally it was planned as a miniseries for Turner Network Television, but it was released as a film instead.

Duvall decided against starring as Robert E. Lee in order to appear in &quot;Stalin&quot;, while Albert Finney and George C. Scott declined the role.

Russell Crowe, then an unknown to the US film industry, was favored by the director for the role of Joshua Chamberlain but he was eventually passed over in favor of Jeff Daniels.

For the first time, the National Park Service allowed the motion picture industry to recreate and film battle scenes directly on the Gettysburg Battlefield, including scenes of Devil&#x27;s Den and Little Round Top. However, much of the movie was shot at a nearby Adams County farm. Thousands of Civil War reenactors from across the country volunteered their time to come to Gettysburg to participate in the massive battle scenes.

The score was composed by Randy Edelman.

During filming of the battle scenes on Little Round Top, Bradley Egen, an extra playing a Union soldier, was unintentionally struck in the head by the butt of a musket and suffered a mild concussion, however Bradley was able to resume light duties the following day.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack was composed by Randy Edelman and issued on Milan Records.

Two more soundtracks, &quot;More Songs and Music From Gettysburg&quot; and a &quot;Deluxe Commemorative Edition&quot;, were released as well. The first one included popular songs from the time period and a recitation of the Gettysburg Address by Jeff Daniels, while the second featured the original soundtrack album (above) and a second disc several previously unreleased tracks from the score and the aforementioned recitation. Another score &quot;Armistead is hit&quot; which played when Armistead rallies the division was never released in the soundtrack.

==Release==
The miniseries was set to air on TNT, but when Ted Turner saw part of the film during post-production, he realized it was much bigger than a miniseries and decided to release the film theatrically. The film was distributed by New Line Cinema which Turner had just acquired. Only released to 248 theaters at its widest release and limited to just one or two showings per day because of its length, the film still managed to gross $12,769,960 at the box office. It would go on to become an all-time high seller on the VHS and DVD market, and has become a staple of classroom history lessons. Its June 1994 broadcast TV premiere, on TNT, garnered over 34 million viewers, a record for cable TV.

One of the longest films ever released by a Hollywood studio, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; runs 254 minutes (4 hours, 14 minutes) on VHS and DVD. A &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, 271-minute (4 hours, 31 minutes), with several extended or added scenes, was produced and sold as a part of a special &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2011, to coincide with 150th commemoration of beginning of the Civil War in April 1861. It was also released in the UK by the Premium Collection as a DVD and Blu-ray combo which includes the Directors extended version and is number 21 in the collection.

===Reception===
&quot;Gettysburg&quot; received a 77% &quot;Fresh&quot; score with an average rating of 7.3/10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 22 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Gettysburg&quot;″s reverent approach to history is balanced with the committed work of a talented cast - and the hard-hitting dramatization of a bloody turning point in the Civil War.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, stating, &quot;This is a film that Civil War buffs will find indispensable, even if others might find it interminable.&quot; Ebert said that despite his initial indifference, he left the film with a new understanding of the Civil War, and that he felt Jeff Daniels deserved an Oscar nomination for his performance. Ebert also gave the film a &quot;thumbs-up&quot; on &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, while Gene Siskel gave it a &quot;thumbs-down&quot;, saying the film was &quot;bloated Southern propaganda&quot;. He, however, also praised Daniels&#x27;s performance and recommended his nomination for an Oscar.

===Accolades===
==Prequel==
&quot;Gods and Generals&quot;, a prequel based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Jeff Shaara (Michael Shaara&#x27;s son), was released in 2003. It was also written and directed by Ronald F. Maxwell and featured many returning cast members, including Jeff Daniels as Joshua Chamberlain, Kevin Conway as Buster Kilrain, and C. Thomas Howell as Thomas Chamberlain. Stephen Lang, who portrayed George Pickett in the first film, also returned, but in the role of Stonewall Jackson after scheduling conflicts prevented Russell Crowe from taking the part. Billy Campbell, who portrayed Andrew Lewis Pitzer in &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, replaced Lang as Pickett. New cast members included Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee, replacing Martin Sheen.

The film received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure, grossing $12.8 million on a $56 million budget.

==Unproduced sequel==
Originally intended to form part of a trilogy, a third film to be titled &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot; presenting the end of the American Civil War was proposed, but it never went beyond the planning stage.

<text>Sir Leonard George Holden Huxley (29 May 1902 – 4 September 1988) was an Australian physicist.

Huxley was born in London, the eldest son of George Hamborough and Lilian Huxley. He was a second-cousin once removed of Thomas Huxley. His family migrated from England to Australia in 1905 when he was three, and settled in Tasmania, where Huxley showed great academic and sporting promise while attending The Hutchins School. He won a Rhodes Scholarship to New College, Oxford while in his second year at the University of Tasmania and obtained a D.Phil. from Oxford in 1928. On 5 October 1929 he married Ella Mary Child &#x27;Molly&#x27; Copeland who was reading history at Somerville College.

Huxley was a physicist at the Australian Radio Research Board, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research 1929 to 1931; Lecturer in Physics, University College, Leicester 1932 to 1940; Principal Scientific Officer, Ministry of Aircraft Production, UK 1940 to 1946; Reader in Electromagnetism, University of Birmingham 1946 to 1949; Professor of Physics, University of Adelaide 1949 to 1960; and Vice-Chancellor, Australian National University 1960 to 1967.

Huxley was president of the Australian Branch of the Institute of Physics (UK) 1954 to 1955; and president of the Australian Institute of Physics 1962 to 1965.

He was elected a Foundation Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 1953, and knighted in 1964.

Huxley died in London at the age of 86.

<doc id="1236132" wikidata="Q6730455" url="?curid=1236132" title="Magi-Nation Duel">
<text>Magi-Nation Duel, sometimes abbreviated &quot;MND&quot; or simply Magi-Nation, is an out-of-print collectible card game (CCG) published by Interactive Imagination Corp (2i) in October 2000. 

==History and development==
MND was previewed at Gen Con 2000 and was released in October 2000. Lead Designer and Co-Founder of 2i Phillip Tavel created a game with mechanics which resembled and were partially based on , while much of the flavor of the game was based on the anime-style artwork of Matt Holmberg. Greg Richardson Von Oy (the other original Co-Founder of 2i) and Josh Lytle (a former professional gamer) helped to playtest and finalize the original design of the game. Several manga-style American artists led by Art Director: Thomas Cook include Matt Holmberg, Rich Werner (Main character designer for Kybar&#x27;s Teeth, Weave, Paradwyn, Bograth, Nar and The Sands of Dresh), Tim Gillette, Chana Goodman, and Ryan Shreve helped to expand the universe of art based on the original creations of Matt Holmberg. The game was originally designed as a bridge between Pokémon and . The idea was that younger players whose first game was Pokémon would eventually seek out a new game to play and that Magic: The Gathering might be too complex for some players, leaving a void in the market between the two massively popular card games. The game is now out of print. A new version of the game, licensed by Cookie Jar, was to be released in 2008, but no relaunch ever surfaced.

The game had an active following which later released a number of cards 2i had in development, as well as a number of fan cards. These cards were previously found at CCGWorkshop, however as of January 2008, they no longer available as 2i had requested their removal.

==Expansions==

The first card set, which is also known as &quot;Limited&quot;, contained 190 cards and introduced five &quot;regions&quot; of the larger world called the &quot;Moonlands&quot;: Arderial, Cald, Naroom, Orothe, and Underneath. A reprint of the base set, known as &quot;Unlimited&quot;, was released in February 2001. This set contained a full parallel set of &quot;foil&quot; premium cards, whereas the base set only had foil versions of selected cards.

Four additional sets were created as expansions to the game, designed by Dan Tibbles and Stephen McLaughlin:

*&quot;Awakening&quot; (142 cards, released May 2001)
*&quot;Dream&#x27;s End&quot; (185 cards, released November 2001)
*&quot;Nightmare&#x27;s Dawn&quot; (300 cards, released April 2002)
*&quot;Voice of the Storms&quot; (300 cards, released November 2002)

==Other media==

In an attempt to popularize the brand, 2i also developed a Game Boy Color role-playing video game cartridge, titled &quot;Magi Nation&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Magi Nation: Invasion&quot;, was in development for the Game Boy Advance (GBA), but production ceased for an undisclosed reason. 

&quot;Magi Nation: Keeper&#x27;s Quest&quot; is a puzzle game, produced originally for the Game Boy Color, but never released on that platform. Instead, it was released for Palm PDAs and Verizon and Handango cell phones.

===Animation===
The licensing agreement to produce the Magi-Nation animated series was finalized in September 2005 with a multinational studio. In October 2006, Cookie Jar Entertainment confirmed production of its animated adaptation of the Magi-Nation series. In February 2007, it was officially announced that Cookie Jar Entertainment&#x27;s Magi-Nation had been picked up by Kids WB! in the United States and by CBC in Canada. There was an initial production run of 26 episodes. The series was a Canada-Korea co-production.

<doc id="1236133" wikidata="Q384501" url="?curid=1236133" title="Stanley Morison">
<text>Stanley Arthur Morison (6 May 1889 – 11 October 1967) was a British typographer, printing executive and historian of printing. Largely self-educated, he promoted higher standards in printing and an awareness of the best printing and typefaces of the past.

From the 1920s Morison became an influential adviser to the British Monotype Corporation, advising them on type design. His strong aesthetic sense was a force within the company, which starting shortly before his joining became increasingly known for commissioning popular, historically influenced designs that revived some of the best typefaces of the past, with particular attention to the middle period of printing from the Renaissance to the late eighteenth century, and creating and licensing several new type designs that would become popular. Original typefaces commissioned under Morison&#x27;s involvement included Times New Roman, Gill Sans and Perpetua, while revivals of older designs included Bembo, Ehrhardt and Bell. Times New Roman, the development of which Morison led to the point that he felt he could consider it his own design, has become one of the most used typefaces of all time. Becoming closely connected to &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper as an advisor on printing, he became part of its management and the editor of the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; after the war, and late in life joined the editorial board of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Stanley Morison was born on 6 May 1889, at Wanstead, Essex, but spent most of his childhood and early adult years (1896–1912) in London at the family home in Fairfax Road, Harringay. He was self-taught, having left school after his father abandoned his family.

In 1913 Morison became an editorial assistant on &quot;The Imprint&quot; magazine.

Morison was one of the founders of The Guild of the Pope&#x27;s Peace, an organization created to promote Pope Benedict XV&#x27;s calls for peace in the face of the First World War.

On the imposition of conscription in 1916 during First World War, he was a conscientious objector, and was imprisoned. Like his friend Eric Gill, Morison was a convert to Catholicism, distancing him from many of his later colleagues. Morison married Mabel Williamson, a teacher, in 1916; the marriage was an unhappy one and Morison rapidly separated from his wife.

In 1918 he became design supervisor at the Pelican Press, which published material critical of the war. He moved on to a similar position at the Cloister Press. In 1922, he was a founder-member of the Fleuron Society dedicated to typographic matters (a fleuron being a typographic flower or ornament). He edited the society&#x27;s journal, &quot;The Fleuron&quot;, from 1925 to 1930. The quality of the publication&#x27;s artwork and printing was considered exceptional. From 1923 to 1925, he was also a staff editor/writer for the &quot;Penrose Annual,&quot; a graphic arts journal.

==With the Monotype Corporation==
From 1923 to 1967, Morison was a typographic consultant for the Monotype Corporation. In the 1920s and 1930s, his work at Monotype included research and adaptation of historical typefaces, including the revival of the Bembo and Bell types. He pioneered the great expansion of the company&#x27;s range of typefaces, and hugely influenced the field of typography to the present day. At Monotype, Morison obtained rights to typefaces by leading artists of the time including Bruce Rogers, Jan van Krimpen and Berthold Wolpe. Aesthetically, Morison disliked the excessive historicity of Victorian romantic fine printing, with its interest in reviving blackletter and the appearance of medieval manuscripts, but preferred a more restrained style of printing that nonetheless also rejected the harshly industrial appearance of the &quot;batteries of bold, bad faces&quot; of the nineteenth century.

In 1927, the British Monotype Corporation hired Beatrice Warde – quickly named the company&#x27;s Publicity Manager – and has been credited with spreading Morison&#x27;s typographic influences through her own writings. Morison and Warde helped edit Monotype&#x27;s newsletter, the &quot;Monotype Recorder&quot;, which promoted Monotype equipment and provided tips for users, showcased examples of high-quality printing and included articles on printing history, several by Morison&#x27;s collaborator Alfred F. Johnson, a curator at the British Museum. Through Daniel Berkeley Updike, the leading figure in American printing of the time with whom he carried an extensive correspondence, he became aware of an obscure late-eighteenth century type known as Bell in the archives of Sheffield type foundry Stephenson Blake, and arranged for Monotype to license and recreate it. While not all his projects at Monotype were successful and his position was insecure at the start of his tenure, his commission of Gill Sans and even more so Times New Roman both proved extremely financially successful for Monotype. Both remain among the most-used typefaces of all time.

Morison became friends with Brooke Crutchley, printer to the University of Cambridge, one of Monotype&#x27;s best customers, and his archives went to Cambridge after his death. Late in life, for Crutchley he wrote the book &quot;A Tally of Types&quot;, an assessment of the typefaces created by Monotype that were used in Cambridge. Despite its limited scope and some oversights, it is considered one of the landmark books on twentieth-century printing.

As a writer for the &quot;Fleuron&quot; he was known for promoting the radical idea that italics in book printing were too disruptive to the flow of text, and should be phased out. While this influenced some contemporary type designers such as van Krimpen and Dwiggins at Linotype, Morison rapidly came to concede that the idea was misguided, and late in life commented that Times New Roman included an italic that &quot;owed more to Didot than dogma.&quot;

Morison wrote prolifically on the history of printing. Philip Gaskell however cautioned that &quot;his books and papers were always stimulating, and frequently sound in their general conclusions, but at the same time he was inaccurate&quot;.

==Times New Roman==
Morison was also typographical consultant to &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper from 1929 to 1960; and in 1931, having criticised the paper for the poor quality of its printing, he was commissioned by the newspaper to produce a new, easy-to-read typeface for the publication. &quot;Times New Roman,&quot; the typeface which Morison developed with graphic artist Victor Lardent, was first used by the newspaper in 1932 and was issued commercially by Monotype in 1933. 

He held the held the Sandars Readership in Bibliography at Cambridge in 1931 and lectured on &quot;The English newspaper: some account of the physical development of the journals printed in London from 1622 down to the present day.&quot;

Morison edited the &quot;History of the Times&quot; from 1935 to 1952, and was editor of &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; between 1945 and 1948.

==Later career==

Morison was Lyell Lecturer in Bibliography at the University of Oxford in 1956-1957 and lectured on &quot;Aspects of Authority and Freedom in Relation to Greco–Latin Script, Inscription, and Type.&quot;

In 1960, Morison was elected a Royal Designer for Industry. He was a member of the editorial board of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; from 1961 until his death in 1967. He was offered a knighthood in 1953 and the CBE in 1962, but declined both.

He was instrumental in development of the exhibition of the contribution printing had made to the enlargement of human knowledge: Printing and the Mind of Man. It coincided with the 1963 International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition (IPEX).

Morison died in London on 11 October 1967.

<text>Maurice Rose (May 26, 1906 – January 1, 1981) was an American racing driver. He won the Indianapolis 500 in 1941, 1947, and 1948, becoming the race&#x27;s third three-time winner. He also won the AAA National Championship in 1936.

== Racing career ==

=== Indianapolis 500 career ===

Although Rose had driven in every Indianapolis 500 since 1933, he earned his first pole position when he put his Maserati on the pole for the 1941 Indianapolis 500; but spark plug problems sidelined his car after sixty laps. He then took over the Wetteroth/Offenhauser car being driven by Floyd Davis that had started in 17th place. Rose went on to win. In 1947 and 1948, Rose captured back-to-back Indianapolis 500s driving one of the Diedt/Offenhauser Blue Crown Spark Plug Specials, owned and prepared by veteran driver/car owner Lou Moore.

Late in the 1947 race, Rose found himself lying second to his rookie teammate, Bill Holland, when both were given a sign reading &quot;EZY&quot; from pit lane. Holland reduced speed, but Rose ignored the sign and continued on. Rose closed on Holland and to his amazement, Holland gave way without a battle and even gave Rose a friendly wave as he went past on his way to victory. But Holland thought he had more than a lap lead on Rose, instead of just a few seconds. Holland was furious afterward.

In 1949, with Holland leading and Rose again running second late in the race, Rose set out to overtake his now-veteran teammate. Rose again ignored car owner Lou Moore&#x27;s &quot;EZ&quot; signs from the pits and continued to push in pursuit of Holland. This time, Rose&#x27;s car broke while Holland cruised home to victory—and Moore fired Rose on the spot after the race for disobeying team orders.

Rose made his fifteenth and final Indianapolis 500 start in the 1951 race. Knocked out from an accident after 126 laps, the forty-five-year-old Rose retired to a home in California. For the 1967 race, officials of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway invited him to drive the pace car.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Rose participated in two World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. He finished in the top three once, and scored four World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

== Post-racing career and life ==

Rose worked for General Motors both during and after his racing career. He was heavily involved in the development of the Chevrolet Corvette into a competitive racing machine.

Both of Rose&#x27;s children were disabled by polio. While his career in racing was filled with success, he considered his most important accomplishment to be his invention of a device that made it possible for those without the use of their legs to drive an automobile.

== Awards and honors ==

Rose has been inducted into the following halls of fame:
* Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1967)
* Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (1972)
* Michigan Motor Sports Hall of Fame (1982)
* Eastern Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame (1989)
* International Motorsports Hall of Fame (1994)
* Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (1996)
* International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame (2007)

Rose has been awarded the following honors:
* Automotive Hall of Fame Distinguished Service Citation (1966)

<text>David Elphinstone (15 January 1846– 9 May 1916) was an Australian architect and builder. Elphinstone built many buildings in Glebe, New South Wales and Ashfield, New South Wales at the end of the 19th century.

==Biography==
A member of a family of architects and builders, David Elphinstone was the son of William and Janet (nee Leckie) Elphinstone.

Elphinstone joined the building industry in 1868 as a carpenter under the tutelage of his father. He was first listed as a builder in Glebe in 1873 and served as a local alderman from 1881 to 1886.

By 1879, he had become an architect and builder. His development of the Saint Philip&#x27;s Church lands in Glebe made him Glebe&#x27;s largest building contractor.

His son, David Bruce Elphinstone (born 1880), also became an architect.

<text>Operation Althea, formally the European Union Force Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR), is a military deployment in Bosnia and Herzegovina to oversee the military implementation of the Dayton Agreement. It is the successor to NATO&#x27;s SFOR and IFOR. The transition from SFOR to EUFOR was largely a change of name and commanders: 80% of the troops remained in place. It replaced SFOR on 2 December 2004.

==General aspects==
Civilian implementation of the Dayton Agreement is enforced by the Office of the High Representative.

EUFOR&#x27;s commander is Major General László Sticz of Hungary. For this mission, the European Union Military Staff is using NATO&#x27;s Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) as the EU&#x27;s Operational Headquarters (OHQ) and is working through the Deputy to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, a European officer.

EUFOR assumed all the missions of SFOR, except for the hunt for individuals indicted by the war crimes tribunal, notably Radovan Karadžić, former leader of Republika Srpska, and Ratko Mladić, their former military leader, which remained a mission for NATO through NATO Headquarters Sarajevo. EUFOR does have police duties against organised crime, which is believed to be linked to suspected war criminals. It worked with the European Union Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUPM) and with the Bosnian Police. The European Union Special Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina provides political guidance on military issues with a local political dimension to the EUFOR.

, the total force of EUFOR is approximately 1,000 troops from 22 countries, including EU member states and non-EU &quot;Troop Contributing Countries&quot; (TCC) are present within EUFOR (Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, North Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, and Turkey).

On 18 December 2020, the United Kingdom marked the end of its 16-year contribution to EUFOR, following Brexit.

As of early 2021, EUFOR personnel bases include: 
* Multinational Battalion is EUFOR&#x27;s military maneuver unit for BiH, located at Camp Butmir, Sarajevo, and comprises troops from Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Turkey.
* 19 LOT Houses located throughout BiH to connect EUFOR to local communities and authorities. Houses are located in Cazin, Banja Luka (Romania) and Banja Luka (Chile), Brčko, Doboj, Tuzla, Zavidovići, Travnik, Bratunac, Zenica, Vlasenica, Sarajevo, Livno, Jablanica, Višegrad, Foča, Mostar, Čapljina and Trebinje.

<doc id="1236143" wikidata="Q4736417" url="?curid=1236143" title="Alternating knot">
<text>In knot theory, a knot or link diagram is alternating if the crossings alternate under, over, under, over, as one travels along each component of the link. A link is alternating if it has an alternating diagram.

Many of the knots with crossing number less than 10 are alternating. This fact and useful properties of alternating knots, such as the Tait conjectures, was what enabled early knot tabulators, such as Tait, to construct tables with relatively few mistakes or omissions. The simplest non-alternating prime knots have 8 crossings (and there are three such: 819, 820, 821).

It is conjectured that as the crossing number increases, the percentage of knots that are alternating goes to 0 exponentially quickly.

Alternating links end up having an important role in knot theory and 3-manifold theory, due to their complements having useful and interesting geometric and topological properties. This led Ralph Fox to ask, &quot;What is an alternating knot?&quot; By this he was asking what non-diagrammatic properties of the knot complement would characterize alternating knots.

In November 2015, Joshua Evan Greene published a preprint that established a characterization of alternating links in terms of definite spanning surfaces, i.e. a definition of alternating links (of which alternating knots are a special case) without using the concept of a link diagram.

Various geometric and topological information is revealed in an alternating diagram. Primeness and splittability of a link is easily seen from the diagram. The crossing number of a reduced, alternating diagram is the crossing number of the knot. This last is one of the celebrated Tait conjectures.

An alternating knot diagram is in one-to-one correspondence with a planar graph. Each crossing is associated with an edge and half of the connected components of the complement of the diagram are associated with vertices in a checker board manner.

==Tait conjectures==

The Tait conjectures are:
#Any reduced diagram of an alternating link has the fewest possible crossings.
#Any two reduced diagrams of the same alternating knot have the same writhe.
#Given any two reduced alternating diagrams D1 and D2 of an oriented, prime alternating link: D1 may be transformed to D2 by means of a sequence of certain simple moves called &quot;flypes&quot;. Also known as the Tait flyping conjecture. 
Morwen Thistlethwaite, Louis Kauffman and K. Murasugi proved the first two Tait conjectures in 1987 and Morwen Thistlethwaite and William Menasco proved the Tait flyping conjecture in 1991.

==Hyperbolic volume==

Menasco, applying Thurston&#x27;s hyperbolization theorem for Haken manifolds, showed that any prime, non-split alternating link is hyperbolic, i.e. the link complement has a hyperbolic geometry, unless the link is a torus link.

Thus hyperbolic volume is an invariant of many alternating links. Marc Lackenby has shown that the volume has upper and lower linear bounds as functions of the number of &quot;twist regions&quot; of a reduced, alternating diagram.

<text>Reassortment is the mixing of the genetic material of a species into new combinations in different individuals. The product of reassortment is called a reassortant. It is particularly used when two similar viruses that are infecting the same cell exchange genetic material. More specifically, it refers to the swapping of entire segments of the genome, which only occurs between viruses with segmented genomes. (All known viruses with segmented genomes are RNA viruses.)

== Flu virus ==
The classical example of reassortment is seen in the influenza viruses, whose genomes consist of eight distinct segments of RNA. These segments act like mini-chromosomes, and each time a flu virus is assembled, it requires one copy of each segment.

If a single host (a human, a chicken, or other animal) is infected by two different strains of the influenza virus, then it is possible that new assembled viral particles will be created from segments whose origin is mixed, some coming from one strain and some coming from another. The new reassortant strain will share properties of both of its parental lineages.

Reassortment is responsible for some of the major antigenic shifts in the history of the influenza virus. In the 1957 &quot;Asian flu&quot; and 1968 &quot;Hong Kong flu&quot; pandemics, flu strains were caused by reassortment between an avian virus and a human virus. In addition, the H1N1 virus responsible for the 2009 swine flu pandemic has an unusual mix of swine, avian and human influenza genetic sequences.

===Multiplicity reactivation===

When influenza viruses are inactivated by UV irradiation or ionizing radiation, they remain capable of multiplicity reactivation in infected host cells. If any of a virus&#x27;s genome segments is damaged in such a way as to prevent replication or expression of an essential gene, the virus is inviable when it, alone, infects a host cell (single infection). However, when two or more damaged viruses infect the same cell (multiple infection), the infection can often succeed (multiplicity reactivation) due to reassortment of segments, provided that each of the eight genome segments is present in at least one undamaged copy.

== Other viruses ==
The reptarenavirus family, responsible for inclusion body disease in snakes, shows a very high degree of genetic diversity due to reassortment of genetic material from multiple strains in the same infected animal.

<doc id="1236150" wikidata="Q178896" url="?curid=1236150" title="Apple Pascal">
<text>Apple Pascal is an implementation of Pascal for the Apple II and Apple III computer series, based on UCSD Pascal.
Just like other UCSD Pascal implementations, it ran on its own operating system (&quot;Apple Pascal Operating System&quot;, a derivative of &quot;UCSD p-System&quot; with graphical extensions).

Originally released for the Apple II in August 1979, just after Apple DOS 3.2, Apple Pascal pioneered a number of features that would later be incorporated into DOS 3.3, as well as others that would not be seen again until the introduction of ProDOS.

The Apple Pascal software package also included disk maintenance utilities, and an assembler meant to complement Apple&#x27;s built-in &quot;monitor&quot; assembler. A FORTRAN compiler (written by Silicon Valley Software of Sunnyvale, California) compiling to the same p-code as Pascal was also available.

==Comparison of Pascal OS with DOS 3.2==
Apple Pascal Operating System introduced a new disk format. Instead of dividing the disk into 256-byte sectors as in DOS 3.2, Apple Pascal divides it into &quot;blocks&quot; of 512 bytes each. The p-System also introduced a different method for saving and retrieving files. Under Apple DOS, files were saved to any available sector that the OS could find, regardless of location. Over time, this could lead to file system fragmentation, slowing access to the disk. Apple Pascal attempted to rectify this by saving only to consecutive blocks on the disk.

Other innovations introduced in the file system included the introduction of a timestamp feature. Previously only a file&#x27;s name, basic type, and size would be shown. Disks could also be named for the first time.

Limitations of the p-System included new restrictions on the naming of files. 
Writing files only on consecutive blocks also created problems, because over time free space tended to become too fragmented to store new files. A utility called codice_1 was included in the package to consolidate free space.

The biggest problem with the Apple Pascal system was that it was too big to fit on one floppy disk. This meant that on a system with only one floppy disk drive, frequent disk swapping was needed. A system needed at least two disk drives in order to use the operating system properly.

<doc id="1236159" wikidata="Q249591" url="?curid=1236159" title="Polish State Railways">
<text>The Polish State Railways ( , abbr.: PKP S.A.) is a Polish state-owned holding company (legally a sole-shareholder company of the State Treasury) comprising the rail transport holdings of the country&#x27;s formerly dominant namesake railway operator. The company was reformed in 2001 when the former Polish State Railways state-owned enterprise was divided into several units based on the need for separation between infrastructure management and transport operations. Polish State Railways is the dominant company in the PKP Group collective that resulted from the split, and maintains 100% share control, being fully responsible for the assets of all of the other PKP Group component companies.

==PKP today==

PKP is currently the parent company of the PKP Group, passenger operators PKP Intercity and PKP Szybka Kolej Miejska w Trójmieście. Freight carriers PKP Cargo and PKP Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa are also parts of the group. PKP is also one of the largest real estate managers in Poland.

==History==


=== World War I and interwar years ===
Regaining independence on 11 November 1918 allowed Poland to reclaim the former Russian and Austrian sectors from military railways. The Railway Department in the Ministry of Communication was created and the Polish railways were officially named &quot;Polskie Koleje Państwowe&quot;.

In December 1918, the Greater Poland Uprising started. The rebels took over the former Prussian sector of railways. One year later, the fights for Lwów were over and the former Austrian railway directorate was taken over by Poland. Taking over the railways from Prussians lasted until 1921.

After the victory over the Red Army in the Polish-Bolshevik War (1920), a great deal of damage in railway structure was discovered on the route along which the communists were retreating. At the same time, the tense relations with Lithuania led the railways around Vilnius and Minsk to a partial disintegration and stagnation. The Libau–Romny Railway was not recovered.

The Polish railways administration finally took over the railways in Upper Silesia in 1922. That same year, a decision was made to divide railways in Poland into nine administrative districts.

An economic crisis in the 1930s forced the state to cut back its budget for railway investment. Profit decreased by 50% compared to 1929. The next year, over 23,000 PKP employees had been dismissed and protests and strikes causes authorities to try to find a solution. The end of the crisis and an increase in cargo transport and income came in 1937.

=== World War II ===
Following the German invasion on 1 September 1939 and the Soviet invasion of eastern Poland on 17 September 1939, most Polish rolling stock fell into Soviet hands.
The Polish railways in Silesia, Greater Poland and Pomerania were adopted by German railways Deutsche Reichsbahn on 25 September. The Polish railways in Generalgouvernement became Ostbahn.

Until the last moment before the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, cargo trains transported goods from the Soviet Union to Germany. The beginning of German attacks on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 resulted in the possession of railway and rolling stock by the Ostbahn and the possession of PKP rolling stock with broad gauge track and reconstruction to standard gauge. The beginning of organized sabotage by the Polish resistance movement on railways took place about the same time.
In 1942, production of simple military-use DR &quot;Kriegslok&quot; BR52 (PKP class Ty2) steam locomotives began in Poznań and Chrzanów; the steam boilers for these locomotives were produced in Sosnowiec.

The Warsaw Uprising caused widespread damage of Warsaw rolling stock, network and electric traction; both bridges over the Vistula River and the tunnel on the Warsaw Cross-City Line were destroyed.
At the beginning of 1945, the Ministry of Transport was created, as well as the Regional Directorate of National Railways. Many pre-war locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union. Poland received many German locomotives as a compensation for war losses. In June, the rail connection with Warsaw was opened, using a temporary railway station made of warehouses. On 15 September 1945, PKP took over management of all railway lines on former German, now Polish Western and Northeastern land from the Soviet Union. Due to the Red Army&#x27;s rapid advance into Germany proper, the railway lines of Silesia, Farther Pomerania, and East Prussia largely remained intact, so that operations could be resumed. However, on many lines, the second track was removed and transported into the Soviet Union as war reparations. Because the Polish did have enough personnel, Germans continued their work, to be deported only in 1946. Renaming the station names took quite some time, often causing confusion because the decreed Polish names were once again changed. Maps of the Polish railroad network still reflect in the borders drawn in 1945, because in the lands annexed in 1945, railroad lines are relatively dense. In the former territory of Congress Poland, however, only a few main lines existed had been built in the 19th century.

=== Post-war years ===

During the mid-to-late communist era, the state of the Polish railways deteriorated to a large extent. Once a large and profitable network, the systemic lack of funding and failure to acquire new rolling stock left PKP far behind the railway operators of Western Europe in terms of technical advances and passenger comfort. In addition to this, the poor state of many rail lines throughout the country led to ever-increasing journey times for passengers, and as a result left the railways far less able to compete with intercity bus and air services. During the entire communist period, only one major infrastructural project relating to the railways was completed. This, the Central Trunk Line, was a prestige project completed in 1976, intended both for heavy coal transport and fast passenger services. This line for the first time allowed passengers to travel in comfort and at relatively high speed from Kraków and Katowice to Warsaw; however, high-speed services have never started, although test runs reached 250 km/h in 1994. Moreover, despite the successful completion of the section from southern to central Poland, the planned extension to Gdańsk and the country&#x27;s Baltic ports was never realised, and this significantly curtailed both the usefulness and potential of the line.

=== 1990 to today ===
Since Poland&#x27;s return to democracy in the early 1990s, the Polish State Railways have faced ever-increasing competition from private automotive transport and the country&#x27;s rapidly expanding network of motorways and express roads. However, ever-decreasing journey times, better schedules which allow for well-coordinated connections, the rise of private operators and large-scale investment in infrastructure, in many cases aided by European Union funding, as well as new rolling stock is slowly enticing people back onto the railways.

On 14 December 2014 PKP Intercity Pendolino trains began operating on the CMK line (224 km line from Kraków and Katowice to Warsaw) with trains reaching 200 km/h (124 mph) as a regularly scheduled operation. There is a plan by PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe (infrastructure manager) to increase speed to 250 km/h on whole line soon.
In the day of 13 December 2020 the speed limit was raised to 200 km/h also on the line from Warsaw to seaport Gdynia by New Pendolino train.

===Tourism===

The PKP has been a tourist attraction for British trainspotters since at least the mid-twentieth century. The late withdrawal of steam power on the PKP system meant that Poland was an attractive destination for rail enthusiasts long after steam had ended on Britain’s railways. The last PKP steam shed in Wolsztyn has remained in operation as a result of this tourism and continues to operate regular steam hauled services.

==Corporate Subdivisions==

===PKP Intercity===

PKP Intercity is a semi-independent division of PKP that operates long-distance passenger trains in Poland. It was founded in 2001 when, in preparation for separation between infrastructure management and transport operations, the Polish State Railways were reorganized into a number of independent operating companies under the unified direction of the PKP Group.

PKP Intercity operates all InterCity trains in Poland as well as most of the country&#x27;s EuroCity services throughout Europe. Although competition is rising in the long-distance rail travel market in Poland, PKP Intercity still holds a de facto monopoly in the industry, as its current market share represents almost 100% of the segment.

PKP Intercity&#x27;s trains currently (2015) operate under the following brands:

*Express InterCity Premium (EIP) - Pendolino high-speed trains
*EuroCity (EC): International trains which operate major routes and require a reservation
*Express InterCity (EIC) - introduced in 2009, as a result, the train category EX was phased out
*InterCity (IC) - Intercity trains
*Twoje Linie Kolejowe (TLK) - Low cost, intercity trains
*InterCityBus (ICBUS)- Intercity coach services

===PKP Cargo===
PKP Cargo (), founded in 2001 so as to satisfy a European Court ruling on the required restructuring of the Polish State Railways prior to joining the EU, is the PKP group company responsible for freight transport operations. It is currently the largest railway cargo carrier in Poland, and second-largest in the European Union.
The company was founded after dividing Polskie Koleje Państwowe (all-national rail operator) into several dozens of companies to meet European Union Standards.

PKP Cargo is owned by the PKP S.A. (50% + 1 share) and private investors.

===PKP Szybka Kolej Miejska===

It is a railway transportation service that originally functioned in Poland&#x27;s Tricity area (Gdynia, Sopot and Gdańsk). The system has since grown to cover a longer route, reaching towns like Słupsk, Lębork and Wejherowo.

It is serviced by electric multiple unit cars at a frequency of 6 minutes to half an hour between trains (depending on the time of day). It is comparable to subway service or light rail in other European cities. The Tricity area is uniquely suited for this mode of transport, as it&#x27;s shaped in a relatively narrow north–south corridor between the Gdańsk Bay and the Tricity Landscape Park.

===PKP Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa===

PKP LHS is a company of the PKP Group responsible for infrastructure operation and freight transport on the Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line. The line runs for about 400 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border in Izow-Hrubieszów to Sławków Południowy (near Katowice).

The line was opened in 1979 and was used to import iron ore from the USSR, as well as to export coal and sulphur from Poland.
After the fall of communism and the economic changes of 1989 traffic on the line has much diminished. At present various schemes are being tried to increase its profitability.
This line runs as a single-track line for almost 400 km, from the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing just east of Hrubieszów to Sławków Południowy (near Katowice). It is used only for freight traffic, mainly iron ore and coal. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries which before 1991 constituted the Soviet Union.

==Power supply ==

Electric train traction of Polish State Railway started in 1936 in Warsaw area and is performed since the beginning with 3 kV DC. As of 1 January 2011, 11481 kilometres were electrified by a total length of 19276 kilometres.

All used power is taken from the public grid and rectified in substations. Most substations are fed with voltages between 15 and 30 kV. Where lines have heavy traffic and higher speed, the substations are fed from the 110 kV grid.

The switchyard of substations fed from voltages below 30 kV is indoors, outdoor switchgear is used at 110 kV. The distance between substations is between 15 and 28 kilometres. For reliability of supply, substations are usually fed by at least two powerlines. Each substation normally feeds two segments of the overhead wire, which are separated by a switch. As is common with DC systems, the negative pole is grounded.
Halfway between two substations, there is a switch, which can be used to connect the overhead wires together. At some lines, a three-phase AC line operated with 6 kV, 15 kV or 20 kV runs parallel to the railway line, either on the poles of the overhead wire or on separate poles. It is used for power supply of signals, level crossing equipment and other devices requiring electric power used for the rail. This line can be also used for emergency power supply of substations.

==Former PKP group companies==

===PKP Przewozy Regionalne===

Until 22 December 2008 Przewozy Regionalne was a wholly owned subsidiary of the PKP Group; after that date, all of its shares have been transferred to Poland&#x27;s 16 regional governments. Thus, the company is no longer part of the PKP Group and on interregional routes its InterRegio trains compete with PKP Intercity TLK trains. This was done in order to increase competition amongst operators on the Polish rail network. The company finally changed its name from &quot;PKP Przewozy Regionalne&quot; to &quot;Przewozy Regionalne&quot; on 8 December 2009.

===Polskie Linie Kolejowe===
A company responsible for maintenance of rail tracks, conducting trains across the country, scheduling train timetables, and management of railway property, such as lines and stations. In 2024 PKP owns 16.54% of this company&#x27;s shares.

===PKP Energetyka===

A company responsible for supplying Polish railroad operators with electric energy. PKP Energetyka was founded after dividing PKP into a group of several dozen independent companies to meet European Union Standards.

PKP Group sold PKP Energetyka to CVC Capital Partners in 2015, which in turn sold it to PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna in 2022.

<text>The Battle of Tippermuir (also known as the Battle of Tibbermuir) (1 September 1644) was the first battle James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose, fought for King Charles I in the Scottish theatre of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the battle, Montrose&#x27;s Royalist forces routed an army of the Covenanter-dominated Scottish government under John Wemyss, Lord Elcho. The government side took heavy losses.

The battlefield is presently inventoried and protected by Historic Environment Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy of 2009.

==Background==
Under the terms of the 1643 Solemn League and Covenant, the Scottish Parliament, dominated by a hardline Presbyterian faction known as the Covenanters, had agreed to intervene on the Parliamentarian side in the First English Civil War. At the invitation of the English Parliament, a large Scottish army under Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven entered England in January 1644. The Royalist party, fearing that the Scots intervention would prove decisive, sought to find ways of tying down troops in Scotland to prevent them assisting the English Parliamentarians.

King Charles I had already designated Montrose, a disaffected former signatory of the Covenant, as Captain-General in Scotland. An initial attempt by George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly and Montrose to begin a Royalist uprising misfired badly, but the Royalist plans were advanced when Confederate Ireland, at the instigation of the Earl of Antrim, aided the Royalists by sending 2000 professional soldiers to Scotland led by Antrim&#x27;s kinsman Alasdair Mac Colla. The Irish landed at Ardnamurchan on the west coast in early July 1644, and initially made to link up with Huntly, but the latter had by then effectively gone into hiding. Montrose was, however, able to meet Mac Colla at Blair Atholl late in August. Mac Colla had already been joined by a contingent from Clan MacDonald of Keppoch and had effectively compelled 400–500 men from Badenoch to join his force by pressuring local lairds. Their army was further increased by the addition of a small regiment of Athollmen raised for Montrose by Patrick Graham of Inchbrackie.

From Blair Atholl, Montrose made a rapid march south-eastwards towards the strategically sited town of Perth. With the majority of its best troops with Leslie in England, the Scottish government hastily assembled an army to defend the town under the overall command of John Wemyss, Lord Elcho and James Murray, Earl of Tullibardine. While Tullibardine and Elcho had two small regiments of relatively inexperienced regular troops, most of their men were untrained levies: the order to assemble at Perth only went out four days before the battle. A group of Perthshire levies from Clan Stewart, Clan Robertson and Clan Graham, led by Lord Kilpont, James Stewart of Ardvorlich and Montrose&#x27;s brother-in-law the Master of Madertie, were amongst those called out by the government but promptly deserted to the Royalists.

==Battle==
===Order of battle and deployments===
Montrose&#x27;s Highlanders and the Irish regiments together possibly made up no more than 2,000 men, perhaps rising to 3,000 through further recruitment on the march from Blair Atholl. The Irish troops were likely experienced soldiers, although the remaining Royalists were either levies or &#x27;irregulars&#x27;. The traditional historiography of the battle suggests that Elcho had up to 7,000 infantry and 800 cavalry, the latter being considered the &quot;cream of the army&quot;, along with local militia and a number of small frame guns. However, these figures are based largely on Royalist accounts, and a figure of 2,000 footmainly untrained militiaand 400 horse may be more accurate for the Covenanter side. Indeed, some modern historians such as Stuart Reid have suggested that the Royalist forces outnumbered the government troops.

*Royalist (James Graham, Lord Montrose)
**Patrick Graham of Inchbrakie&#x27;s Regiment
**Irish Brigade (Alasdair Mac Colla)
***Thomas Laghtnan&#x27;s Regiment
***Manus O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s Regiment
***James Macdonnell&#x27;s Regiment
**Badenoch levies
**Perthshire levies (Lord Kilpont)
**MacDonalds of Keppoch
*Covenanter (John Wemyss, Lord Elcho)
**Earl of Tullibardine&#x27;s Regiment
**Lord Elcho&#x27;s Regiment
**Dundee and Forfarshire levies
**Perth Trained Bands (Captain David Grant)
**Sir James Scott of Rossie&#x27;s Regiment of Horse
**Lord Drummond&#x27;s Regiment of Horse

The two armies deployed on the relatively flat ground at Tippermuir, three miles outside of Perth. On the Covenanters&#x27; side, Lord Elcho commanded the right wing of cavalry, Tullibardine commanded the centre, made up of infantry, and the left flank of cavalry was given over to Sir James Scott of Rossie, the only veteran soldier present in the Covenant army that day. Montrose put Lord Kilpont and his 400 levies on the left, directly in front of Elcho, along with the Keppoch MacDonalds. Montrose commanded the right wing, made up of Inchbrackie&#x27;s Athollmen, himself: in the centre he placed the Irish under Mac Colla, backed with the Badenoch men. According to Ruthven, Montrose drew up his troops in a line only three deep, outflanking Elcho&#x27;s front, though it seems likely the Royalist centre was kept a more conventional six lines deep.

Again according to the traditional historiography of the battle, the battle cry of Elcho&#x27;s force was said to have been &quot;Jesus and no quarter!&quot; Montrose&#x27;s Irish troops were said to have been reduced to a single round of ammunition each, and Montrose is supposed to have delivered a speech saying: &quot;Gentlemen: it is true you have no arms; your enemy, however, to all appearance, have plenty. My advice to you therefore is that as there happens to be a great abundance of stones upon this moor, every man should provide himself, in the first place, with as stout a one as he can manage, rush up to the first Covenanter he meets, beat out his brains, take his sword, and then I believe he will be at no loss how to proceed!&quot; Another version of the speech runs &quot;Be sparing of your powder, we have none to throw away. Let not a musket be fired except in the very face of the enemy. Give but a single discharge, and then at them with the claymore, in the name of God and the King&quot;.

===The actions===
Tullibardine first sent forward a group of cavalry and foot in skirmish to engage the Irish, possibly to take advantage of the latter&#x27;s shortage of ammunition. However, the Irish skirmishers drove back their opponents, causing a degree of confusion in the government centre. Montrose then gave an order to charge, and Mac Colla&#x27;s experienced troops moved forward, clashing violently with the largely untrained militia making up Tullibardine&#x27;s infantry: the first and second ranks rapidly lost their composure and began to fall back.

Scott of Rossie attempted to hold the left flank, but Montrose led his Athollmen in a charge that placed them in front of Scott&#x27;s men, and pushed them back into the main body of the Covenanters. While there was an attempt by some of the Covenanters to rally and regroup, most of their troops quickly broke and were routed. As was common in fighting of the era, the majority of casualties occurred in the rout as the battle now turned into a bloodbath. A group of townspeople had come to view the battle, believing Montrose&#x27;s army would be quickly subdued. Now they were caught up in the slaughter, and in the confusion many died. It was reported that a man could walk from Tippermuir to Perth on the bodies of the slain.

Elcho is reported, in some accounts, to have lost up to 2,000 men and Montrose only one, plus another man who died afterwards. Others suggest that only twelve men in total were killed on the field, but the bodies of a further 400 were found between Tippermuir and Perth where they had been cut down in the rout. The dead included several prominent gentry: Captain David Grant, who had led the Perth militia, William Forbes the Laird of Reires, Patrick Oliphant of Bachilton, and George Haliburton of Kelior. However, there are no independent estimates of casualties and as with the relative size of the two armies, the largest figures may likely represent Royalist propaganda.

==Aftermath==
Perth was surrounded by Montrose&#x27;s forces later that day, and surrendered almost immediately. Although the town did not suffer major damage, it was sacked for two days by the victorious Royalist troops, with cloth to the value of £1,300 stolen from local merchants. However, Montrose vacated Perth on 4 September, partly to seek more recruits in Angus and partly as a stronger government force under the Marquess of Argyll was approaching the town from the west.

One of the Royalist commanders, Lord Kilpont, was murdered in a quarrel by fellow Royalist James Stewart of Ardvorlich shortly after the battle. Stewart escaped and was later to join with the Covenanters, being given the rank of Major in Argyll&#x27;s regiment. The battle effectively revived the Royalist cause in Scotland, and Montrose would confront, and rout, government troops again at Aberdeen later in the month. 

Events leading up to the battle and the Royalist campaign of 1644–1645 are the centre piece of the 1937 novel &quot;And No Quarter&quot; by the Irish writer Maurice Walsh.

<text>Manuel Leaonedas Ayulo (October 20, 1921 – May 17, 1955) was an American racecar driver. His efforts, along with those of friend and teammate Jack McGrath, helped establish track roadsters as viable race cars. Ayulo was killed in practice for the 1955 Indianapolis 500 when his car crashed straight into a concrete wall. He was found to have not been wearing a seat belt and his pockets &quot;were filled with wrenches&quot;.

<doc id="1236166" wikidata="Q115563951" url="?curid=1236166" title="Eustace Tilley">
<text>Eustace Tilley is a caricature that appeared on the cover of the first issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1925 and has appeared on the cover in various forms of every anniversary issue of the magazine except 2017. He was not initially named, but acquired the name from Corey Ford in subsequent issues as part of a fictional magazine history backstory included to fill the early issues of the magazine. The original cover, showing Tilley examining a butterfly through his monocle, was drawn by Rea Irvin, but a younger and more modern-looking version of him as drawn by Johan Bull in subsequent months appeared throughout the magazine in its early years. This later version was given the name Tilley and subsequently the original cover was also declared to be Tilley. Because of the cover&#x27;s prominence, almost all of the references to Tilley in the press discuss the Irvin version. 

Irvin drew three versions of the masthead artwork that featured Tilley in 1925 and 1926. Irvin&#x27;s third version from 1926 was not updated or revamped until the May 22, 2017, issue with artwork by Christoph Niemann. In 2023, Niemann drew a robot named Till-E for the magazine.

Until 1994, the original cover artwork was reproduced for the annual anniversary edition, but, since then, there has been significant variation in how his character has been embodied. He has become the mascot of the magazine and is described as a dandy. There have been two years without any anniversary issue and in other years, when the anniversary celebration/remembrance has broken from previously-established tradition, it has resulted in stories in publications such as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Since 2008, artists have competed in an annual Eustace Tilley contest with prizes that include the potential to have their artistic interpretation submissions chosen for the anniversary cover. All contest submissions are derived from Irvin&#x27;s version.

==Origin==

Tilley was born out of necessity when the coverless first edition of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was set to print. After editor-in-chief and founder Harold Ross was unsatisfied by the array of artist submissions under the theme of &quot;a curtain going up on Manhattan&quot;, Ross turned to art editor Rea Irvin with the directive to produce a cover that &quot;would make the subscribers feel that we&#x27;ve been in business for years and know our way around&quot;. Irvin was &quot;The New Yorker&quot; first employee and its de facto art editor. He drew the magazine&#x27;s first cover of the character, modelling him on a caricature of Alfred d&#x27;Orsay in the December 1834 edition of &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. This caricature can be found under the subject &quot;costume&quot; in the 11th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; published in 1910 (&quot;Costume&quot;, &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, eleventh edition, vol. 7 (New York: Encyclopædia Britannica Co., 1910), 244, fig. 47.). Irvin, who had four months earlier drawn a magazine cover of a well-clad gentleman, added features to the 19th-century stylistic source image: a monocle to represent erudite intellect as well as a butterfly for &quot;whimsey&quot;.

Since advertisers were not filling the pages of the unfamiliar magazine at first, it commissioned Corey Ford to fill the pages with a series of humor pieces that &quot;pretended to provide an inside look at the making of the magazine&quot; with illustrations of the mascot, in which he was dubbed with the name Eustace Tilley. His appearances in the series is likened thematically to &quot;Where&#x27;s Wally?&quot;/&quot;Where&#x27;s Waldo?&quot; Tilley was presented as the hero of Ford&#x27;s series which was titled &quot;The Making of a Magazine&quot;. He was introduced inside front cover of the August 8, 1925, issue with a more youthful appearance than that of the original cover art subject. Ford combined the last name of a somewhat humorous aunt of his with the name Eustace due to euphony. His top hat was of a newer style, without the curved brim. He wore a morning coat and striped formal trousers. The series ran for 21 chapters of pseudo-intellectual parody and first presented Tilley in close-up in Chapter XVII. The range of activities and duties held by Tilley within the magazine in the decades after &quot;The Making of a Magazine&quot; gave a reputation as a man of action on top of his erudite man of taste presentation. For &quot;The Making of a Magazine&quot; chapters, Tilley was drawn with modern attire of the day by Johan Bull (whose tenure with the magazine seems to have ended in 1927), although each feature&#x27;s layout was ornamented with Irvin&#x27;s 19th-century-cladded version at the top. At some point well after Tilley was named on the inside we are told that he is the same named person in the original cover art that would be reused annually. In Chapter XX, we are told that Eustace was born to Mrs. Terwilliger Tilley on January 1, 1876.

Ross believed Tilley was the highlight of the inaugural issue and each year that the magazine managed to survive, he acknowledged this by putting him on the cover again. By appearing on the cover exactly as originally drawn every year for decades on the issue closest to the anniversary date of February 21, Tilley has become a kind of mascot for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. He has frequently made appearance within the magazine and on promotional materials, with occasional artistic license used to provide variation on his appearance. More recent anniversary editions have &quot;parodied, subverted or deconstructed&quot; the original artwork.

==Persona==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as follows: &quot;The enduring symbol of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine—the aristocratic, top-hatted Regency dandy, Eustace Tilley, studying a fluttering pale pink butterfly through a monocle&quot;. &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; says his depiction is incongruous: &quot;a seeming sophisticated man-about-town who is so vapidly empty-headed as to find a fluttering insect an object worthy of minute inspection.&quot; Crosstown rival magazine &quot;New York&quot; describes him as a dandy who has always been somewhat condescending. ABC News describes him as &quot;foppish&quot;. The Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University in their &quot;Nieman Reports&quot; stated that Tilley portrays the &quot;essence&quot; of the magazine—&quot;a slightly condescending but consummately tasteful arbiter of the larger world&quot;.

==Rebirth==
The 1994 version broke with tradition by substituting for the dandy a drawing by R. Crumb of a contemporary city youth wearing a logo t-shirt and a backwards baseball cap and looking at – instead of a butterfly – a flyer for a pornographic theater. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described this version as bearing mere resemblance to the original staid and wing-collared Tilley, rather than being a copy, but with similarities that included the &quot;long neck, the pointy nose, the all-but-concealed eye, even the penciled arch of eyebrow&quot;. Twice in the late 1990s there was no anniversary edition.

January 7, 2013, was the deadline for the sixth annual Eustace Tilley contest in which readers submit their own interpretations of the magazine&#x27;s mascot. This suggests the original annual contest was for the 2008 issue. User submissions for the original contest can be found online at Flickr. Nine winning entries from nearly three hundred entries were announced in a published release dated February 4, 2008. The original contest earned coverage by outlets such as Gothamist. The 2008 cover was produced in homage to the ongoing 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries as a two-headed face card dubbed Eustace Tillarobama, with depictions of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. By the time of the sixth annual edition, editors selected 12 winners and readers subsequently voted to determine 5 readers&#x27; choice winners. When interviewed by &quot;New York&quot;, 2013 contest winner Simon Greiner described his hipster work on updating of Tilley&#x27;s physical cues based on the original as follows: &quot;the sideburns into the beard, the monocle into the eyeglasses, the coat, and the hat&quot;.

In protest of Executive Order 13769 by Donald Trump, the newly seated President of the United States, Tilley was not depicted on the 2017 anniversary issue, instead appearing two issues later. That year&#x27;s anniversary cover was art from John W. Tomac that was based on the hand and torch of the Statue of Liberty in an effort to stand behind American values that welcomed immigrants in contrast to the values Trump expressed via executive order. The March 7, 2017, cover featured a human observer resembling Vladimir Putin and the usual lepidopteran subject of observation with a Trump–based head to highlight the New Cold War. The work by artist Barry Blitt is titled &quot;Eustace Vladimirovich Tilley&quot;.

By the time of the 2021 edition of the Eustace Tilley contest, there had been years in which none of the winners actually appeared on the cover and other years in which multiple covers with depictions of the character by multiple artists were published. The range of variations have been significant. The mascot had twice been manifested by contest winners as a female Eustacia (once on an anniversary edition cover and once in the summer). Tilley has also been depicted by contest winners as a youthful punk and a youthful hipster as well as a wide variety of character contexts. The 2023 winner and anniversary cover veteran, Tomac, presented Eustace in canine form.

==Christoph Niemann era==

In 2015, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published nine different covers for its 90th anniversary edition, and a digital art version by Christoph Niemann was one of the female versions among the selectees. Starting with the May 22, 2017, issue, Tilley was redrawn for the masthead by Niemann. The new depiction included the elimination of Tilley&#x27;s character lines in his hair, face, and jacket; elimination of dots in his jacket; narrowing of his body; and smoothing of his face. In addition, the owl has been slimmed, and had some lines eliminated. The skyline of buildings was also revamped to include the new World Trade Center and an erect building that resembles the Leaning Tower of Pisa; eliminate spacing between buildings; replace other unique buildings with generic ones. 

Many other elements of the masthead have been smoothed out or slimmed to eliminate the human touch or give different effects. Niemann drew the November 20, 2023-dated issue cover of a robot as a representation of an artificial intelligence helper and named the robot Till-E as part of an AI-themed cover story published November 13.

<doc id="1236170" wikidata="Q736349" url="?curid=1236170" title="Vanya on 42nd Street">
<text>Vanya on 42nd Street is a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Louis Malle, written by Andre Gregory, and starring Wallace Shawn and Julianne Moore. The film is an intimate, interpretive performance of the 1899 play &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; by Anton Chekhov as adapted by David Mamet.

==Premise==
Actors in New York City rehearse &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; in a dilapidated theatre.

==Cast==

The film also features Madhur Jaffrey and Andre Gregory as himself. Shawn, Gregory, and Malle had previously collaborated on the 1981 film &quot;My Dinner with Andre.&quot; Several actors known to the New York stage are featured, including George Gaynes, Larry Pine, Phoebe Brand, Brooke Smith, and Lynn Cohen.

Moore, whose film career was gaining critical attention because of her performance in &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, was prominently featured in the advertising campaign for the film.

The soundtrack features music by the Joshua Redman Quartet, with Redman on tenor saxophone, Brad Mehldau on piano, Christian McBride on bass, and Brian Blade on drums.

==Production==
Over the course of three years, director Andre Gregory and a group of actors came together on a voluntary basis in order to better understand Chekhov&#x27;s work through performance workshops. Staged entirely within the vacant shell of the then-abandoned New Amsterdam Theater on 42nd Street in New York City, they enacted the play rehearsal-style on a bare stage with the actors in street clothes. Free from any commercial demands, their performances were for an invited audience only. Gregory and director Louis Malle decided to document the play as they had developed it. The film was the result of the collaborative process. It was the last film of Malle&#x27;s career.

===Filming===
Workshop rehearsals with Gregory and the cast originally took place at the abandoned Victory Theater on 42nd Street in New York City. The filmed version was shot entirely within the New Amsterdam Theatre, also on 42nd Street. Built in 1903, the theatre was the original home of the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, a historical tidbit mentioned in the film during some pre-show banter. In the late 1930s, the New Amsterdam Theatre was transformed into a movie palace. The theatre remained a movie palace until it &quot;temporarily&quot; closed in 1982.

At the time &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot; was filmed, the theatre had been abandoned for over ten years and was in a state of severe disrepair. Rats had chewed through much of the stage rigging, and flooding and mice made the stage unusable, so that they were restricted to a section of what had been the orchestra.

For the film production, some rows of seats were removed and a small platform was built for the cast and film crew. Shortly after the production of &quot;Vanya&quot;, the New Amsterdam was leased to The Walt Disney Company. Disney restored the theatre to its grand original design and reopened it in 1997.

&quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 89% approval rating, based on 37 reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Beautiful performances and the subtle hand of master Louis Malle make this adaptation of Chekov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; an eccentric presentation of an enduring classic.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. &quot;As he did with &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;&quot;, Ebert wrote, &quot;[Malle shows] he is the master of a visual style suited to tightly-encompassed material. There is not a shot that calls attention to itself, and yet not a shot that is without thought.&quot;

<text>John Ashley Thomson (April 9, 1922 – September 24, 1960) was an American racecar driver. Thomson was nicknamed &quot;the Flying Scot.&quot; He won several championships in midgets and sprint cars before competing in Championship Car (now IndyCar) racing. He won the pole position for the 1959 Indianapolis 500.

==Background==
Thomson was born on April 9, 1922, to William and Marion Ross Thomson. He graduated from Lowell High School then the New England Aircraft School.

He served in the United States Air Force as a crew chief during World War II in Corsica and Italy between 1942 and 1945 on a B-25 bomber. Thomson was awarded five service stars and the Distinguished Air Force Medal.

Thomson met his future wife Evelyn Peterson in 1951. He moved from the Springfield, Massachusetts, area to a five-acre ranch that he built near Boyertown, Pennsylvania, in the mid 1950s.

==Midget cars==
Thomson began watching races at a track across the street from his home in 1937 and 1938 in Lowell. He began racing at the track in 1938 against his parents&#x27; wishes with a V8-engined car that he built himself. After returning from the war, he resumed racing midgets at the Bay State Racing Association. His first win happened at Seekonk Speedway in 1946 and he won seven times in 1947. 

Thomson won the 1948 United Car Owners Association (UCOA) New England title after winning 32 midget events. He won his second UCOA title in 1949; he also race in some American Racing Drivers Club (ARDC) events. He switched to the ARDC in 1950 to finish fifth in points and took second in points in 1951.

He won the 1952 AAA Eastern division midget car championship after winning twice at Williams Grove Speedway.

==Championship cars==
He drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1953-1960 seasons with 69 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 races in each season. He finished in the top ten 43 times, with 7 victories. His best Indy finish was third in 1959 after starting the race on the pole position. Roy Sherman, the first National Midget Champion, was his chief mechanic for several Indy 500s.

He won his first champ car race at the Milwaukee Mile in 1955. He ended up finishing third in season points after having to sit out the middle part of the season while healing from a end over end flip at the Langhorne Speedway circle. He clipped Jerry Hoyt&#x27;s car while in the lead; he broke five ribs, bruised his vertebrae, broke his shoulder in eight places. In 1957, Thomson won at Langhorne; he also earned two pole positions. In October, he crashed at the California State Fairgrounds Race Track suffering internal injuries. In 1958, he finished third with wins at the Springfield Mile, DuQuoin State Fairgrounds, California Fairgrounds, and Syracuse Mile. He earned two pole positions in 13 starts. In 1959, he raced primarily in champ cars and finished third in national points after a win at Milwaukee plus three fast times. He had a wreck in a sprint car race at Williams Grove in September and missed the rest of the season.

He was the first driver to win a dirt track race in less than an hour at Langhorne Speedway. His champ car&#x27;s average speed was 100.174 miles per hour.

==Sprint cars==
Thomson made his first &quot;Big Car&quot; (now sprint car) start in September 1952 at the Vermont State Fairgrounds. He primarily raced on the AAA Eastern circuit in 1953; he finished ninth after winning at Altamont, New York. Thomson won the Eastern AAA Big Car championship in 1954 after winning eight events. AAA ended sanctioning after the 1955 season and it was replaced by the United States Automobile Club (USAC) in 1956. He continued in the Eastern Division in 1956 and had wins at Williams Grove, Trenton Speedway, and Reading Fairgrounds Speedway; he finished second in points behind Tommy Hinnershitz. Thomson&#x27;s sprint car races in 1957 were primarily in the USAC Eastern division; he won twice at Reading and once at the Allentown fairgrounds to finish third in points. Thomas returned from injury to win the first 1958 USAC Sprint Car Series Eastern race at Williams Grove; he followed up with two wins at Reading and one at Allentown to win the Eastern championship.

==Death==
On September 24, 1960, Thomson was racing in a USAC Sprint Car at the Great Allentown Fair at the Allentown Fairgrounds. On a rutty and dry track, his car flipped and crashed through the backstretch fence and flipped into the infield. He was thrown out of the car and was pinned underneath the car after it stopped rolling. His leg was broken, and he died several hours later at Allentown General Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania, at age 38. His friend Tommy Hinnershitz announced his retirement from racing shortly after Thomson&#x27;s death.

Thomson was survived by his wife and four sons (Dale, Dana, David and Darryl).

==Career awards==
Thomson was inducted in the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 1996 and the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame in 1997.

==Television Appearance==
Thomson was a contestant on Bud Collyer&#x27;s &quot;Beat The Clock&quot;.

==World Championship career summary==
The Indianapolis 500 was part of the FIA World Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indy during those years were credited with World Championship points and participation. Johnny Thomson participated in 8 World Championship races. He started on the pole once, set 1 fastest lead lap, and finished on the podium once, accumulating a total of 10 World Championship points.

<doc id="1236187" wikidata="Q1192422" url="?curid=1236187" title="Pipeline (computing)">
<text>In computing, a pipeline, also known as a data pipeline, is a set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one. The elements of a pipeline are often executed in parallel or in time-sliced fashion. Some amount of buffer storage is often inserted between elements.

== Concept and motivation ==
Pipelining is a commonly used concept in everyday life. For example, in the assembly line of a car factory, each specific task—such as installing the engine, installing the hood, and installing the wheels—is often done by a separate work station. The stations carry out their tasks in parallel, each on a different car. Once a car has had one task performed, it moves to the next station. Variations in the time needed to complete the tasks can be accommodated by &quot;buffering&quot; (holding one or more cars in a space between the stations) and/or by &quot;stalling&quot; (temporarily halting the upstream stations), until the next station becomes available.

Suppose that assembling one car requires three tasks that take 20, 10, and 15 minutes, respectively. Then, if all three tasks were performed by a single station, the factory would output one car every 45 minutes. By using a pipeline of three stations, the factory would output the first car in 45 minutes, and then a new one every 20 minutes.

As this example shows, pipelining does not decrease the latency, that is, the total time for one item to go through the whole system. It does however increase the system&#x27;s throughput, that is, the rate at which new items are processed after the first one.

=== In computing ===
In computing, a pipeline or data pipeline is a set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one. The elements of a pipeline are often executed in parallel or in time-sliced fashion. Some amount of buffer storage is often inserted between elements.

Computer-related pipelines include:
* Instruction pipelines, such as the classic RISC pipeline, which are used in central processing units (CPUs) and other microprocessors to allow overlapping execution of multiple instructions with the same circuitry. The circuitry is usually divided up into stages and each stage processes a specific part of one instruction at a time, passing the partial results to the next stage. Examples of stages are instruction decode, arithmetic/logic and register fetch. They are related to the technologies of superscalar execution, operand forwarding, speculative execution and out-of-order execution.
* Graphics pipelines, found in most graphics processing units (GPUs), which consist of multiple arithmetic units, or complete CPUs, that implement the various stages of common rendering operations (perspective projection, window clipping, color and light calculation, rendering, etc.).
* Software pipelines, which consist of a sequence of computing processes (commands, program runs, tasks, threads, procedures, etc.), conceptually executed in parallel, with the output stream of one process being automatically fed as the input stream of the next one. The Unix system call pipe is a classic example of this concept.
* HTTP pipelining, the technique of issuing multiple HTTP requests through the same TCP connection, without waiting for the previous one to finish before issuing a new one.

== Design considerations ==
=== Balancing the stages ===
Since the throughput of a pipeline cannot be better than that of its slowest element, the designer should try to divide the work and resources among the stages so that they all take the same time to complete their tasks. In the car assembly example above, if the three tasks took 15 minutes each, instead of 20, 10, and 15 minutes, the latency would still be 45 minutes, but a new car would then be finished every 15 minutes, instead of 20.

=== Buffering ===
Under ideal circumstances, if all processing elements are synchronized and take the same amount of time to process, then each item can be received by each element just as it is released by the previous one, in a single clock cycle. That way, the items will flow through the pipeline at a constant speed, like waves in a water channel. In such &quot;wave pipelines&quot;, no synchronization or buffering is needed between the stages, besides the storage needed for the data items.

More generally, buffering between the pipeline stages is necessary when the processing times are irregular, or when items may be created or destroyed along the pipeline. For example, in a graphics pipeline that processes triangles to be rendered on the screen, an element that checks the visibility of each triangle may discard the triangle if it is invisible, or may output two or more triangular pieces of the element if they are partly hidden. Buffering is also needed to accommodate irregularities in the rates at which the application feeds items to the first stage and consumes the output of the last one.

The buffer between two stages may be simply a hardware register with suitable synchronization and signalling logic between the two stages. When a stage A stores a data item in the register, it sends a &quot;data available&quot; signal to the next stage B. Once B has used that data, it responds with a &quot;data received&quot; signal to A. Stage A halts, waiting for this signal, before storing the next data item into the register. Stage B halts, waiting for the &quot;data available&quot; signal, if it is ready to process the next item but stage A has not provided it yet.

If the processing times of an element are variable, the whole pipeline may often have to stop, waiting for that element and all the previous ones to consume the items in their input buffers. The frequency of such pipeline stalls can be reduced by providing space for more than one item in the input buffer of that stage. Such a multiple-item buffer is usually implemented as a first-in, first-out queue. The upstream stage may still have to be halted when the queue gets full, but the frequency of those events will decrease as more buffer slots are provided. Queueing theory can tell the number of buffer slots needed, depending on the variability of the processing times and on the desired performance.

=== Nonlinear pipelines ===
If some stage takes (or may take) much longer than the others, and cannot be sped up, the designer can provide two or more processing elements to carry out that task in parallel, with a single input buffer and a single output buffer. As each element finishes processing its current data item, it delivers it to the common output buffer, and takes the next data item from the common input buffer. This concept of &quot;non-linear&quot; or &quot;dynamic&quot; pipeline is exemplified by shops or banks that have two or more cashiers serving clients from a single waiting queue.

=== Dependencies between items ===
In some applications, the processing of an item Y by a stage A may depend on the results or effect of processing a previous item X by some later stage B of the pipeline. In that case, stage A cannot correctly process item Y until item X has cleared stage B.

This situation occurs very often in instruction pipelines. For example, suppose that Y is an arithmetic instruction that reads the contents of a register that was supposed to have been modified by an earlier instruction X. Let A be the stage that fetches the instruction operands, and B be the stage that writes the result to the specified register. If stage A tries to process instruction Y before instruction X reaches stage B, the register may still contain the old value, and the effect of Y would be incorrect.

In order to handle such conflicts correctly, the pipeline must be provided with extra circuitry or logic that detects them and takes the appropriate action. Strategies for doing so include:
* Stalling: Every affected stage, such as A, is halted until the dependency is resolved—that is, until the required information is available and/or the required state has been achieved.
* Reordering items: Instead of stalling, stage A may put item Y aside and look for any subsequent item Z in its input stream that does not have any dependencies pending with any earlier item. In instruction pipelines, this technique is called out-of-order execution.
* Guess and backtrack: One important example of item-to-item dependency is the handling of a conditional branch instruction X by an instruction pipeline. The first stage A of the pipeline, that fetches the next instruction Y to be executed, cannot perform its task until X has fetched its operand and determined whether the branch is to be taken or not. That may take many clock cycles, since the operand of X may in turn depend on previous instructions that fetch data from main memory.
: Rather than halt while waiting for X to be finished, stage A may guess whether the branch will be taken or not, and fetch the next instruction Y based on that guess. If the guess later turns out to be incorrect (hopefully rarely), the system would have to backtrack and resume with the correct choice. Namely, all the changes that were made to the machine&#x27;s state by stage A and subsequent stages based on that guess would have to be undone, the instructions following X already in the pipeline would have to be flushed, and stage A would have to restart with the correct instruction pointer. This branch prediction strategy is a special case of speculative execution.

== Typical software implementations ==
To be effectively implemented, data pipelines need a CPU scheduling strategy to dispatch work to the available CPU cores, and the usage of data structures on which the pipeline stages will operate on. For example, UNIX derivatives may pipeline commands connecting various processes&#x27; standard IO, using the pipes implemented by the operating system. Some operating systems may provide UNIX-like syntax to string several program runs in a pipeline, but implement the latter as simple serial execution, rather than true pipelining—namely, by waiting for each program to finish before starting the next one.

Lower level approaches may rely on the threads provided by the operating system to schedule work on the stages: both thread pool-based implementations or on a one-thread-per-stage are viable, and exist.

Other strategies relying on cooperative multitasking exist, that do not need multiple threads of execution and hence additional CPU cores, such as using a round-robin scheduler with a coroutine-based framework. In this context, each stage may be instantiated with its own coroutine, yielding control back to the scheduler after finishing its round task. This approach may need careful control over the process&#x27; stages to avoid them abuse their time slice.

== Costs and drawbacks ==
A pipelined system typically requires more resources (circuit elements, processing units, computer memory, etc.) than one that executes one batch at a time, because its stages cannot share those resources, and because buffering and additional synchronization logic may be needed between the elements.

Moreover, the transfer of items between separate processing elements may increase the latency, especially for long pipelines.

The additional complexity cost of pipelining may be considerable if there are dependencies between the processing of different items, especially if a guess-and-backtrack strategy is used to handle them. Indeed, the cost of implementing that strategy for complex instruction sets has motivated some radical proposals to simplify computer architecture, such as RISC and VLIW. Compilers also have been burdened with the task of rearranging the machine instructions so as to improve the performance of instruction pipelines.

== New technologies ==
It&#x27;s true that in recent years the demands on applications and their underlying hardware have been significant. For example, building pipelines with single node applications that trawl through the data row by row is no longer feasible with the volume and variety of big data. However, with the advent of data analytics engines such as Hadoop, or more recently Apache Spark, it&#x27;s been possible to distribute large datasets across multiple processing nodes, allowing applications to reach heights of efficiency several hundred times greater than was thought possible before. The effect of this today is that even a mid-level PC using distributed processing in this fashion can handle the building and running of big data pipelines.

<doc id="1236189" wikidata="Q2747004" url="?curid=1236189" title="The Story of Art">
<text>The Story of Art, by E. H. Gombrich, is a survey of the history of art from ancient times to the modern era.

First published in 1950 by Phaidon, the book is widely regarded both as a seminal work of criticism and as one of the most accessible introductions to the visual arts. It was originally intended for younger readers. Over eight million copies have been sold, and it has been translated into more than 30 languages. As of 2022, &quot;The Story of Art&quot; is in its 16th edition.

== Background ==
The art historian Ernst Gombrich had experience with book production before &quot;The Story of Art&quot;; he collaborated with Ernst Kris on an unpublished book on the history of caricature and published his first book on the history of the world for children in 1936. That same year, Gombrich relocated to London from Vienna for a job synthesising the late Aby Warburg&#x27;s notes for publication at the Warburg Institute. However, with the rise of the Second World War, Gombrich was sent to work as a broadcast translator at a BBC listening post in Evesham. There he met Béla Horovitz, founder of Phaidon Press, who was lacking materials to publish due to the war and was in search of new material. Gombrich, having already written a few chapters of an art history book for children while in Vienna, offered the work and was given an advance for the work that became &quot;The Story of Art&quot;, first published by Phaidon in 1950.

==Summary==
The book is divided into a preface, introduction, and 27 chapters that each deal with art within a defined time period and geographical context. A 28th chapter summarises the latest developments in visual arts.

The chapters in the 15th edition are listed as follows:

# &quot;Strange beginnings: Prehistoric and primitive peoples; Ancient America&quot;
# &quot;Art for eternity: Egypt, Mesopotamia, Crete&quot;
# &quot;The great awakening: Greece, seventh to fifth century BC&quot;
# &quot;The realm of beauty: Greece and the Greek world, fourth century BC to first century AD&quot;
# &quot;World conquerors: Romans, Buddhists, Jews and Christians, first to fourth century AD&quot;
# &quot;A parting of ways: Rome and Byzantium, fifth to thirteenth century&quot;
# &quot;Looking eastwards: Islam, China, second to thirteenth century&quot;
# &quot;Western art in the melting pot: Europe, sixth to eleventh century&quot;
# &quot;The Church militant: The twelfth century&quot;
# &quot;The Church triumphant: The thirteenth century&quot;
# &quot;Courtiers and burghers: The fourteenth century&quot;
# &quot;The conquest of reality: The early fifteenth century&quot;
# &quot;Tradition and innovation: The later fifteenth century in Italy&quot;
# &quot;Tradition and innovation: The fifteenth century in the North&quot;
# &quot;Harmony attained: Tuscany and Rome, early sixteenth century&quot;
# &quot;Light and colour: Venice and northern Italy, early sixteenth century&quot;
# &quot;The new learning spreads: Germany and the Netherlands, early sixteenth century&quot;
# &quot;A crisis of art: Europe, later sixteenth century&quot;
# &quot;Vision and visions: Catholic Europe, first half of the seventeenth century&quot;
# &quot;The mirror of nature: Holland, seventeenth century&quot;
# &quot;Power and glory: Italy, later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries&quot;
# &quot;Power and glory: France, Germany and Austria, late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries&quot;
# &quot;The age of reason: England and France, eighteenth century&quot;
# &quot;The break in tradition: England, America, and France, late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries&quot;
# &quot;Permanent revolution: The nineteenth century&quot;
# &quot;In search of new standards: The late nineteenth century&quot;
# &quot;Experimental art: The first half of the twentieth century&quot;
# &quot;A story without end: The triumph of Modernism / An altered mood / The changing past&quot;

Each chapter discusses a selection of works from the defined period, and all of the works discussed are accompanied by illustrations. More than half of the book&#x27;s pages are devoted to colour photographs of paintings, drawings, architecture and sculptures. In the preface, Gombrich explains that it has been his intention not to mention any work of art that he could not also include as an illustration.

== Style ==
&quot;The Story of Art&quot; is often described as a work that provides an accessible introduction to the subject of art history. The art historian T. S. R. Boase, writing in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, observed that Gombrich &quot;writes conversationally and intimately&quot;. Gombrich himself notes in the preface of the book that he intends to use &quot;plain language&quot; and to keep use of &quot;the art historian&#x27;s conventional terms&quot; to a minimum.

== Reception ==
First published by Phaidon Press in 1950 and in its 16th edition as of 2022, &quot;The Story of Art&quot; has been a global bestseller with more than 8 million copies sold; it has been translated into more than 30 languages. It is included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 100 best nonfiction books of all time. The first two sentences of the book have become famous: &quot;There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists&quot;. Gombrich later elaborated on this statement by saying that he defines &quot;art&quot; based on its Latin root, meaning &quot;skill&quot;, and that there is &quot;no disembodied skill&quot;.

Upon its release, &quot;The Story of Art&quot; was noted for its pedagogical potential despite Gombrich&#x27;s intentions of producing a pleasure read for teenagers. The artist and art history professor H. W. Janson, reviewing the book for &quot;College Art Journal&quot;, remarked that it was &quot;undoubtedly destined for a most successful career in the classroom&quot;. He praised the book for its accessible language and selections free from Gombrich&#x27;s own preferences, measuring the book against scholarly standards. In his discussion of the book in &quot;The Burlington Magazine&quot;, the artist and writer Wilfrid Blunt noted that &quot;The Story of Art&quot; reads like a lecture. Though he believed the lecture-like tone would lead masters to prefer the book rather than students, he declared that &quot;The Story of Art&quot; &quot;fully deserve[s] a place in any educational library&quot;.

Criticism has also emerged since the book&#x27;s release. One stream of criticism addresses Gombrich&#x27;s treatment of contemporary art. In a 1989 review for &quot;Art Journal&quot; of the book’s 14th edition, the art history professor Bradford R. Collins criticised the work for its lack of depth in its discussion of contemporary art. Collins indicated that Gombrich&#x27;s commentary on 20th-century art was brief and often dismissive. Elly Miller, daughter of Béla Horovitz, revealed in an interview that Gombrich had not originally intended to include an additional chapter on contemporary art and that &quot;he really didn&#x27;t come to terms with what he called modern art&quot;. The art curator Karen Wilkin made similar comments for &quot;The Hudson Review&quot;, remarking of &quot;The Story of Art&quot; that &quot;[Gombrich] was never really at ease with anything but illusionistic painting and sculpture&quot;.

Gombrich&#x27;s omission of non-Western and female artists has also been the subject of criticism, with no women having been included in the first &quot;The Story of Art&quot; and just one included in the 16th edition. With the intention of offsetting the emphasis on white, male, and Western works in Gombrich&#x27;s globally influential book, the curator and art historian Katy Hessel responded to the lack of diverse representation by creating a book of works by a range of international female artists titled &quot;The Story of Art Without Men&quot;, published in 2022.

<text>Johnny Boyd (August 19, 1926 – October 26, 2003) was an American racecar driver.

==Racing career==
Born in Fresno, California, Boyd drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series from 1954 to 1966 with 56 starts. He finished in the top ten 31 times, with his best finish in 2nd position, in 1959 at Milwaukee.

Boyd qualified for the Indianapolis 500 for the first time in 1955 but finished 29th after being involved in an accident that killed driver Bill Vukovich. In a dozen starts, his best race was in 1958, when he led 18 laps and finished 3rd. In total, he finished in the Top 10 at the 500 five times.

After 1949 Boyd had become close friends with Bob Sweikert of Hayward, California when he met him on the California racing circuit. The two often raced together, and Boyd qualified for entry in the 1955 Indianapolis 500 when Sweikert helped him overcome mechanical handling problems in Boyd&#x27;s car. Sweikert won the race that day, but was overshadowed by the death of Vukovich. Boyd also raced against Sweikert in 1956 at Indy, but Sweikert was killed several weeks later in a Sprint car race.

Boyd retired as a driver after failing to qualify for the Indy 500 and Milwaukee race in 1967. He died of cancer at age 77 in his hometown of Fresno.

==Awards==
In 1966, Boyd was inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame. He was named to the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame in 2010.

<text>James Richard Davies (August 8, 1929 – June 11, 1966) was an American racecar driver in Champ cars and midgets. He was the second man to win three USAC National Midget Championships. When Davies won the AAA Championship race at Del Mar, California on November 6, 1949 – aged 20 years, 2 months, 29 days, he became the youngest driver to win a race in a major U.S. open wheel series, a record not broken until Marco Andretti won the IRL race at Sonoma, California in 2006. Davies raced AAA on a false birth certificate showing him older (as did Troy Ruttman and Jim Rathmann), and was racing illegally.
==Midget car career==
In 1960 he won the USAC Pacific Coast Midget title as well as the National Midget Championship. He repeated as National Midget champion in 1961 and 1962. He won 46 feature events in the midgets in his career. Davies won the Night before the 500 midget race three times, in 1960 and 1961 at Kokomo Speedway, and next year at the Indianapolis Speedrome. Davies&#x27;s midget car was stolen but was recovered a year later when a driver was killed in it at Sacramento. Davies recognized the car in the newspaper photos of the wreck.

Davies also had success racing midgets (called Speedcars down under) in Australia and New Zealand during his career. He won the 1963 Australian Speedcar Grand Prix at the Sydney Showground Speedway, as well as the 1963 and 1964 South Australian Speedcar Championships at the Rowley Park Speedway in Adelaide.

He died on June 11, 1966, aged 36, from injuries suffered in a midget crash at Santa Fe Speedway in suburban Chicago.

<doc id="1236208" wikidata="Q172215" url="?curid=1236208" title="Jack McGrath (racing driver)">
<text>John James McGrath (October 8, 1919 – November 6, 1955) was an American racecar driver. McGrath died in an accident at Bobby Ball Memorial, he lost control of his car at Turn 3, crashed and flipped, dying instantly.

==Biography==
McGrath was born in Los Angeles, California, and grew up in South Pasadena, California.

A major player in the &quot;mighty midgets&quot; at Los Angeles&#x27;s Gilmore Speedway in the late 1940s, McGrath won the first CRA (California Roadster Association) championship in 1946 and was dubbed &quot;King of the Hot Rods&quot;. His efforts, along with those of friend and teammate Manuel Ayulo, helped establish track roadsters as viable race cars. The west coast roadsters evolved into sprint cars in the early 1950s.

Major wins at the AAA national level included the 1951 Syracuse and Langhorne 100 mile races, the 1952 Syracuse 100, and the 1953 Milwaukee 200. He finished the 1952 and 1953 AAA championship seasons in second place, and led the first 44 laps of the 1954 Indianapolis 500.

McGrath&#x27;s storied 26-lap duel with Bill Vukovich in the ill-fated 1955 Indianapolis 500 ended when the magneto on his Hinckle Special Kurtis 500C&#x27;s Offenhauser (Meyer-Drake) engine failed on lap 54. Fellow Californian and two-time Indy winner Vukovich died three laps later in a chain-reaction crash while in the lead.

The &quot;Splendid Splinter&quot; himself was killed in the final AAA dirt-track race of the 1955 season, the Bobby Ball Memorial at the one-mile dirt oval at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix, Arizona.

==Complete AAA Championship Car results==
==Indy 500 results==

*McGrath&#x27;s starting positions from 1951 to 1955 represent the best 5-year starting position streak in the Roadster Era.
*McGrath was the fastest overall qualifier of the Roadster Era.
*Although McGrath twice posted the fastest qualifying speed, he started from the pole only once when he was the first driver ever to crack the 140-mile-per-hour mark. That was in 1954, with Jimmy Daywalt and 1958 Indy 500 winner Jimmy Bryan to his right. In 1955, he started on the outside of the first row behind pole-day qualifiers Jerry Hoyt and Tony Bettenhausen.

==World Championship career summary==
The Indianapolis 500 was part of the FIA World Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indy during those years were credited with World Championship points and participation. Jack McGrath participated in 6 World Championship races. He started on the pole once, set 1 fastest lap, and finished on the podium twice. He accumulated a total of 9 championship points.

<text>.ke is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Kenya.

KENIC, short for Kenya Network Information Centre, is the authoritative agency responsible for managing the registrations and issuance of the .ke domain.

In 2002, KENIC assumed control of the .ke domain when it had a meager number of less than 1,000 registrations.

Prior to KENIC&#x27;s involvement, the administration of the domain was overseen by two individuals: Shem Ochuodho from Kenya and Randy Bush from America, both esteemed tech experts.

==Second-level domains==
Second-level domains, under which domains are registered at the third level, are:

* .co.ke: This is the most common .ke domain extension and is available for registration by anyone, both individuals and businesses, without specific restrictions. However, presence in Kenya is required.
* .or.ke: Intended for not-for-profit organizations operating in Kenya. To register a .or.ke domain, the organization must provide documentation proving its not-for-profit status.
* .ne.ke: for network devices
* .go.ke: for Government entities. Requires supporting documents
* .ac.ke: Reserved for academic institutions such as universities, colleges, and schools in Kenya. Proof of educational institution status is typically required.
* .sc.ke: for lower and middle institutes of learning. Requires supporting documents
* .me.ke: for personal names/websites
* .mobi.ke: for mobile content
* .info.ke: for informational content

== KeNIC&#x27;s Dispute Resolution ==
KeNIC (Kenya Network Information Centre) has established a dispute resolution process for handling domain name disputes related to .ke domains. This process is designed to resolve conflicts or disputes that may arise between parties over the registration and use of .ke domain names.

# &quot;Dispute Categories: KeNIC&#x27;s dispute resolution process covers various categories of disputes, including but not limited to:
#* Cybersquatting: This involves the bad-faith registration of a domain name with the intent to profit from the goodwill associated with someone else&#x27;s trademark.
#* Domain Name Similarity: Disputes over domain names that are similar to existing trademarks or other domain names.
#* Abusive Registrations: Disputes related to the abusive or unlawful use of a domain name.
# Complaint Filing: To initiate a dispute resolution process, the complainant (the party bringing the dispute) must file a complaint with KeNIC. The complaint should include detailed information about the dispute, evidence of rights to the domain name or trademark, and a description of how the domain name is being used in bad faith.
# Response: The respondent (the party against whom the complaint is filed) has the opportunity to respond to the complaint. They can provide evidence and arguments in their defense.
# Appointment of a Panel: KeNIC typically appoints an independent panel of experts to review the dispute. These experts are knowledgeable in domain name disputes and intellectual property matters.
# Decision: The panel will review the evidence and arguments presented by both parties and render a decision. This decision may involve actions such as the cancellation, transfer, or retention of the domain name in question.
# Appeal: In some cases, there may be a provision for appeal if either party disagrees with the panel&#x27;s decision. The appeal process, if available, would typically be outlined in KeNIC&#x27;s dispute resolution policies.
# Enforcement: Once a decision is reached, KeNIC will enforce it, which may involve transferring the domain name to the rightful owner or taking other appropriate actions.
# Fees: There may be fees associated with filing a complaint or participating in the dispute resolution process. The specific fee structure can be found on KeNIC&#x27;s website or through the appointed dispute resolution service provider.&quot;

<doc id="1236211" wikidata="Q2398442" url="?curid=1236211" title="Playoff beard">
<text>A playoff beard is the superstitious practice of male athletes not shaving their beards during playoffs. Playoff beards were introduced by ice hockey players participating in the Stanley Cup playoffs, and are now a tradition in many sports leagues. Many fans of professional sports teams also grow playoff beards. The player stops shaving when his team enters the playoffs and does not shave until his team is eliminated or wins the Stanley Cup (or equivalent championship).

The tradition was started in the early 1980s. Sometime in the early 1980s the New York Islanders decided to do so; and according to Islander Mike Bossy, was likely started by teammate Butch Goring. The 1984–85 Detroit Red Wings were the first team documented to wear them. Wings forwards Ivan Boldirev and Danny Gare began the practice in Jan. 1985, trying to inspire the team to win four straight games. Defenseman Brad Park called it his &quot;playoff beard&quot; - thus coining the phrase. The tradition is also practiced by nearly all North American hockey leagues, including high school leagues and the NCAA hockey teams, as well as minor league affiliates. According to some observers, one may trim the beard after a loss in an effort to change the team&#x27;s luck; Jim Dowd and Roberto Luongo are examples of players who did this.

==History==
The 1980 Islanders were the first team documented to wear them. This included two Swedish players (Stefan Persson and Anders Kallur), so it is possible that tennis champion Björn Borg&#x27;s custom of not shaving his beard during Wimbledon, which he had been doing for several years by that time, was an influence on the start of the practice in hockey. Some players have said the beard is both a reminder of team unity and a way to get a player thinking about the playoffs from the moment he looks in the mirror in the morning.The 1984–85 Detroit Red Wings also did it. Wings forwards Ivan Boldirev and Danny Gare began the practice in Jan. 1985, trying to inspire the team to win four straight games. Defenseman Brad Park called it his &quot;playoff beard&quot; - thus coining the phrase. (from the Detroit Free Press, February 3, 1985 - article by Bernie Czarniecki). Hall of Famer Denis Potvin says that the Islanders of the 1980s would &quot;play four games in five nights in the first round and it was just something that kind of happened.&quot; The 2009 Red Wings used the slogan &quot;The beard is back&quot; for the final series of their 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs run. They played the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Stanley Cup Finals that year (won by Pittsburgh) in which most of the players of both teams (and the owner of the Penguins, Mario Lemieux) grew beards.

In 2009, the Beard-a-thon campaign was launched to encourage fans to grow their own playoff beards for charity. In its first four years, more than 22,000 NHL fans participated in the &quot;Beard-a-thon&quot; and raised over two million dollars for charities.

In June 2015, Mark Lazarus, chairman of NBC Sports (who is the U.S. rightsholder of the league), told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that he had been lobbying the NHL to discourage the practice, arguing that it hinders the ability for viewers to recognize players.

==Other sports==
The playoff beard has expanded into Major League Baseball (MLB), the Canadian Football League (CFL), the National Football League (NFL) and, to a lesser extent, the National Basketball Association (NBA). The practice generally resembles that of ice hockey, in that players do not shave until they either win a championship or are eliminated.

===American football===
* National Football League (NFL) players who have grown playoff beards include Chicago Bears quarterback (QB) Mitchell Trubisky, Seattle Seahawks quarterback (QB) Russell Wilson, Pittsburgh Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger and defensive end (DE) Brett Keisel, New England Patriots wide receiver (WR) Julian Edelman and former Denver Broncos QB Jake Plummer. In fact, after Roethlisberger and his beard led the Steelers to their Super Bowl XL victory, he was shaved by David Letterman during an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman.

===Association football===
* In 1993, Sheffield United&#x27;s veteran striker Alan Cork did not shave during the club&#x27;s four-month FA Cup run where they ultimately reached the semi-finals.
* In Major League Soccer (MLS), players on the Houston Dynamo roster kept a &quot;lucky beard&quot; for the duration of the 2006 and 2007 MLS Cup Playoffs. They renewed the tradition during their run to the 2011 MLS Cup.
* The LA Galaxy grew playoff beards during their run to the 2005 MLS Cup and again during the 2010 MLS Cup Playoffs.

===Baseball===
* The Boston Red Sox featured many players who grew beards during the team&#x27;s 2013 season. &quot;The beard-growing movement began in spring training with Mike Napoli and Jonny Gomes, and as the Red Sox kept winning — despite all predictions to the contrary — most of the team got on board with the beards.&quot; By the beginning of the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, only pitcher Koji Uehara was without facial hair. However, in the past, he did have a beard. Fans all over joined the team in solidarity as good luck to win the 2013 World Series. On October 23, 2013, &quot;Business Insider&quot; posted pictures of the Red Sox players with and without their good luck charms. An additional superstition for the team came during the season and post-season: when a player scores an especially important run, at the end of the game a tug would be given to this player&#x27;s beard.

===Basketball===
* Cleveland Cavaliers center Zydrunas Ilgauskas wore a playoff beard in 2006, but did not bring it back for the 2007 playoffs, citing spousal disapproval.
* In a variant of the playoff beard, the Dallas Mavericks stopped shaving during the 2012–13 regular season until the team reached a .500 winning percentage (achieved in mid-April).

===Tennis===
* Starting in the late 1970s, five-time Wimbledon champion Björn Borg used to let his beard grow prior to that particular tournament. Referring to that custom, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; published an article about Borg shortly before the 1981 Wimbledon tournament titled, &quot;The beard has begun.&quot;

===Motorsport===
* An October 2014 skit shows Team Penske personnel growing &quot;Chase beards&quot;, including female staff.

==Fan beards==
Fans often grow beards as a sign of support while their favorite team is in the playoffs.
* In 2006, the NPR show &quot;Weekend America&quot; featured a segment about St. Louis Cardinals fans who grew beards during the playoffs. Several Cardinals players grew beards as well.

==Outside of sports==
* Male students at some universities in the United States, Canada, Sweden and New Zealand have also begun to sport an academic variation on the playoff beard - not shaving between the period when regular classes end and their final exam.
* in 1960, partly to distance themselves from non-contributing teammate Aad van Wijngaarden (known for taking credit for the work of others), scientists Edsger W. Dijkstra and Jaap Zonneveld agreed to not shave until they completed the Electrologica ALGOL 60 compiler.

==Other playoff hair==
* During the 2010 playoffs, Patrick Kane of the Chicago Blackhawks chose to style his hair into a &quot;playoff mullet&quot; in addition to growing a playoff beard. He did it because of his struggles to grow a beard the year before. He has continued this throughout his career including the Chicago Blackhawks&#x27; 2013 and 2015 Championships. 
* In the 2008 NHL Playoffs some of the Calgary Flames, including Craig Conroy, David Moss, Dustin Boyd and Jarome Iginla, got &quot;faux-hawk&quot; haircuts.

<text>George Reggie &quot;Little George&quot; Amick (October 24, 1924 – April 4, 1959) was an American racecar driver, mainly competing in the American National Championship. He was killed in a crash in a USAC race at Daytona International Speedway.

==Racing career==
Amick began racing in jalopies in the Northwestern United States before switching to midget car racing. He competed in USAC National midgets for three seasons, finishing in the top ten points each season, and won 16 feature races. He totaled 38 wins including the 1957 Turkey Night Grand Prix.

He moved to Indy cars and won three times in 43 starts. In his rookie appearance at the Indianapolis 500 in 1958, Amick was assigned a &quot;lay-down&quot; roadster commissioned by car owner Norm Demler, designed by Quin Epperly, and based upon George Salih&#x27;s 1957 race-winning design. Amick found himself running a comfortable second to leader Jimmy Bryan with just 20 laps remaining. Demler and his team felt Amick was in a position to catch Bryan and perhaps even win, but decided against pushing their rookie driver into a potentially fatal mistake, and Amick came home an easy second. He was named the 1958 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year.

==Death==
Amick was competing in the only Indy Car race ever run at the Daytona International Speedway and was killed in an accident on the final lap.
He is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.

==Awards==
Amick was inducted into the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame in 2009.

<text>.kr is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Republic of Korea (South Korea). Registrations are processed via registration agents.

== History ==
From September 2006, it became possible to register domain names directly under .kr (although this is currently only possible for internationalized domain names). 

Trademark holders and public bodies benefited from an &quot;early registration period&quot;, after which the owners of .kr third-level domains had priority to get the corresponding second-level domains.

In 2011 a new top-level domain was registered for South Korea, intended for domain names in the local language. The top-level domain is domain names and working sites became active during 2011.

<text>.ky is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Cayman Islands. The code was chosen as other possible options had already been allocated. Registration was limited to residents and registered companies in the Cayman Islands with a local address, but this restriction was removed in September 2015. The Cayman Islands also has the international three-letter code CYM and has won a bid to be awarded the .cym domain in a future expansion of the top-level domain space.

==Second level domains==
Registrations are permitted directly at the second level, or at the third level beneath these names:

* com.ky
* org.ky
* net.ky
* edu.ky (restricted to educational institutions)
* gov.ky (restricted to governmental entities)

== History ==
IANA received a request to establish the .ky ccTLD in April 1995. From 1995 to 2002, the .ky ccTLD registry was operated by an individual, Clint Mole, initially as an employee of the Cayman Islands government, but then later under contract with a company Domain Name Trust (DNT). In 2002, the Cayman Islands government established the Information and Communications Technical Authority (ICTA) and contacted ICANN requesting that administrative operation be changed to ICTA. In June 2003, IANA and ICANN concluded that the .ky ccTLD should be redelegated to ICTA.

In January 2015 the Cayman Islands ICTA announced a partnership with Uniregistry for the operation of the .ky name extension. Uniregistry became the exclusive accredited registrar to retail .ky names on 2 March 2015.

In February 2020 GoDaddy announced that it had acquired Uniregistry&#x27;s registrar business and with it the exclusive .ky deal.

== Identity ==
=== Logo ===
The logo was designed by Darren Cornwell and approved on 17 December 2014 as Uniregistry took on the .ky namespace. It&#x27;s a representation of the islands based on their geographical dimensions (the largest island being Grand Cayman, the next being Cayman Brac and finally Little Cayman). The blue was chosen to represent the sea that surrounds the islands.

<text>.so is the internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Somalia. After a long absence, the .so domain was officially relaunched on November 1, 2010, by .SO Registry, which is regulated by the nation&#x27;s Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. It was launched through various accredited registrars around the world.

On 11 July 2013 the ISO 3166-1 code for Somalia changed to reflect the SO used for the ccTLD.

On July 8, 2015, the .so ccTLD registry was transferred to the Somali Network Information Center (SONIC), which introduced new limitations on purchasing .so domain names by persons and organizations not affiliated with Somalia. As a result, several registrars suspended the registration of new .so domain names.

On March 9, 2018, Somalia&#x27;s newly established telecom regulator The National Communications Authority (NCA) took full control of the country&#x27;s top-level internet domain (dotSO) from the Somali National Information Center (SONIC) and Cloudy Registry, who ran the operations and the management of the domain Registry.

==History==

===Overview===
Due to the civil war in Somalia, operations of this domain were previously officially delegated to Monolith Innovation Group, a company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which is now defunct. The domain remained delegated to this company, even though it was defunct, until April 17, 2009, at which time the .so domain record was changed in the root zone to point to the servers of the new registry operator, the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications in Somalia.

===The demise of Monolith (ml.org)===
Monolith Innovations, as a domain name server, was popular in the mid-1990s.

Second-level domain registrations at the time were (by modern standards) relatively expensive. Monolith operated various projects which allowed small sites to obtain an Internet address of the form &quot;example.ml.org&quot; at effectively no cost instead of paying full price ($50US in the first year) for a domain like &quot;example.com&quot;, &quot;example.org&quot; or &quot;example.net&quot; 

The domain name record for .so was initially created on 28 August 1997, at or near the peak of the ml.org service&#x27;s popularity. At the time, the potential benefits seemed more than apparent. By taking responsibility for a country code domain, Monolith could have become able to issue *.so domains at second-level for little or no cost, providing a viable alternative to the higher Network Solutions pricing of that era.

According to ml.org&#x27;s founder, Aveek Datta, in 1998, &quot;I&#x27;ve personally been trying to create a global FREE top level domain. Whether or not this becomes a reality is another question; money talks and big bucks are being waved about in the registry battles.&quot;
However, the ml.org service ceased operations at the end of 1998 due to &quot;technical and organisational problems&quot; which included major server failures. Its second-level domains remain registered to Aveek Datta, president of the former Monolith Innovations Group, but appear not to be in active use.
Throughout the domain&#x27;s history, a one-page placeholder site at the nic.so address claimed that &quot;no .SO domains are available and we are not looking for any registrar partners.&quot;

However, the DNS servers for the domain name were badly configured, so the nic.so address was only available intermittently.

===Relaunch===
On February 3, 2009, ICANN approved redelegation of the .so domain to the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications of the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia. In ICANN&#x27;s meeting minutes, it was revealed that Aveek Datta, the former registry operator, had disputed the redelegation request but he did not respond to ICANN&#x27;s request to verify his connection with the former company.

The new registry operator relaunched the .so domain on November 1, 2010. Requests to become a registrar can already be submitted using the recently launched website of .SO Registry.

===Transfer===
On July 8, 2015, the .so ccTLD registry was transferred to the Somali Network Information Center (SONIC).
On March 9, 2018, Somalia&#x27;s newly established telecom regulator, the National Communications Authority (NCA) took control of the domain name from SONIC and Cloudy Registry, who ran the operations and the management of the domain Registry. Somaliland banned use of this TLD as a result of the 2018 transfer.

==Name spaces==
The .so domain currently offers thirteen namespaces: the second-level-space &quot;.so&quot; is intended for general purpose usage, and the third-level-space &quot;.com.so&quot;, &quot;.me.so&quot;, &quot;.net.so&quot; and &quot;.org.so&quot; are set aside for commercial entities, individuals, networks, and not-for-profit organisations, respectively. There also exists &quot;.edu.so&quot; for higher education institutions; &quot;.gov.so&quot; for government entities; &quot;.sch.so&quot; for schools; and &quot;.gm.so&quot;, &quot;.hs.so&quot;, &quot;.jl.so&quot;, &quot;.pl.so&quot;, and &quot;.sw.so&quot; for Galmudug, Hirshabelle, Jubbaland, Puntland, and South West states respectively.

==Registrars==
SONIC maintains a list of officially accredited local and international registrars.

<text>Willard Saulsbury Holland (December 18, 1907 – May 20, 1984) was an American racing driver from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He won the Indianapolis 500 in 1949 and finished second in 1947, 1948, and 1950. He was runner-up in the 1947 American Automobile Association (AAA) National Championship.

== Background ==

Holland was born on December 18, 1907, the son of fireman and former professional baseball player Willard Holland. He was excellent at skating and tried out for the 1932 Olympics.

== Driving career ==

=== Early career ===

Holland began achieving notable results in big cars during 1937. He recorded his first win on July 30, 1938, at Mineola, New York. He won three times in 1939 and nine times in 1940. Holland finished second to Joie Chitwood in the 1940 AAA Eastern Big Car championship and he won the championship in 1941. No racing happened in the United States between 1942 and 1945 due to World War II.

In 1946, Holland won 15 Eastern and 1 Midwestern &quot;big car&quot; (now sprint car) races to finish fourth in the AAA national championship. On July 20, 1946, Holland won the first race at Selinsgrove Speedway in an American Automobile Association-sanctioned event.

=== Championship car career ===

Holland nearly won the 1947 Indianapolis 500 as a rookie, but slowed and allowed teammate Mauri Rose to pass him seven laps from the end, mistakenly believing that Rose was a lap down.

In 1949 Holland led late in the race when Rose (still teammate to Holland on Lou Moore&#x27;s Blue Crown Spark Plug team) began to slowly close on Holland. Moore saw what was happening out on the track and hung out a pit board ordering both drivers to hold their respective positions to the finish. Rose picked up the pace, closing on Holland. But with eight laps to go, Rose suffered a magneto failure and Holland cruised to the victory. When Rose returned to the pits, Moore fired Rose on the spot. 1950 saw him a lap down on lap 138 in second place to Johnnie Parsons when rain fell and ended the race.

On November 14, 1951, Holland was suspended from AAA Indy Car racing for one year after competing in a three-lap Lion&#x27;s Charity race at Opa-locka, Florida which was a NASCAR event. The American Automobile Association, at the time the sanctioning body for Indy car races, had a strict rule forbidding its drivers from participating in any races other than their own and would blacklist violators. He returned to Indy car racing in 1953.

Holland raced until 1965. He is believed to have achieved more than 40 sprint car feature wins and 150 podiums.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Holland participated in two World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. He finished in the top three once, and scored six World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

== Life after racing and death ==

Holland and his wife Myra ran skating rinks in Bridgeport, Connecticut. They lived briefly in Colorado Springs, Colorado before moving to Tucson, Arizona in the early 1970s.

Holland was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in November 1983 and died from complications of the disease on May 20, 1984. He had remained active throughout his life and would regularly ride a bicycle for 50 miles per day until a year before his death.

== Awards and honors ==

Holland has been inducted into the following halls of fame:
* Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1992)
* National Sprint Car Hall of Fame (2005)

In addition, the inaugural USAC Silver Crown Series race held at Selinsgrove Speedway was named the Bill Holland Classic. The race was 74 laps long as it was the 74th year after Holland&#x27;s victory opened the track.

== Motorsports career results ==

=== AAA Championship Car results ===
* 1946 table only includes results of the six races run to &quot;championship car&quot; specifications. Points total includes the 71 races run to &quot;big car&quot; specifications. Holland did not compete in any championship car events, however, he competed in no less than 41 &quot;big car&quot; events, winning 17. These efforts enabled Holland to finish the anomalous 1946 season ranked fourth in points.

=== Indianapolis 500 results ===

*Although Holland started the 1947 race from the middle of the third row, he posted the fastest qualifying time.

<text>Art Cross (January 24, 1918 – April 15, 2005) was an American racecar driver. He was the first recipient of the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year Award in 1952.

==Racing career==
Cross began racing midget cars in 1938. He served as a tank commander during the Second World War, and received a Purple Heart for his wounds during the Battle of the Bulge. He returned to midget cars after the war, and raced in one of Pappy Hough&#x27;s &quot;Little Iron Pigs.&quot;

Cross won the first Indy 500 Rookie of the Year award after a fifth-place finish in the 1952 Indianapolis 500. Cross used his share of $27,000 from the race to purchase a farm near LaPorte, Indiana.

He finished second in the 1953 Indianapolis 500 behind Bill Vukovich. Despite it being one of the hottest Indy 500s on record, Vukovich and Cross completed the entire race without relief. Driver Carl Scarborough died from the heat. Cross&#x27; car was the &quot;Springfield Welding Special&quot;, which was owned by Bessie Lee Paoli, who was the only female owner at the time.

After retiring from racing, he turned his attention to running the farm in LaPorte, Indiana. He later became involved in a heavy equipment business and in construction. He was inducted in the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame in 1992.

<doc id="1236266" wikidata="Q25916" url="?curid=1236266" title="Muridae">
<text>The Muridae, or murids, are either the largest or second-largest family of rodents and of mammals, containing approximately 870 species, including many species of mice, rats, and gerbils found naturally throughout Eurasia, Africa, and Australia.

The name Muridae comes from the Latin &#x27; (genitive&#x27;), meaning &quot;mouse&quot;, since all true mice belong to the family, with the more typical mice belonging to the genus &quot;Mus&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Murids are found nearly everywhere in the world, though many subfamilies have narrower ranges. Murids are not found in Antarctica or many oceanic islands. Although none of them are native to the Americas, a few species, notably the house mouse and black rat, have been introduced worldwide. Murids occupy a broad range of ecosystems from tropical forests to tundras. Fossorial, arboreal, and semiaquatic murid species occur, though most are terrestrial animals. The extensive list of niches filled by murids helps to explain their relative abundance.

== Diet and dentition ==
A broad range of feeding habits is found in murids, ranging from herbivorous and omnivorous species to specialists that consume strictly earthworms, certain species of fungi, or aquatic insects. Most genera consume plant matter and small invertebrates, often storing seeds and other plant matter for winter consumption. Murids have sciurognathous jaws (an ancestral character in rodents) and a diastema is present. Murids lack canines and premolars. Generally, three molars (though sometimes only one or two) are found, and the nature of the molars varies by genus and feeding habit.

== Reproduction ==
Some murids are highly social, while others are solitary. Females commonly produce several litters annually. In warm regions, breeding may occur year-round. Though the lifespans of most genera are generally less than two years, murids have high reproductive potential and their populations tend to increase rapidly and then drastically decline when food resources have been exhausted. This is often seen in a three- to four-year cycle.

==Characteristics==
The murids are small mammals, typically around long excluding the tail, but ranging from in the African pygmy mouse to in the northern Luzon giant cloud rat. They typically have slender bodies with scaled tails longer than the body, and pointed snouts with prominent whiskers, but with wide variation in these broad traits. Some murids have elongated legs and feet to allow them to move with a hopping motion, while others have broad feet and prehensile tails to improve their climbing ability, and yet others have neither adaptation. They are most commonly some shade of brown in color, although many have black, grey, or white markings.

Murids generally have excellent senses of hearing and smell. They live in a wide range of habitats from forest to grassland, and mountain ranges. A number of species, especially the gerbils, are adapted to desert conditions and can survive for a long time with minimal water. They consume a wide range of foods depending on the species, with the aid of powerful jaw muscles and gnawing incisors that grow throughout life. The dental formula of murids is .

Murids breed frequently, often producing large litters several times per year. They typically give birth between twenty and forty days after mating, although this varies greatly between species. The young are typically born blind, hairless, and helpless, although exceptions occur, such as in spiny mice.

==Evolution==
As with many other small mammals, the evolution of the murids is not well known, as few fossils survive. They probably evolved from hamster-like animals in tropical Asia some time in the early Miocene, and have only subsequently produced species capable of surviving in cooler climates. They have become especially common worldwide during the current geological epoch, as a result of hitching a ride commensally with human migrations.

==Classification==
The murids are classified in five subfamilies, around 150 genera, and about 834 species.

===Subfamilies===
Source:
*Deomyinae (spiny mice, brush furred mice, link rat)
*Gerbillinae (gerbils, jirds and sand rats)
*Leimacomyinae (Togo mouse)
*Lophiomyinae (maned rat or crested rat)
*Murinae (Old World rats and mice, including vlei rats)

==In literature==

Murids feature in literature, including folk tales and fairy stories. In the &quot;Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot;, retold in many versions since the 14th century, including one by the Brothers Grimm, a rat-catcher lures the town&#x27;s rats into the river, but the mayor refuses to pay him. In revenge, the rat-catcher lures away all the children of the town, never to return. Mice feature in some of Beatrix Potter&#x27;s small books, including &quot;The Tale of Two Bad Mice&quot; (1904), &quot;The Tale of Mrs Tittlemouse&quot; (1910), &quot;The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse&quot; (1918), and &quot;The Tailor of Gloucester&quot; (1903), which last was described by J. R. R. Tolkien as perhaps the nearest to his idea of a fairy story, the rest being &quot;beast-fables&quot;. Among Aesop&#x27;s Fables are &quot;The Cat and the Mice&quot; and &quot;The Frog and the Mouse&quot;. In James Herbert&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Rats&quot;, (1974), a vagrant is attacked and eaten alive by a pack of giant rats; further attacks follow.

<doc id="1236270" wikidata="Q549649" url="?curid=1236270" title="Il Cannone Guarnerius">
<text>Il Cannone Guarnerius of 1743 is a violin created by the Italian luthier Giuseppe Bartolomeo Guarneri of Cremona (1698–1744).

Il Cannone is also known by the variants &quot;Il Cannone del Gesù&quot;, and the &quot;Cannon&quot;, often appended with &quot;Guarneri del Gesù&quot;, the Guarneri trademark. The violin received its name from a former owner, the Italian violin virtuoso Niccolò Paganini (1782–1840), because of its power and resonance. So associated is Paganini with &quot;Il Cannone&quot; that it is common for the violin to be referenced as &quot;Il Cannone, ex Paganini&quot;.

Paganini lost a valuable Antonio Amati violin as a result of his penchant for voracious gambling. He was given a neglected Guarneri violin, a gift from an amateur violinist and businessman. Paganini played on this instrument for the rest of his life, fondly calling it “my cannon violin,” referring to the explosive sound that he was able to make it produce. He bequeathed it to the city of Genoa, Italy upon his death, and it is now considered a national treasure.

When in need of repair, &quot;Il Cannone&quot; would be sent to the Paris workshop of Jean Baptiste Vuillaume (1798–1875), the greatest luthier of his day. Not only did Vuillaume repair the Guarnerius, but he also made an exact replica. The copy was so exact, that not even Paganini could distinguish one from the other. It was not until Paganini noticed subtle differences in tone that he could identify the original. Paganini presented the copy to his only student, Camillo Sivori, who would later bequeath the instrument to the Municipality of Genoa, where it now is exhibited with the original &quot;Il Cannone&quot;.

&quot;Il Cannone&quot; is exhibited alongside other Paganini memorabilia within the Paganini room of the Palazzo Doria-Tursi, the Genoa town hall. The original violin is maintained in playable condition, and is taken out and played monthly by its curator. The &quot;Cannone&quot; was played each year by the winner of the Premio Paganini contest for young violinists, which sees the Italian city attracting the cream of the crop of young violin performers (since 2002 the contest has been held every two years). On occasion, &quot;Il Cannone&quot; is loaned to musicians for performance. In 1996, violinist Eduard Schmieder was invited and gave a recital on &quot;Il Cannone&quot; in Genoa at the Palazzo Ducale for the audience of 2000 (with pianist Valentina Lisitsa); on this rare occasion, a posthumous International Peace Prize ceremony was given by the Italian government to Yitzhak Rabin. Violinist Shlomo Mintz performed a special &quot;Il Cannone&quot; concert on Paganini&#x27;s violin with the Limburg Symphony Orchestra of the Netherlands, in 1997. In 1999, Eugene Fodor played &quot;Il Cannone&quot; at a special concert in San Francisco, California, USA. It was the farthest the violin had ever been from Italy. Conditions of its travel included a multi-million US dollar insurance policy and an armed escort of Italian police officers. The violin has been played several times by jazz violinist Regina Carter, who recorded an entire album with it, &quot;&quot;. In February 2006, &quot;Il Cannone&quot; was taken to London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Music, where it was displayed and played at a festival devoted to Paganini. 

The violin was the subject of the 2017 documentary &quot;Strad Style&quot;, in which director Stefan Avalos follows manic-depressive violin maker Daniel Houck in his dilapidated rural Ohio farm as he makes an &quot;Il Cannone&quot; replica for Razvan Stoica.

In 2019, the violin journeyed to Columbus, Ohio, for a one-week display at the Columbus Museum of Art under the auspices of the Columbus-Genoa sister cities relationship. Columbus Symphony concertmaster Joanna Frankel performed a single concert on the instrument.

Italian violinist Francesca Dego recorded an album of Paganini-themed music with &quot;Cannone&quot; in 2019.

<text>Diterpenes are a class of terpenes composed of four isoprene units, often with the molecular formula C20H32. They are biosynthesized by plants, animals and fungi via the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate being a primary intermediate. Diterpenes form the basis for biologically important compounds such as retinol, retinal, and phytol. Some diterpenes are known to be antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory.

As with most terpenes a huge number of potential structures exists, which may be broadly divided according to the number of rings present.

== Biosynthesis==
Diterpenes are derived from the addition of one IPP unit to FPP to form geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). From GGPP, structural diversity is achieved mainly by two classes of enzymes; the diterpene synthases and cytochromes P450. Several diterpenes are produced by plants and cyanobacteria. GGPP is also the precursor for the synthesis of the phytane by the action of the enzyme geranylgeranyl reductase. This compound is used for the biosynthesis of tocopherols and the phytyl functional group is used in the formation of chlorophyll &quot;a&quot;, ubiquinones, plastoquinone and phylloquinone.

==Diterpenoids==
Diterpenes are formally defined as being hydrocarbons and thus contain no heteroatoms. Functionalized structures should instead be called diterpenoids, although in scientific literature the two terms are often used interchangeably. Although a wide range of terpene structures exist, few of them are biologically significant; by contrast, diterpenoids possess a rich pharmacology and include important compounds such as retinol, phytol or taxadiene. 

===Taxanes===
Taxanes are class of diterpenoids featuring a taxadiene core. They are produced by plants of the genus &quot;Taxus&quot; (yew trees) and are widely used as chemotherapy agents.

==Other==
* &quot;Dodonaea petiolaris&quot; yields the diterpene &quot;ent&quot;-3β-acetoxy-15,16-epoxylabda-8(17),13(16),14-trien-18-oic acid (C22H28O6) or its enantiomer.
* &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot; yields Salvinorin A, a psychotropic drug

<text>Swat District (, , ), also known as the Swat Valley, is a district in the Malakand Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Known for its stunning natural beauty, the district is a popular tourist destination. With a population of 2,687,384 per the 2023 national census, Swat is the 15th-largest district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Swat District is centred on the Valley of Swat, usually referred to simply as Swat, which is a natural geographic region surrounding the Swat River. The valley was a major centre of early Buddhism of the ancient civilisation of Gandhara, mainly Gandharan Buddhism, with pockets of Buddhism persisting in the valley until the 16th century conquest of Swat by the Yousafzais, after which the area became largely Muslim, along with the Pashtunization of Swat and its neighbouring regions.
In the early 19th century, Swat emerged as an independent state under Saidu Baba. State of Swat became a Princely state under British suzerainty as part of the British Raj in 1918.

In 1947, following the Partition of British India and subsequent independence of Pakistan, Swat acceded to the Dominion of Pakistan continuing as a self-governing princely state until it was officially annexed and merged into West Pakistan and later became a part of North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) in 1969. The region was seized by the Tehrik-i-Taliban in late-2007 until Pakistani control was re-established in mid-2009.

The average elevation of Swat is , resulting in a considerably cooler and wetter climate compared to the rest of Pakistan. With lush forests, verdant alpine meadows, and snow-capped mountains, Swat is one of the country&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Swat&quot; is derived from the Swat River. The Swat River referred to as the &quot;Suvāstu&quot; in the Rig Veda, with a literal meaning &quot;of fair dwellings&quot;. 
Some have suggested the Sanskrit name may mean &quot;clear blue water.&quot; Another theory derives the word Swat from the Sanskrit word &quot;shveta&quot; (), also used to describe the clear water of the Swat River. To the ancient Greeks, the river was known as the &quot;Soastus.&quot; The Chinese pilgrim Faxian referred to Swat as the &quot;Su-ho-to&quot;.

== Geography ==

Swat&#x27;s total area is . Swat District consists of two well-defined geographic regions, Swat Kohistan and Swat Proper. Swat Kohistan forms the larger, northern part of the district, and is mainly inhabited by the indigenous Kohistani, Torwali and Kalami peoples. Swat Proper forms the lower portion of the district and has a Pashtun majority, with a significant Gujar population.
In terms of administrative divisions, Swat is surrounded by Chitral, Upper Dir and Lower Dir to the west, Gilgit-Baltistan to the north, and Kohistan, Buner and Shangla to the east and southeast, respectively. The former tehsil of Buner was granted the status of a separate district in 1991.

The Swat Valley is enclosed by mountains that forms a natural geographic boundary for it. The Swat River whose headwaters arise in the Hindu Kush mountain range runs through the length of the region. The main area consists of many sub valleys such as Kalam, Bahrain, Matiltan, Utror, and Gabral.

=== Valley ===
The Valley of Swat is delineated by natural geographic boundaries, and is centered on the Swat River. The valley is enclosed on all sides by mountains, and is intersected by glens and ravines. Above mountains ridges to the west is the valley of the Panjkora River, to the north the Gilgit Valley, and Indus River gorges to the east. To the south, across a series of low mountains, lies the wide Peshawar valley.

The northernmost area of Swat district are the high valleys and alpine meadows of &quot;Swat Kohistan (Swat Mountains)&quot;, a region where numerous glaciers feed the Usho, and Gabral rivers (also known as the Utrar River), which form a confluence at Kalam, and thereafter forms the Swat river - which forms the spine of the Swat Valley and district. Swat then is characterized by thick forests along the narrow gorges of the Kalam Valley until the city of Madyan. From there, the river courses gently for 160 km through the wider Yousufzai Plains of the lower Swat Valley until Chakdara.

=== Climate ===
Climate in Swat is a function of altitude, with mountains in the Kohistan region snow-clad year round. The upper areas of the region are relatively colder and often get snowfall in the winter. Drier, warmer temperatures in the lower portions in the Yousafzai Plains where summer temperatures can reach , although the lower plains experience occasional snow. Both regions are subject to two monsoon seasons - one in winter and the other in summer. Swat&#x27;s lower reaches have vegetation characterized by dry bush and deciduous trees, while the upper areas mostly have thick pine forests.

=== Airport ===
The Saidu Sharif Airport at Kanju is a stone throw from Mingora, adding much to the tourism in the past. The runway is situated between Swat River and the Sham Baba mountainous range, with lush green gardens and large trees being added as &quot;charm&quot; to the climate in the area. More than 20 km² has been covered strategically, as was proposed during the last Wali&#x27;s rule and constructed later-on by the Pakistani government. The Kanju village has seen an influx of academics in the region and is considered a hub for the Matta and Kabal Tehsils of Swat Valley.

== History ==
=== Ancient ===
The Gandhara grave culture that emerged &quot;c.&quot; 1400 BCE and lasted until 800 BCE, and named for their distinct funerary practices, was found along the Middle Swat River course. Swat, then known as Oddiyana, was a major centre of Gandhara civilization. In 327 BCE, Alexander the Great fought his way to Odigram and Barikot and stormed their battlements; in Greek accounts, these towns are identified as &quot;Ora&quot; and &quot;Bazira&quot;. After the Alexandrian invasion of Swat, and adjacent regions of Buner, control of the wider Gandhara region was handed to Seleucus I Nicator.
In 305 BCE, the Mauryan Emperor conquered the wider region from the Greeks, and probably established control of Swat, until their control of the region ceased around 187 BCE. It was during the rule of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka that Buddhism was introduced into Swat, and some of the earliest stupas built in the region. Following collapse of Mauryan rule, Swat came under control of the Greco-Bactrians, and briefly the Scythians of the Central Asian Steppe.

The region of Gandhara (based in the Peshawar valley and the adjacent hilly regions of Swat, Buner, Dir, and Bajaur), broke away from Greco-Bactrian rule to establish their own independence as the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Following the death of the most famous Indo-Greek king, Menander I around 140 BCE, the region was overrun by the Indo-Scythians, and then the Persian Parthian Empire around 50 CE. The arrival of the Parthians began the long tradition of Greco-Buddhist art, which was a syncretic form of art combining Buddhist imagery with heavy Hellenistic-Greek influences. This art form is credited with having the first representations of the Buddha in human form, rather than symbolically.

The Parthians were ousted from Swat by the Kushans, based in the Peshawar valley. Kushan rule began what is considered by many to be the golden age of Gandhara. Under the greatest Kushan king, Kanishka, Swat became an important region for the production of Buddhist art, and numerous Buddhists shrines were built in the area. As a patron of Mahayana Buddhism, new Buddhists &quot;stupas&quot; were built and old ones were enlarged. The Chinese pilgrim Fa-Hsien, who visited the valley around 403 CE, mentions 500 monasteries.

=== Medieval ===

Swat and the wider region of Gandhara were overrun by the Alchon Huns around about 465 CE. Under the rule of Mihirakula, Buddhism was suppressed as he himself became virulently anti-Buddhist after a perceived slight against him by a Buddhist monk. Under his rule, Buddhist monks were reportedly killed, and Buddhist shrines attacked. He himself appears to have been inclined towards the Shaivism sect of Hinduism.

In around 520 CE, the Chinese monk Song Yun visited the area, and recorded that area had been in ruin and ruled by a leader that did not practice the laws of the Buddha. The Tang-era Chinese monk Xuanzang recorded the decline of Buddhism in the region, and ascendance of Hinduism in the region. According to him, of the 1400 monasteries that had supposedly been there, most were in ruins or had been abandoned.
Following the collapse of Buddhism in Swat following the Alchon Hun invasion, Swat was ruled by the Hindu Shahi dynasty beginning in the 8th century, who made their capital at Udigram in lower Swat. The Hindu Shahis are believed to belong to the Uḍi/Oḍi tribe, namely the people of Oddiyana, present-day Swat.

The Shahis built an extensive array of temples and other architectural buildings, of which ruins remain today. Under their rule, Hinduism ascended, and Sanskrit is believed to have been the lingua franca of the locals during this time. By the time of the Muslim conquests (), the population in the region was predominantly Hindu, though Buddhism persisting in the valley until the 10th century, after which the area became largely Muslim. Hindu Shahi rulers built fortresses to guard and tax the commerce through this area, and ruins dating back to their rule can be seen on the hills at the southern entrance of Swat, at the Malakand Pass.

Around 1001 CE, the last Hindu Shahi king, Jayapala was decisively defeated at the Battle of Peshawar (1001) by Mahmud of Ghazni, thereby ending 2 centuries of Hindu rule over Gandhara. The Sultanate of Swat was the last Dardic state that existed in the Swat valley between 12th and 16th centuries. It was conquered by the Yousafzai Pashtuns from west during the reign of Sultan Awes Jahangiri in 1519, resulting into the Pashtunization of Swat.

===Modern===
The princely state of Swat was a kingdom established in the late 19th century by the Muslim saint Akhund Abdul Gaffur, more commonly known as &quot;Saidu Baba,&quot; that was ruled by chiefs known as Akhunds. It was then recognized as a princely state in alliance with the British Indian Empire between 1926 and 1947, after which the Akhwand acceded to the newly independent state of Pakistan. Swat continued to exist as an autonomous region until it was dissolved in 1969, and incorporated into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (formerly called NWFP).

The region was seized by the Pakistani Taliban in late-2007, and its highly-popular tourist industry was subsequently decimated until Pakistani control was re-established in mid-2009 after a month-long military campaign launched by the Pakistan Army. During their occupation, the group attacked Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai in 2012, who at the time was a young school-girl who wrote a blog for BBC Urdu detailing life under Tehreek-i-Taliban rule, and their curb on girls&#x27; education.

Kushan-era Buddhist stupas and statues in the Swat Valley were demolished by the Tehreek-i-Taliban, and the Jehanabad Buddha&#x27;s face was blown up using dynamite, but was repaired by a group of Italian restorers in a nine-year-long process. Looters subsequently destroyed many of Pakistan&#x27;s Buddhist artifacts, and deliberately targeted Gandhara Buddhist relics for destruction. Gandhara artifacts remaining from the demolitions were thereafter plundered by thieves and smugglers.

== Economy ==
Approximately 38% of economy of Swat depends on tourism and 31% depends on agriculture.

=== Agriculture ===
Gwalerai, a village located near Mingora, is one of those few villages which produces 18 varieties of apples due to its agriculturally favourable temperate climate in summer. The apple produced here is consumed in Pakistan as well as exported to other countries. It is known as ‘the apple of Swat’.
Swat is also famous for peach production mostly grown in the valley bottom plains and accounts for about 80% of the peach production of the country - thus oft marketed in the national markets with a branded as &quot;Swat Peaches&quot;. The supply starts in April and continues till September because of a diverse range of varieties grown. Salampur village, located near Saidu Sharif, is a principle region in Pakistan for the manufacture of sheets and shawls.

== Demographics ==


As of the 2023 census, Swat district has 381,212 households and a population of 2,687,384. The district has a sex ratio of 104.83 males to 100 females and a literacy rate of 48.13%: 61.83% for males and 33.95% for females. 808,888 (30.11% of the surveyed population) are under 10 years of age. 794,368 (29.56%) live in urban areas.

Swat is mostly inhabited by Pashtuns who make up 92.18% of the population. The dominant tribe is the Yusufzai tribe with minor settlements of Shinwari, Tarkani, Ghoryakhel and Sulaimankhel tribes. The language spoken in the valley is Pashto (mainly the Yousafzai dialect). Kohistani languages are spoken by 1.47% of the population and languages classified as &#x27;Others&#x27;, mainly Kalami and Torwali, are spoken by 6.10% of the population, and form the majority in the Swat Kohistan region of Upper Swat.

== Education ==
According to the &quot;Alif Ailaan Pakistan Education Rankings for 2017&quot;, Swat with a score of 53.1, is ranked 86 out of 155 districts in terms of education. Furthermore, the Swat schools infrastructure scores 90.26 which ranks it on number 31 out of 155.

== Administrative divisions ==
Swat is subdivided into 9 administrative divisions Tehsils:

#Kalam
#Behrain
#Matta (Sub-tehsils: Matta Sebujni, Matta Shamizai)
#Khwaza Khela
#Charbagh
#Babuzai (Sub-tehsil: Saidu Sharif)
#Mingora
#Kabal
#Barikot

Each tehsil comprises certain numbers of union councils. Swat has 65 union councils: 56 rural and 9 urban.

According to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Act, 2013, a new &quot;local governments&quot; system was introduced, in which Swat is included. This system has 67 wards, in which the total amount of village councils are around 170, while neighbourhood councils number around 44.

=== Politics ===
The region elects three male members of the National Assembly of Pakistan (MNAs), one female MNA, seven male members of the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (MPAs) and two female MPAs. In the 2002 National and Provincial elections, the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), an alliance of religious political parties, won all the seats.

<text>.kz is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Kazakhstan.

Registrations can be made directly at the second level or at the third level beneath categories which have specific restrictions, and are generally limited to Kazakhstan-related entities.

== .kz ==

=== Second-level domains ===

* .com.kz – Commercial organizations; registered trademark protection.
* .edu.kz – Licensed educational organizations.
* .gov.kz – Governmental organizations.
* .mil.kz – Ministry of Defense.
* .net.kz – Licensed networks of data communications.
* .org.kz – Nonprofit organizations.

==== Enforcement of Internet resources on hardware and software complexes ====
In March 2018, new Rules went into effect and since at least 2021, these rules are being enforced. Especially Rule 16 subsection 6 is being enforced:

:&quot;16. Use of a domain name in the space of the Kazakhstan segment of the Internet is suspended when:&quot;
:: 6) placement of Internet resources on hardware and software complexes outside territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

::Footnote. Point 16 in the editorial office order of the Minister of Digital Development, Innovations and Aerospace Industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan of 28.09.2020 No. 354/HҚ (put into effect upon expiry of ten calendar days after the day of its first official publication).

Example: DNS for domain www.EXAMPLE.kz cannot point to a web page being hosted in a member country of the EU. In such a case, the registry for EXAMPLE.kz will be suspended a short period and then deleted.

==== Google ====
In June 2011, Google redirected all traffic from google.kz to google.com in response to a demand issued by the Kazakh Ministry of Communications and Information that requires all .kz domain names to operate on physical servers within the borders of Kazakhstan. Senior Vice President Bill Coughran said &quot;creating borders on the web raises important questions for us not only about network efficiency but also about user privacy and free expression.&quot; By hosting google.kz only on servers inside Kazakhstan, &quot;we would be helping to create a fractured Internet.&quot;

During the first half of 2017, google.kz has returned to be generally available.

== .қаз ==
A second country code top-level domain, .қаз (&quot;qaz&quot;) for Kazakhstan is now active. It is used with web addresses using Cyrillic letters. It was launched in March 2012, when the first site, a test site (тест.қаз, &quot;test.qaz&quot;), was activated.

<text>Genoa ( ) is an unincorporated town in Douglas County, Nevada, United States. Founded in 1851, it was the first settlement in what became the Nevada Territory (1861-1864). It is situated within Carson River Valley and is approximately south of Reno. The population was 939 at the 2010 census. The town is home to the state&#x27;s oldest bar, which opened in 1853.

==History==

Genoa was first settled by Mormon pioneers in what was then the Mexican territory of Alta California. The settlement originated as a trading post called Mormon Station, which served as a respite for travelers on the Carson Route of the California Trail. In June 1850, following the Mexican Cession of 1849, of territories in the modern Southwestern United States, after the Mexican-American War (1846-1848. H.S. Beatie and fellow Mormons built a roofless log enclosure and corral as a trading post near a small stream. Migrants could obtain clothing, tobacco, meat, canned goods, coffee, beans, sugar, flour and bacon. The post was abandoned later that year. By 1851, John Reese arrived in the area with horses, cattle and a dozen wagons loaded with supplies to establish a permanent trading post. By another year later in 1852, migrant traffic through the area was heavy and the settlement expanded. A post office opened, a blacksmith shop was built, and sawmills were built. In 1856, Orson Hyde changed the name of the community to Genoa, after the historic major Italian city. The originals in the Mormon settlers withdrew in 1857, when they were recalled by the Mormon patriarch and head of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and first territorial Governor of the Utah Territory (1850-1896), Brigham Young (1801-1877), in the territorial capital of Salt Lake City because of the Utah War (1857-1858). The village of Genoa served temporarily as the first capital city of the new federal Nevada Territory when it was organized on authority of the United States Congress and President of the United States in 1861, until it was moved later that year to Carson City.

Nevada Territory&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Territorial Enterprise&quot;, was founded first in Genoa in 1858 but moved to the boom town of Virginia City two years later in 1860, shortly after the silver strikes of the Comstock Lode the year before and rush of men to the diggings and mine shafts. It was also the site in animal husbandry of the first cattle ranch in Nevada.

Much of Genoa, including the original fort, station, and hotel, was destroyed in a fire in 1910, but a replica of the fort was built in 1947. Every year since 1919, Genoa has held a festival called the Candy Dance, where candy, food, and crafts are sold to support its town government. The Candy Dance is usually held during the final weekend of September. Many pioneers rest in the Genoa graveyard, including Snowshoe Thompson, his wife and his son.

A mile south of Genoa is David Walley&#x27;s Resort, a famous natural hot springs and spa. It was first built in 1862 and known as Walley&#x27;s Hot Springs.

On October 1, 1934,the infamous wanted criminal and bank robber Baby Face Nelson (1908-1934, born Lester Joseph Gillis, later a.k.a. George (&quot;Baby Face&quot;) Nelson), and members of his criminal gang arrived at Walley&#x27;s Hot Springs, hiding out for a month before returning east to Chicago, where Nelson was later shot by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), form the Chicago field office and Washington, D.C., headquarters, under famous long-serving director J. Edgar Hoover (1895-1972, served 1924-1935 / 1935-1972), in the United States Department of Justice,

Scenes from the 1973 movie &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; were filmed in Genoa, and the village was the set for the 1990 movie &quot;Misery&quot;, starring Kathy Bates, when the village doubled in size with buildings added and then removed after the filming. Food writer M. F. K. Fisher wrote a series of cookbook reviews for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; from her sister&#x27;s home in Genoa during the 1960s.

<text>Shlomo Mintz (; born 30 October 1957) is a Russian-born Israeli violinist and conductor. He regularly appears with orchestras and conductors on the international scene and is heard in recitals and chamber music concerts around the world.

== Early life==
Shlomo Mintz was born in Moscow. In 1959, when he was two, his family immigrated to Israel, where he studied with Ilona Feher, a student of Jenő Hubay. Feher introduced Shlomo Mintz to Isaac Stern, who became his mentor. He was also a student of Dorothy DeLay in New York.

==Music career==

His first performance on stage was at the age of six, and at age eleven he played as soloist with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. Soon afterward, he was called on a week&#x27;s notice by Zubin Mehta to play Paganini&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1, Op. 6, with the orchestra when Itzhak Perlman fell ill. He made his Carnegie Hall debut at the age of sixteen with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (conducted by William Steinberg).

Under the auspices of Isaac Stern and the American-Israel Cultural Foundation he started studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York and soon afterward at the age of 18, he made an extensive tour through Europe. He also signed, still in his early twenties, a long-term recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon and was invited by Berlin, Vienna, Concertgebouw, Chicago, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Philadelphia and New York Philharmonic Orchestras frequently.

He has collaborated with Isaac Stern, Mstislav Rostropovich, Pinchas Zukerman, Itzhak Perlman, Zubin Mehta, Claudio Abbado, Carlo Maria Giulini, Antal Dorati, Erich Leinsdorf, Eugene Ormandy, Riccardo Muti, Yuri Temirkanov, Ida Haendel and Ivry Gitlis.

==Conductor and artistic director==
At the age of eighteen, Mintz launched a parallel career as a conductor, and has since led acclaimed orchestras worldwide including the Royal Philharmonic (United Kingdom), the NHK Symphony (Japan) and the Israel Philharmonic. He was music advisor of the Israel Chamber Orchestra from 1989 to 1993, and in March 1994 was appointed artistic advisor and principal guest conductor of the Maastricht Symphony in the Netherlands, which he led for some weeks during four seasons, sometimes as both conductor and violin soloist. In 2008, he became principal guest conductor of the Zagreb Philharmonic. From 2002 to 2012, he was artistic director of the Sion-Valais International Music Festival. Mintz was also the artistic director of Arena di Verona winter season and performed Mendelssohn Elijah Oratorio, as a highlight of his season.

His guest conducting appearances included orchestras like Concertgebouw Orchestra, La Scala, London Symphony Orchestra, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Rotterdam Philharmonic, Stuttgart Radio Orchestra, La Fenice, Detroit Symphony and Teatro Colón.

==Teaching career==
Mintz gives master classes worldwide, including Crans-Montana Classics, Switzerland, since summer 2012, where he is the artistic director.
He was one of the founders of the Keshet Eilon International Violin Mastercourse in Israel, an advanced-level summer program for young talented violinists from all around the world in Kibbutz Eilon, Israel, and served as a patron there for eighteen years (1992-2010).

== Additional activities ==
Mintz was a co-founder of the &quot;Violins of Hope&quot; project together with violinmaker Amnon Weinstein. Forty-five violins once owned by players who lost their lives in ghettos and concentration camps during World War II were restored by Weinstein and have been displayed internationally. The Violins of Hope were presented in a special event in Jerusalem for the sixtieth-anniversary celebration of the State of Israel.

Mintz has served as a jury member of international competitions, including the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow (1993) and the Queen Elisabeth International Music Competition in Brussels (1993 and 2001). He was also invited to be jury president of the International Henryk Wieniawski Competition (October 2001) for the Violin in Poznań, Poland. From 2002 to 2011, he was jury president of the Sion Valais-International Violin Competition in Switzerland. He is a mentor and jury president of the International Violin Competition in Buenos Aires, president of the Ilona Fehér Budapest Violin Competition, the Munetsugu Angel Violin Competition Japan and HKIVS Shlomo Mintz Beijing International Violin Competition.

==Personal life==
Mintz is married to Corina, who grew up in Italy and Germany, and worked as an interpreter specializing in art. They have two sons, Eliav and Alexander. Shlomo owned a villa in Italy and a castle in Germany but he primarily raised his family in an unpretentious, contemporary ranch in Sands Point, New York. With over 150 concerts a year, Mintz regrets not having enough time to spend with this children due to his hectic performance schedule and wished he could have spent more time “shooting nintendo with Eliav”. His children are also musically inclined, and Eliav picked up piano and viola at a young age. Although Shlomo was not around often, his wife says “it’s very special when daddy’s home”.

<text>The 1951 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s 30th term. The First National Government was re-elected, with the National Party increasing its parliamentary majority over the opposition Labour Party. This was the last time until the that a party was elected to majority government of New Zealand by receiving a majority of the vote.

==Background==
The National Party had formed its first administration after the 1949 elections, in which it had ended four terms of government by the Labour Party. The National government, with Sidney Holland as Prime Minister, had undertaken a number of economic and constitutional reforms, although it had not seriously modified the new social welfare system which Labour had introduced. Labour&#x27;s leader, Peter Fraser, had died in December 1950 after a long period of poor health, and had been replaced in January 1951 by Walter Nash. Nash had been Minister of Finance for the duration of the first Labour government.

The most significant issue in the 1951 elections was the growing industrial unrest of the time, particularly the ongoing dockworkers dispute. Holland condemned the strikers, calling the situation &quot;industrial anarchy&quot;. The Labour Party, under Nash, attempted to take a moderate position in the dispute, but ended up displeasing both sides. Holland, seeking a mandate to respond strongly to the strike, called a snap election. Another issue was high inflation, which frustrated voters and without the distraction of the strike, might have threatened Holland&#x27;s government at the scheduled election for 1952.

===MPs retiring in 1951===
Two MPs retired at the election, one each from Labour and National.

==The election==
The date for the main 1951 elections was 1 September, and for the first time, elections to the four Maori seats were held on the same day. The 1951 elections were also the first under the new regulations which required elections to be held on a Saturday. 1,205,762 people were registered to vote, and turnout was 89.1%. The number of seats being contested was 80, a number which had been fixed since 1902.

==Results==

===Party standings===
The 1951 election saw the governing National Party re-elected with a twenty-seat margin, a substantial improvement on the twelve-seat margin it previously held. National won fifty seats compared with the Labour Party&#x27;s thirty. The popular vote was closer, however, with National winning 54% to Labour&#x27;s 46%. No seats were won by minor party candidates or by independents. No party then captured a majority of the vote until the 2020 election, when Labour won 50.01%.

<text>Air Paradise International was an airline based in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia. It operated services to destinations in Australia, South Korea and Taiwan, from its main base at Ngurah Rai Airport, Denpasar. On 1 December 2005, the airline announced that it was ceasing operations due to a downturn in traffic, following terrorist bombings on the island in October 2005. In February 2007, the Indonesian Transportation Ministry delayed license revocation of 11 major airlines, including Air Paradise, to give restructuring opportunities to the operators. Air Paradise was considering re-launching services in March 2007. However, 3 years later, after ceasing operations in November 2005, the airline filed for bankruptcy, 5 months after another of its competitors (Adam Air) had filed for bankruptcy.

== History ==

The airline was established in June 2002 and started operations on 16 February 2003 with services to Perth in Australia from Denpasar, Bali. On 27 December 2004, services began to Osaka, Japan. All services were suspended on 1 December 2005 following a downturn of traffic after the October 2005 terrorist attacks in Bali which resulted in over 20 fatalities and 100 injuries. In June 2006 the website was still available, announcing negotiations to recapitalize the airline. Air Paradise was using A300s, A310s and leased 737-800s on flights to Melbourne, Sydney and Perth mostly for tourists. A major competitor on the Denpasar route was Garuda Indonesia. In November 2008, Air Paradise filed for bankruptcy after failing to re-launch operations and was the 2nd airline to file for bankruptcy in 5 months after Adam Air.

== Services ==

Air Paradise operated services to the following international scheduled destinations in January 2005: Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Osaka, Perth, Seoul and Sydney.

== Fleet ==

The Air Paradise operated the following aircraft during its operation:

<doc id="1236320" wikidata="Q231677" url="?curid=1236320" title="Jenna Haze">
<text>Jenna Haze (born 1982) is an American director, model, and former pornographic actress.

Haze has won numerous pornographic industry awards, including the 2003 AVN Award for Best New Starlet and the 2009 AVN Award for Female Performer of the Year, making her the second performer in history to ever win both awards in the course of her career, after Missy. In 2012, she was inducted into both the AVN and XRCO Halls of Fame.

== Career ==
Haze entered the adult film industry on July 18, 2001. Between 2002 and 2005, she was a contract girl for the film company Jill Kelly Productions. During most of her time at the company, she performed exclusively with women, out of loyalty to her then boyfriend, an industry cameraman. She returned to working with men in the 2006 multi-award-winning release &quot;Jenna Haze Darkside&quot;, produced by Jules Jordan.

Her first scene was for &quot;The Oral Adventures of Craven Moorehead 8&quot; with her agent Slim Shady (Dez) and his best friend, Moorehead. It was intended to only be an oral sex scene, but in the heat of the moment she had intercourse with both. The next day she shot a scene with Miles Long in Joey Silvera&#x27;s &quot;Service Animals 4&quot;.

In February 2002, Haze appeared in a scene for Jill Kelly Productions (JKP), directed by Jill Kelly herself. Kelly was impressed by her performance and JKP offered Haze an exclusive performing contract. This was soon followed by offers from other companies, but in April 2002 Haze decided to sign with JKP, as they offered the extra flexibility she needed to make money and build her career. Soon after signing with JKP, she formed a serious relationship with an industry cameraman and began a three-year period of performing exclusively with women. At the 2003 AVN Awards ceremony, Haze was named Best New Starlet and her masturbation scene in &quot;Big Bottom Sadie&quot; was awarded Best Solo Sex Scene. In 2004, she appeared on the HBO show Pornucopia, a six-part documentary on the pornography industry in California.
Haze became a free agent in April 2005, after deciding not to renew her contract with JKP, partly because Jill Kelly had recently left the company. After leaving JKP and splitting with her boyfriend, Haze returned to working with male performers. The April 2006 release &quot;Jenna Haze Darkside&quot; featured her first boy-girl scenes in over three years. The film was produced and directed by her new boyfriend Jules Jordan. Later in the year, she began writing a sex advice column for the pornographic magazine, &quot;Fox&quot;.

In 2006 she also started performing in striptease shows, represented by the agency Lee Network. The first achievement in her feature dancing career was a nomination for Best Feature Entertainer at the 2007 Night Moves Awards. Her film work was also rewarded in 2007, with AVN Awards for Best Oral Sex Scene (Video) and Best Group Sex Scene (Video), as well as a nomination for Female Performer of the Year.

In April 2007, &quot;Jenna Haze Oil Orgy&quot; became the first adult movie to be released on three high definition formats, Blu-ray, HD DVD and DVD-WMV. Meanwhile, in the same month, her official website was launched by Premium Multimedia.

In January 2008, her scene with Manuel Ferrara in &quot;Evil Anal 2&quot; won the AVN Award for Best Couples Sex Scene (Video). In August 2008, Haze achieved the first feature dancing award of her career winning Adult Movie Entertainer of the Year in the 11th annual Adult Nightclub and Exotic Dancer Awards. On January 10, 2009, Haze and Belladonna hosted the 2009 AVN Awards, and Haze won Female Performer of the Year.

In 2010, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked Haze sixteenth on their list of &quot;The 50 Prettiest Porn Stars of All Time&quot; and fifth on their list of &quot;The 10 Hottest Orange County Women.&quot; &quot;Complex&quot; also ranked her twentieth on their list of &quot;The Top 100 Hottest Porn Stars (Right Now)&quot; in 2011. She was also placed on CNBC&#x27;s yearly list of &quot;The Dirty Dozen: Porn&#x27;s Most Popular Stars&quot; in 2011 and 2012.

On February 7, 2012, Haze announced her retirement from performing via a homemade YouTube video, followed by a press release. She revealed that she had not shot a scene since April 2011, but she would possibly continue to direct and produce.

=== Jennaration X Studios ===
In 2009, Haze launched her own production company, Jennaration X Studios, headed by Haze and distributed through Jules Jordan Video. Haze is directing and performing in her production films.

Jennaration X&#x27;s debut film, &quot;Cum-Spoiled Sluts&quot;, (featuring scenes with Haze, Johnny Sins, Nikki Rhodes and James Deen) was released March 23, 2009, followed by &quot;Anal Academics&quot; which was released July 6, 2009.

=== Appearances ===
In the 2007 mainstream comedy film, &quot;Superbad&quot;, Haze made a short appearance in the role of Vagtastic Voyage Girl #2. Haze made a short appearance in the 2009 action/thriller film &quot;&quot; as a porn star on strike.

Published in 2007, Haze was among the adult stars featured in the erotic photography book &quot;Naked Ambition: An R-Rated Look at an X-Rated Industry&quot;. The special edition of the book included a fine art photograph of Haze signed by the photographer Michael Grecco.

Shortly after announcing her retirement in 2012, Haze appeared in the March edition of the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;FHM&quot; in a layout with former &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; star Taylor Momsen, and shortly thereafter had a cameo in Momsen&#x27;s band The Pretty Reckless&#x27; music video for the song &quot;My Medicine&quot;. She then appeared onstage with the band at their March 13 Los Angeles House Of Blues performance and gave Momsen an impromptu lap dance.

== Awards ==

== Personal life ==
According to her social media pages, Haze returned to school and majored in psychology.

In 2012 and 2013, Haze was romantically involved with heavy metal singer Greg Puciato of the band the Dillinger Escape Plan.

<text>Chutes Too Narrow is the second studio album by American rock band The Shins. Produced by Phil Ek and the band themselves, the album was released on October 21, 2003, through Sub Pop. The album title comes from a lyric in the song &quot;Young Pilgrims&quot;. The album was very well received by critics, garnering an overall score of 88/100 on Metacritic. As of August 2008 according to Nielsen SoundScan, they have sold over 393,000 copies to date.

&quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; features cleaner production standards than The Shins&#x27; &quot;lo-fi&quot; debut &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot;. This is largely due to the album&#x27;s being mixed by producer Phil Ek, who has also worked with Built to Spill and Modest Mouse. &quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; also departs from the band&#x27;s previous keyboard-driven sound and shifts towards more emphasis on guitars.

The album also included violin parts on &quot;Saint Simon&quot;, played by Annemarie Ruljancich, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. The cover art was designed by Jesse LeDoux. The songs &quot;Gone for Good&quot; and &quot;Those to Come&quot; were used in the 2004 film &quot;In Good Company&quot;. &quot;Those to Come&quot; was also used in the 2005 film &quot;Winter Passing&quot;.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; was recorded in the basement of James Mercer&#x27;s former home, located in a particularly rough neighborhood in Portland, Oregon. Although recording in the basement was less than pleasant, the band found it &quot;cheaper than a real studio&quot;, with Mercer noting that &quot;it only costs sixty bucks to buy deadbolts for the doors.&quot; Near the end of the recording process, the band was robbed of the computer they recorded on. &quot;So the master files are now in some crack addict&#x27;s basement,&quot; Mercer told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2003. Having cut ties with a bad relationship and a bad job, Mercer felt his songwriting reflected a broader perspective as a result. During the recording process, keyboardist Marty Crandall and his girlfriend, Elyse Sewell, saw a television advertisement for &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; and joked that she should try out. Host Tyra Banks called his girlfriend a week later, and Sewell went on to win third prize on America&#x27;s Next Top Model, wearing &quot;three different Shins T-shirts&quot; on the program.

Following the record&#x27;s completion, the album was mixed at Avast! Studios in Seattle and mastered at The Lodge in New York City.

==Music==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; is &quot;a study in old-school pop songwriting, full of Sixties-style psychedelic folk rock, abundant pop hooks and James Mercer&#x27;s inimitable high-pitched croon.&quot;

==Critical reception==

&quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; was met with critical acclaim upon its October 2003 release. Matt LeMay of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; designated it &quot;Best New Music&quot;, summarizing that &quot;Not simply an excellent album, &quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; is also a powerful testament to pop music&#x27;s capacity for depth, beauty and expressiveness.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Heather Phares wrote that the band &quot;excel[s] at sounding happy, sad, frustrated, and vulnerable at the same time, and their best songs, whether they&#x27;re fast or slow, feel like they&#x27;re bursting with nervous energy.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; Kelefa Sanneh called &quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; a &quot;sly, restless album that includes a cryptic protest song—full of sugary harmonies and disconcerting slogans—and a dreamy meditation on ontogeny.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the record four stars, with reviewer Barry Walters commenting, &quot;It must mean something that the freshest indie rock boasts tunes more substantial than what is sold in the mainstream.&quot;

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called Mercer &quot;a gifted melodist with an arranger&#x27;s knack for psychedelicizing simple structures and a folkie&#x27;s fondness for acoustic strum.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; called the record &quot;a leap forward&quot;, while &quot;Uncut&quot; wrote that &quot;You don&#x27;t expect progression from such evident classicists, but there&#x27;s a new clarity, poise and refinement.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; wrote that the album &quot;sears through the essence of what makes this band special, the brave voice and ebullient delivery of singer-songwriter-guitarist James Mercer.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; Zac Crain compared their style to their &quot;fellow travelers the New Pornographers&quot;, writing that &quot;the Shins are reverent and referential, practically documenting their source material with footnotes, while acting like they own it.&quot; While Dave Simpson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; opined that &quot;downbeat self-deprecation&quot; permeates the recording, he wrote that &quot;there&#x27;s a certain small-town romance vibe throughout, they&#x27;re not averse to surprises.&quot;

Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; felt the record was a disappointment in contrast to its &quot;near-perfect&quot; predecessor, but did speak positively when comparing: &quot;[&quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot;] does share its intelligence and concision, as well as its remarkable ability to make kicky pop-rock sound both simple and complex, retro and modern.&quot; In contrast, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; considered the album an improvement over &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot;: &quot;With better writing, better playing and better singing, the album illustrates the breadth of the lead singer and songwriter James Mercer&#x27;s vision; the cuts […] are elevated by accessible pop hooks and literate but unpretentious lyrics.&quot; Similarly, Robert Christgau felt it &quot;faster and clearer&quot; than the band&#x27;s &quot;paisley-fringed&quot; debut, writing that the album &quot;advances the Shins well beyond the dreamy indistinctness that has replaced lo-fi as Indieland&#x27;s distancing strategy of choice.&quot; &quot;Alternative Press&quot; wrote that the band &quot;satisfy largely by serving up more of what made their debut so good&quot;, and &quot;Blender&quot; felt similarly: &quot;Their second album is equally charming and more consistent.&quot; &quot;Magnet&quot; felt it &quot;a better record than the Shins&#x27; first—a sonically bolder production with fewer effects and more hooks per square inch than a flyrod factory.&quot; Will Hermes of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;[the band] follow 2001&#x27;s pop-a-licious &quot;Oh Inverted World&quot; with just the record you&#x27;d want: production a bit bigger […] and songs more adventurous but no less indelible.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; appeared on numerous music critics&#x27; and publications&#x27; end-of-year albums lists. Stylus Magazine placed the record at number three on their respective list, while &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop followed at number six. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed the record at number seven on their year-end list, writing that &quot;&quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; shattered expectations, a meticulously sequenced, stripped-down collection of indie pop gems encompassing endless Technicolor universes.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; also placed the album at number seven on their list, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on an unordered list of &quot;Best Albums of 2003&quot;.

<doc id="1236349" wikidata="Q7868104" url="?curid=1236349" title="USS Carondelet">
<text>USS &quot;Carondelet&quot; ( ) (1861) was a gunboat constructed for the War Department by James B. Eads during the American Civil War. It was named for the town where it was built, Carondelet, Missouri.

&quot;Carondelet&quot; was designed for service on the western rivers, with a combination of shallow draft and variety of heavy guns (and a light howitzer), she was suited for riverside bombardment and ship-to-ship combat against Confederate gunboats.

== Built in Carondelet Missouri in 1861 ==

USS &quot;Carondelet&quot;, an ironclad river gunboat, was built in 1861 by James Eads and Co., St. Louis, Missouri, at the Union Iron Works, in Carondelet, Missouri under contract to the United States Department of War. &quot;Carondelet&quot; was commissioned 15 January 1862, at Cairo, Illinois, U.S. Navy Commander Henry A. Walke in command, and reported to Army&#x27;s Western Gunboat Flotilla, commanded by U.S. Navy Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote.
== Civil War service ==

=== Union Army service ===

Between January and October 1862, &quot;Carondelet&quot; operated almost constantly on river patrol and in the capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February; the passing of Island No. 10 and the attack on and spiking of the shore batteries below New Madrid, Missouri, in April; the lengthy series of operations against Plum Point Bend, Fort Pillow, and Memphis, Tennessee, from April through June, and the engagement with on 15 July, during which &quot;Carondelet&quot; was heavily damaged and suffered 35 casualties.
=== Union Navy service ===

Transferred to Navy control with the other ships of her flotilla on 1 October 1862, &quot;Carondelet&quot; continued the rapid pace of her operations, taking part in the unsuccessful Steele&#x27;s Bayou Expedition in March 1863.

One of those to pass the Vicksburg and Warrenton, Mississippi batteries in April 1863, &quot;Carondelet&quot; took part on 29 April in the five-and-a-half-hour engagement with the batteries at Grand Gulf. She remained on duty off Vicksburg, bombarding the city in its long siege from May to July. Without her and her sisters and other naval forces, the great operations on the rivers would not have been possible and the Federal victory might not have been won.

From 7 March to 15 May 1864, she sailed with the Red River Expedition, and during operations in support of Union Army movements ashore, took part in the Bell&#x27;s Mill engagement (part of the Franklin-Nashville Campaign) of December 1864. For the remainder of the war, &quot;Carondelet&quot; patrolled in the Cumberland River.

=== Commanding Officers ===
&quot;Carondelet&quot; had several commanding officers over the duration of her service.

During the Civil War four of &quot;Carondelet&quot;″s crew members were awarded the Medal of Honor: Signal Quartermaster Matthew Arther for actions at the Battles of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, February 1862; Seaman John Dorman for actions in various engagements; Fireman Michael Huskey, for actions during Steele&#x27;s Bayou Expedition, March 1863; and Coxswain John G. Morrison, for actions in the engagement with CSS &quot;Arkansas&quot;, 15 July 1862.

== Post-war decommissioning and sale ==

She was decommissioned at Mound City, Illinois, on 20 June 1865, and sold there on 29 November 1865.

== Subsequent career and sinking ==

In 1873, shortly before she was to be scrapped, a flood swept &quot;Carondelet&quot; from her moorings in Gallipolis, Ohio. She then drifted approximately 130 miles down the Ohio River, where she grounded near Manchester, Ohio. Her ultimate fate remained unknown until a May 1982 search operation by Clive Cussler&#x27;s National Underwater and Marine Agency pinpointed the location of the wreckage, just two days after a dredge passed directly over the wreckage, demolishing most of the wrecked vessel.

== Armament ==
Like many of the Mississippi theatre ironclads, USS &quot;Carondelet&quot; had its armament changed multiple times over life of the vessel. To expedite the entrance of &quot;Carondelet&quot; into service, she and the other &quot;City&quot;-class gunboats were fitted with whatever weapons were available; then had their weapons upgraded as new pieces became available. Though the Dahlgren smoothbore cannons were fairly modern most of the other original armaments were antiquated; such as the 32-pounders, or modified; such as the 42-pounder &quot;rifles&quot; which were in fact, old smoothbores that had been gouged out to give them rifling. These 42-pounder weapons were of particular concern to military commanders because they were structurally weaker and more prone to exploding than purpose-built rifled cannons. Additionally, the close confines of riverine combat greatly increased the threat of boarding parties. The 12-pounder howitzer was equipped to address that concern and was not used in regular combat.

<text>Lewisham is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Lewisham is located 7 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Inner West Council.

==History==
Lewisham took its name in 1834 from the estate of Joshua Frey Josephson, a German-born businessman who would later become mayor of Sydney. The estate was named after the London borough of Lewisham, which means Leofsa&#x27;s village or manor.

The original residents of the Lewisham area were the Wangal clan of the Darug tribe. Artefacts found near the Cooks River indicate at least 7,000 years of habitation in the local area. When the First Fleet arrived in 1788, the settlers set up camp in the middle of Cadigal territory. While the first governor Arthur Phillip tried to establish cordial relations with the Cadigals and their neighbours, the two groups were competing for the same food sources and tensions inevitably developed. In 1789, a smallpox epidemic wiped out the majority of the Cadigals. By 1809, all the land within Lewisham had been granted.

In the 1880s, the Lewisham Estate Heritage Conservation Area developed from a series of subdivisions. It continued its expansion until 1898. The area features a mix of late 19th- and early 20th-century buildings in period-style residential architecture.

In 2014, the Inner West Light Rail was extended through the west of Lewisham.

== Heritage listings ==
Lewisham has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Great Southern and Western railway: Long Cove Creek railway viaducts, Lewisham
* The Boulevarde: Lewisham Sewer Vent
* over Long Cove Creek: Lewisham Sewage Aqueduct

==Transport==

Lewisham railway station is serviced by the Leppington &amp; Inner West Line and Liverpool &amp; Inner West Line of the Sydney Trains network. This provides access to Sydney CBD, the interchange station of Strathfield and the commercial centres of Burwood, Newtown and Parramatta.

Lewisham is notable in railway history as the termination point for the first train journey in the NSW colony in 1855, although the railway station was not built until 1885. The whipple truss bridge over Long Cove Creek was constructed 1885-1886 featuring North American technology developed by Squire Whipple. It is probably the most significant railway bridge site in Australia, certainly in NSW. It has the unique distinction of four different types of bridges from different eras. Engineers Australia designated the Viaduct in 1994 as an historic engineering marker.

There are two stations serving Lewisham on the Inner West Light Rail. These are Lewisham West, adjacent to the former flour mill on the border with Summer Hill, and Taverners Hill, near Parramatta Road. Access to the city is quicker by conventional train, but the light rail may be used for some cross-regional journeys. The light rail also provides an interchange with Dulwich Hill railway station to the south.

The 413 bus service, between Campsie and the city, cuts through the middle of Lewisham and provides an interchange with the railway station. Several bus services (461 - Burwood to the city, 480 &amp; 483 - Strathfield to the city) run along Parramatta Road. These interchange with the Taverners Hill stop. The other bus corridor is along New Canterbury Rd. This is served by the 428/L28 from Canterbury to the city via Newtown and route 445 from Campsie to Balmain.

==Schools==
A Trinity Grammar School Infants School was opened in February 2006 at 5 Thomas Street, Lewisham. The site was formerly Saint Thomas Becket Primary School which was founded in 1855 by the Sisters of Mercy. The school was originally for girls but became co-ed in the 1950s. Christian Brothers&#x27; High School is located on 58 - 61 The Boulevarde. Lewisham Public School is located on 71 The Boulevarde Lewisham. Petersham Public School is on the border of Lewisham and Petersham, the John Berne School (formerly the Berne Education Centre) and the Catholic Intensive English Centre are located on the site of the former St Thomas Boys High School, which closed in 1997.

==Churches==

Saint Thomas Becket&#x27;s Catholic church is located in Thomas Street. The current priest is Fr. Gerald Gleeson. The Servants of Mary Help of Christians operated its Marian Centre from St Thomas Becket Primary School Hall. It is now at 2 Missenden Rd, Camperdown, NSW 2049, operating from St. Joseph&#x27;s church.

Lewisham is also the home of the Maternal Heart of Mary Latin Mass Parish, a Personal Parish for the celebration of the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite, of which Fr Duncan Wong FSSP is the Parish Priest. The church is situated behind St Thomas Becket&#x27;s, on Charles O&#x27;Neill Way.

<doc id="1236355" wikidata="Q6797712" url="?curid=1236355" title="Mayor of Galway">
<text>The office of Mayor of Galway is an honorific title used by the of Galway City Council. The council has jurisdiction throughout its administrative area of the city of Galway which is the largest city in the province of Connacht, in Ireland. The current mayor is Peter Keane, (FF).

==Election to the office==
The Mayor is elected to office annually by Councillors of Galway City Council from amongst its members. There is no popular vote. Up to 1841, Mayors were elected in August and took office in September. There was a strong tradition of festivities to mark this start of a new municipal year. Current practice is for the term of office to begin in June with the former Mayor presenting the Chain of Office to the incoming Mayor, thus formally inaugurating a new term. The process is repeated the following June, unless the same person is given a second consecutive term.

==History of the office==

The office was originally established by a charter issued by King Richard III of England in December 1484 and had significant powers. The office has existed, with a break of ninety-seven years, since it was inaugurated in 1485. The Mayor led Galway Corporation from 1485 to 1841 and again from 1937 to 2001.

Prior to the creation of the mayoralty, the town of Galway was ruled by a Provost or Sovereign, who was appointed by the Earl of Ulster. After the murder of the 3rd Earl in June 1333, the town was under the control of successive members of the Clanricarde line of the House of Burke family. This situation lasted until well into the 15th century. However, charters from Richard II (in 1396) and Edward IV (in 1464) gave the citizens of the town semi-independence from the Clanricardes.

The office of Mayor of Galway was created by a charter issued by King Richard III of England in December 1484 at the solicitation of merchants from the city&#x27;s leading families, known as the Tribes of Galway. This made Galway a virtual city-state. Although it survived the turbulent 17th century, the massive corruption of the office led to its disestablishment in 1841, when Galway Corporation was relegated to the status of an urban district council, headed by a chairman. In 1937 the city regained its corporation status and the office of Mayor was re-installed.

The office was all but abolished under the Local Government Act 2001. All that remains of the office, per section 11 of the Act is a symbolic role: &quot;Subject to this Act, royal charters and letters patent relating to local authorities shall continue to apply for ceremonial and related purposes in accordance with local civic tradition but shall otherwise cease to have effect.&quot;. The Act goes on to state the chairman of the Council must be styled the Cathaoirleach and that &quot;Any reference in any other enactment to the lord mayor, mayor, chairman, deputy lord mayor, deputy mayor or vice-chairman or cognate words shall, where the context so requires, be read as a reference to the Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach or other title standing for the time being.&quot; (section 31 (3)).

<doc id="1236359" wikidata="Q602109" url="?curid=1236359" title="Down to Earth (Ozzy Osbourne album)">
<text>Down to Earth is the eighth studio album by English heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne. Released on 16 October 2001, it reached number 19 on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;The Ozzfest was doing well&quot;, Osbourne explained. &quot;I just wanted to be like the Grateful Dead and keep it going by touring, but the record company said they&#x27;d like a new Ozzy album.&quot;

&quot;Down to Earth&quot; spawned just two singles, although both reached the top ten of the US Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and the top 40 of the Canadian Singles Chart, and reached number 18 on the UK Singles Chart.

Excluding his contributions to re-recordings of Ozzy&#x27;s earlier material, &quot;Down to Earth&quot; is the only Osbourne studio album to feature bassist Robert Trujillo, who left to join Metallica in 2003. It was the first Osbourne album to feature drummer Mike Bordin, previously of Faith No More, though he had played live with Osbourne since 1996, as well as the last to feature guitarist Zakk Wylde until 2007&#x27;s &quot;Black Rain&quot;. Though he plays on the album, Wylde did not contribute as a songwriter for the first time since joining Osbourne&#x27;s band in 1988, because many of the songs were written before Wylde rejoined the band. Osbourne&#x27;s previous guitarist Joe Holmes was involved in the writing and Osbourne chose to use outside songwriters such as producer Tim Palmer and Aerosmith collaborator Marti Frederiksen.

&quot;Working with Tim on this album reminded me of [late guitarist] Randy [Rhoads]&quot;, Ozzy remarked of Palmer. &quot;If it hadn&#x27;t been for him, there wouldn&#x27;t have been an album ... He has incredible patience, just like Randy.&quot;

Allegedly, the Weezer song &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; was slated for this album. Ozzy approached Weezer vocalist Rivers Cuomo for song ideas, and &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; was one of them, however, Osbourne did not use the song, and Weezer included it on their &quot;Green Album&quot; instead.

<text>Dulwich Hill is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is 7.5 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Inner West Council. Dulwich Hill stretches south to the shore of the Cooks River.

==History==
The suburb takes its name from the area of Dulwich in London. The name Dulwich Hill appears in Sands Directory of 1892. It had been known by several different names prior to this. Following European settlement, it was called &quot;Petersham Hill&quot;. It later took the name &quot;Wardell&#x27;s Bush&quot;, a reference to Dr Robert Wardell, one of the area&#x27;s early landowners. Other names the area was given were &quot;South Petersham&quot; and &quot;Fern Hill&quot;.

The area became part of Sydney&#x27;s expanding tram network in 1889 and, like many suburbs in the inner-west, experienced rapid growth in the early twentieth century. As a consequence, the suburb has a large number of examples of Australian Federation architecture. It also features examples of Edwardian, Gothic and Italianate architecture. The tramway ran up until 1957.

Listed on the Register of the National Estate is the former public school in Seaview Street, which now operates as the Dulwich Hill High School of Visual Arts and Design. The building was designed by W.E.Kemp in the Romanesque style and built circa 1892. Situated in the same street is the former location of the Dulwich Hill Library, a converted cottage in the Victorian Gothic style.

==Commercial area==
Dulwich Hill features two shopping areas, a small number of shops on Wardell Road near Dulwich Hill railway station and the main shopping area around the northern end of Marrickville Road and its intersection with New Canterbury Road. The Marrickville Road shopping area centred on the former tram line (now replaced by buses), and continues onto New Canterbury Road. Cafés and restaurants have become popular as the suburb becomes gentrified. Marrickville Council upgraded the shopping strip in the early 2000s, enhancing the look and character of the area. Dulwich Hill has a library (a branch of Marrickville Library and the Inner West Library Service) and a post office, but was never chartered a town hall or police station (the nearest is Marrickville Local Area Command).

==Education==

Dulwich Hill contains three primary schools: Dulwich Hill Public School in Kintore Street, St Maroun&#x27;s College in Wardell Road and St Paul of the Cross, a Catholic school in New Canterbury Road, as well as one secondary school, Dulwich High School of Visual Arts &amp; Design in Seaview Street. Dulwich High School was the first Visual Arts School in Australia.

Notable graduates of the high school include former Parramatta rugby league coach Terry Fearnley, tennis player Phil Dent and opera singer Yvonne Minton, while former rugby league referee Jack Danzey taught there.

==Transport==

===Tram history===
Until the late 1950s, when the local tramway system was closed, electric trams ran to Dulwich Hill and the Cooks River from Circular Quay. The line to Dulwich Hill branched from the Cooks River line at Newtown, turning off King Street into Enmore Road, travelling through Marrickville and Dulwich Hill, via Victoria and Marrickville Roads. A tram tuning loop was provided at the Canterbury Road terminus.

===Modern transport===

Modern public transport to the area comprises one railway station, four light rail stops and several bus routes.

Dulwich Hill railway station is located on Wardell Road, in the southern part of the suburb. Since 30 September 2024, it has been serviced by light rail and bus services only, pending conversion of the Bankstown railway line to Sydney Metro standards. Once these works are complete, Dulwich Hill will gain Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line services to the Sydney CBD, replacing the previous Sydney Trains service.

The Inner West Light Rail starts at Dulwich Hill railway station and includes three other stations in the suburb: Dulwich Grove (between New Canterbury Road and Hercules Street), Arlington (adjacent to Johnson Park near Constitution Road) and Waratah Mills (near Davis Street). Light rail services continue to the Sydney CBD, though via a more indirect route than the Bankstown railway line.

The 426, 428 and 412 routes provide bus connections between Dulwich Hill and the Sydney CBD. The 426 is the suburb&#x27;s main bus route, starting at the corner of Marrickville and New Canterbury Roads and running along Marrickville Road towards Marrickville. The 428 service runs from Canterbury station along New Canterbury Road towards Petersham. Both routes merge at Enmore and proceed to the city via King Street, Newtown. The 412 runs from Campsie to the city. It comes up Wardell Road, passing Dulwich Hill railway station, before running along the south side of the railway and proceeding up Livingstone Road towards Marrickville and Petersham. In the CBD, all routes proceed up Elizabeth Street and terminate at Martin Place.

Other routes serving the suburb are the 445, 418 and 425. The 445 routes run from Campsie station to Balmain via Leichhardt, following the same route as the 428 through Dulwich Hill. The 418 between Bondi Junction and Burwood via Ashfield follows the same route as 426 between Marrickville and Dulwich Hill shops, before swinging on to New Canterbury Road, and then south to Hurlstone Park Station. The 425 follows the same route as the 426 to Marrickville, before heading to Tempe. It only operates during daytime hours on weekdays and Saturdays. All routes are operated by Transit Systems.

==Residential==
A number of residential subdivisions in Dulwich Hill occurred in the early 20th century, and include well preserved Federation and Interwar era houses. These include, for example the Abelgeldie Estate in the northwest as well as the area around Hoskins Park, which are protected as heritage conservation areas. The former freight line, now light rail line, runs north-south through Dulwich Hill, and is the centre of an area formerly of industrial use, now mostly converted to medium density residential flats.

==Churches==
The area is served by several religious organisations, including Anglican, Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Salvation Army churches.

<text>Summer Hill railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Main Suburban line, serving the Sydney suburb of Summer Hill. It is served by Sydney Trains T2 Leppington &amp; Inner West Line and occasional T3 Liverpool &amp; Inner West Line services.

==History==
Summer Hill station opened on 15 September 1879. The Main Suburban line through Summer Hill was quadruplicated in 1892, and sextuplicated in 1927 in association with electrification works.

As part of the 1892 work, the northern side platform was converted to an island platform and a new platform constructed on the most northern line. The latter was demolished as part of the 1927 works.

In 2004, Summer Hill was provided with lift facilities which are accessed from the subway. Initial plans called for a new overhead footbridge to access the station; however, this was opposed by locals on both aesthetic and access grounds, and the plans were subsequently altered to the current arrangement.

==Platforms and services==
==Transport links==
Summer Hill station is served by one NightRide route:
*N50: Liverpool to Town Hall station

<doc id="1236377" wikidata="Q661592" url="?curid=1236377" title="Luc Robitaille">
<text>Luc Jean-Marie Robitaille (born February 17, 1966) is a Canadian-American professional ice hockey executive and former player who serves as president of the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL).

During his 19-season NHL career, Robitaille won the Stanley Cup in 2001–02 with the Detroit Red Wings, and played for the Pittsburgh Penguins and New York Rangers, but is most known for his 14 seasons (over three different stints) with the Los Angeles Kings. He served as the Kings&#x27; team captain during the 1992–93 season (while Wayne Gretzky was injured) and for the final two games of the 2005–06 season. Robitaille retired after the 2005–06 season as the highest-scoring left winger in NHL history and the holder of several Kings franchise records, along with numerous Kings playoff records. In 2017, Robitaille was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history.

==Junior hockey career==
Robitaille was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings in the ninth round, 171st overall, of the 1984 NHL Entry Draft. Many hockey experts expected Robitaille to be drafted late in the draft due to his poor skating ability. Robitaille himself has stated he had only had contact with one NHL team during his junior career, the Kings. He happened to be attending the 1984 draft (in the stands) and later introduced himself to first-year Kings general manager Rogie Vachon.

Robitaille and former teammate Dave Taylor are the lowest NHL draft picks to have recorded 1,000 career points. During the 1984 NHL Entry Draft, the Kings drafted future Baseball Hall-of-Famer Tom Glavine in the fourth round, over 100 spots before Robitaille.

Robitaille played junior hockey for the Hull Olympiques of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). In three seasons with the Olympiques from 1983 to 1986, Robitaille amassed 155 goals and 269 assists for 424 points in only 197 games, including winning the CHL Player of the Year with 191 points in 1985–86. In his honour, the QMJHL later created the Luc Robitaille Trophy, awarded to the team which scores the most goals each season.

==National Hockey League career==

===Los Angeles Kings (1986–1994)===
Robitaille&#x27;s first NHL season was in 1986–87, where he helped the Kings qualify for the 1987 Stanley Cup playoffs despite a 31–41–8 record. He scored 45 goals and had 39 assists in 79 games, edging out Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Ron Hextall for the Calder Memorial Trophy for the NHL&#x27;s top rookie, the only Los Angeles player to ever win the award. He also earned a spot on the second All-Star team.

Robitaille scored more than 40 goals in each of his first eight seasons, including three 50 or more goal seasons, with a career-high 63 in 1992–93. That year, Robitaille set NHL records for most goals and points (125) in a season by a left winger. Robitaille&#x27;s 63-goal record amongst left wingers was eclipsed by Alexander Ovechkin during the 2007–08 season, although Robitaille still holds the record for most points in a season by a left winger. With captain and superstar Wayne Gretzky sidelined by injury for much of 1992–93, Robitaille assumed the captaincy and led the team in scoring, playing a key role in helping his struggling team to make the playoffs. In 1993, the Kings reached the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history. However, they lost to the Montreal Canadiens in five games. Robitaille had 9 goals and 13 assists in 24 playoff games.

During the 1993–94 season, Robitaille&#x27;s scoring totals remained respectable but considerably lower than his previous seasons, while Gretzky had returned from injury to win the NHL scoring title. The Kings failed to make the 1994 playoffs.

===Pittsburgh Penguins, New York Rangers (1994–1997)===
On July 29, 1994, Robitaille was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Rick Tocchet and the Penguins&#x27; second-round pick in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft (used to select Pavel Rosa). With Pittsburgh, Robitaille set then-career lows in goals and assists during the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season.

After one season, Robitaille was traded to the New York Rangers (alongside Ulf Samuelsson) in exchange for Petr Nedvěd and Sergei Zubov. Robitaille had below-average numbers in two seasons with the Rangers, and for the first time in his career, had more penalty minutes (80) than points (69) in 1995–96.

===Return to Los Angeles (1997–2001)===
On August 28, 1997, in new general manager Dave Taylor&#x27;s first move, the Kings re-acquired Robitaille from the Rangers in exchange for Kevin Stevens.

Robitaille struggled in his first season back in Los Angeles, scoring only 16 goals in an injury-shortened 1997–98 season. However, in the 1998-99 season, Robitaille returned to his All-Star form, scoring no fewer than 36 goals and had the best stats of his career after his first stint with the Kings during those three seasons. On January 7, 1999, he scored his 500th career goal in a 4–2 victory at the Great Western Forum against the Buffalo Sabres.

During the 2000–01 season, Robitaille scored 37 goals and 88 points. In the 2000–01 playoffs, Robitaille helped the seventh-seeded Kings to a first-round upset of the Detroit Red Wings, and his team took the eventual Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche to seven games in the conference semifinals. Robitaille was named a second team all-star, his first post-season team honour since 1993. Robitaille turned down a one-year deal with a substantial pay cut by Kings GM Dave Taylor.

===Detroit Red Wings (2001–2003)===
Robitaille signed a two-year, $9 million contract with the Red Wings beginning in the 2001–02 season, accepting less compensation than what other teams offered because the Red Wings represented his best chance at winning the Stanley Cup, particularly after their recent acquisition of goaltender Dominik Hašek.

In his first season with the Red Wings, Robitaille scored 30 goals and 50 points, helping them win the Presidents&#x27; Trophy, awarded to the team with the best regular season record. Due to the tremendous depth of scorers among Detroit&#x27;s roster, Robitaille had less playoff ice time, although he still scored four playoff goals. The Red Wings defeated the Avalanche in the Western Conference Finals in seven games, meaning that Robitaille was going to the Stanley Cup Finals for the second time in his career. With the Red Wings&#x27; 3–1 victory in Game 5 against the Carolina Hurricanes, Robitaille&#x27;s quest for an elusive Stanley Cup championship finally came to an end. At the direction of Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman, all of the teammates who had never previously won the Cup would hoist it after Yzerman, with Robitaille being the third Red Wing to skate the Cup around Joe Louis Arena, after Yzerman and Hašek.

Robitaille then had the lowest goal total in his career in 2002–03, due partially to limited ice time, and the Red Wings were upset in the first round of the playoffs by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in a four-game sweep.

===Final stint with Los Angeles (2003–2006)===
Robitaille returned to Kings as a free agent for the 2003–04 season. Although his scoring totals (22 goals and 29 assists) were below his previous levels as a King, he did lead the team in both goals and points, and the Kings stayed in playoff contention until a shocking 11-game losing streak to finish the season. On March 9, 2004, Robitaille scored the 650th goal of his professional career in a 3–2 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes at Staples Center. He played his 1,000th game as a King a few days later, on March 13, 2004, in a 3–1 loss to the San Jose Sharks at HP Pavilion at San Jose.

On January 19, 2006, during a game against the Atlanta Thrashers, Robitaille scored a hat-trick, tying and passing Marcel Dionne&#x27;s then-franchise record of 550 goals. His record-breaking goal was met with several minutes of standing ovations and a video-congratulation reel on the scoreboard. On April 10, the Kings announced Robitaille&#x27;s intention to retire at the conclusion of the 2005–06 NHL season. Robitaille officially confirmed this the next day in a press conference held at the Toyota Sports Center in El Segundo, California. Robitaille&#x27;s final goal and point was scored in typical Luc Robitaille fashion: one-timing a pass from Jeremy Roenick while at the centre of the right wing face-off circle past goaltender Curtis Joseph during a power play in a March 14, 2006, 6–2 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes.

Robitaille played his final NHL home game as a Los Angeles King against the Calgary Flames on April 15, 2006. He also wore the captain&#x27;s &quot;C&quot; that normally belonged to defenceman Mattias Norström. Although he was held without a point in the game, he logged 18:37 of ice time and had four shots on goal. He was also the second shooter in the shootout, but his shot towards the upper-right corner of the net was stopped by the glove of goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff, despite being given an open five hole. The Kings ultimately won the game 2–1 off of a shootout goal by Pavol Demitra and three shootout saves by Kings goaltender Jason LaBarbera. The Kings held a curtain call for Robitaille after the game, where he was given a standing ovation by the sell-out crowd of 18,118 fans in attendance. After chants of his name died down, he gave a short speech and did one final lap of the rink at Staples Center.

Robitaille finished his playing career on April 17, 2006, at the HP Pavilion in a game against the San Jose Sharks. The Kings won 4–0. He received applause and chants of &quot;Luuuc, Luuuc!&quot; throughout the night by the 17,496 fans in attendance, as well as good wishes from many of the opposing players of the Sharks. After the game ended, the Kings players came out and gathered around him first, rather than the traditional congratulation of the goaltender. The Sharks players also came onto the ice to shake hands with Robitaille before they headed off into their locker room. 

==Legacy==
At the end of his career, Robitaille had made eight NHL All-Star teams, set the NHL record for goals by a left winger (with 668) and points (with 1,394), as well the Kings&#x27; franchise record for goals, with 577, finished second to Dave Taylor in games played, fourth (behind Marcel Dionne, Wayne Gretzky and Taylor) in assists with 726, second behind John Bucyk&#x27;s NHL record for assists by a left winger (813), and second to Dionne in points, with 1,154. Robitaille also became the second player in NHL history to record 1,000 points after being drafted as low as the ninth round.

The Kings honored his playing career by retiring his number during a pre-game ceremony on January 20, 2007. Robitaille&#x27;s number 20 hangs in the rafters of Crypto.com arena alongside those of Rogatien Vachon, Marcel Dionne, Dave Taylor, Wayne Gretzky, Rob Blake, and Dustin Brown.

On June 23, 2009, it was announced Robitaille would be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He was honored during the November 6–9 induction weekend alongside his former Detroit Red Wing teammates Steve Yzerman and Brett Hull and former Ranger teammate Brian Leetch.

Robitaille has won three Stanley Cup championships, in 2002 as the member of the Detroit Red Wings, and in 2012 and 2014 as president of operations with the Los Angeles Kings.

On March 7, 2015, the Kings organization unveiled a bronze statue of Robitaille outside of the Staples Center honouring his accomplishments as an NHL player and as a member of the Kings. The statue is located near the main entrance to the arena, next to the statue honoring former King and teammate Wayne Gretzky.

==United States Hockey League==
On July 6, 2006, Robitaille was named president of the Omaha Lancers of the United States Hockey League (USHL).

==International play==
Robitaille has participated in three international tournaments for Canada:
*1986 World Junior Championships
*1991 Canada Cup
*1994 World Championships
The gold medal at the 1994 world championship was Canada&#x27;s first title in 33 years. Going unbeaten through the tournament, Canada faced Finland in the final. Finland took the lead, but Canada courtesy of Rod Brind&#x27;Amour tied the game. Ten minutes of overtime solved nothing, and the game went into a shoot out. In the first five shots, Robitaille and Joe Sakic scored for Canada, but Jari Kurri and Mikko Mäkelä responded for the Finns, meaning the game moved to a sudden-victory shootout. Robitaille was up first for Canada and, despite losing the puck on his approach, was able to beat Jarmo Myllys to put the pressure on the Finns. Bill Ranford made the save, and Canada was once again world champion. &quot;I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever jumped so high in my life,&quot; Robitaille said later of his reaction after Ranford&#x27;s final save. &quot;It was just such a relief, and the celebration was something I will never forget.&quot;

==Executive career==
Robitaille was named the Kings&#x27; president of business operations on May 25, 2007. He also serves as the team&#x27;s alternate governor. On April 10, 2017, Robitaille was named president of the Kings.

Since joining the Kings in a management role, the team has won two Stanley Cups, in 2011–12 and 2013–14.

Robitaille and his wife Stacia co-founded the non-profit charity Shelter for Serenity in 2005 to help families displaced by Hurricane Katrina, and has extended to needy children in the Los Angeles community as Echoes of Hope.

Robitaille made an appearance on the FOX TV series &quot;Bones&quot; in the season 4 episode &quot;Fire in the Ice&quot;. He appears as himself in an hallucination had by lead character Seeley Booth (portrayed by David Boreanaz, a passionate hockey fan), when Booth is knocked out while playing in a recreational hockey game.

Robitaille also appeared in the movie &quot;Sudden Death&quot;. The directors used this to their advantage, sending Robitaille in on a breakaway to tie the game as time expired.

In Canada, Robitaille appeared alongside New Jersey Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur in a Delissio frozen pizza commercial, where the two watch footage of Robitaille&#x27;s many goals against Brodeur while sharing a pizza.

Robitaille made a cameo appearance as himself in the 1994 movie, &quot;D2: The Mighty Ducks&quot;, and voiced himself in the &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; episode &quot;For Your Ice Only&quot;.

He also made a cameo appearance as himself in the 15th episode of the eighth season of the CBS sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;. He is featured, among other Canadian celebrities, in &quot;Underneath the Tunes&quot;, a parody of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Robitaille is married to Stacia (née Toten, formerly McQueen). They have two sons, Steven (born July 13, 1988, from his wife&#x27;s first marriage) and Jesse (born June 2, 1995). Robitaille&#x27;s stepson, Steven, is grandson of actor Steve McQueen and is an actor in the TV series &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;.

<doc id="1236378" wikidata="Q286608" url="?curid=1236378" title="United States Flag Code">
<text>The United States Flag Code establishes advisory rules for display and care of the national flag of the United States of America. It is part of Chapter 1 of Title 4 of the United States Code ( &quot;et seq&quot;). Although this is a U.S. federal law, the code is not mandatory: it uses non-binding language like &quot;should&quot; and &quot;custom&quot; throughout and does not prescribe any penalties for failure to follow the guidelines. It was &quot;not intended to prescribe conduct&quot; and was written to &quot;codify various existing rules and customs.&quot;

Separately, Congress passed the Flag Protection Act of 1968 (amended in 1989) (), a since struck-down criminal statute, which prohibited mutilating, defacing, defiling or burning the flag. Although it remains part of codified federal law, it is not enforceable due to the Supreme Court of the United States finding it unconstitutional in &quot;United States v. Eichman&quot;.

Additionally, the public law which includes the Flag Code (Pub. L. 105–225, largely codified in Title 36 of the U.S. Code), addresses conduct when the U.S. National Anthem is being played while the flag is present. That law suggests civilians in attendance should face the flag &quot;at attention&quot; (standing upright) with their hand over their heart.

== Definition of a United States flag ==
The U.S. flag is defined by , executive order and official government standards: The flag of the United States for the purpose of this chapter shall be defined according to sections 1 and 2 of this title and Executive Order 10834 issued pursuant thereto.Executive Order 10834 &quot;Proportions And Sizes Of Flags And Position Of Stars&quot; prescribes the design of the flag as well as Federal Specification DDD-F-416F.

==Summary of the advisory code==
* The flag should never be dipped to any person or thing, unless it is the ensign responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. This is sometimes misreported as a tradition that comes from the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, where countries were asked to dip their flag to King Edward VII; American team flag bearer Ralph Rose did not follow this protocol, and teammate Martin Sheridan is often, though apocryphally, quoted as proclaiming that &quot;this flag dips before no earthly king.&quot;
* When a flag is so tattered that it no longer fits to serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be replaced in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The American Legion, Boy Scouts of America, Girl Scouts of the USA, TrailLife USA, U.S. Armed Forces, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and other organizations regularly conduct dignified flag retirement ceremonies.
* The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.
* The flag should never touch anything physically beneath it. An urban myth claimed that if the flag touched the ground, it had to be destroyed under the Flag Code; however, it has been affirmed by the American Legion and state governments that this is not the case.
* The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds but always allowed to fall free.
* The flag should always be permitted to fall freely. (An exception was made during the Apollo Moon landings when the flag hung from a vertical pole designed with an extensible horizontal bar, allowing full display even in the absence of an atmosphere.)
* The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally.
* The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever.
* The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.
* The flag should never be upside down, except to signal distress or great danger.
* When displayed vertically against a wall, the union should be to the observer’s left.

==History==

===Flag Day===
Prior to Flag Day, June 14, 1923, neither the federal government nor the states had official guidelines governing the display of the United States&#x27; flag. On that date, the National Flag Code was constructed by representatives of over 68 organizations, under the auspices of the National Americanism Commission of the American Legion. The code drafted by that conference was printed by the national organization of the American Legion and given nationwide distribution.

On June 22, 1942, the code became Public Law 77-623; chapter 435. Little had changed in the code since the Flag Day 1923 Conference. The most notable change was the removal of the Bellamy salute because of its similarities to the Hitler salute.

The Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005 prohibits real estate management organizations from restricting homeowners from displaying the Flag of the United States on their own property.

The Army Specialist Greg L. Chambers Federal Flag Code Amendment Act of 2007 added a provision to allow governors, or the mayor of the District of Columbia, to proclaim that the flag be flown at half-staff upon the death of a member of the Armed Forces from any State, territory, or possession who died while serving on active duty. The provision directs federal facilities in the area covered by the governor or mayor of the District of Columbia to fly the flag at half-staff consistent with such proclamations.

The allows the military salute for the flag during the national anthem by members of the Armed Forces not in uniform and by veterans.

<doc id="1236379" wikidata="Q254094" url="?curid=1236379" title="Hallel">
<text>Hallel (, &#x27;Praise&#x27;) is a Jewish prayer, a verbatim recitation from Psalms which is recited by observant Jews on Jewish holidays as an act of praise and thanksgiving.

==Types==
===Full Hallel===
Full Hallel () consists of all six Psalms of the Hallel, in their entirety. It is a Jewish prayer recited on the first two nights and days of Pesach (only the first night and day in Israel), on Shavuot, all seven days of Sukkot, on Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah, and on the eight days of Hanukkah. The sages have provided a &quot;siman&quot; (a way to remember) the days when full Hallel is recited. It is called &quot;BeBeTaCh&quot;.

A blessing is recited at the beginning and end of Full Hallel.

===Partial Hallel===
Partial Hallel () omits parts of the Full Hallel: The first 11 verses of both Psalms 115 and 116 are omitted. In Yemenite Jewish custom, additional passages are omitted: Psalm 117, and Psalm 118:1–4.

Partial Hallel is recited on the last six days of Pesach and on Rosh Chodesh. On these days Hallel was originally not recited at all, and the partial recitation indicates that it is only done by later custom rather than to fulfill a requirement. Regarding Passover, the Talmud argues that Full Hallel is only recited on days when the Temple sacrifice differed from the previous day&#x27;s, while the sacrifice for all days of Passover was identical. Other sources suggest a different reason: that Full Hallel is omitted on the seventh day of Passover in consideration of the Egyptians who died during the Crossing the Red Sea, and omitted on the middle days of Passover so that they not overshadow the seventh day. Regarding Rosh Chodesh, the Talmud states that Hallel is only required on days on which work is forbidden, which is not the case on Rosh Chodesh.

While Ashkenazi Jews recite a blessing at the beginning and end of Partial Hallel, some Sephardic Jews do not, and the few Sephardic communities that do recite a blessing on half Hallel (Moroccans and Spanish &amp; Portuguese Jews, as well as some others) recite (to read the Hallel, as is always recited by contemporary Ashkenazim) on Half Hallel, as opposed to the blessing (to complete the Hallel) that they recite on Full Hallel.

==Occasions==
Hallel consists of six Psalms (113–118), which are recited as a unit, on joyous occasions including the each day of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot), as well as at Hanukkah and Rosh Chodesh.

On all these occasions, Hallel is recited as part of the morning Shacharit prayer service, following the Amidah. In addition, it is recited in many communities during the evening prayers on the first (and, outside Israel, second) night of Pesach; however, according to the original Nusach Ashkenaz it is not recited at this time, and thus it is not recited in communities such as Litvaks (although most Litvish communities in Israel do recite it) and Yekkes. It is recited in all communities during the Passover Seder service. According to the Talmud, there was a dispute between the Houses of Hillel and Shammai regarding the reading of Hallel during the Seder. According to the school of Shammai, only the first psalm (Ps. 113) should be read before the meal, whereas the school of Hillel advocated reading the first two psalms (Ps. 113 and 114). The remaining Psalms would be said after the Grace After Meals (as is usually the case, the halacha follows the school of Hillel).

On Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, Hallel is not said at all, because as the Talmud states: &quot;Is it seemly for the king to be sitting on His Throne of Judgment, with the Books of Life and Death open before Him, and for the people to sing joyful praises to Him?&quot;

No Hallel is recited on Purim, despite the fact that there was a miraculous salvation. The Talmud suggests three reasons for this:
* The miracle did not occur in the Land of Israel and, for &quot;lesser&quot; holidays, only those occurring in Israel merit the recitation of Hallel.
* The redemption was not complete: after the Miracle of Purim, Jews remained subjects of the Achaemenid Empire (whereas on Hanukkah, Jews gained their independence from the Seleucid Empire).
* Reading the Book of Esther is considered a form of Hallel.

Partial Hallel is recited on the last six days of Passover, and on Rosh Chodesh. On all other occasions when Hallel is recited, the text is the full Hallel.

Many Jewish communities, especially those which identify with religious Zionism, recite Hallel on Israeli Independence Day and some also recite it on Jerusalem Day. The Chief Rabbinate of Israel instructs Jews to recite Hallel during Israeli Independence Day.

==Other Hallel sequences==
The name &quot;Hallel&quot; is normally applied to Psalms 113–118. For greater specificity this is sometimes called the Egyptian Hallel (). This name is due to its mention of the Exodus from Egypt in .

===Great Hallel===
The term Great Hallel () is used to refer to Psalm 136; according to other opinions in the Talmud, Great Hallel refers to either Psalms 135–136 or 134–136. Each verse of Psalm 136 concludes with the refrain &quot;for his mercy endures forever&quot; and it contains mention of twenty-six acts of Divine kindness and sustenance for the world. It is recited at the Passover Seder after the standard Hallel is completed. It is also said in the expanded pesukei dezimra on the morning of Shabbat and festivals. In the Talmudic era, if rain fell on the morning of a fast day that was declared in response to a drought, this was seen as a sign of Divine favor, in which case &quot;the Great Hallel&quot; was added in the afternoon prayers. There is mention in some references that this Psalm may also be used antiphonally in Temple worship.

Psalm 136 was most probably used antiphonally in Temple worship. In Jewish liturgy, the Great Hallel is recited at the Passover Seder after the Lesser Hallel. All through the refrain is a repeated reference to the Lord&#x27;s steadfast love (see ). This psalm is a hymn that opens with a call to praise God because of God&#x27;s great deeds in nature and God&#x27;s gracious historical actions in the history of Israel. It continues expressing God&#x27;s mercy toward all and ends with another call to praise God.

===Pesukei Dezimra===
Pesukei dezimra is also described by the Talmud as a kind of Hallel.

==Musical settings==
In the Jewish tradition, there are well established and various melodies for the singing of Hallel. Some of the psalms are sung while others are recited silently or under the breath.

In the classical tradition, psalms from the Hallel have been set to music many times, notably:
* Psalm 114
** Mendelssohn
** Josquin des Prez
* Psalm 115
** Johann Sebastian Bach in Cantata BWV 196, &quot;Der Herr denket an uns&quot;, using verses 12–15
* Psalm 117
** Antonio Vivaldi
** Mozart
* Psalm 118
** Léonin
** Pérotin

American composer and conductor Michael Isaacson has composed a full Hallel for SATB chorus, entitled &quot;An American Hallel&quot;, with interpolations of expressions of praise and gratitude by past and present Americans. It was premiered by the Carolina Master Chorale under the directorship of Tim Koch in the autumn of 2009.

Composer/performer Sam Glaser has also set the Psalms on his CD &quot;Hallel&quot;.

==New Testament==
The New Testament accounts of the Last Supper state that Jesus and his disciples &quot;sang a psalm&quot; or &quot;hymn&quot; after the meal before leaving for the Mount of Olives (, ), which may have been the Hallel. The Last Supper is popularly considered to have been a celebration of the Passover, although this is controversial among scholars. Jesus, like any other literate Jew in the first century, may well have known how to chant the Psalms in Hebrew, especially the famous Hallel psalms which were an integral part of the Passover.

<text>Noodles are a staple of Japanese cuisine. They are often served chilled with dipping sauces, or in soups or hot dishes. Noodles were introduced to Japan from China during the Song Dynasty between the Heian until the early Kamakura period.

==History==
Noodles were first discovered in Japan around 800 A.D. during the Heian period (794–1185). This dish was adopted from China and was highly idolized in daily dieting due to the dishes flexibility and multiple different forms of serving options. Later on during the Kamakura period (1185–1333), noodles began to be viewed as a standard dish for most Samurai. This was because the dish met the dietary needs as it was not greasy and was a relatively healthy food.

During the Edo period, specifically between the 1661 to 1672, Soba noodles became popular in restaurants in the capital city of Edo (now Tokyo). It is rumored that it became extremely popular because soba noodles can be served cold, and with all of the fires occurring, the government limited the use of fuel.

==Types of Japanese noodles==
* Ramen are thin, wheat-based noodles made from wheat flour, salt, water, and &quot;kansui&quot;, a form of alkaline water. The dough is risen before being rolled. They were imported from China during the Meiji period. How it made the jump from China to Japan is still under debate, but it&#x27;s generally accepted that in 1910 a Chinese restaurant in Yokohama started serving a dish known as lamian. &quot;Ramen&quot; noodles have a firm texture and are usually pale yellow in color. The noodles may vary in shape, width, and length. They are served in a broth. Examples of &quot;ramen&quot; dishes are &quot;shōyu ramen&quot;, &quot;shio ramen&quot;, &quot;miso ramen&quot;, &quot;tonkotsu ramen&quot;, and &quot;curry ramen&quot;.

* Shirataki are clear noodles made from &quot;konnyaku&quot;. These noodles are chewy or rubbery. &quot;Shirataki&quot; are used to add texture to dishes such as &quot;sukiyaki&quot; and &quot;oden&quot;.

* Soba is a noodle made from buckwheat and wheat flour. &quot;Soba&quot; noodles are available dried or fresh. They may be served with hot broth or cold with dipping sauce (&quot;tsuyu&quot;). Examples of &quot;soba&quot; dishes are &quot;zaru soba&quot; (chilled), &quot;kake soba&quot;, &quot;tempura soba&quot;, &quot;kitsune soba&quot;, and &quot;tororo soba&quot;. Although the popular Japanese dish &quot;Yakisoba&quot; includes &quot;soba&quot; in its name, the dish is made with Chinese-style noodles (&quot;chūkamen&quot;).

* Sōmen noodles are a very thin, white, wheat-based noodle. They are usually served chilled in the summertime with dipping sauces although they may be used in soups and other hot dishes. &quot;Sōmen&quot; noodles are very similar to &quot;hiyamugi&quot; and &quot;udon&quot; noodles, only they are thinner (about 1.3mm in width). &quot;Sōmen&quot; requires oil in its manufacture. During the summer months Japanese consume chilled &quot;sōmen&quot; to stay cool.

* Hiyamugi are wheat flour noodles similar to &quot;sōmen&quot; and &quot;udon&quot; noodles and somewhere in between the two in size. These noodles are often served in the same manner as &quot;sōmen&quot; and &quot;udon&quot; noodles. While they are mostly white, there are bundles mixed with noodles of pinkish or brown hues.

* Udon are the thickest of the noodles served in Japanese cuisine. &quot;Udon&quot; are white, wheat-based noodles, that are 4-6mm in width. These noodles are served chilled with a dipping sauce in the summer months, or in hot dishes and soups when the temperature is cooler. &quot;Udon&quot; dishes include &quot;kitsune udon&quot;, &quot;Nabeyaki udon&quot;, &quot;curry udon&quot;, and &quot;yaki udon&quot;. However, &quot;sara udon&quot; is made using a different kind of noodle which is crispy. There are three nationally recognized regions in Japan known for their &quot;Udon noodles&quot;: Kagawa (Sanuki udon), Gunma (Mizusawa udon), and Akita (Inaniwa udon). These three regions contributed unique recipes of &quot;Udon&quot;, as well as different historical and cultural backgrounds of udon production and consumption. In the Kagawa region, it is considered the &quot;kingdom of Sanuki udon&quot; noodle, and has been deemed a symbol of regional identity to revitalize the regional food industry and to promote regional tourism. In the Gunma region, due to the high amount of noodle shops serving udon in the surrounding cities (Mizusawa, Kiryu, and Tatebayashi), Gunma was deemed the best place where visitors can experience the best locally produced udon noodle in Japan.

* Harusame are glass noodles made from potato starch. These type of noodles are commonly used in hotpot dishes and salads, and used to create Japanese adaptations of Korean and Chinese noodle dishes. &quot;Harusame&quot; dishes include &quot;harusame salad&quot;, which is a cold noodle salad that features three main ingredients of julienned cucumbers, ham, and carrots. Other ingredients can include wakame seaweed, shredded egg omelet, tomatoes, bean sprouts, and more.

* Tokoroten are jelly-like slices made of Kanten which comes from the gelatin of the tengusa a native seaweed. This dish was usually a summer time dish as it was composed of about 98% water. Tokoroten dates back to 1658 when an innkeeper discarded some Tokoroten which dried out into strips of Kanten which could be stored and preserved. The dish is typically garnished with soy sauce as well as rice vinegar.

<text>Petersham is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Petersham is located 6 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Inner West Council. Petersham is known for its extensive Portuguese commercial offerings, with many Portuguese businesses and restaurants, although only 156 (1.9%) of the population was actually born in Portugal.

Petersham is bordered by the suburbs of Leichhardt to the north, Stanmore to the east, Marrickville to the south and Lewisham to the west. Taverner&#x27;s Hill, named after Fred Taverner, is a locality in the western part of the suburb.

==History==

Major Francis Grose sent workmen to the area in 1793 to clear the bush and plant corn and wheat. He named the area Peters-Ham or Petersham after his native village in Surrey, England. Petersham remained an agricultural area, winning awards for some of the best crops and stock in the colony in 1803. Kangaroo hunting was also popular in the area. The name was also used for the surrounding parish.

Statesman William Wentworth and his family lived in Petersham before moving into Vaucluse House, Wentworth selling his property in Petersham to Robert Wardell (1793–1834). Wardell purchased land from many grantees in the district and in 1831 his estate eventually stretched from Petersham to the Cooks River. Following his murder by escaped convicts in 1834, the estate was subdivided. The train line from Sydney to Parramatta opened in 1855 and trains stopped here from 1857. A platform was built in 1863. The original Petersham post office became Annandale in 1855. Another post office opened as Norwood in May 1860 and was moved to Petersham station in 1870. The first public school opened in 1878.

Petersham municipality was incorporated in 1872. The local council merged with Marrickville and St Peters in 1948 to form the Municipality of Marrickville. In 1916, the Boys&#x27; section of Fort Street High School moved to Petersham from Observatory Hill, followed by the Girls&#x27; section in 1975.

Oxford Tavern was opened in Petersham in 1882. It operated as a local tavern until its closure on 2 April 2023.

===Wartime plane crash===
Mosquito HR576 RAF (UK) disintegrated over the inner western Sydney suburbs of Leichhardt and Petersham on 2 May 1945 during an air test flight. The crew of two were killed but no one on the ground was seriously injured by the falling debris of the Mosquito. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of 3 May 1945 stated that two civilians were injured and a total of 18 properties were damaged. Five houses were set on fire by the falling debris.

It was suspected that a violent pull out from a power dive, with its associated high &#x27;g&#x27; forces may have led to the structural failure of the aircraft. The two crew members tried to escape from the aircraft but they were not high enough for their parachutes to open. Flight Lieutenant David Rochford of Oxford, England, and Leading Aircraftman (LAC) Charles Boydell from Mosman were both killed. Flight Lieutenant Rochford&#x27;s body was found in the playground of Petersham Public School while LAC Boydell&#x27;s body was found on the roof of a railway building about 100 metres away.

===Post-war period===
Petersham underwent significant development from the end of WWII. Many immigrants, particularly from Southern Europe, settled in the area, drawn by its proximity to Sydney&#x27;s city center and affordable housing. A significant number of Italian, Greek and Portuguese immigrants made their homes in Petersham, creating a vibrant multicultural community that influenced the local Mediterranean culture, food and social life. In the same period, the suburb&#x27;s Anglo-Australian population began to change and Petersham became known for its strong sense of community and a mix of old and new traditions.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Petersham began to gentrify, as many other areas inner-city Sydney. Older homes and terraced houses became more desirable to young professionals and artists, attracted by the proximity to the city, vibrant local culture, and relatively affordable property prices compared to other suburbs. In that period, there was a growing recognition of the area&#x27;s rich cultural diversity and historic character.

The late 20th century saw continued urban renewal and some commercial development in the area. The once industrial areas near the railway line began to transform into residential and mixed-use developments. Petersham&#x27;s proximity to Sydney&#x27;s CBD made it an increasingly attractive location for higher-income residents, leading to property prices and more upscale cafés, bars and cultural venues.

<text>Stanmore is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, in New South Wales, Australia 3 kilometres south west of the Sydney central business district. It is part of the local government area of the Inner West Council. It is known for its long strip of shops running along Parramatta Road (Great Western Highway).

==History==
Prior to settlement by the British, the site was populated by coastal Aboriginal peoples known as the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation. Land in the present Stanmore area was first allocated to colonial officers by Governor Arthur Phillip between 1793 and 1810.

Stanmore was named by a saddler, John Jones, who settled on the land in 1835 where Newington College now stands and called it the Stanmore Estate. Jones named it after his birthplace of Stanmore, now a north-west suburb of London. Thomas Rowley owned Kingston Farm which occupied the eastern half of Stanmore and much of Newtown, and a portion of George Johnston&#x27;s Annandale Farm estate covered the area south of Parramatta Road containing Annandale House built in 1799 on the hill between Macaulay and Albany Roads. Johnston marched from here with his troops to Castle Hill on 5 March 1804 to quell the convict revolt. He also rode from here on 26 January 1808 to arrest Governor William Bligh during the Rum Rebellion. Johnston planted the first Norfolk pines on the Australian mainland along the line of Percival Road, leading to Parramatta Road.

Stanmore Road was constructed in 1835 and early development occurred in this area. In 1855, the railway divided Stanmore into areas known as North and West Kingston north of the railway, and South Kingston south of the railway. The Kingston Farm had been sold to James Holt in 1835, and North Kingston was subdivided in 1854. South Kingston (between the railway and Stanmore Road) was slowly subdivided from 1857 with isolated large houses built between 1860 and 1870. It was not until the late 19th century that the name Stanmore came into more regular use, replacing Kingston. Municipal boundaries established in 1861 and 1871 placed most of Stanmore into the Municipality of Petersham, with the area south of Stanmore Rd placed into the Municipality of Marrickville. In 1878, Stanmore railway station was established and the streets west of Percival Road were laid out. More intensive development subsequently occurred in this area and the name Stanmore slowly moved northwards from Stanmore to Parramatta Roads. Stanmore became a desirable location, booming in the 1880s and 1890s with the opening of Newington College and the Percival Road shopping area. The naming of streets after English colonies between Derby and Stafford streets reflected the English values of the time. The final subdivision of Johnston&#x27;s South Annandale estate took place in 1905, and building was not completed until 1916-1918. Annandale House was demolished in 1905, and Weekley Park was established on land donated by the Johnston family.

A small amount of light industry was established in the early 1920s in the area close to Parramatta Road, including H. Small and Co., a chocolate maker opening in 1928, and Starkeys Cordials. Both establishments have since closed and their premises have been converted into offices and apartments.

<doc id="1236400" wikidata="Q3005483" url="?curid=1236400" title="Croydon, New South Wales">
<text>Croydon is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is located west of the Sydney central business district. Croydon is split between the two local government areas of Municipality of Burwood and the Inner West Council.

The suburb is nestled between the commercial centres of Ashfield and Burwood. It is bounded by Parramatta Road to the north, Iron Cove Creek to the east, Arthur Street to the south and a number of different streets to the west. To the north are Kings and Canada Bays on the closest reach of the Parramatta River, to the northwest is Concord Hospital and the Olympic Games complex at Homebush Bay. To the south is Canterbury Racecourse. The suburb shares its name with Croydon, a large district and borough in the south of London in the United Kingdom.

The traditional owners of the land on which Croydon is situated are the Wangal people of the Eora nation.

==History==
The suburb is named after Croydon, a town of London, England.

===Aboriginal anthropology===
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the area now known as Croydon was part of the land which the Wangal people lived. Their focus of tribal land was believed to be centred on Concord and stretched east to the swampland of Long Cove Creek. The land was heavily wooded at the time with tall eucalypts, blackbutts and turpentines covering the higher ground and mangroves, swamp oaks and swamp mahoganies in the lower swampy ground of Iron Cove Creek. The diet of the Wangal was primarily fish so they spent most of their time living near the shores of the Parramatta River and fishing in canoes. The land away from the river shores provided fruits, berries and edible plants as well as possums and kangaroos, which were killed both for food and their skins.

The arrival of the First Fleet in 1788 and the start of modern Australia had, as one could expect, an influence on the people living in the area. One of their leaders, Bennelong, befriended the first governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip, and was taken by him to England.

After establishing the colony at Sydney Cove in early 1788, a second settlement was established at Rose Hill (now called Parramatta) later that same year to establish farms to feed the people. Within a year or so, a rough land route had been established between the two settlements, traversing through the territory of the Cadigal, Wangal and Burramattagal people. This rough track later became the main artery of the expanding Greater Sydney and, as the northern boundary of what is now Croydon, influenced modern settlement in the area.

===Early British settlement===
Governor Phillip showed great reluctance to grant large amounts of land to his colonists, restricting land grants to the towns and people actively planning to farm the land. After his return to England in 1792, acting governor Major Francis Grose and his successor Captain William Paterson pursued the opposite policy granting large swathes of land to their friends prior to the arrival of the second official governor John Hunter in 1795.

The first land grant in the Croydon area was to Captain John Townson in April 1793 who received on Parramatta Road stretching west from Iron Cove Creek and south to what is now Queen Street. Further grants were made in 1794 to: Private J Eades (25 acres on Parramatta Road to the west of Townson&#x27;s holding); James Brackenrig (30 acres on the other side of Eades&#x27;s land); Augustus Alt, the first surveyor-general of NSW, (100 acres stretching south from Townson&#x27;s land to roughly what is now Thomas Street); and Sarah Nelson (15 acres west of the southern corner of Alt&#x27;s land in the area now known as Malvern Hill). Alt was the first to take up residence on his land, naming it &#x27;Hermitage Farm&#x27;. However, his house was burnt down by a group of indigenous people (possibly led by Pemulwuy) in 1797 and he didn&#x27;t return to Croydon, establishing himself in neighbouring Ashfield, and selling his property to John Palmer.

By 1820 a large part of the area had been subsumed by Joseph Underwood&#x27;s large &#x27;Ashfield Park Estate&#x27;. This property remained largely intact for more than 40 years, until it was subdivided into large blocks after the death of Elizabeth Underwood in 1858. By this time its proximity to the railway made it a desirable area (the station was originally called Fivedock). One of these subdivisions was the &#x27;Highbury Estate&#x27;, on part of which Anthony Hordern, son of the founder of the great retail firm, Anthony Hordern &amp; Sons, eventually built his house &#x27;Shubra Hall&#x27;, just beyond the west border of Ashfield. It later became part of the Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College, the current boundaries of which give an idea of the extent of the Hordern property. The College, including Shubra Hall, the main school building and the Meta Street entrance gates, is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.

From around 1800 to 1860, development in the area was slow with the forests gradually being cleared for orchards and grazing land. The area was a haunt of bushrangers in the 1820s with two major thoroughfares, Parramatta Road to the north and Liverpool Road to the south providing regular opportunities for holdups.

In 1855, the Sydney-Parramatta railway was built through the area which led to a housing boom around the stations at Ashfield and Burwood. This in turn led to local governments forming in the two areas with the land divided roughly equidistant between the two centres. In 1874 a new station was built on the boundary of the two areas and was named Five Dock after another settlement to the north. Because Five Dock was actually a long way north some confusion ensued and Ashfield Council renamed the station in 1876 to Croydon after the suburb in London. The suburb remains divided between the two neighbouring councils to this day.

===Population growth===

The first developments were on the northern side of the station around Edwin and Elizabeth Streets. Anthony Hordern built his grand home &#x27;Shubra Hall&#x27; in 1869 while many of the shops along Edwin Street North were built in the 1880s. Many houses in the areas surrounding Edwin Street North and Elizabeth St are also of the Victorian style popular in the 1880s and 90s. The 1880s and 90s also saw the establishment of the suburbs first schools with Croydon Public School in 1884, and the Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College relocating from Ashfield in 1891.

The southern side of Croydon remained largely undeveloped until the early 20th century. The Malvern Hill Estate was subdivided in 1909 and designed as a model suburb like Haberfield with wide tree-lined streets and houses built in the then-modern Federation style (a variation of Arts and crafts). Part of the development was the Strand shopping strip, which has survived intact to this day and is now heritage listed in its entirety.

Since World War I, little has changed in Croydon generally. While there have been some blocks of flats built in that time, they account for only around 10% of dwellings in Croydon and many of them are art deco blocks from the 1930s which fit in with the general heritage feel of the area.

From the end of World War II, Croydon saw significant growth with both population increases and suburban expansion. In that period, there was a major boom in residential development as people moved from the inner city to the outer suburbs in search of more affordable housing and larger homes. Many houses built during this era were typical of post-war suburban development, featuring modest bungalows and semi-detached homes.

== Heritage listings ==
Croydon has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Great Southern and Western railway: Croydon railway station
* Boundary Street: Shubra Hall
* Paisley Road: Croydon Sewer Vent

==Infrastructure==

=== Commercial area ===

Croydon&#x27;s principal commercial area is located around the railway station. The Strand, south of the railway line, is the primary commercial strip. It features a number of commercial properties, most of which contain residential units above them. A TAB, two real estate agencies, two grocery stores and various restaurants, cafés and bakeries are among the shops on The Strand. The older Edwin Street precinct, north of the line, consists mainly of specialist businesses such as an accounting firm, engineering firm, and printing shop. Some retailers on the southern side of Parramatta Road also fall just inside Croydon&#x27;s boundaries.
=== Health ===
From 1893 to 1994, the Western Suburbs Hospital was situated on the corner of Liverpool Road and Brighton Street. After remaining unoccupied for nearly 10 years, it was replaced in the early 2000s with a community health centre and two aged care facilities: Holy Spirit Croydon and The Brighton. Both of these facilities are operated by Catholic Health Australia, and each facility houses over 100 residents.

=== Education ===
Croydon has four schools: two primary and two secondary. The suburb&#x27;s oldest school is Croydon Public School, a primary, co-educational public school, established in 1883. Over 700 students currently attend the school, which is located on Young Street. The suburb&#x27;s other primary school is Holy Innocents Catholic Primary School, a Roman Catholic, co-educational primary school, established in 1924. It is a much smaller school than Croydon Public School, with a total enrolment of around 200 students. Holy Innocents is located on Queen Street opposite Burwood Girls High School which, despite its name and proximity to Burwood, is in fact situated within the boundaries of Croydon. Currently about 1200 students attend the secondary public school for girls, which was established in 1929.

Another school for girls is Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College, Sydney (PLC Sydney), an independent, Presbyterian, R-12, day and boarding school. The school was established in 1888 but did not move to its current Croydon location until 1891. Around 1150 girls currently attend the school. PLC Sydney is similar to the nearby Burwood Girls High School in that the vast majority of girls from both of these schools are not residents of Croydon, but instead travel to school from surrounding suburbs.

== Transport ==
Croydon railway station is served by the Inner West &amp; Leppington Line of the Sydney Trains network. Like most stations on the Inner West section of the line, it is served by all-stations services every fifteen minutes in both directions: east to the city and west to Homebush or Parramatta.

Seven bus services pass through Croydon:
* The 461 travels down Parramatta Road between Burwood and the city
* The 418 travels down Liverpool Road between Burwood and Kingsford
* The 480 and 483 also travel down Liverpool Road between Strathfield and the city
* The 490 and 492 travel from Drummoyne to Burwood via Queen Street, Croydon. They then travel through the southern part of Croydon with the 492 continuing on to Rockdale and the 490 continuing to Hurstville
* The 491 travels down Frederick Street and Elizabeth Street between Five Dock and Ashfield and then on to Hurstville

Croydon is sandwiched between two major roads: Parramatta Road and Liverpool Road. Within Croydon itself, there is only one road bridge (Meta St bridge) over the railway line which connects the north and south parts of the suburb.

Up until 1948, Croydon and neighbouring Croydon Park were also serviced by electric tram services running between Ashfield Station and the respective terminuses at Mortlake and Cabarita Park. These were subsequently replaced by routes 464 and 466.

== Landmarks ==
===Churches===

* All Saints of Russia is a Russian Orthodox Church, Chelmsford Avenue.
* Holy Innocents Catholic Church Webb Street
* Malvern Hill Uniting Church, designed by Alfred Newman.
* St Christophorous is a German-speaking Catholic Church in Edwin Street.
* St Gabriel Syrian Orthodox Church
* St Joseph&#x27;s Maronite Catholic Church
*St James&#x27; Anglican Church Croydon
* Sydney Missionary and Bible College
===Houses===
Croydon features many of the inner west&#x27;s most sought-after addresses due to its grand homes, larger blocks and family friendly streetscapes. As of 2011, the majority of dwellings were separate houses (63.6%). Croydon is a quiet village-like suburb with mostly detached housing built in the early part of the 20th century in what is known as Federation Bungalow or California Bungalow styles. The suburb caters for first-home buyers, while the wealthy may also find homes in the Malvern Hill Estate, a well-established pocket of prestigious homes that rarely come on the market and sell for more than $900,000. As of January 2016, the median house price of Croydon stood at $1,435,000.

The Malvern Hill area of Croydon was designed as a model suburb in 1906 by surveyors Atchison and Schleiser. Like the nearby Appian Way area in Burwood and the &#x27;garden suburb&#x27; Haberfield, the aim of the development was to have modern houses on large blocks of land with wide streets. Most of the houses are California Bungalows or similar Federation-era designs. Just east of Malvern Hill, in the Ashfield Council part of the suburb, is the grand Gads Hill Villa built by former Ashfield mayor Daniel Holborow and the nearby St James Anglican Church.

===Parks===

Centenary Park is a large open park with a barbecue area, bike tracks, play equipment, basketball court, two synthetic cricket nets and two playing fields that are used for cricket, rugby and football. Burwood Soccer Club and ACC Cricket Club play some home matches at the park. The Western Suburbs Leagues Bowling Club (Wests Sports) is located next door to the park. Also adjacent is the Bede Spillane Dog Park, situated on the corner of Croydon Road and Queen Street.

The other major sporting park in Croydon is Blair Park, which borders Burwood Girls High School and is situated just 200 metres west of Centenary Park. It contains one sporting field as well as a playground and a dog off-leash area, both adjacent to the sports field.

Wangal Park, situated directly north of Blair Park, is currently undergoing redevelopment by Burwood Council. The area, which was originally a brickpit, will feature three wetlands, boardwalks, educational signage and various amenities. Stage one of construction was opened in 2015, and works are expected to be complete in 2016.

Croydon is also home to various smaller parks and reserves: Reed Reserve, Froggatt Crescent Reserve, Prowse Reserve, Anthony Street Reserve, and Bridges Reserve.

==Population==

===Demographics===
According to the 2021 census, Croydon had a population of 10,755 people. It did not have the same level of high density housing found in its neighbours Ashfield and Burwood. 55.1% of dwellings were separate houses with 27.0% apartments and 17.2% terraces, semis or townhouses. The median age of people in the suburb was slightly older (42) than the rest of Sydney and a higher percentage of people owned their homes outright (34.7%) than those paying them off (31.4%). Median loan repayments ($2,700 per month) were much higher than the national figure ($1,8635).

Croydon still retains many of the characteristics of the broader Inner West region of Sydney, including a high proportion of residents born overseas. 31.3% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were China (excludes SARs and Taiwan) 16.5%, Italy 6.4%, Lebanon 4.3%, and Vietnam 3.4%. The most common ancestries were Chinese 23.2%, Australian 17.5%, English 17.3%, Italian 9.8% and Irish 8.8%. 51.1% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 11.9%, Cantonese 6.0%, Italian 4.7%, Arabic 4.0% and Greek 3.0%. The most common responses for religion were No religion 36.6%, Catholic 28.2%, Anglican 5.9%, Not stated 5.6% and Orthodox 5.0%.

==Politics==
At the federal level, Croydon is partly in the Division of Reid (north of the Hume Highway) and partly in the Division of Watson (south of the Hume Highway). Croydon was moved into Reid at the redistribution in 2016. Due to successive redistributions in 2009 and 2016 that moved the electorate eastward, Reid is a marginal electorate, largely inheriting the Inner West territory of the old Division of Lowe and retaining only a small part of the pre-2009 division of Reid in Western Sydney. 

At the state level, Croydon is in the NSW state electoral division of Strathfield. The state seat of Strathfield is also considered marginal. It was held by the Liberals until a redistribution in 1999 saw Labor&#x27;s Paul Whelan come into power. The seat was then held by Charles Casuscelli, Liberal Party member, until the election held in March 2015 when Jodi McKay won back the seat for the Labor Party.

The Croydon area by itself is considered a fairly safe Labor area. The adjacent table shows that when you just look at the polling booths in the suburb of Croydon, Labor has consistently returned around 60% of the two-party preferred vote even when the first preference votes have fluctuated. The Greens vote, while not as large as in other parts of the inner-west has been steadily increasing in recent years.

<doc id="1236402" wikidata="Q7929459" url="?curid=1236402" title="Viking Cup">
<text>The Viking Cup was a world ice hockey tournament in Camrose, Alberta. The prestigious Viking Cup international hockey tournament operated out of Camrose, with the Augustana Vikings as its host, between 1980 and 2006. 

The Viking Cup regularly featured national U-18 and other teams from Sweden, Finland, the United States, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Russia, with other European nations also making appearances.

Each of these countries brought with them different and unique styles of play, with the Cup serving as a venue for these different systems to be pitted against each other to their mutual benefit.

Junior and collegiate teams from the United States and Canada also participated in the Viking Cup. Each tournament served as an opportunity for scouts from the professional ranks, including the NHL, to lay eyes on some of the top young hockey talent from around the world. Over 400 tournament alumni had their names called during NHL drafts.

Eventual NHL stars Dominik Hašek, Joe Pavelski, Paul Stastny, Olli Jokinen, Andrei Markov, Sergei Zubov, Miikka Kiprusoff, Tomáš Vokoun, James Patrick, Žigmund Pálffy, Patrik Eliáš, Mikko Koivu, Sergei Gonchar, Henrik Lundqvist, Henrik Zetterberg, and Tuuka Rask rank among the Cup&#x27;s most decorated alumni.

The Viking Cup built upon Camrose’s existing decorated history of hosting hockey trailblazers. The 1974–75 Camrose Lutheran College Vikings shocked the hockey world when they emerged from a tiny rural school to win the first-ever Canadian Colleges Athletic Association hockey championships in Sydney, Nova Scotia.

Problems developed in the late 1990s as the Canadian Jr. A teams, which were popular with fans, were allowed to play with some 20-year-old players. This upset the European teams (which were all Under-18) and led to unbalanced games with the North American teams dominating their younger European opponents.

<text>Burwood is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is west of the Sydney central business district and is the administrative centre for the local government area of Municipality of Burwood. 

Burwood Heights is a separate suburb to the south. The Appian Way is a street in Burwood, known for its architecturally designed Federation-style homes.

==History==
Archaeological evidence indicates people were living in the Sydney area for at least 11,000 years. This long association had led to a harmonious relationship between the indigenous inhabitants and their environment, which was interrupted by the arrival of the British in 1788. The European desire to cultivate the land aided and abetted by a smallpox epidemic that forced the local people, the Wangal clan, away from their source of food and their spiritual connection with the land.

Captain Thomas Rowley (1748–1806) received a grant of in 1799, and called his property Burwood Farm after Burwood Park, England. Following more land grants, his estate increased to . The grant stretched from Parramatta Road to where Nicholson Street and The Boulevarde are today and eastwards where to Croydon railway station is now. This is where he ran merino sheep on the property.

The first house, Burwood Villa, was built in the area in 1814, the same year that a stagecoach began running between Sydney and Parramatta. Burwood became a staging post along the road and the beginnings of a settlement started to develop. One of its most prominent early residents was Dr. John Dulhunty, a former naval surgeon who was appointed the Superintendent of Police for the Colony of New South Wales after his arrival in Sydney from England in 1826. Dr. Dulhunty became famous in the colony for fighting a gang of bushrangers that attacked his residence, Burwood House. He died suddenly in the house in 1828 but his son, Robert Dulhunty, went on to become the founder of the New South Wales regional city of Dubbo.

Subdivisions in the Burwood area in the 1830s propelled the growth of a village and by 1855, when the railway line opened, Burwood was one of the initial six stops on the Sydney-to-Parramatta route. The railway led to a huge growth in population. In 1874, the area became a municipality.

== Landmarks ==

Burwood features many fine examples of architecture from the Victorian and Federation styles. St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church on Burwood Road was designed by colonial architect Edmund Blacket and built in 1871. Sir Donald Bradman and Lady Bradman, Jessie Menzies were married here in 1932. The church and its pipe organ is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register and on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.

Nearby Woodstock in Church Street was built in the early 1870s by tobacco manufacturer Edwin Penfold. In the 1940s, it was taken over by the army, later becoming Broughton Migrant Hostel, before being bought by the council in 1974 for use as a community centre. Radio station 2RDJ-FM has been broadcasting from Woodstock since November 1983.

Further south on Burwood Road is &quot;The Priory&quot;, built in 1877 by local councillor Mowbray Forrest, and Gayton, built in 1888 by NSW parliamentarian Richard Jones. St Nectarios Greek Orthodox Church in Railway Parade was formerly a Methodist church and was built in 1879, listed on the local government heritage list.

Running between Burwood Road and Liverpool Road is The Appian Way, a model housing estate conceived by George Hoskins at the turn of the century. The street has been described as one of the finest streets of Federation houses in Australia and is listed on the local government heritage list. In the centre of the Appian Way is a communal reserve which was converted into a lawn tennis club.

<doc id="1236406" wikidata="Q1422799" url="?curid=1236406" title="Centennial Airport">
<text>Centennial Airport is a public use airport owned by the Arapahoe County Public Airport Authority in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area, 15 nautical miles (17 mi, 28 km) southeast of downtown Denver, Colorado, United States. Located in Dove Valley, a census designated place in Arapahoe County, the airport&#x27;s runways extend into Douglas County.

== Facilities==
The airport opened on May 12, 1968, as Arapahoe County Airport, and was renamed on July 13, 1984. The new name reflects Colorado&#x27;s admission to the Union as the 38th state in 1876, the centennial of the United States Declaration of Independence.

In 1985 a new control tower was built. It is an international airport with continuous U.S. Customs services and is one of the busiest general aviation airports in the United States with an average of 874 operations per day. The Federal Aviation Administration control tower provides air traffic control service 24/7. Runway 35R has an instrument landing system.

Centennial Airport covers 1,400 acres (567 ha) at an elevation of 5,885 feet (1,794 m). It has three asphalt runways: 17L/35R is 10,000 by 100 feet (3,048 x 30 m); 17R/35L is 7,001 by 77 feet (2,134 x 23 m); 10/28 is 4,800 by 75 feet (1,463 x 23 m). In 2018 the airport had 337,947 aircraft operations, averaging 925 per day: 89% general aviation, 10% air taxi, and 2% military. 840 aircraft were then based at this airport: 569 single-engine, 104 multi-engine, 147 jets, and 20 helicopters.

Key Lime Air has its corporate headquarters on the airport property. Air Methods did as well prior to moving to nearby Greenwood Village in 2017.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized the airport as a &quot;reliever airport&quot;.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Cargo===
==Accidents and Incidents==
*On November 19, 1979, a Cessna 500 Citation I operated by National Jet industries, a cargo flight, crashed on an improper IFR approach to runway 34 due to icing conditions. Two of the three occupants died.
*On July 2, 1984, a Bell 206B helicopter, &quot;N3173L&quot;, suddenly rolled over and crashed at Centennial Airport, killing the pilot and single passenger. Investigators found that the connector that retained the cyclic stick had broken due to a loose retaining nut, and attributed the accident to improper maintenance, with the manufacturer&#x27;s inadequate preflight checklist being a contributing factor. Fifteen days after the crash, Bell Helicopter issued a safety notice advising operators to check quick removal flight controls for proper installation prior to flight—guidance which was previously omitted from the manufacturer&#x27;s checklists.
* On March 26, 2001, a Socata TBM-700, &quot;N300WC&quot;, departed shortly after 07:00 local time under IFR rules in low-ceiling ice fog conditions. Radar and on-board GPS data indicated the airplane began drifting to the left of runway centerline almost immediately after takeoff. The airplane made a climbing left turn, achieving a maximum altitude of 7,072 feet and completing 217 degrees of turn, before beginning a descending left turn. The airplane impacted terrain on airport property and was destroyed, killing the only occupant, the pilot.
* On December 17, 2004, a Cessna 421, &quot;N421FR&quot;, drifted to the right on takeoff from runway 17L, crossing the median and runway 17R, then suddenly rolled very steeply to the right, struck the ground with the right wing low, and cartwheeled. The aircraft was destroyed and the three occupants—a student pilot, a flight instructor, and a second instructor riding as a passenger—were killed. Ground witnesses reported that the pilots made several unsuccessful attempts to start the engines, and discussed taking the aircraft to a shop for repairs, but ultimately got the engines running and initiated the flight. Investigators found fuel system anomalies indicative of a fuel line blockage, and attributed the accident to a loss of engine power due to fuel starvation, and to the flight instructor&#x27;s failure to perform proper emergency procedures and abort the flight.
* On May 12, 2021, a Cirrus SR22 and Key Lime Air Flight 970, a Swearingen SA226-TC Metroliner operating a charter cargo flight, collided on approach to Centennial Airport. The Cirrus made a safe off-airport parachute-assisted landing, while the Key Lime pilot landed safely at Centennial despite the loss of a section of the cabin roof, damage to the empennage, and failure of one engine. There were no injuries.
* On June 16, 2021, a Lancair Evolution plane crashed south of Centennial while on final approach. The plane collided with several power lines and started a brush fire which was contained by fire crews. The two occupants and a dog were killed in the crash.
*On August 9, 2022, a Cessna 182 Skylane crashed off the departure end of Runway 10. The sole pilot on board was killed. The final determination of the cause of the crash is pending; tentative reports indicate the aircraft was flown without the owner&#x27;s knowledge and that the pilot had yet to complete a checkout flight on the type before being certified. According to a witness, the aircraft climbed to 150-200 feet AGL, sputtered, nosed down and impacted. There was no fire. The aircraft had no mechanical issues but had almost no fuel in the tanks.

<doc id="1236407" wikidata="Q676506" url="?curid=1236407" title="Passbook">
<text>A passbook or bankbook is a paper book used to record bank or building society transactions on a deposit account.

Traditionally, a passbook was used for accounts with a low transaction volume, such as savings accounts. A bank teller or postmaster would write the date, amount of the transaction, and the updated balance and enter his or her initials by hand. In the late 20th century, small dot matrix or inkjet printers were introduced that were capable of updating the passbook at the account holder&#x27;s convenience, either at an ATM or a passbook printer, either in a self-serve mode, by post, or in a branch.

==History==
Passbooks appeared in the 18th century, allowing customers to hold transaction information in their own hands for the first time. Until then, transactions were recorded in ledgers at the bank only, so customers had no history of their own deposits and withdrawals.

The passbook, which was around the size of a passport, ensured that customers had control over their own information, and was called a &quot;passbook&quot; because it was used as a way to identify the account holder without needing further identification. It also regularly passed between the bank and the account holder for updating.
==Usage==
===Credits and deposits===
To add credit to an account by bringing cash to a bank in person, the account holder can fill a small &quot;credit slip&quot; or &quot;deposit slip&quot;. The total value of notes and coins is counted and entered on the slip, along with the date and the payer&#x27;s name. The cash and details are counted and checked by the teller at the bank; if everything is in order, the deposit is credited to the account, the &quot;credit slip&quot; is then kept by the bank, and the &quot;credit slip booklet&quot; is stamped with the date and then returned to the account holder. An account holder uses his passbook to record their history of transactions with his bank.

===Debits and withdrawals===
Withdrawals normally required the account holder to visit the branch where the account was held, where a &quot;debit slip&quot; or &quot;withdrawal slip&quot; would be prepared and signed. If the teller did not know the account holder, the signature on the slip and the authorities would be checked against the signature card at the branch, before money was paid out. In the 1980s, banks adopted the black light signature system for passbooks, which enabled withdrawals to be made from passbooks at a branch other than the one where an account was opened, unless prior arrangements were made to transfer the signature card to the other branch. Under this system, the passbook&#x27;s owner would sign in the back of the passbook in an invisible ink and the signing authorities would also be noted. At the paying branch, the signature on the withdrawal slip would be checked against the signature in the book, which required a special ultraviolet reader to read. Today, the customer is more commonly verified by PIN and commonly through an automated teller machine.

==Direct banking==

For people who feel uneasy with telephone or online banking, the use of a passbook is an alternative to obtain, in real-time, the account activity without waiting for a bank statement. However, unlike some bank statements, some passbooks offer fewer details, replacing easy-to-understand descriptions with short codes.

<doc id="1236419" wikidata="Q2381126" url="?curid=1236419" title="Shalya">
<text>In the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, King Shalya (, lit. &quot;Pike&quot;) was the brother of Madri (mother of Nakula and Sahadeva), and the ruler of the Madra kingdom. Skilled with the mace and a formidable warrior, he was tricked by Duryodhana to fight the war on the side of the Kauravas. He was encouraged to serve as the charioteer of Karna by Duryodhana. Shalya was an incredibly calm and deliberate fighter, his level-headedness and prowess in warfare making him a great warrior in spite of his slight build.

==Becoming Pandu&#x27;s brother-in-law==

On his way to Hastinapura, King Pandu encountered Shalya&#x27;s army. At parlay, Shalya and his general met with Pandu; Pandu was very impressed by Shalya&#x27;s slight general and became friends. Bhishma, head of Pandu&#x27;s family, learned of Shalya&#x27;s beautiful sister, Mādrī and decided to arrange Pandu&#x27;s second marriage with Madri. Shalya agreed and was gifted with gold and jewels from Hastinapura.

===Attempt to make Nakula and Sahadeva his heirs===

Years after Madri had decided to self-immolate herself, Shalya invited his nephews Nakula and Sahadeva to Madra, wishing to make them his heirs. On their eighteenth birthday, Shalya revealed his intention to the twins. Shalya argued that Nakula could be a king one day, instead of fourth-in-line to the throne of Hastinapura, provided that Yudhishthira would be named the crown prince. Nakula supposed that Shalya only wished to anoint Nakula and Sahadeva as his heirs because they were both children of deities, and that Shalya was rejecting his own children from the line of succession with this gambit. Nakula admitted that while Sahadeva and he staying with the Pandavas would give them no power, his brothers and Kunti genuinely loved him, and would never try to make Nakula and Sahadeva their pawns. After some deliberation, Nakula was convinced that Shalya had no ulterior motives. Sahadeva and he agreed to become the heirs to Shalya&#x27;s throne, on the condition that they would always stay with the rest of the Pandavas.

==Kurukshetra War==
===Falling prey to Duryodhana&#x27;s trick===
When Shalya heard of the impending Kurukshetra War, he marched forth with his army to join his nephews. On the way, Shalya was tricked by Duryodhana, who arranged a huge feast for Shalya and his men, entertaining him for hours. Impressed, Shalya was generous with his praise and asks to see Yudhishthira, who Shalya thought was his host. When Duryodhana revealed the treachery, Shalya is astounded but is compelled to grant a boon due to the hospitality. Unable to turn down Duryodhana&#x27;s request to join the Kauravas, Shalya met the Pandavas and apologised for his mistake. Nakula and Sahadeva grew enraged, saying that Shalya had truly proven that Nakula and Sahadeva were not real brothers to the Pandavas, but only step-brothers. Yudhishthira quickly stepped in and reprimanded the twins, commanding that they were never to again cheapen their relationship by saying they were &quot;step&quot; brothers. At this point, Shalya realised that he had underestimated their brotherly bond. Yudhishthira promised to Shalya that he would kill him during the eve of the war.

=== Yudhisthira&#x27;s plan against Karna ===
Prior to the start of the war, Yudhishthira met with his elders on the Kaurava side, seeking their blessings. Shalya readily offered his blessings to Yudhishthira, wishing him victory. Shalya was requested by Yudhishthira to heap praises of his brothers in order to infuriate Karna.

===1st-13th days===

Though not spirited in his fight, Shalya confronted many great warriors during the war. On the first day, he attacks Yudhishthira and snaps his bow. However, Yudhishthira takes another bow and wounds Shalya. Shalya killed Uttara Kumara on the first day of the war. He killed the boy with his spear after a fantastic duel, and subsequently hailed his brave death. On the second day, his eldest son Madranjaya is killed by Virata as revenge for Uttara.

===13th-17th days===
On the 13th day, Shalya&#x27;s sons Rukmangada and Rukmaratha were killed by Abhimanyu; Shalya himself is helpless against Abhimanyu&#x27;s attacks. On the 14th day, he tries to stop Arjuna’s advance towards Jayadratha but is defeated; injured so badly that he cannot even sit down. During the night battle at the end of the day, he vanquishes Virata and makes him flee.

===Karna&#x27;s charioteer===

On 16th day of battle, Karna defeated, but spared the lives of Nakula and Sahadeva, stating that they are younger and not his equals, therefore not deserving of death by his hands. He proceeded to clash with Arjuna, having previously promised Kunti that he would not attempt to slay any Pandava except Arjuna. During the course of the battle, Karna invoked the Ashwasena snake on his arrow and directed it towards Arjuna. However, Shalya advised him to aim it at Arjuna&#x27;s chest. Karna disregarded his advice, as he had already aimed the arrow towards Arjuna&#x27;s head and said that changing the target of a bow right before firing it is not a brave act. Krishna drove Arjuna&#x27;s chariot into the earth, saving Arjuna&#x27;s life, as the arrow destroyed Arjuna&#x27;s crown which was given to him by Indra.

On the 17th day, unarmed and on foot, Karna is killed by Arjuna. After Karna&#x27;s demise, Shalya would console the grieving Duryodhana by reminding him that Karna&#x27;s death was inevitable. Duryodhana subsequently named Shalya as the new commander-in-chief of the Kaurava forces.

== Death ==

After Shalya is named the new commander-in-chief for the Kaurava forces, Krishna suggested that Yudhishthira should kill the powerful warrior, as the eldest Pandava was not a man of aggression and could meet Shalya&#x27;s aggressive demeanor in battle. Yudhishthira engages Shalya in an long archery duel. With the assistance of Bhima, Yudhishthira deprives Shalya of his charioteer and horses. In a fit of rage, Shalya rushes towards Yudhishthira with a sword and shield in hand. Using his arrows, Bhima destroys Shalya’s weapons but Shalya undeterred by this, proceeds towards Yudhishthira with the intent of killing him with his bare hands. After fighting with the mace, spear and by the means of archery, Yudhishtira took his javelin (which was once used by Shiva to kill the demon Andhaka) and hurled it at Shalya. That divine weapon struck squarely on his leg and Shalya was injured, the bhargavasta shot by Yudhistira from the Vijay bow hit him in the chest and he died.

<text>Lowry [[Air Force Base]] (Lowry Field from 1938–1948) is a former United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) training base during World War II and a United States Air Force (USAF) training base during the Cold War. From 1955-1958, it served as the initial site of the U.S. Air Force Academy. It is a U.S. Formerly Used Defense Site (B08CO0505).

==Background==
The City of Denver, Auraria, and Highland was chartered as the 1859 territorial capital after the start of the 1858 Pike&#x27;s Peak gold rush. In 1887, Fort Logan was established in the modern Denver Metropolitan Area. East of the state capital, military training at Montclair, Colorado, began at the future airfield when the 1887 Jarvis Hall Military School opened. Montclair was incorporated into Denver in 1903 and Jarvis Hall burned down in 1904. At the military school site the Agnes Phipps Memorial Sanatorium was established as a tuberculosis hospital in 1904 at 520 Rampart Way (cf. &quot;East 6th Avenue and Quebec Street&quot;) by Lawrence C. Phipps Sr., and in the 1930s the sanatorium included 17 buildings designed by the Gove and Walsh firm.

&quot;After several fires at Chanute Field and deterioration of the buildings&quot; in Illinois, a 1934 Air Corps announcement solicited a replacement training location and Denver submitted a bid. The City of Denver purchased the sanatorium for an airfield after a 1935 municipal bond vote. On 27 August 1937, the Denver Branch, Air Corps Technical School, was formed with Departments of Photography and Armament (&quot;photography training moved from Chanute Field&quot;), and the WPA converted the sanatorium grounds into a Colorado military airfield. In February 1938 the airfield being installed adjacent to Fairmont Cemetery was assigned to the Air Corps Technical School headquartered at Chanute, and &quot;the Denver branch of the Army Air Corps became an Army post of 880 acres.&quot;

==Original Lowry Field==
The name Lowry Field was originally assigned to an airfield consisting of property taken over by the Colorado National Guard, having a southern border along East 38th Avenue between Dahlia &amp; Holly Streets. It was named for Second Lieutenant Francis Lowry, the only Colorado pilot killed in combat in World War I. The airfield was used by the 120th Observation Squadron, 45th Division Aviation. In 1924, the 120th began flying Curtiss JN-4Es (better known as Jennies) at the new airfield.

A 28 October 1926 photo shows the Fokker BA-1 trimotor Josephine Ford of the Byrd Arctic Expedition being refueled at the original Lowry Field. Charles Lindbergh and his Spirit of St. Louis made a scheduled stop at Lowry on 1 September 1927 during his 48 state sponsored tour. Jack Taylor died on the maiden voyage of the Cheyenne-Pueblo-Denver contract airmail route from Lowry to Cheyenne when his aircraft exploded on 10 December 1927. He was flying a large Douglas mail plane for Western Air Express Inc. near Lowry.

During the latter part of 1937 the name &quot;Lowry Field&quot; was transferred from the Colorado National Guard facility to the new Denver Branch, Air Corps Technical School. In early 1938, after about a year of overlapping operations, the 120th Observation Squadron moved to their new quarters at the Denver Municipal Airport; remaining there until mobilization for World War II took place on 6 January 1941. The 19 officers and 116 enlisted members of the squadron then moved to Biggs Army Airfield, Texas.

In 1938, the former Lowry Field was renamed Combs Field when Harry B. Combs began leasing the airfield. He and a partner opened Mountain State Aviation, a fixed-base operation and flight training facility. Mountain State would go on to train over 9,000 pilots for World War II through the Civilian Pilot Training Program at the location. In 1936, Combs had joined the 120th Observation Squadron, flying the 0-19 E variant and gaining enough flying time to earn his instructor’s rating.

==Lowry Field==
Lowry Field was assigned to the new Army Air Field on 11 March 1938. Photographic courses began prior to the field&#x27;s completion and runway paving. The paved runway opened on 4 April (first used by a B-18 Bolo). The sanatorium&#x27;s main building became the Army post&#x27;s headquarters, and the largest single barracks (3,200 men) was completed in mid-1940. The &quot;Northeast-Southwest runway was completed in 1941&quot; and on 1 March 1941, the Air Corps Technical School moved an &quot;A.A.F. Clerical School&quot; for Air Corps Clerks (384 hours) to Fort Logan from Lowry. Beginning 16 July 1940, the 1st class of the AAF bombardier schools was at Lowry and used the nearby bombing and gunnery range through 14 March 1941, graduating three classes of instructors who opened the Barksdale Field bombardier school.

==Fourth Technical Training District==
Lowry training for Boeing B-29 Superfortress pilot qualification and for B-29 operational crew readiness began in 1943, and the base had a July 1943–Jan 1944 clerical school. In 1944 expansion of Lowry&#x27;s airfield was planned and Lowry gained B-29 Flight Engineer training.

Lowry transferred under Technical Training Command in mid-October 1945 (Air Training Command on 1 July 1946) and by the end of 1945, Lowry&#x27;s separation center was processing an average of 300 discharges a day. The nearby bombing range was transferred from Buckley Field, by authority of Technical Division, Air Training Command, to Lowry A.F.B. on 20 September 1946. In July 1947, formal courses in Intelligence Training were established at Lowry for combat reporting, photographic intelligence, prisoner of war interrogation, and briefing and interrogation of combat crews.

==USAF base==
Lowry Air Force Base was designated on 24 June 1948 and on 26 August 1948 established all Lowry training organizations under the 3415th Technical Training Wing (redesignated &quot;Lowry Technical Training Center&quot; on 1 Jan 1959). Lowry provided Operation Hayride emergency response for people and livestock threatened by eighteen December 1948January 1949 snowstorms from Utah to Kansas (e.g., a C-47 of the 2151st Air Rescue Unit delivered 115 blankets and 30 cases of C rations on 4 January to 482 people at Rockport, Colorado.) By 25 August 1949, the 3903rd Radar Bomb Scoring Squadron had a unit based at Lowry which operated a Strategic Air Command radar station (Lowry&#x27;s radar annex was at Genesee Mountain Park.)

In 1951, plans called for the headquarters of Technical Training Air Force to be at Lowry and after expansion at the beginning of the Korean War, Lowry courses included photography, armament, rocket propulsion, electronics, radar-operated fire-control systems, computer specialties, gun and rocket sights, and electronically operated turret systems. The 3415th Wing formed a Guided Missiles Department on 7 June 1951 and from 1952 – 1955, Lowry functioned as President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s Summer White House. Beginning in September 1954, the 3415th TTW moved intelligence, comptroller, and transportation training programs to Sheppard AFB. On 11 July 1955, the first class of 306 USAF Academy cadets was sworn in at Lowry.

In 1956 Lowry&#x27;s bombing range support ended when the bombing range mission was terminated and Lowry&#x27;s first general courses for missiles were developed. Courses were for Falcon, Rascal, Snark, and Navajo missiles and in 1958, Nuclear Weapons Training. Also early in 1958, the USAF concluded that the new NORAD headquarters (different from the planned Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunkers for NORAD and the Denver ADS) should be relocated from Ent AFB to Lowry AFB (CO Springs&#x27; Chidlaw Building became the new NORAD HQ). In 1960, Lowry was the 3rd ranked technical training base of ATC.

==ICBM headquarters and training==
The Air Force Ballistic Committee, formed in 1955, approved the former bombing range on 13 March 1958 for the first Titan I ICBM launch complex (the Titan missile plant was built at Waterton Canyon.) The 703d Strategic Missile Wing was activated on 25 September 1958 and redesignated the 451 SMW on 1 July 1961, at the same time the 848th and the 849 SMS were redesignated the 724th and 725 SMS. Construction on all nine silos at the three launch complexes for the 724 was completed by 4 August 1961. On 18 April 1962, Headquarters SAC declared the 724th SMS operational, and 2 days later the first Titan Is went on alert status. A month later, the sister 725th SMS (initially designated the 849th SMS) declared it had placed all nine of its Titan Is on alert status, which marked a SAC first. Both the 724th and 725th Strategic Missile Squadrons formed components of the Lowry-headquartered 451st Strategic Missile Wing. The &quot;original class of instructors&quot; for the Mace missile course at Lowry graduated from the &quot;G.L. Martin factory training course in Baltimore MD in 1960&quot; and by early 1961, Lowry&#x27;s personnel course moved to Greenville AFB.

By 1962, Lowry&#x27;s Department of Missile Training was graduating over 1,000 trained missile specialists per year, and the &quot;Tactical Missile School at Lowry&quot; (e.g., for Matador missile training) in January 1962 &quot;was located in the Black Hangar.&quot; On 25 June 1965, the 724th and 725th Strategic Missile Squadrons were inactivated, and the last missile supported by Lowry was removed on 14 April 1965.

==Air Intelligence Training Center==

The Armed Forces Air Intelligence Training Center was established at Lowry effective 1 July 1963 with student training beginning on 17 July (by 14 March, &quot;the Defense Department had assigned responsibility for all DOD air intelligence training and advanced training in photographic, radar, and infrared interpretation to the Air Force.&quot;) In 1965, the runway was closed, and all Lowry AFB flying activities moved to nearby Buckley Air National Guard Base. Ten courses from Amarillo AFB were planned to be moved to Lowry in mid-1968, and Amarillo&#x27;s 3320th Retraining Group for convicted airmen moved to Lowry 1 July1 September 1967. In 1974, the Air Staff approved Lackland AFB&#x27;s Special Treatment Center to transfer to the 3415th Special Training Group at Lowry AFB. In addition to Air Force personnel, the U.S. Navy also sent junior officers (ensigns and lieutenants) for initial intelligence training at Lowry, along with enlisted personnel newly graduated from boot camp for their &quot;A&quot; school instruction as intelligence specialists.

Construction began in 1970 for enlisted and officer billeting facilities to replace World War II vintage barracks, five 1,000-man dormitories and completed by 1974, a 187-space mobile home park. Other added facilities included a youth center, a child-care center, a chapel (in addition to the 1941 chapel), and a new Airmen&#x27;s Open Mess. In 1976, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (formerly Air Force Accounting &amp; Finance Center) &amp; the Air Reserve Personnel Center opened in the Gilchrist Building (Building 444).

The AFAITC school remained at Lowry from 1963 to 1988, before moving to Goodfellow AFB, in San Angelo, Texas. US Navy intelligence training for both junior officers and enlisted personnel was shifted to the new Navy Marine Corps Intelligence Training Center (NMITC) at Dam Neck, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

==USAF School of Applied Aerospace Sciences, Lowry==
In 1972, the 3415th Technical Wing became the USAF School of Applied Aerospace Sciences, Lowry. The Department of Aerospace Munitions Training continued missile training and in 1978 was redesignated the 3460th Training Group. In 1980 Lowry acquired a Davis-Monthan AFB B-52D and stabilized another B-52 for training ALCM and SRAM loading procedures. New courses in the 1970s and 1980s included flight line and in-shop avionics maintenance courses for the F-4 Phantom II, F-111 Aardvark, A-10 Warthog, F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon (e.g., communications, flight controls, navigation, weapons guidance, and electronic countermeasures &amp; warfare systems). In 1982, Lowry&#x27;s 1941 Eisenhower Memorial Chapel (cf. the Eisenhower Chapel at Fort Knox) was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The National Geospatial Agency&#x27;s Integrated Operations Center was in Denver and by 1983, Lowry had the Air Intelligence Officer Course

LGM-118 Peacekeeper ICBM training began at Lowry in 1985, and after Lowry became the primary training center for USAF space operations, Undergraduate Space Training&#x27;s 1st graduation was in 1987. The 3301st Undergraduate Space Training unit moved to Vandenberg AFB, CA in 1991, prior to Lowry AFB closure. Lowry also handled ground &amp; armament training for several interceptor models, the A-10 Thunderbolt II, and the B-1 Lancer.

After being considered for closure in 1978 and since &quot;Lowry lacked a runway&quot; (all runways closed and all USAF flight operations terminated, July 1966), Lowry AFB was designated for closure by BRAC 1991. The 3400th Technical Training Wing inactivated on 27 April 1994, and the base officially closed on 30 September 1994. The National Civilian Community Corps used Lowry facilities from 1994 until 2004; and Space Systems Support Group Detachment 1 &quot;located at the former Lowry AFB&quot; in March 1995 moved to Peterson AFB. The Bonfils Blood Center &quot;became the first commercial tenant at Lowry&quot; in the former commissary during September 1995, and the site development company was presented facility and real estate awards in 1997 (asbestos was remediated from the Formerly Used Defense Site of &quot;1,866 acres&quot;—remediation at buildings included Building 402:PCBs, 606: groundwater, &amp; 1432: soil).

==Closure==
The Buckley Annex was the remaining military installation after the &quot;Whole Base Transfer&quot; of Lowry AFB in 2006, the year the USGS listed the closed Lowry AFB in the Geographic Names Information System. In 2007, the annex of with DFAS &amp; ARPC was planned for closure. The last remaining Air Force facility at Lowry was the Air Reserve Personnel Center, which BRAC 2005 moved to Buckley AFB in August 2011. The Buckley Annex&#x27; Whole Base Transfer was in 2012, and the &quot;final stages of cleanup&quot; of the base and annex were underway in February 2013.

Most of the base is now the Lowry, Denver, neighborhood with 2 hangars used for the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum, the former Building 1499 for the Big Bear Ice Rink, a dormitory for the Logan School for Creative Learning, and base officer housing and other facilities for the Stanley British Primary School. A dormitory and a former medical building on the east end of the base are owned by the state as part of the Higher Education and Technology campus. The last remaining military facility at the former Lowry base was the Defense Finance and Accounting Service Finance Center (6760 E Irvington Place), which had its own USAF Base Facility identifier in 2004 (08002D). The Lowry Community Master Association (LCMA) is located at 7581 E Academy Blvd, the former hangar with the name &quot;Lowry Air Force Base&quot; and which also has suites for Martifer Solar USA, Mor Beverage Corp, Montessori Casa International, and Extra Space Storage. Bishop Machebeuf Catholic high school is located in the Lowry neighborhood.

<doc id="1236440" wikidata="Q5159999" url="?curid=1236440" title="Confessional Lutheranism">
<text>Confessional Lutheranism is a name used by Lutherans to designate those who believe in the doctrines taught in the &quot;Book of Concord&quot; of 1580 (the Lutheran confessional documents) in their entirety. Confessional Lutherans maintain that faithfulness to the &quot;Book of Concord,&quot; which is a summary of the teachings found in Scripture, requires attention to how that faith is actually being preached, taught, and put into practice. Confessional Lutherans believe that this is a vital part of their identity as Lutherans.

The term Confessional Lutheran is generally used among the more conservative churches found in groupings such as the International Lutheran Council (ILC), the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC), and the Global Confessional and Missional Lutheran Forum, though other Confessional Lutheran denominations are independent of the same. Churches of the larger Lutheran World Federation subscribe to the &quot;Book of Concord&quot; as an exposition of faith in so far as (&quot;quatenus&quot;) it agrees with their interpretation of the Bible.

==History==
Two main confessional movements arose during the 19th century: the Old Lutherans and the Neo-Lutherans. The Old Lutherans originated from the Schism of the Old Lutherans, while Neo-Lutheranism arose in Germany in the 1830s from the Pietist driven &quot;Erweckung&quot; (&quot;Awakening&quot;). Neo-Lutheranism itself contained differing camps. It gave rise later to those calling themselves confessional Lutherans.

Neo-Lutheranism developed in reaction to Pietism on the one side and Rationalism on the other, both of which had arisen in the previous century. German clergymen such as Martin Stephan, C. F. W. Walther, F. C. D. Wyneken, and Wilhelm Loehe became a part of the movement as they studied the works of Martin Luther and the &quot;Book of Concord&quot;.

The Old Lutheran and Neo-Lutheran movements spread to the United States with the Neo-Lutheran Loehe and the Old Lutheran free church leader Friedrich August Brünn, both sending missionaries to newly arrived German immigrants in the Midwest, and with the immigration of groups including the Saxons who settled in Missouri under Martin Stephan and C. F. W. Walther, the Germans who settled in Indiana under F. C .D. Wyneken, and the Prussians under J. A. A. Grabau in Western New York and southeastern Wisconsin (the Buffalo Synod).

In Scandinavia, where High Church Lutheranism and Pietist Lutheranism has been highly influential, the Evangelical Lutheran Mission Diocese of Finland, Mission Province of the Church of Sweden, and the Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of Norway entered into schism with their national churches due to &quot;the secularization of the national/state churches in their respective countries involving matters of both Christian doctrine and ethics&quot;; these are members of the International Lutheran Council with their bishops having secured their lines of apostolic succession from other traditional Lutheran Churches, such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Kenya.

==Church bodies using the title &quot;confessional&quot;==
Contemporary Lutheran church bodies that identify themselves as confessional tend to be either members of the International Lutheran Council, the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference, the Global Confessional and Missional Lutheran Forum, or certain other independent Lutheran bodies. Among the members of the ILC are the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, the Lutheran Church–Canada, the Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Germany, the Lutheran Church of Australia, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Brazil. Among the CELC are the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod and the Evangelical Lutheran Synod. Other confessional Lutherans include the Church of the Lutheran Confession, the American Association of Lutheran Churches, the Concordia Lutheran Conference, the Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of North America, member congregations of the Protes&#x27;tant Conference, and member congregations of the Orthodox Lutheran Confessional Conference of Independent Congregations, the United Lutheran Mission Association, and the Evangelical Lutheran Conference &amp; Ministerium of North America (all of North America).

In the Nordic countries, members of the Communion of Nordic Lutheran Dioceses are a part of the International Lutheran Council: these include the Evangelical Lutheran Mission Diocese of Finland, the Mission Province of the Church of Sweden, and the Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of Norway. These dioceses entered into schism with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, Church of Sweden, and Church of Norway, respectively, due to &quot;the secularization of the national/state churches in their respective countries involving matters of both Christian doctrine and ethics&quot;. Apostolic succession of the Mission Province is derived from Walter Obare Omwanza, the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Kenya, who, assisted by bishops Leonid Zviki from Belarus, David Tswaedi from South Africa, and Børre Knudsen and Ulf Asp from Norway, consecrated Arne Olsson as bishop of the diocese. The Concordia Lutheran Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Sweden are other bodies that identify as Confessional Lutherans in the region of Scandinavia.

The Lutheran Church - International, which has an Evangelical Catholic churchmanship, describes itself as adhering to Confessional Lutheranism as it holds that it &quot;preaches, teaches, and confesses the Gospel of Jesus Christ as faithfully witnessed by the Augsburg Confession of 1530 and the Book of Concord.&quot;

Additionally, the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations (AFLC) describes themselves as confessional. The autonomous congregations within the AFLC are only required to officially subscribe to the unaltered Augsburg Confession and Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism, but many member congregations officially subscribe to more, or all, of the Book of Concord, while others do so unofficially in matters of doctrine and practice. All internally trained AFLC pastors are taught a &quot;quia&quot; subscription of the Book of Concord, leaving the denomination as a whole &quot;unofficially&quot; confessional in matters of preaching and teaching.

Though there are some congregations in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America which would call themselves &quot;confessional&quot;, many of those congregations have decided to leave the ELCA due to the liberal leanings of the denomination, most notably their stances expressed in the 2009 ELCA convention. The ELCA as a whole does not use the title &quot;confessional&quot; to describe itself, but it and the other member churches of the Lutheran World Federation do ascribe to the unaltered Augsburg Confession and the other confessional documents in the &quot;Book of Concord&quot; as true interpretations of the Christian faith. Additionally, the Evangelical Church of the Lutheran Confession in Brazil uses the title &quot;confessional&quot; on its name, but it instead has a &quot;&quot;Quatenus&quot; subscription to the Book of Concord and it is a member of the Lutheran World Federation.

==&quot;Quia&quot; versus &quot;Quatenus&quot; subscription==
Lutheran church bodies and Lutheran individuals that identify themselves as confessional generally hold to a &quot;quia&quot;&quot; (Latin for &quot;because&quot;) rather than a &quot;quatenus&quot; (Latin for &quot;insofar as&quot;) subscription to the &quot;Book of Concord,&quot; which contains the Apostles&#x27; Creed, Nicene Creed, Athanasian Creed, Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism, Luther&#x27;s Large Catechism, the Augsburg Confession, the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, the Smalcald Articles, the Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope, and the Formula of Concord.

&quot;Quia&quot; subscription (the &quot;Book of Concord&quot; is adhered to &quot;because&quot; it is faithful to the Scriptures) implies that the subscriber believes that there is no contradiction between the &quot;Book of Concord&quot; and the Scriptures. &quot;Quatenus&quot; subscription (the &quot;Book of Concord&quot; is adhered to &quot;insofar as&quot; it is faithful to the Scriptures) implies that the subscriber leaves room for the possibility that there might be a contradiction of the Scriptures in the &quot;Book of Concord&quot; in which case the subscriber may hold to the Scriptures against the &quot;Book of Concord&quot;. Some Confessional Lutherans maintain that this distinguishes them from other (&quot;mainline&quot;) Lutheran bodies and Lutherans, who, they believe, hold to a &quot;quatenus&quot; subscription.

C. F. W. Walther explained the meaning of confessional subscription: An unconditional subscription is the solemn declaration which the individual who wants to serve the church makes under oath (1) that he accepts the doctrinal content of our Lutheran Confessions, because he recognizes the fact that they are in full agreement with Scripture and do not militate against Scripture in any point, whether the point be of major or minor importance; and (2) that he therefore heartily believes in this divine truth and is determined to preach this doctrine.

==Views on the Antichrist==
Confessional Lutherans, including the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod, and the Church of the Lutheran Confession officially maintain that the Early apostolic Church had been led into the Great Apostasy by the Roman Catholic Church and that the Pope is the Antichrist; the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod affirms that &quot;Antichrist&quot; refers to the office, and not to the person, while the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod states that the reference is to the office, but not to the exclusion of the current office holder:

<text>A Bellman equation, named after Richard E. Bellman, is a necessary condition for optimality associated with the mathematical optimization method known as dynamic programming. It writes the &quot;value&quot; of a decision problem at a certain point in time in terms of the payoff from some initial choices and the &quot;value&quot; of the remaining decision problem that results from those initial choices. This breaks a dynamic optimization problem into a sequence of simpler subproblems, as Bellman&#x27;s “principle of optimality&quot; prescribes. The equation applies to algebraic structures with a total ordering; for algebraic structures with a partial ordering, the generic Bellman&#x27;s equation can be used.

The Bellman equation was first applied to engineering control theory and to other topics in applied mathematics, and subsequently became an important tool in economic theory; though the basic concepts of dynamic programming are prefigured in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Games and Economic Behavior&quot; and Abraham Wald&#x27;s &quot;sequential analysis&quot;. The term &quot;Bellman equation&quot; usually refers to the dynamic programming equation (DPE) associated with discrete-time optimization problems. In continuous-time optimization problems, the analogous equation is a partial differential equation that is called the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation.

In discrete time any multi-stage optimization problem can be solved by analyzing the appropriate Bellman equation. The appropriate Bellman equation can be found by introducing new state variables (state augmentation). However, the resulting augmented-state multi-stage optimization problem has a higher dimensional state space than the original multi-stage optimization problem - an issue that can potentially render the augmented problem intractable due to the “curse of dimensionality”. Alternatively, it has been shown that if the cost function of the multi-stage optimization problem satisfies a &quot;backward separable&quot; structure, then the appropriate Bellman equation can be found without state augmentation.

== Analytical concepts in dynamic programming ==
To understand the Bellman equation, several underlying concepts must be understood. First, any optimization problem has some objective: minimizing travel time, minimizing cost, maximizing profits, maximizing utility, etc. The mathematical function that describes this objective is called the &quot;objective function&quot;.

Dynamic programming breaks a multi-period planning problem into simpler steps at different points in time. Therefore, it requires keeping track of how the decision situation is evolving over time. The information about the current situation that is needed to make a correct decision is called the &quot;state&quot;. For example, to decide how much to consume and spend at each point in time, people would need to know (among other things) their initial wealth. Therefore, wealth formula_1 would be one of their &quot;state variables&quot;, but there would probably be others.

The variables chosen at any given point in time are often called the &quot;control variables&quot;. For instance, given their current wealth, people might decide how much to consume now. Choosing the control variables now may be equivalent to choosing the next state; more generally, the next state is affected by other factors in addition to the current control. For example, in the simplest case, today&#x27;s wealth (the state) and consumption (the control) might exactly determine tomorrow&#x27;s wealth (the new state), though typically other factors will affect tomorrow&#x27;s wealth too.

The dynamic programming approach describes the optimal plan by finding a rule that tells what the controls should be, given any possible value of the state. For example, if consumption (&quot;c&quot;) depends &quot;only&quot; on wealth (&quot;W&quot;), we would seek a rule formula_2 that gives consumption as a function of wealth. Such a rule, determining the controls as a function of the states, is called a &quot;policy function&quot;.

Finally, by definition, the optimal decision rule is the one that achieves the best possible value of the objective. For example, if someone chooses consumption, given wealth, in order to maximize happiness (assuming happiness &quot;H&quot; can be represented by a mathematical function, such as a utility function and is something defined by wealth), then each level of wealth will be associated with some highest possible level of happiness, formula_3. The best possible value of the objective, written as a function of the state, is called the &quot;value function&quot;.

Bellman showed that a dynamic optimization problem in discrete time can be stated in a recursive, step-by-step form known as backward induction by writing down the relationship between the value function in one period and the value function in the next period. The relationship between these two value functions is called the &quot;Bellman equation&quot;. In this approach, the optimal policy in the last time period is specified in advance as a function of the state variable&#x27;s value at that time, and the resulting optimal value of the objective function is thus expressed in terms of that value of the state variable. Next, the next-to-last period&#x27;s optimization involves maximizing the sum of that period&#x27;s period-specific objective function and the optimal value of the future objective function, giving that period&#x27;s optimal policy contingent upon the value of the state variable as of the next-to-last period decision. This logic continues recursively back in time, until the first period decision rule is derived, as a function of the initial state variable value, by optimizing the sum of the first-period-specific objective function and the value of the second period&#x27;s value function, which gives the value for all the future periods. Thus, each period&#x27;s decision is made by explicitly acknowledging that all future decisions will be optimally made.

== Derivation ==

=== A dynamic decision problem ===
Let formula_4 be the state at time formula_5. For a decision that begins at time 0, we take as given the initial state formula_6. At any time, the set of possible actions depends on the current state; we express this as formula_7, where a particular action formula_8 represents particular values for one or more control variables, and formula_9 is the set of actions available to be taken at state formula_4. It is also assumed that the state changes from formula_11 to a new state formula_12 when action formula_13 is taken, and that the current payoff from taking action formula_13 in state formula_11 is formula_16. Finally, we assume impatience, represented by a discount factor formula_17.

Under these assumptions, an infinite-horizon decision problem takes the following form:

:formula_18

subject to the constraints

:formula_19

Notice that we have defined notation formula_20 to denote the optimal value that can be obtained by maximizing this objective function subject to the assumed constraints. This function is the &quot;value function&quot;. It is a function of the initial state variable formula_6, since the best value obtainable depends on the initial situation.

=== Bellman&#x27;s principle of optimality ===
The dynamic programming method breaks this decision problem into smaller subproblems. Bellman&#x27;s &quot;principle of optimality&quot; describes how to do this:Principle of Optimality: An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision. (See Bellman, 1957, Chap. III.3.)
In computer science, a problem that can be broken apart like this is said to have optimal substructure. In the context of dynamic game theory, this principle is analogous to the concept of subgame perfect equilibrium, although what constitutes an optimal policy in this case is conditioned on the decision-maker&#x27;s opponents choosing similarly optimal policies from their points of view.

As suggested by the &quot;principle of optimality&quot;, we will consider the first decision separately, setting aside all future decisions (we will start afresh from time 1 with the new state formula_22). Collecting the future decisions in brackets on the right, the above infinite-horizon decision problem is equivalent to:

:formula_23

subject to the constraints

:formula_24

Here we are choosing formula_25, knowing that our choice will cause the time 1 state to be formula_26. That new state will then affect the decision problem from time 1 on. The whole future decision problem appears inside the square brackets on the right.

=== The Bellman equation ===
So far it seems we have only made the problem uglier by separating today&#x27;s decision from future decisions. But we can simplify by noticing that what is inside the square brackets on the right is &quot;the value&quot; of the time 1 decision problem, starting from state formula_26.

Therefore, the problem can be rewritten as a recursive definition of the value function:

:formula_28, subject to the constraints: formula_24

This is the Bellman equation. It may be simplified even further if the time subscripts are dropped and the value of the next state is plugged in:

:formula_30

The Bellman equation is classified as a functional equation, because solving it means finding the unknown function formula_31, which is the &quot;value function&quot;. Recall that the value function describes the best possible value of the objective, as a function of the state formula_11. By calculating the value function, we will also find the function formula_33 that describes the optimal action as a function of the state; this is called the &quot;policy function&quot;.

=== In a stochastic problem ===
In the deterministic setting, other techniques besides dynamic programming can be used to tackle the above optimal control problem. However, the Bellman Equation is often the most convenient method of solving &quot;stochastic&quot; optimal control problems.

For a specific example from economics, consider an infinitely-lived consumer with initial wealth endowment formula_34 at period formula_35. They have an instantaneous utility function formula_36 where formula_37 denotes consumption and discounts the next period utility at a rate of formula_38. Assume that what is not consumed in period formula_5 carries over to the next period with interest rate formula_40. Then the consumer&#x27;s utility maximization problem is to choose a consumption plan formula_41

and

:formula_42

The first constraint is the capital accumulation/law of motion specified by the problem, while the second constraint is a transversality condition that the consumer does not carry debt at the end of their life. The Bellman equation is

:formula_43

Alternatively, one can treat the sequence problem directly using, for example, the Hamiltonian equations.

Now, if the interest rate varies from period to period, the consumer is faced with a stochastic optimization problem. Let the interest &quot;r&quot; follow a Markov process with probability transition function formula_44 where formula_45 denotes the probability measure governing the distribution of interest rate next period if current interest rate is formula_40. In this model the consumer decides their current period consumption after the current period interest rate is announced.

Rather than simply choosing a single sequence formula_47, the consumer now must choose a sequence formula_47 for each possible realization of a formula_49 in such a way that their lifetime expected utility is maximized:

:formula_50

The expectation formula_51 is taken with respect to the appropriate probability measure given by &quot;Q&quot; on the sequences of &quot;r&quot;{{&#x27;}}s. Because &quot;r&quot; is governed by a Markov process, dynamic programming simplifies the problem significantly. Then the Bellman equation is simply:

:formula_52

Under some reasonable assumption, the resulting optimal policy function &quot;g&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;r&quot;) is measurable.

For a general stochastic sequential optimization problem with Markovian shocks and where the agent is faced with their decision &quot;ex-post&quot;, the Bellman equation takes a very similar form

:formula_53

== Solution methods ==
* The method of undetermined coefficients, also known as &#x27;guess and verify&#x27;, can be used to solve some infinite-horizon, autonomous Bellman equations.
* The Bellman equation can be solved by backwards induction, either analytically in a few special cases, or numerically on a computer. Numerical backwards induction is applicable to a wide variety of problems, but may be infeasible when there are many state variables, due to the curse of dimensionality. Approximate dynamic programming has been introduced by D. P. Bertsekas and J. N. Tsitsiklis with the use of artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptrons) for approximating the Bellman function. This is an effective mitigation strategy for reducing the impact of dimensionality by replacing the memorization of the complete function mapping for the whole space domain with the memorization of the sole neural network parameters. In particular, for continuous-time systems, an approximate dynamic programming approach that combines both policy iterations with neural networks was introduced. In discrete-time, an approach to solve the HJB equation combining value iterations and neural networks was introduced.
* By calculating the first-order conditions associated with the Bellman equation, and then using the envelope theorem to eliminate the derivatives of the value function, it is possible to obtain a system of difference equations or differential equations called the &#x27;Euler equations&#x27;. Standard techniques for the solution of difference or differential equations can then be used to calculate the dynamics of the state variables and the control variables of the optimization problem.

== Applications in economics ==
The first known application of a Bellman equation in economics is due to Martin Beckmann and Richard Muth. Martin Beckmann also wrote extensively on consumption theory using the Bellman equation in 1959. His work influenced Edmund S. Phelps, among others.

A celebrated economic application of a Bellman equation is Robert C. Merton&#x27;s seminal 1973 article on the intertemporal capital asset pricing model. (See also Merton&#x27;s portfolio problem). The solution to Merton&#x27;s theoretical model, one in which investors chose between income today and future income or capital gains, is a form of Bellman&#x27;s equation. Because economic applications of dynamic programming usually result in a Bellman equation that is a difference equation, economists refer to dynamic programming as a &quot;recursive method&quot; and a subfield of recursive economics is now recognized within economics.

Nancy Stokey, Robert E. Lucas, and Edward Prescott describe stochastic and nonstochastic dynamic programming in considerable detail, and develop theorems for the existence of solutions to problems meeting certain conditions. They also describe many examples of modeling theoretical problems in economics using recursive methods. This book led to dynamic programming being employed to solve a wide range of theoretical problems in economics, including optimal economic growth, resource extraction, principal–agent problems, public finance, business investment, asset pricing, factor supply, and industrial organization. Lars Ljungqvist and Thomas Sargent apply dynamic programming to study a variety of theoretical questions in monetary policy, fiscal policy, taxation, economic growth, search theory, and labor economics. Avinash Dixit and Robert Pindyck showed the value of the method for thinking about capital budgeting. Anderson adapted the technique to business valuation, including privately held businesses.

Using dynamic programming to solve concrete problems is complicated by informational difficulties, such as choosing the unobservable discount rate. There are also computational issues, the main one being the curse of dimensionality arising from the vast number of possible actions and potential state variables that must be considered before an optimal strategy can be selected. For an extensive discussion of computational issues, see Miranda and Fackler, and Meyn 2007.

== Example ==
In Markov decision processes, a Bellman equation is a recursion for expected rewards. For example, the expected reward for being in a particular state &quot;s&quot; and following some fixed policy formula_54 has the Bellman equation:

:formula_55

This equation describes the expected reward for taking the action prescribed by some policy formula_54.

The equation for the optimal policy is referred to as the &quot;Bellman optimality equation&quot;:

:formula_57

where formula_58 is the optimal policy and formula_59 refers to the value function of the optimal policy. The equation above describes the reward for taking the action giving the highest expected return.

<text>The Elizabeth Resolutes were a 19th-century professional baseball team based in Elizabeth, New Jersey. They were a member of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players for the 1873 season, and played their home games at Waverly Fairgrounds. Though based in the vicinity of Elizabeth, they were usually listed in game reports as simply &quot;Resolute&quot; or &quot;the Resolutes&quot;, per the style of the day. &quot;Elizabeth Resolutes&quot; is modern nomenclature.

The Resolutes were an amateur team dating back to the mid-1860s, and became one of a number of teams to try their hand at professional ball. The club played just 23 games during its lone professional season, finishing with two victories against 21 defeats, and losing all eight of their home games. Hugh Campbell was the pitcher of record for both wins and 16 of the losses. The Resolutes&#x27; leading hitter was Art Allison, who batted .323, his best season, while playing all 23 games, mostly in the outfield.

Although Philadelphia and New York City teams occasionally played games in New Jersey to circumvent blue laws that forbade professional baseball on Sundays, the Resolutes and the 1915 Newark Peppers of the Federal League are the only &quot;major league&quot; teams to be based in New Jersey.

<doc id="1236467" wikidata="Q3275315" url="?curid=1236467" title="Colorado Air and Space Port">
<text>Colorado Air and Space Port , formerly known as Front Range Airport, is a public airport located in unincorporated Adams County, Colorado, in the United States, adjacent to Aurora and southeast of Denver International Airport . Colorado Air and Space Port serves the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area. The postal designation of Watkins, a nearby unincorporated community, is used in the airport&#x27;s mailing address.

Colorado Air and Space Port ICAO/FAA identifiers are KCFO/CFO. The airport has no IATA designation.

Colorado Air and Space Port is a small general aviation airport, although increased demand has warranted several expansion programs in recent years. Currently, the airport serves as the base of a few flying schools, flight clubs, maintenance services, and air rescue training facilities. Due to its location on the flat plains of eastern Colorado, as well as generally cheaper aircraft rental rates, it is a very popular airport for both flight training and recreational flights. It is also popular among owners and pilots of kit-built aircraft, and the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) has a very strong presence at Colorado Air and Space Port, which frequently hosts the EAA Young Eagles Rallies.

In 2011, the State of Colorado applied to the FAA to certify Colorado Air and Space Port as a spaceport. The application was approved on August 17, 2018, and announced on August 20, 2018.

== History ==

Front Range Airport opened in 1984 when the now demolished Stapleton International Airport was the major air hub for the Denver metropolitan area. Until 2005, it was a non-towered airport without air traffic control (ATC) services when the tallest general aviation control tower in the United States (191 ft) was opened along with full ATC services. After 19 years as airport director, Dennis Heap and the airport board parted ways in August 2013. Heap was replaced in the late spring of 2014 by Dave Ruppel. The airport was originally owned by the Front Range Airport Authority (FRAA), continuing until January 1, 2014, when the FRAA was dissolved and the airport and all employees were folded into Adams County government as a department. Since then, the airport has seen a marked improvement in general aviation, air-taxi, military traffic as well as other air-based businesses, such as the helicopter-based businesses of Air Methods.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Colorado Air and Space Port covers an area of which contains two asphalt paved runways, 8/26 is 8,002 ft x 100 ft (2,439 x 30 m) and 17/35, measuring .

For the 12-month ending December 31, 2019, the airport had 75,647 aircraft operations, an average of 207 per day: 98.5% general aviation, &lt;1% air taxi and 1.4% military. There was at the time 292 aircraft based at this airport: 247 single-engine, 38 multi-engine, 4 helicopters, 1 ultralight, and 2 jet aircraft.

The airport also hosts an armory belonging to the Colorado Army National Guard. HHC, 5th Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group is based there. There are no military aircraft based at the airport.

==Spaceport proposal==
In October 2011, the governor of Colorado, John Hickenlooper, formally requested that the federal government designate Colorado a &quot;spaceport state&quot; and that the airport be designated a spaceport for suborbital horizontal takeoff flights (HTVL and HTHL). 
Spaceport designation would allow a facility offering suborbital tourism, travel, and cargo transport from one point to another on Earth. &quot;The Denver Post&quot; reported that &quot;No vertical launches are planned at the Front Range, unlike most of the other eight certified U.S. spaceports. Instead, space planes — an emerging technology — will use regular runways and jet engines to take off and land, switching to rocket power above 50,000 feet.&quot;

Media sources in 2012 suggested that the Sierra Nevada Dream Chaser spaceplane might be used for suborbital spaceflights and that Colorado Air and Space Port might prove to be the preferred location, over Spaceport America in New Mexico.
News reports indicated that the Colorado Air and Space Port proposal was gaining traction with political interests at the state and federal levels as well as with industry participants. 
One of those commercial interests was XCOR Aerospace, which was considering Spaceport Colorado as a candidate for HTHL operations with their Lynx rocketplane.
However, XCOR announced in July 2012 that they would be moving their company headquarters and research and development activities to Texas, in part due to a significant set of financial incentives () offered to XCOR by the Midland Development Corporation (MDC) and the Midland City Council.

, Colorado state law &quot;grants limited liability to spaceflight companies, allowing spaceflight participants who sign waiver forms to sue only if they are injured or killed as a result of a firm’s &#x27;willful or wanton disregard&#x27; for safety.&quot;

Spanish architect Luis Vidal produced an architectural concept for the new airport in 2013.

In December 2017, British aerospace company Reaction Engines began construction of a test facility at Colorado Air and Space Port for the development of its SABRE air-breathing rocket engine.

The spaceport designation was approved in 2018.

In December 2020, Japanese aerospace company PD AeroSpace signed an agreement with the Air and Space Port that paves the way toward test flights of high-altitude planes above the plains east of Aurora.

In October 2022 plans for Port Colorado, an industrial mixed-use development spanning 6,500 acres adjacent to Colorado Air and Space Port, were reported.

<doc id="1236470" wikidata="Q5457755" url="?curid=1236470" title="Flat Hat Club">
<text>The Flat Hat Club is the popular name of a collegiate secret society and honor fraternity founded in 1750 at the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. 

The fraternity, formally named the F.H.C. Society, was founded at the College on November 11, 1750. The society maintains relationships with societies at the University of St. Andrews and Amherst College.

The F.H.C. Society is the first recorded collegiate secret society in the United States. Early in the 21st century, the Education section of &quot;The New York Times&quot; profiled America&#x27;s oldest university clubs and societies and included a letter, now housed in the archives at Swem Library, which Thomas Jefferson wrote to Thomas McAuley, mentioning Jefferson&#x27;s membership in the F.H.C.

==History ==

=== Original society ===
The initials of the F.H.C. Society stand for a secret Latin phrase, likely &quot;Fraternitas, Humanitas, et Cognitio&quot; or &quot;Fraternitas Humanitas Cognitioque&quot; (two renderings of &quot;brotherhood, humanity, and knowledge&quot;). The &quot;brothers&quot; of the original F.H.C. devised and employed a secret handshake, wore a silver membership medal, issued certificates of membership, and met regularly for discussion and fellowship, especially at the Raleigh Tavern. The group became publicly known by the backronym &quot;Flat Hat Club&quot; in probable allusion to the mortarboard caps then commonly worn by all students at the College (now worn at graduation by students at most American universities).

William &amp; Mary alumnus and third American president Thomas Jefferson may be the most famous member of the Flat Hat Club. Other notable members of the original group included Colonel James Innes, St. George Tucker, and George Wythe. Late in life, Jefferson wrote that, &quot;[w]hen I was a student of Wm. &amp; Mary College of this state, there existed a society called the F.H.C. society, confined to the number of six students only, of which I was a member. Still, it had no useful object, nor do I know whether it now exists.&quot;

A second Latin-letter fraternity, the P.D.A. Society (publicly known as &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Ask&quot;), was founded at William and Mary in March 1773, in imitation of the F.H.C. Society. John Heath, a student at William and Mary who in 1776 sought but was refused admission to the P.D.A., later established the first Greek-letter fraternity, the Phi Beta Kappa Society.

The student members of the F.H.C. suspended the group&#x27;s activities in 1781, probably due to the suspension of academic exercises at the university as the contending armies of the American Revolution approached Williamsburg during the Yorktown campaign.

&quot;The memory of this fraternity had entirely died out at William and Mary, but [after 1909, there was a] discovery of certain manuscript material in the correspondence of St. George Tucker, who was a student of the College in 1772. ... These manuscripts consist of (1) a letter of Mr. Jefferson, written to John D. Taylor, of Maryland, giving some account of the club at the College, stating that he was a member ... [;] (2) a list of the books described as compiled for the club&#x27;s library, in 1772, by Rev. Thomas Gwatkin, Professor of Mathematics; (3) the credentials of Robert Baylor as a member in abbreviated Latin.&quot; Therefore, we know the society existed for some years and possessed a small library.

=== Subsequent society ===
The name of the group was revived in the twentieth century by application to a select group of twelve undergraduate men and four professors which had been founded in 1916 as the Spotswood Club (it thus differed markedly from the original society, a fraternity of six undergraduate men with alumnus members &quot;in urbe&quot; – that is, &quot;in town&quot;, having graduated from the university). This society operated largely as a collegiate honorary society. It suspended its activities in 1943 as the number of men enrolled at the College steeply declined because of American involvement in World War II.

The modern F.H.C. Society was revived in May 1972. It remains an all-male society, consisting of twelve undergraduate men and alumni &quot;in urbe&quot;. In recent years, an additional six members were added. Most of its activities remain comparatively secret within the university. Members receive medals of distinction upon graduation from William and Mary, showing their membership. Contrary to the practice of some similar societies, alumni may disclose their membership after graduation.

<doc id="1236472" wikidata="Q427254" url="?curid=1236472" title="Chlorite group">
<text>The chlorites are the group of phyllosilicate minerals common in low-grade metamorphic rocks and in altered igneous rocks. Greenschist, formed by metamorphism of basalt or other low-silica volcanic rock, typically contains significant amounts of chlorite.

Chlorite minerals show a wide variety of compositions, in which magnesium, iron, aluminium, and silicon substitute for each other in the crystal structure. A complete solid solution series exists between the two most common end members, magnesium-rich clinochlore and iron-rich chamosite. In addition, manganese, zinc, lithium, and calcium species are known. The great range in composition results in considerable variation in physical, optical, and X-ray properties. Similarly, the range of chemical composition allows chlorite group minerals to exist over a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. For this reason chlorite minerals are ubiquitous minerals within low and medium temperature metamorphic rocks, some igneous rocks, hydrothermal rocks and deeply buried sediments.

The name &quot;chlorite&quot; is from the Greek &quot;chloros&quot; (χλωρός), meaning &quot;green&quot;, in reference to its color. Chlorite minerals do not contain the element chlorine, also named from the same Greek root.

==Properties==
Chlorite forms blue-green crystals resembling mica. However, while the plates are flexible, they are not elastic like mica, and are less easily pulled apart. Talc is much softer and feels soapy between the fingers.

The typical general formula for chlorite is . This formula emphasizes the structure of the group, which is described as &quot;TOT-O&quot; and consists of alternating &quot;TOT&quot; layers and &quot;O&quot; layers. The &quot;TOT&quot; layer (Tetrahedral-Octahedral-Tetrahedral = T-O-T) is often referred to as a talc layer, since talc is composed entirely of stacked &quot;TOT&quot; layers. The &quot;TOT&quot; layers of talc are electrically neutral and are bound only by relatively weak van der Waals forces. By contrast, the &quot;TOT&quot; layers of chlorite contain some aluminium in place of silicon, which gives the layers an overall negative charge. These &quot;TOT&quot; layers are bound together by positively charged &quot;O&quot; layers, sometimes called brucite layers. Mica is also composed of aluminium-rich, negatively charged &quot;TOT&quot; layers, but these are bonded together by individual cations (such as potassium, sodium, or calcium ions) rather than a positively charged brucite layer.
Chlorite is considered a clay mineral. It is a nonswelling clay mineral, since water is not adsorbed in the interlayer spaces, and it has a relatively low cation exchange capacity.

==Occurrence==

Chlorite is a common mineral, found in metamorphic, igneous, and sedimentary rocks. It is an important rock-forming mineral in low- to medium-grade metamorphic rock formed by metamorphism of mafic or pelitic rock. It is also common in igneous rocks, usually as a secondary mineral, formed by alteration of mafic minerals such as biotite, hornblende, pyroxene, or garnet. The glassy rims of pillow basalt on the ocean floor is often altered to pure chlorite, in part by exchange of chemicals with seawater. The green color of many igneous rocks, slates, and schists is due to fine particles of chlorite disseminated throughout the rock. Chlorite is a common weathering product and is widespread in clay and in sedimentary rock containing clay minerals. Chlorite is found in pelites along with quartz, albite, sericite, and garnet, and is also found in associate with actinolite and epidote. 

In his pioneering work on metamorphic facies in the Scottish Highlands, G.M. Barrow identified the chlorite zone as the zone of mildest metamorphism. In modern petrology, chlorite is the diagnostic mineral of the greenschist facies. This facies is characterized by temperatures near and pressures near 5 kbar. At higher temperatures, much of the chlorite is destroyed by reactions with either potassium feldspar or phengite mica which produce biotite, muscovite, and quartz. At still higher temperatures, other reactions destroy the remaining chlorite, often with release of water vapor.

Chlorite is one of the most common minerals produced by propylitic alteration by hydrothermal systems, where it occurs in the &quot;green rock&quot; environment with epidote, actinolite, albite, hematite, and calcite.
Experiments indicate that chlorite can be stable in peridotite of the Earth&#x27;s mantle above the ocean lithosphere carried down by subduction, and chlorite may even be present in the mantle volume from which island arc magmas are generated.

== Members of the chlorite group ==

Clinochlore, pennantite, and chamosite are the most common varieties. Several other sub-varieties have been described. A massive compact variety of clinochlore used as a decorative carving stone is referred to by the trade name seraphinite. It occurs in the Korshunovskoye iron skarn deposit in the Irkutsk Oblast of Eastern Siberia.

== Uses ==
Chlorite does not have any specific industrial uses of any importance. Some rock types containing chlorite, such as chlorite schist, have minor decorative uses or as construction stone. However, chlorite is a common mineral in clay, which has a vast number of uses.

Chlorite schist has been used as roofing granules, the mineral granules adhered to asphalt composition shingles due to the green color. It was quarried near Ely, Minnesota, US, until superseded by synthetic materials.

<doc id="1236474" wikidata="Q7488885" url="?curid=1236474" title="Shannon Hale">
<text>Shannon Hale (née Shannon Bryner; born January 26, 1974) is an American author primarily of young adult fantasy, including the Newbery Honor book &quot;Princess Academy&quot; and &quot;The Goose Girl&quot;. Her first novel for adults, &quot;Austenland&quot;, was adapted into a film in 2013. She is a graduate of the University of Utah and the University of Montana. She has also co-written with her husband, Dean.

==Early life==
Hale was born on January 26, 1974, in Salt Lake City to Wallace and Bonnie Bryner. She is the middle child of five children; she has two older sisters, one younger sister, and one younger brother. She enjoyed writing, reading, and acting as a young girl; she often created plays that she would act out with friends. She also began to write fantasy books at age 10, often featuring herself as the protagonist. Her elementary school teachers encouraged her creative endeavors, and, in the fourth grade, Hale announced that she wanted to be a writer as an adult. In junior high, she participated on the school literary magazine. She then attended West High School, where she cultivated passions for English and drama. She took a creative writing class and worked as an editor of fiction for her high school&#x27;s literary magazine. She participated in both school and community theater productions, including &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. Hale also took part in drama competitions and traveled throughout Utah and the U.S. with an improvisational theater group whose productions highlighted a range of teen issues. She met her spouse, Dean Hale, freshman year at West High School; he was also involved in theater. Hale has said that her theater experience has improved her writing skills, particularly in character creation and world building.

She attended the University of Utah, initially majoring in both English and Theater before deciding solely to pursue the former. She served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Paraguay for 18 months before graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from the University of Utah in 1998. She later earned a master&#x27;s degree in Creative Writing from the University of Montana. While studying at the University of Montana, Hale wrote 100 short stories and submitted many for publication, but none were accepted.

==Writing==
Hale began writing &quot;The Goose Girl&quot; while in her graduate writing program, and worked on her drafts of it during her lunch break while working at her instructional design job. She originally planned to work in literary fiction, publishing short stories and teaching English, before writing young adult and children&#x27;s books. &quot;The Goose Girl&quot; became her first published novel after being met with nine rejections; Hale received an offer in 2003 from Bloomsbury Publishing. She based the book on her favorite fairy tale of the same name. It was named an ALA Teens&#x27; Top Ten and became the first of many novels in Hale&#x27;s Books of Bayern series. &quot;The Goose Girl&quot; also won the 2004 Josette Frank Award for fiction and was reprinted by Bloomsbury in 2017. Hundreds of thousands of copies of the novel have been printed in a total of fifteen languages. The other Books of Bayern include &quot;Enna Burning&quot;, &quot;River Secrets&quot;, and &quot;Forest Born&quot;.

Her novel &quot;Princess Academy&quot; was featured on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, as well as that of &quot;Book Sense&quot; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. It also received a Newbery Honor. Hale said that receiving the award was an &quot;unexpected gift&quot; that has profoundly affected her career. After the positive response from readers and reviewers alike to &quot;Princess Academy&quot;, Hale wrote its sequel, &quot;Princess Academy: Palace of Stone&quot;. In 2015 she continued the story with a third installment, &quot;Princess Academy: The Forgotten Sisters&quot;. Hale has remarked that the series is &quot;a love letter to education.&quot;

Her first adult novel, &quot;Austenland&quot;, was also featured by &quot;Book Sense&quot;. Hale and screenwriter Jerusha Hess then wrote the screenplay for a film adaptation of &quot;Austenland&quot;, released in 2013 at the Sundance Film Festival. It was then bought by Sony Pictures for $4 million. &quot;Twilight&quot; author Stephenie Meyer produced the film and Keri Russell starred as protagonist Jane Hayes. In 2012 Hale released a sequel novel, &quot;Midnight in Austenland&quot;. Another adult novel, &quot;The Actor and the Housewife&quot;, was published in 2009 and was named &quot;the &quot;City Weekly&quot; readers&#x27; choice winner for best novel of the year.&quot; Hale has kept numerous rejection letters she has received from publishers, and has compiled them into one 60 foot long scroll.

In 2017, Hale released a graphic memoir titled &quot;Real Friends&quot;, chronicling her struggles in grade school. It was illustrated by LeUyen Pham. Its sequel, &quot;Best Friends&quot;, appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for graphic books and manga in April 2020. In 2018, her &quot;Princess in Black&quot; series—which she wrote with her husband, Dean Hale—made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for children&#x27;s series. The two also co-wrote the graphic novel &quot;Rapunzel&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, as well as two young adult novels for the Marvel superheroes Squirrel Girl and Captain Marvel. Hale ventured further into science fiction with her own YA superhero novel, &quot;Dangerous&quot;, in 2014.

== Other work ==
Before becoming a full-time author, Hale participated in stage and improvisational comedy, studied in Mexico and the United Kingdom, and worked as an instructional designer.

She is an advocate for gender equality; she has noticed how her books are marketed only to girls, despite positive reception from both genders. She has written a few articles about this subject.

==Personal life==
Hale is married to Dean C. Hale, with whom she has co-authored the Eisner-nominee graphic novels &quot;Rapunzel&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Calamity Jack&quot;, as well as &quot;The Princess in Black&quot; series and &quot;The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl&quot; series.

She is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). She stopped attending the LDS church in 2021, having disagreed with her community&#x27;s apparent tolerance of misogyny and intolerance of LGBTQ people, but she still considers herself a Mormon. In a 2014 interview, Hale said that she doesn&#x27;t &quot;consciously make storytelling choices based on the [LDS] Church.&quot; In writing her graphic novel memoirs of her childhood, Hale decided to include visual references to her religious upbringing, like her family attending church. Despite being asked to remove the references (due to worries that it might affect sales), Hale decided to retain them, stating that &quot;to erase [them] felt like a lie.&quot;

She is the mother of four children: Max, Magnolia, and twin girls Dinah and Wren. Hale has noted that her children give her new ideas for books &quot;probably every day.&quot;

== Awards and honors ==
&quot;The Princess in Black&quot; was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, and &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; named it one of the best books of 2014.

In February 2016, Hale was a Literary Guest of Honor and Keynote Speaker at the 34th annual Life, the Universe, &amp; Everything professional science fiction and fantasy arts symposium.

In 2017, &quot;Real Friends&quot; landed on &quot;Booklist&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Graphic Novels for Youth&quot; list.

&quot;Itty-Bitty Kitty-Corn&quot; was a &quot;New York Times&quot; and IndieBound bestseller.

<doc id="1236476" wikidata="Q2456755" url="?curid=1236476" title="Truxtun-class destroyer">
<text>Three &quot;Truxtun&quot;-class destroyers were built for the United States Navy. Part of the original 16 destroyers authorized by Congress on 4 May 1898 for the fiscal year 1899 program, they were commissioned in 1902. They were very similar to their contemporaries, except for mounting six 6-pounder (57 mm) guns instead of five. They were considered the most successful of the first 16 US Navy destroyers, and were succeeded by the larger .

The &quot;Truxtun&quot;s escorted convoys during World War I. All were decommissioned in 1919 and converted to merchant vessels in 1920.

==Design==

===Armament===

The as-built torpedo armament was two torpedo tubes with four torpedoes. The gun armament was two /50 caliber guns and six 6-pounder () guns.

During World War I the class was equipped with one or two depth charge racks for the convoy escort mission. Also during World War I, the single torpedo tubes were replaced with two twin torpedo tubes on &quot;Truxton&quot; and &quot;Worden&quot;, with the number of torpedoes remaining at four. &quot;Whipple&quot; was modified with one twin torpedo tube mount and four torpedoes at this time.

===Engineering===
&quot;Truxtun&quot; had four Thornycroft boilers supplying steam to two vertical triple-expansion engines totaling (design). She made on trials at . Normal coal capacity was 232 tons.

==Service==
&quot;Truxtun&quot; and &quot;Whipple&quot; served first on the East Coast and later on the West Coast prior to World War I. &quot;Worden&quot; engaged in reserve training duties on the East Coast and acted as a submarine tender 1914–17. All three served in the Atlantic during the US participation in World War I. Following the Armistice, all were sold in 1920 for scrapping but then converted for merchant use.

===Merchant Service===
On 3 Jan 1920, the three were sold for pennies per pound to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company for scrapping. Instead, Hitner decided to sell them for motor fruit carriers; It made sense as the vessels were shallow enough to maneuver through the narrow fruit company waterways such as the Snyder Canal in Panama, and, with their engineering suite reduced and armament removed, were still fast and economical enough to get the job done. With their old magazines and one of their boiler rooms turned into banana holds, they could hold as many as 15,000 stems of fruit.

The ships were rebuilt, scrapping their old VTE suites and boilers for a pair of economical 12-cylinder Atlas Imperial Diesels—a company known for outfitting tugs and trawlers—generating 211 NHP and allowing a sustained speed of 15 knots. This removed all four of their coal funnels, replacing them with a number of tall cowl vents and a single diesel stack aft. So reconstructed, their weight was listed as 433 GRT with a 264-foot length and 14-foot depth of hold. The crew was reduced to an officer and 17 hands. Painted buff above the waterline to help reflect heat, they still had their greyhound lines. They served in the &quot;Banana Boom&quot; of the 1920s. The sisters were registered in 1921 by Robert Shepherd in Nicaragua and soon used on the banana runs to Galveston and New Orleans, flying the flag of the Snyder Banana Company of Bluefields.

In 1922, the boats had been impounded by R.A. Harvin, the United States Marshal in Texas, after a libel proceeding, and sold at public auction to one Harry Nevelson, who in turn quickly resold them to the Mexican-American Fruit Company, and sometime shortly after they were sailing for the Southern Banana Co.

By 1925, the trio was all part of the Vaccaro brothers’ upstart New Orleans–based Standard Fruit &amp; S S Co (now part of Dole).

By 1933, Lloyds listed &quot;Worden&quot; as owned by the American Fruit &amp; S S Corp—later adjusted to “Seaboard S S Corp (Standard Fruit, Mgrs)” in subsequent listings—out of Bluefields, Nicaragua with a tonnage of 546 GRT. By 1939 &quot;Worden&quot; was listed as owned by the Bahamas Shipping Company and with tonnage adjusted to 433 GRT.

===World War II===
The Bahamas Shipping Company tried to make &quot;Worden&quot; as neutral as possible. However, on 1 May 1942 she had a run-in with &quot;La Paz&quot;, just damaged by &quot;U-109&quot;. &quot;Worden&quot; took the damaged ship in tow, after sending a message out reporting the torpedoing. Hereupon many authors seize and claim that &quot;U-109&quot; bagged both &quot;La Paz&quot; and the former destroyer. However, both ships survived, &quot;La Paz&quot; by being beached, and &quot;Worden&quot;, undamaged, remained in Lloyd&#x27;s register. One source says that she was subsequently lost on 1 May 1947, but another record has her as scrapped in 1956.

Her sister &quot;Truxtun&quot; was lost on 5 September 1938 and &quot;Whipple&quot; were scrapped in 1956.

==Ships in class==
Note that, although the ships are listed below with the prefix &quot;DD-&quot; before their official numbers, this classification was not created until 1911, and until then these vessels were officially categorised as &quot;Destroyer No. 14&quot; to &quot;Destroyer No. 16&quot;.

<text>Elias Kent Kane (June 7, 1794December 12, 1835) was the first Illinois Secretary of State and a U.S. Senator from Illinois.

==Early life==

He was born in New York City, to merchant Capt. Elias Kent Kane and Deborah VanSchelluyne of Dutchess County, New York. Young Kane attended public schools, then Yale College, from which he has graduated in the year 1813.

==Career==
After he studied law and was admitted to the bar, Kane commenced practice in Nashville, Tennessee, and then moved to Kaskaskia, Illinois in 1814.

He became allied with Jesse B. Thomas, a slaveholder who had secured the job of judge of the Territory of Illinois. Like Judge Thomas and his rival Ninian Edwards, Kane was a delegate to the first state constitutional convention in 1818. At the convention, the Thomas/Kane faction unsuccessfully tried to add language permitting slavery in the new state (where it had been forbidden by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787). However, that proposal was defeated by a faction whose leaders included Baptist John Mason Peck, Methodist Peter Cartwright, Quaker James Lemen, publisher Hooper Warren and future governor Edward Coles. Kane claimed ownership of five people as slaves in 1820,

After an unsuccessful 1820 campaign for election to the 17th Congress which featured numerous letters in the &quot;Edwardsville Spectator&quot; concerning slavery, and which anti-slavery candidate Daniel Pope Cook won, Kane became Illinois&#x27; first Secretary of State, and served from 1820 to 1824. In that year, Kane led proslavery forces in the Illinois House of Representatives which attempted to call another constitutional convention, but was again defeated by a coalition led by Governor Coles, U.S. Representative Cook and religious leaders of many denominations.
However, fellow legislators twice appointed Kane to the United States Senate. He served from March 4, 1825, until his death in Washington, D.C., in 1835.

==Legacy==
His body was returned to the family farm in Randolph County, Illinois, but due to continued desecration of the family gravesite, he was reinterred in 1984 (a campaign led by local funeral director, Michael McClure) in Evergreen Cemetery in nearby Chester, in a grave adjacent with that of his sometime political opponent and Illinois&#x27; first governor, Shadrach Bond. The Kane family gravesite includes that of his wife, the former Frances Pelletier (1799-1851), two children who died young, and four sons. One son, Elias Kent Kane, Jr. (1822-1853), served in the United States Army. One of Kane&#x27;s daughters married Illinois governor William H. Bissell, a vocal opponent of slavery. Kane&#x27;s father (of the same name) is buried in Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., having survived this son by five years and secured his namesake grandson&#x27;s admission to West Point.

On January 16, 1836, the Illinois legislature formed a new county, Kane, and named it to honor the recently deceased Senator, Elias Kent Kane.

<text>WPKD-TV (channel 19), branded KDKA+, is an independent television station licensed to Jeannette, Pennsylvania, United States, serving the Pittsburgh area. It is owned by the CBS News and Stations group alongside KDKA-TV (channel 2), the market&#x27;s CBS owned-and-operated station. The two stations share studios at the Gateway Center in Downtown Pittsburgh; WPKD-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in the city&#x27;s Perry North neighborhood along with KDKA-TV. As CBS has done with most of its other duopolies in other markets, WPKD-TV&#x27;s web address has been folded within the CBS News website with only basic station and programming information, along with entertainment news and promotional video.

==History==
===As WARD-TV (1953–1970)===
WPKD-TV signed on the air on October 15, 1953, as WARD-TV on analog UHF channel 56, with studios on Franklin Street in downtown Johnstown, Pennsylvania. It operated at a power of 91,000 watts visual, and 45,500 watts aural power, which, as it was later learned in these experimental days of UHF, was rather low for a UHF station. It was co-owned by Central Broadcasting through its Rivoli Realty subsidiary along with WARD radio (1490 AM, now WNTJ, and 92.1 FM, now WJHT). The station was Johnstown&#x27;s CBS affiliate with a secondary ABC affiliation. During the late-1950s, it was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.

===As WJNL-TV (1971–1982)===
In 1972, Jonel Construction Company bought Cover Broadcasting, the parent of WARD-AM-TV, and changed their call signs to WJNL-AM-TV on August 13. Having been issued a construction permit to do so in 1969, the television station then moved to the stronger UHF channel 19 and dropped ABC programming. The channel move also brought a transmitter power increase to 215,000 watts visual and 21,500 watts aural—still very modest for a network affiliate on the UHF band.

Jonel also left the Franklin Street studio for a new facility located on Benshoff Hill, not too far from the transmitter atop Cover Hill in suburban Johnstown. The radio stations moved to the Benshoff Hill location in 1977, after the Franklin Street studios were destroyed in a massive flood.

Even with the move to the stronger channel 19 and its substantial power increase, WJNL-TV was still plagued by a weak signal. Most of Western Pennsylvania is a very rugged dissected plateau. At the time, UHF stations usually did not get good reception in rugged terrain. This left the station dependent on cable–then as now, all but essential for acceptable television in much of this market. In fact, Johnstown viewers got better signals from WFBG-TV (channel 10) in Altoona and KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh. After WFBG-TV was sold in 1973, that station changed its callsign to WTAJ-TV in part to acknowledge its Johnstown viewership (its call letters stand for &quot;We&#x27;re Television for Altoona and Johnstown&quot;). As a result, WJNL-TV never thrived, and was more or less a non-factor in a market dominated by WJAC-TV (channel 6). It only stayed afloat because of the tremendous success of its FM sister, an adult contemporary powerhouse.

In 1978, WJNL-TV dropped its affiliation with CBS and became an independent station. Forced to buy an additional 19 hours of programming a day, its ratings plummeted even further.

===As WFAT and WPTJ (1983–1991)===
Channel 19 was sold on February 1, 1983, to WFAT Incorporated—a company headed by Leon Crosby, a former owner of the original KEMO-TV in San Francisco—and renamed WFAT-TV on March 14. That same day, it extended its broadcast day. Acting on approvals granted the year prior by local and federal authorities, the station&#x27;s transmitter facility was moved from Cover Hill to Pea Vine Hill, a much higher summit atop Laurel Hill Mountain in Ligonier Township, just over the Somerset County line in neighboring Westmoreland County, about east of the Cover Hill location. With the move came another significant power increase yet to 1.6 million watts visual, and 166,000 watts aural. This enabled the station to provide a grade B signal to Pittsburgh&#x27;s eastern suburbs; indeed, the new transmitter was located within the Pittsburgh market. The new transmitter finally provided city-grade coverage to all of Johnstown, allowing many viewers who had struggled to watch the station over-the-air for 30 years to get a clear picture for the first time. It also allowed the station to introduce itself to viewers in the Pittsburgh area. However, it still had a problem attracting Altoona viewers due to the mountainous terrain separating the two cities, resulting in marginal reception at best on the eastern side of the market. Crosby addressed this by signing on a VHF translator (W12BR) in Altoona. The changes did little to improve the station&#x27;s fortunes, largely because the major Pittsburgh independents had long been available on cable.

While WFAT now had a fairly decent signal in most of the market, it had comparatively little to offer. At the time of the change, WJNL-TV had a mixture of independent and religious programs; the relaunch saw it extend its broadcast day from 8 hours to 13. It was one of the few stations, even in small markets, that still used art cards rather than CGI technology. Its character generator had been in service for over three decades, dating to when the station was WARD-TV. Its microphones were second-class. Crosby&#x27;s formula of turning weak stations around by producing local shows with young creative talent was no longer viable for WFAT-TV, as such shows were losing ground to syndicators now offering much cheaper alternatives that could be tailor-made for specific markets. The very few locally produced programs WFAT now had left were limited to discussion-based talk shows on simple, undecorated sets with little more than chairs and plywood platforms covered with low-quality carpeting. David Smith and Lee Mack (the former had been program director of WJNL radio) served as the station&#x27;s booth announcers.

===Decline and bankruptcy (1986–1990)===
WFAT&#x27;s fortunes suffered a crippling blow in 1986, when WWCP-TV (channel 8) signed on as Johnstown&#x27;s second independent station. WWCP took most of WFAT&#x27;s stronger shows due to having the advantage of a stronger VHF signal. The station changed calls to WPTJ in 1988 and moved its studios to Allen Bill Drive in the Johnstown Industrial Park, but saw no change in its fortunes. Frequent transmitter problems often left the station off-the-air for extended periods of time.

Crosby filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1988, and in January 1990, the bankruptcy court ordered its conversion to a Chapter 7 liquidation. WPTJ remained on the air for almost five months after the conversion. However, on May 1, all of the station&#x27;s staffers except assistant general manager Ron Patcher quit after not being paid for four weeks. Patcher spent the next five days keeping the station operating. However, he quit on May 6 after concluding the load of working 18-hour days was &quot;too much,&quot; and WPTJ went silent. The studio site was repossessed, and the transmitter equipment was said to be located in &quot;somebody&#x27;s basement&quot; by a broker attempting to find suitors for the failed station.

===Return as WTWB-TV (1994–1997)===

Meanwhile, over in Pittsburgh, Venture Technologies Group had signed on low-power station W29AH (channel 29) in 1989 with the Video Jukebox Network, later known as The Box. However, five years later, Venture saw opportunity. Pittsburgh was the largest market without a signed affiliate of The WB, and it snagged the affiliation for its low-power station. At the same time, Venture purchased the silent WPTJ at a bankruptcy auction for less than $1 million. Channel 29 became WTWB-LP and then WBPA-LP, while channel 19 was given the new call letters WTWB-TV and plans were announced for the two to form a simulcast.

On July 27, 1996, Venture reactivated the channel 19 facility under the WTWB-TV calls, operating from a new transmitter on Laurel Mountain west of Jennerstown. However, cable systems in Pittsburgh were not required to carry channel 19 because it was licensed to Johnstown, located in a separate media market. As a result, after claiming that Johnstown–Altoona could not support five TV stations, Venture won permission to move WTWB-TV&#x27;s city of license to Jeannette, an eastern suburb of Pittsburgh. Since WTWB-TV was now a Pittsburgh-market station, Venture could now invoke must-carry protection.

===As WNPA (1997–2006)===
By the time WTWB-TV had been approved to move to Jeannette, however, more than the city of license was changing. Sinclair Broadcast Group secured a group deal with The WB to change several of its stations to that network, including WPTT (channel 22), which became WCWB. (That station is now WPNT.) Just as cable systems in the Pittsburgh metro area began adding channel 19, it began the fall TV season as an independent under new WNPA call letters. The UPN affiliation moved to channel 19 in January.

Viacom&#x27;s Paramount Stations Group bought the station in November 1998 for $39 million, a significant return on Venture&#x27;s original investment in 1994. After taking ownership on February 1, 1999, Paramount announced that WNPA&#x27;s Monroeville facilities would close; technical operations were moved to WPSG in Philadelphia, while a new sales and marketing staff would be based out of Downtown Pittsburgh. Venture would continue to operate WNPA through March 1; plans were also announced to end the simulcast with WBPA-LP, which Venture retained. Channel 19 became a sister station to KDKA-TV after Viacom merged with CBS in 2000. That September, CBS announced that WNPA&#x27;s operations would be consolidated into the studios at One Gateway Center already occupied by KDKA-TV and KDKA radio. WNPA rebranded from &quot;UPN 19&quot; to &quot;UPN Pittsburgh&quot; in September 2004 due to the fact that various cable providers in the area carry the station on different channels.

===As WPCW (2006–2023)===

On January 24, 2006, Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that The WB and UPN would shut down and be replaced by a new network called The CW, which would initially feature series from both predecessor networks along with newer programs. To coincide with this change, the station changed its call sign to WPCW on April 3 and rebranded itself as &quot;Pittsburgh&#x27;s CW&quot; in August. The network launched on September 18, 2006.

WPCW&#x27;s analog transmitter was southeast of Jeannette. This provided city-grade coverage to Johnstown and &quot;rimshot&quot; coverage to Pittsburgh. As a result, it was barely viewable over-the-air in many low-lying areas in the northern and western parts of the city and could not be seen at all in the city&#x27;s western suburbs. When it applied to move the channel 19 license to Jeannette, Venture sought and received a waiver from the FCC rule requiring a station&#x27;s transmitter to be no farther than from the city of license. It successfully contended that there was no way it could build an analog tower within the 15-mile limit without interfering with WOIO in Cleveland. However, WPCW built its digital transmitter in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Perry North section, on some of the highest ground in the city. On June 12, 2009, coinciding with the national transition to digital television, WPCW turned off its analog transmitter near Jennerstown and began broadcasting its digital signal from its new transmitter in Pittsburgh.

The relocation of WPCW&#x27;s transmitter now provides Pittsburgh with city-grade coverage, in addition to greater coverage west of the city, but has left many viewers east of Westmoreland County (who were able to pick up WPCW&#x27;s analog signal) without a viewable signal. However, few, if any, viewers lost access to WPCW&#x27;s programming. For years, CBS has fed a direct fiber signal to both Comcast and Verizon FiOS. Additionally, WPCW signed on a translator in Johnstown to retain coverage to that area and still included Johnstown as part of its station identification. WPCW is one of three former CBS affiliates that have since become CW stations owned by CBS, along with WTVX in West Palm Beach, Florida, and KSTW in Seattle. However, WTVX was later divested to Cerberus Capital Management&#x27;s Four Points Media Group (the Four Points Media stations are now owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns Pittsburgh stations WPGH-TV and WPNT).

By way of extended cable coverage, WPCW remained available in the Johnstown–Altoona–State College television market as its default CW affiliate until September 16, 2019, when WJAC-TV converted of its fourth digital subchannel into a CW Plus affiliate.

On December 4, 2019, CBS Corporation and Viacom remerged into ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global).

===Independence as WPKD-TV (2023–present)===
On October 3, 2022, Nexstar Media Group acquired majority ownership of The CW. Under the agreement, CBS was given the right to pull its affiliations from WPCW and its seven other CW stations. On May 5, 2023, CBS announced that it would exercise that right and WPCW would cease airing the network&#x27;s programming at the end of August and become an independent station. On July 18, CBS News and Stations submitted a request to change WPCW&#x27;s call letters to WPKD-TV as of September 1. On August 24, it was announced that the station would rebrand on-air as &quot;KDKA+&quot;, serving as a brand extension of KDKA-TV.

==Programming==
===Sports programming===
Currently, WPKD-TV televises some Pittsburgh Penguins preseason games due to Pittsburgh Pirates conflicts on SportsNet Pittsburgh (the team&#x27;s usual broadcasting partner). Since 2023, WPKD has aired matches featuring Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC of the USL Championship. Since 2024, WPKD has aired a select number of games from the Cleveland Cavaliers, as well as pregame and postgame coverage for those telecasts.

WPKD airs local high school football (including playoffs and championships) from the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (branded as &quot;Steel City High School Football Showcase&quot;), college football from the Division III Presidents’ Athletic Conference, and syndicated coverage of college football and basketball from the MEAC and SWAC.

WPKD-TV and KDKA-TV serve as the area&#x27;s official Pittsburgh Steelers stations and air several team-related shows. This includes &quot;Steelers Saturday Night&quot; on Saturday nights from 9 to 10 p.m. and Steelers TV on Saturday nights from 11 to 11:30 p.m. (hosted by &quot;Steelers Digest&quot; editor Bob Labriola) during the NFL season. Depending on CBS&#x27; weekly doubleheader schedule, the &quot;Extra Point&quot; airs on WPKD-TV right after a Steelers game. That program is hosted by Bob Pompeani and Chris Hoke. &quot;The Nightly Sports Call&quot; airs every night from 10:35 to 11 p.m. after the KDKA-TV-produced prime time newscast. Weeknights are anchored by Bob Pompeani while weekends feature Rich Walsh. Depending on the doubleheader schedule, there is a special edition that is shown during the season after the &quot;Extra Point&quot;.

===Newscasts===

As WJNL-TV in Johnstown, the station produced a local newscast from 1971 to 1974 on weekdays and a few public affairs programs to try to compete against WJAC-TV. However, its facilities were below the standards expected for a network affiliate. 

As WNPA, the station began airing a twice-nightly weather forecast by Jim Madaus, chief meteorologist of Viacom-owned WKBD in Detroit, on December 20, 1999; Madaus also began providing similar segments to other Viacom stations around the same time. On August 6, 2001, WNPA began to carry a 10 p.m. newscast every night produced by KDKA-TV. The 35-minute newscast competes with a nightly newscast at 10 p.m. on Fox affiliate WPGH-TV that is produced by WPXI. 

On September 12, 2005, WNPA debuted a two-hour extension of KDKA-TV&#x27;s weekday morning newscast airing from 7 to 9 a.m. This was later shortened to one hour amid poor ratings, but the 8 a.m. hour was restored in 2019. On June 16, 2009, KDKA began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition, starting with its weekday noon broadcast, with the introduction of a new set and weather center. KDKA was the last major Pittsburgh television station to begin airing newscasts in HD and the WPCW shows were included in the upgrade.

On September 20, 2021, WPCW added a 12:30 p.m. rebroadcast of KDKA&#x27;s noon newscast. On January 8, 2024, WPKD-TV added an 8 p.m. newscast called &quot;Primetime News on KDKA+&quot;.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WPKD-TV (as WPCW) shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 19, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station moved its digital signal from its pre-transition UHF channel 49 (where its digital signal was originally slated to remain post-transition) to VHF channel 11 (the former allocation of WPXI&#x27;s analog signal). Digital television receivers display the station&#x27;s virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 19. Interference with Cleveland CBS affiliate WOIO that existed when both stations operated analog signals is no longer an issue as that station is broadcasting its digital signal on VHF channel 10. In July 2009, the station applied with the FCC for a repeater digital signal on channel 27 in Johnstown.
