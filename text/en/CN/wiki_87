<doc id="1260694" wikidata="Q1934928" url="?curid=1260694" title="About URI scheme">
<text>about is an internal URI scheme (also known as a &quot;URL scheme&quot; or, erroneously, &quot;protocol&quot;) implemented in various web browsers to reveal internal state and built-in functions. It is an IANA officially registered scheme, and is standardized.

The most commonly implemented codice_1 URIs are codice_2, which displays a blank HTML document, and simply codice_3, which may display information about the browser. Some browsers use URIs beginning with the name of the browser for similar purposes, and many codice_1 URIs will be translated into the appropriate URI if entered. Examples are codice_5 (Opera) or codice_6 (Google Chrome). An exception is codice_2, which is not translated.

In early versions of Netscape, any URI beginning with codice_3 that wasn&#x27;t recognized as a built-in command would simply result in the text after the colon being displayed. Similarly, in early versions of Internet Explorer, codice_3 followed by a string of HTML (e.g. codice_10) would render that string as though it were the source of the page — thus providing a similar (though more limited) facility to the defined by . Still other versions of Netscape would return various phrases in response to an unknown codice_1 URI, including &quot;Whatchew talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout, Willis?&quot; (a catch phrase from the TV show &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;) or &quot;Homey don&#x27;t play dat!&quot; (from a recurring skit on the TV show &quot;In Living Color&quot;).
==Standardization==
In 2010, and onwards, there are efforts to standardize the codice_1 URI scheme, and define the processing requirements for some specific URIs, in the IETF Applications Area Working Group (APPSAWG). In August 2012, it was published as an official Request for Comments as . The codice_1 URIs that have since been defined and assigned by IANA are listed below.

==Common==
==Chrome and Chromium derivatives==
The following applies to all web browsers that derive from the Chromium project, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi.
The above list is not exhaustive; for a full list, see about:about URI.

==Firefox==
Many of these can also be used in Thunderbird, by setting them as the &quot;Mail Start Page&quot;. Also, some extensions define additional about: URIs not listed here.
==Opera (v1–15)==
In Opera, codice_3 is an alias for the codice_15 scheme; therefore all these URIs also work with about prefixed. User JavaScript is disabled for all URIs in the codice_3 or codice_15 schemes as a security feature. These pages can, however, be styled using local stylesheets.

None of these functions, except the codice_18 combination, work in the Nintendo DS Browser, which is an Opera derivative.

==Internet Explorer (6–11)==
Internet Explorer about URIs are configurable in Windows. It is therefore possible that some of the listed URIs will not work on a particular computer. For example, &quot;about:mozilla&quot; was removed in SP2 (although the page can still be found at &quot;res://mshtml.dll/about.moz&quot;). These about URIs are sometimes used for spyware and adware, most notably in CoolWebSearch, which made about:blank display advertisements.

Any codice_1 URI that is not recognized by Internet Explorer redirects to a page saying &quot;Navigation to the webpage was canceled.&quot;

==Microsoft Edge Legacy (v20–44)==
The following applies to Microsoft Edge Legacy version 20 through 44. For newer Edge versions, see the Chromium section.
==GNOME Web==
When GNOME Web (formerly Epiphany) used Gecko as its layout engine, all Firefox-specific codice_3 URIs worked in it. After the adoption of WebKit as its layout engine, only the following URIs are supported.

==Netscape==
The about: URL originated in and has existed in all versions of Netscape browsers. It was originally added as an Easter egg to display information about the development team.

Older versions of the Netscape browser have an codice_21 URI that was similar to codice_22 above, but it would redirect to Netscape&#x27;s active employee listing. In addition, codice_23, where &quot;username&quot; is the username of a Netscape employee, would redirect to the Netscape homepage of the employee specified. For example, codice_24 would redirect to http://people.netscape.com/jwz/ (not an active link). Not all employee pages were accessible through this scheme. Only developers who knew which file in the source tree and the encoding scheme used to obfuscate the directory of employee about entries could add their names.

Many other codice_3 easter eggs existed, including the famous about:mozilla, and other less known ones that showed pictures of the Netscape mascot Mozilla in various foreign garb, such as &quot;about:deutsch&quot; showing Mozilla in Lederhosen.

Some versions of Netscape would display the browser history for the codice_26 URI.

==Others==
* In Konqueror, any codice_1 URI except codice_2 and codice_29 redirects to codice_30, which shows a friendly ‘start’ and navigation page.
* In Internet Explorer for Mac 5 was an offline Easter egg, accessible by typing ‘about:tasman’, showing the Acid1 test with the text replaced by the names of the developers.
* Safari only recognizes codice_2.
* Microsoft Outlook supports an additional codice_32 URI, which shows the Outlook Today Screen. This screen shows messages, tasks and appointments; it is also accessible from Internet Explorer. Outlook recognizes codice_2 too, but no other &quot;about:&quot; URIs.

<doc id="1260697" wikidata="Q601776" url="?curid=1260697" title="Antonio Davis">
<text>Antonio Lee Davis (born October 31, 1968) is an American former professional basketball player who played for the Indiana Pacers, Toronto Raptors, Chicago Bulls, and New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He also played for Panathinaikos B.C. in Greece and Philips Milano in Italy. Davis is also the former president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA). On October 31, 2012, ESPN announced the hiring of Davis as a studio analyst for NBA broadcasts. He is also currently a co-host/analyst on SiriusXM NBA Radio.

==College career==
Davis played college basketball at UTEP under coach Don Haskins from 1986 to 1990. Teaming up with fellow future NBA-All star Tim Hardaway, Davis helped the Miners win 25 games and earn the seventh seed in the 1987 NCAA tournament as they defeated the number ten seed Arizona in overtime by a score of 98–91; they would, however, lose in the second round to Iowa by a score of 84–82. The next year, Davis started 30 games and averaged nearly 10 points with 6 rebounds as the Miners won 23 games and again advanced to the tournament, only to lose to number nine seed Seton Hall by a score of 80–64. As a junior, Davis averaged 14 points (second to Hardaway) with 8 rebounds a game as the Miners won 26 games and again gained the seventh seed, in the 1989 NCAA tournament, where they defeated number 10 seed LSU by a score of 85–74, only to lose in the second round to second-seeded Indiana by a score of 92–69. In Davis&#x27; senior year, (despite the departure of Hardaway to the NBA) the Miners still won 21 games, with Davis averaging 10 points and 7 rebounds a game; they would lose to the number six seed coming out of the tournament that year, Minnesota. After four seasons at UTEP, Davis declared for the 1990 NBA draft.

==European career==
Davis was drafted by the Indiana Pacers in the second round, 45th overall of the 1990 NBA draft. He initially went on to play with professional teams in Europe, rather than play in the NBA. He played with Panathinaikos in the Greek League from 1990 to 1992, and with Philips Milano of the Italian League, during the 1992–93 season.

Davis also played in Europe&#x27;s 3rd-tier level league, the FIBA Korać Cup, with both teams and while he was with Milano, he won the Korać Cup championship in the 1992–93 season.

==NBA career==

===Early career===

====Indiana Pacers====

In 1993, Davis returned to the United States to play in the NBA for the 1993–94 season when he signed with the Indiana Pacers as a free agent. As a rookie off the bench, Davis played in 81 games and helped the Pacers to the playoffs where they swept the Orlando Magic in three straight games then upset the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks in six games in the first two rounds en route to facing the Patrick Ewing-led New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Pacers dropped the first two games in New York before rebounding to take the next two in Indiana; in game five in New York teammate Reggie Miller scored 25 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Pacers to the victory. The Pacers then returned to Indianapolis with the chance to clinch the Eastern Conference title but lost both game six and the series.

The next year the Pacers won 52 games and the Central Division title thanks to the addition of Mark Jackson; Davis meanwhile played in 44 games averaging 7.6 points a game with 6.4 rebounds a game as he missed significant time due to injury. In the playoffs the Pacers faced the Atlanta Hawks for the second consecutive season. The Pacers swept the Hawks in three straight games, then found themselves in a rematch with the Knicks in the second round; in game one (which saw the ejections of Davis and Derek Harper) teammate Reggie Miller made a three-pointer and then stole the inbounds pass and tied the game with another three-pointer right in front of Knicks fan Spike Lee who was just a few feet away. Miller added 2 free throws and gave the Pacers a comeback win. The Pacers lost Game 2 and the series returned to Indiana. After four games, the Pacers took a 3–1 series lead; however, the Knicks bounced back and forces the seventh game at Madison Square Garden. The Pacers emerged victorious as Patrick Ewing&#x27;s last-second shot did not go in the basket. With a 1-point win, the Pacers qualified for the Eastern Conference Finals for the second consecutive season. As with their first and second-round opponents, the Pacers played a young talented Orlando Magic team led by Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Penny Hardaway in a rematch of the previous postseason. The Pacers pushed Orlando to a 7th game before losing the series.

The following season was the most challenging in franchise history but despite that the Pacers duplicated their record from the previous season, 52–30, with Davis averaging 8.8 points a game with 6.1 rebounds a game. In the playoffs, the Pacers were defeated by the sixth-seeded Atlanta Hawks in five games.
In the 1996–97 season the Pacers finished sixth in the Central Division with a record of 39–43 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1989 despite Davis playing in 82 games, starting 28 of them and averaging 10.5 points with 7.3 rebounds a game. The next year the Pacers bounced back and won 58 games and the second seed in the Eastern Conference (with the additions of former Boston Celtics player Larry Bird as head coach and veteran all-star Chris Mullin) with Davis playing in 82 games for the third year in a row while starting 12 of them and averaging 9.6 points a game and 6.8 rebounds a game, in the postseason the Pacers defeated the Shawn Kemp-led Cleveland Cavaliers and Ewing-led New York Knicks in the first two rounds before being matched up with the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals, after losing the first two games in Chicago, the Pacers responded by winning games three and four to forced a deciding game five back in Chicago, a game in which the Bulls won by a score of 106–87 to force a deciding sixth game back in Indiana, game six would be a hard-fought game in which the Pacers won by a score of 92–89 to send the series back to the United Center in Chicago for a deciding seventh game of the series, in game seven the Pacers fought and claw their way to every possession but it was not enough in the end as the eventual champion Bulls still prevailed by a score of 88–83 to win the series.

The Pacers entered the season as a heavy favorite because Michael Jordan had retired and other members of the Chicago Bulls were broken up by their management. After a four-month lockout, the Pacers won the Central Division with a record of 33 wins and 17 losses and although he was unable to break into the first team Davis still averaged 9.4 points a game, with 7.0 rebounds a game solidifying his role as rebounder shot blocker and inside scorer. In the playoffs the Pacers swept the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round, and the Philadelphia 76ers in the semifinals advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals for the second consecutive season, and for the fourth time in six seasons. Once again, the Pacers were up against the New York Knicks. Each game was nip and tuck with both teams trading wins as the Knicks won games one, three (a game best-remembered for Davis fouling Larry Johnson on a four-point play) and five while the Pacers won games two and four to set up a sixth game back at Madison Square Garden in New York. After fighting their way through most of the first three quarters the Pacers lost game six and the series to the Knicks, (marking the second year in a row and fourth overall that the Pacers lost in the Eastern Conference Finals). With a couple of Eastern Conference Finals disappointments coupled with Davis begging for more playing time, Davis announced his intentions to be traded.

===Toronto Raptors===

====1999–2000 season====
On August 1, 1999, Davis was traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for the 5th pick of the 1999 NBA draft in high schooler Jonathan Bender. In the 1999–00 season he solidified his role as a starter and started almost all 79 games that he appeared in. He averaged 11.5 points, 8.8 rebounds with 1.3 blocks for the Raptors as they won 45 games and advanced to the playoffs for the first time in franchise history where they faced a strong, talented New York Knicks team now led by Ewing, Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston in the first round. The Knicks swept the Raptors in three games, despite Davis averaging 13.0 points with 8.3 rebounds and 1.3 blocks a game.

====2000–2001 season====
In the 2000–01 season, Davis had his most productive season yet, averaging 13.7 points, with 10.1 rebounds plus 1.4 blocks a game and was elected to the NBA All-Star Team for the first and only time in his career. That season the Raptors won 47 games, good enough for second place in the Central Division and advanced to the playoffs for the second year in a row, where they faced a talented Knicks team led by Sprewell and Houston and no longer featured Ewing. The Raptors defeated the Knicks in five games including a 93–89 game five victory with 14 points, 12 rebounds, and 2 blocks from Davis. In the second round, the Raptors matched up against the top-seeded Philadelphia 76ers led by league MVP Allen Iverson and defensive lynchpin Dikembe Mutombo. Every game was neck and neck with both teams trading wins in the first six games of the series, especially a game six win by the Raptors featuring a score of 101–89 with Davis scoring 17 points, grabbing 13 rebounds and blocking 2 shots despite being bothered by a strained triceps muscle in his left arm. In-game seven (a game that would prove to be the most memorable of the series), the first three quarters were nip and tuck with both teams trading leads entering the fourth quarter, and although the Raptors lost game seven to the Sixers by a score of 88–87 and the series, Davis, for the most part, enjoyed a very good series averaging 16.9 points with 11.1 rebounds and 1.8 blocks a game.

====2001–2002 season====
The 2001–02 season however would be even better for Davis as he averaged his most points per game for a season yet at 14.5 points, with 9.6 rebounds and 2.0 blocks a game. Although they regressed from 47 wins from a year ago to 42, the Raptors still advanced to the playoffs for the third year in a row, where they faced their Central Division rivals (also great lakes rivals) the Detroit Pistons led by All-star Jerry Stackhouse and rebounding specialist Ben Wallace in the first round. After losing the first two games in Detroit, the Raptors responded by winning the next two games in Toronto, including a 94–84 game three victory thanks to a 30-point 8 rebound performance from Davis to send the series back to Detroit for a deciding game 5. That would prove to be the most memorable game of the series. The game was nip and tuck with both teams trading leads throughout the game and although the Raptors lost Game 5 to the Pistons by a score of 85–82 and the series, Davis enjoyed his best playoff series yet as he increased his playoff production to 17.0 points with 10.6 rebounds and 1.0 blocks a game.

====2002–2003 season====
The 2002–03 season would prove to be the most difficult season for the Raptors in franchise history as they struggled with injuries all season long and sputtered to a 24–58 record, missing the playoffs for the first time since 1999 despite Davis averaging 13.9 points with 8.2 rebounds a game.

====2003–2004 season====
In the 2003–04 season despite being bothered by trade rumors, Davis still averaged double-doubles for stretches of the season including 14 points with 12 rebounds in a home win against the New Jersey Nets, followed by 13 points with 12 rebounds in a home win against the Dallas Mavericks and finally 10 points with 11 rebounds in a road win against the Atlanta Hawks and his last game with the Raptors against the Orlando Magic, Davis scored 15 points and grabbed 8 rebounds in a road win against the Magic, thus ending an era of Toronto Raptors basketball in which had relied on him as a second-leading scorer, rebounder and defensive presence inside.

===Chicago Bulls===
That season, he was traded to the Chicago Bulls, where he fit in well as a veteran influence on a young team that included Tyson Chandler, Eddy Curry and Kirk Hinrich, although his overall averages decreased from previous years Davis continued to be relied on for his scoring, rebounding and shot-blocking and in the 2004–05 season, Davis averaged 7.0 points with 5.9 rebounds for the season as the Bulls won 47 games and advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1998 where they faced the Washington Wizards led by Gilbert Arenas, Antawn Jamison, and Larry Hughes in the first round, the Bulls would lose to the Wizards in six games. Davis averaged 9.5 points a game with 6.8 rebounds in 6 playoff games. That summer Davis was elected the President of the NBA Players&#x27; Association at the union&#x27;s annual convention on June 28, 2005.

===New York Knicks===

Just before the start of the training camp of the 2005–06 season, Davis was traded along with Curry to the New York Knicks for Michael Sweetney, Tim Thomas and Jermaine Jackson. Through 36 games with the Knicks, Davis averaged 5.0 points with 4.8 rebounds a game. Davis had a season-high of 14 rebounds along with 3 points and 1 assist in a loss against the Wizards and had 11 points and five rebounds with 2 assists and 2 steal as the Knicks defeated the Bulls by a score of 109–101, then a few weeks later he had 11 points again with 9 rebounds as the Knicks defeated the Mavericks by a score of 117–115.

====Fan incident====
On January 18, 2006, Davis was ejected from a Knicks-Bulls game for going into the stands and confronting a fan he alleges was intoxicated and abusive. He said he was concerned about his wife, whom he thought he had seen falling back and being touched by the fan. His wife claims that the fan was using inappropriate language around the Davis&#x27; child and that she had asked him to stop, which then prompted harassment from the fan. Though public opinion allegedly swung in Davis&#x27; favor, the NBA suspended him for five games on January 19. The fan in question, Michael Axelrod, the son of David Axelrod, the 2008 campaign manager for Barack Obama, has stated that he was attacked by Davis&#x27; wife, and his lawyer revealed plans to sue for roughly a million dollars and a public apology by the Davis family. Mr. Davis responded by stating, &quot;I&#x27;m not apologizing to anybody for anything.&quot; On January 23, Davis and Axelrod settled their disputes outside of court, issuing the following joint statement.

&quot;It&#x27;s clear that the episode at the United Center last week, and its aftermath, evolved from some misunderstandings. This has produced regrets from all parties involved. Common sense strongly suggests that we collectively put this episode behind us and move on. That&#x27;s what the Davis&#x27; and Michael Axelrod plan to do, and we hope everyone else will, as well.&quot;

===Return to Raptors===
On February 3, 2006, Davis was traded back to the Raptors for Jalen Rose and a first-round draft pick (from the Denver Nuggets), and an undisclosed sum of cash (believed to be around $3 million). In his first game back with the Raptors, Davis scored 7 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in an overtime loss to the San Antonio Spurs, Davis went on to start the next seven games for the Raptors before missing the next twelve with an ailing back injury. On March 23, 2006, Davis was released by the Raptors after his injury was diagnosed by the team&#x27;s doctors as being season-ending.

==National team career==
Davis played for United States national team in the 1989 Tournament of the Americas and 2002 FIBA World Championship, winning the silver medal in the 1989 event.

<doc id="1260717" wikidata="Q1885960" url="?curid=1260717" title="Newlib">
<text>Newlib is a C standard library implementation intended for use on embedded systems. It is a conglomeration of several library parts, all under free software licenses that make them easily usable on embedded products. 

It was created by Cygnus Support as part of building the first GNU cross-development toolchains. It is now maintained by Red Hat developers Jeff Johnston and Corinna Vinschen, and is used in most commercial and non-commercial GCC ports for non-Linux embedded systems.

== System Calls ==
The section System Calls of the Newlib documentation describes how it can be used with many operating systems. Its primary use is on embedded systems that lack any kind of operating system; in that case it calls a board support package that can do things like write a byte of output on a serial port, or read a sector from a disk or other memory device.

== Inclusion ==
Newlib is included in commercial GCC distributions by Atollic, CodeSourcery, Code Red, KPIT, Red Hat and others, and receives support from major embedded-processor architecture vendors such as ARM and Renesas. It is used as the standard C library in Cygwin, as well as being one standard C library among several for AmigaOS 4.

, KallistiOS, an independent SDK targeting the Sega Dreamcast, has used Newlib as its standard C library, shipping it with many commercial titles on the platform.

, devkitARM and devkitPPC, toolchains targeted at homebrew development for commercial game systems, include Newlib as their C library. The Open-R SDK for Sony AIBO is also based on Newlib on top of the non-Unix Aperios.

, Google Native Client SDK (NaCl) includes Newlib as the default C library over glibc.

In 2019, Keith Packard released &quot;Picolibc&quot;, a library offering standard C library APIs that targets small embedded systems with limited RAM, based on blending code from Newlib and AVR Libc.

<doc id="1260731" wikidata="Q160159" url="?curid=1260731" title="Arrow Cross Party">
<text>The Arrow Cross Party (, , abbreviated NYKP) was a far-right Hungarian ultranationalist party led by Ferenc Szálasi, which formed a government in Hungary they named the Government of National Unity. They were in power from 15 October 1944 to 28 March 1945. During its short rule, ten to fifteen thousand civilians were murdered outright, including many Jews and Romani, and 80,000 people were deported from Hungary to concentration camps in Austria. After the war, Szálasi and other Arrow Cross leaders were tried as war criminals by Hungarian courts.

==Formation==
The party was founded by Ferenc Szálasi in 1935 as the &quot;Party of National Will&quot;. It had its origins in the political philosophy of pro-German extremists such as Gyula Gömbös, who coined the term &quot;national socialism&quot; in the 1920s. The party was outlawed in 1937 but was reconstituted in 1939 as the Arrow Cross Party, and was modelled fairly explicitly on the Nazi Party of Germany, although Szálasi often harshly criticized the Nazi regime of Germany.

==Emblem and symbolism==
The party&#x27;s iconography was clearly inspired by that of the Nazis.

The &quot;Nyilaskereszt&quot; (&quot;arrow cross&quot;) emblem was considered to be a symbol of the Magyar tribes who, from the late 9th century, conquered and settled in what became Hungary. In emulating the central role of the swastika in Nazi ideology, the arrow cross also alluded to the purported racial purity of the Magyars, in the same way that the swastika was intended to allude to the purported racial purity of the Germans.

The arrow cross symbol had other ideological implications, including a desire to nullify the Treaty of Trianon, and expand the Hungarian state in all cardinal directions, out to the borders of the former Kingdom of Hungary.

==Ideology==
The party&#x27;s ideology was similar to those of Nazism and Fascism and it combined aspects of those ideologies with Hungarian Turanism, forming an ideology which Ferenc Szálasi called &quot;Hungarism&quot;. It combined nationalism, the promotion of agriculture, anti-capitalism, anti-communism and a special type of anti-Semitism, called &quot;a-Semitism&quot;. In a series of four books on Hungarism, Szálasi distinguished a-Semitism, which called for a society which should be completely absent of Jews, from anti-Semitism, which, he argued, would nominally allow Jews to exist in a particular society with limited rights. He argued that a-Semitism was not opposed to the existence of Jews per se, instead, it regarded their existence as being incompatible with European society. Szálasi extended this argument to Arabs, and he also extended it to the whole &quot;semitic race&quot;. The party and its leader originally opposed German geopolitical ambitions, so Hitler was slow to accept Szálasi&#x27;s &quot;connationalism&quot;, the support of nationalist movements within their historical territories and spheres of influence on the grounds of historical evidence of cultural dominance. This concept was poorly understood by the Germans because it combined nationalism and internationalism, the co-operation of nationalist movements. Consequently, the party judged Jews in racial as well as religious terms. It believed that Jews were incapable of being integrated into any society which was outside the place and culture of their historical origins. Although the Arrow Cross Party was certainly far more racist than the Horthy regime was, it differed from the German Nazi Party. It was also more economically radical than other fascist movements were, and advocated some workers&#x27; rights and land reforms.

==Rise to power==

The roots of Arrow Cross influence can be traced to the antisemitism that followed the Communist putsch, the creation of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, and Red Terror during the spring and summer of 1919. Most Communist leaders were from Jewish families such as Tibor Szamuely. Béla Kun, the Republic&#x27;s leader and instigator of the Terror, had a secular Jewish father and a mother who, despite converting to the Reformed Church of Hungary, was still seen as being a Jew. Many antisemitic writers before the Second World War, such as Leon de Poncins used this fact to propagate the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory. 

The Hungarian Soviet Republic&#x27;s policies were credited by some anti-communists as being part of a &quot;Judeo-Bolshevist conspiracy.&quot; 

After the Soviet Republic was overthrown in August 1919, conservative authoritarians under the leadership of Admiral Miklós Horthy seized control. Many Hungarian military officers took part in the counter-reprisals known as the White Terror – parts of which were directed at Jews. Although the White Guard was officially suppressed, many of its most prevalent members went underground and formed the core membership of a spreading nationalist antisemitic movement.

During the 1930s, the Arrow Cross began to dominate Budapest&#x27;s working class neighborhoods, defeating the Social Democrats. The Social Democrats did not contest elections effectively and they were forced into a pact with the conservative Horthy regime in order to prevent their abolition. The Arrow Cross recruited from the poorest members of society, including the chronically unemployed, alcoholics, ex-convicts, prisoners, rapists, and the uneducated. These members later committed some of the most brutal crimes against Jews, intellectuals, socialists, and other civilians.

The Arrow Cross subscribed to the Nazi ideology of &quot;master races&quot;, which, in Szálasi&#x27;s view, included the Hungarians and Germans, and also supported the concept of an order based on the power of the strongest – what Szálasi called a &quot;brutally realistic étatism&quot;. But its espousal of territorial claims under the banner of a &quot;Greater Hungary&quot; and Hungarian values (&quot;Hungarizmus&quot; or &quot;Hungarianism&quot;) clashed with Nazi ambitions, delaying Hitler&#x27;s endorsement of that party by several years.

The German Foreign Office instead endorsed the pro-German Hungarian National Socialist Party, which had some supporters among ethnic Germans. Before World War II, the Arrow Cross were not proponents of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis, but utilised traditional stereotypes and prejudices to gain votes among voters both in Budapest and the countryside. Nonetheless, the constant bickering among these diverse fascist groups prevented the Arrow Cross Party from gaining more support and power.

The Arrow Cross obtained most of its support from a disparate coalition of military officers, soldiers, nationalists and agricultural workers. It was only one of several similar fascist factions in Hungary but was by far the most prominent, through effective recruiting. In the only election it participated in, in May 1939, the party won 15% of the vote and 29 seats in the Hungarian Parliament but this was only superficially impressive as most Hungarians were not permitted to vote. It did become one of the most powerful parties in Hungary but the Horthy leadership banned the Arrow Cross on the outbreak of World War II, forcing it to operate clandestinely.

In 1944, the Arrow Cross Party&#x27;s fortunes abruptly reversed when Hitler lost patience with Horthy&#x27;s and his moderate prime minister&#x27;s, Miklós Kállay&#x27;s, reluctance to fully toe the Nazi line. In March 1944, the Germans invaded and occupied Hungary, which resulted in Kállay fleeing, and a Nazi proxy, Döme Sztójay, replacing him who quickly legalised the Arrow Cross.

During the spring and summer of 1944, more than 400,000 Jews were driven into centralised ghettos and then deported from the Hungarian countryside to death camps by the Nazis, with the enthusiastic assistance of the Hungarian Interior Ministry and its gendarmerie (the &quot;csendőrség&quot;), both of which had members closely linked to the Arrow Cross. Budapest Jews were forced into Yellow Star Houses, approximately 2,000 single-building mini-ghettos identified by a yellow Star of David at the entrance. In August 1944, before deportations from Budapest began, Horthy used what remaining influence he had to stop them, and force the radical antisemites out of his government.

As the summer progressed, and with the Allied and Soviet armies closing in on central Europe, the ability of the Nazis to devote resources to Hungary&#x27;s &quot;Jewish Solution&quot; waned, but they still carried out many massacres. Jews were often rounded up on the streets by Arrow Cross men, and their standard procedure was to take children away from their parents, then killing or beating any parent or child who protested. The Arrow Cross repeatedly organized mass murders next to the Danube, shooting people in the head, with the bodies falling into the river. To save bullets, their favorite method was to tie the waists of three people together with wire and shoot only the middle person, who would fall forward into the river drowning the other two as the weight of the copse dragged them to the bottom of the Danube. It has been estimated that during the autumn of 1944 there were no more than 4,000 members of the Arrow Cross in Budapest, yet despite this they were able to terrorize the city&#x27;s population of a million. Their methods eventually became too sickening even for the German military whose commander General Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch ordered his troops not to take part in the killings. On the other hand, the German envoy to Hungary Edmund Veesenmayer received orders from Berlin to provide as much assistance as he could to the Arrow Cross in killing of Jews. 
Eventually Szálasi became concerned about the impression that neutral diplomats were forming of his government and ordered that the killings be undertaken with more discretion. The country&#x27;s national police commissioner Pál Hódosy concurred, &quot;The problem is not that the Jews are being murdered... the trouble is the method. The bodies must be made to disappear, not put out on the streets.&quot; This view was shared by parliamentarian Károlyl Maróthy who said &quot;Something must be done to stop the death rattle going on in the ditches day and night... the population must not be able to see them dying&quot;

==Arrow Cross rule==

In October 1944, Horthy negotiated a cease-fire with the Soviets and ordered Hungarian troops to lay down their arms. In response, Nazi Germany launched the covert Operation Panzerfaust which took Horthy into &quot;protective custody&quot; in Germany and forced him to abdicate. Szálasi was made &quot;Leader of the Nation&quot; and prime minister of an Arrow Cross-dominated &quot;Government of National Unity&quot; the same day.

By this time, Soviet and Romanian forces had pushed deep into Hungarian territory. As a result, the Szálasi government&#x27;s authority was limited to an ever-narrowing band of territory around Budapest. In this context, Arrow Cross rule was short and brutal. In under three months, their death squads killed as many as 38,000 Hungarian Jews. Arrow Cross officers helped Adolf Eichmann re-start deportations from which the Jews of Budapest had thus far been spared, sending some 80,000 Jews out of the city on slave labour details and many more straight to death camps. Virtually all Jewish males of conscription age were already serving as slave labour for the Hungarian Army&#x27;s Forced Labor Battalions. Most died, including many who were murdered as they were returning home after the end of the fighting.

Red Army troops reached the outskirts of Budapest in December 1944, and the siege of the city began. Arrow Cross members and the Germans may have conspired to destroy the Budapest ghetto but any evidence remains disputed. Days before fleeing, Arrow Cross Interior Minister Gábor Vajna ordered that streets and squares named for Jews be renamed.

As control of the city&#x27;s institutions weakened, the Arrow Cross trained their guns on the most helpless possible targets including patients in the city&#x27;s two Jewish hospitals on Maros Street and Bethlen Square, remaining women and children, and residents in the Jewish poorhouse on Alma Road. As order collapsed, Arrow Cross members continued their attacks on Jews so that the majority of Budapest&#x27;s Jews were only saved by the heroic efforts of a handful of Jewish leaders and foreign diplomats, most famously Sweden&#x27;s special envoy Raoul Wallenberg, the Papal Nuncio Monsignor Angelo Rotta, Swiss Consul Carl Lutz, Spanish Consul Ángel Sanz Briz and the Italian cattle trader Giorgio Perlasca.

The Arrow Cross government effectively fell at the end of January 1945, when the Soviet Army took Pest and the Axis forces retreated across the Danube to Buda. Szálasi had escaped from Budapest on December 11, 1944, taking with him the Hungarian royal crown, while Arrow Cross members and German forces continued to fight a rear-guard action in the far west of Hungary until the end of the war in April 1945.

==Post-war developments==
After the war, many Arrow Cross leaders were captured and tried for war crimes and no fewer than 6,200 indictments for murder were served against Arrow Cross men in just a few months. Some Arrow Cross officials were executed, including Szálasi.

A memorial which was created by , Hungarian sculptor, and Can Togay in 2005 on the bank of the Danube River in Budapest honors the Jews who were shot there by Arrow Cross militiamen, between 1944 and 1945. The victims were forced to remove their shoes, all of which were confiscated later, and then shot so that their bodies would fall into the river.

In 2006, a former high-ranking member, Lajos Polgár, was found in Melbourne, Australia. He died of natural causes in July of that year after the war crimes case against him was dropped.

To some extent, the ideology of the Arrow Cross has resurfaced in recent years, with the neofascist Hungarian Welfare Association being prominent in reviving Szálasi&#x27;s &quot;Hungarizmus&quot; through its monthly magazine, &quot;Magyartudat&quot; (&quot;Hungarian Awareness&quot;) but &quot;Hungarism&quot; remains a fringe element in modern Hungarian politics, and the Hungarian Welfare Association has dissolved.

<text>The Crossroads Guitar Festival is a series of music festivals and benefit concerts founded by Eric Clapton. The festivals benefit the Crossroads Centre founded by Eric Clapton, a drug treatment center in Antigua. The concerts showcase a variety of guitarists, selected by Eric Clapton personally. To the 2007 audience, Clapton declared that each performer was one of the very best, and had earned his personal respect.

The first concert was held on June 30, 1999, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, and there again in 2013. The 2004 concert was held at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, while the 2007 and 2010 festivals were held at Toyota Park, Bridgeview, Illinois, just outside Chicago. The festival returned to Dallas in 2019 at the American Airlines Center.

==1999 festival==
The first Crossroads Benefit concert was held at Madison Square Garden, New York on June 30, 1999. It was held under a different title which was Eric Clapton &amp; Friends In Concert: A Benefit For The Crossroads Centre At Antigua. The first official Crossroads Guitar Festival did not happen until 2004. 

=== Performers ===
Some performers at the 1999 Concert were David Sanborn, Sheryl Crow, Bob Dylan and Mary J Blige. Backup musicians included Nathan East (bass), Steve Gadd (drums) Andy Fairweather Low (guitars), Tim Carmon (keyboards) and Dave Delhomme (keyboards). Back-up vocals were by Tessa Niles and Katie Kissoon.

<text>The Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (, AAK) is a right-wing political party in Kosovo.

==Leadership==
The party was formed on 29 April 2001 after having previously operated as a coalition of five parties since 2 May 2000. Founder and the current president of the party is Ramush Haradinaj. In December 2004 the parliament elected him as Prime Minister of Kosovo and he formed a coalition government with the largest party, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK). He resigned as Prime Minister in March 2005 after learning that he had been indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, for 37 counts of war crimes. He received a full acquittal from the Tribunal on 3 April 2008. He returned to Kosovo and immediately resumed his duties as president of the party.

The AAK currently has three deputy presidents: Blerim Shala, Naim Maloku and Ahmet Isufi.

The current Secretary General is Burim Ramadani and the Secretary of Organisation is Ibrahim Selmanaj.

==In Parliament==
At the last legislative elections held on 17 November 2007, the alliance won 9.6% of the popular vote and 10 out of 120 seats in the Assembly of Kosovo, which made it the fifth largest political force. This was a gain on the previous two legislative elections in 2001 and 2004 in which the AAK won 7.8% and 8.4% of the popular vote, respectively.

The AAK&#x27;s eight current members of parliament are: Ramush Haradinaj, who is the leader of AAK, Shemsedin Dreshaj, Besnik Tahiri, Bekë Berisha, Pal Lekaj, Albena Reshitaj, Albana Bytyqi and Time Kadrijaj also serves as the AAK&#x27;s member of the Assembly Presidency.

Currently they are part of the opposition team together with PDK, LDK and the Serb List

==Local elections==
At the municipal elections held on 17 November 2007, the AAK gained control of 3 municipalities in western Kosovo: Peja, Gjakova and Deçan.

At the municipal elections held on 15 November 2007, the party gained 8 of 37 municipalities of Kosovo.

==Political position==
AAK is located slightly to the right on the political spectrum. It is generally considered an Albanian nationalist party.

==Party name and symbols==
The party flag is red, black and white. White represents peace; red and black are the national colours of the 96% Albanian majority of Kosovo.

The choice of the party&#x27;s name, Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) is explained in Ramush Haradinaj&#x27;s second book. Whereas previous Kosovo party acronyms began with consonants, a vowel was chosen for AAK because it seems less harsh and more open. The word &quot;future&quot; was chosen to mark a break with the old communist tendency to reflect backwards upon one&#x27;s history. Finally, &quot;alliance&quot; was chosen because of its association with the NATO alliance which is much revered in Kosovo for its intervention in the Kosovo War of 1999, and also because it evokes the idea of working together to achieve one&#x27;s aims. The alliance was originally formed by several smaller parties:
*People&#x27;s Movement of Kosovo (&quot;Lëvizja Popullore e Kosovës - LPK&quot;)
*Parliamentary Party of Kosovo (&quot;Partia Parlamentare e Kosovës&quot;)
*Civic Alliance of Kosovo (&quot;Aleanca Qytetare e Kosovës&quot;)
*National Movement for the Liberation of Kosovo (&quot;Lëvizja Kombëtare për Çlirimin e Kosovës&quot;)
*Party of Albanian National Union (&quot;Partia e Unitetit Kombëtar Shqiptar&quot;)
*Albanian Union of Christian Democrats (&quot;Unioni Shqiptar Demokristian&quot;)

<text>Everyone Poops is the title of US editions of the English translation (by Amanda Mayer Stinchecum) of , a Japanese children&#x27;s book written and illustrated by the prolific children&#x27;s author Tarō Gomi and first published in Japan by Fukuinkan Shoten in 1977 within the series .

The English translation has been published in the US by Kane/Miller, within the series &quot;My Body Science&quot;, and by Scholastic. In Britain, the book is titled Everybody Poos and is published by Frances Lincoln.

The book tells children that all animals defecate and that they have always done so. The book is intended to relieve shame and embarrassment around the act of defecating by explaining to children that it is a natural part of life.

The book has also been translated into Spanish and Thai.

==Story==
&quot;Everyone Poops&quot; does not have a plot. The first sixteen pages contain various prompts regarding defecation in animals such as opposites (&quot;An elephant makes a big poop&quot; and &quot;[a] mouse makes a tiny poop&quot;), comparisons (that various species produce various sizes and shapes of poop) and questions (&quot;What does whale poop look like?&quot;).

On the seventeenth page, a boy with black overalls and a red shirt is introduced, seen running into a bathroom. The book then goes on to explain how people of all ages, from adults to very young children, defecate, and how infants may use diapers. After that, there are only three more illustrations that do not feature the boy. On the next page of the book, the child uses toilet paper and flushes the toilet. The final portion of the book explains that because every animal eats, they must therefore defecate, and the book ends with rear views of the boy and six different animals defecating and the words &quot;Everyone Poops&quot;.

==Publication==
&quot;Everyone Poops&quot; was written by Tarō Gomi, and first published by Tokyo-based Fukuinkan Shoten as &quot;Minna Unchi&quot; in 1977.

It was acquired by Kane/Miller in 1993. Kane/Miller was later bought by Educational Development Corporation. &quot;Everyone Poops&quot; is the best-known title sold by the company. This book is sold in the U.S. through traditional bookstores such as Barnes &amp; Noble and on the party plan by independent booksellers.

<doc id="1260772" wikidata="Q1076110" url="?curid=1260772" title="Kosher foods">
<text>Kosher foods are foods that conform to the Jewish dietary regulations of &quot;kashrut&quot; (dietary law). The laws of &quot;kashrut&quot; apply to food derived from living creatures and kosher foods are restricted to certain types of mammals, birds and fish meeting specific criteria; the flesh of any animals that do not meet these criteria is forbidden by the dietary laws. Furthermore, kosher mammals and birds must be slaughtered according to a process known as and their blood may never be consumed and must be removed from the meat by a process of salting and soaking in water for the meat to be permissible for use. All plant-based products, including fruits, vegetables, grains, herbs and spices, are intrinsically kosher, although certain produce grown in the Land of Israel is subjected to other requirements, such as tithing, before it may be consumed. 

Kosher food also distinguishes between meat and dairy products. Meat products are those that comprise or contain kosher meat, such as beef, lamb or venison, kosher poultry such as chicken, goose, duck or turkey, or derivatives of meat, such as animal gelatin; non-animal products that are processed on equipment used for meat or meat-derived products are also considered to belong to this category. Dairy products are those which contain milk or any derivatives such as butter or cheese; non-dairy products that are processed on equipment used for milk or milk-derived products are also considered as belonging to this category. Because of this categorization, meat and milk or their respective derivatives are not combined in kosher foods, and separate equipment for the storage and preparation of meat-based and dairy-based foods is used in order for food to be considered kosher. 

Another category of kosher food, called contains neither meat, milk nor their derivatives; they include foods such as fish, eggs from permitted birds, produce, grains, fruit and other edible plants. They remain pareve if they are not mixed with or processed using equipment that is used for any meat or dairy products. 

Because of the complexities of modern food manufacturing, kashrut agencies supervise or inspect the production of kosher foods and provide a certification called a hechsher to verify for kosher food consumers that it has been produced in accordance with Jewish law.

Jewish dietary law is primarily derived from Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14:1-21. Foods that may be consumed according to Jewish religious law are termed &quot;kosher&quot; () in English, from the Ashkenazi pronunciation of the Hebrew term &quot;kashér&quot; (), meaning &quot;fit&quot; (in this context, fit for consumption). Foods that are not in accordance with Jewish law are called &quot;treif&quot; (; , derived from &quot;ṭərēfā&quot;) meaning &quot;torn.&quot;

==Permitted and forbidden animals==

The Torah permits eating only those land animals that chew their cud and have cloven hooves. Four animals, the hare, hyrax, camel, and pig, are specifically identified as being forbidden because they possess only one of the above characteristics: the hare, hyrax and camel are hindgut fermenters and chew their cud but do not have cloven hooves, while the pig has a cloven hoof but does not chew its cud.

The Torah lists winged creatures that may not be consumed, mainly birds of prey, fish-eating water-birds, and bats. Certain domesticated fowl can be eaten, such as chicken, geese, quail, dove, and turkey.

The Torah permits only those fish which have both fins and scales to be eaten. Monkfish is not considered kosher. To comply with kosher requirements, a fish must have fins and easily detachable scales; the scales of a sturgeon are extremely hard to remove, hence it is non-kosher. Other seafood considered non-kosher includes shellfish like clams, oysters, crabs and shrimp. There is also risk of products like seaweed and kelp being contaminated by microscopic, non-kosher crustaceans.

The Torah forbids two types of (creeping or swarming things): 
* Earth crawlers, e.g. mouse, lizard
* Flying creeping things, with four exceptions: Two types of locust, the cricket, and the grasshopper (translations of the species names vary).

==Animal products==
In addition to meat, products of forbidden species and from unhealthy animals were banned by the Talmudic writers. This included eggs (including fish roe), as well as derived products such as jelly, but did not include materials merely &quot;manufactured&quot; or &quot;gathered&quot; by animals, such as honey (although, in the case of honey from animals other than bees, there was a difference of opinion among the ancient writers).

According to the rabbinical writers, eggs from ritually pure animals would always be prolate (&quot;pointy&quot;) at one end and oblate (&quot;rounded&quot;) at the other, helping to reduce uncertainty about whether consumption was permitted or not.

===Dairy products===
The classic rabbinical writers imply that milk from an animal whose meat is kosher is also kosher. As animals are considered non-kosher if they are discovered to have been diseased after being slaughtered, this could make their milk retroactively non-kosher.

However, by adhering to the principle that the majority case overrules the exception, Jewish tradition continues to regard such milk as kosher, since statistically it is true that most animals producing such milk are kosher; the same principle is not applied to the possibility of consuming meat from an animal that has not been checked for disease.

Hershel Schachter argued that with modern dairy-farm equipment, milk from the minority of non-kosher cows is invariably mixed with that of the majority of kosher cows, thus invalidating the permissibility of consuming milk from a large dairy operation. Many leading rabbis, however, rule milk permissible, as do major &quot;kashrut&quot; authorities.

====Human breast milk====
Breast milk from a woman is permitted. However, authorities assert breast milk may be consumed directly from the breasts only by children younger than four (five if the child is ill), and children older than two were only permitted to continue to suckle if they had not stopped doing so for more than three consecutive days.

===Cheese===
The situation of cheese is complicated as hard cheese often involves rennet, an enzyme that splits milk into curds and whey.

Many forms of rennet are derived from the stomach linings of animals, but since the 1990s rennet is often made recombinantly in microbes because it can be produced more efficiently (though many artisanal cheeses and cheeses made in Europe still use animal rennet).

Because the rennet could be derived from animals, it could potentially be non-kosher. Rennet made recombinantly, or from the stomachs of kosher animals, if they have been slaughtered according to the laws of &quot;kashrut&quot;, can be kosher. Cheese made from plant-derived rennet can also be kosher. Many authorities require that the cheese-making process follow certain stringencies to be kosher.

According to the Shulchan Aruch, a rabbinic decree (called &quot;gevinat akum&quot;) prohibits all cheese made by non-Jews without Jewish supervision, even if its ingredients are all kosher, because very frequently the rennet in cheese is not kosher. Rabbeinu Tam and some of the geonim suggested that this decree does not apply in a location where cheese is commonly made with only kosher ingredients, a position that was practiced in communities in Narbonne and Italy.

Many contemporary Orthodox authorities do not follow this ruling, and hold that cheese requires formal &quot;kashrut&quot; certification to be kosher; some even argue this is necessary for cheese made with non-animal rennet. However, some such as Joseph B. Soloveitchik ate generic cheeses without certification. Isaac Klein&#x27;s &quot;tshuva&quot; authorized the use of cheese made from non-kosher rennet, and this is widely practised by observant Conservative Jews and Conservative institutions.

===Eggs===
The eggs of kosher birds are kosher. Eggs are considered &quot;pareve&quot; despite being an animal product.

====Blood found in eggs====
Occasionally blood spots are found within an egg, which can affect the kosher status of the egg. The &quot;halacha&quot; varies depending on whether or not there is a possibility of the egg being fertilized.

If the egg may have been fertilized, the Rishonim and Shulchan Aruch suggest a complex set of rules for determining whether the egg may be eaten; among these rules, if blood appears on the yolk, the entire egg is forbidden.
To avoid the complexity of these rules, Moshe Isserles records a custom not to eat any such eggs with blood spots.

If the egg was definitely unfertilized (laid by a hen kept isolated from roosters), many authorities (including Moshe Feinstein and Ovadia Yosef—the former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel) rule that one may remove the blood spot and then eat the remainder of the egg. This is the case nowadays, when battery eggs form the majority of available produce.

Regarding the question of whether one must check an egg for blood spots, the Shulchan Aruch rules that one may eat hard-boiled eggs where checking is impossible. Moshe Isserles adds that checking is not required, but that a custom exists to check eggs if they are cracked during the daytime (when blood could be seen).

A contemporary Ashkenazi authority writes that while &quot;&quot;halacha&quot; does not require&quot; checking supermarket-bought eggs, &quot;there is a &quot;minhag&quot;&quot; to do so. Nevertheless, eggs are not checked in commercial settings where doing so would be expensive.

===Gelatin===

Gelatin is hydrolysed collagen, the main protein in animal connective tissue, and therefore could potentially come from a non-kosher source, such as pig skin. Gelatin has historically been a prominent source of glue, finding uses from musical instruments to embroidery, one of the main historic emulsions used in cosmetics and in photographic film, the main coating given to medical capsule pills, and a form of food including jelly, trifle, and marshmallows; the status of gelatin in &quot;kashrut&quot; is consequently fairly controversial.

Due to the ambiguity over the source of individual items derived from gelatin, many Orthodox rabbis regard it as generally being non-kosher. However, Conservative rabbis and several prominent Orthodox rabbis—including Chaim Ozer Grodzinski and Ovadia Yosef—argue that gelatin has undergone such total chemical change and processing that it should not count as meat, and therefore would be kosher.

Technically, gelatin is produced by separating the three strands in each collagen fiber&#x27;s triple helix by boiling collagen in water. David Sheinkopf, author of &quot;Gelatin in Jewish Law&quot; (Bloch 1982) and &quot;Issues in Jewish Dietary Laws&quot; (Ktav 1998), has published in-depth studies of the kosher uses of gelatin, as well as carmine and &quot;kitniyot&quot;.

One of the main methods of avoiding non-kosher gelatin is to substitute gelatin-like materials in its place; substances with a similar chemical behaviour include food starch from tapioca, chemically modified pectins, and carrageenan combined with certain vegetable gums—guar gum, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, gum acacia, agar, and others. Although gelatin is used for several purposes by a wide variety of manufacturers, it has started to be replaced with these substitutes in a number of products, due to the use of gelatin also being a significant concern to vegans and vegetarians.

Today manufacturers are producing gelatin from the skins of kosher fish, circumventing many of these problems.

==Ritual slaughter==
One of the few dietary laws appearing in Exodus prohibits eating the meat from animals that have been &quot;torn by beasts&quot;; a related law appears in Deuteronomy, prohibiting the consumption of anything that has died from natural causes. While this law was primarily intended for the priests, it applied to all Israelites (but not &quot;strangers&quot;).

Traditional Jewish thought has expressed the view that all meat must come from animals that have been slaughtered according to Jewish law. These guidelines require the animal be killed by a single cut across the throat to a precise depth, severing both carotid arteries, both jugular veins, both vagus nerves, the trachea and the esophagus, no higher than the epiglottis and no lower than where cilia begin inside the trachea, causing the animal to bleed to death.

Some believe that this ensures the animal dies instantly without unnecessary suffering, but many animal-rights activists view the process as cruel, claiming that the animal may not lose consciousness immediately, and activists have called for it to be banned. Animal science researcher Temple Grandin has stated that kosher slaughter, no matter how well performed, does not result in an instantaneous loss of consciousness, whereas stunning properly with a captive bolt is instantaneous. She gives various times for loss of consciousness via kosher ritual slaughter, ranging from 15 to 90 seconds depending on measurement type and individual kosher slaughterhouse.

To avoid tearing, and to ensure the cut is thorough, such slaughter is usually performed by a trained individual, with a large, razor-sharp knife, which is checked before each slaughter to ensure that it has no irregularities (such as nicks and dents); if irregularities are discovered, or the cut is too shallow, the meat is deemed non-kosher.

Rabbis usually require the slaughterer, known within Judaism as a &quot;shochet&quot;, to also be a pious Jew of good character and an observer of the Shabbat. In smaller communities, the &quot;shochet&quot; was often the town rabbi, or a rabbi from a local synagogue, but large slaughterhouses usually employ a full-time &quot;shochet&quot; if they intend to sell kosher meat.

The Talmud, and later Jewish authorities, also prohibit the consumption of meat from animals who were slaughtered despite being in the process of dying from disease. This is an extension of the rules banning the meat from animals torn by beasts, and animals that die from natural causes.

To comply with this Talmudic injunction against eating diseased animals, Orthodox Jews usually require that the corpses of freshly slaughtered animals be thoroughly inspected.

There are 70 different traditional checks for irregularities and growths; for example, there are checks to ensure that the lungs have absolutely no scars, which might have been caused by an inflammation. If these checks are passed, the meat is then termed &quot;glatt&quot; (), the Yiddish word meaning &#x27;smooth&#x27;.

An unusual situation is created when a live fetus is removed from a kosher slaughtered animal. The fetus is called a &quot;ben pekuah&quot; and takes the status of the mother, so that if the mother was kosher, the fetus is kosher even if there were problems with the slaughter.

Compromises in contenence with animal-cruelty laws that prohibit such practices involve stunning the animal to lessen the suffering that occurs while the animal bleeds to death. However, the use of electric shocks to daze the animal is often not accepted by some markets as producing meat that is kosher.

===Forbidden parts of a slaughtered animal===

As forbidden fats, tendons, blood vessels and the &quot;gid hanasheh&quot; (sciatic nerve) must be removed, more difficult in the rear-quarters, often only cuts of meat from the forequarters are available.

Leviticus prohibits the eating of certain types of fat (&quot;chelev&quot;) from sacrificial land animals (cattle, sheep, and goats), since the fat is the portion of the meat exclusively allocated to God (by burning it on the altar).

====Foreleg, cheeks and maw ====
The gift of the foreleg, cheeks and maw of a kosher-slaughtered animal to a &quot;kohen&quot; is a positive commandment in the Hebrew Bible. Some rabbinic opinions maintain that consumption of the animal is forbidden before these gifts are given, though the accepted &quot;halacha&quot; is to permit this.

Furthermore, the actual foreleg, cheeks and maw of all kosher-slaughtered beef are forbidden to a non-&quot;kohen&quot; unless the &quot;kohen&quot; permits.

====Blood====
One of the main biblical food laws forbids consuming blood on account of &quot;the life [being] in the blood&quot;. This ban and reason are listed in the Noahide Laws and twice in Leviticus as well as in Deuteronomy.

Classical rabbis argued that only if it is impossible to remove every drop of blood, the prohibition against consuming blood was impractical, and there should be rare exceptions.

They claimed that consuming the blood that remained on the inside of meat (as opposed to the blood on the surface of it, dripping from it, or housed within the veins) should be permitted and that the blood of fish and locusts could also be consumed.

To comply with this prohibition, a number of preparation techniques became practiced within traditional Judaism. The main technique, known as &quot;meliḥah&quot;, involves the meat being soaked in water for about half an hour, which opens pores.

After this, the meat is placed on a slanted board or in a wicker basket, and is thickly covered with salt on each side, then left for between 20 minutes and one hour. The salt covering draws blood from the meat by osmosis, and the salt must be subsequently removed from the meat (usually by trying to shake most of it off and then washing the meat twice) to complete the extraction of the blood. The type of salt used in the process is known as kosher salt.

&quot;Meliḥah&quot; is not sufficient to extract blood from the liver, lungs, heart, and certain other internal organs, since they naturally contain a high density of blood, and therefore these organs are usually removed before the rest of the meat is salted. Roasting, on the other hand, discharges blood while cooking, and is the usual treatment given to these organs. It is also an acceptable method for removing blood from all meat.

==Food preparation by non-Jews==


Classical rabbis prohibited any item of food that had been consecrated to an idol or had been used in the service of an idol.

Since the Talmud views all non-Jews as potential idolaters, and viewed intermarriage with apprehension, it included within this prohibition any food that has been cooked or prepared completely by non-Jews. (Bread sold by a non-Jewish baker was not included in the prohibition.) Similarly, a number of Jewish writers believed food prepared for Jews by non-Jewish servants would not count as prepared by potential idolaters, although this view was opposed by Jacob ben Asher.

Consequently, Orthodox Jews generally rule that wine, certain cooked foods, and sometimes dairy products, should be prepared only by Jews.

The prohibition against drinking non-Jewish wine, traditionally called &quot;yayin nesekh&quot; (literally meaning &quot;wine for offering [to a deity]&quot;), is not absolute. Cooked wine (Hebrew: , &quot;yayin mevushal&quot;), meaning wine that has been heated, is regarded as drinkable on the basis that heated wine was not historically used as a religious libation; thus kosher wine will often be prepared by Jews and then pasteurised, after which it can be handled by a non-Jew.

Some Jews refer to these prohibited foods as &quot;akum&quot;, an acronym of &quot;Ovde Kokhavim U Mazzaloth&quot; (), meaning &quot;worshippers of stars and planets (or Zodiac)&quot;. &quot;Akum&quot; is thus a reference to activities that these Jews view as idolatry, and in many significant works of post-classical Jewish literature, such as the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, it has been applied to Christians in particular.

However, among the classical rabbis, there were a number who refused to treat Christians as idolaters, and consequently regarded food that had been manufactured by them as being kosher.

Conservative Judaism is more lenient; in the 1960s, Rabbi Silverman issued a &quot;responsum&quot;, officially approved by the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, in which he argued that wine manufactured by an automated process was not &quot;manufactured by gentiles&quot;, and therefore would be kosher.

A later &quot;responsum&quot; of Conservative Judaism was issued by Eliot Dorff, who argued, based on precedents in 15th- to 19th-century &quot;responsa&quot;, that many foods, such as wheat and oil products, which had once been forbidden when produced by non-Jews, were eventually declared kosher. On this basis he concluded wine and grape products produced by non-Jews would be permissible.

==Milk and meat==

Three times the Torah specifically forbids &quot;&quot; a young goat &quot;in its mother&#x27;s milk&quot;. The Talmud interprets this as a general prohibition against cooking meat and dairy products together, and against eating or deriving any benefit from such a mixture.

To help prevent accidental violation of these rules, the modern standard Orthodox practice is to classify food into either being &quot;fleishig&quot; (meat), &quot;milchig&quot; (dairy), or neither; this third category is more usually referred to as &quot;pareve&quot; (also spelled &quot;parve&quot; and &quot;parev&quot;) meaning &quot;neutral&quot;.

As the biblical prohibition uses the word &quot;gedi&quot; (&quot;kid&quot;) and not the phrase &quot;gedi izim&quot; (&quot;goat-kid&quot;) used elsewhere in the Torah, the rabbis concluded that the flesh of all domestic mammals (&quot;behemoth&quot;) is included in the prohibition.

Flesh of fish and bugs is not included, and therefore is considered &quot;pareve&quot;. By rabbinic decree, the flesh of birds and wild mammals (&quot;chayot&quot;), such as deer, is considered as &quot;meat&quot;, rather than &quot;pareve&quot;.

By rabbinic law and custom, not only are meat and milk not cooked together, but they are not eaten even separately within a single meal.

==Safety concerns==
===&quot;Pikuach nefesh&quot;===
The laws of &quot;kashrut&quot; can be broken for &quot;pikuach nefesh&quot; (preservation of human life). For example, a patient is allowed to eat non-kosher food if it is essential for recovery, or where the person would otherwise starve.

===Tainted food===
The Talmud adds to the biblical regulations a prohibition against consuming poisoned animals. Similarly, Yoreh De&#x27;ah prohibits the drinking of water, if the water had been left uncovered overnight in an area where there might be snakes, on the basis that a snake might have left its venom in the water. In a place where there aren&#x27;t usually snakes, this prohibition does not apply.

===Fish and meat===
The Talmud and Yoreh De&#x27;ah suggest that eating meat and fish together may cause &quot;tzaraath&quot;. Strictly Orthodox Jews thus avoid combining the two, while Conservative Jews may or may not.

==Kosherfest==
Each year, 5,000 food industry vendors, kosher certification agencies, journalists and other professionals gathered in New York City to sample kosher fare from 300 event attendees, at an expo billed KosherFest.

The expo closed after 2022, but was replaced by another event called Kosher-Palooza.

<text>Eugene Wilder Chafin (November 1, 1852 – November 30, 1920) was an American politician and writer who served as the Prohibition Party&#x27;s presidential candidate during the 1908 and 1912 presidential elections. He was active in local politics in Wisconsin, statewide elections in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Arizona, and campaigned throughout the United States and the world in favor of the prohibition of alcohol.

After serving as a delegate to multiple Prohibition national conventions he rose to serving on the national committee and then received the presidential nomination twice, but declined to seek the nomination again for the 1916 presidential election.

==Early life==
Eugene Wilder Chafin was born on November 1, 1852, to Samuel Evans Chafin and Betsy Almira Pollard, on his family&#x27;s farm in between East Troy and Mukwonago, Wisconsin. Chafin attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison and graduated on June 17, 1875, with a law degree and during his education shared a room with future Governor, Senator, and presidential candidate Robert M. La Follette. From 1875 to 1901 he practiced law in Waukesha, Wisconsin. On November 24, 1881, he married Carrie Arvila Hunkins and later had two children with her, one that died after birth on February 22, 1884 and Desdemona Eleanor on March 17, 1893.

On October 1, 1901, he moved to Chicago to become the superintendent of the city&#x27;s Washingtonian home, which housed 1,500 alcoholics, and served in that position until 1904. From 1904 to 1908 he served as a lecturer as part of the Chautauqua movement. In 1909, he was admitted to practice law before the Supreme Court of the United States after being presented by Senator La Follette and with Carrie Nation in attendance.

==Career==
===Local politics===

In 1881, he left the Republican Party and joined the Prohibition Party and in the same year ran for District Attorney in Waukesha county. From 1884 to 1920, he served as a delegate to the Prohibition national conventions, from 1888 to 1896 he served as a national committeeman from Wisconsin and again for Arizona and California from 1912 to 1920, at the 1884 convention he served as the Sergeant-at-Arms and gave one of the seconding speechings for John St. John, and in 1900 he served on the platform committee.

In 1877, he was elected as the Justice of the Peace in Waukesha and served until 1883 and then served as Police Justice until 1885. He later served on the school and public library board. Chafin ran for the House of Representatives in Wisconsin in 1882 and in Illinois in 1902. In 1886 and 1900, he ran for attorney general in Wisconsin and later ran for attorney general in Illinois in 1904. In 1898, he ran for Governor of Wisconsin.

===Presidential===
====1908====

On July 16, 1908, Chafin was nominated by A. G. Wolfenbarger and Chafin won the Prohibition presidential nomination on the third ballot with 636 delegates voting for him against William B. Palmore, Daniel R. Sheen, Alfred L. Manierre, Will W. Tracy, Frederick F. Wheeler, James B. Cranfill, and Oliver W. Stewart. The vice presidential nomination was offered to Palmore due to him receiving the second highest amount of support, but he declined and the position was instead given to Aaron S. Watkins. While running for president he was also simultaneously running for the Prohibition gubernatorial nomination in Illinois, but was defeated in the primary by Daniel R. Sheen.

In August, he was swimming at the YMCA in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he almost drowned, but was rescued by three people. On August 14, 1908, he was giving a speech in Springfield, Illinois, when a lynch mob started a race riot in an attempt to kill three black prisoners and while he was taking his handkerchief out from his pocket a member of the mob believed that he was pulling a gun out and threw a brick at him. In the general election he received 254,087 votes for 1.71% of the total popular vote.

====1912====

Chafin started his second presidential campaign on January 5, 1912, in Tucson, Arizona, and then traveled east towards Atlantic City, New Jersey, where on July 12, 1912, he won the Prohibition presidential nomination on the first ballot with 594 delegates after having his name presented by F. J. Sibley and Watkins was selected as his vice president again after two ballots. After winning the nomination he traveled towards the western United States and campaigned in all of the states along the Pacific Coast before the general election. During the campaign he traveled a total of 36,300 miles through thirty states and received 208,156 votes for 1.38% of the popular vote in the general election.

====1916====

In December 1915, he stated that he would not seek the Prohibition presidential nomination again for the 1916 presidential election and that he believed that Representative Richmond P. Hobson would receive the nomination. He also gave his support to Henry Ford&#x27;s Peace Ship and that he would put forward a vote to add abolishing the War and Navy Departments and establishing a Department of Peace at the 1916 National Prohibition Convention.

Chafin attempted to draft Henry Ford for the Prohibition presidential nomination, but he made no attempt. At the national convention he put forward former New York Governor William Sulzer for the presidential nomination, but he was defeated by former Indiana Governor Frank Hanly with 440 delegates to 188 delegates on July 21, 1916. An attempt was made to make Hanly&#x27;s nomination unanimous, but it failed after Chafin objected. He also objected and stopped efforts to rename the party to either the Progressive, American, or National party and criticized Virgil G. Hinshaw for writing to John M. Parker in an attempt to fuse the Prohibition and Progressive parties. In the general election, Hanly and Ira Landrith received 221,302 votes for 1.19% of the popular vote.

==Later life==

In 1908, Chafin was appointed to the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States and in October 1909, he and his family moved to Tucson in the Arizona Territory. Following Arizona&#x27;s admission into the United States as a state he ran in the House special election and received 0.41% in fourth place.

In January 1913, he started a campaign in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to fundraise $1,000,000 for the Prohibition party to use during the 1916 elections and later participated in a fundraising event in November across Ohio to raise $10,000 for the party.

On January 29, 1914, he announced that he would run in Arizona&#x27;s Senate election and received 15.05% in the general election and from 1914 to 1915 gave lectures as part of the Flying Squadron of America. Chafin also campaigned in favor of a California ballot proposition to prohibit alcohol in 1914 and during it stated that women who voted against it deserved to be beaten by their husbands.

On January 6, 1919, Chafin and his family boarded the S.S. &quot;Sonoma&quot; to travel to Australia to help the Australian prohibition movement. The Eighteenth Amendment banning alcohol was ratified while he was traveling on January 16, 1919, and he was interviewed after disembarking in Australia.

On November 20, 1920, Chafin was lighting his gas heater at his home in Long Beach, California, in the Los Angeles area, and his clothing caught fire. He suffered burns and was initially saved by Henry Murray who wrapped him in quilts, but he died from his injuries on November 30. In 1921, his cremated remains were buried in Prairie Home Cemetery in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and the National Prohibition Committee had a memorial hour for Chafin at its November 1921 session.

<doc id="1260799" wikidata="Q2365017" url="?curid=1260799" title="Aldaric acid">
<text>Aldaric acids are a group of sugar acids, where the terminal hydroxyl and carbonyl groups of the sugars have been replaced by terminal carboxylic acids, and are characterised by the formula HO2C-(CHOH)n-CO2H. Oxidation of just the aldehyde yields an aldonic acid while oxidation of just the terminal hydroxyl group yields an uronic acid.) Aldaric acids cannot form cyclic hemiacetals like unoxidized sugars, but they can sometimes form lactones.
==Synthesis and reactions==
Aldaric acids are usually synthesized by the oxidation of aldoses with nitric acid. In this reaction it is the open-chain (polyhydroxyaldehyde) form of the sugar that reacts. These compounds are of interest as bio-derived chemicals including to bio-derived polyesters.

==Structure==
Nomenclature of the aldaric acids is based on the sugars from which they are derived; for example, glucose is oxidized to glucaric acid and xylose to xylaric acid. 

Unlike their parent sugars, aldaric acids have the same functional group at both ends of their carbon chain; therefore, two different sugars can yield the same aldaric acid (this can be understood by looking at the Fischer projection of a sugar upside down—with normal aldoses, this is a different compound due to the aldehyde function at the top and the hydroxyl function at the bottom, but with aldaric acids, there is a carboxylic acid function on both ends, so upside down and right side up do not matter). For example, -glucaric acid and -gularic acid are the same compound (but the first name is preferred, because of - prefix). A consequence of this is that some aldaric acids are meso forms with no optical activity despite their multiple chiral centers—this occurs if a sugar and its enantiomer oxidize to the same aldaric acid. An example is -galactose—it has four chiral centers, but -galactaric and -galactaric acids, which have the opposite configuration at each chiral center and therefore would be expected to be enantiomers, are actually the same compound; therefore, galactaric acid is an achiral meso form with no optical activity. Again, this can be understood by taking the Fischer projection of either acid and looking at it upside down—the configuration is now switched at every carbon.

Adipic acid, HO2C(CH2)4COOH, is not an aldaric acid, but a simple dicarboxylic acid.

<doc id="1260808" wikidata="Q7307130" url="?curid=1260808" title="Reference question">
<text>In Canadian law, a reference question or reference case (formally called abstract review) is a submission by the federal or a provincial government to the courts asking for an advisory opinion on a major legal issue. Typically the question concerns the constitutionality of legislation.

==Constitutional and statutory authority==
===Reference jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada===

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, gives the federal Parliament the power to create a &quot;General Court of Appeal for Canada&quot;, but does not define the jurisdiction of the Court. When Parliament created the Supreme Court of Canada in 1875, it gave the federal Cabinet the power to refer questions to the Supreme Court for the Court&#x27;s opinion. That provision has been carried forward and is now found in the current &quot;Supreme Court Act&quot;.

Under that provision, the federal Cabinet may submit a question to the Supreme Court of Canada by means of an order-in-council. Once the questions have been submitted to the Court, the Court has complete control over the process to be followed. The reference is treated in the same way as an appeal. The Attorney General of Canada is entitled to appear before the Court and to make submissions. The Attorneys General of the provinces and territories are entitled to notice of a reference and may appear on it. Interested parties are able to apply for intervener status to make submissions during the hearing. When necessary, the Court may appoint an to submit a factum to support a particular view.

Once the parties have been determined, the Court sets out a timetable for the filing of written submissions, and for the date of the hearing. Parties to the reference file detailed written submissions on the legal issues raised by the reference, supplemented by factual records if necessary. After all written submissions have been filed, the Court holds an oral hearing on the reference questions. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court typically reserves its decision. At a later date, the Court releases its opinion on the reference, in the form of a detailed written judgment. Individual judges of the Court are entitled to dissent from the majority opinion, in the same way as with judgments in appeals.

The opinion given by the Supreme Court is in the form of a judicial decision but is not legally binding; nevertheless, no government has ever ignored the opinion.

Prior to 1949, there was an appeal from the Supreme Court to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, sitting in London. The Judicial Committee served as the highest court for the British Empire and Commonwealth. Many federal reference questions were appealed to the Judicial Committee, which had the final say and could overrule the decision of the Supreme Court.

===Reference jurisdiction of the provincial courts===
The provincial governments, under their respective &quot;Constitutional Questions Acts&quot;, are able to submit questions to the provincial Superior Court or Court of Appeal. The process is very similar to the federal government reference questions. Once the provincial Court of Appeal has given its decision on the reference question, the government or other parties to the reference have the right under the &quot;Supreme Court Act&quot; to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Prior to 1949, appeals lay directly from the provincial courts of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. This right of direct appeal allowed litigants to by-pass the Supreme Court, so many provincial reference cases were never heard by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court was then required to follow the decision of the Judicial Committee.

==Constitutionality of the reference jurisdiction==
There have been challenges to the power of the federal government to confer the reference jurisdiction on the Supreme Court, but these challenges have been rejected, most recently in the Reference re Secession of Quebec in 1998.

Pursuant to the ruling of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in &quot;Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General of Canada (References Reference)&quot; [1912] A.C. 571, the role of the courts in references is not judicial as such, but one of advising the executive branch of government.

== Federal reference questions ==
There have been over 75 federal references to the Supreme Court since 1892. Prior to the abolition of appeals to the Judicial Committee, many of the earlier federal references went on appeal from the Supreme Court to the Judicial Committee. Since the abolition of appeals, the Supreme Court decision is the final say on a federal reference.

== Provincial reference questions ==
The provincial governments have the power to refer legal issues to their courts as well. Prior to the abolition of appeals to the Judicial Committee, those reference questions could be appealed directly to the Judicial Committee, by-passing the Supreme Court. Since the abolition of appeals to the Judicial Committee, there is a right of appeal from the provincial courts to the Supreme Court on a provincial reference.

==Imperial reference questions relating to Canada==
* Labrador Boundary Reference, [1927 UKPC 25]

==Reference jurisdiction in other countries==

The government of the United Kingdom has the power to refer questions to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. This power served as one of the inspirations for the reference power under the Supreme Court Act. There has been one reference directly under this power to the Judicial Committee which related to Canada, concerning the Labrador boundary dispute between Canada and Newfoundland, which at that time was an independent dominion, not part of Canada. Other Commonwealth countries, such as India, South Africa, and Papua New Guinea also have implemented a reference jurisdiction in their constitutions. In the case of Papua New Guinea, their constitutional convention immediately prior to independence took counsel from Canadian legal academics on the use of the reference jurisdiction.

Other jurisdictions, notably Australia and the United States, eschew reference jurisdiction for their courts. In the United States, the case or controversy clause of Article III of the United States Constitution limits federal courts to hear only actual cases; advisory opinions are not permitted at the federal level (although some state constitutions do provide for such opinions). Likewise, the Australian Constitution has a similar requirement in Chapter III of the Constitution.

<doc id="1260815" wikidata="Q809003" url="?curid=1260815" title="Barry Adamson">
<text>Barry Adamson (born 11 June 1958) is an English pop and rock musician, composer, writer, photographer and filmmaker. He came to prominence in the late 1970s as a member of the post-punk band Magazine and went on to work with Visage, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and the electro musicians Pan Sonic. In addition to prolific solo work, Adamson has also remixed Grinderman, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Recoil and Depeche Mode. He also worked on the soundtrack for David Lynch&#x27;s surrealistic crime film &quot;Lost Highway&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Adamson was born in Moss Side, Manchester, England to a white mother and a black father. He read comic books from an early age. At school he immersed himself in art, music and film and produced his first song – &quot;Brain Pain&quot; – at the age of 10. His diverse musical tastes range from Alice Cooper to Motown to David Bowie.

===Career===
After leaving school, Adamson drifted into graphic design whilst attending Stockport Art College but quit shortly after, preferring to venture into the exploding punk rock scene of the late 1970s. He joined ex-Buzzcocks singer Howard Devoto&#x27;s band Magazine to play the bass guitar, with whom he scored one chart single, &quot;Shot by Both Sides&quot;; in late 1977, he joined the Buzzcocks, as a temporary replacement for Garth Smith. He played on all of Magazine&#x27;s albums in their original incarnation and contributed to Devoto&#x27;s solo album and his next band, Luxuria. He also contributed to the studio-based band Visage, playing on the ensemble&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Visage&quot; and &quot;The Anvil&quot;.

After Magazine broke up, Adamson worked with another ex-Buzzcock, Pete Shelley, before joining Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, featuring on four of their albums: &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot;, &quot;The Firstborn Is Dead&quot;, &quot;Kicking Against the Pricks&quot; and &quot;Your Funeral, My Trial&quot;. After his stint with the band and a European tour with Iggy Pop in 1987, he went solo, releasing an EP, &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; in 1988, and his first solo album, &quot;Moss Side Story&quot;, the following year, the &quot;soundtrack&quot; to a non-existent film noir. The album incorporated newscasts and sampled sound effects and featured guest musicians Marcia Schofield (of The Fall), Diamanda Galas, and former colleagues from the Bad Seeds. Adamson&#x27;s second solo album was the soundtrack to a real film this time – Carl Colpaert&#x27;s &quot;Delusion&quot;, and he would go on to provide soundtracks for several other films.

Adamson&#x27;s third album, &quot;Soul Murder&quot;, was shortlisted for the Mercury Music Prize in 1992.

His solo work has mostly been influenced by John Barry, Elmer Bernstein and Ennio Morricone, whilst his later works include jazz, electronica, soul, funk, and dub-styles.

In 1996, Adamson contributed to the AIDS-Benefit Album, &quot;&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization. His own album that year, &quot;Oedipus Schmoedipus&quot;, reached #51 in the UK Albums Chart. It would later be included in the &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die &quot;list, along with &quot;Moss Side Story&quot;.

In 2002, Adamson left his long-term label, Mute Records, and started his own production home, Central Control International. In 2006, he released &quot;Stranger on the Sofa&quot;, first for his Central Control International imprint, to critical acclaim. &quot;Back to the Cat&quot;, his second album for the label, was released in March 2008.

In 2007 it was announced that Magazine would re-form for concerts in 2008. Adamson took part in the same band line-up that recorded &quot;Secondhand Daylight&quot;, with the exception of the late John McGeoch, who was replaced by Apollo 440 member Noko. However, Adamson has since withdrawn from the reunion and new recordings.

On 27 August 2010, Adamson released the track &quot;Rag and Bone&quot;, as a digital download and as a 12-inch vinyl record.

In 2011, Adamson premiered his directorial debut, &quot;Therapist&quot;, for which he also provided the music. He then released a studio album, &quot;I Will Set You Free&quot;, on 30 January 2012.

Adamson collaborated with the Bad Seeds on their 2013 album, &quot;Push the Sky Away&quot;, playing bass guitar on two songs. He also toured with the band on drums and keyboards, to fill in for an ailing Thomas Wydler.

His 2016 album &quot;Know Where To Run&quot; was accompanied by a book with photos that Adamson shot in the US while on tour with Nick Cave. 2018 saw the release of &quot;Memento Mori&quot;, an album celebrating his 40th anniversary as a professional musician, which was followed by a concert at the Union Chapel in London. A recording of this concert was released on vinyl and CD.

====Soundtrack material====
Adamson&#x27;s &quot;Refugee Song&quot; was included in Derek Jarman&#x27;s &quot;The Last of England&quot; soundtrack. He composed the soundtrack to &quot;Delusion&quot;, which has also been released. Adamson also contributed soundtrack material to &quot;Gas Food Lodging&quot; and David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot;.

==Instruments==
In the earliest &quot;Real Life Magazine&quot; videos, Adamson played a Rickenbacker 4001, and on &quot;Secondhand Daylight&quot;, a Gibson EB-3. His primary bass during Magazine&#x27;s touring was an Ovation Magnum Mk1. The Ovation can be seen in Magazine&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Urgh! A Music War&quot; as well as on the cover of the live album &quot;Play&quot;. For the 2008 Magazine concerts, he alternated between the Ovation, a Fender Artist and a Fender Jaguar Bass. He often used a Boss Chorus unit on his basses, giving a slightly processed sound that was much imitated in the UK 1980s rock scene.

==Legacy==
In his autobiography, &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy (And Other Lies)&quot;, Duff McKagan of Guns N&#x27; Roses said he was influenced by bass-driven bands such as that of Barry Adamson in Magazine. In an interview with German music magazine Gitarre &amp; Bass, Billy Gould of Faith No More said that Adamson was one of his influences, because he combined soul music with post-punk when he played with Magazine.

<text>Mirmo! Zibang, known in Japan as , is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiromu Shinozuka. It was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Ciao&quot; from August 2001 to December 2005, with its chapters collected in twelve volumes. Chuang Yi released the manga in English in Singapore.

A 172-episode anime television series adaptation, known in Japan as &quot;Wagamama Fairy: Mirumo de Pon!&quot; and produced by Studio Hibari, was broadcast on TV Tokyo from April 2002 to September 2005. It was licensed in North America by Viz Media.

The manga series was awarded in the 2003 Kodansha Manga Award and in the 2004 Shogakukan Manga Award for children&#x27;s manga.

==Plot==

; Season 1
The fairy protagonist is a love fairy named Mirmo (Mirumo in the Japanese version). Katie Minami (Kaede Minami in the Japanese version) is the human protagonist and a cheerful and energetic eighth-grader who is shy around her male classmates, which makes it difficult for her to date. One day, on her way home from school, she walks into a mysterious shop and buys a blue cocoa mug. When she arrives at home, she peeks into the bottom of the mug and discovers an engraved note which says, &quot;If you read this message aloud while pouring hot cocoa into the mug, a love fairy (&quot;muglox&quot;) will appear and grant your every wish.&quot; The skeptical but curious Kaede follows the directions and announces her wish to date Dylan Yuki (Setsu Yuuki in the Japanese version), her crush. Mirmo arrives. At first, she is afraid of him but later understands that he is a muglox. Kaede soon finds out that Mirmo prefers eating chocolate and creating mischief over helping Katie.

Mirumo is a prince of the muglox world. Horrified at the prospect of having to marry Rima (Rirumu in the Japanese version), his princess bride-to-be, Mirmo escaped the muglox world. Hot on his heels, however, are Rima, Yatch (Yashichi in the Japanese version) the bounty hunter, Mulu (Murumo; Mirmo&#x27;s brother), and many other muglox as well. The villains of the first season are the Warumo gang, a gang of criminals who plan to overthrow the Marumo kingdom. Though they are villains, they actually aren&#x27;t evil; they just pull childish pranks and faint after hearing an evil plan. At the end of the season, Akumi gives Warumo Gang a time sphere, which they play around with and accidentally smash, causing the muglox world to freeze. Mirmo, Mulu, Rima, Yatch and their partners save the muglox world by having the fairies dance in front of a magical door (which allows it to open) and having the partners find the magic time bird which flew into the door to escape being captured by them.

; Season 2
In this season, a new transfer student named Saori comes to Katie&#x27;s school. The villain Darkman, created by the darkness in human hearts, tries to resurrect himself. He influences the minds of Akumi and the Warumo gang. Session magic is introduced for two-person magic, with each person combo producing different magic. Darkman controls Saori and uses her flute to control peoples&#x27; emotions. He is then defeated by Golden Mirmo, the outcome of three person session magic. With the help of Nezumi/Rato, he is resurrected until the muglox&#x27;s four-person session magic gives Saori the power to defeat Darkman. The two worlds are separated until reunited by the muglox and their partners&#x27; friendship. Saori goes to Germany to study music with Akumi as her new partner.

; Season 3
In this season, a robot octopus, Tako, convinces the gang to look for the legendary seven crystals which are drawn out by different emotions. After all are collected, the gang faces seven trials. Mirmo must pass these tests for the crystals to unite and form a pendant. Tako steals it to save his girlfriend and his land. In the end, they succeed and Tako becomes king of crystal land.

; Season 4
Two new characters, Koichi and Haruka, are introduced. Koichi has a crush on Katie, and Haruka is Setsu&#x27;s childhood friend who wants to be a cartoonist. Her partner Panta is a ghost muglox. Thanks to Azumi, Katie and Koichi kiss. Also, Koichi confessed to Katie after Katie had a whole day of helping him confess to his crush that she didn&#x27;t know was her. Setsu starts to fall in love with Katie, and Koichi realizes that he is not right for Kaede and gives up on her. After Haruka tells Dylan she loves him, he chooses her over Katie. Haruka realizes Dylan&#x27;s true love is Katie and gives up on him. Dylan tells Katie he loves her and they become a couple; Katie&#x27;s wish is fulfilled. Mirmo has to leave in one hour or something terrible will happen, which the Warumo gang make so. Mirmo loses all memories of Katie and turns into a rabbit. Katie brings his memories back and he turns back to normal.

<text>The president of Kosovo (; ), officially the president of the Republic of Kosovo (; ), is the head of state of the Kosovo. The president is elected indirectly, by the parliament, in a secret ballot by a two-thirds majority of deputies in functions. If no candidate achieves a two-thirds majority, at the third ballot the candidate who receives a simple majority is elected. The vote in the parliament should take place no later than a month before the end of the incumbent president&#x27;s term of office. The president serves for a five-year term, renewable once.

==History==
The first post-war president, who served until his death in January 2006, was Ibrahim Rugova. His successor was Fatmir Sejdiu. When Sejdiu resigned from his post on 27 September 2010, Jakup Krasniqi served as acting president. On 22 February 2011, Behgjet Pacolli was elected as a president of Kosovo, which was quickly evaluated as an unconstitutional move. On 4 April 2011, Behgjet Pacolli stepped down and it was decided that another candidate would be elected to serve for up to a year. A constitutional reform will be undertaken to allow for a popular vote for the president in 2013. On 7 April 2011, Atifete Jahjaga, Deputy Director of the Kosovo Police, with the rank of major general,&lt;ref name=&quot;election/rank&quot;&gt;&quot;Atifete Jahjaga zgjidhet presidente e Republikës&quot; &quot;Telegrafi.com&quot; 7 April 2011 (accessed 6 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; was elected as president.

<text>Simon Gjoni (Shkodër, 1925–1991) was an Albanian conductor, and composer of many popular pieces for piano and orchestra.

==Life==
Simon Gjoni was born on October 28, 1923, in the city of Shkodër, Albania. He was educated in a rank and file urban family and graduated from the &quot;Illyricum&quot; High School of the city. Very soon he learned to play guitar, trombone, the piano and devoted himself with enthusiasm and passion to the art of music. In the years of his youth, he composed over 200 original songs, which were immediately sung in the city of Shkodër and were spread all over Albania, such as &quot;Lule Bore&quot; (Snowflower), &quot;Syte e tu si drite&quot; (English: Your Eyes Like Light), &quot;Weaving girl&quot;. Ispecially the song &quot;Lulebore&quot; became really famous in Albania with a continuous success for over 60 years and is the first albanian song to achieve international success after it was performed in Russia, China, Vietnam,Chekoslovakia, Italy, USA etc. 

He completed his studies over the years 1952–1958 in the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (Czechoslovakia). During the years 1956-1958 in the city of Prague, he conducted: Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Rosamunde&quot;, Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, Jiří Antonín Benda&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, K. Dittersdorff &quot;Concert symphony for violin and contrabass&quot;, and Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Les Preludes&quot;.

In 1958 he returned to Tirana, where he started teaching at the Artistic Lyceum of Tirana and later in 1961 was among the first lecturers in Conservatory of Music in Tirana - Albania (today University of Arts), where he prepared many generations of musicians and artists, teaching the subjects of polyphony, orchestration, conducting, intonation and chamber music. In 1958, while being a teacher, he also worked for the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania, where he conducted many worldwide renowned works, which were interpreted for the first time in Albania. Such works were: Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s Don Pasquale, Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s Pagliacci, Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s Barber of Seville, Tish Daija&#x27;s &quot;Pranvera&quot; (), and two ballets (by Sergei Vasilenko&#x27;s &quot;Lola&quot;, and Alexander Krein&#x27;s Laurencia). Under his care and passion, he recorded many works of the Albanian composers: such as Çesk Zadeja, Pjetër Gaci, Nova, Tish Daija, Tonin Harapi, Pjetër Dungu, Grimci, Kono etc., and the music of some Albanian movies. In 1967, he conducted in China works by Albanian composers. Gjoni was also one of the founders of the Symphonic Orchestra of the Albanian Radio-Television. He worked persistently and with discipline for the establishment and growth of that orchestra.

Gjoni&#x27;s activity as a composer has passed through all genres from the song, romance, cantata, suite, ballads, works for piano, clarinet, violin and major orchestral works such as: Symphonic dances, Symphonic poems, Symphonic Suite up to Symphony in Mib. Gjoni was a composer with a noble inspiration and pathos, whose music flows freely. Critic of music and musicologist George Leotsakos, in his letter dated 22 December 1991 characterized him as follows: &quot;Simon Gjoni was an excellent composer, a predestined creator, with a profound aesthetic and musical culture, but above all with a marvelous human personality, with a golden heart in harmony with his refined culture.&quot;

Likewise, in the field of musical critique, he has left numerous theoretical works, related to the Albanian musical art and his work &quot;The Instruments and the Art of Orchestration&quot;.

Composer Çesk Zadeja wrote the following on Gjoni on Drita, an Albanian cultural periodical, dated 1 December 1991, right after Gjoni&#x27;s death:
The name of Simon Gjoni will remain ingraved in the pentagram of the Albanian music. The highest assessment for each creator is then when his work (his message) has its repercussion in the profundity of the time, increasing its values along as the time passes by. These features are attributed to the talented artist, composer, conductor, lecturer and musicologist Simon Gjoni.

<doc id="1260831" wikidata="Q7240478" url="?curid=1260831" title="Premium fare">
<text>A premium fare is a fare on a public transport service set at least ten percent above the fare normally applying on that route or offered by alternative service - companies or public bodies often using a slower or less commodious vehicle. A premium fare might be levied at times where traffic-levels would otherwise be unbearably high, for instance on summer Fridays or during rush hours, or on a clearly identifiable route where a timely arrival is perceived as particularly important (e.g. reaching a ferry terminal or airport for an onward link for which a high price has already been paid). If the fare level deters some passengers this might reduce vandalism and maintenance costs and minimise the dwell-time required at any intermediate stops between the most popular stops. Many premium fare operations are non-stop (light) railway links and they can therefore abstract considerable capacity from any railway line also used by slower (normally less glamorous) services.

Along congested transport corridors or inner suburbs with lower car ownership levels and typically lower traffic speeds, the adverse impact of fast trains upon other passenger train timetables or parking opportunities raises issues of social equity. Political parties differ widely on whether public transport operations should meet their costs or be viewed partly as a welfare service supporting broader aims of balancing development, life-chances and job opportunities across a city region. Premium fares can thus be viewed as socially divisive, although when applied only to short periods of a working-day they can improve levels of safety and comfort through enticing travellers to spread their journey times. That might have multiplier benefits on personal stress, crime levels and pollution incidence if managed with sensitivity to the public good (rather than simply in pursuance of an operator&#x27;s profit motive).

Emphasizing the benefits of an off-peak zonal rover ticket at a lower fare than peak-period options over an identical route is one well-tried way of making premium peak-hour fares seem more acceptable, it is an instance of a clever marketing slant. Road tolls as introduced on turnpikes can also be varied by time of day, day of week, or season with identical motives. These can also be market-led or community-determined and might be accrued to repay loans secured by a firm or transport agency to enable the construction of a bridge, tunnel or high-grade section of road. Again the higher priced option has to be demonstrably better than any alternative route that can be freely driven (excluding running costs of the vehicle).

Wherever a fare is deliberately pitched lower than the norm, this is termed predatory pricing and can lead to antitrust action where regulators have some authority. It is a tactic used to achieve a more monopolistic position in a local &#x27;marketplace&#x27;, in plain language to squeeze-out an upstart operator, or possibly a well-established one perceived as rather complacent or vulnerable for other reasons (such as poorly remunerated staff).

<text>Sergey Voychenko (, &quot;Siarhiej Vojchanka&quot;; ) (15 November 1955 – 9 December 2004) was a Belarusian artist and designer known for his creative posters and photography art work together with his partner Vladimir Tsesler.

Sergey Voychenko was born in Mariupol, Ukraine but his family moved to Minsk, Belarus (where his family roots were) when he was four years old. In 1969 he enrolled in an art school where he studied art and sculpture, and in 1975 got accepted to the Belarusian Art Academy, the department of design, where he met his future co-author Vladimir Tsesler. He got his first award for posters in 1984 for a series of posters called &quot;History of Minsk.&quot;

Voychenko and Tsesler exhibited at the State Russian Museum in 2000.

In autumn 2004, Voychenko had a heart bypass surgery, but died only two months later. One month before his death, Voychenko and Tsesler had another exhibition on Montmartre in Paris.

<text>Judy Rebick (born August 15, 1945) is a Canadian writer, journalist, political activist, and feminist.

==Early life==
Born in Reno, Nevada, Rebick and her family moved to Toronto when she was 9. She became a socialist activist in the 1970s, joining the Revolutionary Marxist Group. She was a member of its successor, the Revolutionary Workers League, and wrote articles for the RWL&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Socialist Voice&quot;, until she left the organization in the early 1980s.

==Career==

=== 1980s ===
Rebick first gained prominence in her role as spokesperson for the Ontario Coalition for Abortion Clinics, a pro-choice group, in the 1980s.

In 1983, when a man attacked Henry Morgentaler with garden shears outside of his Toronto abortion clinic, Rebick blocked the attack, and Morgentaler escaped unharmed. Augusto Dantas was charged with assault and with possession of a weapon dangerous to the public good.

She became active in the mid-1980s with an internal group within the Ontario New Democratic Party called the &quot;Campaign for an Activist Party&quot;. Though the CAP generated a significant degree of grassroot support, it was opposed by the party establishment, including party leader Bob Rae, and failed. Rebick lost her bid to become party president, losing to Gillian Sandeman, 818 votes to 361. In the 1987 provincial election, she was the NDP&#x27;s candidate in the suburban Toronto riding of Oriole, where she placed third with 16.7% of the vote, losing to the incumbent, Liberal cabinet minister Elinor Caplan.

Rebick also worked for The Canadian Hearing Society during the 1970s and 1980s as special projects director.

=== 1990s ===
Rebick became a nationally known figure as president of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women from 1990 to 1993. She was the co-host of a prime time debate show called &quot;Face Off&quot; on CBC Newsworld from 1994–1998 and then a women&#x27;s discussion show &quot;Straight From the Hip&quot;, until 2000. She was a regular commentator on CBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Report&quot; and CBC Radio. She was during that time also a columnist with &quot;Elm Street&quot;, the &quot;London Free Press&quot;, and on CBC Online.

=== 2000s ===
With Jim Stanford, Svend Robinson and Libby Davies, she helped lead the New Politics Initiative, a movement that worked both inside and outside the New Democratic Party to refocus it as an activist party. The NPI&#x27;s platform was rejected at the 2001 NDP convention in Winnipeg. She initiated the wind down of the NPI in 2003, claiming that many of its ideals had been embraced by new party leader Jack Layton.

In 2005, she published &quot;Ten Thousand Roses: The Making of a Feminist Revolution&quot;, which covers feminists movements in Canada from the 1960s through the 1990s. She also published &quot;Transforming Power: From the Personal to the Political&quot; (2009). From 2002 to 2011 she served three consecutive terms as the Canadian Auto Workers–Sam Gindin Chair in Social Justice and Democracy at Ryerson University (now Toronto Metropolitan University) in Toronto, Ontario.

Rebick, who is Jewish, took part in protests against the State of Israel&#x27;s military actions in the 2009 Gaza conflict.

=== 2010–present ===

After the conclusion of the G20 summit in Toronto in June 2010, Rebick suggested that police did not adequately address the problem of Black Bloc protestors who caused property damage, stating at the time, &quot;What they could have done is arrest the Black Bloc at the beginning before they had a chance to be part of the bigger crowd, and that&#x27;s what they didn&#x27;t do.&quot;

Rebick began visiting Occupy camps starting with Zuccotti Park in New York on October 16, 2011, after the movement had exploded in growth overnight and camps had been established in cities throughout the US and Canada. She began promoting the Occupy movement, and in March 2012 her book &quot;Occupy This&quot; was released by Penguin Canada.

Her memoir, &quot;Heroes in My Head&quot;, was released in 2018. The book formed part of the basis for Mike Hoolboom&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Judy Versus Capitalism&quot;, which was released in 2020.

In March 2022, she was amongst 151 international feminists signing &quot;Feminist Resistance Against War: A Manifesto&quot;, in solidarity with the Russian Feminist Anti-War Resistance.

<text>John Pierce St. John (February 25, 1833 - August 31, 1916) was an American politician who served as the eighth governor of Kansas and later served as the Prohibition presidential nominee in 1884. Under his tenure as governor Kansas became the third state to enact a statewide prohibition of alcohol which would last until 1948 and remain in some form until 1987. After leaving elected office he maintained his position in the Prohibition party and remained active in the party&#x27;s presidential politics and was a major figure in the party schism during the 1896 presidential election.

==Early life==

On February 25, 1833, John Pierce St. John was born in Brookville, Indiana, to Samuel St. John and Sophia Snell. In 1852, he became the conductor of an ox team which he led to California. During his time in California he fought against the Modoc Native Americans in California and Oregon. John was a congregationalist until the 1870s when he converted and became a Christian Scientist. From 1852 to 1859, he was married to Mary Jane Brewer and had one son until their divorce. On March 28, 1860, he married Susan J. Parker and later had two children with her.

==Career==

During the American Civil War he served as lieutenant colonel of the 143rd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment in the Union Army from 1861 to 1864. At the end of the war he lived in Independence, Missouri until 1869 when he moved to Olathe, Kansas. From 1873 to 1874 he served in the Kansas Senate and was the Republican governor of Kansas from 1879 to 1883.

He was the first governor of Kansas to have a formal inauguration ceremony. He was active in the temperance movement and successfully promoted a prohibition amendment to the state&#x27;s constitution in 1881. St. John also helped create the Kansas Freedmen&#x27;s Relief Association during the Great Exodus of African-Americans to Kansas in 1879. In 1879, the religious colony of Zion Valley was renamed to St. John in his honor to gain favor in winning the county seat of Stafford County. In 1882, he ran for reelection to a third term, but was defeated by George Washington Glick with 83,232 votes to 75,158 votes.

===Presidential===

He was the Prohibition Party candidate for President of the United States in the 1884 election. On October 2, 1884, he was nearly shot, with the bullet hitting the window next to him. He received 147,482 votes for 1.5% of the popular vote on a ticket with William Daniel which was an increase of 137,118 votes from Neal Dow&#x27;s results in 1880 due to support from Frances Willard and the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. He was blamed for James G. Blaine&#x27;s defeat and on November 27, 1884, an effigy of him was burned in Topeka, Kansas in front of a crowd of three thousand people.

He was made chairman of the 1888 Prohibition national convention and oversaw the writing of the party&#x27;s platform. He declined to seek the Prohibition Party&#x27;s presidential nomination for the 1892 presidential election and instead nominated John Bidwell who went on to win the nomination and was named as the temporary chairman of the convention. At the 1896 Prohibition convention he supported the broad gauger faction that wanted to add women&#x27;s suffrage and free silver to the party&#x27;s platform, but after the narrow gauger faction successfully defeated those attempts John, Charles Eugene Bentley, and Helen M. Gougar led a walkout of the broad gaugers and created the breakaway National Party and nominated a rival ticket with Bentley as president and James H. Southgate as vice president. Following the 1896 election he became disillusioned with party and joined the People&#x27;s Party although he would later return to the Prohibition party.

==Later life==

On December 3, 1887, he, with a group of followers, bought 10,000 acres of land in Newhall, California, to create a dry community. In 1912, he toured Kansas in support of women&#x27;s suffrage. On June 20, 1916, he suffered from heat exhaustion, but was able to recover enough to attend the 1916 Prohibition national convention in July. St. John died after suffering heat exhaustion on August 31, 1916, in Olathe, Kansas. His funeral was attended by Governor Arthur Capper, former governor George H. Hodges, and Herman P. Faris who served as the Prohibition Party&#x27;s representative.

<text>The Manusmṛti (), also known as the Mānava-Dharmaśāstra or the Laws of Manu, is one of the many legal texts and constitutions among the many &quot;&quot; of Hinduism.

Over fifty manuscripts of the &quot;Manusmriti&quot; are now known, but the earliest discovered, most translated, and presumed authentic version since the 18th century is the &quot;Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) manuscript with Kulluka Bhatta commentary&quot;. Modern scholarship states this presumed authenticity is false, and that the various manuscripts of &quot;Manusmriti&quot; discovered in India are inconsistent with each other.

The metrical text is in Sanskrit, is dated to the 2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE, and presents itself as a discourse given by Manu (Svayambhuva) and Bhrigu on dharma topics such as duties, rights, laws, conduct, and virtues. The text&#x27;s influence had historically spread outside India, influencing Hindu kingdoms in modern Cambodia and Indonesia.

In 1776, &quot;Manusmriti&quot; became one of the first Sanskrit texts to be translated into English (the original sanskrit book was never found), by British philologist Sir William Jones. &quot;Manusmriti&quot; was used to construct the Hindu law code for the East India Company-administered enclaves.

==Nomenclature==
The title &quot;Manusmriti&quot; is a relatively modern term and a late innovation, probably coined because the text is in a verse form. The over-fifty manuscripts discovered of the text never use this title, but state the title as &quot;Manava Dharmashastra&quot; (Sanskrit: मानव धर्मशास्त्र) in their colophons at the end of each chapter. In modern scholarship, these two titles refer to the same text.

== Chronology ==
Philologists Jones and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel, in the 18th century, dated &quot;Manusmriti&quot; to around 1250 BCE and 1000 BCE respectively, which, from later linguistic developments, is untenable due to the language of the text which must be later than the late Vedic texts such as the Upanishads, themselves dated a few centuries later, around 500 BCE. Later scholars shifted the chronology of the text to between the 1st or 2nd century CE. Olivelle adds that numismatic evidence and the mention of gold coins as a fine suggest the text may date to the 2nd or 3rd century CE. However, the majority of scholars agree that it was composed sometime between 200 BCE and 200 CE.

Most scholars consider the text a composite produced by many authors put together over a long period. Olivelle states that the various ancient and medieval Indian texts claim revisions and editions were derived from the original text with 100,000 verses and 1,080 chapters. However, the text version in modern use, according to Olivelle, is likely the work of a single author or a chairman with research assistants.

Manusmriti, Olivelle states, was not a new document - it drew on other texts, and reflects &quot;a crystallization of an accumulated knowledge&quot; in ancient India. The root of theoretical models within Manusmriti rely on at least two shastras that pre-date it: &quot;artha&quot; (statecraft and legal process) and &quot;dharma&quot; (an ancient Indian concept that includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and others discussed in various Dharmasutras, older than Manusmriti). Its contents can be traced to &quot;Kalpasutras&quot; of the Vedic era, which led to the development of &quot;Smartasutras&quot; consisting of &quot;Grihyasutras&quot; and &quot;Dharmasutras&quot;. The foundational texts of Manusmriti include many of these sutras, all from an era preceding the common era. Most of these ancient texts are now lost, and only four have survived: the law codes of &quot;Apastamba&quot;, &quot;Gautama&quot;, &quot;Baudhayana&quot; and &quot;Vasishtha&quot;.

==Structure==
The ancient version of the text has been subdivided into twelve &quot;Adhyayas&quot; (chapters), but the original text had no such division. The text covers different topics, and is unique among ancient Indian texts in using &quot;transitional verses&quot; to mark the end of one subject and the start of the next. The text can be broadly divided into four, each of different length. and each further divided into subsections:
#Creation of the world
#Source of dharma
#The dharma of the four social classes
#Law of karma, rebirth and final liberation

The text is composed in metric &quot;Shlokas&quot; (verses), in the form of a dialogue between an exalted teacher and disciples who are eager to learn about the various aspects of dharma. The first 58 verses are attributed by the text to Manu, while the remaining more than two thousand verses are attributed to his student Bhrigu. Olivelle lists the subsections as follows:

===Sources of the law===
The &quot;Dharmasya Yonih&quot; (Sources of the Law) has twenty-four verses and one transition verse. These verses state what the text considers as the proper and just sources of law:

This section of Manusmriti, like other Hindu law texts, includes fourfold sources of &quot;Dharma&quot;, states Levinson, which include &quot;Atmana santushti&quot; (satisfaction of one&#x27;s conscience), &quot;Sadachara&quot; (local norms of virtuous individuals), &quot;Smriti&quot; and &quot;Sruti&quot;.

===Dharma of the four Varnas===

*3.1 Rules Relating to Law (2.25 – 10.131)
**3.1.1 Rules of Action in Normal Times (2.26 – 9.336)
***3.1.1.1 Fourfold Dharma of a Brahmin (2.26 – 6.96) (contains the longest section of Manusmriti, 3.1, called &quot;dharmavidhi&quot;)
***3.1.1.2 Rules of Action for a King (7.1 – 9.324) (contains 960 verses, includes description of institutions and officials of state, how officials are to be appointed, tax laws, rules of war, the role and limits on the power of the king, and long sections on eighteen grounds for litigation, including those related to non-delivery under contract, breach of contract, non-payment of wages, property disputes, inheritance disputes, humiliation and defamation, physical assault, theft, violence of any form, injury, sexual crimes against women, public safety, and others; the section also includes rules of evidence, rules on interrogation of witnesses, and the organisation of court system)
***3.1.1.3 Rules of Action for Vaiśyas and Śūdras (9.326 – 9.335) (shortest section, eight rules for Vaishyas, two for Shudras, but some applicable laws to these two classes are discussed generically in verses 2.26 – 9.324)

The verses 6.97, 9.325, 9.336 and 10.131 are transitional verses. Olivelle notes instances of likely interpolation and insertions in the notes to this section, in both the presumed vulgate version and the critical edition.

===Determination of Karmayoga===
The verses 12.1, 12.2 and 12.82 are transitional verses. This section is in a different style than the rest of the text, raising questions of whether this entire chapter was added later. While there is evidence that this chapter was extensively redacted over time, it is unclear whether the entire chapter is of a later era.
*4.1 Fruits of Action (12.3–81) (section on actions and consequences, personal responsibility, action as a means of moksha – the highest personal bliss)
*4.2 Rules of Action for Supreme Good (12.83–115) (section on karma, duties and responsibilities as a means of supreme good)

The closing verses of Manusmriti declare,
==Contents==
The structure and contents of the Manusmriti suggest it to be a document predominantly targeted at the Brahmins (priestly class) and the Kshatriyas (king, administration and warrior class). The text dedicates 1,034 verses, the largest portion, on laws for and expected virtues of Brahmins, and 971 verses for Kshatriyas. The statement of rules for the Vaishyas (merchant class) and the Shudras (artisans and working class) in the text is extraordinarily brief. Olivelle suggests that this may be because the text was composed to address the balance &quot;between the political power and the priestly interests&quot;, and because of the rise in foreign invasions of India in the period it was composed.

===On virtues and outcast===
Manusmriti lists and recommends virtues in many verses. For example, verse 6.75 recommends non-violence towards everyone and temperance as key virtues, while verse 10.63 preaches that all four varnas must abstain from injuring any creature, abstain from falsehood and abstain from appropriating the property of others.

Similarly, in verse 4.204, states Olivelle, some manuscripts of Manusmriti list the recommended virtues to be, &quot;compassion, forbearance, truthfulness, non-injury, self-control, not desiring, meditation, serenity, sweetness and honesty&quot; as primary, and &quot;purification, sacrifices, ascetic toil, gift giving, Vedic recitation, restraining the sexual organs, observances, fasts, silence and bathing&quot; as secondary. A few manuscripts of the text contain a different verse 4.204, according to Olivelle, and list the recommended virtues to be, &quot;not injuring anyone, speaking the truth, chastity, honesty and not stealing&quot; as central and primary, while &quot;not being angry, obedience to the teacher, purification, eating moderately and vigilance&quot; to desirable and secondary.

In other discovered manuscripts of &quot;Manusmriti&quot;, including the most translated Calcutta manuscript, the text declares in verse 4.204 that the ethical precepts under Yamas such as Ahimsa (non-violence) are paramount while Niyamas such as Ishvarapranidhana (contemplation of personal god) are minor, and those who do not practice the &quot;Yamas&quot; but obey the &quot;Niyamas&quot; alone become outcasts.

==Significance of Manusmriti==
===On personal choices, behaviours and morals===
Manusmriti has various verses on duties a person has towards himself and to others, thus including moral codes as well as legal codes. Olivelle states that this is similar to the modern contrast between informal moral concerns to birth out of wedlock in the developed nations, along with simultaneous legal protection for children who are born out of wedlock.

Personal behaviours covered by the text are extensive. For example, verses 2.51–2.56 recommend that a monk must go on his begging round, collect alms food and present it to his teacher first, then eat. One should revere whatever food one gets and eat it without disdain, states Manusmriti, but never overeat, as eating too much harms health. In verse 5.47, the text states that work becomes without effort when a man contemplates, undertakes and does what he loves to do and when he does so without harming any creature.

Numerous verses relate to the practice of meat eating, how it causes injury to living beings, why it is evil, and the morality of vegetarianism. Yet, the text balances its moral tone as an appeal to one&#x27;s conscience, states Olivelle. For example, verse 5.56 as translated by Olivelle states, &quot;there is no fault in eating meat, in drinking liquor, or in having sex; that is the natural activity of creatures. Abstaining from such activity, however, brings greatest rewards.&quot;

===On rights of women===
Manusmriti offers an inconsistent and internally conflicting perspective on women&#x27;s rights. The text, for example, declares that a marriage cannot be dissolved by a woman or a man, in verse 8.101–8.102. Yet, the text, in other sections, allows either to dissolve the marriage. For example, verses 9.72–9.81 allow the man or the woman to get out of a fraudulent or abusive marriage and remarry.The text also provides legal means for a woman to remarry when her husband has been missing or has abandoned her.

While preaching chastity to widows such as in verses 5.158–5.160, and opposing a woman marrying someone outside her own social class in verses 3.13–3.14, in other verses, such as 2.67–2.69 and 5.148–5.155, Manusmriti preaches that as a girl, she should obey and seek protection of her father, as a young woman her husband, and as a widow her son; and that a woman should always worship her husband as a god and a man should consider his wife an embodiment of goddess. In verses 3.55–3.56, Manusmriti also declares that women must be honored, and &quot;[w]here women are revered, there the gods rejoice; but where they are not, no rite bears any fruit&quot;. Elsewhere, in verse 5.148, states Olivelle, the text declares, &quot;[a woman] must never seek to live independently&quot;.

Simultaneously, states Olivelle, the text enumerates numerous practices such as marriages outside one&#x27;s varna (see anuloma and pratiloma), such as between a Brahmin man and a Shudra woman in verses 9.149–9.157, a widow becoming pregnant by a man she is not married to in verses 9.57–9.62, marriage where a woman elopes with her lover, and then grants legal rights in these cases such as property inheritance rights in verses 9.143–9.157, and the legal rights of the children so born. The text also provides for a situation when a married woman may become pregnant by a man other than her husband, and dedicates verses 8.31–8.56 to conclude that the child&#x27;s custody belongs to the woman and her legal husband, and not to the biological father.

Manusmriti provides a woman with property rights to six types of property in verses 9.192–9.200. These include those she received at her marriage, or as gift when she eloped or when she was taken away, or as token of love before marriage, or as gifts from her biological family, or as received from her husband subsequent to marriage, and also from inheritance from deceased relatives.

Flavia Agnes states that Manusmriti is a complex commentary from women&#x27;s rights perspective, and the British colonial era codification of women&#x27;s rights based on it for Hindus, and from Islamic texts for Muslims, picked and emphasised certain aspects while it ignored other sections. This construction of personal law during the colonial era created a legal fiction around Manusmriti&#x27;s historic role as a scripture in matters relating to women in South Asia.

===On statecraft and rules of war===
Chapter 7 of the Manusmriti discusses the duties of a king, what virtues he must have, what vices he must avoid. In verses 7.54–7.76, the text identifies precepts to be followed in selecting ministers, ambassadors and officials, as well as the characteristics of well fortified capital. Manusmriti then lays out the laws of just war, stating that first and foremost, war should be avoided by negotiations and reconciliations. If war becomes necessary, states Manusmriti, a soldier must never harm civilians, non-combatants or someone who has surrendered, that use of force should be proportionate, and other rules. Fair taxation guidelines are described in verses 7.127–7.137.

==Authenticity and inconsistencies in various manuscripts==
Patrick Olivelle, credited with a 2005 translation of Manusmriti published by the Oxford University Press, states the concerns in postmodern scholarship about the presumed authenticity and reliability of Manusmriti manuscripts. He writes (abridged),

Other scholars point to the inconsistencies and have questioned the authenticity of verses, and the extent to which verses were changed, inserted or interpolated into the original, at a later date. Sinha, for example, states that less than half, or only 1,214 of the 2,685 verses in Manusmriti, may be authentic. Further, the verses are internally inconsistent. Verses such as 3.55–3.62 of Manusmriti, for example, glorify the position of women, while verse such as 9.3 and 9.17 do the opposite. Other passages found in Manusmriti, such as those relating to Ganesha, are modern era insertions and forgeries. Robert E. Van Voorst states that the verses from 3.55–60 may be about respect given to a woman in her home, but within a strong patriarchal system.

Nelson in 1887, in a legal brief before the Madras High Court of British India, had stated, &quot;there are various contradictions and inconsistencies in the Manu Smriti itself, and that these contradictions would lead one to conclude that such a commentary did not lay down legal principles to be followed but were merely recommendatory in nature.&quot; Mahatma Gandhi remarked on the observed inconsistencies within Manusmriti as follows:

==Commentaries==
There are numerous classical commentaries on the &quot; written in the medieval period.

Bhāruci is the oldest known commentator on the &quot;. Kane places him in the late 10th or early 11th century, Olivelle places him in the 8th century, and Derrett places him between 600 and 800 CE. From these three opinions we can place Bhāruci anywhere from the early 7th century CE to the early 11th century CE. Bhāruci&#x27;s commentary, titled &quot;Manu-sastra-vivarana&quot;, has far fewer number of verses than the Kullūka-Calcutta vulgate version in circulation since the British colonial era, and it refers to more ancient texts that are believed to be lost. It is also called &quot;Raja-Vimala&quot;, and J. Duncan M. Derrett states Bharuci was &quot;occasionally more faithful to his source&#x27;s historical intention&quot; than other commentators.

Medhātithi&#x27;s commentary on &quot;&quot; has been widely studied. Scholars such as Buhler, Kane, and Lingat believe he was from north India, likely the Kashmir region. His commentary on Manusmriti is estimated to be from 9th to 11th century.

Govindarāja&#x27;s commentary, titled &quot;Manutika&quot;, is an 11th-century commentary on Manusmriti, referred to by &quot;Jimutavahana&quot; and &quot;Laksmidhara&quot;, and was plagiarised by Kullūka, states Olivelle.

Kullūka&#x27;s commentary, titled &quot;Manvarthamuktavali&quot;, along with his version of the &quot;Manusmrti&quot; manuscript has been &quot;vulgate&quot; or default standard, most studied version, since it was discovered in 18th-century Calcutta by the British colonial officials. It is the most reproduced and famous, not because, according to Olivelle, it is the oldest or because of its excellence, but because it was the lucky version found first. The Kullūka commentary dated to be sometime between the 13th to 15th century, adds Olivelle, is mostly a plagiary of Govindaraja commentary from about the 11th century, but with Kullūka&#x27;s criticism of Govindaraja.

Nārāyana&#x27;s commentary, titled &quot;Manvarthavivrtti&quot;, is probably from the 14th century and little is known about the author. This commentary includes many variant readings, and Olivelle found it useful in preparing a critical edition of the Manusmriti text in 2005.

Nandana was from south India, and his commentary, titled &quot;Nandini&quot;, provides a useful benchmark on Manusmriti version and its interpretation in the south.

Other known medieval era commentaries on Manusmriti include those by Sarvajnanarayana, Raghavananda and Ramacandra.

==Significance and role in history==
===In ancient and medieval India===
Scholars doubt Manusmriti was ever administered as law text in ancient or medieval Hindu society. David Buxbaum states, &quot;in the opinion of the best contemporary orientalists, it [Manusmriti] does not, as a whole, represent a set of rules ever actually administered in India . It is in great part an ideal picture of that which, in the view of a Brahmin, ought to be law&quot;.

Donald Davis writes, &quot;there is no historical evidence for either an active propagation or implementation of Dharmasastra [Manusmriti] by a ruler or any state – as distinct from other forms of recognizing, respecting and using the text. Thinking of Dharmasastra as a legal code and of its authors as lawgivers is thus a serious misunderstanding of its history&quot;. Other scholars have expressed the same view, based on epigraphical, archaeological and textual evidence from medieval Hindu kingdoms in Gujarat, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, while acknowledging that Manusmriti was influential to the South Asian history of law and was a theoretical resource.

===Outside India===
The &quot;Dharma-sastras&quot;, particularly Manusmriti, states Anthony Reid, were &quot;greatly honored in Burma&#x27;s (Myanmar) Wareru Dhammathat, Siam (Thailand), Cambodia and Java-Bali (Indonesia) as the defining documents of the natural order, which kings were obliged to uphold. They were copied, translated and incorporated into local law code, with strict adherence to the original text in Burma and Siam, and a stronger tendency to adapt to local needs in Java (Indonesia)&quot;. The medieval era derived texts and Manusmriti manuscripts in Southeast Asia are, however, quite different than the &quot;vulgate&quot; version that has been in use since its first use in British India. The role of then extant Manusmriti as a historic foundation of law texts for the people of Southeast Asia has been very important, states Hooker.

===In British India===

Prior to the British colonial rule, Sharia (Islamic law) for Muslims in South Asia had been codified as &quot;Fatawa-e-Alamgiri&quot;, but laws for non-Muslims – such as Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis – were not codified - both in regions of the subcontinent that witnessed anything up to 600 years of Islamic rule - as well as others. With the arrival of the British colonial officials, Manusmriti played a historic role in constructing a legal system for non-Muslims in South Asia and early Western perceptions about the ancient and medieval Indian society.

In the 18th century, the earliest British of the East India Company acted as agents of the Mughal emperor. As the British colonial rule took over the political and administrative powers in India, it was faced with various state responsibilities such as legislative and judiciary functions. The East India Company, and later the British Crown, sought profits for its British shareholders through trade as well as sought to maintain effective political control with minimal military engagement. The administration pursued a path of least resistance, relying upon co-opted local intermediaries that were mostly Muslims and some Hindus in various princely states. The British exercised power by avoiding interference and adapting to law practices as explained by the local intermediaries. The existing legal texts for Muslims, and resurrected Manusmriti manuscript thus helped the colonial state sustain the pre-colonial religious and political law and conflicts, well into the late nineteenth century. The colonial policy on the system of personal laws for India, for example, was expressed by Governor-General Hastings in 1772 as follows,

For Muslims of India, the British accepted sharia as the legal code for Muslims, based on texts such the &quot;al-Sirjjiyah&quot; and &quot;Fatawa-i Alamgiri&quot; written under sponsorship of Aurangzeb. For Hindus and other non-Muslims such as Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, and Parsis, this information was unavailable. The substance of Hindu law, was derived by the British colonial officials from Manusmriti, and it became the first Dharmasastra that was translated in 1794. The British colonial officials, for practice, attempted to extract from the Dharmaśāstra, the English categories of law and religion for the purposes of colonial administration.

The British colonial officials, however, mistook the Manusmriti as codes of law, failing to recognise that it was a commentary on morals and law and not a statement of positive law. The colonial officials of the early 19th century also failed to recognise that Manusmriti was one of many competing Dharmasastra texts, it was not in use for centuries during the Islamic rule period of India. The officials resurrected Manusmriti, constructed statements of positive law from the text for non-Muslims, in order to remain faithful to its policy of using sharia for the South Asian Muslim population. Manusmriti thus played a role in constructing the Anglo-Hindu law, as well as Western perceptions about ancient and medieval era Hindu culture from the colonial times. Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na&#x27;im states the significance and role of Manusmriti in governing India during the colonial era as follows (abridged),

==Comparison with other dharmasastras==

Along with Manusmriti (&quot;Manava Dharmasastra&quot;), ancient India had between eighteen and thirty six competing &quot;Dharma-sastras&quot;, states John Bowker. Many of these texts have been lost completely or in parts, but they are referred to in other ancient Indian texts suggesting that they were influential in some regions or time. Of the numerous jurisprudence-related commentaries and Smriti texts, after Manu Smriti and other than the older Dharma Sutras, Yajnavalkya Smriti has attracted the attention of many scholars, followed by Narada Smriti and Parashara Smriti (the oldest Dharma-smriti). According to Ghose and other scholars, evidence suggests that Yajnavalkya Smriti was the more referred to text than Manu Smriti in matters of governance and practice. This text, of unclear date of composition but likely to be a few centuries after Manusmriti, is more &quot;concise, methodical, distilled and liberal&quot;. According to Jois,

Jois suggests that the Yajnavalkya Smriti text liberal evolution may have been influenced by Buddhism in ancient India. The Yajnavalkya text is also different from Manu text in adding chapters to the organisation of monasteries, land grants, deeds execution and other matters. The Yajnavalkya text was more referred to by many Hindu kingdoms of the medieval era, as evidenced by the commentary of 12th-century Vijñāneśvara, titled &quot;Mitakshara&quot;.

==Modern reception==
The &quot;Manusmrti&quot; has been subject to appraisal and criticism. Among the notable Indian critics of the text in the early 20th century was B. R. Ambedkar, who held Manusmriti as responsible for caste system in India. In protest, Ambedkar burnt &quot;Manusmrti&quot; in a bonfire on 25 December 1927. While Ambedkar condemned Manusmriti, Mahatma Gandhi opposed the book burning. The latter stated that while caste discrimination was harmful to spiritual and national growth, it had nothing to do with Hinduism and its texts such as Manusmriti. Gandhi argued that the text recognises different callings and professions, defines not one&#x27;s rights but one&#x27;s duties, that all work from that of a teacher to a janitor are equally necessary, and of equal status. Gandhi considered Manusmriti to include lofty teachings but a text with inconsistency and contradictions, whose original text is in no one&#x27;s possession. He recommended that one must read the entire text, accept those parts of Manusmriti which are consistent with &quot;truth and ahimsa (non-injury or non-violence to others)&quot; and the rejection of other parts.

The Manu Smriti was one of the first Sanskrit texts studied by the European philologists. It was first translated into English by Sir William Jones. His version was published in 1794. This interest in its translation was encouraged by British administrative requirements, which they believed to be legal codes. In fact, states Romila Thapar, these were not codes of law but social and ritual texts.

A Louis Jacolliot translation of the Calcutta version of &quot;Law of Manu&quot; was reviewed by Friedrich Nietzsche. He commented on it both favourably and unfavorably:
*He deemed it &quot;an incomparably spiritual and superior work&quot; to the Christian Bible, observed that &quot;the sun shines on the whole book&quot; and attributed its ethical perspective to &quot;the noble classes, the philosophers and warriors, [who] stand above the mass&quot;. Nietzsche does not advocate a caste system, states David Conway, but endorses the political exclusion conveyed in the Manu text. Nietzsche considered Manu&#x27;s social order as far from perfect, but considers the general idea of a caste system to be natural and right, and stated that &quot;caste-order, order of rank is just a formula for the supreme law of life itself&quot;, a &quot;natural order, lawfulness par excellence&quot;. According to Nietzsche, states Julian Young, &quot;Nature, not Manu, separates from each other: predominantly spiritual people, people characterized by muscular and temperamental strength, and a third group of people who are not distinguished in either way, the average&quot;. He wrote that &quot;To prepare a book of law in the style of Manu means to give a people the right to become master one day, to become perfect, – to aspire to the highest art of life.&quot;
*The Law of Manu was also criticised by Nietzsche. He, states &quot;These regulations are instructive enough: here we encounter for once Aryan humanity, quite pure, quite primordial,—we learn that the concept of &quot;pure blood&quot; is the opposite of a harmless concept&quot;.

B. R. Ambedkar asserted that Manu Smriti was written by a sage named Brigu during the times of Pushyamitra of Shunga in connection with social pressures caused by the rise of Buddhism. However, historian Romila Thapar considers these claims to be exaggerations. Thapar writes that archaeological evidence casts doubt on the claims of Buddhist persecution by Pushyamitra. Support of the Buddhist faith by the Shungas at some point is suggested by an epigraph on the gateway of Bharhut, which mentions its erection &quot;during the supremacy of the Shungas&quot;.

Pollard et al. state that the code of Manu was derived to answer questions on how men could rebuild their societies following a series of floods. Swami Dayananda Saraswati, the founder of Arya Samaj, held the text to be authentic and authoritative. Other admirers of the text have included Annie Besant.

Friedrich Nietzsche is noted to have said &quot;Close the Bible and open the Manu Smriti. It has an affirmation of life, a triumphing agreeable sensation in life and that to draw up a lawbook such as Manu means to permit oneself to get the upper hand, to become perfection, to be ambitious of the highest art of living.&quot;

<text>The Violin Sonata No. 9 in A major, Op. 47, by Ludwig van Beethoven, is an 1803 sonata for piano and violin notable for its technical difficulty, unusual length (around 40 minutes), and emotional scope. It is commonly known as the Kreutzer Sonata () after the violinist Rodolphe Kreutzer, to whom it was ultimately dedicated, but who thoroughly disliked the piece and refused to play it.

==Composition==

In the composer&#x27;s 1803 sketchbook, the work was titled &quot;Sonata per il Pianoforte ed uno violino obligato in uno stile molto concertante come d’un concerto&quot; (&quot;Sonata for the piano and one obligatory violin in a highly &quot;concertante&quot; style like a concerto&quot;). The final movement of the work was originally written for another, earlier, sonata for violin and piano by Beethoven, the Sonata No. 6, Op. 30, No. 1, in A major.

Beethoven gave no key designation to the work. Although the work is usually titled as being in A major, the Austrian composer and music theoretician Gerhard Präsent has published articles indicating that the main key is in fact A minor.

==Premiere and dedication==

The sonata was originally dedicated to the violinist George Bridgetower (1778–1860) as &quot;Sonata mulattica composta per il mulatto Brischdauer [Bridgetower], gran pazzo e compositore mulattico&quot; (Mulatto Sonata composed for the mulatto Brischdauer, great madman mulatto composer). Shortly after completion the work was premiered by Bridgetower and Beethoven on 24 May 1803 at the Augarten Theatre at a concert that started at the unusually early hour of 8:00 am. Bridgetower sight-read the sonata; he had never seen the work before, and there had been no time for any rehearsal.

After the premiere performance, Beethoven and Bridgetower fell out: while the two were drinking, Bridgetower apparently insulted the morals of a woman whom Beethoven cherished. Enraged, Beethoven removed the dedication of the piece, dedicating it instead to Rodolphe Kreutzer, who was considered the finest violinist of the day.

==Structure==
The piece is in three movements, and takes approximately 43 minutes to perform:
==Reception==

After its successful premiere in 1803, the work was published in 1805 as Beethoven&#x27;s Op. 47, with its re-dedication to Rudolphe Kreutzer, which gave the composition its nickname. Kreutzer never performed the work, considering it &quot;outrageously unintelligible&quot;. He did not particularly care for any of Beethoven&#x27;s music, and they only ever met once, briefly.

Referring to Beethoven&#x27;s composition, Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s novella &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot; was first published in 1889. That novella was adapted in various stage and film productions, contributing to Beethoven&#x27;s composition becoming known to the general public.

Rita Dove&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Sonata Mulattica&quot; reimagined the life of Bridgetower, the sonata&#x27;s original dedicatee, in poetry, thus writing about the sonata that connected the composer and the violinist who first performed it.

<text>Troy Edward Glaus (; born August 3, 1976) is an American former professional baseball third baseman and first baseman. Glaus played in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Anaheim Angels (–), Arizona Diamondbacks (), Toronto Blue Jays (–), St. Louis Cardinals (–), and the Atlanta Braves (). Glaus lettered in baseball while attending UCLA. He won a bronze medal in baseball at the 1996 Summer Olympics as a member of the U.S. national baseball team. Glaus was a four-time All-Star and won World Series MVP honors in .

==Professional career==
In 13 seasons, Glaus hit .254 with 320 home runs and 950 RBI in 1537 games. In 19 postseason games, he hit .347 with nine home runs and 16 RBI. Glaus has been selected to four All-Star Games, three with the Angels and one with the Blue Jays.

===Anaheim Angels===
Glaus began his career with the Angels in and was installed as the team&#x27;s starting third baseman in .

Glaus had a breakout season in , becoming the all-time single season home run leader in Angels history with 47 while leading third baseman in adjusted range factor (2.95) in 2000.

Glaus participated in the 2001 MLB All-Star Game and posted his second consecutive 40 home run season with 41 on the year.

In , Glaus failed to reach the 40 home run club for the first time since the 1999 season, but he managed to hit thirty home runs in helping the Angels make the playoffs for the first time in 16 years. The Angels beat the San Francisco Giants in seven games in the 2002 World Series to win their first world championship title in team history. Glaus was awarded the World Series MVP award as he hit .385 with three home runs and eight RBIs and hit a go-ahead double in Game 6 to finish a five-run comeback for the Angels. Glaus had another All-Star year in .

Glaus missed much of the season with a shoulder injury. 2004 was the last year of his contract with the Angels. As an established veteran, he was in demand on the free agent market and able to field lucrative offers for long-term contracts. Although Glaus had spent his entire career an Angel, and was a fan favorite, the team decided not to pursue Glaus&#x27; return. Amid concerns about Glaus&#x27; future health after his injury, the team decided to go with the much lower-priced alternative of turning the third base position over to young prospect Dallas McPherson, who they felt had a good chance to soon become as productive as Glaus had been.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
Glaus ultimately signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks for US$45 million over four years. He worked through his back problems in the season with the Diamondbacks, hitting 37 home runs with 97 RBIs. He also led the league in adjusted range factor (2.92), but his 24 errors tied him with David Wright for the most errors by a third baseman in the Major Leagues, and he had a Major League-low .946 fielding percentage at third.

===Toronto Blue Jays===

After the 2005 season, Glaus was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in the off-season along with minor league shortstop Sergio Santos. The trade sent pitcher Miguel Batista and second baseman Orlando Hudson to the Diamondbacks. The Jays badly needed a power bat a year after letting go of Carlos Delgado, however the emergence of Hudson at second base gave the statistical advantage of this trade to the Diamondbacks. Although Glaus was converted from shortstop to third base in the minors (and played 10 games at shortstop for the Angels), he started at shortstop for the Toronto Blue Jays against the Chicago White Sox on May 26, , due to the demotion of shortstop Russ Adams. Glaus was not expected to do much fielding due to the fact the pitcher that day was known to induce many fly balls, instead of ground balls. This defensive alignment didn&#x27;t affect his hitting, collecting two hits with a home run. Glaus made several starts at shortstop for the Blue Jays, usually when Toronto was facing National League opponents at their home ballpark, where there is no DH.

After hitting 38 home runs and 104 RBI in the 2006 season, Glaus earned a single 10th place vote for the 2006 American League MVP Award.

In 2006, Glaus had the lowest zone rating of any Major League third baseman (.741).

In Glaus&#x27;s production was hampered all year by foot injuries and his production fell.

On December 13, 2007, he was cited in the Mitchell Report.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
Glaus was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for fellow third baseman Scott Rolen on January 14, 2008. This worked out well for the Cardinals, as Glaus did about as well as, or better than, his career rates in most offensive categories. Furthermore, Glaus committed only seven errors in 146 games and led the league with a .982 fielding percentage at 3B.

On September 3, 2008, he hit his 300th career home run off Doug Davis of the Arizona Diamondbacks in the third inning.

He underwent arthroscopic right shoulder surgery on January 21, . The Cardinals initially expected him to be ready around the start of 2009 season, but after a setback in his rehabilitation he was placed on the 15-day DL; after another reassessment the Cardinals announced that they did not expect him to return until June 2009. On July 11, 2009, he was assigned to the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League on a rehabilitation assignment. He returned September 2, against the Brewers in the bottom of the 6th inning.

===Atlanta Braves===
Following an injury-shortened 2009 season with the St. Louis Cardinals, Glaus signed a one-year $1.75 million contract with the Atlanta Braves, a deal that allowed him to earn an additional $2.25 million in performance and roster bonuses. He became the starting first baseman in 2010.

After a rough April in which he hit below the Mendoza Line, Glaus rebounded to become Player of the Month in May, hitting .330 with six home runs and 28 RBI. As of August 9, Glaus was hitting .242 with 14 home runs and 63 RBI.

Glaus&#x27;s production faltered in July and August. After Atlanta acquired Derrek Lee on August 18 to play first base, Glaus was placed on the DL with knee fatigue. Glaus had a few setbacks, but returned to Atlanta in a back-up role behind Derrek Lee and rookie Freddie Freeman.

Glaus made only one appearance at third base during the regular season, but was used at third base in Game 2 of the NLDS against the San Francisco Giants, starting a key double play. Glaus then started Game 4 of the series at third base.

==Personal life==
Glaus relocated to San Diego in 2020, with his wife, Ann. He also has one son, Ty.

<doc id="1260864" wikidata="Q3415909" url="?curid=1260864" title="Rabble.ca">
<text>rabble.ca is an independent, non profit, English-language Canadian online magazine founded in 2001. It features podcasts, videos and a discussion board called &quot;babble&quot;.

== History ==
Judy Rebick and Mark Surman founded rabble.ca on April 18, 2001. The launch coincided with the Summit of the Americas in Quebec, and rabble covered the Summit during its first week of operation.

Anti-globalization activist Jaggi Singh was an early contributor. Due to his participation in protests at the Summit of the Americas he was jailed for offences including possession of a weapon. Rabble, along with other left-wing organisations and activists, wrote an open letter calling for his release.

Upon its launch, the website raised $200,000, which included $120,000 from the Atkinson Foundation.

In 2005 rabble launched a first podcast network, developed by journalist Wayne MacPhail. In the same year, Judy Rebick resigned as publisher and was replaced by past Managing Editor, Kim Elliott. On September 7, 2008, rabble.ca launched a multi-author election blog. The blog featuring authors such as Maude Barlow and the Council of Canadians and organizations such as the Rideau Institute.

== Contributors ==
Judy Rebick, Naomi Klein, Francine Pelletier, Anna Dashtgard, Patty Barrera, Priscilla Settee, Penney Kome, Doris Anderson, Ann Shin and Sandra DeLaronde were among the original contributors at the launch of the website.

Judy Rebick retired in 2006 and was replaced by Amnesty International member Kim Elliott.

Former &quot;Financial Post&quot; columnist Murray Dobbin is the guest senior contributing editor for &quot;rabble.ca&quot;.

The advisory committee of &quot;rabble.ca&quot; is composed of Dave Mitchell, Fred Wilson, John Urquhart, Linda McQuaig, Lynn Coady, and Sharon Fraser.

== Reception ==
&quot;rabble.ca&quot; has received both praise and criticism from a range of media analysts. Shauna Rempel of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; praised &quot;Rabble&quot; for its use of the Internet to propel activism, while journalist Colby Cosh dismissed it as &quot;a hobby for Judy Rebick [...] on the Canadian left&quot; and a &quot;vanity web project&quot;.

<text>Ephraïm Inoni (born 16 August 1947) is a Cameroonian politician who was Prime Minister of Cameroon from 2004 to 2009. He was a long-time aide of President Paul Biya and is a member of the ruling Cameroon People&#x27;s Democratic Movement (RDPC). He was appointed to the position of Prime Minister by Biya on December 8, 2004 and was sworn in that day.

==Career==
Inoni is an Anglophone and a member of the Bakweri ethnic group. He was born in the village of Bakingili, near Limbé, in the Southwest Region of Cameroon. He was Municipal Treasurer of Douala from 1981 to 1982, then treasurer of the Cameroonian Embassy to the United States from 1982 to 1984 and Director of Account Balancing at the Ministry of Finance from 1984 to 1988. He was later named Secretary of State for Finances on April 9, 1992, and then Deputy Secretary General to the Presidency on November 27, 1992, serving in the latter position until his appointment as prime minister in December 2004.

Inoni is a member of the Central Committee of the RDPC. He was part of the campaign team for Biya&#x27;s election campaign in the 2004 presidential election and was the president of the campaign&#x27;s support committee in the Southwest Province.

Biya dismissed Inoni from his post as prime minister on June 30, 2009, appointing another anglophone, Philémon Yang, to replace him. The reshuffle was the largest shakeup since Inoni&#x27;s own appointment as Prime Minister. President Biya stated on state radio that twelve ministers were sacked (including Inoni and the defence minister), six joined and three changed places. It is thought that public anger over rising food prices and the high level of government corruption in conjunction with Biya&#x27;s attempts to shore up support for the next presidential election led to the sacking, while Inoni had been in the midst of securing $140 million in aid from the International Monetary Fund, although an official explanation was not given.

Suspected of corruption during his time in office, Inoni was arrested on 16 April 2012. This arrest came as part of Operation Epevier (sparrow hawk), an anti-corruption campaign launched by President Paul Biya in 2004. This arrest was in connection with Operation Albatross, over the purchase at great expense in 2003 of the presidential aircraft, which turned out to have serious flaws on its maiden flight with the presidential couple from the Douala International airport to Paris in 2004. He was one of a number of high-level officials arrested during the course of a crackdown on corruption.

Ephraim Inoni has been under interrogation behind closed doors by examining magistrates as part of the judicial process in the case popularly known in Cameroon as the &quot;Albatross Affair&quot;. He was placed under pre-trial detention by the Mfoundi High Court in Yaounde. As of June 2024 &quot;at least&quot;, Mr. Ephraïm Inoni&#x27;s whereabouts are currently unknown.

An early biographical sketch is given in Njeuma 1999

<text>As with most other professional sports, [[ice hockey]] is [[broadcasting|broadcast]] both on radio and television.

==History==
The first dissemination of game scores via electronic means was done by telegraph, starting in the 1890s. In Montreal&#x27;s Victoria Rink, telegraph lines were installed to send game descriptions to operators in Winnipeg for the 1896 Stanley Cup challenge between Montreal and Winnipeg.

On February 8, 1923 the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game was made. &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot; reporter Norman Albert described the third-period action of a game between Midland and North Toronto at Toronto&#x27;s Arena Gardens. The radio station was CFCA, owned by the newspaper. The station also carried the first NHL radio broadcast on February 14, 1923, with the broadcast of the third-period of a game between the Toronto St. Patricks and the Ottawa Senators at the same arena.

The first complete hockey game carried over the radio was on February 22, 1923 on CJCG out of Winnipeg of a game between the Winnipeg Falcons and the Port Arthur Bearcats. The first complete broadcast of a professional game was made on March 14, 1923 on CKCK out of Regina, Saskatchewan and reported by Pete Parker. The game was not an NHL contest, but rather a Western Canada Hockey League featuring the Regina Capitals. The first hockey game televised in Canada was on October 11, 1952 of a game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Detroit Red Wings, played at the Montreal Forum, a few weeks after television arrived in Canada. However, the 1952 Memorial Cup finals, taking place several months before the inauguration of TV broadcasting in Canada, were televised on a closed-circuit basis to CBC Television&#x27;s offices, using equipment leased from NBC in New York. Foster Hewitt was play-by-play commentator for the test run, so network and ad executives could see how well hockey could be televised.

As in other sports, television has had a major effect on hockey. The infusion of money has made the major leagues far more professional with vastly higher salaries for players. It has also changed the game as NHL rules now mandate three commercial breaks per period, giving players time to recuperate and allowing the better players to be on the ice longer. However, it also lengthens and slows the games considerably.

Games today are also broadcast over the Internet. The NHL website allows fans to listen to online broadcasts of every NHL game.

===Asia===
Yes TV&#x27;s All Sports Network signed a multi-year deal with the NHL to broadcast over 130 regular season games, beginning in the 2008–09 NHL season to broadcast NHL All-Star games, Stanley Cup playoffs and Stanley Cup Finals, as well as NHL highlight programs.

===Canada===
In Canada, NHL hockey is broadcast every Saturday night on CBC&#x27;s longest-running television show, &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. During the week, other games are shown on cable channels TSN and RDS. Various local channels carry other games as well. During the NHL playoffs, CBC carries four of the Conference Quarterfinals (first, second, fourth, and sixth choice), two of the Conference semifinals (first and third choice), all games of one conference final and games 4-7 of the other (or all games if involving a Canadian team). TSN gets the remainder.

CBC also carries many international tournaments, such as the World Cup of Hockey. The Winter Olympics in 1998, 2002 and 2006 were on CBC, but the 2010 games were on CTV and RDS. Major games like those of the 1972 Summit Series or the 2002 Winter Olympics have received some of the highest ratings in Canadian television history. Other well-known tournaments, like the Spengler Cup or the Memorial Cup, are carried on Rogers Sportsnet. TSN and RDS carry all IIHF events, such as the World Junior Championships and World Championships.

Several Canadian Hockey League (CHL; the umbrella organization for Canada&#x27;s junior hockey leagues) and American Hockey League (AHL) games are broadcast by local channels in Canada, as is the occasional university game.

&quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, or &quot;HNIC&quot;, is by far CBC&#x27;s most profitable show and supports many of the corporation&#x27;s other ventures.

===United States===
According to Foster Hewitt&#x27;s book His Own Story the first TV hockey broadcasts occurred in the late 1940s in New York and Detroit as Foster was interviewed as a hockey guest in both cities. Hockey hasn&#x27;t traditionally fared as well on American television compared to the NBA, MLB, or the NFL. In fact, hockey broadcasting on a national scale was spotty prior to 1981; NBC and CBS held rights at various times, but neither network carried anything close to a full schedule, even carrying only selected games of the Stanley Cup Finals. From 1971 to 1995, there was no exclusive coverage of games in the United States.

In 1981, the fledgling USA Network (formerly MSG Network) carried 35 regular-season games a year and a full schedule of playoff games through 1985, supplanted by ESPN in 1985 and SportsChannel in 1989. ESPN regained the national hockey contract in 1993, joined by the Fox network in 1995.

Fox had put much effort into trying to stimulate American interests in the game, but had achieved little success. One of their schemes was to make the hockey puck more visible by highlighting it on television with a blue comet, using FoxTrax. When a slapshot over 70 miles per hour was made, the puck would leave a red comet trail on the television. This idea was met with great derision in Canada, especially to diehard hockey fans, and also met with little success in the United States, often ridiculed by comedians on both sides of the border.

Fox got out of the hockey business in 1999 after being massively outbid - surprisingly, given Fox&#x27;s low ratings - by ESPN&#x27;s fellow Disney network ABC. This $600 million contract was signed in 1998 and was regarded as a failure.

Before the 2004–05 lockout, the NHL had reached two separate deals with NBC and ESPN. The NBC deal stipulated that the network would pay the league no rights fees - an unheard of practice to that point. NBC&#x27;s deal included six regular season windows, seven postseason broadcasts and games 3–7 of the Stanley Cup Finals in primetime. The contracts were to commence when the lockout ended. The NBC deal was to expire after the 2006–07 season, but NBC picked up the option to renew for the 2007–08 season (Just like the AFL/NBC agreement, which the network did not renew in 2006). The NHL and NBC share in revenues from advertising.

ESPN had a two-year deal that they opted out of after the lockout, leaving the NHL without a cable partner. In August 2005, Comcast (who owns the Philadelphia Flyers) paid $70 million a year for three years to put games on the OLN network, now known as Versus. Versus is now known as the NBC Sports Network. Due to the abbreviated off-season, the 2005–06 schedule did not offer OLN exclusivity, which they received in 2006–07. NBC Sports Network will also cover the playoffs and will exclusively air Games 1 and 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals.

On March 10, 2021, ESPN and Turner Sports agreed to seven-year deals to air NHL games, including airing NHL games on ABC, where for the first time, will air the Stanley Cup Finals matches in its entirely, although this only occurs during even-numbered years, while Turner Sports will also the Stanley Cup Finals during odd-numbered years. ESPN will also air up to 75 games 

The NHL&#x27;s American television popularity has been increasing since the debut of the NHL Winter Classic in 2008; the Winter Classic has earned Nielsen ratings on par with those the league had in 1975, when there were far fewer channels and much less audience fracturing.

Minor league hockey has more limited national coverage; the America One network currently holds broadcast rights to select games in the American Hockey League and the ECHL, the two top minor leagues in North America.

Individual teams (both major and minor, though far more common in the major leagues) have long contracted to air their games on local channels, primarily on Regional sports networks and in a few cases on broadcast channels as well.

Collegiate hockey&#x27;s television coverage has expanded in the late 2000s, with national networks CSTV, and ESPNU carrying numerous regular-season contests. ESPNU airs the NCAA&#x27;s Division I tournament (with the semifinals airing on ESPN2 and the final game on ESPN), and CSTV carries games from other levels&#x27; tournaments. Regular-season games can also be found on specialty channels Big Ten Network and Fox College Sports, along with Midwest regional sports networks FSN North, FSN Wisconsin, and FSN Detroit.

===Europe===
In 2004, the NHL announced that games would be broadcast across the European continent on the ESPN America as part of a four-year deal that would also include live streaming of games across the Internet. The league previously had agreements with the Galaxie network of the Czech Republic and NTV&#x27;s TV7 channel in Russia.

<text>The Nesomyidae are a family of African rodents in the large and complex superfamily Muroidea. It includes several subfamilies, all of which are native to either continental Africa or to Madagascar. Included in this family are Malagasy rodents, climbing mice, African rock mice, swamp mice, pouched rats, and the white-tailed rat.

==Characteristics==

Nesomyids are small- to medium-sized rodents, with the largest being the size of a rat. Physically, they may resemble mice, rats, voles, or hamsters, depending on the species and subfamily. Their diets vary from fairly strict herbivory to nearly pure insectivory. Their habits are similarly variable, with some species climbing trees, and others burrowing in the ground. They give birth to up to four young after a gestation period around six weeks.

==Classification==

Many of these animals were once thought to be related to other groups of muroid rodents, but this African-based clade has been proposed and confirmed on the basis of genetic studies. Such alternate arrangement include the pouched rats in the family Muridae, and the white-tailed rat in the family Cricetidae. Likewise, all members of the Nesomyidae are often placed in the family Muridae along with all other members of the Muroidea.

Nesomyids are classified in six subfamilies, 21 genera, and 68 species.

<doc id="1260893" wikidata="Q607325" url="?curid=1260893" title="Gay Talese">
<text>Gaetano &quot;Gay&quot; Talese (; born February 7, 1932) is an American writer. As a journalist for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine during the 1960s, he helped to define contemporary literary journalism and is considered, along with Joan Didion, Truman Capote, Norman Mailer, Hunter S. Thompson, and Tom Wolfe, one of the pioneers of New Journalism. Talese&#x27;s most famous articles are about Joe DiMaggio and Frank Sinatra.

== Early life and education==
Born in Ocean City, New Jersey, the son of Italian immigrant parents, Talese graduated from Ocean City High School in 1949.

Talese&#x27;s entry into writing was entirely happenstance and the unintended consequence of his attempt as a high school sophomore to gain more playing time in the baseball team. The assistant coach had the duty of telephoning in the chronicle of each game to the local newspaper and when he complained he was too busy to do it properly, the head coach gave Talese the duty. As he recalls in his 1996 memoiristic essay &quot;Origins of a Nonfiction Writer&quot;:

After only seven sports articles, Talese was given his own column for the weekly &quot;Ocean City Sentinel-Ledger&quot; in Ocean City. By the time he left for college in September 1949, he had written some 311 stories and columns for the &quot;Sentinel-Ledger&quot;.

Talese credits his mother as the role model he followed in developing the interviewing techniques that he would during his career. He relates in &quot;Origins of a Nonfiction Writer&quot;:

Talese graduated from the University of Alabama in 1953. His selection of a major was, as he described it, a moot choice. &quot;I chose journalism as my college major because that is what I knew,&quot; he recalls, &quot;but I really became a student of history.&quot; At university, he became a brother of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity.

It was there that Talese would begin to employ literary devices more well known for fiction, such as establishing the &quot;scene&quot; with minute details and beginning articles &quot;in medias res&quot;. During his junior year, he became the sports editor for the campus newspaper, &quot;The Crimson White&quot;, and started a column he dubbed &quot;Sports Gay-zing&quot;, for which he wrote on November 7, 1951:

==Career==
=== Newspaper reporter ===
After graduation in June 1953, Talese relocated to New York City, yet could only find work as a copyboy. The job, however, was at &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He was eventually able to get an article published in the &quot;Times&quot;, albeit unsigned. In &quot;Times Square Anniversary&quot; (November 2, 1953), Talese interviewed the man, Herbert Kesner, Broadcast Editor, who was responsible for managing the headlines that flash across the famous marquee above Times Square.

Talese followed this with an article in the February 21, 1954 edition concerning the chairs used on the boardwalk of Atlantic City. However, his budding journalism career would have to be put on hold, as he was drafted into the United States Army in 1954.

Talese had been required (as were all male students at the time owing to the Korean War) to join the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) and had relocated to New York awaiting his eventual commission as a second lieutenant. Talese was sent to Fort Knox, Kentucky, to train in the Tank Corps. Finding his mechanical skills lacking, Talese was transferred to the Office of Public Information where he worked for an army newspaper, &quot;Inside the Turret&quot; (known today as &quot;The Gold Standard&quot;), and soon had his own column, &quot;Fort Knox Confidential&quot;.

When Talese completed his military service in 1956, he was rehired by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a sports reporter. Talese later opined, &quot;Sports is about people who lose and lose and lose. They lose games; then they lose their jobs. It can be very intriguing.&quot; Of the various fields, boxing had the most appeal for Talese, largely because it was about individuals engaged in contests and those individuals in the mid to late 1950s were becoming predominately non-white at the prizefight level. He wrote 38 articles about Floyd Patterson alone.

Talese was then assigned to the &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; Albany Bureau to cover state politics. It was a short-lived assignment, however, as his exacting habits and meticulous style soon irritated his new editors so much that they recalled him to the city, assigning him to write minor obituaries. Talese puts it, &quot;I was banished to the obituary desk as punishment – to break me. There were major obituaries and minor obituaries. I was sent to write minor obituaries not even seven paragraphs long.&quot; After a year working for the &quot;Times&quot; obituary section, he began to write articles for the Sunday &quot;Times&quot;, which was then managed as a separate organization from the daily &quot;Times&quot; by editor Lester Markel.

=== Magazine reporter ===
Talese&#x27;s first piece for the magazine &quot;Esquire&quot; – a series of scenes in New York City – appeared in a special New York issue in July 1960. When the &quot;Times&quot; newspaper unions had a work stoppage in December 1962, Talese had plenty of time to watch rehearsals for a production by Broadway director Joshua Logan for an &quot;Esquire&quot; profile. As Carol Polsgrove indicates in her history of &quot;Esquire&quot; during the 1960s, it was the kind of reporting he liked to do best: &quot;just being there, observing, waiting for the climactic moment when the mask would drop and true character would reveal itself.&quot;

In 1964, Talese published &quot;The Bridge: The Building of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge&quot;, a reporter-style, non-fiction depiction of the construction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in New York City. In 1965, he left &quot;The New York Times&quot; to write full-time for editor Harold Hayes at &quot;Esquire&quot;. His 1966 &quot;Esquire&quot; article on Frank Sinatra, &quot;Frank Sinatra Has a Cold&quot;, is one of the most influential American magazine articles of all time, and a pioneering example of New Journalism and creative nonfiction. With what some have called a brilliant structure and pacing, the article focused not just on Sinatra himself, but also on Talese&#x27;s pursuit of his subject.

Talese&#x27;s celebrated &quot;Esquire&quot; essay about Joe DiMaggio, &quot;The Silent Season of a Hero&quot; – in part a meditation on the transient nature of fame – was also published in 1966.

For his part, Talese regarded his 1966 profile of obituarist Alden Whitman, &quot;Mr. Bad News&quot;, as his finest.

A number of Talese&#x27;s &quot;Esquire&quot; essays were collected into the 1970 book &quot;Fame and Obscurity&quot;; in its introduction, Talese paid tribute to two writers he admired, citing &quot;an aspiration on my part to somehow bring to reportage the tone that Irwin Shaw and John O&#x27;Hara had brought to the short story.&quot;

In 1971, Talese published &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot;, a book about the travails of the Bonanno crime family in the 1960s, especially Salvatore Bonanno and his father Joseph. The book was based on seven years of research and interviews. &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot; was made into a TV movie in 1973.

Talese signed a $1.2 million contract with Doubleday in 1972 to write two books, with the first, &quot;Thy Neighbor&#x27;s Wife&quot;, due in 1973. Paperback rights to &quot;Thy Neighbor&#x27;s Wife&quot; were sold to Dell Publishing for $750,000 in 1973. He missed Doubleday&#x27;s initial deadline and spent 8 years researching the book, including managing massage parlors in New York and running a sex shop. In 1979 United Artists paid Talese a record $2.5 million for the film rights. The book was eventually published in 1981 but no film was produced.

In 2008, The Library of America selected Talese&#x27;s 1970 account of the Charles Manson murders, &quot;Charlie Manson&#x27;s Home on the Range&quot;, for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime.

In 2011, Talese won the Norman Mailer Prize for Distinguished Journalism.

== Personal life ==
In 1959, Talese married writer Nan Talese (née Ahearn), a New York editor who manages the Nan A. Talese/Doubleday imprint. Their marriage is being documented in a non-fiction book he has been working on since 2007. They have two daughters, Pamela Talese, a painter, and Catherine Talese, a photographer and photo editor.

Talese was a close friend of fellow journalist and author Tom Wolfe.

===Views===
Talese is a lifelong Democrat. Despite this, he was a fierce critic of President Barack Obama and has defended President Donald Trump on several occasions. In a February 2017 interview with &quot;Haaretz&quot;, Talese said, “This crazy Trump, hustler, real estate tycoon, I think he’s better than Obama. We love to say Obama is Frederick Douglass, Obama is Booker T. Washington, Obama is Paul Robeson, the enlightenment. Well it didn’t work.&quot;

== Controversies ==
In April 2016, Talese spoke at a panel at a Boston University journalism conference. During the panel, Talese was asked what nonfiction women writers he found inspiring, to which he responded, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know any women writers that I loved.&quot; In response, a Twitter hashtag was created under #womengaytaleseshouldread.

In June 2016, the credibility of Talese&#x27;s book &quot;The Voyeur&#x27;s Motel&quot;, whose subject was Gerald Foos, was questioned when it came to light Foos had made false statements to Talese which Talese did not verify. When news of the credibility broke, Talese stated, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to promote this book. How dare I promote it when its credibility is down the toilet?&quot; In subsequent interviews and on an appearance on &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot;, Talese recanted this disavowal, stating that his story was still accurate despite the discrepancies found by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

In a November 2017 interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; at the New York Public Library&#x27;s Literary Lions Gala, Talese made comments about the sexual assault accusations against Kevin Spacey that had surfaced over the previous weeks. Talese stated, &quot;I would like to ask [Spacey] how it feels to lose a lifetime of success and hard work all because of 10 minutes of indiscretion 10 years or more ago. I feel so sad, and I hate that actor that ruined this guy&#x27;s career. So, OK, it happened 10 years ago... Jesus, suck it up once in a while! You know something, all of us in this room at one time or another did something we&#x27;re ashamed of. The Dalai Lama has done something he&#x27;s ashamed of. The Dalai Lama should confess... put that in your magazine!&quot; CNN reported the &quot;backlash on social media was almost immediate.&quot; Jenavieve Hatch of the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; called the remarks &quot;disrespectful to survivors of sexual trauma.&quot; &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;&#x27;s Tom Sykes wrote &quot;chastising an alleged child sexual harassment victim is a terrible look.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called his statements a &quot;bizarre, rabid defense of the actor.&quot;

<text>City region is a term used by urbanists, economists and urban planners to refer to how one or more core cities are linked to a hinterland by functional ties, such as economic, housing-market, commuting, marketing or retail catchment factors. This concept emphasizes the importance of these functional relationships in understanding urban areas and their surrounding regions, often providing more insightful perspectives than the arbitrary boundaries assigned to administrative bodies.

==Global perspective==
Using Geographic information system (GIS) technology, city-regions have been mapped globally, revealing significant interconnectedness among urban centers and their surrounding areas. The Nature Cities article “Worldwide Delineation of Multi-Tier City–Regions” classified over 30,000 urban centers into four tiers—town, small, intermediate, and large city—based on population size and mapped their catchment areas based on travel time rather than administrative boundaries. Travel time is used to reflect daily commuting patterns within a 1-hour limit and less frequent activities up to a 3-hour limit. This publicly available dataset shows that 3.2 billion people have physical access to multiple tiers within an hour, and 4.7 billion within three hours. It also distinguishes between primary and secondary city-regions; in secondary ones, catchment areas of urban centers overlap with those of larger centers. This approach highlights how people rely on multiple urban centers for different needs, with larger centers offering a wider range of activities. For example, a person might shop in a nearby town, work in an intermediate city, and use an airport in a large city, thus belonging to the catchment areas of several urban centers. The City–Regions System Toolbox (CREST) allows to check out any country&#x27;s distribution in population access to cities of different sizes based on travel time.

==United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom, the city regional agenda began to be seen as an alternative to the regional assemblies in England that were favoured as a partial answer to the West Lothian question but rejected in a referendum by voters in North East England in November 2004. The concept of city regions and their development features heavily in The Northern Way, a collaborative development plan between the three northernmost English regional development agencies. An embryonic city regional framework exists in the form of the Passenger Transport Executive and the Core Cities Group. The October 2006 Local Government White Paper did not contain firm proposals for city-region-wide authorities however.

The New Local Government Network proposed the creation of city regions as part of on-going reform efforts, while a report released by the IPPR&#x27;s Centre for Cities proposed the creation of four large city-regions based on Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Greater Manchester. The strong economy of Edinburgh and its hinterland (Forth Valley, Fife, West Lothian, Midlothian and East Lothian) means it has been named as one of Europe&#x27;s fasting growing city-regions.

Also in 2006, the OECD published a number of studies on city regions, including an assessment profile of the Newcastle-Gateshead city region and a review of numerous city regions across the world.

In July 2007, HM Treasury published its &quot;Review of sub-national economic development and regeneration&quot;, which stated that the government would allow those city regions that wished to work together to form a statutory framework for city regional activity, including powers over transport, skills, planning and economic development. Under the government&#x27;s Transport Innovation Fund, city regions can band together to pilot forms of road pricing, such as the Greater Manchester congestion charge considered by councils in Greater Manchester (but later rejected by referendum). In the April 2009 Budget, the government announced that Greater Manchester and Leeds would be the first two city regions with formal powers. While this was later discontinued as a result of the May 2010 general election, the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government did agree to the creation of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority in 2011, with all other proposals and the regional development agencies being subsumed into the local enterprise partnerships.

== France ==
Since January 2010 municipalities, departments and cities can combine into a larger body known as a Metropole. The first Metropole in France, Nice-Cote-d&#x27;Azur was created in 2011. In 2014 the government of Jean-Marc Ayrault passed a bill that moved away from the voluntary nature and made it mandatory for all Metropolitan areas of over 600,000 inhabitants to become Metropoles as of January 1, 2015. The first 3 mandatory Metropoles are;
* Greater Paris
* Aix-Marseille-Provence
* Lyon

Metropoles take over certain determined responsibilities from the State, other sub-national bodies or quasi-public bodies. Once devolved to the Metropole these responsibilities are the sole responsibility of the Metropole. In addition to assuming responsibility for certain policy Metropoles also take over responsibility for tax collection.

== Poland ==
* Metropolis GZM

== Spain ==
* Community of Madrid

== Thailand ==
* Bangkok Metropolitan Region

== Italy ==
Metropolitan cities of Italy, previously Provinces of Italy, including Metropolitan City of Rome

==Netherlands==
A plusregio (also called stadsregio) is a regional public body of several Dutch municipalities in an urban area which statutory tasks are assigned under Chapter XI of the &quot;Wet gemeenschappelijke regelingen&quot;.

== Afghanistan ==
Five major city regions have been identified in Afghanistan based on functional relationships. These center around Kabul and the four regional hub cities of Herat, Kandahar, Mazari-i-Sharif and Jalalabad. It is estimated that the five city regions comprise approximately one third of the total Afghan population.

<doc id="1260905" wikidata="Q2717121" url="?curid=1260905" title="Silent mutation">
<text>Silent mutations, also called synonymous or samesense mutations, are mutations in DNA that do not have an observable effect on the organism&#x27;s phenotype. The phrase &quot;silent mutation&quot; is often used interchangeably with the phrase &quot;synonymous mutation&quot;; however, synonymous mutations are not always silent, nor vice versa. Synonymous mutations can affect transcription, splicing, mRNA transport, and translation, any of which could alter phenotype, rendering the synonymous mutation non-silent. The substrate specificity of the tRNA to the rare codon can affect the timing of translation, and in turn the co-translational folding of the protein. This is reflected in the codon usage bias that is observed in many species. Mutations that cause the altered codon to produce an amino acid with similar functionality (&quot;e.g.&quot; a mutation producing leucine instead of isoleucine) are often classified as silent; if the properties of the amino acid are conserved, this mutation does not usually significantly affect protein function.

==Genetic code==
The genetic code translates mRNA nucleotide sequences to amino acid sequences. Genetic information is coded using this process with groups of three nucleotides along the mRNA which are commonly known as codons. The set of three nucleotides almost always produce the same amino acid with a few exceptions like UGA which typically serves as the stop codon but can also encode tryptophan in mammalian mitochondria. Most amino acids are specified by multiple codons demonstrating that the genetic code is degenerate–different codons result in the same amino acid. Codons that code for the same amino acid are termed synonyms. Silent mutations are base substitutions that result in no change of the amino acid or amino acid functionality when the altered messenger RNA (mRNA) is translated. For example, if the codon AAA is altered to become AAG, the same amino acid – lysine – will be incorporated into the peptide chain. 

Mutations are often linked to diseases or negative impacts but silent mutations can be extremely beneficial in creating genetic diversity among species in a population. Germ-line mutations are passed from the parent to the offspring. Scientists have predicted that people have approximately 5 to 10 deadly mutations in their genomes but this is essentially harmless because there is usually only one copy of a particular bad gene so diseases are unlikely. Silent mutations can also be produced by insertions or deletions, which cause a shift in the reading frame.

Because silent mutations do not alter protein function they are often treated as though they are evolutionarily neutral. Many organisms are known to exhibit codon usage biases, suggesting that there is selection for the use of particular codons due to the need for translational stability. Transfer RNA (tRNA) availability is one of the reasons that silent mutations might not be as silent as conventionally believed.

There is a different tRNA molecule for each codon. For example, there is a specific tRNA molecule for the codon UCU and another specific for the codon UCC, both of which code for the amino acid serine. In this instance, if there was a thousand times less UCC tRNA than UCU tRNA, then the incorporation of serine into a polypeptide chain would happen a thousand times more slowly when a mutation causes the codon to change from UCU to UCC. If amino acid transport to the ribosome is delayed, translation will be carried out at a much slower rate. This can result in lower expression of a particular gene containing that silent mutation if the mutation occurs within an exon. Additionally, if the ribosome has to wait too long to receive the amino acid, the ribosome could terminate translation prematurely.

==Structural consequences==

=== Primary structure ===

A nonsynonymous mutation that occurs at the genomic or transcriptional levels is one that results in an alteration to the amino acid sequence in the protein product. A protein&#x27;s primary structure refers to its amino acid sequence. A substitution of one amino acid for another can impair protein function and tertiary structure, however its effects may be minimal or tolerated depending on how closely the properties of the amino acids involved in the swap correlate. The premature insertion of a stop codon, a nonsense mutation, can alter the primary structure of a protein. In this case, a truncated protein is produced. Protein function and folding is dependent on the position in which the stop codon was inserted and the amount and composition of the sequence lost.

Conversely, silent mutations are mutations in which the amino acid sequence is not altered. Silent mutations lead to a change of one of the letters in the triplet code that represents a codon, but despite the single base change, the amino acid that is coded for remains unchanged or similar in biochemical properties. This is permitted by the degeneracy of the genetic code.

Historically, silent mutations were thought to be of little to no significance. However, recent research suggests that such alterations to the triplet code do affect protein translation efficiency and protein folding and function.

Furthermore, a change in primary structure is critical because the fully folded tertiary structure of a protein is dependent upon the primary structure.  The discovery was made throughout a series of experiments in the 1960s that discovered that reduced and denatured RNase in its unfolded form could refold into the native tertiary form.  The tertiary structure of a protein is a fully folded polypeptide chain with all hydrophobic R-groups folded into the interior of the protein to maximize entropy with interactions between secondary structures such as beta sheets and alpha helixes.  Since the structure of proteins determines its function, it is critical that a protein be folded correctly into its tertiary form so that the protein will function properly.  However, it is important to note that polypeptide chains may differ vastly in primary structure, but be very similar in tertiary structure and protein function.

=== Secondary structure ===

Silent mutations alter the secondary structure of mRNA.

Secondary structure of proteins consists of interactions between the atoms of the backbone of a polypeptide chain, excluding the R-groups.  One common type of secondary structures is the alpha helix, which is a right-handed helix that results from hydrogen bonds between the &quot;nth&quot; amino acid residue and the &quot;n+4th&quot; amino acid residue.  The other common type of secondary structure is the beta sheet, which displays a right-handed twist, can be parallel or anti-parallel depending on the direction of the direction of the bonded polypeptides, and consists of hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl and amino groups of the backbone of two polypeptide chains.

mRNA has a secondary structure that is not necessarily linear like that of DNA, thus the shape that accompanies complementary bonding in the structure can have significant effects. For example, if the mRNA molecule is relatively unstable, then it can be rapidly degraded by enzymes in the cytoplasm. If the RNA molecule is highly stable, and the complementary bonds are strong and resistant to unpacking prior to translation, then the gene may be under expressed. Codon usage influences mRNA stability.

Furthermore, since all organisms contain a slightly different genetic code, their mRNA structures differ slightly as well, however, multiple studies have been conducted that show that all properly folded mRNA structures are dependent on the primary sequence of the polypeptide chain and that the structure is maintained by dinucleotide relative abundances in the cell matrix.  It has also been discovered that mRNA secondary structure is important for cell processes such as transcript stability and translation. The general idea is that the functional domains of mRNA fold upon each other, while the start and stop codon regions generally are more relaxed, which could aid in the signaling of initiation and termination in translation.

If the oncoming ribosome pauses because of a knot in the RNA, then the polypeptide could potentially have enough time to fold into a non-native structure before the tRNA molecule can add another amino acid. Silent mutations may also affect splicing, or transcriptional control.

=== Tertiary structure ===

Silent mutations affect protein folding and function. Normally a misfolded protein can be refolded with the help of molecular chaperones. RNA typically produces two common misfolded proteins by tending to fold together and become stuck in different conformations and it has a difficulty singling in on the favored specific tertiary structure because of other competing structures. RNA-binding proteins can assist RNA folding problems, however, when a silent mutation occurs in the mRNA chain, these chaperones do not bind properly to the molecule and are unable to redirect the mRNA into the correct fold.

Recent research suggests that silent mutations can have an effect on subsequent protein structure and activity. The timing and rate of protein folding can be altered, which can lead to functional impairments.

==Research and clinical applications==

Silent mutations have been employed as an experimental strategy and can have clinical implications.

Steffen Mueller at the Stony Brook University designed a live vaccine for polio in which the virus was engineered to have synonymous codons replace naturally occurring ones in the genome. As a result, the virus was still able to infect and reproduce, albeit more slowly. Mice that were vaccinated with this vaccine and exhibited resistance against the natural polio strain.

In molecular cloning experiments, it can be useful to introduce silent mutations into a gene of interest in order to create or remove recognition sites for restriction enzymes.

Mental disorders can be caused by silent mutations. One silent mutation causes the dopamine receptor D2 gene to be less stable and degrade faster, underexpressing the gene.

A silent mutation in the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), which codes for a cellular membrane pump that expels drugs from the cell, can slow down translation in a specific location to allow the peptide chain to bend into an unusual conformation. Thus, the mutant pump is less functional.

Deviations from average pain sensitivity are caused by both an ATG to GTG mutation (nonsynonymous), and a CAT to CAC mutation (synonymous). These two mutations are both shared by the low pain sensitivity and high pain sensitivity gene. Low pain sensitivity has an additional CTC to CTG silent mutation, while high pain sensitivity does not and shares the CTC sequence at this location with average pain sensitivity.

=== Multi-Drug Resistance Gene 1 ===

Around 99.8% of genes that undergo mutations are deemed silent because the nucleotide change does not change the amino acid being translated. Although silent mutations are not supposed to have an effect on the phenotypic outcome, some mutations prove otherwise like the Multi-Drug Resistance Gene 1. MDR1 codes for the P-glycoprotein which helps get rid of drugs in the body. It is located in the intestines, liver, pancreas, and brain. MDR 1 is located in the same places that CYP3A4 is located in, which is an enzyme that helps get rid of toxins or drugs from the liver and intestines. Silent mutations like MDR 1 do express a change in phenotypic response. A study done on mice showed when they did not have enough of the MDR 1 gene, their body did not recognize the ivermectin or cyclosporine drug, leading to the creation of toxins in their bodies.

MRD1 has over fifty single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP&#x27;s) which are changes in the nucleotide base sequence. In MDR1 the gene exon 26 which represents 3535C can mutate to 3535T which then changes the transfer RNA into one that is not often as seen, leading to changes in the outcome during translation. This is an example of how some silent mutations are not always silent. The multi-drug resistance genes at Exon 26 C3435T, exon 21 G2677T/A, and exon 12 C1236T have been studied to have SNP&#x27;s that occur at the same time, therefore making the phenotypic &quot;function &quot;change. This suggests a haplotype dependency between exon 26 and other exon that have polymorphisms. For example, efavirenz and nelfinavir are two types of drugs that help decrease the HIV infection in a person&#x27;s body. When the SNP from exon 26 is coupled with other SNP exons, the drugs have a lower chance of maintaining the HIV infection. Although, when the TT nucleotides in exon 26 are expressed the patient has a lower concentration of the virus but when the genotype morphs into CC or CT the infection is able to spread like normal leaving the MDR 1 gene almost defenseless. These changes in bases of exon 26 for MDR 1 show a correlation between the MDR 1 gene mutations and the ability of the antiretroviral drugs to suppress the HIV infection.

Exon 26 has also been studied as to whether it is haplotype dependent or not. The presence of the SNP of exon 26 changes phenotypic functions when it is paired with the presence of mutations from exons 12 and 21. But when acting alone, it does not affect the phenotypic outcome as strongly. An example of exon 26’s haplotype dependency is seen when looking at chemotherapy. Since MDR 1 removes drugs from our cells, inhibitors have been used to block MRD 1&#x27;s ability to remove drugs, thus letting beneficial drugs like chemotherapy and immunosuppressants aid the body in recovery more efficiently. MDR1 has different proteins that help exile these specific drugs from cancer cells. Verapamil and cyclosporine A are common inhibitors for MDR 1. Unfortunately, when C3435T is mutated with a mutation from either exon 12 or exon 21 (or if all three mutations occur at the same time creating a haplotype), the inhibitors are less likely to weaken the function of MDR1. Multiple silent mutated genes tend to be more resistant against these inhibitors.

Looking at the molecular level, the reason why C3435T in exon 26 of MDR 1 gene is not silent is because of the pace at which the amino acids are being translated to proteins. mRNA’s secondary structures can fold which means different codons correspond to different folding&#x27;s of the mRNA. For example, when exon 26 changes ATC to ATT both codons produce the same amino acid but ATC is seen more often than the mutation codon. As a consequence, the amount of time it takes for the ribosome to produce its protein confirmation is changed. This leads to a protein structure different from the usual shape of the protein which leads to different functions of the protein.

Other reasons behind MDR1’s “silent mutation” occurs in messenger RNA. In mRNA, codons also work as exon splicing enhancers. Codons decide when to cut out introns based on the codon it is reading in mRNA. The mutated codons have a higher risk of making a mistake when splicing introns out of the mRNA sequence leading to the wrong exons being produced. Therefore, making a change to the mature messenger RNA. Mutations in the Multi-Drug Resistance Gene 1 show how silent mutations can have an effect on the outcome of the phenotype.

<text>Eugen Baumann (12 December 1846 – 3 November 1896) was a German chemist. He was one of the first people to create polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and, together with Carl Schotten, he discovered the Schotten-Baumann reaction.

==Life==
Baumann was born in Cannstatt, which is now part of Stuttgart. After he attended a gymnasium in Stuttgart, he was educated in the pharmacy of his father. During his time in Stuttgart, he attended the lectures of Hermann von Fehling at the University of Stuttgart.

To broaden his education, he went to Lübeck and Gothenburg to work in pharmacies there. Later, he studied pharmacy at the University of Tübingen. He passed his first exam in 1870 and received his PhD in 1872 for work with Felix Hoppe-Seyler. He followed Hoppe-Seyler to the University of Straßburg where did his habilitation in 1876. The same year, Emil Heinrich Du Bois-Reymond offered him a position as the Head of the Chemistry Department of the Institute of Physiology in Berlin. In 1882, Baumann became professor of medicine at that institute, and subsequently obtained professor position at the University of Freiburg.

In 1895, he took over the management of Hoppe-Seyler&#x27;s &quot;Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie&quot; with Albrecht Kossel.

From 1883 till his death, Baumann was married to Theresa Kopp, the daughter of chemist Hermann Kopp, and they had five children. He died at the age of 49 due to a heart problem.

==Work==
The organosulfur compounds of urine were his starting point into the physiological chemistry. He identified the source for aromatic compounds in urine being the aromatic amino acids, such as tyrosine. He influenced the organosulfur chemistry by the synthesis of thioacetals and thioketals. These substances were subsequently used by other scientists, for example for anesthesia. Together with his coworkers, he was able to prove that thyroxine was the active ingredient in the thyroid gland.

==Schotten-Baumann reaction==
During his work at the physiological institute, Baumann, together with Carl Schotten, discovered a method to synthesize amides from amines and acid chlorides; this method is still known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction.

<text>Topa Inca Yupanqui or Túpac Inca Yupanqui (), also Topa Inga Yupangui, erroneously translated as &quot;noble Inca accountant&quot; (before 14711493) was the tenth Sapa Inca (1471–93) of the Inca Empire, fifth of the Hanan dynasty. His father was Pachacuti, and his son was Huayna Capac. Topa Inca belonged to the &quot;Qhapaq Panaca&quot; (one of the clans of Inca nobles). His quya (principal wife) was his older sister, Mama Ocllo.

==Biography==
His father appointed him to head the Inca army before his reign as emperor, granting him the title of Auqui, or crown prince, at a young age. Topa Inca launched multiple large-scale expeditions to the north during his period as Auqui, subduing regions such as Hatun Xauxa, the Bombon Plateau, and Huaylas. Cities and sites the army he commanded besieged and captured at this time include Curamba, Huaylla-Pucara, Canta, and, most importantly, Chan Chan. 
He extended the realm along the Andes through modern Ecuador, and developed a special fondness for the city of Quito, which he rebuilt with architects from Cuzco. During this time his father Pachacuti reorganized the kingdom of Cuzco into the &quot;Tawantinsuyu&quot;, the &quot;region of four provinces&quot;. Topa Inca led extensive military conquests to extend the Inca empire across much of Southern America.

He became Sapa Inca (sole ruler) in his turn upon his father&#x27;s death in 1471, ruling until his own death in 1493. He conquered Chimor, which occupied the northern coast of what is now Peru, the largest remaining rival to the Incas.

He conquered the province of Antisuyu and subdued the Qulla people. He imposed rules and taxes, creating two Suyuyoc Apu (Governor Generals), one in Jauja and the other in Tiahuanaco. The fortress Saksaywaman, established by Pachacuti on the high plateau above Cusco, was constructed throughout Topa Inca Yupanqui&#x27;s reign.

Topa Inca died about 1493 in Chincheros, leaving two legitimate sons, and 90 illegitimate sons and daughters. Chuqui Ocllo, one of the wives of Topa Yupanqui, convinced him that his son Capac Huari would succeed him, however, Topa Inca Yupanqoi changed his mind and decided on his son Titu Cusi Hualpa (who would later become emperor Huayna Capac). This provoked anger in Chuqui Ocllo and she poisoned Topa Inca. She and her favorite son were both killed soon after Topa Inca&#x27;s death.

==The Pacific Expedition==

===Original account===
Topa Inca Yupanqui is also credited with leading a roughly 10-month-long voyage of exploration into the Pacific around 1470, under the reign of his father, reportedly visiting islands he called &quot;Nina Chumpi&quot; (&quot;fire belt&quot;) and &quot;Hawa Chumpi&quot; (&quot;outer belt&quot;, also spelled &quot;Avachumpi, Hahua chumpi&quot;). The voyage is mentioned in the &quot;History of the Incas&quot; by Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, as well as in the works of Martín de Murúa and Miguel Cabello de Balboa. Pedro Sarmiento described the expedition as follows:
:…there arrived at Tumbez some merchants who had come by sea from the west, navigating in balsas with sails. They gave information of the land whence they came, which consisted of some islands called Avachumbi and Ninachumbi, where there were many people and much gold. Topa Inca was a man of lofty and ambitious ideas, and was not satisfied with the regions he had already conquered. So he determined to challenge a happy fortune, and see if it would favour him by sea.…

:The Inca, having this certainty, determined to go there. He caused an immense number of balsas to be constructed, in which he embarked more than 20,000 chosen men.…

:Topac Inca navigated and sailed on until he discovered the islands of Avachumbi and Ninachumbi, and returned, bringing back with him slaves, gold, a chair of brass, and a skin and jaw bone of a horse. These trophies were preserved in the fortress of Cusco until the Spaniards came. The duration of this expedition undertaken by Topa Inca was nine months, others say a year, and, as he was so long absent, every one believed he was dead.

===Analysis===
Historians and anthropologists such as María Rostworowski, Waldemar Espinoza, José Antonio del Busto Duthurburu and Jean Hervé Daude, believe that the two islands mentioned by the chroniclers are Mangareva and Easter Island, where oral traditions have claimed that a group of long-eared &quot;hanau eepe&quot; came to the island from an unknown land. Some historians, however, are skeptical that the voyage ever took place.

 &quot;title&quot;: &quot;State highways in New Jersey before 1927.map&quot;
&lt;/mapframe&gt;

New Jersey was one of the first U.S. states to adopt a system of numbered state highways. New Jersey&#x27;s original numbered highway system was first legislated in 1916, succeeding another proposal submitted in 1913 by the State Highway commission. By 1923, 24 routes had been numbered. Due to a lack of central organizing oversight, many routes were legislated, but not numbered. A partial renumbering was proposed in 1926 to eliminate duplicates and give numbers to all routes, and in 1927 a full renumbering was carried out.

==History==
===19th century===
The earliest efforts for the state of New Jersey to maintain a network of highways dates back to 1891, when law was passed allotting funds for the construction of highways.

===20th century===
This was bolstered in 1894 with the creation of a Commissioner of Public Roads, which evolved into the State Highway Commission in 1909. The first highways the commission created were the Ocean Highway and the Delaware River Drive, created in 1909 and 1911 respectively. The first effort at a state-wide highway network was begun by the commission in 1912 and submitted for approval in 1913. This system was never put in place; instead, the first permanent system to define a system of highways in the state was created by the &quot;Egan Bill&quot; (1916 state laws, chapter 285), which designated the initial system of 13 routes, bolstered by the &quot;Edge Bill&quot; (L. 1917 c. 14), which went into more detail on funding, maintenance, and similar issues. At this time most primary roads in the state had trail numbers which bore no resemblance to the highway numbers; these were soon obsoleted by the new system.

However, after 1921, the process was less coordinated, as local politicians tried to get their route built without concern for duplication of numbers. The State Highway Commission was not allowed to change the numbers; the best they could do was assign suffixes. Where multiple routes existed with the same number, suffixes of N and S were used for the northernmost and southernmost. Starting in 1923, various unnumbered routes were also assigned; none of these were taken over by 1927.

Construction and maintenance transfers began by 1917 with Route 13 (the Lincoln Highway, now Route 27) north of Kingston; the routes were marked by 1922.

In 1926, a partial renumbering was proposed to eliminate duplicates and assign a number to every route; this would have given the system numbers from 1 to 30. Instead, a total renumbering was adopted in 1927 as public law chapter 319. This system, known as the 1927 renumbering, assigned numbers from 1 to 12 in North Jersey, 21 to 28 roughly radiating from Newark, 29 to 37 from Trenton, 38 to 47 from Camden, and 48 to 50 in South Jersey. Portions of the pre-1927 routes that had been taken over or built, but were not assigned new numbers, kept their old numbers. These four routes - Route 4N, Route 5N, Route 8N, and Route 18N were all assigned the suffix N since the only suffixed one to remain was 18N, and the others needed to be distinguished from the new routes of the same number.

<text>Frank Parker Day (9 May 1881 – 30 July 1950) was a Canadian athlete, academic and author.

Since Day&#x27;s father was a Methodist minister who moved to a new congregation every three years, Day spent his youth living throughout Nova Scotia, in Wallace, Acadia Mines, Mahone Bay, Boylston, and Lockeport.

==Early life and education==
Frank Parker Day was born in Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia on 9 May 1881. When he was seventeen, he attended Lunenburg Academy and from there went on to earn a BA, in 1903 from Mount Allison University. Day was a member of the varsity rugby football team while completing his undergraduate studies. On the school&#x27;s new athletic field Day scored Mount Allison&#x27;s first points in the intercollegiate Rugby football in 1900.

He later won a Rhodes Scholarship, studying at Oxford University in 1905. Day was an athlete, and won the Oxford-Cambridge Heavyweight Championship. Returning to Canada, he embarked on an academic career, teaching English at the University of New Brunswick, before being appointed president of Union College in Schenectady, New York.

==War service==
Having served with the King Edward&#x27;s Light Horse while at Oxford University, followed by a year with the 28th New Brunswick Dragoons before filling the position of junior major with the 85th Overseas Battalion. Day served in the Canadian Army. where he played a crucial role in recruiting and training of the 185th Canadian Infantry Battalion (Cape Breton Highlanders), CEF.

Details of the 94th Victoria Regiment &quot;Argyll Highlanders&quot; were called out on active service on 6 August 1914 for local protection duties.

The 85th Battalion (Nova Scotia Highlanders), CEF was authorized on 10 July 1915 and embarked for Great Britain on 12 October 1916. It disembarked in France on 10 February 1917, where it fought as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Division in France and Flanders until the end of the war. The battalion was subsequently disbanded on 15 September 1920.

The 185th Canadian Infantry Battalion (Cape Breton Highlanders), CEF was authorized on 15 July 1916 with Day as its lieutenant colonel, and embarked for Great Britain on 12 October 1916. There it provided reinforcements for the Canadian Corps in the field until 15 February 1918, when its personnel were absorbed by the 17th Reserve Battalion, CEF. Day then commanded the 25th Battalion from August to October 1918.

==Literary career==
He practiced writing poetry, songs, essays, and news items during his student and army days. After the war he wrote stories for the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

==Later life==
When the Days came back to Nova Scotia to live, they still had a struggle to make a living as Frank&#x27;s medical expenses had been considerable, including the cost of convalescing in the Southern States and the West Indies. Frank was unsuccessful in getting war disability allowance. His arthritis had stemmed from a blow on the back during a battle in World War I. Retiring to the family cottage the Days spent their time at the tiny village of Lake Annis in Yarmouth County, where Frank spent his time with friends Harry Hamilton and Joe (Jim) Charles, the Mi&#x27;kmaq guide in Hectanooga. They spent their season fishing, hunting, and paddling the waterways of Yarmouth County.
Frank Parker Day died at his home in Yarmouth on 30 July 1950.

<doc id="1260935" wikidata="Q1028464" url="?curid=1260935" title="Camelback locomotive">
<text>A camelback locomotive (also known as a Mother Hubbard or a center-cab locomotive) is a type of steam locomotive with the driving cab placed in the middle, astride the boiler. Camelbacks were fitted with wide fireboxes which would have severely restricted driver visibility from the normal cab location at the rear.

==Development==
The camel and the camelback design were developed separately by two different railroads in different eras. Though the name is often incorrectly used interchangeably, they had little in common other than the placement of the cab. Unlike the later Camelbacks, Camels had cabs that rode atop the boiler. Ross Winans wanted to put as much weight on the driving wheels as possible to increase traction. Camelbacks have a cab that straddles the boiler. While Camelbacks have the same idea of moving the cab forward, they had it for different reasons. Camelbacks were developed to allow for the use of larger fireboxes, such as the Wootten, which would obstruct the engineer&#x27;s view from a conventionally placed cab. Camelbacks were particularly known for being used on the Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Reading Railroad. 

===Early use===
The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad began to look into developing high-powered steam locomotives in the early 1840s, and in 1844–1847 built a series of locomotives nicknamed &quot;muddiggers&quot;. As with many early B&amp;O locomotives, a spur gear drive was used to connect the main shaft to the driving wheels. The long 0-8-0 wheelbase pushed this connection to the back of the locomotive and caused the floor of the cab to be lifted up above the whole assembly.

In 1853 Ross Winans, who had designed the &quot;muddiggers&quot;, built the first of a series of 0-8-0 camel locomotives. These had long cabs that ran from the back of the smokebox to the front of the firebox. The firebox itself sloped back on the earliest models. The fireman worked from a large platform on the tender, and in some cases had a chute to allow him to deliver coal to the front of the grate. 

Also in 1853, Samuel Hayes, the Master of Machinery for the railroad, had built a series of camel 4-6-0 locomotives for passenger service. The layout of the locomotive was roughly the same as for Winans&#x27; freight locomotives, except for the addition of the four-wheel leading bogie. Copies and variations on these locomotives were built into the 1870s, with the last retirements coming in the 1890s. These were called the &quot;Hayes Ten-Wheelers&quot;. 
Many camelback locomotives used anthracite.
The B&amp;O examples burned conventional bituminous coal. The large fireboxes of these locomotives were made obsolete by better boiler design.

The B&amp;O Railroad Museum has recently restored their Camel Locomotive and returned it to display. It now is in its original colors and markings for the first time since it left the Mt. Clare Shops in 1869. The Museum also has a Central of New Jersey Camelback, the 
No. 592, which was donated to the Museum in the 1950s.

===The Wootten firebox ===

John E. Wootten developed the Wootten firebox to effectively burn culm, anthracite waste, which was a plentiful, cheap source of fuel. Wootten determined that a large, wide firebox would work best. As the successful trailing truck used to support large fireboxes had not yet been developed, Wootten instead mounted his huge firebox above the locomotive&#x27;s driving wheels.

===First Camelbacks===
Originally Wooten firebox engines were built with the cab sitting upon the top of the firebox, in the rear. The first Wooten firebox locomotives 4-6-0 &quot;Ten Wheeler&quot; types were built in early 1877 by the P&amp;R&#x27;s Reading, Pennsylvania shops. However they were not a &quot;camelback&quot; design. The Wooten firebox proved a success; the fuel cost saving was about $2,000 a year (approx. $30,000 now). A Wooten firebox engine, P&amp;R 412 was exhibited at the 1879 International Technological Exhibition in Paris, where it won a silver medal. Following the exhibition it toured Europe, first to sell anthracite coal and later to sell Wooten firebox engines. The engine could not demonstrate on European lines because, due to the cab sitting on top of the firebox, it was too tall to fit under bridges and through tunnels. The 412&#x27;s engineer C. Gilbert Steffe came up with a solution. In a French railroad yard, he had the cab removed from the firebox and placed forward of the firebox on the running boards, creating the first camelback locomotive. The engine demonstrated in France and Italy through 1879 and was returned to the U.S. in 1880. Because the camelback design allowed for a taller firebox, the design was used by many of the railroads operating in the anthracite regions of Pennsylvania. By the time of World War 1, the diameter of locomotive boilers had increased to the point the cab astride the boiler was no longer practical and railroads stopped building camelbacks and subsequent Wooten firebox engines were built with conventional end cabs. Camelback engines were constructed with many different wheel arrangements, 0-4-0, 0-6-0, 0-8-0, 2-6-0, 2-8-0, 2-8-2, 4-4-0, 4-4-2, and 4-6-0 were the most common wheel arrangements. The largest ones had a 0-8-8-0 arrangement and were the only articulated Camelbacks built.

===Later Camelbacks===
By the 1920s, many Camelback Ten Wheelers with boiler pressure at 200psi were in daily use pulling passenger trains on the Lehigh Valley, the Philadelphia and Reading, and the Central Railroad of New Jersey, particularly the last two. For their relatively small size, they were powerful, quick to accelerate, very stable at speed, and could be operated as fast as 90 miles per hour such as on the Reading&#x27;s Atlantic City line. Some continued in service into the 1950s.

==Safety concerns==
The Camelback&#x27;s cab astride the boiler design raised concerns for its crew. The separation of engineer and fireman limited their ability to communicate with each other. Also, the engineer was perched above the side-rods of the locomotive, vulnerable to swinging and flying metal if anything rotating below should break; in many cases, the fireman was exposed to the elements at the rear. 

The Philadelphia and Reading&#x27;s crews referred to these locomotives as Mother Hubbards. The B&amp;O crews, who had co-use of the Reading&#x27;s line from Philadelphia to Bound Brook NJ (the Reading&#x27;s junction with the Central RR of New Jersey&#x27;s line to Jersey City across from New York City) called the Camelbacks &quot;Snappers&quot; in reference to a possible side rod snapping and flailing into the cab. Many Camelbacks were converted into end-cab locomotives. The advent of the mechanical stoker which moved coal from the tender to the locomotive and its associated underfloor machinery placed cab floors and tender decks higher, and from that vantage point the engineer was safe.

It is a common myth that the Interstate Commerce Commission issued a ban on Camelback locomotives due to these concerns; such a ban was never issued.

==Survivors==
There are five known Camelback locomotives to survive today:

* Central Railroad of New Jersey 4-4-2 No. 592, at the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.
* Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad 4-6-0 No. 173, at the National Museum of Transportation, St. Louis.
* Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad 4-6-0 No. 305 (formerly No. 217), at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.
* Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western 4-4-0 No. 952, at the Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri.
* Reading Company 0-4-0 No. 1187, at the Age of Steam Roundhouse Museum in Sugarcreek, Ohio. (cosmetic restoration)

<doc id="1260937" wikidata="Q3276314" url="?curid=1260937" title="The Dancing Girl of Izu">
<text>is a short story (or, accounting for its length, a novella) by Japanese writer and Nobel Prize winner Yasunari Kawabata first published in 1926.

==Plot==
The narrator, a twenty-year-old student from Tokyo, travels the Izu Peninsula during the last days of the summer holidays, a journey which he undertook out of a feeling of loneliness and melancholia. His paths repeatedly cross with a troupe of five travelling musicians, one man and four women, while heading for Mount Amagi tunnel. He is impressed by the beauty of the youngest looking woman in the troupe, who carries a heavy drum, and decides to follow them.

After traversing the tunnel, Eikichi, the troupe&#x27;s male leader, starts a conversation with him, telling him that he and his companions are from Ōshima Island and on a short tour before the cold season sets in. In Yugano, where the group rests for the night, the narrator learns from Eikichi that the young woman, Kaoru, is his 14 year old sister. The other troupe members are Eikichi&#x27;s wife Chiyoko, his mother-in-law, and a maid. In the evening, the musicians entertain guests in another inn in the village. The student hears Kaoru playing her drum, worrying if she might be harassed by her listeners.

The next day, the narrator witnesses the naked Kaoru coming out of the bath house, waving at him. The sight makes him laugh, realising that she is still a young, innocent girl. Although the day of his return to Tokyo is approaching, he accepts the musicians&#x27; offer to keep them company for another day. During a walk, the student overhears Kaoru and Chiyoko saying what a nice person he is, which enlightens him and distracts him both from his melancholia and from the fact that the group are poor, uneducated people. Eikichi&#x27;s mother-in-law invites him to their home during his winter holidays, but later forbids Kaoru to accompany him to the cinema.

The next morning, the student enters a boat in Shimoda which takes him back to Tokyo, seen off by Eikichi and the grieving Kaoru. On the boat, he starts to cry, saddened by the parting but at the same time sensing a feeling of relief.

==Publication history==
Kawabata Yasunari made a trip to the peninsula Izu in the autumn of 1918 while being a student of the First Higher School in Tōkyō. In 1919, he published the short story &quot;Chiyo&quot; () in a journal (, &quot;kōyūkai zasshi&quot;) of his school with a dancer at its center. In 1922, he wrote a further version, (&quot;yugashima de no omoide&quot;, Reminiscences in Yugashima), a manuscript of 107 pages, but published it partially only in 1948 in the collection (&quot;shōnen&quot;). The story &quot;The Dancing Girl of Izu&quot; was first published in &quot;Bungei Jidai&quot; magazine in two parts in 1926 and in book form by Kinseido in 1927 together with nine other stories.

==Reception and legacy==
Reviewing the 1997 American publication, Mark Morris in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;The Dancing Girl of Izu&quot; a &quot;deceptively simple story […] about cleansing, purification&quot;, pointing out for one the &quot;effacement of adult female sexuality and its replacement by an impossible white void of virginity&quot;, a common theme with Kawabata, as well as the protagonist&#x27;s &quot;personal absolution&quot;, received from people constantly living with the &quot;stigma of social exclusion&quot;.

In his review of a 2000 anthology, Donald Richie rated &quot;The Izu Dancer&quot; as Kawabata&#x27;s most famous and popular work, an autobiographical and &quot;seemingly artless […] evocation of first love itself&quot;.

==Translations==
&quot;The Dancing Girl of Izu&quot; was first translated into English by Edward Seidensticker, being the first story by Kawabata which saw an English translation, and published in an abridged form as &quot;The Izu Dancer&quot; in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in its 1955 edition. The translation is divided into six sections (I–VI), instead of the original seven (1–7). It is abridged at two parts that are speculated of being made for political reasons during the years of the cold war. Other, uncommented abbreviations are related to the scene at the end of the original section 3 concerning the games of Go and Five in a row, or to the scene in the latter half of the original section 4 concerning the reading from the travel notes of Mito Kōmon (, &quot;Mito Kōmon man&#x27;yūki&quot;).
Two new unabridged English translations, both in 1997, were provided by J. Martin Holman and again by Edward Seidensticker. In 1942, it was already published in German in a translation by Oscar Benl.

==Contribution of the story to the awarding of the Nobel Prize==

In 1968, Kawabata Yasunari received the Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his narrative mastery, which with great sensibility expresses the essence of the Japanese mind&quot;. 
Although Anders Österling in his presentation speech on 10 December 1968 does not mention the story by name, he said:
: In a youthful short story, which first drew attention to him at the age of twenty-seven, he tells of a student who, during lonely autumn walks on the peninsula of Izu, comes across a poor, despised dancing girl, with whom he has a touching love affair; she opens her pure heart and shows the young man a way to deep and genuine feeling.
Until the end of 1968 the story was translated into 9 different languages.

<text>Reginald VelJohnson (born Reginald Johnson; August 16, 1952) is an American actor. He is best known for playing police officer characters, such as Carl Winslow on the sitcom &quot;Family Matters,&quot; which ran from 1989 to 1998, and LAPD Sergeant Al Powell in the films &quot;Die Hard&quot; and &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;.

==Early life==
VelJohnson was born Reginald Johnson in New York City, in the borough of Queens. His mother Eva was a nurse’s aide, while his father Dan was a hospital attendant. His father left the family, which included Reginald&#x27;s brother Barry, when Johnson was 13 years old. Their mother subsequently married John Reilly, and Johnson attended Benjamin N. Cardozo High School. 

He obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts in theater from New York University, where he had a chance to work with Joseph Papp&#x27;s &quot;Black/Hispanic Shakespeare Company&quot;, in which Morgan Freeman and CCH Pounder were among his fellow actors. Early in his acting career, he changed his name from Reginald Johnson to Reginald VelJohnson. He later said he changed the spelling of his birth name &quot;because I wanted a name people would remember&quot;.

==Career==
VelJohnson is known for playing police officers in films and on television. His early career included a brief appearance in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984) as a municipal corrections officer, and an appearance in &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; (1986) as a limo driver. VelJohnson played alongside Tom Hanks, as Det. David Sutton, in &quot;Turner &amp; Hooch&quot; (1989). He played an ambulance driver in &quot;Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins&quot; (1985) in which he was credited by the stage name Ivory Ocean.

VelJohnson had his breakthrough role as Sgt. Al Powell in the 1988 film &quot;Die Hard&quot;. VelJohnson was hired after Gene Hackman, originally hired to play the role, became unavailable, and producers decided to hire a relatively unknown actor for the part. He came from New York to California to film it for nine months, which was so long that he ended up residing in California permanently thereafter. He later reprised the character in the 1990 sequel &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;. VelJohnson again portrayed Sgt. Powell in the GameCube video game titled &quot;Die Hard: Vendetta&quot; in 2002.

In 1989, VelJohnson was cast as police officer and family patriarch Carl Winslow in the ABC (later CBS) sitcom &quot;Family Matters,&quot; alongside Jo Marie Payton, who played his wife Harriette Winslow. It was a spinoff of the popular show &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; on which he appeared only once, though Harriette appeared as a recurring guest star. He starred on the show until it ended in 1998. Since the end of &quot;Family Matters&quot;, VelJohnson has done mostly voice and guest star work. VelJohnson has made guest appearances in several TV shows, including &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Twice in a Lifetime&quot;, &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;Monk&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Eve&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;, &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;, &quot;The Parkers&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;, and &quot;Bones&quot;. He had a minor role in the 2002 film &quot;Like Mike&quot; and a recurring role as Pastor/Brother Haywood on &quot;Mike &amp; Molly&quot;. In 2007, he appeared in the short films &quot;Reverse&quot;, &quot;Nerve Endings&quot;, and &quot;Time Upon A Once&quot; which were made during the reality show &quot;On the Lot&quot;. In 2008, he appeared as the &quot;Sgt. Al Powell&quot; character from the &quot;Die Hard&quot; series in an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Chuck&quot; titled &quot;Chuck Versus the Santa Claus&quot;, as the cousin of Big Mike (Mark Christopher Lawrence). In 2010, VelJohnson started a recurring role as Principal, later Superintendent, Strickland on the Disney sitcom &quot;I&#x27;m in the Band&quot; and Funnyordie.com&#x27;s short HBO film titled &quot;Just 3 Boyz&quot; starring Tim Heidecker, Eric Wareheim, and Zach Galifianakis. He has appeared in the comedy film, &quot;The Formula&quot;, starring alongside Brandon Baker and Sasha Jackson. He played air traffic controller Bob Abbot in the 2012 film &quot;Air Collision&quot;.

In 2021, VelJohnson voiced Principal Winslow in the animated adaptation of the comic &quot;Invincible&quot;. In both the comic and the television series, the main character attends a high school named after the actor, and the character itself is named after his previous role of Carl Winslow from &quot;Family Matters&quot;. VelJohnson also voices several minor characters in the series. He later reprised his role as David Sutton on Disney&#x27;s &quot;Turner &amp; Hooch&quot;.

In January 2023, VelJohnson began appearing in advertisements for Progressive as &quot;TV Dad,&quot; a parody of his previous Carl Winslow role.

In September 2024, VelJohnson was announced as one of the celebrities competing on season 33 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He was partnered with Emma Slater and they finished in 10th place.

==Personal life==
As of 2009, VelJohnson had homes in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Los Angeles, and resided primarily in Oceanside, New York. He has never married and has no children.

<text>A backplate and wing (often abbreviated as BP&amp;W or BP/W) is a type of scuba harness with an attached buoyancy compensation device (BCD) which can be used to establish neutral buoyancy underwater and positive buoyancy at the surface. Unlike most other BCDs, the backplate and wing is a modular system, in that it consists of separable components. The core components of this system are:
* The backplate, a plate, usually made from stainless steel, sometimes aluminium or carbon fibre composite, which is held against the diver&#x27;s back by the harness, and to which the diver&#x27;s primary cylinder or cylinders are attached.
* A harness, which attaches the system to the diver, and may support other accessories.
* An inflatable buoyancy bladder known as a wing, between the backplate and the cylinder(s), used for adjusting the buoyancy of the diver when in the water.
* A set of cambands or cylinder bands, to hold the cylinder(s) in place.

==Function==
The backplate and wing combination is a modular form of scuba harness and back mounted buoyancy compensator used by scuba divers to support the diving cylinder and buoyancy compensator bladder on the diver&#x27;s back. It also provides attachment points for accessory equipment such as auxiliary scuba sets for decompression or bailout, lights, cutting tool and guideline reel.

==Configuration==

===Harness===
The basic harness comprises two lengths of 2&quot; (50mm) webbing: One is woven through the slots in the backplate to form closed shoulder loops and an open waist strap, with a weightbelt-type lever action buckle for securing the waist strap.

The second section of webbing forms a crotch strap, running from the bottom of the backplate, between the diver&#x27;s legs, and up to the waist strap, which would be passed through a loop at the front end of the crotch strap. This harness is sometimes referred to as a one-piece harness, due to the shoulder and waist straps being made from a single piece of webbing.

The harness is usually fitted with stainless steel D-rings secured by stainless steel &quot;sliders&quot;, small slotted plates which hold their position by friction. A loop of elastic cord is normally attached at the same place as the left shoulder D-ring, to secure the wing&#x27;s inflator hose.

This arrangement is extremely rugged, reliable and hard-wearing, and may be adjusted to fit different builds of diver by shortening the webbing used to tighten the harness, or installing a new longer section of webbing to loosen the harness. Once adjusted, some flexibility is still allowed by positioning the buckle, which can change the effective length of the waist strap depending on where it is secured.

The harness webbing can be replaced by the user with no special tools when the webbing wears through or is damaged, and other components can be easily replaced. This makes this style of harness very economical over the long term.

====Harness accessories====
*D-rings or a functional equivalent are usually fitted to the waistbelt, shoulder straps and crotch strap to secure stage cylinders, additional equipment, and clipping off demand valves, light heads, and submersible pressure gauges which are not currently being used. The number and position of these D-rings can be adjusted by the user, but there are a few positions which have become fairly standard.
**Left and right shoulder strap at roughly the height of the collar bone in front.
**Left hip just forward of the backplate.
**Crotch strap at the back and front. The front one is used for a tow-line when scootering
*Weight holders are available for integrated weight systems which can be slid over the waist belt.
*Canister lights can be carried on the waist belt. The standard position is on the right side.
*A small diver&#x27;s knife or cutting tool is commonly carried on the left side alongside the buckle.
*Backup lights are generally clipped to the shoulder D-rings and held against the shoulder straps by rubber bands cut from bicycle inner tubes. Other methods are possible, but the inner tubes work and are easily replaced when they wear out.

Many variations to this basic harness are used, and these may include:
* Differing number or positioning of D-rings.
* Shoulder straps that cross behind the diver&#x27;s neck.
* No crotch strap.
* An additional chest strap, which crosses the diver&#x27;s sternum.
* For divers who find it difficult to get the harness on or off, a buckle may be fitted to one or both of the shoulder straps. The left shoulder strap is particularly convenient because this is the side where most dry suits have the auto-dump valve, which tends to snag on the harness.
* Neoprene padding tubes may be used over the shoulder straps for comfort.

Some manufacturers offer alternative harnesses, often marketed as &quot;deluxe&quot; options, which may include the above variations.

Omitting the buoyancy bladder reduces the setup to a plain backpack harness if the breathing set needs to be used on land. However, the standard bent sheet-metal backplate is ergonomically unsuited to this function.

===Backplate===
The backplate is usually made from a single piece of stainless steel or anodised aluminium, bent along four lines to form a shallow channel running vertically down the center. The plate is about long and wide. There are two slots near each of the shoulders and hips, where the harness passes through, and another slot at the bottom of the plate where the crotch strap attaches. There is also one or more pairs of holes in the channel to be used for cylinder attachment; the holes of each pair are usually 11” apart.

A variation on this design uses another two parallel bends to form a shallow trough down the back of the central channel, which stabilises a single cylinder strapped to the centreline, with two pairs of slots for a pair of cambands..

Steel backplates are commonly used when the buoyancy of the diver&#x27;s other equipment (primarily cylinders and exposure protection) would need a weightbelt, as the negative buoyancy of the steel plate can replace some of this weight. Aluminium backplates are commonly used when the diver would not require a weightbelt (such as when wearing heavy steel cylinders) or when the mass of the backplate must be kept low for air travel. Backplates are occasionally made from other materials, including carbon fiber reinforced plastics, titanium, and ABS plastic.

Lightweight versions of the backplate are available with inessential areas cut away to reduce the weight. When taken to the extreme, a single cylinder is used as the longitudinal stiffener, and the backplate is reduced to a skeletal frame at the level of the waist belt, which stabilizes the cylinder against rolling on the diver&#x27;s back.

Backplate weights tend to range from around for stainless steel, for aluminium and for lighter materials.

===Wing===
The wing is an inflatable buoyancy bladder, similar to that in other varieties of BCD, except that it is not in or permanently attached to the harness part of a BCD. As with other BCDs, wings have an inflation valve on a corrugated hose, dump valve, and over pressure valve. Wings are usually oval (annular, doughnut or toroidal) or U-shaped (horseshoe), and are designed to wrap slightly around the diving cylinder(s) when inflated.

Wings are usually designed to be used with either a single diving cylinder or twin cylinders, although some manufacturers make wings that they recommend for both single and twin cylinder diving. Single-cylinder wings are most commonly oval-shaped and are relatively narrow, and twin-cylinder wings are more likely to be U-shaped and are wider.

Wings are available in a wide range of volumes, which can be described as:
*low volume, suitable for warm water where the diver does not use a high buoyancy dive suit, up to about lift, also sometimes called tropical wings, and used with a single cylinder.
*medium volume single tank wings, for use with more buoyant dive suits, with a buoyancy between about .
*high volume wings for twin tanks, with buoyancy of over about .

====Bungee wings====
Some wings, known as &quot;bungee wings&quot;, incorporate elastic cords to constrain the wing when it is less than completely full and accelerate air dumping. These wings usually have rubber bungee cords wrapping the bladder area, but some designs use an elasticised shell or cords along a bellows fold gusset. Arguments for and against are:
*For:
**That constricting the wing improves streamlining and ease of gas dumping.
*Against:
**That the bungee will increase streamlining only if the wing is inappropriately large.
**That the bungee would forcefully expel gas from the wing if there is a small puncture.
**That the bungee creates a rough surface, increasing drag; however, in reality it is extremely unlikely that any increase in drag would be significant.
**That drag is a minor concern, but entanglement is a real hazard; for this reason, many technical wreck and cave divers use &quot;bungee-less&quot; wings, as the elastic cords increase the risk of snagging.
**That the creases caused by the cords make it more difficult to dump the last of the air, and this may encourage divers to carry more weight than is strictly necessary, thus making good trim more difficult. 
Some manufacturers, such as OMS and Dive Rite make both and let the purchaser choose which style they prefer. The style which uses elastic only on the side gussets is more streamlined and smoother than the full wrap bungee style.

====Dual bladder wings====
Another variety, the &quot;&quot;, contains a second, redundant bladder and inflation assembly, with the second bladder being intended for use if the primary bladder fails, either through a puncture, or through an inflation valve failing. Some technical divers may choose a dual bladder wing to have backup redundancy if the primary bladder fails. Detractors of this arrangement point out that if the extra bladder is inadvertently inflated, the diver may not realise that this has occurred, and it may result in an uncontrolled buoyant ascent, with a risk of fatal injury. This risk may be reduced by having only oral inflation for the backup wing, or requiring the same low pressure inflator hose to be used for both wings, and having the backup bladder inflation on the opposite side to the primary bladder. This makes it necessary to disconnect the hose and reconnect to the other bladder to use the low pressure inflator for the backup wing, and it is not possible for a leaky inflation valve to fill the backup wing without the diver&#x27;s knowledge.

The wing may be a single or double skin unit. A single skin wing uses the same material for structure and holding the air, while a double skin arrangement uses an airtight bladder in a structural casing of strong but porous textile. Single skin construction is simpler, and usually uses RF welding to make the seams. These bladders are usually lighter and dry out more quickly than double skin wings, but if the bladder is punctured, a new bladder is relatively easily fitted to a double skin wing, while repair of the single skin bladder may not be practicable, depending on material and construction details, and the location and extent of the damage. Single skin wings are also easier to decontaminate, particularly if the outer surface is smooth. Single skin wings may use a bellows fold gusset to increase inflatable volume while retaining a relatively compact outline. This can reduce drag while swimming when the bladder is deflated.
===Cylinder attachment===
When a backplate is used with a single cylinder, a single tank adapter, or STA, is usually used. The STA is a small metal structure that bolts onto the backplate on the outside of the wings, contains two camstraps, and accommodates the cylinder. Use of a single tank adaptor slightly increases the profile height of the assembly and may affect the centre of gravity which may affect trim. In some cases the increase in height may be undesirable.

In some instances, the STA may be omitted, and the camstraps threaded through the wing and backplate. In these cases, the wing will contain a built-in STA in the form of two rods or pads which stabilise the cylinder, or the backplate may be made with a slight channel in the central ridge to hold the single cylinder.

Twin cylinders are usually attached to the backplate via bolts, passing through the cylinder bands, and secured by nuts in the central channel of the backplate. An alternative is to use two sets of camstraps and extra slots in the backplate and wing. This arrangement will allow convenient attachment of independent cylinders of almost any size without use of cylinder bands.

Some rebreather divers fit backplates to their rebreathers. The exact method of attachment varies between users and rebreather models, and may include modification to the rebreather or using a customised backplate. Some rebreathers are designed specifically for use with backplates.
===Ancillary equipment===
The backplate and wing is a system, however it does facilitate addition of other equipment. Ancillary equipment, commonly attached to the backplate and wing includes:
* Sling mounted stage cylinders or decompression cylinders.
* &quot;Tow behind&quot; diver propulsion vehicles, which use a tow-cord, attaching to the crotch strap D-ring of the harness.
* Pockets.
* Cutting tool sheath.
* Dive lights and dive light battery canisters.
* Some or all of the diver&#x27;s ballast weights may be bolted to the plate, clipped to the harness webbing, or strapped to the cylinder (tank weights). A v-weight, keel weight or p-weight, trim weights or clip-on weights may be used.

Some of this equipment is difficult to attach to other styles of BCD.

===Hogarthian configuration===

The Hogarthian scuba configuration or &quot;Hogarthian rig&quot; is a specific version of the backplate and wing arrangement developed largely by William Hogarth Main and other members of the Woodville Karst Plain Project as particularly suited to the diving conditions of the Florida caves, and adopted by the DIR scuba movement as an all-purpose scuba configuration.

==Comparison with alternative equipment==
The predominant type of BCD currently used in recreational diving is the jacket style BCD. The backplate and wing differs from the jacket style primarily in the way that the functions required of a BCD (attachment to diver, buoyancy control and attachment to cylinder(s)) are performed by distinct components, rather than a single unit. The most significant effects of this division are shifting the buoyancy bladder from the diver&#x27;s chest to their back and the modularity of the system, allowing buoyancy cells, harnesses, and plates to be interchanged as needed. The buoyancy of a backplate is often significantly negative, especially when the plate is made from stainless steel, and so can replace some of the weight that would otherwise be worn on a weightbelt. Ancillary features that would often be present in jacket BCDs, such as pockets or weight integration, are not found in the core system of a backplate and wing, but can be added as additional components if desired.

Other types of BCD exist which more resemble backplate and wing BCD. Back-inflation BCDs are similar in construction to jacket BCDs, except for where the buoyancy cell is. In a back-inflation BCD, as with a backplate and wing, the cell is behind the diver&#x27;s back, and is of similar shape to a wing, but a back-inflation BCD usually does not have the modularity of a backplate and wing, although some models let buoyancy cells be substituted.

Softpack BCDs are another style closer still to backplate and wing BCDs. Softpacks, like backplates, are designed to be modular, and are often marketed towards technical divers. A softpack consists of a padded semi-rigid section that serves that same purpose as a backplate, and uses a harness that is either replaceable, like a backplate harness, or permanently fixed. Softpacks may be used with the same models of wings that are used with backplates. The primary differences between these and backplates are the lack of a rigid plate and possible non-separability of the softpack and harness. The relatively low density of the softpack usually necessitates more ballast weight.

A minimalist form of softpack harness is a set of webbing straps much like that of the backplate, but with a webbing strap instead of the plate. This strap may be formed by stitching or threading through sliders a double layer of webbing with slots between the layers which the cambands pass through, and the wing is sandwiched between harness and cylinder. There is no need for a plate, as the cylinder forms the rigid part of the assembly. This arrangement is best suited to single cylinders, and can be made very compact and light for travelling. In some cases a stabiliser plate may be included at the base of the vertical strap, and the harness shoulder and waistband straps thread through this as is done on the standard backplate.


==History== 

Early scuba sets were simply a set of harness straps connected to a cylinder or manifolded group of cylinders, with a regulator connected to the cylinder valve. This works quite satisfactorily for twin and triple sets, which are inherently quite stable on the back, and have little tendency to roll from side to side.

Florida cave diver Greg Flanagan has been credited with inventing a backplate in 1979 to prevent twin cylinders from shifting during a dive, but it is possible that similar systems were in use earlier.

A simple backplate solved the rolling problem, and was often developed into a more ergonomically formed metal, fibreglass, or later, blow-moulded plastic backplate. These usually used simple webbing harness, and were cheap, reliable, and easily repaired. They were usually dedicated to the cylinder, but later versions allowed quick release and attachment of other cylinders. As stabiliser jacket buoyancy compensators became popular, the harness system was integrated with the jacket structure, to simplify the structure and make it easier to use and more comfortable. Eventually most harness systems became more complex and less easy to repair by the user. They also became more bulky over the chest area than the original simple harness systems.

Cave divers found that the bulkiness of the stabiliser jackets over the front and sides of the torso got in the way of suspending additional cylinders at their sides for bailout and decompression gases.

The traditional backplate and wing harness has the benefit of reduced points of failure(due to it usually being a single piece of webbing with the front locking buckle the only break), ability to modify to personal requirements and stronger, safer, points for carrying equipment, and if needed to be attached to in a rescue scenario. Being able to use the same harness to adapt as needed through one&#x27;s diving career is an added advantage (single tank, dual, rebreather etc) can make it a more economical approach also. Routine maintenance and replacement of damaged components is simple.

<text>Donna Morrissey (born January 13, 1956) is a Canadian author.

At age 16, Morrissey left her birthplace of The Beaches, a small outport on the west coast of Newfoundland. She lived in various places in Canada before returning to St. John&#x27;s, where she studied at Memorial University and obtained a Bachelor of Social Work and a diploma in adult education. Morrissey now lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Morrissey has written six national best sellers and prize-winning novels — &quot;Kit&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;Downhill Chance&quot;, &quot;Sylvanus Now&quot;, &quot;What They Wanted&quot;, &quot;The Deception of Livvy Higgs&quot;, and &quot;The Fortunate Brother&quot; — as well as one Gemini-nominated screenplay. In 2021 She published a memoir, &quot;Pluck: A Memoir of a Newfoundland Childhood and the Raucous, Terrible, Amazing Journey to Becoming a Novelist&quot;.

Morrissey defended Frank Parker Day&#x27;s novel &quot;Rockbound&quot; in &quot;Canada Reads 2005&quot;. &quot;Rockbound&quot; eventually won the competition. In the 2007 edition of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, an &quot;all-star&quot; competition pitting the five winning advocates from previous years against each other, Morrissey returned to champion Anosh Irani&#x27;s novel &quot;The Song of Kahunsha&quot;.

Morrissey had a double mastectomy due to breast cancer.

<text>Timothy Adam Hudson (born July 14, 1975), nicknamed &quot;Huddy&quot;, is an American former professional baseball pitcher of Major League Baseball (MLB). After spending his college years at Chattahoochee Valley Community College and Auburn University, Hudson played in the major leagues for the Oakland Athletics (1999–2004), the Atlanta Braves (2005–13), and the San Francisco Giants (2014–15). With the Giants, he won the 2014 World Series over the Kansas City Royals. He is now the varsity head coach for the Lee-Scott Academy baseball team, located in Auburn, Alabama.

During his 17-season career, Hudson established himself as one of baseball&#x27;s most consistent pitchers and until 2014 had never had a season where he suffered more losses than wins. Hudson was also named an All-Star four times: twice with Oakland, once with Atlanta, and once with San Francisco.

Before retiring in 2015, Hudson was the active Major League pitcher with the most wins and one of four active pitchers with at least 200 career wins. With a win against the Oakland A&#x27;s on July 26, 2015, he has won a game against every team in the majors, the 15th pitcher to do so. Hudson is one of 21 pitchers in Major League history to win at least 200 games, strike out at least 2,000 batters and have a winning percentage above .600. Of those 21, 14 are in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Timothy Adam Hudson was born on July 14, 1975, in Columbus, Georgia. Hudson attended Glenwood School in Phenix City, Alabama where in his senior season he led the team to the 1993 AISA state championship. He finished his high school career with a 12–1 record and a 1.78 ERA. Despite his record, Hudson was considered undersized by scouts at 6&#x27;0&quot; tall and 160 pounds and was not offered a scholarship to a major college. Hudson decided to attend a local two-year college, Chattahoochee Valley Community College (CVCC).

==College career==
In , his freshman year at CVCC, he earned First-team All American honors while leading his team to the AJCCC Division II championship. He also led CVCC team in batting average (.385), home runs (9), RBI (42), wins (10–2), strikeouts (76), and was second on the team with a 2.76 ERA. As a sophomore, he was named Second-team All American and set a school and conference record with 117 strikeouts which also led the nation. As a hitter, Hudson batted .345 with five home runs, and 29 RBI. His sophomore season ERA of 1.95 was the team and conference best.

Prior to his junior year, Hudson transferred to Auburn University where he would play two seasons. He is still at or near the top of many school records. In , he played all 65 games for the Tigers while both pitching and playing outfield. That season, he hit .396 with 18 home runs and 95 RBI. As a pitcher, he finished 15–2 with a 2.97 ERA to earn SEC Player of the Year and consensus All-American honors. Hudson was the first player to be named First Team All-SEC at two positions (P,OF) in the same year. He was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the sixth round of the 1997 amateur draft.

==Professional career==

===Drafts and minor leagues===
Hudson was drafted by the Oakland Athletics twice, in the 35th round of the 1994 MLB Draft and again in the 6th round of the 1997 MLB draft, signing in 1997.

===Oakland Athletics (1999–2004)===
Hudson made his Major League debut with a five inning start on June 8, 1999, against the San Diego Padres, where he allowed three earned runs in a game the Athletics eventually lost 5–3. He recorded his first career win in his next start, on June 13 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He allowed only one run in seven innings of the 9–3 victory.
In his rookie season, Hudson had an 11–2 mark and finished 5th in the AL Rookie of the Year vote. He became a member of Oakland&#x27;s so-called &quot;Big Three&quot;, along with left-handed pitchers Mark Mulder and Barry Zito. In 2000, he posted a career-high 20 victories along with a 4.14 ERA for Oakland. He finished second in AL Cy Young Award voting behind Pedro Martínez. Over the course of the next three seasons, Hudson&#x27;s records were 18-9 in 2001, 15–9 in 2002 and 16–7 in 2003 with a career low 2.70 ERA. In 2004, Hudson failed to pitch 30 games due to injury. He went 12–6 in 27 starts. Hudson&#x27;s record while with the A&#x27;s was 92–39, and an ERA of 3.30.

===Atlanta Braves (2005–2013)===
Before the season, Hudson was traded to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for Charles Thomas, Dan Meyer, and Juan Cruz. On August 6, 2005, Hudson won his 100th career game, defeating the St. Louis Cardinals 8–1.

In January , Hudson was named to the Team USA roster for the 2006 World Baseball Classic.

His second season with the Braves was disappointing. He posted career-highs in losses (12) and ERA (4.86) in 2006. He returned to his earlier form in however, finishing with a 16–10 record and a 3.33 ERA. He was in the midst of a nine-game winning streak, the second of his career, at one point in the season. Hudson struck out a career-high 13 batters on April 25 against the Florida Marlins.

On April 29, 2007, both Hudson&#x27;s grandmother and St. Louis Cardinals relief pitcher Josh Hancock, his college teammate at Auburn, died. He drew his grandmother&#x27;s initials on the pitcher&#x27;s mound before his next start, and wore them on his spikes. He also sewed Hancock&#x27;s initials (JH) on his jersey. He pitched eight innings, giving up two earned runs against the Philadelphia Phillies. He did not get a decision, but the Braves ultimately won, 5–2.

Hudson is one of only seven ballplayers who pitched in the NL in 2007 who won at least 12 games in each year from 2004 to 2007, the others being Carlos Zambrano, Greg Maddux, Roy Oswalt, Jason Marquis, Derek Lowe, and Jeff Suppan.

On August 2, 2008, Hudson revealed that he would undergo Tommy John ligament transplant surgery on his pitching elbow, and missed the remainder of the 2008 season. He started the season on the 60-day DL, and did not play prior to the All Star break. On July 2, 2009, he threw a 90-pitch bullpen session and Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox said: &quot;He&#x27;s ready to go. ... He&#x27;s really come along. He&#x27;s got major-league stuff right now, his normal stuff.&quot; But Cox added that the Braves would not rush the timetable on Hudson&#x27;s return, which was scheduled for mid- to late-August. Hudson&#x27;s first minor-league rehab start was tentatively scheduled for July 19 at Class A Myrtle Beach. After completing several minor league rehab sessions, Hudson returned to the Atlanta Braves starting pitching rotation on September 1, 2009. He gave up only two runs and earned his first win of the 2009 season.
On November 12, 2009, Hudson signed a $28 million, three-year extension with the Braves with a $9 million option for a fourth year. On August 28, 2010, against the Florida Marlins, Hudson set a career high in strikeouts with 13.

On October 5, 2010, Hudson was awarded the 2010 NL Comeback Player of the Year Award.

On June 20, 2011, in Atlanta, Hudson hit his second career home run, a two-run shot which accounted for the only scoring in a 2–0 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. On the same day, he got his 1,600th strikeout in the top of the fifth inning against J. P. Arencibia. On July 15, 2011, Hudson was the winning pitcher in the Braves&#x27; 10,000th win in franchise history.

Hudson went 16–7 with a 3.62 ERA in 2012. On October 30, 2012, Hudson had his $9 million option exercised by the Braves.

On April 30, 2013, Hudson became the 113th major league pitcher to reach 200 wins, with an 8–1 victory over the Washington Nationals at Turner Field. Hudson went seven innings, giving up only three hits and one run while recording six strikeouts and two walks. Hudson also went 2-for-3 at the plate with a double and a home run. On July 24, 2013, Hudson was pitching a four-hit shutout against the New York Mets when Eric Young, Jr., who was trying to beat a throw to first base, accidentally stepped on Hudson&#x27;s leg above the ankle. This resulted in an ankle fracture that ended Hudson&#x27;s 2013 season. After the season, Hudson became a free agent. His record with the Braves was 113–72 with an ERA of 3.56.

===San Francisco Giants (2014–2015)===

On November 18, 2013, Hudson agreed to a two-year, $23 million contract with the San Francisco Giants.
Hudson set a franchise record by pitching innings in the season before issuing a walk. The streak was snapped on April 25 when he walked Carlos Santana. Hudson posted at the time a Major League-best and leading 1.81 ERA in his first 13 starts with the Giants, the lowest in 104 years in the 133-year history of the franchise. In his first year with the Giants, he was selected to participate in the All-Star Game. Accomplishing this feat, he has made the All-Star team at least once with every team he has pitched for. On August 27, 2014, in a 4–2 team win over the Colorado Rockies at Oracle Park (then called AT&amp;T Park), Hudson recorded his 2,000th career strikeout. Hudson started game 2 of the 2014 NLDS, a game that went 18 innings; Hudson also started the only other postseason game to go longer than 16 innings while on the Braves in 2005. On October 29, Hudson became the oldest pitcher to start Game 7 of the World Series. The Giants went on to win the game, 3–2, and the series, 4–3, over the Kansas City Royals, giving Hudson the first and only World Series ring of his 16-year career.

Prior to the 2015 season, Hudson stated it would likely be his last. Following a 4–3 win against the Oakland Athletics on July 26, 2015, Hudson became the 15th pitcher in MLB history to register at least one win against all 30 current teams. On September 26, 2015, Hudson started against Zito and the Athletics in a matchup that was arranged as a tribute to the A&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot; of the early 2000s. Both pitchers received lengthy standing ovations from the sold-out Oakland Coliseum crowd (which included the third Big Three member, Mulder) upon leaving the game.

On October 1 at AT&amp;T Park, Hudson started his last career Major League game. Giants manager Bruce Bochy made a pitching change, allowing Hudson to receive a standing ovation from his family, friends, and Giants announcers, executives, and fans as he walked off the mound. As he reached the dugout steps, he was greeted and embraced by all of his teammates and coaches outside and inside of it. On October 3 at AT&amp;T Park, during Fan Appreciation Weekend, the Giants honored Hudson with a pregame ceremony surrounded by his family, friends, Giants teammates, coaches, and executives. The event was broadcast live on local television on Comcast SportsNet Bay Area, where Giants sportscaster Jon Miller served as MC. The ceremony included a taped video message from his Hall of Fame Braves manager Bobby Cox, speeches from president and chief executive officer Larry Baer, Bochy, and starting rotation mates Jake Peavy and Madison Bumgarner, before Hudson emotionally addressed the crowd.

==Scouting report==
Hudson was a sinkerballer, using that pitch about half the time and at a speed of 87–91 mph. His next-most used pitch was a cutter at 84–87. He expanded his repertoire to left-handers with a curveball (75–77) and splitter (78–81). He also had a four-seam fastball (88–91 mph). His favored pitch with two strikes to right-handed hitters was his cutter, while he stayed with the sinker to lefties.

<text>Sherraine Schalm, formerly Sherraine Schalm-MacKay (born June 21, 1975), is a former top-ranked Canadian Olympic épée fencer. She is a World Cup medal winner, elementary school teacher and author. She is a graduate of the University of Ottawa. At the 2005 World Fencing Championships she won a bronze medal in the individual épée event, becoming the first Canadian to ever win a World Championships medal in the sport. The next season, in 2005–06, she won the overall World Cup title.

Born in Brooks, Alberta, Schalm has earned the best ever results for any Canadian woman fencer at the world championships, the Olympic Games and is a four-time medallist at the Pan American Games. She has competed at four Summer Olympics. In 2000 she finished 19th in the individual event. In 2004 she finished 18th in the individual event, and fourth in the team event.

Schalm published a memoir, &quot;Running With Swords&quot; (under the name Sherraine MacKay), in 2005.

In the 2008 Olympic Games, Schalm was widely expected to challenge for a medal, but lost in the second round. She was seeded 9th.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics, she reached the last 32 but lost to South Korean fencer Shin A-lam.

She retired in 2013.

==Books==

Sherraine has also won two individual world championship medals at the senior level. The four-time Olympian from Brooks, Alta., captured Canada&#x27;s first world championship fencing medal – a bronze in individual épée in 2005. She topped that in 2009, claiming a silver.

<text>GNU libiberty is a software library with a collection of subroutines used by various GNU programs. The library is now a decommissioned GNU package.

It was originally intended to be a sort of standard cross-platform library, thus enabling it to be linked (using the usual Unix library form) by just passing &quot;-liberty&quot; to the compiler. The contents consisted of a variety of useful functions. However, the development of standards for C and POSIX took away some of the impetus for this, and libiberty came to be used primarily as a support library for the GNU toolchain. It still contains a minimal set of functions that are either GNU extensions or occasionally unimplemented parts of the standard.

Copies of libiberty are distributed with gcc, gdb, and the binutils. libiberty is not otherwise versioned or released separately.

One important piece of libiberty functionality is a demangler for C++ and D, included so that it is available to both binutils and GDB.

The name is a pun or word play on the word &quot;liberty&quot;. On Unix-like operating systems, library files are always named &quot;lib&quot; + the name of the library. But when they are linked to with a C compiler command (codice_1, codice_2, etc.), the command line flag specifying the library is codice_3 followed by the part of the library name after &quot;lib&quot;. In libiberty&#x27;s case it therefore becomes codice_4.

<text>Darius Creston McCrary (born May 1, 1976) is an American actor, singer and producer. McCrary is known for his role as Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Winslow, the oldest child of Carl and Harriette Winslow on the ABC/CBS television sitcom &quot;Family Matters&quot;, which ran from 1989–1998.

He also played Scam in the 1987 comedy film &quot;Big Shots&quot;, which was his film debut. He provided the voice of Jazz in &quot;Transformers&quot; (2007). From December 2009 to October 2011, he portrayed photographer Malcolm Winters on the CBS daytime drama &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

==Early life and career==
McCrary began his career as a child actor and made his film debut in the 1987 comedy &quot;Big Shots&quot;. He also appeared in guest spots in episodic television and had a role in the 1988 film &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; before landing the role of Eddie Winslow in &quot;Family Matters&quot; the following year. After &quot;Family Matters&quot; ended its run in 1998, McCrary co-starred in the short-lived UPN series &quot;Freedom&quot;. In 2000, he had a lead role as Tommy in &quot;Something to Sing About&quot;, a Christian drama produced by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. In 2001, he appeared in &quot;15 Minutes&quot; opposite Robert De Niro and &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, with Whoopi Goldberg.

In April and May 2006, McCrary reunited with his &quot;Family Matters&quot; co-star Kellie Shanygne Williams as Jamal on UPN&#x27;s &quot;Eve&quot; for two episodes. In 2007, he was the voice of Jazz in the movie &quot;Transformers&quot;. In 2009, he voiced Tarix in &quot;&quot;. McCrary also had film roles in &quot;Next Day Air&quot;, &quot;Saw VI&quot;, and in national stage play productions such as &quot;The Maintenance Man&quot;. That December, he joined the cast of the CBS daytime drama &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. McCrary portrayed Malcolm Winters, a role originated by Shemar Moore. Joined on the series by his former &quot;Family Matters&quot; co-star Bryton James (né McClure), McCrary left &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in October 2011. McCrary&#x27;s first album was also released the same year.

On January 6, 2010, McCrary appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;I Get That a Lot&quot; on CBS. He was pumping gas, and Paris Hilton was pretending to be a clerk at the gas station. She recognized him and asked for his autograph. He thought it was her and after she confessed who she was, he said he thought she was doing community service. McCrary later starred in the stage play &quot;In-Laws From Hell&quot; written, directed, and produced by Andrionna L. Williams.

== Personal life ==
McCrary is the founder of Fathers Care, a non-profit organization under the McCrary Foundation umbrella, started by his father, aunts and uncles, cousins also known as The McCrarys.

In 2015, he was arrested and held in custody for failure to pay child support, but was released after two hours when he paid the full $5,500 in back support owed. On November 27, 2023, McCrary was arrested a second time on felony charges of failure to pay child support of over $52,000 as of March 2019. He pleaded not guilty, and his bond was set at $13,197.01, according to court documents.

<text>Hadar or Hadar Formation (also spelled &quot;Qad daqar&quot;, &quot;Qadaqar&quot;; Afar &quot;white [&quot;qidi&quot;] stream [&quot;daqar&quot;]&quot;) is a paleontological fossil site located in Mille district, Administrative Zone 1 of the Afar Region, Ethiopia, 15 km upstream (west) of the A1 road&#x27;s bridge across the Awash River (Adayitu kebele).

It is situated on the southern edge of the Afar Triangle (part of East Africa&#x27;s Great Rift Valley), along the left banks of the Awash River, between two minor tributaries, the eponymous Kada Hadar and the Kada Gona. In 1972, Taieb organized a small exploratory reconnaissance of the Afar region to investigate more paleontological finds there. After six weeks of exploration, the party focused on the Hadar site.

The site has yielded some of the most well-known hominin fossils, including &quot;Lucy&quot;. These hominin fossils range in age from approximately 3.42 to 2.90 million years ago. These finds give us a greater understanding of hominin evolution during this period.

It is postulated that the specimens in the region were deposited by way of a large river system with associated crevasse channels/splays, deltas, and distributary channels, as well as periodic transgressions of paleolake Hadar located east of the research area (Aronson and Taieb, 1981, Tiercelin, 1986, Campisano and Feibel, in press) possibly related to geological activity or climatic cycles in at least the Kada Hadar Member (Yemane et al., 1996, Yemane, 1997, Campisano and Feibel, in press).&quot;

According to Jon Kalb, early maps show caravan routes passing within 10 to 15 km of Hadar but not through it. The British explorer L.M. Nesbitt passed 15 km west of Hadar in 1928.
== Geology ==

The region&#x27;s rocks consist mainly of mudstones, siltstones, fine-grained sandstones and volcanic tuffs. The region of Hadar has been divided into four geologic members — Basal (~3.8–3.42 Ma), Sidi Hakoma (~3.42–3.26 Ma), Denen Dora (~3.26–3.2 Ma), and Kada Hadar (&lt;~3.2 Ma)—with three tuffs (Sidi Hakoma Tuff [SHT], Triple Tuff [TT] and Kada Hadar Tuff [KHT]) separating the four members.

The Sidi Hakoma member tends towards high rainfall and low seasonality. The overlying Denan Dora Member was a grassland habitat. Finally, the Kada Hadar Member was an even more open and arid habitat, as seen in the high abundance of antilopines, which frequent these types of terrains.

==Paleontology==
The first paleo-geological explorations of the Hadar area were conducted by Maurice Taieb. He found Hadar in December 1970 by following the Ledi River, which originates in the highlands north of Bati to empty into the Awash River. Taieb recovered several fossils in the area and led a party back to Hadar in May 1972. In October 1973, 16 individuals with the International Afar Research Expedition (IARE) arrived at Hadar and camped there for two months during which the first hominin fossil was found. (Taieb claims in his 1985 book &quot;Sur la Terre des premiers Hommes&quot; to have discovered the Hadar fields in 1968, but Kalb argues that claim to be incorrect.) The IARE party examined a series of sedimentary layers called the Hadar Formation, which was dated to the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene epochs (3.5 to 2.3 million years ago).

=== Discovery of Lucy ===

The anthropologist Donald Johanson, a member of the 1973 expedition to Hadar, returned the next year and discovered the fossil hominin &quot;Lucy&quot; in the late fall of 1974. He spotted a right proximal ulna in a gully, followed by an occipital bone, a femur, some ribs, a pelvis, and a lower jaw. Within two weeks, nearly 40% of the hominoid skeleton had been identified and cataloged. Lucy is the most famous fossil to have been found at Hadar. Lucy is among the oldest hominin fossils ever discovered and was later given the taxonomic classification &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot;. (The name &#x27;Lucy&#x27; was inspired by the song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; by The Beatles, which happened to be playing on the radio at base camp.)

=== Specimens and inferences ===

In 1975, Donald Johanson made another discovery at a nearby site in Hadar: 216 specimens from approximately 17 individuals, most likely related and varying in age, called AL 333 (colloquially referred to as the &quot;First Family&quot;).

About thirty years later in nearby Dikika, another &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; fossil skeleton was found in a separate outcrop of the Hadar Formation across the Awash River from Hadar. The skeleton is of a three-year-old girl later named &quot;Selam,&quot; which means peace in Amharic Ethiopian languages.

In 1973 and 1974 when the first anatomical discoveries were made, their size and shape pointed towards a variety of taxa, but further research has confirmed that only one hominin taxon is present here. The first find there was a fossil knee joint estimated to date from 3.4 million years ago. Since then, the Hadar research area has yielded 370 specimens of &quot;A. afarensis&quot;, one specimen of &quot;Homo&quot;, and 7571 additional vertebrate specimens.

The specimens recovered display a variety of different primitive cranial post features, which indicate &quot;A. afarensis&quot; is distinct from other species of &quot;Australopithecus&quot;: small cranial capacity, palate similar to African apes (parallel tooth rows, shallow, long from front to back, narrow from side to side), primitive occipital, basal cranium anatomy, high frequency of unicuspid third premolars, prognathic face, and primitive mandibular anatomy. Postcranially, the pelvis, knee, ankle, and foot indicate habitual, terrestrial bipedalism, but ape-like curved finger and foot bones are retained ancestral ape-like features.

==Paleofauna==
Although Australopithecus is well-known for its discovery since the 1970s, other specimens from the Hadar Formation contain several fossil remains of artiodactyls, perissodactyls, carnivorans, proboscideans, and other African species that are well preserved. The bovids found in the formation included the Aepycerotini (&quot;Aepyceros&quot;), Alcelaphini (&quot;Damalborea&quot; and &quot;Parmularius&quot;), Antilopini (&quot;Gazella&quot;), Bovini (&quot;Ugandax&quot; and &quot;Pelorovis&quot;[?]), Caprini (&quot;Budorcas&quot;), Cephalophini, Hippotragini (&quot;Oryx&quot;), Neotragini (&quot;Raphicerus&quot;[?] and &quot;Madoqua&quot;), Reduncini (&quot;Kobus&quot;), and Tragelaphini (&quot;Tragelaphus&quot;). Artiodactyls outside the bovid family were present within the formation as well, namely the giraffids (&quot;Giraffa&quot; and &quot;Sivatherium&quot;), Hippopotamidae (&quot;Hippopotamus&quot;), and suids (&quot;Kolpochoerus&quot;, &quot;Notochoerus&quot;, and &quot;Nyanzachoerus&quot;). While a definitive list of carnivorans found within the Hadar Formation has yet to be compiled, confirmed genera that were found within the Hadar Formation include canids (&quot;Canis&quot; and &quot;Nyctereutes&quot;), felids (&quot;Dinofelis&quot;, &quot;Leptailurus&quot;, &quot;Felis&quot;, &quot;Homotherium&quot;, and &quot;Panthera&quot;), hyaenids (&quot;Chasmaporthetes&quot;, &quot;Ikelohyaena&quot;, &quot;Crocuta&quot;, &quot;Hyaena&quot;, and cf.&quot; Pliocrocuta&quot;), herpestids (&quot;Herpestes&quot; and cf. &quot;Helogale&quot;), mustelids (&quot;Mellivora&quot;, &quot;Enhydriodon&quot;, and cf. &quot;Poecilogale&quot;), and the viverrid (cf. &quot;Civettictis&quot;). Mammals within the formation outside the artiodactyl and carnivoran families include a bat (indeterminate), the leporid (&quot;Lepus&quot;), the equid (&quot;Eurygnathohippus&quot;), rhinoceroses (&quot;Ceratotherium&quot; and &quot;Diceros&quot;), old world primates (&quot;Parapapio&quot;, &quot;Theropithecus&quot;, and &quot;Cercopithecoides&quot;), proboscideans (the deinothere &quot;Deinotherium&quot; and elephants &quot;Elephas&quot;, &quot;Loxodonta&quot;, and &quot;Mammuthus&quot;) old world porcupines (&quot;Hystrix&quot; and &quot;Xenohystrix&quot;), murid rodents (&quot;Gerbilliscus&quot;, &quot;Acomys&quot;, &quot;Golunda&quot;, &quot;Oenomys&quot;, &quot;Praomys&quot;, &quot;Saidomys&quot;, &quot;Millardia&quot;, and &quot;Mus&quot;), the spalacid &quot;Tachyoryctes&quot;, a squirrel indet., and an aardvark species. Taxons within other classes are present within the Hadar Formation as well, such as birds (&quot;Plectropterus&quot;, &quot;Balearica&quot;, &quot;Anhinga&quot;, and &quot;Struthio&quot;) and reptiles (&quot;Crocodylus&quot;, &quot;Python&quot;, &quot;Varanus&quot;, and &quot;Bitis&quot;).

<doc id="1260976" wikidata="Q3272933" url="?curid=1260976" title="Edward Seidensticker">
<text>Edward George Seidensticker (February 11, 1921 – August 26, 2007) was a noted post-World War II American scholar, historian, and preeminent translator of classical and contemporary Japanese literature. His English translation of the epic &quot;The Tale of Genji,&quot; published in 1976, was especially well received critically and is counted among the preferred modern translations.

Seidensticker is closely associated with the work of three major Japanese writers of the 20th century: Yasunari Kawabata, Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki, and Yukio Mishima. His landmark translations of novels by Kawabata, in particular &quot;Snow Country&quot; (1956) and &quot;Thousand Cranes&quot; (1958), led, in part, to Kawabata being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1968.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Seidensticker was born in 1921 on an isolated farmstead near Castle Rock, Colorado. His father, also named Edward G. Seidensticker, was the owner of a modest ranch that struggled financially during the 1920s and early 1930s. His mother, Mary E. Seidensticker (née Dillon), was a homemaker. Seidensticker was raised Catholic and was of German, English and Irish heritage. By high school, cognizant that he was neither athletic nor mechanically adept, he began to slip away during spare time to read Dickens and Thackeray, among others. He found Tolstoy most to his liking, the works of Mark Twain the least. He was one of the only two students in his graduating class at Douglas County High School to go off to college, the other being his older brother, William.

Seidensticker wanted to attend an East Coast university, but because of his family&#x27;s financial situation he grudgingly enrolled in the University of Colorado at Boulder. It was assumed that he would study law, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and several uncles, but he chose economics, then switched to English, a choice that displeased his family. In June 1942, he graduated with a degree in English.

===U.S. Navy Japanese Language School===
As the 1940s unfolded, the U.S. Navy began to expand its Japanese Language School, then located at the University of California at Berkeley. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, an invitation was issued to shift the school to the University of Colorado. The navy was amenable because the forced relocation of citizens and residents of Japanese ancestry was underway along the West Coast, and most of the program&#x27;s instructors were in danger of being caught up in the expanding net. By the middle of 1942, the school had completed its move to Colorado. Among those who came east to Boulder with the program was student Donald Keene. Seidensticker, who had been seeking a way to manage through the war without being drafted, saw the Japanese Language School as a solution. He traveled to Washington, D.C. for a school-admittance interview, the first time he had been east of Chicago, and was accepted. Upon completion of the 14-month intensive program, he was able to read a Japanese language newspaper, albeit with some difficulty. The &quot;Boulder Boys,&quot; as the men who attended the language school were fondly called (a handful of women later joined the program as well), were given the choice of becoming officers in the Navy or Marine Corps. Seidensticker selected the Marines due to an abundance of &quot;boyish romanticism.&quot;

===War years===
Seidensticker received basic training with the Marines in North Carolina, after which he was shifted to Camp Pendleton on the West Coast. It was in California that he first encountered Japanese prisoners of war, with whom he was to practice his Japanese. Late in 1944 he and his language-officer colleagues were transferred to the Hawaiian Islands and Pearl Harbor. They were given duties to translate captured documents and to interrogate prisoners of war, a task Seidensticker found increasingly distasteful. In February 1945, Seidensticker was boarded on a ship bound for Iwo Jima. He was not among the first waves of troops to land during the battle, but before long, found himself on the beach &quot;loaded down with dictionaries.&quot; By then the gunfire had ceased as the Japanese had retreated north to bunkers and caves. Later, he reminisced in his memoirs that while he may have been in danger a few times, he had little awareness of being afraid. Near the end of his deployment, after the island had been declared &quot;secure,&quot; he climbed Mount Suribachi, the site of Joe Rosenthal&#x27;s iconic flag-raising photograph. He was then rotated back to Hawaii. During that stay, the atomic bombs were dropped and the war with Japan came to an end. Although Seidensticker was deeply unsettled by the dropping of the bomb, he approved of Truman&#x27;s decision. In his memoirs, he noted, &quot;Had I been at Harry&#x27;s Desk, I would have made the decision he made. The important things were to get the war over and to save lives; and that more lives, American and Japanese, were saved by the bombing than were destroyed by it seems the next thing to certain.&quot;

===Occupation of Japan and foreign service===
About a month after General Douglas MacArthur arrived in Tokyo to assume control of Japan, Seidensticker landed with the Marines at Sasebo, a naval base city in Nagasaki Prefecture. He was assigned duties disarming Japanese forces and disabling heavy weapons on the islands of Tsushima and Hirado. It was during his few months at Sasebo that Seidensticker began to develop a deeper appreciation of Japan and the Japanese people. In early 1946 he was sent to San Diego and discharged.

On his return to the United States, Seidensticker enrolled at Columbia University and took a master&#x27;s degree in 1947 in what was then known as &quot;public law and government.&quot; He joined the U.S. Foreign Service and, after further studies during a summer at Yale University and a year at Harvard, was placed in Tokyo assigned to the Diplomatic Section of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP). In May 1950, roughly two years after he arrived in Japan, Seidensticker decided the Foreign Service was not his calling and he resigned on his own initiative. He had not been promoted while colleagues had, and had deemed himself not the salaryman type. Moreover, he sensed a &quot;witch-hunting&quot; in which bachelors were subjected to &quot;peculiar rumors&quot; and a skeptical eye. He also suspected his room at the Daiichi Hotel, his billet, was bugged.

===Scholar, educator, and latter years===
After his short Foreign Service tenure, Seidensticker studied Japanese literature at the University of Tokyo on the GI Bill and later under a Ford Foundation grant. With the Ford fellowship, Seidensticker switched his focus from studying Heian literature to that of modern Japanese literature. In his remaining years at Tokyo University he read virtually the entire canon of modern Japanese literature. By the mid-1950s, having exhausted the fellowship circuit, he found work as a lecturer of both American and Japanese literature at Sophia University. While Seidensticker enjoyed his time at Sophia, at the time it did not pay well and he took on a free-lance writing assignments and other part-time jobs. In 1954 he was contacted by Harold Strauss, the chief editor at the New York publishing house Alfred A. Knopf about translating Japanese literature for Knopf, and was soon at work.

As the 1960s began to unfold, Seidensticker, growing weary of life in Japan and living life as an outsider, began to consider returning to the United States. In 1962, when an invitation was extended by Stanford University to substitute for a professor on special assignment, he readily accepted and returned to the U.S. after having lived full-time in Japan from 1948 to 1962. Seidensticker taught at Stanford as professor of Japanese from 1962 to 1966. He then joined the faculty at the University of Michigan and remained there for 11 years before being drawn away in 1978 to join the faculty of Columbia University as professor of Japanese. He retired from Columbia in 1985 and was thereafter professor emeritus. During retirement he divided his time between Hawaii and Japan. In 2007, while taking a walk near Shinobazu Pond in the Ueno district of Tokyo, he fell and later died because of head injuries. He was 86.

==Translator==
Seidensticker is widely regarded as one of the greatest translators of classic and modern Japanese literature into English. His translations have been described as &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;elegant.&quot; One contemporary scholar noted that in Seidensticker&#x27;s translations, &quot;You could feel the emotions and nuances that the original writer wanted to convey.&quot; He has even been described as &quot;the best&quot; translator of Japanese literature.

Seidensticker won the National Book Award in category Translation for his edition of Kawabata&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of the Mountain&quot; (a split award).
He also translated &quot;The Decay of the Angel&quot;, the last volume of Yukio Mishima&#x27;s Sea of Fertility tetralogy, and several of Mishima&#x27;s stories. Seidensticker translated Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki&#x27;s &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; and &quot;Some Prefer Nettles&quot; and authored important criticism on Tanizaki&#x27;s place in 20th-century Japanese literature. The &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary allowed the translator to speak for himself:

The last work he supervised translating into English was &quot;You Were Born for a Reason&quot; on Japanese Buddhism.

==Japanologist==
Seidensticker wrote widely on Japan, its people, as well as the city of Tokyo.

His first major non-translation work, &quot;Kafū the Scribbler: The Life and Writings of Nagai Kafū, 1879–1959&quot; (Stanford University Press, 1965), was a biography of Kafū Nagai, the Japanese writer who is noted for his sensitive depictions of the denizens of Tokyo&#x27;s pleasure quarters. It was the first study to examine the life and works of Nagai to appear in any Western language. As the book includes a number of Seidensticker translations of Nagai&#x27;s short stories and novellas, it is neither pure biography nor criticism. Seidensticker, to his lifelong regret, never met Kafū, even though there were opportunities to be introduced.

In &quot;Low City, High City: Tokyo from Edo to the Earthquake&quot; (1983) and &quot;Tokyo Rising: The City Since the Great Earthquake&quot; (1990), Seidensticker&#x27;s two-volume history of Tokyo, he weaves a tale of cultural history of how the city was impacted by the advent of Westernization, and how it responded to the twin disasters of the 20th Century—the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 and the massive destruction incurred in World War II due to Allied bombing raids.

He published his autobiographical observations in &quot;Tokyo Central: A Memoir&quot; in 2001. A biography and bibliography are included in a commemorative work created by those whose lives he affected, &quot;New Leaves: Studies and Translations of Japanese Literature in Honor of Edward Seidensticker&quot; (1993).

After retirement, he divided his time between Honolulu and Tokyo. He described the latter as &quot;the world&#x27;s most consistently interesting city&quot;.

<doc id="1260982" wikidata="Q7307141" url="?curid=1260982" title="Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights">
<text>&quot;Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights,&quot; [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721, was a reference question posed to the Supreme Court of Canada regarding provisions in the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot; stipulating the provision of French language services in the province of Manitoba. The Court heard the appeal in June 1984 and gave its ruling a year later, on June 13, 1985.

Four questions were asked:
# Are sections 133 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, and 23 of the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot;, requiring laws be in both French and English, mandatory in Manitoba, Quebec, and Parliament?
# If so, are those Manitoban laws not printed in both languages invalid under section 23 of the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot;?
# If so, do the laws have any force and effect, and if so to what extent?
# Are any of the provisions of &quot;An Act Respecting the Operation of Section 23 of the Manitoba Act in Regard to Statutes&quot; inconsistent with section 23 of the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot;, and if so are the provisions invalid and of no legal force and effect?

The Court found that the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, and the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot;, did require both languages and that those laws that were not in both languages were of no force and effect. However, they were deemed temporarily valid for a time until translations could be re-enacted in order to avoid a legal vacuum in Manitoba and to ensure the continuity of the rule of law.

This reference was the first time that the courts in Canada had used the remedy of a delayed declaration of invalidity. Despite its exceptional origins, this remedy has grown to become a preferred one in Canadian public law. Manitoba was given a generous period of time to translate the laws and, in 1992, the court was still extending this grace period to be decided by the parties.

<text>Delwin Vriend is a Canadian man who was at the center of a landmark provincial and federal legal case, Vriend v. Alberta, concerning the inclusion of sexual orientation as a protected human right in Canada.

==Early life==
Delwin Vriend was born in Sioux Center, Iowa, in 1966, to a Canadian father and an American mother. At the age of two, Vriend moved to Edmonton, Alberta with his family. The oldest of five children, he was raised with three siblings on an organic vegetable farm south of Edmonton in Leduc County. His parents were members of the local Christian Reformed Church, and he attended private Christian elementary and secondary schools, before enrolling at The King&#x27;s College (now The King&#x27;s University) in Edmonton. He then transferred to Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to earn his physics and mathematics degree.
After briefly being employed as an electrician, Vriend was asked to work at The King&#x27;s College as a laboratory coordinator and chemistry lab instructor. He worked in that capacity for three years.

==Civil rights case==
In 1991, Vriend, who was open within his congregation about being in a same-sex relationship, was fired because his sexual orientation was deemed incompatible with a newly created statement of religious belief adopted by The King&#x27;s College.

Vriend attempted to file a discrimination complaint with the Alberta Human Rights Commission, but was refused on the grounds that sexual orientation was not protected under the province&#x27;s human rights code. He subsequently sued the Government of Alberta and its Human Rights Commission.

In 1994, an Alberta court ruled that sexual orientation must be treated as a protected class under human rights legislation. The provincial government subsequently appealed and in 1996 the decision was overruled by the Alberta Court of Appeal. This decision was then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Vriend v. Alberta, who finally ruled in 1998 that provincial governments could not exclude protection of individuals from human rights legislation on the basis of sexual orientation.

Despite popular misunderstanding, the Vriend case was not against The King&#x27;s College, and Vriend never pursued a human rights complaint against the institution. The case strictly involved whether claims to the Human Rights Commission on the basis of sexual orientation could be investigated by provincial human rights commissions, and did not set any legal precedent for the resolution of such claims. Canadian human rights legislation does exempt religious institutions in specific cases typically involving the education of minors, and the Supreme Court ruling did not change that. However, some religious groups had lobbied the provincial and federal governments to invoke Canada&#x27;s notwithstanding clause to overrule the decision. This course of action was never pursued by the Alberta government.

The Supreme Court decision in Vriend vs. Alberta was used to argue provincial cases against bans on same-sex marriage throughout Canada. In addition, the decision has had greater ramifications within Canadian law outside of sexual orientation issues. It has shaped legal precedent concerning provincial and federal government relationships as well as labor and other civil rights and constitutional laws.

==Personal life==
Delwin Vriend left the Christian Reformed Church. After his termination, Vriend was unemployed for seven months before finding part-time employment with the AIDS Network of Edmonton Society and eventually a full-time position with the University of Alberta library. However, the publicity surrounding the case caused Vriend to leave Canada in 2000.

In 2005, Delwin Vriend placed 44th on the list published by &quot;Alberta Venture&quot; magazine as one of this century&#x27;s 50 greatest Albertans.

In 2011 Delwin Vriend was inducted into the Q Hall of Fame Canada.

<text>This list of Baltimore neighborhoods includes the neighborhoods of Baltimore, Maryland, divided into nine geographical regions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Central. Each district is patrolled by a respective precinct of the Baltimore Police Department. 

Charles Street down to Hanover Street and Ritchie Highway serve as the east-west dividing line and Eastern Avenue to Route 40 as the north-south dividing line. Baltimore Street is the north-south dividing line for the U.S. Postal Service. It is not uncommon for locals to divide the city simply by East or West Baltimore, using Charles Street or I-83 as a dividing line.

The following is a list of major neighborhoods in Baltimore, organized by broad geographical location in the city:

<text>Stephen Samuel Roach (born September 16, 1945) is an American economist. He serves as senior fellow at Yale University’s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, and a senior lecturer at the Yale School of Management. He was formerly chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, and chief economist at Morgan Stanley, the New York City-based investment bank. 
==Early life and education==

==Career==
In 1968, Roach earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and, later, a PhD in economics from New York University.

After earning his PhD, Roach was a research fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. From 1972 until 1979, Roach served as staff economist of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. supervising the preparation of the official Federal Reserve projections of the U.S. economy. From 1979 until joining Morgan Stanley in 1982, Roach was Vice President for Economic Analysis for the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company in New York.

Roach was with Morgan Stanley for 30-plus years. He was the investment bank&#x27;s chief economist since 1982, serving as head of the firm&#x27;s global team of economists in New York, London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Paris. From 2007-10 he was Chairman, Morgan Stanley Asia, from 2010-12 he was Non-Executive Chairman, Morgan Stanley Asia, and since mid-2010 he has been a Senior Fellow at Yale University.

In 2009, Dirk Bezemer, a Professor of Economics at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, noted that Roach was one of the earliest to have predicted the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

==Personal life==
Roach and his wife live in New Canaan, Connecticut.

==Work==
Roach writes monthly columns for the international media organization Project Syndicate.

<doc id="1261001" wikidata="Q1886501" url="?curid=1261001" title="Macroecology">
<text>Macroecology is a subfield in ecology that uses a methodological approach that investigates the empirical patterns and mechanistic processes by which the particulate components of complex ecological systems generate emergent structures and dynamics Unlike traditional ecology, which focuses on local and small-scale interactions, macroecology seeks to identify general emergent patterns within and across spatial and temporal scales.

One of the main tenets of macroecology is that, despite the apparent complexity and randomness of ecological systems, they exhibit a significant degree of order. This order is particularly evident in statistical patterns related to organism interactions, their relationships with the environment, and the emergent structures and dynamics of ecological systems. As put by Brown (1999), &quot;Despite their complexity, ecological systems are not haphazard collections of organisms interacting randomly. Instead, they exhibit a great deal of order: in the kinds of organisms that make up the system, like their interactions with each other and their nonliving environment, and especially in the emergent structure and dynamics of the system. This order is perhaps best revealed in certain statistical patterns.&quot; Lawton aptly captures the essence of macroecology: &quot;Macroecology ... seeks to get above the mind‐boggling details of local community assembly to find a bigger picture, whereby a kind of statistical order emerges from the scrum.” Thus, macroecology often aims to elucidate statistical patterns of abundance, distribution, and diversity across different biological scales.

The term &quot;macroecology&quot; was first introduced by Venezuelan researchers Guillermo Sarmiento and Maximina Monasterio in 1971 and was later adopted by James Brown and Brian Maurer in their 1989 paper in &quot;Science&quot;.

Macroecology is not just a large-scale study; a macroecological approach can also be taken at small scales to study emergent behavior. In essence, macroecology adopts a &quot;top-down&quot; approach, focusing on understanding the properties of entire systems (populations, communities, assemblages etc.) rather than individual components. It is akin to seeing the entire forest instead of individual trees, as Kevin Gaston and Tim Blackburn suggested. Some critical areas of interest within macroecology include the study of species richness, latitudinal gradients in species diversity, the species-area curve, range size, body size, and species abundance. Specifically, the relationship between abundance and range size—exploring why some species are widespread and abundant while others are restricted and less common—has been a focal area of macroecological research.

<text>Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today is a sociological study of contemporary Paganism in the United States written by the American Wiccan and journalist Margot Adler. First published in 1979 by Viking Press, it was later republished in a revised and expanded edition by Beacon Press in 1986, with third and fourth revised editions being brought out by Penguin Books in 1996 and then 2006 respectively.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the book &quot;is credited with both documenting new religious impulses and being a catalyst for the panoply of practices now in existence&quot; and &quot;helped popularize earth-based religions.&quot; Adler was a Neopagan and &quot;recognized witch&quot; herself and a reporter for National Public Radio.

The book is an examination of Neopaganism in the United States from a sociological standpoint, discussing the history and various forms of the movement. It contains excerpts from many interviews with average Pagans, as well as with well-known leaders and organizers in the community.

The first edition of the book sold 30,000 copies.
Successive versions have included over one hundred and fifty pages of additional text and an updated contacts section. It has been praised by Theodore Roszak, Susan Brownmiller, &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; and the &quot;Journal of the American Academy of Religion&quot;.

==Background==

===Paganism and Wicca in the United States===
Contemporary Paganism, which is also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an umbrella term used to identify a wide variety of modern religious movements, particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various pagan beliefs of pre-modern Europe. The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or Wicca, is one of a number of different Pagan religions, and developed in England during the first half of the 20th century. The figure at the forefront of Wicca&#x27;s early development was the English occultist Gerald Gardner (1884-1964), the author of &quot;Witchcraft Today&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Meaning of Witchcraft&quot; (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as Gardnerian Wicca. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a Horned God and a Mother Goddess, the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a Wheel of the Year and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as covens. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, Raymond Buckland (1934-2017), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in Long Island.

In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including Dianic Wicca, a tradition founded in the 1970s which was heavily influenced by second wave feminism, rejecting the veneration of the Horned God and emphasizing female-only covens. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions, who used the pseudonym of Starhawk (1951-), later founded her own tradition, Reclaiming Wicca, as well as publishing &quot;The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess&quot; (1979), through which she helped to spread Wicca throughout the U.S.

===Adler and her research===
In 1976, Adler publicly announced that Viking Press had offered her a book contract to undertake the first wide-ranging study of American Paganism.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot; offers a guide to the Pagan movement across the United States.

==Republication==

===1986 revision===
In 1986, Adler published a revised second edition of &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot;, much expanded with new information. Identifying several new trends that had occurred in American Paganism since 1979, Adler recognized that in the intervening seven years, U.S. Pagans had become increasingly self-aware of Paganism as a movement, something which she attributed to the increasing number of Pagan festivals.
One reviewer noted that the alterations made for the 1986 edition &quot;often creates a vivid contrast with events and persons first described in 1979.&quot;

===1996 revision===
===2006 revision===
The 2006 edition includes a new section on Greencraft (pp. 127–129), a Wiccan tradition emerging out of an Alexandrian Wicca coven , and which features its own rune alphabet and a non-Hebrew form of Kabbalah based on work by Neopagan author R. J. Stewart; it emphasizes the practice of Wicca as a nature religion and as a mystery religion. It also gives a more complete and sympathetic treatment of the Northern European Neopagan revivals grouped under the rubric &quot;Heathenism,&quot; which she admits to having consciously omitted from the first edition because of discomfort with the more conservative social values of this form of Pagan revival, and because some far-right and even neo-Nazi groups were using it as a front for their activities at the time (pp. 286–296). And she prefaces her chapter &quot;Women, Feminism, and the Craft,&quot; which discusses the emergence of feminist forms of Neopaganism, with discussion of how her personal feelings about such groups have changed, but &quot;decided to leave the chapter pretty much as is, with a few minor corrections, and address the question of feminist spirituality today at the end.&quot;

==Reception==

===Academic reviews===
Writing in the &quot;Journal of the American Academy of Religion&quot;, Mara E. Donaldson of the University of Virginia commented that Adler&#x27;s book provided an &quot;extensive study of paganism&quot; that &quot;demythologizes&quot; the movement &quot;without being sentimental or self-righteous.&quot; Considering it to be a &quot;serious corrective to common misconceptions&quot; propagated in the media, Donaldson stated that it was &quot;worth reading&quot; despite what she herself perceived as &quot;neopaganism&#x27;s weaknesses&quot;, namely the movement&#x27;s lack of &quot;historical-traditional-cultural memory&quot; and a lack of &quot;sensitivity to the Western problem of evil&quot;.

In a 1996 paper discussing the various sociological studies that had then been made of Paganism, the sociologist Sarah M. Pike noted that &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot; had gone &quot;a long way towards answering the question&quot; as to &quot;what makes these [Pagan ritual] activities valid and viable to those who engage in them&quot;. In doing so, Pike believed that Adler&#x27;s work was an improvement on earlier sociological studies of the movement, namely that of Nachman Ben-Yehuda, which Pike felt had failed to answer this question. Noting Adler&#x27;s position as a practicing Wiccan, and the impact which this would have on her study, Pike however felt that the book was &quot;less defensive and apologetic than sociological studies conducted by many supposedly objective &quot;outsiders&quot;.&quot; Summarizing &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot; as being &quot;unmatched&quot; in its &quot;sweeping survey&quot; of the Pagan movement, Pike notes that in providing an overview of the subject it failed to focus on &quot;detailed examination of specific issues and events.&quot;

===Other reviews===
Writing for &quot;The Women&#x27;s Review of Books&quot;, Robin Herndobler praised Adler&#x27;s &quot;clear, graceful prose&quot;, and the manner in which she had written about Paganism &quot;with interest and compassion.&quot;

==Influence==

===Pagan community===
Writing in his later biography of Eddie Buczynski, the Pagan independent scholar Michael G. Lloyd noted that Adler&#x27;s book was a marked departure from earlier books dealing with Pagan Witchcraft which continued to equate it with either historical Early Modern witchcraft or Satanism. In her 1999 study of American Wiccans, &quot;A Community of Witches&quot;, the sociologist Helen A. Berger noted that &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot; had been influential in getting many Wiccans to accept the non-existence of a historical Witch-Cult from which their religion descended. Along with Starhawk&#x27;s &quot;Dreaming the Dark&quot; (1982), Adler&#x27;s book politicized practices of Paganism and witchcraft by emphasizing their radical and feminist aspects, and as a result drew many radical feminists into their orbit.

===Academia===
In her sociological study of American Paganism, Loretta Orion, author of &quot;Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited&quot; (1995), noted that she had &quot;benefitted&quot; from Adler&#x27;s study, believing that it contained &quot;insightful reflections&quot; on those whom it was studying.

<doc id="1261011" wikidata="Q1382557" url="?curid=1261011" title="Evolutionary ecology">
<text>Evolutionary ecology lies at the intersection of ecology and evolutionary biology. It approaches the study of ecology in a way that explicitly considers the evolutionary histories of species and the interactions between them. Conversely, it can be seen as an approach to the study of evolution that incorporates an understanding of the interactions between the species under consideration. The main subfields of evolutionary ecology are life history evolution, sociobiology (the evolution of social behavior), the evolution of interspecific interactions (e.g. cooperation, predator–prey interactions, parasitism, mutualism) and the evolution of biodiversity and of ecological communities.

Evolutionary ecology mostly considers two things: how interactions (both among species and between species and their physical environment) shape species through selection and adaptation, and the consequences of the resulting evolutionary change.

==Evolutionary models==

A large part of evolutionary ecology is about utilising models and finding empirical data as proof. Examples include the Lack clutch size model devised by David Lack and his study of Darwin&#x27;s finches on the Galapagos Islands. Lack&#x27;s study of Darwin&#x27;s finches was important in analyzing the role of different ecological factors in speciation. Lack suggested that differences in species were adaptive and produced by natural selection, based on the assertion by G.F. Gause that two species cannot occupy the same niche.

Richard Levins introduced his model of the specialization of species in 1968, which investigated how habitat specialization evolved within heterogeneous environments using the fitness sets an organism or species possesses. This model developed the concept of spatial scales in specific environments, defining fine-grained spatial scales and coarse-grained spatial scales. The implications of this model include a rapid increase in environmental ecologists&#x27; understanding of how spatial scales impact species diversity in a certain environment.

Another model is Law and Diekmann&#x27;s 1996 models on mutualism, which is defined as a relationship between two organisms that benefits both individuals. Law and Diekmann developed a framework called adaptive dynamics, which assumes that changes in plant or animal populations in response to a disturbance or lack thereof occurs at a faster rate than mutations occur. It is aimed to simplify other models addressing the relationships within communities.

== Tangled nature model ==
The tangled nature model provides different methods for demonstrating and predicting trends in evolutionary ecology. The model analyzes an individual prone to mutation within a population as well as other factors such as extinction rate. The model was developed by Simon Laird, Daniel Lawson, and Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen of the Imperial College London in 2002. The purpose of the model is to create a simple and logical ecological model based on observation. The model is designed such that ecological effects can be accounted for when determining form, and fitness of a population.

== Ecological genetics ==

Ecological genetics tie into evolutionary ecology through the study of how traits evolve in natural populations. Ecologists are concerned with how the environment and timeframe leads to genes becoming dominant. Organisms must continually adapt in order to survive in natural habitats. Genes define which organisms survive and which will die out. When organisms develop different genetic variations, even though they stem from the same species, it is known as polymorphism. Organisms that pass on beneficial genes continue to evolve their species to have an advantage inside of their niche.

==Evolutionary ecologists==
=== Charles Darwin ===

The basis of the central principles of evolutionary ecology can be attributed to Charles Darwin (1809–1882), specifically in referencing his theory of natural selection and population dynamics, which discusses how populations of a species change over time. According to Ernst Mayr, professor of zoology at Harvard University, Darwin&#x27;s most distinct contributions to evolutionary biology and ecology are as follows: &quot;The first is the non-constancy of species, or the modern conception of evolution itself. The second is the notion of branching evolution, implying the common descent of all species of living things on earth from a single unique origin.&quot; Additionally, &quot;Darwin further noted that evolution must be gradual, with no major breaks or discontinuities. Finally, he reasoned that the mechanism of evolution was natural selection.&quot;

=== George Evelyn Hutchinson ===
George Evelyn Hutchinson&#x27;s (1903–1991) contributions to the field of ecology spanned over 60 years, in which he had significant influence in systems ecology, radiation ecology, limnology, and entomology. Described as the &quot;father of modern ecology&quot; by Stephen Jay Gould, Hutchinson was one of the first scientists to link the subjects of ecology and mathematics. According to Hutchinson, he constructed &quot;mathematical models of populations, the changing proportions of individuals of various ages, birthrate, the ecological niche, and population interaction in this technical introduction to population ecology.&quot; He also had a vast interest in limnology, due to his belief that lakes could be studied as a microcosm that provides insight into system behavior. Hutchinson is also known for his work Circular Causal Systems in Ecology, in which he states that &quot;groups of organisms may be acted upon by their environment, and they may react upon it. If a set of properties in either system changes in such a way that the action of the first system on the second changes, this may cause changes in properties of the second system which alter the mode of action of the second system on the first.&quot;

=== Robert MacArthur ===

Robert MacArthur (1930–1972) is best known in the field of Evolutionary Ecology for his work &quot;The Theory of Island Biogeography&quot;, in which he and his co-author propose &quot;that the number of species on any island reflects a balance between the rate at which new species colonize it and the rate at which populations of established species become extinct.&quot;

=== Eric Pianka ===

According to the University of Texas, Eric Pianka&#x27;s (1939–2022) work in evolutionary ecology includes foraging strategies, reproductive tactics, competition and niche theory, community structure and organization, species diversity, and understanding rarity. Pianka is also known for his interest in lizards to study ecological occurrences, as he claimed they were &quot;often abundant, making them relatively easy to locate, observe, and capture.&quot;

=== Michael Rosenzweig ===

Michael L. Rosenzweig (1941–present) created and popularized Reconciliation ecology, which began with his theory that designated nature preserves would not be enough land to conserve the biodiversity of Earth, as humans have used so much land that they have negatively impacted biogeochemical cycles and had other ecological impacts that have negatively affected species compositions.

=== Other notable evolutionary ecologists ===
* R. A. Fisher (1890–1962), whose 1930 fundamental theorem of natural selection recognised the power of rigorous application of the theory of natural selection to population biology.
* David Lack (1910–1973), a follower of Charles Darwin, worked to merge the fields of evolutionary biology and ecology, focusing mainly on birds and evolution.
* Thierry Lodé (1956–present), a French ecologist whose work focused on how sexual conflict in populations of species impacts evolution.

==Research==
Michael Rosenzweig&#x27;s idea of reconciliation ecology was developed based on existing research, which was conducted on the principle first suggested by Alexander von Humboldt stating that larger areas of land will have increased species diversity as compared to smaller areas. This research focused on species-area relationships (SPARs) and the different scales on which they exist, ranging from sample-area to interprovincial SPARs. Steady-state dynamics in diversity gave rise to these SPARs, which are now used to measure the reduction of species diversity on Earth. In response to this decline in diversity, Rosenzweig&#x27;s reconciliation ecology was born.

Evolutionary ecology has been studied using symbiotic relationships between organisms to determine the evolutionary forces by which such relationships develop. In symbiotic relationships, the symbiont must confer some advantage to its host in order to persist and continue to be evolutionarily viable. Research has been conducted using aphids and the symbiotic bacteria with which they coevolve. These bacteria are most frequently conserved from generation to generation, displaying high levels of vertical transmission. Results have shown that these symbiotic bacteria ultimately confer some resistance to parasites to their host aphids, which both increases the fitness of the aphids and lead to symbiont-mediated coevolution between the species.

== Color variation in cichlid fish ==
The effects of evolutionary ecology and its consequences can be seen in the case of color variation among African cichlid fish. With over 2,000 species, cichlid fishes are very species-rich and capable of complex social interactions. Polychromatism, the variation of color patterns within a population, occurs within cichlid fishes due to environmental adaptations and to increase chances of sexual reproduction.

<text>MiniGL is an incomplete implementation of the OpenGL specification which implements enough of the API to allow 3D video games in the late 1990s to run with hardware acceleration on contemporary graphics cards, which otherwise provided their own APIs. The original implementation came from 3dfx Interactive, and was designed around supporting &quot;Quake&quot;. Other companies implementing similar software included PowerVR and Rendition.

== History ==

In 1996, id Software announced that the Rendition Vérité was to be the only hardware 3D accelerator targeted by &quot;Quake&quot;. Partly because of the perceived hassle in supporting chipset specific APIs and partly because &quot;Quake&quot;&#x27;s development heritage on high-end workstations made such a thing easy. They also released a Microsoft Windows port of their OpenGL version of &quot;Quake&quot;, named &quot;GLQuake&quot;, even though no consumer chipset had OpenGL support at the time.

In response, 3dfx developed and quickly released the first MiniGL, called &quot;3Dfx GL miniport&quot;: a quick implementation of the bare minimum amount of the OpenGL API that was required to run the OpenGL version of &quot;Quake&quot;. By obtaining a copy of the OpenGL &quot;Quake&quot; executable and a copy of the relevant MiniGL, 3dfx owners could easily modify their copies of &quot;Quake&quot; to play with full 3D acceleration, giving a smoother and better looking display than was possible with the &quot;Quake&quot; software renderer. After the success of the 3dfx original, several other manufacturers followed 3dfx in producing MiniGL drivers.

At the time, the OpenGL API was almost universally agreed to be superior to the then new and immature Direct3D system from Microsoft, so following the arrival of the various MiniGLs, many programmers sought to use them in other programs as an easy way of supporting multiple 3D chipsets. Unfortunately, id Software had not released any official list of OpenGL calls and parameters used by &quot;Quake&quot; and none of the MiniGL implementors had released lists of what their implementation would and would not support.

In practice, this led to a very cautious use of OpenGL features by programmers and new releases of MiniGLs with slightly more functionality every time a major game came along that did not work on the previous generation.

All major 3D card manufacturers now support complete OpenGL implementations, negating the need for any sort of MiniGL.

== Other implementations ==

MiniGL implementations have been developed for other operating systems, including Palm OS and AmigaOS.

<text>The Lubrański Academy (Polish: &quot;Akademia Lubrańskiego&quot;; Latin: &quot;Collegium Lubranscianum&quot;) was a university college that was established in 1518 in Poznań by Bishop Jan Lubrański. It was the first school with university aspirations in Poznań (in fact it was not a full university).

==History==
The academy&#x27;s first rector was the Poznań humanist Tomasz Bederman. Another prominent lecturer was Grzegorz of Szamotuły.

The Lubrański Academy aimed at independence from the Kraków Academy but was finally transformed into a faculty of the Kraków Academy. Before that the Lubrański Academy comprised six schools: of philosophy, logic, mathematics, languages (Latin, Greek), law, and rhetoric.

The academy&#x27;s main building was remodeled in the 17th and 18th centuries.

In 1780 the academy was merged with the Jesuit Collegium Posnaniae.

Today the Lubrański Academy&#x27;s building holds the museum of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Poznań.

<text>A provost is a senior academic administrator. At many institutions of higher education, the provost is the chief academic officer, a role that may be combined with being deputy to the chief executive officer. In some institutions, they may be the chief executive officer of a university, of a branch campus of a university, or of a college within a university.

==Chief academic officer==

The specific duties and areas of responsibility for a provost as chief academic officer vary from one institution to another, but usually include supervision and oversight of curricular, instructional, and research affairs.

A section of Harvard&#x27;s 1997 Re-accreditation Report for the New England Commission of Colleges and Schools described the provost:

The Provost at Harvard acts as an extension of the President. He is the second academic officer, after the President, having purview of the entire University. The Provost has special responsibility for fostering intellectual interactions across the University, including the five Interfaculty Initiatives (environment, ethics and the professions, schooling and children, mind/brain/behavior, and health policy). The Provost also acts to help improve the quality and efficiency of central services organized at Harvard under the aegis of the Vice Presidents.

Imperial College London, the first university in the UK to adopt a dual leadership model with a president and a provost, describes the role of the provost:

The Provost is the chief academic officer. Like the President, the Provost is a distinguished academic who upholds Imperial&#x27;s very high standards for the core academic mission. He has direct responsibility for the major academic units (via the Faculty Deans) and the teaching and research mission via the Vice-Provosts (Education and Research and Innovation). The Provost also has responsibility for human – as well as intellectual – resources, with responsibility for promoting an inclusive and excellent staff and student community.

The various deans of a university&#x27;s schools, colleges, or faculties typically report to the provost, or jointly to them and the institution&#x27;s chief executive officer—which office may be called president, chancellor, vice-chancellor or rector. Likewise do the heads of the various interdisciplinary units and academic support functions (such as libraries, student services, the registrar, admissions, and information technology) usually report there. The provost, in turn, is responsible to the institution&#x27;s chief executive officer and governing board or boards (variously called its trustees, the regents, the governors, or the corporation) for oversight of all educational affairs and activities, including research and academic personnel.

In many but not all North American institutions, the provost or equivalent is the second-ranking officer in the administrative hierarchy. Often the provost may serve as acting chief executive officer during a vacancy in that office or when the incumbent is absent from campus for prolonged periods. In these institutions, the title of provost is sometimes combined with those of &quot;senior vice president&quot;, &quot;executive vice president&quot;, &quot;executive vice chancellor&quot;, or the like, to denote that officer&#x27;s high standing. 

Provosts often receive staff support or delegate line responsibility for certain administrative functions to one or more subordinates variously called &quot;pro-provost&quot;, &quot;assistant provost&quot;, &quot;associate provost&quot;, &quot;vice provost&quot;, or &quot;deputy provost&quot;. The deputy provost is often the right-hand person of the provost who assumes the provost&#x27;s responsibilities in the provost&#x27;s absence.

Provosts are often chosen by a search committee made up of faculty members, and are almost always drawn from the &#x27;tenured faculty&#x27; or &#x27;professional administrators&#x27; with academic credentials, either at the institution or from other institutions.

==Titles and other uses==
At some North American research universities and liberal arts colleges, other titles may be used in place of or in combination with provost, such as chief academic officer or vice president for academic affairs (or, rarely, academic vice-president, academic vice rector, or vice president for education). At smaller independent liberal arts colleges, the chief academic officer may carry the title &quot;dean of the college&quot; or &quot;dean of the faculty&quot; in addition to or instead of &quot;provost&quot;. For example, at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, the dean of the faculty is also the vice president for academic affairs and is the second-highest administrator, directly beneath the president.

In some universities, the chief administrative officer of a large academic division may be a provost. Finally, in some colleges and universities, the title of provost (and the function of deputy to the president or chancellor) may be separate from the function of chief academic officer.

Universities using provost in the title of their chief executive officer include University College London and Trinity College, Dublin. The title is also used for the heads of Oriel, Queen&#x27;s and Worcester colleges in the University of Oxford; King&#x27;s College, Cambridge; St Leonard&#x27;s College, St Andrews; all residential colleges of the University of California, San Diego; and all residential colleges of the University of California, Santa Cruz. The Provost of Eton is the chair of the governors of Eton College.

Many universities also use provost as the title for the chief executive officers of their international branch campuses. Some of these universities also use provost (often in combination as &quot;provost and deputy vice-chancellor&quot; or similar) for their chief academic officer. Glasgow Caledonian New York College shows a mixture of this with the US system: the president of the college is the Glasgow-based Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University, leaving the New York-based Vice President and Provost as the senior official at the campus.

==History==
The title &quot;provost&quot; (Latin: &quot;praepositus&quot;) has been used in England from medieval times for the head of colleges such as Oriel College, Oxford and Eton College. More recent colleges have adopted the same usage, e.g. the principal of University College London was retitled as provost in 1906, and Durham University adopted the title for University College Stockton in 1999 (until it was split into two new colleges in 2001).

Following its usage for the heads of colleges, some multi-campus state university systems in the United States have used &quot;provost&quot; as the title of the head of a branch campus. For example, the chancellors of the Newark and Camden campuses of Rutgers University in New Jersey were formerly known as provosts. A similar practice arose in Britain in the early 21st century with the establishment of international branch campuses, many of which were headed by provosts.

The establishment of provosts as the chief academic officers of universities in the US began in the first half of the 20th century. The first use of the title in American higher education was in 1754 at the University (then the college) of Pennsylvania. The post was created under Benjamin Franklin as president of the board of trustees, and while Franklin was in this position he remained heavily involved in the college. However, on Franklin&#x27;s retirement in 1755 the provost took up the more usual (at the time) role of head of the college, which it retained until the re-establishment of the presidency of the university in 1930. At Columbia University, the board of trustees established the office of provost in 1811 as a political compromise; it was abolished five years later when the holder departed. The Trustees and the president of the university re-established the office of provost in 1912 as the chief academic officer, who &quot;would be associated with the President and the Secretary of the university in the consideration and oversight of matters of general university concern and in the preparation of general university business for consideration either by the Trustees, the University Council, or the appropriate Faculty.&quot; It fell vacant again between 1926 and 1937, but on its restoration was seen as the second officer in the administration, behind only the president.

Other American universities and colleges created provosts as heads of academic affairs during and after World War II, when dramatic increases in undergraduate enrollments (due to the G.I. Bill) and the increased complexity of higher education administration led many chief executive officers to adopt a more corporate governing structure. By the 1960s, many private research universities had provosts installed as their chief academic officers, including Brown (1949), Chicago (1963), Cornell (1931), Dartmouth (1955; in abeyance 1972–79), Duke (1960), Johns Hopkins (1924), MIT (1949), Princeton (1966), Rice (1954), Stanford (1952), Tufts (1951), Wake Forest (1967) and Yale (1919). Harvard was a notable holdout: a provost had been appointed in 1933, but only with authority over the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and the position had been eliminated in 1953. It was not until 1995 that Harvard appointed a university-wide provost.

The use of provost as the title of the chief academic officer of a university (as opposed to its historic use for the head of a college) is relatively recent in the UK. One of the earliest was Imperial College London, where the first provost was appointed in 2012, splitting off the chief academic officer role previously carried out by the rector (chief executive) of the university after a governance review. The vice-chancellor (chief executive) of Durham University praised this arrangement in 2014, following a governance review that recommended it at that university, saying &quot;The Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s role in an international university like this now is something that cannot be done by one person with all the external and internal stuff you have to do. In America it&#x27;s been the case all the time that they&#x27;ve had a president and a provost, with the president being the equivalent of Vice-Chancellor. This more or less splits the external and internal duties. Personally I believe that we should move to this model – Imperial [College] has done it, I believe the LSE [London School of Economics] is moving in that direction and a few others are as well. I think it&#x27;s certainly what we must do to maintain our status as an international university.&quot; Durham expanded the post of deputy vice-chancellor (created 2011) to be the deputy vice-chancellor and provost when it next became vacant in 2016.

 most members of the Russell Group of research-intensive universities in the UK had appointed a senior officer with academic responsibility separate from their chief executive. Some of these used the title &quot;provost&quot; on its own, others used &quot;provost&quot; in combination with another title indicating that they were deputy to the chief executive officer), while both King&#x27;s College London and Southampton eschewed the title &quot;provost&quot; in favour of &quot;Senior Vice-President (Academic)&quot; and Glasgow used &quot;Senior Vice Principal and Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academic)&quot;. The London School of Economics appointed a provost and deputy director in 2013 but, after the holder left in 2015, no longer have the position in their management structure. However, only a few of the Russell Group universities with provosts (including Imperial, Durham, Edinburgh and Bristol) explicitly identified the provost as being the chief academic officer, and Exeter and Sheffield continued to explicitly identify the chief executive officer as the chief academic officer.

<text>Andrew Jay Hinch (born May 15, 1974) is an American professional baseball coach and former catcher who is the manager of the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB). As a member of Team USA, Hinch won a bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics before playing in MLB for the Oakland Athletics (–), Kansas City Royals (–), Detroit Tigers (), and Philadelphia Phillies ().

Born in Iowa, Hinch attended Midwest City High School in Oklahoma, and then Stanford University, where he played college baseball for the Cardinal. In the 1996 MLB draft, the Athletics selected him in the third round, and he appeared in 350 games over seven major league seasons. 

Following his playing career, Hinch managed the Arizona Diamondbacks from May 2009 to July 2010, and became vice president of professional scouting for the San Diego Padres from September 2010 to August 2014. Hinch joined the Houston Astros as manager from 2015 through 2019, guiding the club through one of the most successful periods in franchise history. They won the 2017 World Series, two American League (AL) pennants, and over 100 regular season games each from 2017 to 2019, including a club-record 107 in the latter. Due to being implicated in the Astros&#x27; sign stealing scandal the following year, Hinch was suspended by MLB for one year and fired by the team. Prior to the 2021 season, the Tigers hired Hinch as manager, and he guided the club to their next playoff appearance in 2024.

==Early life==
Hinch lived in Nashua, Iowa, until he was eight, when he moved to Oklahoma. He is a 1992 graduate of Midwest City High School in Midwest City, Oklahoma, where, as a senior, he was the 1992 National Gatorade Player of the Year in baseball. He was drafted in the second round of the Major League Baseball draft but elected to attend Stanford University, where he was a third-round pick after his junior year in 1995. He decided to return to school and was again a third-round pick as a senior in 1996. At Stanford he joined Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. Hinch won a bronze medal for the United States at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and was named to the 1998 Topps All-Star Rookie Team. Hinch is married to his wife, Erin Hinch, with two daughters Haley and Kaitlin.

==Playing career==
Hinch was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the third round of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Athletics in June 1996. He debuted with the Athletics in 1998 and remained with the team through the 2000 season.

In the 2000–01 offseason, Hinch was traded to the Kansas City Royals with Ángel Berroa as part of a 3-team trade that sent Ben Grieve from the Athletics to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Cory Lidle from the Devil Rays to the Athletics, Roberto Hernández from the Devil Rays to the Royals, and Johnny Damon and Mark Ellis to the Athletics from the Royals.

Hinch was released by the Royals after the 2002 season. He signed as a minor league free agent with the Cleveland Indians, but was purchased by the Detroit Tigers from the Indians in March 2003. He signed with the Philadelphia Phillies for the 2004 season, splitting the year between the majors and Triple-A. He spent all of 2005 with the Phillies&#x27; Triple-A affiliate before retiring. In an eight-season major league career, Hinch had a .219 batting average with 32 home runs and 112 runs batted in in 350 games.

==Managing career==

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
After the 2005 season, the Arizona Diamondbacks hired Hinch as their manager of minor league operations. Even while playing, he was planning his post-playing career. He went so far as to go to the 2003 general manager&#x27;s winter meetings to look for future job opportunities and contacts. In July , Baseball America named him one of baseball&#x27;s &quot;10 to watch&quot; in the next 10 years for his promise as a farm director and future general manager. In August 2006, the Diamondbacks named Hinch director of player development.

Hinch was named manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 8, 2009, replacing Bob Melvin, despite never having managed or coached a team at any level. At age 34 years and 357 days, Hinch became the youngest person to be named manager of a Major League team since Eric Wedge (34 years, 275 days).

Hinch, along with general manager Josh Byrnes, was fired from the Diamondbacks on July 1, 2010, following a 31–48 start to the 2010 season. Overall, Hinch compiled an 89–123 record in 212 games; his .420 winning percentage ranks as the lowest for a non-interim manager in Diamondbacks history.

===San Diego Padres===
The San Diego Padres hired Hinch as vice president of professional scouting on September 21, 2010. He reunited with Byrnes, who was the Padres&#x27; senior vice president of baseball operations and in 2011 would become their general manager. Hinch served as interim GM in 2014 along with Omar Minaya and Fred Uhlman, Jr. He resigned from the position on August 5, 2014.

===Houston Astros===
Hinch was named manager of the Houston Astros on September 29, 2014, replacing Bo Porter, who had been fired on September 1, 2014. In the 2015 season, Hinch led the Astros to an 86–76 record and a wild card berth. It was Houston&#x27;s first playoff appearance since their 2005 World Series run. In the Wild Card Game, the Astros defeated the New York Yankees in Yankee Stadium, 3–0, to advance to the American League Division Series (ALDS). Hinch&#x27;s Astros took a 2–1 ALDS lead over the Kansas City Royals. In Game 4, the Astros led the Royals, 6–2, going into the 8th inning; however, the Royals came back to win, 9–6, and the Astros went on to lose Game 5 and the series.

In 2016, Houston began the season 7–17. Although their play improved during the season, the Astros finished 84–78 and did not qualify for the playoffs.

In 2017, the Astros achieved a club-record of 50 wins in 74 games and finished the regular season 101–61, winning their first AL West division title, first division title in 16 years, and first since joining the AL. The 2017 postseason began for the Astros with the ALDS at home. Hinch guided the team past the Boston Red Sox in four games, with his decision to have Justin Verlander pitch in relief in the deciding Game 4 receiving attention. In the American League Championship Series (ALCS), he led the Astros against the Yankees in Houston&#x27;s first League Championship Series (LCS) appearance in 12 years. After his team won the first two games at home, the Yankees rallied with three wins in New York, with Game 4&#x27;s loss resulting from the bullpen giving up six combined runs in the 7th and 8th after Hinch removed pitcher Lance McCullers Jr after only six innings. With a pivotal Game 6 in Houston and Justin Verlander on the mound, the Astros won the game, 7–1. In Game 7, he chose Charlie Morton as his starter. Morton tossed five innings, and Hinch brought in McCullers to pitch the final four in relief as the Astros shutout the Yankees, 4–0. Thus, Houston clinched their first-ever AL pennant, and first overall pennant in 12 years, to advance to the 2017 World Series, 

The Astros faced the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series and won in 7 games. Hinch deployed the same four starting pitchers as he had in the ALCS: Dallas Keuchel, Verlander, McCullers Jr, and Morton, though only McCullers and Morton received wins as two relievers, Chris Devenski and Joe Musgrove, were credited with the other two. In Game 7, Morton pitched the final four innings as the Astros won, 5–1, to clinch their first-ever title. With the win, Hinch earned his 14th playoff victory as manager of the Astros, establishing a club record that eclipsed the 13 attained by Phil Garner.

On August 30, 2018, the Astros signed Hinch to a four-year extension.

On May 30, 2019, Hinch won his 500h game as manager. The Astros won franchise-record 107 games during the regular season, but lost to the Washington Nationals 4 games to 3 in World Series. On January 13, 2020, during the offseason, Hinch and Jeff Luhnow, the team&#x27;s general manager, were suspended one year for violating MLB policies in a sign stealing scandal in 2017. The investigation revealed that Hinch did not approve of the players using a replay monitor to decode signs, and even went as far as to wreck the monitor on at least two occasions. However, he admitted that he did not stop the practice or explicitly let it be known that he disapproved of it. Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred harshly criticized Hinch for not doing more to stop the scheme. According to Manfred, the manager is responsible for &quot;ensuring that the players both understand the rules and adhere to them.” Manfred concluded that there was &quot;no justification for Hinch&#x27;s failure to act,” since Hinch was the players’ immediate supervisor. If Hinch commits further &quot;material violations&quot; of baseball rules, he will be permanently banned from baseball. Hinch fully expected to be suspended, but believed Manfred would only suspend him for a month at most.

The year-long suspension was the second-most severe punishment in baseball history meted out to a manager for in-game misconduct. The only longer suspension was for St. Louis Browns manager Jack O&#x27;Connor, who was banned for life for trying to throw the 1910 American League batting title to Nap Lajoie by bribing the official scorer to change a hit on error to a hit in the final game of the season. Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora was also handed a year-long suspension for his role in the scandal, but was sanctioned for his actions as the Astros&#x27; bench coach.

On the same day, Astros owner Jim Crane fired Hinch and Luhnow, saying, &quot;Neither one of them started this but neither one of them did anything about it.&quot; Crane said that he was going beyond MLB&#x27;s sanctions because he had &quot;higher standards for the city and the franchise.&quot; Largely on the strength of his final three seasons–all but one of the four 100-win seasons in franchise history at the time of his firing–Hinch ended his tenure as the second winningest manager in Astros history, behind only Bill Virdon. As of the end of the 2019 season, his .594 winning percentage was the highest in franchise history.

===Detroit Tigers===
Hinch&#x27;s suspension ended after the 2020 season. He was scheduled to interview for the managerial openings with the Detroit Tigers and Chicago White Sox. When the White Sox unexpectedly hired Tony La Russa, they issued a press release mistakenly bearing Hinch&#x27;s facsimile signature, suggesting Hinch was the team&#x27;s original choice until owner Jerry Reinsdorf intervened. On October 30, 2020, Hinch was named the manager of the Tigers, agreeing on a multi-year contract.

In 2024, Hinch led the Tigers to a wild card berth on an 84–78 third-place finish in the AL Central division. Left-hander Tarik Skubal emerged as the staff ace, winning the AL Triple Crown, the first Tiger do to so since Verlander in 2011. A 55–63 record shortly after the trade deadline did not advertise a playoff destiny after having dealt starter Jack Flaherty, outfielder Mark Canha, reliever Andrew Chafin, and catcher Carson Kelly. Their playoff seeding juxtaposed them with the Houston Astros in the AL Wild Card Series (WCS). As such, Hinch became the third manager in MLB history to face his former team whom he led to a World Series title in a postseason tournament.

<doc id="1261074" wikidata="Q3296810" url="?curid=1261074" title="Palm-of-the-Hand Stories">
<text>is the name Japanese author Yasunari Kawabata gave to 146 short stories he wrote during his long career. The earliest stories were published in the early 1920s, with the last appearing posthumously in 1972. The first Japanese edition to collect these stories appeared in 1971. The title refers to the brevity of the stories – many of which are only two to three pages long – which would &quot;virtually fit into the palm of the hand&quot;.

==Style and themes==
For Susan J. Napier in the &quot;Monumenta Nipponica&quot;, Kawabata&#x27;s brief stories express the facets of his novels, while at the same time &quot;providing an intensity of focus that is the essence of Kawabata&#x27;s celebrated &#x27;haiku-esque&#x27; style&quot;, working with &quot;evocations and suggestions&quot;. Often, the stories focus &quot;on feelings rather than understanding&quot;, presenting &quot;the chaos of the human heart&quot;, and depict &quot;epiphanies, transformations and revelations&quot;. Reviewers also pointed out a &quot;delicate lyricism&quot; and &quot;warmth and fragility&quot; as well as a &quot;cool formalism&quot; and &quot;sharp experimental intention and edge&quot;. Kawabata reportedly claimed to feel most at ease with the short-story form and explained that, while other writers tended to writing poetry in their early years, he wrote his &quot;Palm-of-the-Hand Stories&quot;.

==English translations==
In 1988, North Point Press published the first substantial volume of English translations as &quot;Palm-of-the-Hand Stories&quot; (scattered individual stories had previously appeared in English). It contained a total of 70 stories drawn from the early 1920s until Kawabata&#x27;s death in 1972, translated by Lane Dunlop and J. Martin Holman.

The stories &quot;Japanese Anna&quot; and &quot;The Sea&quot;, which appeared in the 1920s, had not been included in Dunlop&#x27;s and Holman&#x27;s anthology and were translated by Steve Bradbury for the Winter 1994 edition of the journal &quot;Mānoa&quot;.

In 1998, Holman&#x27;s translations of another 18 of the &quot;Palm-of-the-Hand Stories&quot;, that had been published originally in Japanese before 1930, appeared in the anthology &quot;The Dancing Girl of Izu and Other Stories&quot;, published by Counterpoint Press.

==Adaptations==
The story &quot;Thank You&quot; was adapted for the film &quot;Mr. Thank You&quot; by director Hiroshi Shimizu in 1936.

Four stories from &quot;Palm-of-the-Hand Stories&quot; were adapted for an anthology film of the same title that premiered in October 2009 at the Tokyo International Film Festival and was officially released on 27 March 2010. The film contained the stories &quot;The Man Who Did Not Smile&quot;, &quot;Thank You&quot;, &quot;Japanese Anna&quot; and &quot;Immortality&quot;, with each episode directed by a different director (Kishimoto Tsukasa, Miyake Nobuyuki, Tsubokawa Takushi, and Takahashi Yuya).

&quot;Love Suicides&quot; was adapted into a 2009 short film of the same title by Malaysian filmmaker Edmund Yeo. Later in the same year, Yeo adapted &quot;Canaries&quot; into a short film &quot;Kingyo&quot; (replacing canaries with goldfish), which premiered at the Venice Film Festival.

<text>Jakob Walter (September 28, 1788 – August 3, 1864) was a German soldier and chronicler of the Napoleonic Wars. In his later years, he wrote an account of his service in the , including a detailed account of his participation in Napoleon&#x27;s Russian campaign of 1812. This, together with Joseph Abbeel&#x27;s diary, form the only known records of that campaign kept by common soldiers.

==Early life==
Jakob Walter was born in 1788 in the town of Rosenberg, near Ellwangen in the Duchy of Württemberg in the Holy Roman Empire. The area a few years later became part of the short-lived Confederation of the Rhine founded by Napoleon and was at that point a French vassal state.

By trade, Walter was a stonemason. He was a Roman Catholic and seems to have been devout; in his book, he condemns the Brandenburgian peasants for not attending Mass, and at one point tells how he destroyed a book he considered heretical. Walter recorded his sins as well. Walter&#x27;s faith was a common focal point of hope throughout the war.

==First and Second Campaigns==
In 1806, Walter and his brother were conscripted into the regiment of Heinrich Eberhard von Romig and served in the campaign of 1806-1807 in Poland, as part of King Jérôme’s contribution to the . He returned home in 1807 and was recalled for the campaign of 1809 in Austria. After this campaign he returned to civilian life and remained a private citizen through 1810 and 1811.

==The Russian Campaign==
In 1812, Walter was recalled once again for the &quot;Grande Armée&#x27;s&quot; invasion of Russia. Originally Walter&#x27;s regiment was under the command of the Crown Prince of Württemberg, but for the campaign of 1812 it was transferred to the command of Marshal Ney. 

===March to Moscow===
As a common soldier, Walter had a limited view of the scope of the campaigns he was involved in. By far the greater part of his time was spent on the march, and most of his memoir concerns foraging; he speaks of the difficulty of forcing peasants to show where their food was hidden. Finally we arrived at Polotsk, a large city on the other side of the Western Dvina River. In this region I once left the bivouac to seek provisions. There were eight of us, and we came to a very distant village. Here we searched all the houses. There were no peasants left. I later realized how heedless I had been, since each one ran into a house alone, broke open everything that was covered, and searched all the floors and still nothing was found. Finally, when we assembled and were ready to leave, I once more inspected a little hut somewhat removed from the village. Around it from top to bottom were heaped bundles of hemp and shives, which I tore down; and, as I worked my way to the ground, sacks full of flour appeared. Now I joyfully called all my comrades so that we might dispose of the booty. In the village we saw sieves; these we took to sift the flour mixed with chaff an inch long; and, after that, we refilled the sacks. ... Then the question of carrying and dividing the grain arose, but it occurred to me that I had seen a horse in one of the houses. Everyone immediately hurried to find the horse. We found two instead of one, but unfortunately they were both colts, and one could not be used at all. We took the largest, placed two sacks on it, and started out very slowly. While we were marching there, the Russians saw us from a distance with this booty; and at the same moment we saw a troop of peasants in the valley, about fifty. These ran toward us. What could we do but shoot at them?He describes the extremes of heat and cold (made worse because he abandoned his extra clothing in the hot weather, and then suffered in the cold) and notes that more soldiers died from thirst than anything else, because there was very little good water on the route. At times he survived on dough balls made from looted flour mixed with muddy water and roasted in a fire; for almost a week he lived on a jar of honey he dug up from where a peasant had hidden it.

As both a German and a conscript, Walter had no particular loyalty to Napoleon. He rarely mentions him, and when he does he generally refers to him simply as &quot;Bonaparte.&quot; He had no knowledge of the larger strategy of the campaign; his descriptions of combat are chaotic, as in his description of the assault on the city of Smolensk on August 17, 1812:

So, as soon as day broke —we marched against the city. The river was crossed below the city. The suburbs on the northern side were stormed, set on fire, and burned up. My company&#x27;s doctor, named Staüble, had his arm shot away in crossing the stream, and he died afterward. No longer could I pay any attention to my comrades and, therefore, knew not in what way they perished or were lost. Everyone fired and struck at the enemy in wild madness, and no one could tell whether he was in front, in the middle, or behind the center of the army.

Walter was shaken by the efficiency of the Russian scorched earth policy. He recorded that

From Smolensk to Moshaisk the war displayed its horrible work of destruction: all the roads, fields, and woods lay as though sown with people, horses, wagons, burned villages and cities; everything looked like the complete ruin of all that lived.

===Retreat from Moscow===
Walter records that after the fall of Moscow and the subsequent retreat, the French commanders became more brutal to the men; he says that even in retreat the commanders would inspect the men&#x27;s weapons, and men who had rust on their weapons were beaten with clubs &quot;until they were near desperation.&quot; Also, food became even harder to find, and several times he had to fight French and German soldiers over scavenged wheat. In the bivouac at Smolensk, the men slaughtered their horses, and fought over the meat. Unable to get even horse meat, Walter turned to blood:

...I took along the pot I carried, stationed myself beside a horse that was being shot, and caught up the blood...I set this blood on the fire, let it coagulate, and ate the lumps without salt.

On 16 November he arrived in Krasny (with Eugène de Beauharnais) and wrote he knew nothing about Ney who was cut off with his rearguard. On 25 November he arrived at Borisov, on the same day as Napoleon. By the end of December he reached the Polish border. On 24 February he arrived in Ellwangen and met his relatives.

==Later life==
Jakob Walter returned safely to Ludwigsburg and Asperg although he had problems with walking and complained about headaches. He remained there the rest of his life. He married in 1817 and had ten children, of whom five were still living when he wrote a letter to his son Albert in 1856.

In his later years he wrote an account of his experiences, intended for his family. He titled it &quot;Denkwurdige Geschichtschreibung über die erlebte Millitäridienstzeit des Verfassers dieses Schreibens&quot; (&quot;Memorable History of the Military Service Experienced by the Author of these Letters.&quot;) He mailed it to his son Albert, who had emigrated to the United States, in 1856. In 1932, a scholar at the University of Kansas, Frank E. Melvin, acquired the manuscript and authenticated it. Another University of Kansas professor, Otto Springer, translated the work into English, and they published it as &quot;A German Conscript with Napoleon&quot;.

In 1991, Penguin Books re-issued the Springer translation in the United States and Canada under the title &quot;The Diary of a Napoleonic Foot Soldier&quot; (Penguin Books USA, New York, NY, .)

<text>Adventure travel is a type of tourism, involving exploration or travel with a certain degree of risk (real or perceived), and which may require special skills and physical exertion. In the United States, adventure tourism has seen growth in late 20th and early 21st century as tourists seek out-of-the-ordinary or &quot;roads less traveled&quot; vacations, but lack of a clear operational definition has hampered measurement of market size and growth. According to the U.S.-based Adventure Travel Trade Association, adventure travel may be any tourist activity that includes physical activity, a cultural exchange, and connection with outdoor activities and nature.

Adventure tourists may have the motivation to achieve mental states characterized as rush or flow, resulting from stepping outside their comfort zone. This may be from experiencing culture shock or by performing acts requiring significant effort and involve some degree of risk, real or perceived, or physical danger. This may include activities such as mountaineering, trekking, bungee jumping, mountain biking, cycling, canoeing, scuba diving, rafting, kayaking, zip-lining, paragliding, hiking, exploring, Geocaching, canyoneering, sandboarding, caving and rock climbing. Some obscure forms of adventure travel include disaster and ghetto tourism. Other rising forms of adventure travel include social and jungle tourism.

Access to inexpensive consumer technology, with respect to Global Positioning Systems, flashpacking, social networking and photography, have increased the worldwide interest in adventure travel. The interest in independent adventure travel has also increased as more specialist travel websites emerge offering previously niche locations and sports.

Adventure sports tourism has traditionally been dominated by men. Although women&#x27;s participation has grown, the gender gap is still pronounced in terms of quantitative engagement in these forms of sport tourism. Yet, in competitive adventure sport tourism, the success rate of females is currently higher than that of males

Since ancient times, humans have traveled in search for food and skills of survival, but have also engaged in adventurous travel, in explorations of sea lanes, a destination, or even a new country.

Adventurer travelers began to push to the limits, with the mountaineering of Matterhorn in 1865 and the river rafting on the Colorado River in 1869. Shortly after, two key institutions were formed, including the National Geographic Society and 
the Explorers Club, which continue to support adventure travel.

At the end of World War II, modern adventure began to take off, with 1950 French Annapurna expedition and the 1953 British Mount Everest expedition. Today, it remains a niche of travel and a fast-changing sector with new variants of activities for a travel experience.

== Types ==

===Accessible tourism===

There is a trend for developing tourism specifically for the disabled. Adventure travel for the disabled has become a US$13 billion a year industry in North America. Some adventure travel destinations offer diverse programs and job opportunities developed specifically for the disabled.

=== Extreme travel ===

Extreme tourism involves travel to dangerous (&quot;extreme&quot;) locations or participation in dangerous events or activities. This form of tourism can overlap with extreme sport.

=== Jungle tourism ===

Jungle tourism is a subcategory of adventure travel defined by active multifaceted physical means of travel in the jungle regions of the earth. According to the Glossary of Tourism Terms, jungle tours have become a major component of green tourism in tropical destinations and are a relatively recent phenomenon of Western international tourism.

=== Overland travel ===

Overland travel or overlanding refers to an overland journey – perhaps originating with Marco Polo&#x27;s first overland expedition in the 13th century from Venice to the Mongolian court of Kublai Khan. Today overlanding is a form of extended adventure holiday, embarking on a long journey, often in a group. Overland companies provide a converted truck or a bus plus a tour leader, and the group travels together overland for a period of weeks or months.

Since the 1960s overlanding has been a popular means of travel between destinations across Africa, Europe, Asia (particularly India), the Americas and Australia. The &quot;Hippie trail&quot; of the 60s and 70s saw thousands of young westerners travelling through the Middle East to India and Nepal. Many of the older traditional routes are still active, along with newer routes like Iceland to South Africa overland and Central Asian post soviet states.

=== Scuba diving ===

Scuba diving is a sport in which participants explore underwater places while inhaling compressed air from tanks. Scuba diving is most popular in locations with tropical coral reefs, but it may be found in almost any location with water.

Popular destinations:
*Belize&#x27;s Great Blue Hole 
*Tahiti 
*Sipadan Island&#x27;s Barracuda Point

<doc id="1261099" wikidata="Q4719461" url="?curid=1261099" title="Alexander McAulay">
<text>Alexander McAulay (9 December 1863 – 6 July 1931) was the first professor of mathematics and physics at the University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania. He was also a proponent of dual quaternions, which he termed &quot;octonions&quot; or &quot;Clifford biquaternions&quot;.

McAulay was born on 9 December 1863 and attended Kingswood School in Bath. He proceeded to Caius College, Cambridge, there taking up a study of the quaternion algebra. In 1883 he published an article &quot;Some general theorems in quaternion integration&quot;. McAulay took his degree in 1886, and began to reflect on the instruction of students in quaternion theory. In an article &quot;Establishment of the fundamental properties of quaternions&quot; he suggested improvements to the texts then in use. He also wrote a technical article on integration.

Departing for Australia, he lectured at Ormond College, University of Melbourne from 1893 to 1895. As a distant correspondent, he participated in a vigorous debate about the place of quaternions in physics education. In 1893 his book &quot;Utility of Quaternions in Physics&quot; was published. A. S. Hathaway contributed a positive review and Peter Guthrie Tait praised 
it in these terms:
:Here, at last, we exclaim, is a man who has caught the full spirit of the quaternion system: the real &quot;aestus&quot;, the &quot;awen&quot; of the Welsh Bards, the &quot;divinus afflatus&quot; that transports the poet beyond the limits of sublunary things! Intuitively recognizing its power, he snatches up the magnificent weapon which Hamilton tenders us all, and at once dashes off to the jungle on the quest of big game.

McAulay took up the position of Professor of Physics in Tasmania from 1896 until 1929, at which time his son Alexander Leicester McAulay took over the position for the next thirty years.

Following William Kingdon Clifford who had extended quaternions to dual quaternions, McAulay made a special study of this hypercomplex number system. In 1898 McAulay published, through Cambridge University Press, his &quot;Octonions: a Development of Clifford&#x27;s Biquaternions&quot;.

McAulay died on 6 July 1931. 
His brother Francis Macaulay, who stayed in England, also contributed to ring theory. The University of Tasmania has commemorated the McAulays&#x27; contributions in &quot;Winter Public Lectures&quot;.

<doc id="1261101" wikidata="Q7087929" url="?curid=1261101" title="Oliver Wendell Jones">
<text>Oliver Wendell Jones is a fictional character in &quot;Bloom County&quot;, &quot;Outland&quot; and &quot;Opus&quot;, three comic strips by American cartoonist Berkeley Breathed. The character was named for 
United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

==Fictional character biography==
Oliver is an elementary-school age child with an incredibly advanced knowledge of science, math, technology, and computers. He is a strict rationalist and an atheist, although his understanding of the complex nature of the universe drives him to consider (once per year, on a strict schedule) the possibility of an intelligence behind its creation. His father, Frank Jones, was a regular character in the series, while his mother, while present, appeared far less and usually only in direct reaction to Oliver&#x27;s storylines. The Jones family represented the only African-American family in the strip, a fact that was often referenced directly as a point of humor or satire.

The genius of the group, he frequently use his intelligence for political activism that borders on the illegal, such as hacking and dangerous scientific experiments. His father Frank frequently punishes him for his criminal activities, albeit begrudgingly, particularly when some of Oliver&#x27;s schemes profit Frank personally.

===First appearance===
Oliver first appeared in a &quot;Bloom County&quot; daily strip on September 26, 1983, dragging a desktop computer in a wagon. Over the course of strips on the following four days, he used his Banana Jr. 6000 computer to alter the front page of the &quot;New York Times&quot; from &quot;Reagan Calls Women &#x27;America&#x27;s Most Valuable Resource&#x27;&quot; to &quot;Reagan Calls Women &#x27;America&#x27;s Li&#x27;l Dumplin&#x27;s&#x27;&quot;, sparking nationwide outrage (the comment was based on a real comment made by Hayden Fry, the football coach for the University of Iowa). He similarly hacked into the headquarters of Russia&#x27;s state-owned newspaper and attempted to change the headlines to “Gorbachev Urges Disarmament! Complete! Total!” (though due to a mistranslation, the headlines actually read &quot;Gorbachev Sings Tractors! Turnips! Buttocks!&quot;). He also breached computers at the National Strategic Defense Center (a reference to NORAD), AT&amp;T&#x27;s telephone customer account file, and the IRS in order to give his father a multi-million dollar tax refund.

Among his other accomplishments is building an atomic bomb for a school science project using radioactive material scraped from luminescent clocks, a feat that got him suspended from school. He also hijacked HBO&#x27;s transmissions, claiming to be leader of the &quot;People&#x27;s Revolutionary Anti Scrambling Front for the Liberation of Public Airwaves etc, etc.&quot; in a stunt reminiscent of Captain Midnight&#x27;s similar hijacking of HBO.

===Parents===
Oliver&#x27;s parents are Frank and Eleanor Jones, named for Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt. Frank is resigned to having a &quot;weird&quot; son and often deliberately ignores Oliver&#x27;s activities because he realizes he would not understand the explanation even if Oliver gave one (Frank has also stated that if he ever &quot;did&quot; understand the explanation, he would have report his son to the authorities). At times Oliver uses his father as an unwitting guinea pig for his experiments or outright bribes him to look the other way; Frank usually recovers from these misadventures to punish Oliver with a spanking or by temporarily taking away his computer.

On the other hand, Eleanor is deeply distressed by her son&#x27;s behavior, though mostly from the point of view that he should seek out friends or typical hobbies (such as football) rather than lock himself away with his computer and experiments. She also encourages him to look for more mainstream role models, at one point attempting to dress him as Michael Jackson. Oliver takes pains to conceal his exploits from his mother for fear of upsetting her. Frank likewise tries to keep the truth from his wife, though this is often because he himself is complicit in encouraging Oliver&#x27;s illegal schemes.

==Inventions==

===The Electro-Photo Pigment-izer===
In an attempt to destroy the South African apartheid regime, Oliver invented a camera whose flash turned the victim&#x27;s skin color darker, with the intention of using it on the white South African ambassador in order to cause political chaos. The plan was thwarted when Cutter John, who had volunteered to be airdropped into the South African embassy with the use of helium balloons attached to his wheelchair, was blown off course and ended up being captured by a Russian submarine.

===The Teleportation Device===
This was an attempt to transport matter. A few bugs plagued it in the beginning: Oliver&#x27;s first attempt at teleportation landed him part way in the floor. Another attempt resulted in his father&#x27;s Jaguar XJS being transported into orbit around Pluto. The largest disaster was due to Bill The Cat&#x27;s presence in the transporter with Oliver, which changed Oliver into half-human half-cat, a la &quot;The Fly&quot;. This was later revealed to be a dream.

===Scalp Tonic===
In the course of attempting to create a deodorant from Bill the Cat&#x27;s sweat, the resulting solution was discovered to cure baldness, launching a hair-tonic business for the Jones family until the government declared the tonic a controlled substance. Subsequently, the price of the tonic skyrocketed, and the Bloom County gang soon found themselves running a lucrative underground hair-tonic cartel, only to have it collapse when the government later decriminalized the tonic.

===The Grand Unification Theory===
Oliver began an escalating rivalry with Stephen Hawking after learning that they were both seeking an equation that explained the universe.
Oliver wrote a letter to Hawking, ridiculing his mathematical abilities; Hawking responded by mailing Oliver a thermonuclear bomb. Oliver eventually beat Hawking to the equation and attempted to explain it to Opus.

The company was founded in 1993 by a coalition of African-American artists and writers, consisting of Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, Michael Davis, Derek T. Dingle and Christopher Priest. The founders felt that minorities were severely underrepresented in American comics and wished to address this.

==History==
===Development===
Christopher Priest participated in the early planning stages of Milestone Media, and was originally slated to become the editor-in-chief of the new company, but left the endeavor for personal reasons before any of Milestone&#x27;s titles were published. Davis left Milestone in 1995, after the imprint had launched, to become president of the new company Motown Animation &amp; Filmworks. Cowan soon joined him to serve as editor-in-chief.

All Milestone Media titles were set in a continuity dubbed the &quot;Dakotaverse&quot;, referring to the fictional midwestern city of Dakota in which most of the early Milestone stories were set. Before any titles were published, an extensive &quot;bible&quot; was created by McDuffie and other early creators which provided back-story and information on all of the original Dakotaverse characters, as well as detailed information about the history and geography of Dakota. Cowan produced the original character sketches that served as a guide for the other artists.

===Publishing deal===
Although Milestone comics were published through DC Comics, they did not fall under DC Comics&#x27; editorial control; DC retained only the right not to publish any material they objected to. Milestone Media retained the copyright of their properties and had the final say on all merchandising and licensing deals pertaining to them. In essence, DC licensed the characters, editorial services, and creative content of the Milestone books for an annual fee and a share of the profits. Dwayne McDuffie said that DC held up this agreement even though some of Milestone&#x27;s storylines made them &quot;very uncomfortable&quot; as they were from perspectives that DC weren&#x27;t used to. The biggest conflict they had was when an issue of Static showed the hero kissing his girlfriend on a bed, with unopened condoms visible. DC didn&#x27;t want to publish this cover on grounds that it was using sex to sell comics; Milestone covered most of the image as a compromise. McDuffie believed it made DC uncomfortable because it was specifically &quot;black sexuality&quot;, noting that the man who communicated DC&#x27;s concerns at the time was standing in front of a copy of &quot;Legionnaires&quot; #16, the cover of which depicts a blonde, white character in a revealing costume posing in a sexually suggestive position.

===Dakotaverse===
In 1993, Milestone Media launched its first four titles: &quot;Hardware&quot;, &quot;Icon&quot;, &quot;Blood Syndicate&quot; and &quot;Static&quot;. At the same time, SkyBox and DC issued a trading card series, &quot;Milestone: The Dakota Universe&quot; (1993).

A year later, Milestone Media published its first company-wide crossover, &quot;Shadow War&quot;, which spawned two more titles: &quot;Shadow Cabinet&quot; and &quot;Xombi&quot;. Another ongoing series, &quot;Kobalt&quot;, was introduced later. Milestone also participated in an intercompany crossover with DC, called &quot;Worlds Collide&quot; in which Metropolis-based superheroes from the DC Universe and Dakota-based superheroes from the Dakotaverse interacted temporarily.

Milestone had several advantages in its publishing efforts: their books were distributed and marketed by one of the &quot;Big Two&quot; comic book publishers; the comics industry had experienced remarkable increases in sales in preceding years; they featured the work of several well-known and critically acclaimed creators; they used a coloring process that gave their books a distinctive look, and they had the potential to appeal to an audience that was not being targeted by other publishers.

They also suffered from several disadvantages: the comics market was experiencing a glut of &quot;new universes&quot; as several other publishers launched superhero lines around the same time (a slump would start in 1993 and a market crash in 1994), and a significant number of retailers and readers perceived the Milestone books to be &quot;comics for blacks&quot; and assumed they would not interest non-African-American readers. The books received limited exposure beyond existing comics-shop customers, the coloring process added slightly to the cover price of their books, and overall comics sales had peaked around the time of Milestone&#x27;s launch and declined dramatically in the years that followed. Initial sales, however, were found to be decent – albeit not as high as other companies. The perception of &quot;comics for blacks&quot; would be used by industry insiders to justify these early sales issues, ignoring the existence of the glut; few people at the time wanted to believe that the market conditions might be unsound and excuses were needed for why newer companies were struggling.

Milestone cancelled several of its lower-selling series in 1995 and 1996, and aborted plans for several mini-series. &quot;Heroes&quot;, a new team book featuring Static and several of its more popular second-tier characters, was launched, but failed to sell well enough to justify an ongoing series. Milestone shut down its comic book division in 1997, with some of the remaining ongoing series discontinued in mid-story. It became primarily a licensing company, focusing on the Emmy Award and Humanitas Prize-winning animated series &quot;Static Shock&quot;.

In 2010, DC released a limited series titled &quot;Milestone Forever&quot;. Taking place in the original Milestone Universe, it detailed the final fate of several of Dakota&#x27;s heroes and revealed the events that led to its earlier merger into the DC Universe.

===DC Universe===

In 2008, DC Comics executive editor Dan DiDio announced that the Milestone Universe and characters would be revived and merged into the DC Universe proper. Examples of the integration included Static joining the Teen Titans; Static, Icon, Rocket and Hardware appearing in the &quot;Young Justice&quot; TV series; various character appearances in &quot;Brave and the Bold&quot;; and the Shadow Cabinet appearing in &quot;Justice League of America&quot;. An ongoing series starring Static was included in the initial 2011 launch of The New 52, but was cancelled after eight issues.

=== &quot;Milestone Returns&quot; ===

In a January 2015 interview, writer Reginald Hudlin discussed a relaunch of Milestone Media Group, along with surviving co-founders Denys Cowan and Derek Dingle. The following July, DC Comics announced the creation of &quot;Earth-M&quot; within their multiverse, which would be home to the earlier Milestone characters as well as new ones, and that one or two Earth M imprint titles would be published annually, as well as miniseries and one-shots. No further developments took place until October 2017, when it was announced that Milestone would be returning in 2018 with five titles, including &quot;Milestone&quot; (featuring Icon and Rocket), a new Static series, &quot;Duo&quot; (based on the character Xombi), and two other new titles: &quot;Earth-M&quot; and &quot;Love Army&quot;. Charlotte Fullerton, Dwayne McDuffie&#x27;s widow who inherited his 50% share in the original Milestone Media company, sued in August 2017 over being excluded from the revived company despite the new Milestone taking over the original&#x27;s Milestone IPs.

The line was finally revived in &quot;Milestone Returns&quot; #0 in September 2020.

==Staff==
Milestone&#x27;s founders were joined in the company&#x27;s formative years by young professionals who formed the early production team for the startup company. The first two non-founder employees of Milestone were Matt Wayne, a script and comic writer who became editor, then managing editor; and Christine Gilliam, head of corporate communications. By January 1993, Noelle Giddings, who had previously worked in comics as a colorist, became Milestone&#x27;s color editor, supervising the line&#x27;s painted art; and Joe James, an experienced graphic designer, served as designer and creative associate. Later the production staff would expand to include Erica Helene, Jason Medley, Jacqueline Ching, Joe Daniello, Andrew Burrell, Marcus Bennett, and Michelline Hess. Allen Epps was the CFO and Bob Stein was the legal counsel.

In addition to using the talents of established creative professionals such as Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, M.D. Bright, Madeleine Blaustein, and Mike Gustovich, Milestone hired new talent, many of whom went on to successful careers. Among them are John Paul Leon, Christopher Sotomayor, Christopher Williams (aka ChrisCross), Ivan Velez Jr., Shawn Martinbrough, Tommy Lee Edwards, Jason Scott Jones (aka J.Scott.J), Prentis Rollins, J.H. Williams III, Humberto Ramos, John Rozum, Eric Battle, Joseph Illidge, Jamal Igle, Chris Batista, Harvey Richards, and Robert L. Washington III.

<doc id="1261112" wikidata="Q2299490" url="?curid=1261112" title="Somaclonal variation">
<text>Somaclonal variation is the variation seen in plants that have been produced by plant tissue culture. Chromosomal rearrangements are an important source of this variation. The term somaclonal variation is a phenomenon of broad taxonomic occurrence, reported for species of different ploidy levels, and for outcrossing and inbreeding, vegetatively and seed propagated, and cultivated and non-cultivated plants. Characters affected include both qualitative and quantitative traits.

Somaclonal variation is not restricted to, but is particularly common in, plants regenerated from callus. The variations can be genotypic or phenotypic, which in the latter case can be either genetic or epigenetic in origin. Typical genetic alterations are: changes in chromosome numbers (polyploidy and aneuploidy), chromosome structure (translocations, deletions, insertions and duplications) and DNA sequence (base mutations). A typical epigenetics-related event would be gene methylation.
If no visual, morphogenic changes are apparent, other plant screening procedures must be applied. There are both benefits and disadvantages to somaclonal variation. The phenomenon of high variability in individuals from plant cell cultures or adventitious shoots has been named somaclonal variation.

==Advantages==
The major likely benefit of somaclonal variation is plant/crop improvement. Somaclonal variation leads to the creation of additional genetic variability. Characteristics for which somaclonal mutants can be enriched during &quot;in vitro&quot; culture includes resistance to disease pathotoxins, herbicides, high salt concentration, mineral toxicity and tolerance to environmental or chemical stress, as well as for increased production of secondary metabolites.

Suitable for breeding of new species.

==Disadvantages==
A serious disadvantage of somaclonal variation occurs in operations which require clonal uniformity, as in the horticulture and forestry industries where tissue culture is employed for rapid propagation of elite genotypes.
* Sometimes leads to undesirable results
* Selected variants are random and genetically unstable
* Require extensive and extended field trials
* Not suitable for complex agronomic traits like yield, quality etc.

==Reducing somaclonal variation==
Different steps can be used to reduce somaclonal variation. It is well known that increasing numbers of subculture increases the likelihood of somaclonal variation, so the number of subcultures in micropropagation protocols should be kept to a minimum. Regular reinitiation of clones from new explants might reduce variability over time. Another way of reducing somaclonal variation is to avoid 2,4-D in the culture medium, as this hormone is known to introduce variation.

<text>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that an ordinance passed in Hialeah, Florida, forbidding the unnecessary killing of &quot;an animal in a public or private ritual or ceremony not for the primary purpose of food consumption&quot;, was unconstitutional.

==Background==
Santería is an Afro-Cuban religion developed as a syncretism of Roman Catholicism and Yoruba religion by Yoruba people brought as slaves from Yorubaland to Cuba by the Atlantic slave trade. Adherents can fulfill their destiny through the aid of beings known as orishas, who subsist off blood from animal sacrifice. Animals, usually chickens, killed during ritual slaughter are then cooked and eaten by the celebrants, except during death and healing rituals, where sick energy is believed to have passed into the sacrifice. Santeria has been subject to widespread persecution in Cuba, so it is traditionally practiced in secret, employing saint symbolism.

The Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc., is a Florida nonprofit organized in 1973 by Ernesto Pichardo, who was an Italero-level priest in the Santeria faith. The Lucumí language is used in the Santeria liturgy and Babalú-Ayé is the spirit of wrath and disease. In April 1987, the Church leased a property at 173 W. 5th Street, Hialeah, in Miami-Dade County, Florida and announced its intention to use the site to openly practice the faith.

The Hialeah City Council held an emergency public session on June 9, 1987. At the session, Councilman Silvio Cardoso stated that the religion is &quot;in violation of everything this country stands for&quot;; Councilman Andres Mejides observed that the Bible does not allow this particular type of animal sacrifice; and Councilman Julio Martinez noted (to audience applause) that in Cuba &quot;people were put in jail for practicing this religion.&quot; Hialeah&#x27;s police chaplain testified that the Church worshipped &quot;demons&quot; and the city attorney testified that &quot;this community will not tolerate religious practices abhorrent to its citizens.&quot; Pichardo&#x27;s brief testimony was met with taunts from the audience.

At the end of the session the city council passed a resolution announcing its commitment to prohibit &quot;all religious groups which are inconsistent with public morals, peace or safety”. The city further passed a resolution incorporating Florida&#x27;s animal cruelty statute into the city code and the city attorney obtained a Florida Attorney General&#x27;s Opinion from Bob Butterworth concluding that the state statute did not permit ritual animal sacrifice.

In September 1987, the city council unanimously passed three new ordinances that criminalized “sacrifices of animals for any type of ritual, regardless of whether or not the flesh or blood of the animal is to be consumed.” The city council exempted kosher slaughterhouses, regular slaughterhouses, hunting, fishing, pest extermination, euthanasia of stray animals, and feeding live rabbits to greyhounds.

The Church sued in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On June 10, 1988, U.S. District Judge Eugene P. Spellman granted absolute immunity to the individual city council members and the mayor. On October 5, 1989, after a nine-day bench trial, Judge Spellman granted summary judgment to the city. In 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in an unsigned one-paragraph per curiam decision, where it noted that Judge Spellman &quot;employed an arguably stricter standard&quot; than that applied in &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot; (1990), which had in the interim found Native Americans could be fired for their ritual use of peyote. In &quot;Smith&quot;, Justice Antonin Scalia had even cited Judge Spellman&#x27;s opinion as authority, which the city highlighted in their appeals brief.

The Court in &quot;Wisconsin v. Yoder&quot; (1972) had explicitly provided Amish parents a religious exemption from mandatory school attendance under the Free Exercise Clause. However, in the years since, free-exercise claimants had lost every case before the Court, with the exception of a line of employment decisions cases terminated by &quot;Smith&quot;. The Church&#x27;s petition for certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States was granted, with Douglas Laycock appearing for the Church during oral arguments on November 4, 1992.

==Supreme Court==
===Opinion of the Court===
On June 11, 1993, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the appeals court&#x27;s decision. Justice Anthony Kennedy, in an Opinion of the Court joined in parts by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Justices Byron White, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, David Souter, and Clarence Thomas concluded that the city&#x27;s ordinances violated the Free Exercise Clause of the United States Constitution.

Kennedy read the &quot;Smith&quot; decision as requiring a compelling governmental interest if a law is not of neutral and general applicability. Kennedy went on, in a section Souter and White refused to join, to conclude that although the ordinances were facially neutral, they were religiously &quot;gerrymandered with care&quot; to only apply to religious killings. Kennedy, in a section only joined by Stevens, detailed the ordinances&#x27; legislative history, even citing taped excerpts of the Hialeah City Council Meeting. Next, in a section Souter refused to join, Kennedy noted the numerous exemptions in the Florida statute, concluding the law is not generally applicable because it effectively applies &quot;only against conduct motivated by religious belief.&quot; Finally, in a section joined by the full seven justice majority, Kennedy applied strict scrutiny, which the city ordinances fail.

Because the ordinance suppressed more religious conduct than was necessary to achieve its stated ends, it was deemed unconstitutional, with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision, &quot;religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection&quot;. In sum the Court concluded:

We conclude, in sum, that each of Hialeah&#x27;s ordinances pursues the city&#x27;s governmental interests only against conduct motivated by religious belief. The ordinances &quot;ha[ve] every appearance of a prohibition that society is prepared to impose upon [Santeria worshippers] but not upon itself.&quot; &quot;Florida Star v. B. J. F.&quot;, 491 U. S. 524, 542 (1989) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). This precise evil is what the requirement of general applicability is designed to prevent.

III

A law burdening religious practice that is not neutral or not of general application must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny. To satisfy the commands of the First Amendment, a law restrictive of religious practice must advance&quot; &#x27;interests of the highest order&#x27;&quot; and must be narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests. &quot;McDaniel v. Paty&quot;, 435 U. S., at 628, quoting &quot;Wisconsin v. Yoder&quot;, 406 U. S. 205, 215 (1972). The compelling interest standard that we apply once a law fails to meet the Smith requirements is not &quot;water[ed] ... down&quot; but &quot;really means what it says.&quot; &quot;Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith&quot;, 494 U. S., at 888. A law that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment or advances legitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a religious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare cases. It follows from what we have already said that these ordinances cannot withstand this scrutiny.

First, even were the governmental interests compelling, the ordinances are not drawn in narrow terms to accomplish those interests. As we have discussed, see supra, at 538540, 543-546, all four ordinances are overbroad or underinclusive in substantial respects. The proffered objectives are not pursued with respect to analogous nonreligious conduct, and those interests could be achieved by narrower ordinances that burdened religion to a far lesser degree. The absence of narrow tailoring suffices to establish the invalidity of the ordinances. See &quot;Arkansas Writers&#x27; Project, Inc.&quot;

Respondent has not demonstrated, moreover, that, in the context of these ordinances, its governmental interests are compelling. Where government restricts only conduct protected by the First Amendment and fails to enact feasible measures to restrict other conduct producing substantial harm or alleged harm of the same sort, the interest given in justification of the restriction is not compelling. It is established in our strict scrutiny jurisprudence that &quot;a law cannot be regarded as protecting an interest &#x27;of the highest order&#x27; ... when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited.&quot; &quot;Florida Star v. B. J. F.&quot;, supra, at 541-542 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (citation omitted). See &quot;Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd.&quot;, 502 U. S. 105, 119-120 (1991). Cf. &quot;Florida Star v. B. J. F.&quot;, supra, at 540541; &quot;Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing Co.&quot;, 443 U. S. 97, 104105 (1979); id., at 110 (REHNQUIST, J., concurring in judgment). As we show above, see supra, at 543-546, the ordinances are underinclusive to a substantial extent with respect to each of the interests that respondent has asserted, and it is only conduct motivated by religious conviction that bears the weight of the governmental restrictions. There can be no serious claim that those interests justify the ordinances.

IV

The Free Exercise Clause commits government itself to religious tolerance, and upon even slight suspicion that proposals for state intervention stem from animosity to religion or distrust of its practices, all officials must pause to remember their own high duty to the Constitution and to the rights it secures. Those in office must be resolute in resisting importunate demands and must ensure that the sole reasons for imposing the burdens of law and regulation are secular. Legislators may not devise mechanisms, overt or disguised, designed to persecute or oppress a religion or its practices. The laws here in question were enacted contrary to these constitutional principles, and they are void.&quot;

===Scalia&#x27;s concurrence in part===
Justice Scalia joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, defended the &quot;Smith&quot; decision and attacked the use of legislative intent, opining that there would be no constitutional violation if “the Hialeah City Council set out resolutely to suppress the practices of Santeria, but ineptly adopted ordinances that failed to do so”.

===Souter&#x27;s concurrence in part===
Justice Souter, writing alone for eighteen pages, noted that &quot;The &quot;Smith&quot; rule, in my view, may be reexamined consistently with principles of &quot;stare decisis&quot;.&quot;

===Blackmun&#x27;s concurrence in the judgment===
Justice Harry Blackmun, joined by Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, concurred in the judgment only. Refusing to endorse the approach used in the majority opinion, Blackmun wrote, &quot;I continue to believe that &quot;Smith&quot; was wrongly decided&quot;. Blackmun goes on, citing an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, to observe that had this case presented &quot;a law that sincerely pursued the goal of protecting animals from cruel treatment&quot;, the result may have been different.

==Subsequent developments==
Somewhat similarly in 2009, a freedom of religion case related to animal sacrifice was taken to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the case of &quot;Merced v. Kasson.&quot; Merced was a Santeria priest and the president of Templo Yoruba Omo Orisha Texas, Inc., a Santeria religious group. He challenged Euless, Texas city ordinances prohibiting the slaughter of four-legged animals. The court ruled that the ordinances &quot;substantially burden plaintiff&#x27;s free exercise of religion without advancing a compelling governmental interest using the least restrictive means&quot; and that Merced was entitled under the Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act (TRFRA) to an injunction preventing the city from enforcing its ordinances that burdened his religious practices relating to the use of animals. The court did not reach Merced&#x27;s claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

<doc id="1261120" wikidata="Q1048896" url="?curid=1261120" title="Wrentit">
<text>The wrentit (Chamaea fasciata) is a small bird that lives in chaparral, oak woodlands, and bushland on the western coast of North America. It is the only species in the genus Chamaea.

Its systematics have been the subject of much debate, the wrentit having been placed in many different families by different authors for as long as it has been known to science. Its common name reflects the uncertainty, and its external resemblance to both tits and wrens. It is not related to either, however. More recent and comprehensive phylogenetic studies support it belonging to the parrotbills.

==Description==

The wrentit is a small, bird with uniform dull olive, brown, or grayish plumage. It has short wings and a long tail often held high (hence the comparison to wrens). It has a short bill and a pale iris. Given its retiring nature and loud voice, the wrentit is more likely to be detected by its call than by sight. The distinct sound that it makes is similar to the sound of a ping-pong ball falling on the table.

==Systematics==
The wrentit has been variously placed in its own family, the Chamaeidae, or with the long-tailed tits (Aegithalidae), the true tits and chickadees (Paridae), the &quot;Old World warblers&quot; (Sylviidae), and with the &quot;Old World babblers&quot; (Timaliidae). The American Ornithologists&#x27; Union places the wrentit in the latter family, giving it the distinction of being the only babbler known from the New World. This is based on DNA–DNA hybridization studies, which are phenetic, however, and therefore not considered methodologically adequate today.

Through DNA sequence analysis, it was subsequently discovered that the wrentit was more closely allied to &quot;Sylvia&quot; warblers and some aberrant &quot;babblers&quot;. These consequently must be placed in the family Sylviidae together with the wrentit and the parrotbills which also turned out to be close relatives. Thus, the wrentit is the only American species of the &quot;true&quot; or sylviid warblers. Peculiarly, the Dartford warbler and close relatives like Marmora&#x27;s warbler bear an uncanny resemblance to the wrentit; their ecology is quite similar indeed, as all are birds of Mediterranean scrub. However, biogeography and the molecular data build a strong case for this similarity being a case of convergent evolution between birds that are close relatives but by far not as close as their appearance would suggest.

Alice Cibois suggested that as some babblers are closer to typical warblers than these are to marsh-warblers for example, the Sylviidae should be merged into the Timaliidae. As such an abolishing of the senior synonym would require a formal International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruling and the typical warblers and relatives are still a monophyletic group at present, this proposal is not advanced by most researchers until the remaining Sylviidae and Timaliidae genera are studied as regards their relationships.

In 2019, a major taxonomic revision of species formerly classified as &quot;babblers&quot; recovered &quot;Chamaea&quot; as being most closely allied with the parrotbills and fulvettas, which are otherwise an exclusively Asian group. Due to their phylogenetic and morphological distinctiveness, the family Paradoxornithidae was revived for this group, including the wrentit.

==Distribution==

The wrentit is a sedentary (non-migratory) resident of a narrow strip of coastal habitat along the western coast of North America, being found from Oregon south through California, to Baja California, the northern state of the Baja California peninsula.

It is usually restricted to certain chaparral and woodland habitats. It nests in high shrubs such as poison oak (&quot;Toxicodendron diversilobum&quot;), coyote bush (&quot;Baccharis pilularis&quot;) and California blackberry (&quot;Rubus ursinus&quot;). Logging and other changes in habitat have led to this species expanding its range recently, particularly northwards.

==Ecology==
Wrentits mate for life, forming pair bonds only a few months after hatching. Both sexes sing; the faster rhythm of the male&#x27;s song is one of the few ways to differentiate the sexes. Both sexes also defend their territory year-round and participate in building the nest, a four-stage process that takes about two weeks. The three or four eggs are incubated for 14 days, again by both sexes. The chicks fledge after 15 days (at which stage they are unable to fly) and are fed by their parents for another 40 days.

The wrentit feeds by skulking through dense scrub gleaning exposed insects found by sight. It feeds primarily on beetles, caterpillars, bugs, and ants, but also takes small berries and seeds.

<doc id="1261132" wikidata="Q743726" url="?curid=1261132" title="Hotel (album)">
<text>Hotel is the seventh studio album by American electronica musician, singer, songwriter, and producer Moby. It was released on March 14, 2005, internationally by Mute Records and on March 22, 2005, in the United States by V2 Records. The album marked a stylistic shift from electronic and dance-oriented music towards alternative rock and Moby&#x27;s decision not to use vocal sampling for the first time since his 1993 album &quot;Ambient&quot;.

&quot;Hotel&quot; was met with a mixed critical reception upon release but was a commercial success, reaching No. 28 in the US and No. 8 in the UK. Elsewhere, it reached No. 1 in Belgium and Switzerland. Initial quantities of the album included a second CD of ambient music entitled &quot;Hotel: Ambient&quot;. By 2013, the album had sold over 2 million copies worldwide. In 2014, &quot;Hotel: Ambient&quot; was released with additional tracks.

== Background and writing ==
After touring for his previous album, &quot;18&quot; (2002), ended in 2003, Moby took a detour in musical styles and released &quot;Baby Monkey&quot;, the third album under his Voodoo Child pseudonym, in January 2004. It marked a return to his techno and rave roots, which had brought him success in the early 1990s. At the time of the album&#x27;s release, Moby revealed that he had around 250 songs of varied styles, including electronic, ambient, and experimental pieces, for his next full studio album, but he was unsure as to what direction it should take. His early desire was to make a disco and dance-oriented album. He abandoned this idea for an album of ballads, and wrote between 30 and 40 songs before he decided that the time was not right for such a direction.

Moby drew a large amount of inspiration for &quot;Hotel&quot; from his experiences in living in New York City. The music he heard DJs play in local bars, and the bands he saw perform live at various gigs, made him feel &quot;like I was being given license to bask or wallow in my early influences&quot;. In a departure from his previous albums &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;18&quot;, the album marks Moby&#x27;s first since &quot;Ambient&quot; (1993) which does not include any vocal samples. Though the many songs that he had written did contain them, they did not interest him as much. Moby reasoned this down to the difficulty in learning the sampling function of the audio recording software on his computer, but nonetheless enjoyed writing the songs without relying on them. Moby said the songs on &quot;Hotel&quot; are more personal and direct than on his previous albums. After selecting tracks to record for the album, Moby began to search for vocalists to sing on them, but he was unsuccessful in finding people with voices he liked. The candidates that showed the most potential lacked an emotional quality in their voice.

In a journal entry on his website, Moby explained the title &quot;Hotel&quot;, writing that he was fascinated by the nature of hotels, where humans spend often significant portions of their lives, but have all traces of their tenancy removed for the next guests.

===Moby&#x27;s opinion in retrospect===
In recent years, Moby has stated that &quot;Hotel&quot; is his least favorite of all of the albums he has made. In an interview with &quot;Q&quot;, Moby said that although the production was &quot;very slick and very professional&quot;, he was dissatisfied with the final product once it was done. He explained: &quot;I like some of the songs, but I produced it in such a generic way that I was really kinda disappointed with myself as a producer and as a musician.&quot;

In a 2011 interview, Moby recalled that he felt that while making the album, he was more focused on the fame aspect after the unexpected success with &quot;Play&quot; and wanted to produce an album that had the potential to be commercially successful.

In his 2019 memoir &quot;Then It Fell Apart&quot;, Moby recounts his disappointment with the album in chapter 42, writing how at the time he was more concerned with his level of fame and had alienated many of his friends due to his escalating alcoholism and substance abuse:Back in my suite at the Landmark I put on my headphones and went for a walk up and down the carpeted hallways of the hotel, listening to my new album. In terms of recording, mixing, and engineering, &quot;Hotel&quot; was impeccable. But during the third song, &quot;Beautiful,&quot; I knew that a lot of the bad reviews were right: it was missing something. I&#x27;d traded my battered little bedroom studio for expensive rooms filled with the best equipment on the planet, and the result was a compromised album. It had a few moments of beauty, but I didn&#x27;t love it.

I kept listening, and my panic skyrocketed. I realized I&#x27;d made a mistake in releasing &quot;Hotel&quot;. A mistake that had now been shipped around the world for millions of people to experience firsthand. I wanted to buy all of the millions of CDs that had been shipped, bury them in Nevada, and rerecord all the songs on the cheap equipment in my little studio on Mott Street.

== Recording ==
&quot;Hotel&quot; was recorded in sections in the space of a year and a half. Moby recorded it using ProTools software. Around three-quarters of the album, including the vocals and electronic instrumentation, was recorded at his home studio on Mott Street in Manhattan, New York City. The live drums were put down at Electric Lady Studios, and other tracks, including most of the guitars, were recorded at Loho Studios, both in Manhattan. Moby decided to record in outside studios due to the quality of the recording rooms and the microphones available. The latter housed a large Neve console, assembled from the parts of four to five other Neve models. Mixing was completed at Electric Lady Studios, onto half-inch analogue tape, using a Solid State Logic J-Series desk.

Moby is responsible for playing the instruments on all the album&#x27;s tracks, except for drums. Laura Dawn provides additional vocals. The guitars used on the album include an acoustic, a Carlo Robelli model that Moby estimated cost $180, and a Les Paul Goldtop.

==Songs==
Moby wrote &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; as a tribute to the English rock band The Sisters of Mercy. He made an attempt to have their lead vocalist Andrew Eldritch sing it but he was unsuccessful in his search to contact Eldritch. &quot;Spiders&quot; is an homage to David Bowie. He expanded on the song&#x27;s meaning: &quot;It&#x27;s inspired by the anthropological seeds of fascism, and how easy it is for intellectuals to turn off the intellect and get lost in the crowd.&quot; He clarified that its uplifting chorus is more &quot;quizzical&quot; in how easy it is for one to get &quot;lost in the moment&quot;. &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; and &quot;Raining Again&quot; contain additional background vocals by Shayna Steele. The latter is about a relationship that is falling apart, while the world is crumbling around them too. &quot;When You End&quot; is a sad song about a relationship that ends despite his still being in love with the person. &quot;Dream About Me&quot; is another song about being in a flawed, yet loving relationship. &quot;Beautiful&quot; is a love song. &quot;Temptation&quot; is a cover of the song by New Order. Moby declared &quot;Slipping Away&quot; as the most personal song he had written up to this point in his career. &quot;It&#x27;s not really about anything in particular. It&#x27;s not about a specific event ... It&#x27;s just like emotionally descriptive.&quot; &quot;Very&quot; is a song that Moby described as his homage to Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer.

== Release ==
&quot;Hotel&quot; was released internationally on March 14, 2005; its US release followed on March 22. The lead single was &quot;Lift Me Up&quot;, released on February 28, 2005. The second UK single, &quot;Spiders&quot;, was released on May 23, 2005, to coincide with Moby&#x27;s UK tour.

As with Moby&#x27;s previous albums &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;18&quot;, an accompanying DVD for &quot;Hotel&quot; was later released, featuring the videos for the album&#x27;s singles, live footage, and a sequel to Moby&#x27;s home movie and tour diary series, &quot;Give an Idiot a Camcorder&quot;.

The bonus disc of &quot;Hotel,&quot; titled &quot;Hotel: Ambient&quot;, which consisted of ambient music, was later re-released as a separate release on December 16, 2014. The release contains remastered versions of all songs on the original, together with three extra tracks: &quot;May 4 Two&quot;, &quot;Spaired Long&quot;, and &quot;Live Forever (Long)&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Hotel&quot; received generally mixed reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 47, based on 24 reviews, which indicates &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Critics gave a lukewarm reaction to the album&#x27;s first disc, which they felt was mostly &quot;predictable&quot; and &quot;generic&quot;, while most of the praise went towards the second disc comprising ambient techno: AllMusic calling it the record&#x27;s &quot;saving grace&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; complimenting its &quot;ethereal&quot; instrumentals. Andy Kellman from AllMusic observed that &quot;Hotel&quot; shows little inspiration from Moby&#x27;s previously advertised new wave and post-punk era, while criticizing his decision to hold off from sampling, which he felt led to an album with &quot;all valley and no peaks&quot;, but nevertheless praised the &quot;lovely&quot; opening and closing tracks. Not all critics opposed Moby&#x27;s decision to abstain from sampling; Christian Hoard from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; considered the &quot;nostalgic&quot; songs to &quot;transmit singer-songwriter warmth and clarity through textures that effuse autumnal beauty&quot;, despite their feeling relatively sparse, and the slower tracks &quot;[vaguing] out&quot;. On the other hand, Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was unimpressed with Moby&#x27;s &quot;detached, deadpan&quot; vocals, which leave most of the tracks as &quot;surface decorations&quot;. He felt that although it sounds more &quot;natural&quot;, its essence was instead &quot;less organic and more calculated&quot;, thus showing the album&#x27;s &quot;insistence on being liked&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, David Peschek also commented on the record&#x27;s vocals, feeling that the &quot;cumulative vocal pallor&quot; and &quot;bizarrely cliched ideas&quot; make for a &quot;wan listen&quot;.

Eric Henderson from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; further compared the record to a chain of hotels, writing: &quot;[&quot;Hotel&quot;] is one identical room/song after another. Same furnishings, same instrumentation, same emotionless façade.&quot; Nick Cowen of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; felt similarly about the album&#x27;s &quot;bland and instantly forgettable&quot; tone, while disapproving of the &quot;unbelievably bad&quot; cover of &quot;Temptation&quot;, which he wrote was too &quot;stripped down&quot; and slow. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s Rob Mitchum was most critical of &quot;Hotel&quot;, pointing out that the record &quot;strikes the same mood of one-way-street sloganeering&quot; consisting of &quot;simple, familiar, and recycled&quot; imagery, which dropped Moby to a &quot;blank manufacturer of rock-by-numbers&quot;, devoid of his previously distinguishing characteristics.

However, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Doug Brog was more positive towards the album, commending Moby&#x27;s &quot;appealing cheekiness&quot; among the songs, especially with the &quot;big-chorus soft rock&quot; of &quot;Slipping Away&quot;. Andy Battaglia from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; agreed that &quot;Hotel&quot; still &quot;holds out a few touching glimmers&quot;, with songs like &quot;Slipping Away&quot;, which is carried by a &quot;robust melodic hook&quot;, coupled with the &quot;sexy, mysterious production and breathy vocals&quot; on &quot;I Like It&quot;.
