<text>The Witches&#x27; Water () is a theme park at the middle station of the cable car at Söll in Tyrol, Austria. The central part is a water park consisting of ponds and rivulets where children can play a variety of water games. It extends over an area of about 500 meters and is complemented by various alpine restaurants, playgrounds and a petting zoo.

There are some themed trails in the surrounding area, for instance a witches&#x27; trail tracing past legends; a panoramic trail in front of the Tyrolese limestone alps; or a mile&#x27;s barefoot hiking trail featuring opportunities for different kinds of sensory experience. Guests can also visit a dairy, a distillery or experience apiculture. They can also hike to the panorama restaurant at the top of the mountain.

<doc id="1263239" wikidata="Q886075" url="?curid=1263239" title="Bluesnarfing">
<text>Bluesnarfing is the unauthorized access of information from a wireless device through a Bluetooth connection, often between phones, desktops, laptops, and PDAs (personal digital assistant). This allows access to calendars, contact lists, emails and text messages, and on some phones, users can copy pictures and private videos. Both Bluesnarfing and Bluejacking exploit others&#x27; Bluetooth connections without their knowledge. While Bluejacking is essentially harmless as it only transmits data to the target device, Bluesnarfing is the theft of information from the target device.

For a Bluesnarfing attack to succeed, the attacker generally needs to be within a maximum range of 10 meters from the target device. In some cases, though, attackers can initiate a Bluesnarfing attack from a greater distance.

==Description==
Bluesnarfing exploits vulnerabilities in the object exchange (OBEX) protocol used for Bluetooth device communication, involving hackers who use tools like Bluediving to detect susceptible devices. Once a vulnerable device is identified, hackers establish a connection and employ Bluesnarfing tools to extract data. These tools, available on the dark web or developed by hackers, enable attackers to access sensitive information from compromised devices.

Any device with its Bluetooth connection turned on and set to &quot;discoverable&quot; (able to be found by other Bluetooth devices in range) may be susceptible to Bluejacking and possibly to Bluesnarfing if there is a vulnerability in the vendor&#x27;s software. By turning off this feature, the potential victim can be safer from the possibility of being Bluesnarfed; although a device that is set to &quot;hidden&quot; may be Bluesnarfable by guessing the device&#x27;s MAC address via a brute force attack. As with all brute force attacks, the main obstacle to this approach is the sheer number of possible MAC addresses. Bluetooth uses a 48-bit unique MAC Address, of which the first 24 bits are common to a manufacturer. The remaining 24 bits have approximately 16.8 million possible combinations, requiring an average of 8.4 million attempts to guess by brute force.

==Prevalence== 
Attacks on wireless systems have increased along with the popularity of wireless networks. Attackers often search for rogue access points, or unauthorized wireless devices installed in an organization&#x27;s network and allow an attacker to circumvent network security. Rogue access points and unsecured wireless networks are often detected through war driving, which is using an automobile or other means of transportation to search for a wireless signal over a large area. Bluesnarfing is an attack to access information from wireless devices that transmit using the Bluetooth protocol. With mobile devices, this type of attack is often used to target the international mobile equipment identity (IMEI). Access to this unique piece of data enables the attackers to divert incoming calls and messages to another device without the user&#x27;s knowledge.

==Response==
Bluetooth vendors advise customers with vulnerable Bluetooth devices to either turn them off in areas regarded as unsafe or set them to undiscoverable. This Bluetooth setting allows users to keep their Bluetooth on so that compatible Bluetooth products can be used but other Bluetooth devices cannot discover them.

Because Bluesnarfing is an invasion of privacy, it is illegal in many countries.

==Bluesniping==
&quot;Bluesniping&quot; has emerged as a specific form of Bluesnarfing that is effective at longer ranges than normally possible. According to &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, this method surfaced at the Black Hat Briefings and DEF CON hacker conferences of 2004 where it was shown on the G4techTV show &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;. For example, a &quot;rifle&quot; with a directional antenna, Linux-powered embedded PC, and Bluetooth module mounted on a Ruger 10/22 folding stock has been used for long-range Bluesnarfing.

== In popular culture ==
In the TV series &quot;Person of Interest&quot;, Bluesnarfing, often mistakenly referred to as Bluejacking in the show and at other times forced pairing and phone cloning, is a common element in the show used to spy on and track the people the main characters are trying to save or stop.

<text>France 24 ( in French) is a French state-owned publicly funded international news television network based in Paris. Its channels, broadcast in French, English, Arabic and Spanish, are aimed at the overseas market.

Based in the Paris suburb of Issy-les-Moulineaux, the service started on 6 December 2006. It is aimed at a worldwide market and is generally broadcast by pay television providers around the world, but additionally, in 2010, France 24 began broadcasting online through its own iPhone and Android apps. It is a provider of live streaming world news which can be viewed via its website, YouTube, and various mobile devices and digital media players. The stated mission of the channels is to &quot;provide a global public service and a common editorial stance&quot;.

Since 2008 the channel has been wholly owned by the French government, via its holding company France Médias Monde, having bought out the minority share of the former partners: Groupe TF1 and France Télévisions. The budget of France Médias Monde (France 24, RFI and MCD) is approximately €300 million per year. The current director of France 24 is Vanessa Burggraf.

== Programming ==

France 24 is broadcast on four channels: in French, in English, in Arabic and in Spanish. Their playout is outsourced to Red Bee Media.

France 24&#x27;s programming is divided more or less equally between news coverage and news magazines or special reports.

Along with 260 journalists of its own, France 24 can call on the resources of the two main French broadcasters (Groupe TF1 and France Télévisions) as well as partners such as AFP and RFI.

In 2016, France 24 started sharing its French language night-time programming with the France-based France Info. According to Marie-Christine Saragosse, president and CEO of France Médias Monde, &quot;part of the value added of this public channel&quot; would be the fact that &quot;[France 24 journalists] will be wide awake while others would be sleeping&quot;.

==History==

===Channel inception===
The channel was created with the backing of president Jacques Chirac, with the aim of providing a French perspective of the news, which was dominated by English-language media outlets.

===First project (1986–1999)===
In 1986, then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac expressed his desire for an international television news channel in French and had requested a report into the activities of current international broadcasts from France (Radio France Internationale, TV5, and to a certain extent Réseau France Outre-Mer) and noted the collective offering was &quot;fragmented, disorganised and ineffective.&quot;

With the arrival of François Mitterrand as president in 1981 and the naming of Michel Rocard as Prime Minister in 1989, the government launched a new project, (CFI), a package of programmes aimed at making programmes in French for foreign audiences, particularly in Africa, to be developed in parallel as a television channel.

The First Gulf War of 1990, relayed across the world by CNN International in particular, revealed the power of international news channels and their role in the formation of opinion. A parliamentary minister, Philippe Séguin, wished to create a French-language equivalent.

In 1996 to 1999, after nineteen governmental reports in ten years, Prime Minister Alain Juppé asked Radio France Internationale president Jean-Paul Cluzel (who was also General Inspector of Finances) to create a French international news channel. Cluzel proposed in 1998 to group TV5, RFI, and CFI within a corporation entitled Téléfi. The UMP-led government decided to follow that recommendation but, with the return of the Socialist Party to government and the nomination of Hubert Védrine, the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, favoured the augmentation of existing outlets such as TV5, which started to produce its own programming, notably its news bulletins, which in turn created its own news team.

Additionally with the creation of EuroNews in 1993 (with French-language commentary), the media presence of France overseas became more complex, more fragmented, and costlier, without being able to rely on a true round-the-clock international news channel.

===Relaunched project (2000–2004)===
In 2002, President Jacques Chirac relaunched the project to create a French international news channel:

On 7 March, speaking in the French Senate in front of foreign delegates to France, and as part of his presidential campaign, Chirac said, &quot;We must have the ambition of a big, round-the-clock news channel in French, equal to the BBC or CNN for the English-speaking world. It is essential for the influence of our country. For our expatriates, it would be a live and an immediate link to the mainland&quot;

After his reelection, the first reflections were engaged at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, headed by Dominique de Villepin. Various technical options were examined at the time, in an unreleased report:

* The purchase of EuroNews by the French state
* Creation of an external channel, proposed by then-France Télévisions President Marc Tessier, approved by the previous government
* An international version of LCI, proposed by Groupe TF1, which asked for a state subvention for the service
* Strengthening TV5&#x27;s news service, as suggested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

The subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq reassured the authorities about the project, especially in February 2003, when the American broadcasters CNN, FOX News, and MSNBC opted not to broadcast the long applause given by the members of the United Nations Security Council after Dominique de Villepin gave his address on the Iraq conflict.

On 19 March 2003, Matignon opened offers to:
Elicit the development of an international news channel. Broadcasting primarily in the French language, this service will assure a more important and more visible presence of France in the worldwide battle of images, and to contribute to the pluralism of international information by offering to our viewers the choice of a different viewpoint on the news, marked by a singular point of view of our country on world affairs, by its culture and by its own ideas, and to value its historical links and its privileged geography. The international news channel must contribute to a long-lasting strategy of influence of France in the world.

By the application deadline on 22 April 2003, three candidates replied:
* France Télévisions and RFI: to operate a channel entirely run by the public service sector;
* Groupe TF1: proposed an international version of its LCI channel;
* Groupe Canal+: proposed a news &quot;factory&quot; to reinforce its i&gt;Télé channel, already seen in 47 countries but running at a financial loss.

One month later, a parliamentary commission gave its conclusion, voted with a unanimous decision by its members in the National Assembly, to form a public-owned corporation &quot;(groupement d&#x27;intérêt public)&quot; grouping all of the public broadcasters (France Télévisions, RFO, RFI, TV5 and AFP) with the goal of launching the channel at the end of 2004.

Ignoring the work of the parliamentary commission, the government asked a member of the assembly, Bernard Brochand, to form a partnership between the applying candidates for the international channel, something which the parliamentary commission did not demand. Brochard unsuccessfully attempted to group both Groupe TF1 and Groupe Canal+. He then proposed a 50/50 partnership between France Télévisions and Groupe TF1 (whilst at the same time rejecting RFI), both groups possessing the technical means and experience of broadcasting externally: TF1 with its LCI channel and France Télévisions&#x27; editorial teams at France 2 and France 3.

===Preparing for launch (2004–2006)===

====Defying parliament====
After a press conference in January 2004, President Chirac wished for a launch of the channel towards the end of the year. However, various disputes began to surface. The ministers of the assembly that voted were angry that the recommendations voted for in the parliamentary commission were thrown out in favour of one prepared outside the parliamentary framework. Unionised journalists working for France Télévisions denounced the potential alliance with the private sector, calling it &quot;the marriage of the snake and the rabbit&quot;; Radio France International was angry that it would not be associated with the project. A headline published in &quot;Le Monde&quot; described the partnership having a &quot;public channel, private owner&quot;, while other sections of the press criticised its modest budget of 80 million euro (compared with 600 million euro for BBC World). Finally the Minister for Foreign Affairs had worried that the budget would take away from existing funded channels such as TV5.

Facing discontentment, the cabinet of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin delayed all discussion of the project in 2004. Then Foreign Minister Michel Barnier announced on 21 July that the channel would not be funded before 2007, which was confirmed by a vote in parliament on the Finance Bill.

However, the Prime Minister acceded to pressure from the Élysée; a press conference by Raffarin on 9 December confirmed the launch of the new news channel in 2005, &quot;I have decided to accept the proposed joint venture proposed by France Télévisions and TF1. As desired by the President, the new channel will draw on the talents of major French television companies, and will promote the expression of a French vision, more necessary than ever in the world today. The Government will present an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the start of the channel, to a total of 30 million euro.&quot; The amendment was carried the same day in the National Assembly.

====Public-private angst====
The start of 2005 concerned obtaining the authorisation necessary from the European Union and the relevant competition commissions. Trade union members working for France Télévisions continued to voice opposition to the project and circulated a petition in March 2005. The newly elected president of the public corporation, Patrick de Carolis, who assumed his position in the summer (and who had been accused of being too close to the President), expressed doubts about an alliance with TF1, &quot;To be effective, you need a single driver in a car&quot;.

He insisted that the channel be made available within France, which the members of parliament required, and which TF1, wanting to protect its own news channel LCI, could object to. Patrick Le Lay, president of TF1, gave his blessing for the channel to be broadcast domestically and wished the direction of the channel to alternate every six months between the two parties, and eventually a supervisory board devolved to France Télévisions. These few amendments needed new authorisation from the French and European authorities, obtained this time round without difficulty.

===Birth (2006–2008)===
The launch of the channel was made official after a statement to the cabinet of the Ministry of Culture and Communication, headed by Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres on 30 November 2005, &quot;The project of the International French News Channel (abbreviated in French to CFII)[...] will allow us to propose our own country&#x27;s vision of world events and to reinforce its presence in the world.&quot;

Alain de Pouzilhac, former CEO of Havas, was named president, along with two deputies, one each from group partners TF1 and France Télévisions.

Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin declared that CFII, against the wishes of TF1, would be broadcast within mainland France. However, TF1 wished to launch its news channel LCI onto the digital terrestrial platform. In order to placate TF1, CFII was due to be broadcast via satellite and cable.

On 22 April 2006, &quot;Le Monde&quot; announced that the managers of the forthcoming channel found its initial name difficult to pronounce (CFII, in French pronounced as &quot;C-F-I-I&quot; or &quot;C-F-2-I&quot;). A new name was announced on 30 June 2006, &quot;France 24&quot; (pronounced &quot;France vingt-quatre&quot;). This decision was taken by the supervisory board, chaired by France Télévision president Patrick de Carolis, who made the choice from a list of five potential names.

France 24 launched on 6 December 2006 at 20:30 CET, initially available online as a web stream, followed by satellite distribution a day later, covering France and the rest of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the United States (specifically airing in New York State and the District of Columbia using two channels: one in English and the other in French). Since April 2007 the channel increased its reach, airing programmes in Arabic for viewers in the Maghreb, North Africa and the Middle East. 

Two months after launch, a survey conducted by TNS Sofres indicated that 75% of respondents in France questioned thought France 24 was &quot;useful and essential&quot;, but questions have arisen concerning the France 24 name being too Franco-centric for an international news channel.

====State takes over====
In 2008 Groupe TF1 ceded its share in the channel to a government-owned holding company, Société de l&#x27;audiovisuel extérieur de la France (AEF), whilst conversely committing to producing programmes for the channel until 2015.

Despite the launch of France 24, the fragmentation of public broadcasting overseas continues. The total budget for external broadcasting from France totalled 300 million euro each year. Following the election of Nicolas Sarkozy as president in May 2007, a &quot;steering committee&quot; of twenty members was called in with view to reform in June 2007. President Sarkozy called on Bernard Kouchner and Christine Albanel, respectively Foreign Minister and Culture Minister to reform the current system. The proposition of reform was met with concern from Belgium, Switzerland and Canada/Québec, as the public broadcasters involved in TV5 (of which the French government holds a 49% share whilst the three aforementioned countries hold 11% each) consider TV5 to be a promoter of the wider French-language world. Just one month after France 24&#x27;s launch, TV5 renamed itself TV5Monde.

As published in the &quot;Journal Officiel de la République Française&quot; of 23 January 2009, a Decree for 23 January 2009 appeared, &quot;authorising the company France Télévisions to cede its share in the capital of the France 24 company&quot;. The same Decree transferred its share to the &quot;Société de l&#x27;audiovisuel extérieur de la France&quot; (AEF), which made AEF sole shareholder of France 24, for the sum of 4 million euro.

===Under one &quot;maison&quot; (2008–present)===
President Nicolas Sarkozy announced on 8 January 2008 that he was in favour of reducing France 24&#x27;s programming to French only.

In January 2012 AEF announced a merger between France 24 and Radio France International, a procedure finalised on 13 February 2012. It is expected that staff from Radio France International (which includes Arabic sister-station Monte Carlo Doualiya) will move to premises currently home to France 24. Alain de Pouzilhac, president of AEF stated in &quot;Le Monde&quot;, &quot;We have just created a French audiovisual group of international dimensions, that aspires to be powerful and ambitious; [the merger] is irreversible and is definitive&quot;

102 posts, of which 85 from RFI, were cut preceding the official merger. Editorial teams, technical and distribution, financial and human resources departments of both France 24 and RFI were involved. On 13 February 2012 the merger of France 24 and RFI was made official.

A new logo and graphics package was unveiled on 12 December 2013, updating the 2006 logo; however, the symbol has remained, but the shape was turned into a square. And the new graphic device is the shade of white and blue, that they move left or right, at the end of each promo and on-air graphics. On screen, a black tickerbar shows every top story in order, and on the white bar, it says the name of the website, which is &quot;FRANCE24.COM&quot; in capital letters. At the same time, new intros were given for its News, Weather, and other programmes. While on 1 June 2015, on 10:00 and 17:00, the News from France 24 will have access to audio description for visually and hearing impaired equipment.

===Long-term goals===
France 24 aims to compete with leading English-language international news channels BBC World News and CNN International. Its intention is to put more emphasis on debate, dialogue and the role of cultural differences. It also competes with Deutsche Welle, Al Jazeera English, and NHK World news channels. The Arabic programming competes with Al Jazeera&#x27;s Arabic service, RT Arabic, BBC Arabic and Sky News Arabia. A new Spanish channel for the Latin American market launched in September 2017, competing with CNN en Español, DW (Español), NTN24, TeleSUR, RT en español and CGTN Spanish.

The French government allocated around €100 million for the project. The European Commission gave the green light to France 24 in June 2006, saying it did not breach European Union state-aid rules.

=== Overnight simulcast ===
From 2 September 2016, France&#x27;s new news channel, France Info, started simulcasting France 24 from midnight to 6am daily, when the channel doesn&#x27;t broadcast live except for newscasts every half-hour.

However, from 20 March 2017, on weekdays, France Info started simulcasting France 24 until 6:30 am, due to the main presenter Laurent Bignolas anchoring the early newscast on France 2 &quot;Le 6h Info&quot;, which isn&#x27;t simulcast on France Info.

==Organisation==
From its creation in 2006 to 2008, France 24 is managed by a management board and a supervisory board. In 2008, the French State bought the shares of the two shareholders for an amount of 2 million euros each. Since then, France 24 has been a chain of the national program company France Médias Monde (formerly Exterior Audiovisual of France), 100% owned by the French State through the Agence des participations de l&#x27;État (APE, ).

Previous directors of France 24 include Marc Saikali.

France 24 has two main sources of funding: the audiovisual license fee, paid by each household equipped with a television, and the state subsidy.

In Australia several of France 24&#x27;s news programs are broadcast on multilingual broadcaster SBS as part of its World Watch programming.

The French, English, Arabic, and Spanish channels are all available live on the France 24 website, broadcast &quot;en direct&quot; (live) in Adobe Flash Video format. On 1 April 2007, the Irish terrestrial channel TG4, which is an Irish-language TV channel, began carrying retransmissions of France 24 overnight. Previously, it had retransmitted Euronews. France 24 was also available on Livestation.

In 2007, France 24 started a VOD service on Virgin Media, allowing customers to access weekly news updates and programmes to watch when they choose. The use of a free application means that France 24 is also available live and VOD on mobile phones throughout the world. An official App for the iPhone has also been released.

In October 2009, France24 relaunched its website France24.com with a complete video archive as well as a video-on-demand service whereby the viewer may watch any of the three channels with the ability to replay the past 24 hours of programming anytime. On 1 March 2010, France 24 released live streaming with experimental automatic transcription in association with Yacast Media, the search engine Exalead, Vocapia Research, and Microsoft.

On 2 March 2010, Iran blocked the news website of this French broadcaster.

On 9 January 2011, France 24&#x27;s English and French channels officially switched to 16:9 widescreen at 02:00 CET, and the Arabic channel switched to widescreen later that day at 06:00 CET. Graphics were modified to fit the new format. The studio design was not altered. The video player at France24.com was also amended to accommodate the new format.

France 24 is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative, which is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface, and has announced that it will launch an HbbTV interactive news service in 2012 via the Astra 19.2°E satellites with support from Orange and SES.

Sri Lanka Telecom Peo TV on channel 27. In Pakistan, the channel is available on most cable systems, PTCL Smart TV and NayaTel.

On 25 September 2017, France 24 launched a Spanish-language channel, whose newsroom is located in Bogotá, Colombia. Its local partner is Televideo. As of May 2020, it broadcasts 18 hours of programming a day (13:00 Paris time/06:00 Bogotá time - 05:00 Paris time/22:00 Bogotá time), and simulcasting the English-language channel during the remaining time (early hours in South America).

On 9 January 2018, France 24 was pulled from Spectrum cable TV.

In 2019, France 24 joined the line-up of channels provided by Channelbox in the UK on Freeview channel 271, joining its feed via the Vision TV Network on channel 264. However, as of 2020, only the French-language version of the news service was being broadcast in the UK.

On 1 August 2020, France 24 was launched on OpenView in South Africa as a replacement for BBC World News.

In August 2021, when the streaming service, France Channel, launched in the United States, the service launched with a partnership with France 24&#x27;s parent holding company France Médias Monde, which allows subscribers of France Channel to watch livestreams of both the English and the French versions of the network.

== Criticism ==
On 27 March 2023, Burkina Faso ordered the cessation of France 24&#x27;s broadcasting on its territory. This decision was made following the airing of an interview with the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Burkinabé authorities accused France 24 of providing &quot;a platform for legitimizing terrorist actions and hate speech propagated to fulfill the malicious intentions of this organization in Burkina Faso.&quot; The announcement was made by government spokesperson Jean-Emmanuel Ouedraogo. The French authorities contested the decision, 
saying they had a &quot;consistent and resolute commitment to press freedom.&quot; A European Union spokesperson also considered this commitment as compatible with the fight against terrorism. The government of Niger also suspended France 24 following the 2023 Nigerien coup d&#x27;état.

On 27 July 2023, the state-owned Algeria Press Service openly criticized the channel in an article, labeling it a &quot;trash channel&quot; and stated it is &quot;controlled by the Élysée&quot;, in response to its reporting on the 2023 North Africa wildfires. The agency accused France 24 of slanted coverage regarding the aid provided and measures taken, focusing solely on the Kabylia region and singling out Algeria, even though the fires affected the wider Mediterranean basin.

<text>Robert Edward Stupak (April 6, 1942 – September 25, 2009) was an entrepreneur who became a Las Vegas casino developer and owner. He was also a poker player, winning titles at the World Series of Poker and the Super Bowl of Poker. He also competed on the World Poker Tour, and various other tournaments, as well as cash games, including High Stakes Poker on GSN. He once played a computer for half a million dollars and won.

==Early life==
Bob Stupak was the son of Chester and Florence Stupak. He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Chester Stupak ran a dice game called the Lotus Club in Pittsburgh for over 50 years. Stupak as a teenager was mainly interested in motorcycle racing, and once ranked third in the world after breaking a speed record.

==Career==
Following army service at Fort Knox, Stupak started a coupon book company in 1964, at age 22, offering two-for-one restaurant discounts, which he relocated to Australia in 1965. Stupak moved back to Las Vegas in 1971, where he purchased the Chateau Vegas restaurant near the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Stupak bought a parcel north of Sahara Avenue at Las Vegas Boulevard South. On March 31, 1974, Bob Stupak&#x27;s World Famous Historic Gambling Museum opened. &quot;The name was about longer than the casino&quot;, Stupak recalled years later. On May 21, an air conditioner caught fire and the building burned down.

Two years later, Valley Bank&#x27;s Perry Thomas loaned Stupak a million dollars to build the original Vegas World on the site of the former gambling museum. In 1979. Stupak opened Bob Stupak&#x27;s Vegas World hotel and casino known for its promotions and the world&#x27;s largest sign (which later blew down in a wind storm), and new twists on games, including the world&#x27;s first quarter million and million dollar jackpot. At its peak in the mid-1980s, Vegas World grossed in excess of $100 million per year. 

He bought the Vault casino at 22 Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas and changed its name to Glitter Gulch, which opened in October 1980. A cowgirl sign above named Sassy Sally, later Vegas Vickie, became well-known as the 1994 mock bride of Vegas Vic sign at the Pioneer Club. The sign (subsequently, above strip club Girls of Glitter Gulch) was dismantled in 2017 for redevelopment of the site, and the 20-foot Vegas Vickie sign was given a new home and namesake cocktail lounge at the new Circa Resort &amp; Casino.

Stupak donated $100,000 to the United Negro College Fund in exchange for a chance to play with the Harlem Globetrotters. He got his wish, and his appearance on the court in a Globetrotters uniform during one of their games shooting hoops made international news.

Then, taking a page from Donald Trump with his , Stupak came up with his own board game he called &quot;Stupak&quot; after Trump declined his million dollar challenge for charity playing &quot;Trump: The Game&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, Stupak was inducted into the Gambling Hall of Fame.

Stupak&#x27;s unique promotions included the world&#x27;s first one quarter million dollar jackpot followed shortly thereafter by the world&#x27;s first million dollar jackpot. He also was wildly successful with his direct-mail marketing called the &quot;Vegas Vacation Club&quot; that enticed vacationers to Vegas World with what was almost a cost-free vacation package including room, meals, and vouchers for casino play. Participants returned year after year and spread the word until hotel occupancy was 100% year round. Vegas Vicki was given a new home and namesake cocktail lounge at Circa Resort &amp; Casino.

In 1987, Stupak was considering the purchase of a local television station, as well as starting a weekly newspaper. In 1988, Stupak was the chairman of the newly formed Committee for Olympics in Nevada, and advocated for the Summer Olympic Games to be held in Las Vegas in 1996 or in 2000.

In 1989, Stupak won a widely publicized million-dollar wager on Super Bowl XXIII. Later that year, he won the Deuce to Seven Lowball championship bracelet at the World Series of Poker and the Super Bowl of poker at Caesars Palace, both times edging out world-renowned lowball poker legend Billy Baxter for the championship. One of Stupak&#x27;s most talked about promotions came when he paid a daredevil one million dollars to jump off the top of Vegas World, then charged him a $990,000 landing fee.

In 1990, Stupak approached the mayor and city council with a plan to build the largest free-standing sign in the world. His plan was for an 1,800-foot-tall neon sign that would tower over Las Vegas. Then-Councilman Steve Miller, an airline instructor pilot, convinced Stupak to redesign the structure to include an observation deck. Miller took Stupak for a flight over Vegas World in Miller&#x27;s private plane. There they circled for over an hour at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 feet watching the sun set. Stupak told Miller that to not share such a beautiful sight would be a sin, and he immediately went to work revising his plans to include a restaurant and amusement rides at the top of what was then to be called the &quot;Stupak Tower&quot;. Stupak held a press conference and announced his plan with the caveat that his tower would be the icon of Las Vegas, and Steve Wynn&#x27;s Mirage would be two miles from him, not the other way around. Within a year of Stupak&#x27;s announcement, the construction on the tower began.

On March 31, 1995, Stupak suffered a motorcycle accident, breaking every bone in his face and going into a coma. Although the initial prognosis was that he would not survive, Stupak&#x27;s next of kin, son Nevada Stupak, approved a non-FDA-approved experimental drug to reduce the swelling to his head and brain. Stupak recovered, although with lingering health problems.

At the time of his motorcycle crash, Stupak was developing what had become known as Stratosphere Las Vegas, the largest structure west of the Mississippi and a top 10 tallest structure in the world. The accident was only three weeks after Stupak agreed to bring in fellow poker player buddy Lyle Berman and his company Grand Casinos in as investors in the project, in large part due to the $550 million in capital they agreed to invest. This was Grand Casinos&#x27; big opportunity to enter the Las Vegas market due in large part to the overwhelming success in the Indian gaming market. Stupak called this the most difficult decision of his life as he had never had a partner and was always sole owner. The tower opened in late April 1996, making it the third most expensive casino development in history at the time. Singer Phyllis McGuire, Stupak&#x27;s paramour, pronounced the grand opening &quot;a Stupakular night&quot;. Two months later, Stupak rolled the final dice at The Sands, on June 30, prior to its demolition that November. Within a year of opening, Stupak was out as chairman of the board, and the project ultimately ended as a financial disaster. Stupak personally lost nearly $200 million. He continued to plan Vegas projects, including a purchase of the Moulin Rouge Hotel and a huge hotel shaped like the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, but these endeavors never bore fruit.

Stupak appeared in the first season of the GSN series &quot;High Stakes Poker&quot;. He also appeared at a final table during the first season of the World Poker Tour. He 
starred in an episode of &quot;Crime Story&quot; in 1987, and made numerous film and television series appearances.

In 1999, he was among the inaugural inductees to the Casino Legends Hall of Fame.

As of 2008, his total live tournament winnings exceeded $865,000. With his World Series of Poker Bracelet in the Deuce to Seven Championship and his wife Sandy in the Casino Owner&#x27;s Championship at Binion&#x27;s Horseshoe, they were the first husband-and-wife combo to hold WSOP bracelets.

==Political career==

Stupak ran for mayor of Las Vegas twice. In 1983, Stupak ran against then-current mayor William H. Briare, as well as six other candidates. Stupak came in second place, with 33.1 percent of the vote, losing to Briare, who attained 62.5 percent and won re-election.

Stupak ran for mayor again in 1987, and clashed often with the media. During the campaign, Stupak released financial documents that indicated his net worth at about $54 million. Stupak almost succeeded in being elected mayor. After defeating a dozen other candidates in the primary, Stupak forced an incumbent city council member into a runoff general election contest. Following what many believed was a tampered vote count, Stupak lost the election.

In 2006, Stupak unsuccessfully ran as a Democrat for Lieutenant Governor of Nevada.

==Personal life==
While living in Australia for seven years, Stupak was married, briefly, to Annette Suna, and they had a daughter, Nicole. From 1971 to 1985, Stupak was married to Sandra Joyce Wilkinson (later, Sandy Blumen), and had two more children, Nevada and Summer. During the 1990s, Stupak was romantically linked to Phyllis McGuire of the McGuire Sisters.

==Death and legacy==
Stupak died of leukemia on September 25, 2009, at 67.

In February 2016, the Las Vegas Planning Commission and the Las Vegas City Council unanimously approved the renaming of one block of Baltimore Avenue as Bob Stupak Avenue. The renaming occurred on Stupak&#x27;s birthday, April 6, 2016, as part of a 20th anniversary celebration held for the Stratosphere on the property&#x27;s south side, near the corner of Baltimore Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard.

A community center and a park named after Stupak are located near the Stratosphere. The community center was opened in 1992, and was demolished in 2010, to be replaced by the new Stupak Park. A new Stupak Community Center was opened on January 4, 2010. The new facility is 34,183 square feet and cost $7.5 million to construct. The community center celebrated its 25th anniversary in January 2017.

On his passing, in 2009; College of Southern Nevada history professor Michael Green observed that &quot;The best way to describe him is as a 20th century version of P.T. Barnum&quot; and &quot;He was a visionary, and what he envisioned, he achieved.&quot;

<text>The Birmingham Symphony Orchestra was a professional symphony orchestra based in Birmingham, England between 1906 and 1918.

The orchestra was founded as a self-governing organisation run on cooperative lines by musicians from George Halford&#x27;s Orchestra, which had been performing annual series of concerts in Birmingham since 1897. George Halford remained the new orchestra&#x27;s Music Director, though he would only conduct half of their concerts. The new body included fifty of the musicians from the previous organisation.

The inaugural concert took place in Birmingham Town Hall on 4 April 1906 and was conducted by Henry Wood, with further concerts in the 1906-1907 season being conducted by Halford, Hans Richter and Landon Ronald, and the &quot;Musical Times&quot; describing as a &quot;splendid concert&quot; a performance conducted by Halford in March 1907. For the 1907-1908 and 1908-1909 seasons concerts by the BSO were promoted under the auspices of the &quot;Birmingham Concerts Society&quot; and took place on Tuesday evenings, conducted by Halford, Frederick Cowen, Charles Stanford, Allen Gill and Henri Verbrugghen. From July 1910 it was the &quot;Birmingham Philharmonic Society&quot; that promoted eight concerts a year featuring the BSO players and conductors including Halford, Wood, Ronald, George Henschel, Vasily Safonov, Thomas Beecham and Fritz Cassirer.

The orchestra also gave popular Saturday night concerts at the Town Hall that continued until 1918, and performed widely alongside many different choral societies with conductors including Edward Elgar, Henry Coward and George Robertson Sinclair.

Although there was no institutional connection between the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the later City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, fifteen of the players who founded the earlier organisation in 1906 would also play with the later orchestra when it was established in 1920.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; ) is a humorous term describing the supposed cultural boundary separating Southern Germany from the northern parts, especially Bavaria from Central Germany.

It is named for the Weisswurst sausage of Bavaria, and has no precise definition. A popular one is the linguistic boundary known as the Speyer line separating Upper German from Central German dialects, roughly following the Main River; another is a line running further south, more or less along the Danube, or between the Main and the Danube, roughly along the 49th parallel north circle of latitude.

<text>Europium(III) chloride is an inorganic compound with the formula EuCl3. The anhydrous compound is a yellow solid. Being hygroscopic it rapidly absorbs water to form a white crystalline hexahydrate, EuCl3·6H2O, which is colourless. The compound is used in research.

==Preparation==
Treating Eu2O3 with aqueous HCl produces hydrated europium chloride (EuCl3·6H2O). This salt cannot be rendered anhydrous by heating. Instead one obtains an oxychloride.
Anhydrous EuCl3 is often prepared by the &quot;ammonium chloride route,&quot; starting from either Eu2O3 or hydrated europium chloride (EuCl3·6H2O) by heating carefully to 230 °C. These methods produce (NH4)2[EuCl5]:

:10 NH4Cl + Eu2O3 → 2 (NH4)2[EuCl5] + 6 NH3 + 3 H2O

:EuCl3·6H2O + &quot;2&quot; NH4Cl → (NH4)2[EuCl5] + 6 H2O

The pentachloride decomposes thermally according to the following equation:
: (NH4)2[EuCl5] → 2 NH4Cl + EuCl3
The thermolysis reaction proceeds via the intermediary of (NH4)[Eu2Cl7].

==Reactions==
Europium(III) chloride is a precursor to other europium compounds. It can be converted to the corresponding metal bis(trimethylsilyl)amide via salt metathesis with lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. The reaction is performed in THF and requires a period at reflux.

: EuCl3 + 3 LiN(SiMe3)2 → Eu(N(SiMe3)2)3 + 3 LiCl

Eu(N(SiMe3)2)3 is a starting material for the more complicated coordination complexes.

Reduction with hydrogen gas with heating gives EuCl2. The latter has been used to prepare organometallic compounds of europium(II), such as bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)europium(II) complexes. Europium(III) chloride can be used as a starting point for the preparation of other europium salts.

==Structure==
In the solid state, it crystallises in the UCl3 motif. The Eu centres are nine-coordinate.

<doc id="1263281" wikidata="Q143970" url="?curid=1263281" title="Market garden">
<text>A market garden is the relatively small-scale production of fruits, vegetables and flowers as cash crops, frequently sold directly to consumers and restaurants. The diversity of crops grown on a small area of land, typically from under to some hectares (a few acres), or sometimes in greenhouses, distinguishes it from other types of farming. A market garden is sometimes called a in the US.

A market garden is a business that provides a wide range and steady supply of fresh produce through the local growing season. Unlike large, industrial farms, which practice monoculture and mechanization, many different crops and varieties are grown and more manual labour and gardening techniques are used. The small output requires selling through such local fresh produce outlets as on-farm stands, farmers&#x27; markets, community-supported agriculture subscriptions, restaurants and independent produce stores. Market gardening and orchard farming are closely related to horticulture, which concerns the growing of fruits and vegetables.

==History==
Traditionally, &quot;market garden&quot; was used to contrast farms devoted to raising vegetables and berries, a specialized type of farming, with the larger branches of grain, dairy, and orchard fruit farming; agricultural historians continue to thus use the term. Such operations were not necessarily small-scale. Indeed, many were very large, commercial farms that were called &quot;gardens&quot; not because of size, but because English-speaking farmers traditionally referred to their vegetable plots as &quot;gardens&quot;: in English whether in common parlance or in anthropological or historical scholarship, husbandry done by the hoe is customarily called &quot;gardening&quot; and husbandry done by the plough as &quot;farming&quot; regardless of the scale of either. A &quot;market garden&quot; was simply a vegetable plot, the produce of which the farmer used to sell as opposed to use to feed his or her family. Market gardens are necessarily close to the markets, i.e. cities, that they serve.

Truck farms produce vegetables for market. The word &#x27;truck&#x27; in Truck farms does not refer to the transportation truck, which is derived from Greek for &quot;wheel&quot;, but rather from the old north French word &quot;troquer&quot;, which means &quot;barter&quot; or &quot;exchange&quot;. The use for vegetables raised for market can be traced back to 1784 and truck farms to 1866.

==Business==
Selling to the wholesale market usually earns 10–20% of the retail price, but direct-to-consumer selling earns 100%. Although highly variable, a conventional farm may return but an efficient market garden can earn in the range, or even higher. However, the size of a market garden has a practical upper bound, while with conventional farming, a farmer can farm vast areas because access to a direct market is not a requirement.

Larger market gardens often sell to such local food outlets as supermarkets, food cooperatives, community-supported agriculture programs, farmers&#x27; markets, fresh food wholesalers, and any other higher-volume channels that benefit from buying a range of vegetables from a single supplier, their freshness allowing for a premium over the revenue from the supermarkets and frequently other local suppliers. A larger market garden can by mixed crop production maintain a sales alternative to the wholesale commodity-style channels often used by farms that specialize in high volumes of a limited number of crops.

Relying on cities for markets, however, can have drawbacks. For example, in England, south Sussex was famous for growing tomatoes for the London market that were delivered by train. The arrival of railways in the 19th century at first stimulated growth of market gardens in certain areas by providing quick access to the city, but it eventually allowed commuting residents to move there and turn many market garden areas into suburbs. Urban sprawl still eats up farmland in urban regions. Buying the rights to develop farmland from the farmers solved this problem in Suffolk County, New York.

==Social role==
In some more affluent countries, including Australia and the United States, market gardening is rated as a high social utility occupation. It is typically taken up by recent immigrant groups for one or two generations, until they can accumulate capital, language and trade skills. The succession of dominant market garden groups in Australia, for example, was – from the early 19th century Anglo-Celtic, people from German-speaking countries, Chinese (after the peak of the gold rushes in mid-late 19th century), then southern European migrants from Italy, Malta and Yugoslavia (before it disintegrated), then southeast Asian migrant and refugee communities following the Vietnam War, such as the Vietnamese and Cambodians.

Involvement in a market garden lets immigrant groups who otherwise have few marketable skills apart from their labour, become actively involved in the market economy. Benefits are that it does not rely on education or language, it adapts well to providing work for extended family groups, and in large market growing regions even wider community support networks. Sharing of knowledge and experience within communities reduces risks, and supports a network of other trades such as carriers, market agents, and heavy machinery contractors, and contract farm labour. Market-gardening land is typically relatively cheap and allows immigrants to purchase land, often with an accompanying residence, far more readily than in urban settings. However, like all agriculture it risks crop failure, market collapse and competition from industrialized broad-acre farming and &#x27;fresh-frozen&#x27; imported produce. Other risks are from hazards such as pesticide use, especially where the market gardeners are not trained in their use or able to read product information. Another consequence is marginalization of the succeeding generation where they are relied upon as the fittest and strongest to succeed in continuing the farm rather than pursue other ambitions and opportunities.

==Alternative lifestyle==
Market gardening has in recent decades become an alternative business and lifestyle choice for individuals who wish to &quot;return to the land&quot;, because the business model and niche allow a smaller start-up investment than conventional commercial farming, and generally offers a viable market (in microeconomics, basic or staple foods are considered as necessities and have highly inelastic demand curves, meaning that consumers will buy them in relatively constant quantities even if prices or incomes vary), especially with the recent popularity of organic and local food. It is in some instances considered hobby farming, although market gardening is a recognized type of farming with a distinct business model that can be significantly profitable and sustainable. There is a spectrum with overlap from with the efforts of amateur gardeners who sometimes sell from home or at markets, as an extension of their pastime, to fully commercial market gardening as the main or sole income stream. The latter requires the most discipline and business sense. Successful practitioners who have written books about it include Eliot Coleman and Jean-Martin Fortier.

==In contemporary North America==

An example of a market garden operation in North America might involve one farmer working full-time on . Most work is done with hand and light power tools, and perhaps a small tractor. Some 20 different crops are planted throughout the season. Hardier plants, like peas, spinach, radish, carrots and lettuce are seeded first, in earlier spring, followed by main season crops, like tomatoes, potatoes, corn, beans, cucumber, onions, and summer squash. A further planting timed for harvest in the cooler fall conditions might include more spinach and carrots, winter squash, cabbage, and rutabaga. Harvesting is done at least weekly, by hand, sometimes with part-time help, and produce is sorted, washed and sold fresh at the local farmers&#x27; market, and from an on-farm stand. A pick-up truck is used for short-distance transport of crops and other farm materials. The workflow is a steady cycle of planting and harvesting right through the growing season, and usually comes to an end in the cold winter months.

A somewhat larger market garden operation, ranging from , may be referred to as intensive mixed vegetable production, although the essential business and farming tasks are the same. Such operations are often run by a full-time farmer or farm family, and a few full-time employees. The tractor is relied upon for many tasks, and manual labor requirements, particularly for setting transplants and harvesting, are often significant, with crews of 10, 20 or more people employed seasonally. This has led in the U.S. to groups of &quot;transient&quot; or &quot;migrant&quot; workers who follow the harvest seasons to different farms across the country. In cooler climates, greenhouses are generally used to produce transplants, and sometimes greenhouse production is extended through winter or with hydroponics. Harvest and post-harvest handling are more sophisticated at the larger scale, with some mechanized harvest and processing equipment, walk-in coolers, and refrigerated delivery vehicles.

<doc id="1263291" wikidata="Q690052" url="?curid=1263291" title="Trebinje">
<text>Trebinje (, ) is a city and municipality in Republika Srpska entity, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the southernmost city in Bosnia and Herzegovina and is situated on the banks of the Trebišnjica river in the region of East Herzegovina. As of 2013, it has a population of 31,433 inhabitants. The city&#x27;s old town quarter dates to the 18th-century Ottoman period and includes the Arslanagić Bridge, also known as Perovića Bridge.

==Geography==

=== Physical geography ===
The city lies in the Trebišnjica river valley, at the foot of Leotar, in southeastern Herzegovina, some by road from Dubrovnik, Croatia, on the Adriatic coast. There are several mills along the river, as well as several bridges, including three in the city of Trebinje itself, as well as a historic Ottoman Arslanagić Bridge nearby. The river is heavily exploited for hydro-electric energy. After it passes through the Popovo Polje area southwest of the city, the river – which always floods in the winter – naturally runs underground to the Adriatic, near Dubrovnik. Trebinje is known as &quot;the city of the sun and plane-trees&quot;, and it is said to be one of the most beautiful cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The city is the economic and cultural center of the region of East Herzegovina.

=== Political geography ===
The Trebinje municipality is located in the most southern part of Republika Srpska and the municipalities of Bileća, Ljubinje, and Ravno in Herzegovina-Neretva Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Trebinje municipality has an area of 904 km2 and makes up 3.68% of the total territory of the Republic of Srpska.

===Climate===
Trebinje experiences a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with heavy precipitation, typical of the southern Adriatic coastal areas.

==History==

===Middle Ages===

Tribulium was the original name for this settlement, and the etymology of it may be analyzed as &quot;tri-bulium&quot;, or the place of the &#x27;three hills&#x27;, from the numeral &#x27;three&#x27; (*trei-) and an appellative derived from the IE root *b(h)eu- &#x27;to swell, puff.

&quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; by Constantine VII (913–959) mentioned Travunija (Τερβουνια). Serbian Prince Vlastimir (r. 830–51) married his daughter to Krajina, the son of Beloje, and that family became hereditary rulers of Travunija. By 1040, Stefan Vojislav&#x27;s state stretched in the coastal region from Ston in the north, down to his capital, Skadar, set up along the southern banks of the Skadar Lake, with other courts set up in Trebinje, Kotor, and Bar.

The town commanded the road from Ragusa to Constantinople, which was traversed in 1096 by Raymond IV of Toulouse and his crusaders. Trebinje diocese has its episcopal seat in Polje near Trebinje. At the end of the 12th century Stefan Nemanja conquered provinces that include Trebinje. Under the name of Tribunia or Travunja it belonged to the Serbian Kingdom and the Serbian Empire. In 1373, Trebinje was taken by the Balšić noble family, and later it was incorporated into the expanded medieval Bosnian state under Tvrtko I in 1377. There is a medieval tower in Gornje Police whose construction is often attributed to Vuk Branković. The old Tvrdoš Monastery dates back to the 15th century.

Under Bosnian rule, Trebinje became part of Kosača noble family domains. It was conquered by Ottoman forces for the first time in 1465, but already in 1470 it was returned to Vlatko Hercegović Kosača. By 1478, the town was finally captured and incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The Old Town-Kastel was built by the Ottomans on the location of the medieval fortress of Ban Vir, on the western bank of the Trebišnjica River. The city walls, the Old Town square, and two mosques were built in the beginning of the 18th century by the Resulbegović family. The 16th-century Arslanagić bridge was originally built at the village of Arslanagić, north of the town, by Mehmed-Paša Sokolović, and was run by Arslanagić family for centuries. The Arslanagić Bridge is one of the most attractive Ottoman-era bridges in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has two large and two small semicircular arches.

Among noble families in the Trebinje region mentioned in Ragusan documents were Ljubibratić, Starčić, Popović, Krasomirić, Preljubović, Poznanović, Dragančić, Kobiljačić, Paštrović, Zemljić and Stanjević.

===Ottoman era===
The burning of Saint Sava&#x27;s remains after the Banat Uprising provoked the Serbs in other regions to revolt against the Ottomans. Grdan, the vojvoda of Nikšić, organized revolt with Serbian Patriarch Jovan Kantul. From 1596, the center of anti-Ottoman activity in Herzegovina was the Tvrdoš Monastery in Trebinje, where Metropolitan Visarion was seated. In 1596, the uprising broke out in Bjelopavlići, then spread to Drobnjaci, Nikšić, Piva and Gacko (see Serb Uprising of 1596–97). The rebels were defeated at the field of Gacko. It ultimately failed due to lack of foreign support.

The hajduks in Herzegovina had in March 1655 carried out one of their greatest operations, raiding Trebinje, taking many slaves and carrying with them out much loot.

On 26 November 1716, Austrian general Nastić with 400 soldiers and 500 hajduks attacked Trebinje, but did not take it over. A combined Austro-Venetian-Hajduk force of 7,000 stood before the Trebinje walls, defended by 1,000 Ottomans. The Ottomans were busy near Belgrade and with hajduk attacks towards Mostar, and were thus unable to reinforce Trebinje. The conquest of Trebinje and Popovo field were given up to fight in Montenegro. The Venetians took over Hutovo and Popovo, where they immediately recruited militarily from the population.

Ottoman rule lasted from 1466 until 1878. The Trebinje region suffered especially in the 16th century, mostly from the hand of uskoks of Senj and various hajduk bands. The calmer period during the Ottoman rule was the 18th century. The Serb elders from Trebinje, together with the people of Nikšić, planned a great uprising in the summer of 1805, under the influence of the First Serbian Uprising. Their project was suppressed by the Ottoman pasha and probably with the help from the local Slavic Muslims.

The Christians of Trebinje, together with the Montenegrins, fought against Napoleon&#x27;s troops and in several conflicts they managed to defeat the French troops, such as the knife fight which took place on 2–3 October 1806 leaving several thousands of French soldiers dead, after which the French withdrew for a while.

Notable participants in the Herzegovina Uprising (1852–62) from Trebinje include Mićo Ljubibratić.

During the Herzegovina Uprising (1875–77), the Bileća and Trebinje region was led by &quot;serdar&quot; Todor Mujičić, Gligor Milićević, Vasilj Svorcan and Sava Jakšić.

===Austria-Hungary===

With the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, many reforms took place. New administrative division was introduced and a large number of Austro-Hungarian troops were located in Trebinje, which was seen as a city of strategic value and position. No factories or bigger investments were made in Trebinje during the AU rule.

After the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand Croat-Muslim volunteer corps (German: Schutzcorp) terrorized Serb civilians of Bogojevići and other villages in Trebinje, which resulted in 83 children killed and 85 adults hanged. Those and related actions resulted in migrations of the local population to Serbia.

During the period of Austro-Hungarian administration (1878–1918), several fortifications were built on the surrounding hills, and there was a garrison based in the town. The imperial administrators also modernized the town, expanding it westwards, building the present main street, as well as several squares, parks, schools, tobacco plantations, etc.

===SFR Yugoslavia (1945–92)===

Trebinje grew rapidly in the era of Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia between 1945 and 1980. It especially developed its hydroelectric potential with dams, artificial lakes, tunnels, and hydroelectric plants. This industrial development brought a large increase in the urban population of Trebinje.

===Bosnian War (1992–95)===
Trebinje was the largest town in Serb-held eastern Herzegovina during the Bosnian War. It was controlled by Bosnian Serb forces from the fall of 1991, and was used as a major command and artillery base by Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) troops besieging the Croatian town of Dubrovnik. In 1992 Trebinje was declared the capital of the self-proclaimed Serbian Autonomous Region of Herzegovina (). Bosniak residents were subsequently conscripted to fight with the JNA and if refused they were executed, and thus they fled the region. Ten of the town&#x27;s mosques were razed to the ground during the war.

<text>Adhesive capsulitis (AC), also known as frozen shoulder, is a condition associated with shoulder pain and stiffness. It is a common shoulder ailment that is marked by pain and a loss of range of motion, particularly in external rotation. There is a loss of the ability to move the shoulder, both voluntarily and by others, in multiple directions. The shoulder itself, however, does not generally hurt significantly when touched. Muscle loss around the shoulder may also occur. Onset is gradual over weeks to months. Complications can include fracture of the humerus or biceps tendon rupture.
The cause in most cases is unknown. The condition can also occur after injury or surgery to the shoulder. Risk factors include diabetes and thyroid disease. 

The underlying mechanism involves inflammation and scarring. The diagnosis is generally based on a person&#x27;s symptoms and a physical exam. The diagnosis may be supported by an MRI. Adhesive capsulitis has been linked to diabetes and hypothyroidism, according to research. Adhesive capsulitis was five times more common in diabetic patients than in the control group, according to a meta-analysis published in 2016.
The condition often resolves itself over time without intervention but this may take several years. While a number of treatments, such as NSAIDs, physical therapy, steroids, and injecting the shoulder at high pressure, may be tried, it is unclear what is best. Surgery may be suggested for those who do not get better after a few months. The prevalence of adhesive capsulitis is estimated at 2% to 5% of the general population. It is more common in people 40–60 years of age and in women.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms include shoulder pain and limited range of motion although these symptoms are common in many shoulder conditions. An important symptom of adhesive capsulitis is the severity of stiffness that often makes it nearly impossible to carry out simple arm movements. Pain due to frozen shoulder is usually dull or aching and may be worse at night and with any motion.

The symptoms of primary frozen shoulder have been described as having three or four stages. Sometimes a prodromal stage is described that can be present up to three months prior to the shoulder freezing. During this stage people describe sharp pain at end ranges of motion, achy pain at rest, and sleep disturbances.
* Stage one: The &quot;freezing&quot; or painful stage, which may last from six weeks to nine months, and in which the patient has a slow onset of pain. As the pain worsens, the shoulder loses motion.
* Stage two: The &quot;frozen&quot; or adhesive stage is marked by a slow improvement in pain but the stiffness remains. This stage generally lasts from four to twelve months.
* Stage three: The &quot;thawing&quot; or recovery, when shoulder motion slowly returns toward normal. This generally lasts from 5 to 26 months.

Physical exam findings include restricted range of motion in all planes of movement in both active and passive range of motion. This contrasts with conditions such as shoulder impingement syndrome or rotator cuff tendinitis in which the active range of motion is restricted but passive range of motion is normal. Some exam maneuvers of the shoulder may be impossible due to pain.

== Causes ==

The causes of adhesive capsulitis are incompletely understood; however, there are several factors associated with higher risk. Risk factors for secondary adhesive capsulitis include injury or surgery leading to prolonged immobility. Risk factors for primary, or idiopathic adhesive capsulitis include many systemic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, stroke, lung disease, connective tissue diseases, thyroid disease, heart disease, autoimmune disease, and Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture. Both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are risk factors for the condition.

=== Primary ===

Primary adhesive capsulitis, also known as idiopathic adhesive capsulitis, occurs with no known trigger. It is more likely to develop in the non-dominant arm.

=== Secondary ===

Adhesive capsulitis is called secondary when it develops after an injury or surgery to the shoulder.

== Pathophysiology ==

The underlying pathophysiology is incompletely understood, but is generally accepted to have both inflammatory and fibrotic components. The hardening of the shoulder joint capsule is central to the disease process. This is the result of scar tissue (adhesions) around the joint capsule. There also may be a reduction in synovial fluid, which normally helps the shoulder joint, a ball and socket joint, move by lubricating the gap between the humerus and the socket in the shoulder blade. In the painful stage (stage I), there is evidence of inflammatory cytokines in the joint fluid. 

The main limiting factor in external rotation is due to the thickening of the coracohumeral ligament, which forms the roof of the rotator cuff and is a primary symptom of adhesive capsulitis. In addition, the coracohumeral ligament attributes to the limitation of internal rotation considering its connection to the supraspinatus and subscapular tendons. As the phases of adhesive capsulitis progress, the glenohumeral (GH) capsule begins to thicken and as a result the contraction of the capsule itself becomes the main reason as to why range of motion will be restricted in all planes of motion.

== Diagnosis ==
Adhesive capsulitis can be diagnosed by history and physical exam. It is often a diagnosis of exclusion, as other causes of shoulder pain and stiffness must first be ruled out. On physical exam, adhesive capsulitis can be diagnosed if limits of the active range of motion are the same or similar to the limits to the passive range of motion. The movement that is most severely inhibited is external rotation of the shoulder.

Imaging studies are not required for diagnosis, but may be used to rule out other causes of pain. Radiographs will often be normal, but imaging features of adhesive capsulitis can be seen on ultrasound or non-contrast MRI. Ultrasound and MRI can help in diagnosis by assessing the coracohumeral ligament, with a width of greater than 3 mm being 60% sensitive and 95% specific for the diagnosis. Shoulders with adhesive capsulitis also characteristically fibrose and thicken at the axillary pouch and &quot;rotator interval&quot;, best seen as a dark signal on T1 sequences with edema and inflammation on T2 sequences. A finding on ultrasound associated with adhesive capsulitis is hypoechoic material surrounding the long head of the biceps tendon at the rotator interval, reflecting fibrosis. In the painful stage, such hypoechoic material may demonstrate increased vascularity with Doppler ultrasound.

Grey-scale ultrasound can play a key role in timely diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis due to its high sensitivity and specificity. It is also widely available, convenient, and cost efficient. Thickening in the coracohumeral ligament, inferior capsule/ axillary recess capsule, and rotator interval abnormality, as well as restriction in range of motion in the shoulder can be detected using ultrasound. The range of motion is prohibited due to scapulohumeral rhythm changes occurring in the shoulder joint. The altered scapular kinematics can restrict anterior and posterior tilting, downward rotation and depression as well as external rotation. All of these restrictions lead the scapula to be excessively upwardly rotated. The restriction of the scapular posterior tilt is due to tightness in the lower serratus anterior, anterior capsule and the pectoralis minor. Downward rotation and depression are restricted due to the tightness of the rhomboids, upper trapezius and the superior capsule. Respective sensitivity values were 64.4, 82.1, 82.6, and 94.3, and respective specificity levels were 88.9, 95.7, 93.9, and 90.9.

== Treatment ==
There is consensus that non-surgical management is the initial treatment of choice for frozen shoulder. There is no strong evidence to favor any particular approach; in fact, some reviews suggest that multi-modal approaches combining several treatments are better. Research in the UK showed that there were three typical approaches to treatment (physiotherapy, manipulation of the shoulder under general anaesthesia, and surgery (arthroscopic capsular release)). All three treatments were deemed effective but they had different benefits and drawbacks, suggesting clinicians and patients should decide together on the most appropriate treatment. 

The effects of most treatments are primarily short-term, focusing on alleviating symptoms such as shoulder pain and reduced joint movement. Common treatments include exercise, physical therapy, oral analgesics such as paracetamol and NSAIDs, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Non-surgical treatment may continue for months, with more complex treatments such as ESWT, movement under analgesia, and hydrodilatation. It is unclear if these treatments lead to a quicker resolution of the disorder, or only manage chronic symptoms. The condition generally resolves itself with or without treatment. If conservative measures have no effect and the condition is long-lasting, or if evidence suggests surgical intervention, there are also several surgical procedures that may alleviate the disorder.

=== Medication ===

Medications such as NSAIDs can be used for pain control. Oral steroids may provide short-term benefits in range of movement and pain but have side effects such as hyperglycemia. Corticosteroids may also be used by local injection. In the short and medium term, intra-articular corticosteroid injections appear most effective in pain alleviation and increase in range of motion, although the injection does carry complications. Unfortunately, the effects of medication are not long-lasting. Oral corticosteroids in particular should not be used consistently to treat adhesive capsulitis, because of the dangers associated with long-term use and the lack of long-term benefit.

=== Exercise and physical therapy ===

Shoulder stretching and strengthening exercises improve shoulder function and decrease pain. When using intra-articular corticosteroid injections, the effects of exercise on short-term relief were not significant, although individual studies found some benefits. Concerning techniques, posterior glenohumeral mobilization had a large effect; mirror therapy, rotator cuff strengthening, spray &amp; stretch, and end range mobilization had moderate results; continuous passive motion, scapular recognition, scapulothoracic exercises, yijin jing, and lower trapezius strengthening had small effects; and electromagnetic therapy, Kaltenborn mobilization, and instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) had insignificant effects compared to control kinesthetic exercises. It has been found that performing exercises under supervision is more effective than unsupervised exercise at home.

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been strongly recommended as a way of reducing pain levels and improving range of motion and functioning in people with Stage 2 and 3 adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. Laser therapy was also found to have these similar effects for people dealing with Stage 2 adhesive capsulitis. Moderate evidence points to improvements in pain management, range of motion and functional status for interventions such as PNF techniques (stretching), continuous passive motion, dynamic scapular stability exercises, and conventional physiotherapy. Low evidence exists for manual muscle release.

Hydrodilatation or distension arthrography is controversial. However, some studies show that arthrographic distension may play a positive role in reducing pain and improve range of movement and function.

Manipulation of the shoulder under general anesthesia to break up the adhesions is sometimes used.

Because adhesive capsulitis is a condition that produces stiffness and causes the capsule of the glenohumeral joint to become thickened and progressively contract, it is important to exercise regularly to increase the range of motion and decrease the pain. Physical therapy is recommended to provide a treatment for the condition. The three stages to adhesive capsulitis are freezing, frozen, and thawing. During the freezing stage, there is a significant increase in pain in the night hours. The Frozen stage is where the shoulder loses its range of motion and becomes stiff. Lastly, the thawing stage is where pain becomes minimal, and range of motion is restored. Exercise increases blood flow to the muscles affected which enhances blood flow.
Regular exercise is a crucial part of the healing stages of adhesive capsulitis. Specific exercises are highlighted to enhance recovery. Another useful tool can be anti-inflammatory medications. These provide temporary relief which aid in exercise exertion. The combination of these techniques allow for the most successful healing process.

Types of Exercise

Various types of exercise go into improving function in the shoulder. Specifically, stretches and strengthening exercises are the most beneficial for treating adhesive capsulitis. Rotator cuff stretches are preferred when constructing an exercise treatment plan. Some specific stretches for the rotator cuff include, the wall press, shoulder roll, retraction of the shoulder blade, etc. ECE (eccentric contraction exercises) is proven to be more effective with pain since the muscle is being elongated.

The combination of scapulothoracic exercises and glenohumeral exercises allow for a more effective healing process. Scapulothoracic exercises focus on movements of the scapula relative to the thoracic ribcage. Muscle groups such as serratus anterior, trapezius, and rhomboid major/minor need to be strengthened to allow for shoulder function. By stabilizing these muscles there is more alignment which causes a reduction in strain and protects the joints. Glenohumeral exercises are focused around strengthening the rotator cuff muscles. The rotator cuff is consisted of subscapularis, infraspinatus, teres minor, and supraspinatus.

Benefits of Exercise

Individuals who suffer from adhesive capsulitis have a higher chance of regaining normal function and stability with the use of exercise. Physical therapy is recommended for those with adhesive capsulitis for quicker regain of function. People who do not exercise with this condition heal slower and are not able to achieve the range of motion or mobility they once had.

Exercise with adhesive capsulitis is beneficial to enhance stability of the joints surrounding the shoulder, a reduction of pain, higher functionality in the shoulders, and an increased range of motion.

=== Surgery ===
If conservative measures are unsuccessful, surgery can be trialed. Surgery to cut the adhesions (capsular release) may be indicated in prolonged and severe cases; the procedure is usually performed by arthroscopy. Surgical evaluation of other problems with the shoulder, e.g., subacromial bursitis or rotator cuff tear, may be needed. Resistant adhesive capsulitis may respond to open release surgery. This technique allows the surgeon to find and correct the underlying cause of restricted shoulder movement such as contracture of coracohumeral ligament and rotator interval.

The most common surgical technique is arthroscopic capsular release surgery, and it is beneficial to individuals who do not get better with physical therapy treatment. Because this type of surgery is minimally invasive, it allows a faster healing time since it consists of small incisions and a small camera to surgically remove the tissue that is thickened and contracted. This surgery is very detailed which also provides more range of motion to the shoulder post operation.

Another key aspect to surgery is the post-surgical rehabilitation phase. During this phase, physical therapy is utilized to regain range of motion and prevent stiffness. Starting out with rehabilitation there is an emphasis on range of motion exercises such as passive and active assisted which provides mobility to the joints while preventing further stress/damage to the tissues healing. The strengthening phase is where the muscles are put under stress of exercises to build strength and muscle for support of the shoulder. Once the strengthening phase is complete, the individual gets reintroduced gradually to activities of daily living and prior training goals.
== Prognosis ==

Most cases of adhesive capsulitis are self limiting, but may take 1 to 3 years to fully resolve. Pain and stiffness may not completely resolve in 20 to 50 per cent of affected people.

== Epidemiology ==
Adhesive capsulitis newly affects approximately 0.75% to 5.0% percent of people a year. Rates are higher in people with diabetes (10–46%). Following breast surgery, some known complications include loss of shoulder range of motion (ROM) and reduced functional mobility in the involved arm. Occurrence is rare in children and people under 40, with the highest prevalence between 40 and 70 years of age. The condition is more common in women than in men (70% of patients are women aged 40–60). People with diabetes, stroke, lung disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or heart disease are at a higher risk for frozen shoulder. Symptoms in people with diabetes may be more protracted than in the non-diabetic population.

<text>Flatbush Avenue is a major avenue in the New York City Borough of Brooklyn. It runs from the Manhattan Bridge south-southeastward to Jamaica Bay, where it joins the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge, which connects Brooklyn to the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens. The north end was extended from Fulton Street to the Manhattan Bridge as &quot;Flatbush Avenue Extension&quot;.

Flatbush Avenue, including the extension, is long. The avenue is a four-lane street throughout the majority of its run. North of Atlantic Avenue and south of Utica Avenue, it is a six-lane-wide median-divided street.

==Effect on street grid==

The diagonal path of Flatbush Avenue creates a unique street pattern in every neighborhood it touches. It is the central artery of the borough, carrying traffic to and from Manhattan past landmarks such as MetroTech Center, City Point, the Fulton Mall, Junior&#x27;s, Long Island University Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Atlantic Terminal, the Barclays Center, Grand Army Plaza, the Brooklyn Public Library, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Prospect Park, Erasmus Hall High School, Kings Theatre, Brooklyn College, Kings Plaza, and Floyd Bennett Field.

Flatbush Avenue is the border of Prospect Heights/Park Slope and many other neighborhoods. Other main Brooklyn thoroughfares start at Flatbush Avenue, including Ocean Avenue and Empire Boulevard (both at Willink Plaza), Linden Boulevard, Eastern Parkway, and Utica Avenue.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, several Native American trails crossed Brooklyn. These were later widened into &quot;ferry roads&quot; by 17th-century Dutch settlers, since they were used to provide transport to the waterfront. One was the Flatbush Road, running roughly north–south to the east of the path of present-day Flatbush Avenue. The road ran roughly along what is now the eastern edge of Prospect Park and taking advantage of a low point in the Heights of Guan that form the spine of Long Island. A monument beside the former Flatbush Road, now inside the park, commemorates an attempt to block the road at Battle Pass during the Battle of Long Island. For much of the 19th century, it had a plank road run by a turnpike company. Historic homes line the neighborhoods around the avenue, which in the late 1920s was straightened to its current form. Streets such as Amersfort Place that are remnants of old parts of the avenue remain in the city grid as an echo of the past.

==Transportation==
Flatbush Avenue is served by the following MTA Regional Bus Operations routes: 
* The serves the majority of the avenue, between Livingston Street and either Avenue V, where Kings Plaza is located, or Avenue N, to serve Bergen Beach.
* The runs south of Avenue I (Brooklyn College), or Avenue H (Rockaway Park, Queens).
* From Kings Plaza heading north, where all three terminate, the and B46 SBS go to Utica Avenue, the goes to Avenue S, and buses that serve the full route go to Avenue L. 
* The local runs on the avenue between Kings Highway and Flatlands Avenue. The B82 SBS does not serve any portion. 
* Northbound B44 SBS buses run from Nostrand Avenue to Rogers Avenue. The local does not serve any portion. 
* When serving the full route, the runs on two portions of Flatbush. One is between Avenue H and either terminates at Nostrand Avenue (Brooklyn College), or continues to Cortelyou Road (Downtown Brooklyn), where it’s accompanied by the express. The other portion is between Livingston Street and either Lafayette Avenue (Downtown Brooklyn), or 4th Avenue (Canarsie). 
* The runs between Glenwood Road and Brooklyn College, where all buses terminate. The uses the avenue to continue along Glenwood, past East 29th Street.
* Prospect Park-bound buses run from Ocean Avenue to Lincoln Road. 
* From 7th Avenue, the heads north to Livingston Street, while the heads south to Plaza Street East.
* The runs between 5th and Atlantic Avenues, west from Flatbush. The runs between Livingston Street and Atlantic, east from Flatbush.
* Ridgewood-bound buses run on the Extension part of the avenue from Tillary Street to Myrtle Avenue. 

A dedicated bus lane corridor on Flatbush Avenue was proposed in 2022; at the time, the B41 route traveled at an average speed of . Work on the bus lanes began in 2024.

Flatbush Avenue is served by the following New York City Subway stations:
* The IRT Nostrand Avenue Line () has a southern terminus at the Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College station. 
* The BMT Brighton Line () and IRT Eastern Parkway Line () run under the avenue between Prospect Park and DeKalb Avenue, and Grand Army Plaza and Nevins Street, respectively.

<text>Fair Lane was the estate of Ford Motor Company founder Henry Ford and his wife, Clara Ford, in Dearborn, Michigan, in the United States. It was named after an area in Cork in Ireland where Ford&#x27;s adoptive grandfather, Patrick Ahern, was born. The estate along the River Rouge included a large limestone house, an electrical power plant on the dammed river, a greenhouse, a boathouse, riding stables, a children&#x27;s playhouse, a treehouse, and extensive landmark gardens designed by Chicago landscape architect Jens Jensen.

The residence and part of the estate grounds are open to the public as a historical landscape and house museum, and preserved as a National Historic Landmark. Part of the estate grounds are preserved as a university nature study area.

==Architecture==
Frank Lloyd Wright participated in the initial design. However, after Wright fled to Europe with his mistress Mamah Borthwick, one of his assistant architects, Marion Mahony Griffin, one of the first female architects in America, revised and completed the design according to her own interpretation of the Prairie Style. Henry Ford and his wife took a trip to Europe and, on their return, dismissed Griffin and used William H. Van Tine to add English Manor house details. In 1913, architect Joseph Nathaniel French was brought in to work on the final stages of the residence, completed in 1915.

The house, with 56 rooms, was considered befitting, but less grand than other great houses and mansions of the era in America. It included an indoor pool and bowling alley. The pool is now covered over and serves as an event and meeting space. It had formerly housed a restaurant.

==Landscape==
The powerhouse had its cornerstone laid by Thomas Alva Edison. The building included the estate&#x27;s garage and, on the upper level, a laboratory where Ford worked on engine designs. It is also built of limestone in the Prairie Style. The hydropower not only powered the estate, but a part of the town of Dearborn as well.

Jens Jensen employed his &quot;delayed view&quot; approach in designing the arrival at the residence. Instead of proceeding straight to the house or even providing a view of it, the entrance drive leads visitors through the estate&#x27;s dense woodland areas. Bends in the drive, planted with large trees on the inside arc of the curves, gives a feeling of a natural reason for the turn, and obscures any long view. Suddenly, the visitor is propelled out of the forest and into the open space where the residence is presented fully in view in front of them. The idea of wandering was one which Jensen featured in almost all of his designs. Expansive meadows and gardens make up the larger landscape, with naturalistic massings of flowers surrounding the house. The largest axial meadow, the &quot;Path of the Setting Sun&quot;, is aligned so that, on the summer solstice, the setting sun glows through a precise parting of the trees at the meadow&#x27;s western end. The boathouse, with stonework cliffs designed by Jensen, allowed Ford to travel on the Rouge River in his electric boat.

==Museum==
The estate was donated to the University of Michigan in 1957 for a new Dearborn campus. The staff&#x27;s former houses and a pony barn are used by the University of Michigan–Dearborn. The main house, powerhouse, garage and 72 acres (0.29 km2) of land were operated as a museum, while a restaurant occupied the former indoor swimming pool natatorium until the University closed Fair Lane to the public in 2010. In 2013 the stewardship of the estate was transferred to the same non-profit group that operates the lakeside Edsel and Eleanor Ford House, with financial help from the Ford family.

==Names==
The private rail car of Henry and Clara Ford, named &quot;Fair Lane&quot;, was kept on standby at the Ford siding of the Michigan Central Railroad in Dearborn. The Ford Fairlane automobile model, sold between 1955 and 1970 in America, and between 1959 and 2007 in Australia, was named after the Fair Lane estate.

<doc id="1263314" wikidata="Q506007" url="?curid=1263314" title="Leonard Starr">
<text>Leonard Starr (October 28, 1925 – June 30, 2015) was an American cartoonist, comic book artist, and advertising artist, best known for creating the newspaper comic strip &quot;On Stage&quot; and reviving &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born October 28, 1925, in New York City, Starr graduated from Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Music and Art and then studied at Pratt Institute.

== Career ==
While attending Pratt during 1942–43, Starr worked for the Harry &quot;A&quot; Chesler and the Funnies, Inc. studios, contributing to the early comic book features produced at these studios. For Funnies, Inc., he began as a background artist, eventually inking Bob Oksner&#x27;s pencils. He graduated to drawing for early Timely/Marvel Comics titles, including the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner.

Throughout the 1940s, Starr worked for a plethora of publishers of both comic books and pulps, including Better Publications, Consolidated Book, Croyden Publications, E. R. Ross Publishing, Fawcett Comics (doing &quot;Don Winslow of the Navy&quot;, 1944–46), Hillman Periodicals and M. C. Combs. He worked with Joe Simon and Jack Kirby on their earlier romance comics titles, in particular the Crestwood/Prize title &quot;Young Romance&quot;.

In the late 1940s, he drew for EC Comics, including &quot;War Against Crime&quot;, before working both as an advertising artist and producing a large amount of work for both the American Comics Group and DC Comics titles during the early to mid-1950s. His DC work spanned a large number of covers, and work on titles as diverse as &quot;Doctor 13&quot;, &quot;House of Mystery&quot;, &quot;Gang Busters&quot;, &quot;Pow-Wow Smith, Indian Lawman&quot; and &quot;Star-Spangled War Stories&quot;, mainly prior to 1957. For ACG, he worked on &quot;Adventures into the Unknown&quot;, &quot;Operation Peril&quot; and &quot;Soldiers of Fortune&quot; among other titles. In 1955–56, he moved from comic books to comic strips with uncredited work on King Features&#x27; &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;.
== &quot;Mary Perkins, On Stage&quot; ==
In 1957, Starr created the comic strip &quot;On Stage&quot;, later titled &quot;Mary Perkins, On Stage&quot; for the Chicago-Tribune-New York News Syndicate. Characterized by a mix of soap opera, adventure and humor, the strip featured tight, realistic graphics and, from the beginning, strong layouts, design and storytelling. He received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Story Comic Strip Award for &quot;On Stage&quot; in 1960 and 1963, and their Reuben Award in 1965. He continued producing &quot;Mary Perkins, On Stage&quot; until 1979. Starr would later cite the work of Alex Raymond and Milton Caniff as influences on the strip&#x27;s artwork.

== Other work ==
Starr returned to comic books very briefly during the 1970s and 1980s, working on &quot;Morbius, the Living Vampire&quot; for Marvel in 1975 and providing art for DC&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the DC Universe&quot; (1986) and for a Superman and Lois Lane story in &quot;Action Comics&quot;. For Dargaud in Paris, he created &quot;Kelly Green&quot; with Stan Drake in 1980. This series of graphic novels about the sexy and capable female action heroine Kelly Green, were illustrated by Drake. In 1985 he wrote and illustrated an action/adventure graphic novel published only in France &quot;Operation Psy&quot; featuring Cannonball Carmody. That same year he was enlisted by artist Frank Bolle to take over writing the strip &quot;Winnie Winkle&quot; (without credit) which he did until its end in 1996. He also ghost wrote &quot;Rip Kirby&quot; as a favor to his friend, artist John Prentice, in the strip&#x27;s final years.

Starr expanded into animation in the 1980s, as he noted, &quot;Started writing television scripts in the early 1970s, and in 1984 I was asked to develop and write the bible for the animated television show &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, and also act as the story editor and head writer. Moved to Westport, Connecticut in 1970 where I still live today.&quot; Starr eventually wrote 23 episodes for &quot;ThunderCats&quot;.

He also worked on the Rankin Bass series &quot;Ghost Warrior&quot; (1985).

In the 1980s Starr attended as a guest several comic conventions held in New York. Also, he was a guest at the 1982 San Diego Comic-Con, at which he received an Inkpot Award.

== &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; ==

In 1979 he revived the comic strip &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;. The strip had been in reprints since 1974 after a string of unsuccessful artists had succeeded the famous creator Harold Gray, who had died in 1968. Retitled &quot;Annie&quot;, Starr&#x27;s incarnation of the strip received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Story Comic Strip Award in 1983 and 1984. Starr continued it successfully until his retirement in 2000.

== Later life ==
Beginning in 2006, Starr produced new artwork for the covers to the ongoing series of &quot;On Stage&quot; reprint volumes published by Classic Comics Press. To publicize the reprints he was a guest at the 2008 New York Comic Con and 2009 San Diego Comic-Con. He died June 30, 2015.

Classic Comics Press has announced plans to publish Cannonball Carmody in English for the first time plus excerpts of sketchbooks from early in Starr&#x27;s career.

<text>Agenais (), or Agenois (), was an ancient region that became a county (Old French: &quot;conté&quot; or &quot;cunté&quot;) of France, south of Périgord.

==History==
In ancient Gaul the region was the country of the Nitiobroges with Aginnum for their capital, which in the fourth century was the Civitas Agennensium, which was a part of Aquitania Secunda and which formed the diocese of Agen. From 833 to 848, all the land seems to have been ravaged by the Vikings. Having in general shared the fortunes of Aquitaine during the Merovingian and Carolingian periods, Agenais from about 886 became an hereditary county in the part of the country now called Gascony (Vasconia). The first count of Agenais (&quot;comte d&#x27;Agen&quot;) was William I of Périgord (d. 920), son of Wulgrin I of Angoulême.

In 1038 this county was purchased by William, Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitiers. The marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine with the future Henry II of England in 1152 brought the county under the sway of the Plantagenet house of Anjou. When Richard Coeur-de-Lion married his sister Joan to Raymund VI, Count of Toulouse, in 1196, Agenais formed part of the princess&#x27;s dowry, and formed part of the other estates of the last independent count of Toulouse. In 1212, during the Albigensian Crusade, Simon de Montfort captured the Cathar fortress of Penne-d&#x27;Agenais and burned Cathars at the stake. At the 1259 Treaty of Paris, Louis IX of France agreed to pay an annual rent to Henry III of England for Louis&#x27; possession of Agenais. The estates of Agenais lapsed to the crown of France in 1271.

This, however, was not for long; the king of France had to recognize the prior rights of the king of England to the possession of the county, and restored it to him in 1279. During the Hundred Years&#x27; War between the English and the French, Agenais was frequently taken and retaken, the final retreat of the English in 1453 at last leaving the king of France in peaceable possession.

In 1561, Guyenne was made a province, and included Bordelais, Bazadais, Limousin, Périgord, Quercy, Rouergue, Agenais, Saintonge, and Angoumois. Thenceforth Agenais was no more than an administrative term. At the end of the Ancien Régime it formed part of the &quot;Gouvernement&quot; of Guienne, and at the Revolution it was incorporated within the département of Lot-et-Garonne, of which it constitutes nearly the whole. The title of count of Agenais, which the kings of England had allowed to fall into desuetude, was revived by the kings of France, and in 1789 was held by the family of the dukes of Richelieu.

<text>Cataraqui Cemetery is a non-denominational cemetery located in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Founded in 1850, it predates Canadian Confederation, and continues as an active burial ground. The cemetery is 91 acres in a rural setting with rolling wooded terrain, ponds and watercourses. More than 46,000 individuals are interred within the grounds, and it is the final resting place of many prominent Canadians, including the burial site of Canada&#x27;s first prime minister, John A. Macdonald. The Macdonald family gravesite, and the cemetery itself, are both designated as National Historic Sites of Canada.

==History==
The cemetery charter was created during a special act of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada on August 10, 1850. The Cataraqui Cemetery was incorporated as a not-for-profit, non-denominational, and public resting place. Alexander Campbell served as the first president. Architect Frederick Cornell designed the cemetery landscape. Interments increased quickly when the City of Kingston passed a by-law in 1864, preventing burials within the city limits. The gravesite of John A. Macdonald and family plot were recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada on May 19, 1938. Cataraqui Cemetery as a whole was recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada on July 19, 2011.

==Notable interments==
Cataraqui Cemetery is the final resting place for many notable persons including politicians, businessmen, humanitarians, and authors. The cemetery contains the war graves of 61 service personnel from World War I, and 84 from World War II. Queen&#x27;s University owns a section that is reserved for interring the remains of those who dedicate their bodies to education and research.

<text>The Unity Bank of Canada was a small Canadian bank that was established in Toronto, Ontario, in 1972. Richard Higgins was president and David Matthews was general manager. It amalgamated with the Provincial Bank of Canada on February 14, 1977.

By September 1975, the bank had 23 branches in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta.

In 1977, the Unity Bank experienced problem loans, and large creditors withdrew funds when they became aware of the bank&#x27;s financial problems. The Bank of Canada advanced funds to provide liquidity support over a three-month period. Historically, very few chartered banks in Canada have experienced liquidity crises.

Journalist Walter Stewart alluded to Unity Bank&#x27;s troubled history in a 1983 speech to the Empire Club:

<text>Harold Lincoln Gray (January 20, 1894 – May 9, 1968) was an American cartoonist, best known as the creator of the newspaper comic strip &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;.

==Early life==
Harold Gray was born in Kankakee, Illinois on January 20, 1894, to Estella Mary () and Ira Lincoln Gray, a farmer. Both parents died before he finished high school in 1912 in West Lafayette, Indiana, where the family had moved. In 1913, he got his first newspaper job at a Lafayette daily. He could trace his American ancestry back to 17th-century settlers. He grew up on farms in Illinois and Indiana, and worked in construction to pay his college tuition at Purdue University. He graduated with a degree in engineering by 1917.

Gray approached cartoonist John T. McCutcheon for advice on breaking into the cartooning field. He could not immediately get cartooning work, but McCutcheon&#x27;s influence got him work as a reporter for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; before he enlisted in the military for World War I, where he was a bayonet instructor for six months. Discharged from the military, he returned to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and stayed until 1919 when he left to freelance in commercial art. In 1923, while residing in Lombard, Illinois, he became a Freemason.

==Comic strips==
From 1921 to 1924, he did the lettering for Sidney Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Gumps&quot;. After he came up with a strip idea in 1924 for &quot;Little Orphan Otto&quot;, the title was altered by &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; editor Joseph Medill Patterson to &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;, launched August 5, 1924.

Gray&#x27;s first wife, Doris C. Platt, died in late 1925. He married Winifred Frost in 1929, and the couple moved to Greens Farms, Connecticut, spending winters in La Jolla, California.

By the 1930s, &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; had evolved from a crudely drawn melodrama to a crisply rendered atmospheric story with novelistic plot threads. The dialogue consisted mainly of meditations on Gray&#x27;s own deeply conservative political philosophy. Gray made no secret of his dislike for the New Deal ways of President Franklin Roosevelt and would often decry unions and other things he saw as impediments to the hard-working American way of life. Critic Jeet Heer, who did his thesis on Gray and wrote introductions to IDW&#x27;s &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; collections, commented:

Gray wasn&#x27;t really a conservative in the 1920s: he was more of a general populist, hostile to loan sharks and speculators while celebrating hard working ordinary people whether they&#x27;re successful (&quot;Daddy&quot; Warbucks) or not (the poor struggling farmers, the Silos). In the 1920s, Gray even defended labor unions, having Annie launch a successful one-girl strike against a boss who mistreats her. Gray&#x27;s political opinions would take on a more partisan salience in the 1930s when the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt polarized American politics into those who saw the New Deal as the salvation for the working class and those who saw it as the end of American liberty. Gray fell into the anti-FDR camp and Annie became much more explicitly right-wing ... There might be aspects of Gray&#x27;s life that didn&#x27;t make it into his strip. There are rumors that he was a skirt-chaser, and that&#x27;s something that doesn&#x27;t show up much in &quot;Annie&quot;, although you can catch hints of it here and there ... Newspaper cartooning is like keeping a daily diary: even if you&#x27;re writing only about the weather and shopping, bits of your personality will seep into the work. In Gray&#x27;s case, the strip reflected his flinty world view, his love of hard work, his populist spirit, and also his fear of those he thought were undermining society by their laziness and meanness. You get a very strong sense of the man in his work, which is one reason it&#x27;s one of the major comic strips ... Sidney Smith (creator of &quot;The Gumps&quot;) was a giant of his day whose place in history has largely been forgotten. Throughout the 1920s and later, &quot;The Gumps&quot; was one of the top strips in America, loved by millions. What set &quot;The Gumps&quot; apart from earlier strips was that, although it had a comic element, Smith also often embraced wholehearted melodrama. It was the first real soap opera strip, with the fate of characters unfolding in month-long narratives ... It&#x27;s an interesting question why Gray&#x27;s work continues to be remembered and indeed loved while Smith has been forgotten. I suspect the answer to the question has something to do with Gray&#x27;s skill at characterization. Like Charles Dickens, Gray had a natural gift for creating characters that are vivid and lifelike. Annie and Warbucks are the best example of this: both of them are so strong and forceful and memorable. Once you read their adventures, it&#x27;s hard to forget them as people.

Gray sometimes ghosted &quot;Little Joe&quot; (1933–1972), the strip by his assistant (and cousin) Ed Leffingwell which was continued by Ed&#x27;s brother Robert. &quot;Maw Green&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Annie&quot;, was published as a topper to &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;. It mixed vaudeville timing with the same deeply conservative attitudes as &quot;Annie&quot;.

Films, radio and merchandising made Gray a multi-millionaire. He died of cancer at the Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla on May 9, 1968, at the age of 74.

==Archives==
Harold Gray&#x27;s work is in the Special Collections Department at the Boston University Library. The Gray collection includes artwork, printed material, correspondence, manuscripts and photographs. The collection contains a scrapbook, a short story by Gray titled &quot;Annie&quot;, letters, postcards and telegrams from 1937 to 1967, including correspondence with &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, Purdue University, Al Capp and Mort Walker. Gray&#x27;s appointment books with comic strip dialogue and plots are dated 1929, 1931, 1933–1935, 1937, 1944, 1946, 1949, 1950–1959 and 1961. Photographs show Gray drawing and Gray as a U.S. Army officer.

<doc id="1263346" wikidata="Q2891409" url="?curid=1263346" title="Atlantic Avenue (New York City)">
<text>Atlantic Avenue is a major thoroughfare in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. It stretches from the Brooklyn waterfront on the East River all the way to Jamaica, Queens. Atlantic Avenue runs parallel to Fulton Street for much of its course through Brooklyn, where it serves as a border between the neighborhoods of Prospect Heights and Fort Greene and between Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights, and between Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill. This stretch of avenue is known for having a high rate of pedestrian fatalities and has been described as &quot;the killing fields of the city.&quot;

Atlantic Avenue is the sole east–west through truck route across Brooklyn, mostly serving the purpose of the canceled Bushwick Expressway (Interstate 78) and the Brooklyn portion of the Cross Brooklyn Expressway (New York State Route 878, internally known as Interstate 878). The street connects to the existing segment of NY 878 via Conduit Boulevard, which splits from Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn and connects to NY 878 in Queens.

==Route description==
In Brooklyn, the area of Atlantic nearest the South Ferry waterfront has long been known for its antique shops and its notable Arab community, including mosques, specialty shops and restaurants specializing in Middle Eastern cuisine. As it stretches east toward Flatbush Avenue, Atlantic separates the neighborhoods of Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill and passes through Boerum Hill near Downtown Brooklyn. This section of Atlantic Avenue is the site of the Atlantic Antic, an annual street fair involving local and visiting merchants and artists, held in early October.

At Flatbush Avenue and Fourth Avenue the crossing of the three major thoroughfares form a triangular intersection historically known as Times Plaza. Here the smaller shops, restaurants, churches and boutiques give way to the Atlantic Terminal, where subway services at the Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center station converge with the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). The area is dominated by massive buildings, formerly factories, now used by storage companies, and by the Atlantic Center Mall (opened in 1996, with tenants including P.C. Richard &amp; Son and Modell&#x27;s), Atlantic Terminal Mall (opened in 2004, with tenants including Target) and Barclays Center. All three are products of developer Forest City Ratner.

The face of Atlantic Avenue east of Flatbush Avenue, the site designated for the Brooklyn Atlantic Yards, is defined by the LIRR tracks that run beneath (from Flatbush Avenue to Bedford Avenue), above (from Bedford Avenue to Dewey Place), and beneath again in East New York until Lefferts Boulevard in Queens.

The Atlantic Avenue Railroad (now LIRR) originally ran along Atlantic Avenue as streetcars pulled by horses. With electrification, other traffic was eliminated from the roadway and Atlantic Avenue became discontinuous. When railway sections west of Jamaica station were put underground in the early 1940s, that portion of Atlantic Avenue became continuous again. Northeast of Bedford Avenue, the railway is still at (or above) ground level.

Just east of the Van Wyck Expressway, the roadway narrows to one lane and carries eastbound traffic only to 95th Avenue (westbound traffic diverges to 94th Avenue past this point). The one-block section between the Van Wyck Expressway and 95th Avenue opened in July 2020 as part of the $17 million Gateway Park project. Atlantic Avenue from the Brooklyn Docks to Gateway Park at Van Wyck Expressway is 10.3 miles long, with 7.4 miles in Brooklyn, making it one of Brooklyn&#x27;s longest streets.

Pre-electrification maps from 1909 and 1910 show Atlantic Avenue, at that time, continued to the city line.

===Other iterations of this road===
Short roadways still named Atlantic Avenue exist further east adjacent to the LIRR Main Line within Nassau County.
A stretch of road still named Atlantic Avenue, just under one mile long, runs just south of the Main Line from the Bellerose station to the Floral Park station.

Just north of the Merillon Avenue train station in Garden City is another short roadway called Atlantic Avenue. Other short segments of roadway called Atlantic Avenue exist adjacent to the Main Line at Carle Place in Nassau County, and even as far east as the approach to the Nassau-Suffolk County line, just beyond the Farmingdale LIRR station.

===Similarly named roads in New York===
There is a four-block-long Atlantic Avenue in Sea Gate, Brooklyn.

==Transportation==
Atlantic Avenue is served by the following:
* The New York City Bus route runs on Atlantic Avenue between Van Wyck Expressway and Pennsylvania Avenue.

<doc id="1263357" wikidata="Q2298285" url="?curid=1263357" title="Didot family">
<text>Didot is the name of a family of French printers, punch-cutters and publishers. Through its achievements and advancements in printing, publishing and typography, the family has lent its name to typographic measurements developed by François-Ambroise Didot and the Didot typeface developed by Firmin Didot. The Didot company of France was ultimately incorporated into the modern CPI printing group.

The Didot family played a significant role in the development of printing over several generations, beginning in the early 18th century in France. François Didot, the progenitor, was a Parisian merchant who founded a bookstore in 1713 and received a printer&#x27;s charter in 1754, publishing notable works like the &quot;Histoire des voyages.&quot; His son, François-Ambroise Didot, succeeded him and made significant contributions to printing technology, including the invention of the Didot point system, a method for sizing typefaces that became standard in Europe.

The family&#x27;s contributions to the industry continued with Pierre-François Didot, who established a paper factory and made advances in type-founding. The third generation included Pierre Didot and Firmin Didot; Pierre focused on producing sophisticated, collectible books with contributions from contemporary artists, while Firmin pioneered stereotypography and was recognized for his work in type design, contributing to the &quot;Modern&quot; classification of typefaces.

Subsequent generations of the family furthered their legacy. Jules Didot expanded the printing business to Brussels, founding the Royal Printing House, and Ambroise-Firmin Didot took over the family business with his brother, publishing significant works like a new edition of the &quot;Thesaurus Graecae Linguae.&quot; The Didots were involved in papermaking and the invention of machinery to improve the printing process.

==First generation==
===François Didot===
François Didot (son of Denis Didot) was a merchant who was born in Paris in 1689 and died in 1757. In 1713 he opened a bookstore called &quot;À la Bible d&#x27;or&quot; (which could be translated &quot;The Golden Bible&quot;) on the Quai des Grands-Augustins. The celebrated Abbé de Bernis served for a time there as a clerk after leaving the seminary. François Didot was a learned man, and held by his colleagues in such great esteem that he was elected to the dignity of Syndic of the Booksellers&#x27; Corporation in 1735. He received his printer&#x27;s charter from the king in 1754. Among the books he published should be mentioned the &quot;Histoire des voyages&quot; (&quot;Story of Voyages/Travels&quot;) (20 vols., quarto), the first seventeen volumes of which are attributed to the Abbé Prévost. It was remarkable for its typographical perfection, and was adorned with many engravings and maps.

==Second generation==
===François-Ambroise Didot===
François-Ambroise Didot (son of François Didot) was born in 1730 and died in 1804. François-Ambroise Didot inherited the work of his father François. He was appointed printer to the clergy in 1788. Many bibliophiles value the editions known as &quot;D&#x27;Artois&quot; (&quot;Collection d&#x27;ouvrages français&quot;, 64 volumes, 1780-84) and &quot;du Dauphin&quot;, a collection of French classics in 32 volumes, edited by order of Louis XVI. He also published a Bible. François-Ambroise Didot invented a new printing-press, improved type-founding, and was the first to print on vellum paper.

About 1780 François-Ambroise Didot adapted the point system for sizing typefaces by width, using units of 1/72 of the pre-metric French inch. His &quot;point&quot;, later named the &quot;didot&quot; after him, became the prevailing unit of type measurement throughout continental Europe and its former colonies, including Latin America. In 1973 it was metrically standardized at 0.375 mm for the European Union. (Meanwhile, the English-speaking world adopted a &quot;point&quot; based on 1/72 of the smaller English inch.)

===Pierre-François Didot===

Pierre-François Didot (son of François Didot) was born in 1732 and died in 1795. Pierre-François Didot founded a paper factory in Essonne and made improvements in type-founding. The most important of his publications are &quot;L&#x27;Imitation de Jésus-Christ&quot; (folio), &quot;Télémaque&quot; (quarto) and &quot;Tableau de L&#x27;Empire Ottoman&quot; (folio). One of his daughters married Bernardin de Saint-Pierre.

==Third generation==
===Pierre Didot===
Pierre Didot (son of François-Ambroise Didot) was born in 1760 and died in 1853. Pierre Didot and his brother Firmin inherited their father&#x27;s business in 1798. Pierre started to shift the focus of the press to sophisticated, collectible books. Big books with large margins, exquisite artwork, and exquisite typesetting were all designed by Pierre. In addition, the books frequently had opulent bindings. Pierre hired modern painters to illustrate his works which he then printed the words in a new typeface that his brother had created especially for it. To edit the images, Didot enlisted the services of artist Jacques Louis David. Of his work &quot;Virgil&quot;, David created five of the images. Pierre Didot was also a poet and translated in verse the fourth book of Georgics, the first books of Horace&#x27;s Odes, and wrote a number of original poems. Pierre Didot was awarded a gold medal at the exhibition of 1798, for his edition of &quot;Virgil&quot;. By order of the Government, his presses were established in the Louvre, where they remained during the Consulate. The celebrated Louvre editions are &quot;Virgil&quot; (1798), &quot;Horace&quot; (1799), &quot;Racine&quot; (1801–5), &quot;La Fontaine&quot; (1802), and &quot;Boileau&quot; (1816). 

===Firmin Didot===
Firmin Didot (son of François-Ambroise Didot) was born in 1764 and died in 1836. Firmin Didot was a pioneer of stereotypography which entirely changed the book trade. Firmin Didot was the first to engrave slips of so-called &quot;English&quot; and round hand-writing. Among the works which issued from his press were &quot;Les Ruines de Pompéi&quot;, &quot;Le Panthéon égyptien&quot; of Champollion-Figeac, and &quot;Historial du Jongleur&quot;, printed in Gothic type, with tail-pieces and vignettes, like the editions of the fifteenth century. In 1827, Firmin Didot gave up business to devote himself to politics and literature. He was a member of the Chamber of Deputies and wrote tragedies (&quot;La Reine de Portugal&quot;, &quot;La Mort d&#x27;Annibal&quot;) and essays on literary topics.

Along with Giambattista Bodoni of Italy, Firmin Didot is credited with designing and establishing the use of the &quot;Modern&quot; classification of typefaces. The types that Didot used are characterized by extreme contrast in thick strokes and thin strokes, by the use of hairline serifs and by the vertical stress of the letters. Many fonts today are available based on Firmin Didot&#x27;s typefaces. These include Linotype Didot and HTF Didot .

===Henri Didot===
Henri Didot (son of Pierre-François Didot) was born in 1765 and died in 1852. Henri Didot made a name for himself as an engraver, founder, and engine-maker. In 1827, he engraved the microscopic type called &#x27;Non Plus Ultra&#x27; that was used for the editions of the &quot;Maximes&quot; of La Rochefoucauld and Horace&#x27;s works. This type was so small that, to cast it, he had to invent a new mould which he called polyamatype (1819), because it founded one hundred letters at a time. Henri Didot engraved the assignats, the paper money used during the French Revolution.

===Saint-Léger Didot===
Saint-Léger Didot (son of Pierre-François Didot) was born in 1767 and died in 1829. Saint-Léger Didot devoted his attention to papermaking in the famous factory of Essonne, where one of his workers, Louis-Nicolas Robert invented a machine to make &quot;endless&quot; paper, and eventually sold the patent to Didot.

==Fourth generation==
===Jules Didot===
Jules Didot (son of Pierre Didot) was born in 1794 and died in 1871. Jules Didot is famous for his invention of round-edged initials, to take the place of the sharp-edged ones. In 1825 he took his printing plant to Brussels and founded the Royal Printing House.

===Ambroise-Firmin Didot===
Ambroise-Firmin Didot (son of Firmin Didot) was born 1790 and died in 1876. Ambroise-Firmin Didot first followed a diplomatic career and was for a time attache of the French Embassy at Constantinople. He took advantage of his position to visit the East and Greece, being the first to discover the location of Pergamacum. When his father retired in 1827, he, together with his brother Hyacinthe, took the management of the publishing business. They published the three book series Bibliothèque des auteurs grecs (Scriptorum graecorum bibliotheca), Collection des auteurs latins, and Bibliothèque des auteurs français, which comprised 200 volumes in all. Their greatest work was a new edition of the &quot;Thesaurus Graecae Linguae&quot;, of Henry Stephens, edited by Jean François Boissonade de Fontarabie, Dindorf, and Hase (9 vols., 1855–59).

Ambroise-Firmin Didot was also involved with the 4th edition of &quot;L&#x27;Encyclopedie Moderne&quot;, 30 vols in total, published in the years 1846–1861. A part was also published as: &quot;Essay sur la Typographie, Extrait du Tome XXVI de l&#x27;Encyclopédie moderne, Typographie de Firmin Didot Frères, Imprimereurs de l&#x27;Institut de France, Paris, Rue Jacob 56, 1851&quot; 

===Edouard Didot===
Edouard Didot (son of Saint-Léger Didot) was born in 1797 and died in 1825. Edouard Didot made a translation of Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;, which was printed by Jules Didot.

<doc id="1263364" wikidata="Q1158567" url="?curid=1263364" title="Damián Álvarez (footballer, born 1979)">
<text>Damián Ariel Álvarez (born 21 May 1979), also known as &quot;La Chilindrina&quot;, is a former professional footballer who played as a winger. Born in Argentina, he played for the Mexico national team.

==Club career==
Álvarez made his professional debut in Argentina for River Plate in 1998. In 2002, he moved to Serie B to play for Reggina. However, he returned to the Americas a year later, joining Morelia of the Liga MX. Álvarez played a significant role for the team that season, playing in 16 games, 13 starts, and scoring three goals and helped them reach the league final but lost to Monterrey. He remained a consistent starter for the team and started a total of 60 games for the team, scoring nine goals.

He moved to Pachuca, earning six championships with the team: one Copa Sudamericana, three CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, one SuperLiga, and the Mexican Clausura 2007. Álvarez has been a significant member in every championship.

===Tigres UANL===
In the 2010 draft of the Liga MX, Álvarez was bought by Tigres UANL in a high-profile transfer. A starter under Ricardo Ferretti, he became a key in the team&#x27;s offensive for the Apertura 2011 Championship. He scored the goal of the 1–0 victory in the first leg of the finals against Santos Laguna. Tigres won the Liga MX Championship for the third time after 29 years. Álvarez, along with Danilinho, Héctor Mancilla and Lucas Lobos in the attack, became the so-called &quot;Cuatro Fantásticos&quot; (&quot;Fantastic Four&quot;) of the Liga MX.

On December 14, 2014, he received a red card along with teammates Hernán Burbano and Nahuel Guzmán in the Apertura 2014 final against Club América. Álvarez and his team lost 3–0 in the final at the Estadio Azteca. 
Álvarez was a regular starter in the 2015 Copa Libertadores. In the group stage, Tigres played against his former team River Plate and scored the second goal of the 2–2 draw in the home game. Tigres would eventually reached to the finals and lose to River Plate.

Álvarez played an important role in the playoffs of the Apertura 2015 Championship. Damián, who in the regular season played a substitute role, scored one goal in quarterfinals against Chiapas and one more in semifinals against Toluca. Tigres became champions defeating Pumas UNAM.

He came in as substitute of Javier Aquino in the second half of the Apertura 2016 finals against Club América. Álvarez started the play that dramatically tied the game in overtime, by crossing to Jürgen Damm, who then re-crossed to Jesús Dueñas, that finally scored a header at the 119&#x27;. Tigres beat América in penalty shoot-out.

With very few minutes in the Apertura 2017 season, a 38-year old Álvarez officially retired from his playing career after Tigres beat archrival CF Monterrey in the first and only League final between the two. After his retirement, Álvarez became an instant idol among fans, and is considered, along with names such as Tomás Boy, Gerónimo Barbadillo, Claudio Núñez, Walter Gaitán and Lucas Lobos, as one of the most emblematic players of Tigres.

==International career==
In 2012, Álvarez became a naturalized Mexican citizen, having settled in Mexico in 2003. He was called up to Mexico national team on 23 February for a friendly against Colombia; Mexico lost 2–0.

<doc id="1263365" wikidata="Q415602" url="?curid=1263365" title="Acetylide">
<text>In chemistry, an acetylide is a compound that can be viewed as the result of replacing one or both hydrogen atoms of acetylene (ethyne) by metallic or other cations. Calcium carbide is an important industrial compound, which has long been used to produce acetylene for welding and illumination. It is also a major precursor to vinyl chloride. Other acetylides are reagents in organic synthesis.

==Nomenclature==
The term acetylide is used loosely. It apply to an acetylene , where R = H or a side chain that is usually organic. The nomenclature can be ambiguous with regards to the distinction between compounds of the type and . When both hydrogens of acetylene are replaced by metals, the compound can also be called carbide, e.g. calcium carbide , which is calcium acetylide. When only one hydrogen atom is replaced, the anion may be called hydrogen acetylide or the prefix &quot;mono&quot;- may be attached to the metal, as in monosodium acetylide or sodium hydrogen acetylide, . An acetylide may be a salt (ionic compound) containing the anion , , or , as in disodium acetylide or cobalt(II) acetylide . Other acetylides have the metal bound to the carbon atom(s) by covalent bonds, being therefore coordination or organometallic compounds.

===Ionic acetylides===
Alkali metal and alkaline earth metal acetylides of the general formula and are salt-like Zintl phase compounds, containing ions, with a triple bond between the two carbon atoms. Evidence for this ionic character can be seen in the ready hydrolysis of these compounds to form acetylene and metal oxides, and by solubility in liquid ammonia with solvated ions.

The ion has a closed shell ground state of 1Σ, making it isoelectronic to a neutral molecule , which may afford it some gas-phase stability.

===Organometallic acetylides===
Some acetylides, particularly of transition metals, show evidences of covalent character, e. g. for being neither dissolved nor decomposed by water and by radically different chemical reactions. That seems to be the case of silver acetylide and copper acetylide, for example.

In the absence of additional ligands, metal acetylides adopt polymeric structures wherein the acetylide groups are bridging ligands.

==Preparation==
===Of the type ===
Acetylene and terminal alkynes are weak acids:

Monopotassium and monosodium acetylide can be prepared by reacting acetylene with bases like sodium amide or with the elemental metals, often at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
Copper(I) acetylide can be prepared by passing acetylene through an aqueous solution of copper(I) chloride because of a low solubility equilibrium. Similarly, silver acetylides can be obtained from silver nitrate.

In organic synthesis, acetylides are usually prepared by treating acetylene and alkynes with organometallic or inorganic Classically, liquid ammonia was used for deprotonations, but ethers are now more commonly used.

Lithium amide, LiHMDS, or organolithium reagents, such as butyllithium (), are frequently used to form lithium acetylides:

===Of the type and ===
Calcium carbide is prepared industrially by heating carbon with lime (calcium oxide) at approximately 2,000 °C. A similar process can be used to produce lithium carbide.

Dilithium acetylide, , competes with the preparation of the monolithium derivative .

==Reactions==
Ionic acetylides are typically decomposed by water with evolution of acetylene:


Acetylides of the type are widely used in alkynylations in organic chemistry. They are nucleophiles that add to a variety of electrophilic and unsaturated substrates. 

A classic application is the Favorskii reaction, such as in the sequence shown below. Here ethyl propiolate is deprotonated by &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium to give the corresponding lithium acetylide. This acetylide adds to the carbonyl center of cyclopentanone. Hydrolysis liberates the alkynyl alcohol.

The dimerization of acetylene to vinylacetylene proceeds by insertion of acetylene into a copper(I) acetylide complex.

===Coupling reactions===
Acetylides are sometimes used as intermediates in coupling reactions. Examples include Sonogashira coupling, Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling, Glaser coupling and Eglinton coupling.

==Hazards==
Some acetylides are notoriously explosive. Formation of acetylides poses a risk in handling of gaseous acetylene in presence of metals such as mercury, silver or copper, or alloys with their high content (brass, bronze, silver solder).

<text>Battle of Yashima (屋島の戦い) was one of the battles of the Genpei War on March 22, 1185, in the Heian period. It occurred in Sanuki Province (Shikoku), which is now Takamatsu, Kagawa.

==Background==
Following a long string of defeats, the Taira clan retreated to Yashima, today&#x27;s Takamatsu, just off the coast of Shikoku. Here they had a fortress, and an improvised palace for Emperor Antoku and the imperial regalia, which they had taken earlier in the war.

== Battle ==
On the 18th, a Minamoto force tried to cross the sea but many of the boats were damaged in a storm. Kajiwara Kagetoki then suggested adding &quot;reverse oars&quot; to the boats, which prompted an argument from Minamoto no Yoshitsune. Finally after the boats were repaired and despite the high winds, Yoshitsune departed with only five of the 200 boats carrying about 150 of his men. After arriving in Tsubaki Bay, in Awa Province. Yoshitsune then advanced into Sanuki Province through the night reaching the bay with the Imperial Palace at Yashima, and the houses in Mure and Takamatsu.

The Taira were expecting a naval attack, and so Yoshitsune lit bonfires on Shikoku, essentially in their rear, fooling the Taira into believing that a large force was approaching on land. They abandoned their palace, and took to their ships, along with Emperor Antoku and the imperial regalia.

In a memorable account in the &quot;Heike monogatari&quot;, a &quot;very beautiful lady&quot; in a Heike boat, placed a fan atop a pole, and dared the Minamoto to knock it off. In one of the most famous archery feats in all of Japanese history, Nasu no Yoichi rode out into the sea on horseback, and did just that in one shot. The Minamoto were victorious, but the majority of the Taira fleet escaped to Dan-no-ura, where they were defeated one month later in the Battle of Dan-no-ura.

==Plot==
Jota, a failed musician whose girlfriend has recently left him, is about to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge when a girl on a motorcycle, Sofía, crashes off it. Rushing to help her, he discovers she has lost her memory and cannot even remember her name. After telling the paramedics and staff at the hospital that she is his girlfriend, he later tells her the same. He invents an entire identity for her, giving her the name Lisa, and a history of their relationship according to his own fantasies. With the hospital psychiatrist starting to become suspicious, he spirits her out of the hospital and away on a trip to the Ardilla Roja campsite, which he claims they have been planning for some while. As their relationship becomes intimate, their behaviour sparks the suspicions of campers Antón and Carmena.

<doc id="1263373" wikidata="Q1196211" url="?curid=1263373" title="Gamebryo">
<text>Gamebryo (; ; formerly NetImmerse until 2003) is a game engine developed by Gamebase Co., Ltd. and Gamebase USA, that incorporates a set of tools and plugins including run-time libraries, supporting video game developers for numerous cross-platform game titles in a variety of genres, and served as a basis for the Creation Engine.

== History ==
Numerical Design Limited (NDL) was founded in 1983, mostly doing contract work for government and CAD clients in the computer graphics sector, though also some game developers such as Interactive Magic. This work led to the production of the NetImmerse game engine in 1997, evolving into Gamebryo by 2003.

NDL was merged into Emergent Game Technologies (EGT, founded 2000, Butterfly.net until May 2005) in August 2005. NetImmerse then evolved to Gamebryo LightSpeed. During 2009 the development staff of Gamebryo was downsized, and by July 2010 the engineering office in Chapel Hill, North Carolina was closed. On November 11, 2010, assets of EGT were offered for acquisition, including its intellectual Property (IP), in whole or in part.

In December 2010, Korea-based Gamebase Co., Ltd., a longtime partner of EGT, finalized the acquisition of EGT assets and technology, and established a newly capitalized U.S. company, Gamebase USA. Gamebase USA is based in the Research Triangle Park region of North Carolina and is focused on continual development of the Gamebryo game engine. The newest version, Gamebryo 4.0, was introduced in March 2012.

== Features ==
The Gamebryo system is a suite of modular C++ libraries. Game developers can combine and extend the libraries to modify the engine for a particular game. Gamebryo&#x27;s design emphasises a rapid prototyping approach aimed at an iterative development process.

The Gamebryo engine supports several deployment platforms including Microsoft Windows (DirectX 6–11), Mac, iOS, Android, Linux (OpenGL), GameCube, Wii, PlayStation, PS2, PSP, PS3, PS4, Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.

Gamebryo 4.0 is the latest version of the engine, designed to merge the original Gamebryo system with its LightSpeed spin-off.

== Games ==
Gamebryo is used by numerous companies within the gaming industry. Below is a sample of titles that have used the engine:

<doc id="1263376" wikidata="Q1430058" url="?curid=1263376" title="Florida Seals">
<text>The Florida Seals were a minor league ice hockey franchise, a member of the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL). Originally based in Orlando, Florida, as the Orlando Seals, they later moved to Kissimmee, Florida, a suburb thirty miles south of Orlando in Osceola County. The Seals were one of eight minor league hockey teams purchased or founded by David Waronker starting in 2003.

==History==
The team was formed as the Orlando Seals and played its first season beginning in October 2002 with the Atlantic Coast Hockey League (ACHL). That first year&#x27;s team included former NHL players Zac Boyer, David Goverde, Chris LiPuma, and Terry Ryan. It was coached by former Tampa Bay Lightning player Stan Drulia. The Seals were running away with the league during the regular season and made a pivotal move at the trade deadline getting high scoring center Mike Sanderson and defenseman Dave Mills. These moves at the trade deadline gave the Seals the final pieces to win the ACHL regular season. The Seals&#x27; original staff was made up of owner Jeff Brubaker until he ran out of money one month into the season and David Waronker took over the franchise. Other staff members brought in were GM Sammy Wallace, Joe Fellini, John Dyer, Erika Hodges, and Tom Bradley. With the backing of several Solar Bears&#x27; season ticket holders, the Seals got off to a solid start attendance-wise and later on the ice thanks to a solid core of hockey fans in Orlando and a roster full of veteran players. With Waronker&#x27;s investment, the staff was able to make the team a success. The Seals were the winners of that league&#x27;s first and only President&#x27;s Cup in 2003 as well as the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup as regular season champions after a 43–14 record. League Commissioner Jim Riggs awarded the trophy to the Waronker and Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer during an on-ice ceremony at one of the regular season games. The Seals swept both Macon Trax and Knoxville in the playoffs to win the championship on the road in Knoxville.

The team&#x27;s celebration event, held at Wall Street Plaza in downtown Orlando, drew hundreds of fans to celebrate the city&#x27;s second hockey championship. When the ACHL folded, they and two other teams, the Jacksonville Barracudas and the Macon Trax, merged into the new World Hockey Association 2 (WHA2), founded by Waronker and longtime Canadian hockey man and former WHA staffer Peter Young. The second season brought a coaching change as Stan Drulia left Orlando to take over the coaching duties of the Augusta Lynx of the ECHL. Former Pittsburgh Penguin Jim Paek was brought in to lead the Seals in year two. 

After the 2003–04 season, the team went through several coaching and staff change including Paek being replaced by former Macon Trax head coach Tommy Stewart when the Trax ceased operations. The Seals were also announced to join the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL) for the 2004–05 season.

On August 22, 2004, the City of Orlando revoked its lease at the TD Waterhouse Centre due to a clause about attendance and the Seals would miss the season. On October 19, 2004, the ownership group announced a new three-year lease with the Silver Spurs Arena in Kissimmee, changing its name to the Florida Seals. The team resumed play in the 2005–06 season, hosting their first home game against the Jacksonville Barracudas on October 29, 2005. The Seals finished the 2005–06 season with a 32–17 record with seven overtime losses, placing third in the league, but lost the President&#x27;s Cup to the Knoxville Ice Bears in five games.

Before the 2006–07 season, Waronker agreed in principle to sell the team to real estate developer Bill Lucia. However, while the deal closed in May 2006, Lucia did not file the required league paperwork until October and never made a formal presentation to the league. Later in the month, the team&#x27;s general manager resigned. On January 4, 2007, Osceola Heritage Park, operators of the Silver Spurs Arena, abruptly locked out the Seals after they failed to meet their contractual obligations. OHP facility director Robb Larson said that OHP had run out of patience with the Seals after giving them numerous chances to get back in compliance. Stewart told WFTV that the team was short on cash and had missed several payments on its lease with the arena. At the same time, the players had been kicked out of their apartments because the team was not paying the rent.

The next day, the SPHL Board of Directors held an emergency meeting and voted to expel the Seals from the league. The players were parceled out to the other SPHL teams in a dispersal draft.

Lucia later revealed that, for all intents and purposes, the rest of the board had essentially abandoned the team; he had been the only one paying the bills.

Several members of the Seals&#x27; organization continued their careers in professional sports with Sammy Wallace working for the Germain Arena in Estero, Florida, and Peter Young was with a baseball team in Arizona. Joe Fellini became the director of sales at the Tsongas Center at University of Massachusetts Lowell in Massachusetts, while Brian Fling moved to Colorado to work in the private sector. Ryan Morris was working in the music field with Rymo Records. Erika Hodges went on to work for the Florida Panthers, and Tom Bradley earned a Stanley Cup ring with the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Seals first two coaches were still active with Drulia working with the Milwaukee Admirals and Paek with the Grand Rapids Griffins.

==Championships==
The mascot of the Florida Seals was Sealvester. He wore a jersey emblazoned with the number &quot;05&quot;.

<text>Juraj (Giorgio) Dobrila (16 April 1812 – 13 January 1882) was a Croatian Catholic bishop and benefactor from Istria who advocated for greater national rights for South Slavic peoples, Croats and Slovenes, in Istria under Austrian rule.

==Biography==
Dobrila was born in the village of Veli Ježenj (now part of Pazin), Tinjan (Antignana) region of middle Istria, which was then and for a brief period part of Napoleon&#x27;s Illyrian provinces and shortly thereafter the Habsburg monarchy (today part of Croatia). His above-average intelligence let him engage a German elementary school in Tinjan and Pazin, then a gymnasium in Gorizia, and Karlovac where he also attended a seminary. He became a priest in 1837 and took duty from 1837 until late 1838 in Mune and Hrusici. From 1839 he studied theology at Augustineum in Vienna and finished in 1842. After his studies, he became a chaplain in Trieste, a German enlighter and a principal of a girl-school. From 1857 to 1875 he was the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Parenzo e Pola - Poreč i Pula region and from 1875 until his death he was the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trieste e Capodistria - Trst in Koper region.

Dobrila studied with and was a friend of Josip Juraj Strossmayer, another Croatian bishop and benefactor of the 19th century. He was a vocal supporter of the Croat and Slovene population in Istria, which was the majority there, but culturally and politically dominated by Italians from the coastal towns.

During the Revolutions of 1848, Dobrila became a member of the &quot;Slavjansko društvo&quot; (&quot;Slavic society&quot;) in Trieste. He supported the introduction of the Slavic languages into schools and public life, funded children who wanted to attend schools in the Croatian part of the monarchy (in Rijeka and Kastav) and encouraged the peasants in Istria, mostly composed of Slavic people, to read books in their native language and avoid being abused by their mostly Italian lords.

Dobrila printed the prayer book &quot;Oče, budi volja tvoja&quot; in Croatian in 1854, and supported the publishing of the first Croatian newspaper in Istria &quot;Naša sloga&quot; in 1870. He also published a collection of folk tales and proverbs &quot;Različno cvijeće&quot;. His second prayer book &quot;Mladi Bogoljub&quot; was published in 1889.
He was a member of the Diet of Istria in Poreč since its founding in 1861 and the representative of the council in the Parliament in Vienna until 1867. He was also a participant of the First Vatican Council (1870) where he supported Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer&#x27;s opposition to the doctrine of papal infallibility.

Dobrila donated his whole estate to charity. Dobrila&#x27;s portrait was depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 10 kuna banknote issued in 1993, 1995, 2001 and 2004. Two high schools are named after Dobrila, one in Pazin and one in Pula.
The University of Pula is named in his honour Juraj Dobrila University of Pula.

<doc id="1263387" wikidata="Q903291" url="?curid=1263387" title="Parafilm">
<text>Parafilm is a semi-transparent, flexible film composed of a blend of waxes and polyolefins.
It is a ductile, malleable, non-toxic, edible, tasteless, odorless, and self-sealing thermoplastic.
It has been manufactured by the company Amcor since its acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc in 2018. It comes in two colors, natural (colorless) and purple.

==Laboratories==
Parafilm M is commonly used in health care, pharmaceutical and research laboratories for covering or sealing vessels such as flasks, cuvettes, test tubes, beakers, petri dishes and more.
The &quot;M&quot; stands for mounting or maps, as Parafilm was originally used to mount charts and other objects using heat. Parafilm M was marketed in 1950s for lab use and for various home applications.

Because it melts quickly when heated, Parafilm M is not safe for use in an autoclave. It is also soluble in many organic solvents.

==Other applications==
=== Produce ===
Some growers use Parafilm M instead of fungicides or other coatings to prevent rot, wrapping it around the freshly cut crowns of bananas, pineapples and other produce.

=== Stem wrap ===
Florists use Parafilm Stem Wrap to extend the flower&#x27;s life by protecting moisture in the stem as a floral tape.

=== Grafting ===
Horticulturalists use Parafilm Grafting Tape in grafting. Several grafting styles call for wrapping a graft to hold it together, and sealing it to prevent drying and Parafilm Grafting Tape does both. In this context Parafilm is also known as grafting tape.

===Modeling===
Parafilm M is used by some modelers as a masking material during airbrushing, due to its lack of adhesion, which can destroy a finish.

===Entomology===
Entomologists have used Parafilm M as a membrane to feed hematophagous insects such as mosquitoes and bedbugs reared in the lab.

===Microfluidics===
An application of Parafilm M is to make paper-based microfluidic devices. Paper-based microfluidic devices are considered a suitable way to fabricate low-cost point-of-care diagnostics for developing countries and areas where expensive medical instrumentation is not accessible.
Digital microfluidic devices can also use it as the electrode insulator and hydrophobic layer

<doc id="1263391" wikidata="Q1516783" url="?curid=1263391" title="History of European Jews in the Middle Ages">
<text>History of European Jews in the Middle Ages covers Jewish history in Europe in the period from the 5th to the 15th century. During the course of this period, the Jewish population experienced a gradual diaspora shifting from their motherland of the Levant to Europe. These Jewish individuals settled primarily in the regions of Central Europe dominated by the Holy Roman Empire and Southern Europe dominated by various Iberian kingdoms. As with Christianity, the Middle Ages were a period in which Judaism became mostly overshadowed by Islam in the Middle East, and an increasingly influential part of the socio-cultural and intellectual landscape of Europe.

Jewish tradition traces the origins of the Jews to the 12 Israelite tribes. However, most Jewish traditions state that modern Jews descend from Judah, Benjamin and Levi. As early as the Babylonian exile Jews, through exile under military constraint or otherwise, came to live in many other Middle Eastern countries, and later formed communities throughout the eastern Mediterranean lands, constituting collectively a Jewish diaspora. Their presence is attested in Greece from the fourth century BCE onwards in places as varied as Chios, Aegina, Attica and Rhodes and in Italy as early as the 2nd century BCE.

The Jewish people that first called the city of Rome &quot;home&quot; came directly from the Holy Land. After the Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE), a few thousand Jews were taken as slaves to Rome, where they later immigrated to other European lands. The Jews who immigrated to Iberia, and their descendants comprise the Sephardic Jews, while those who immigrated to the German Rhineland and France comprise the Ashkenazi Jews. A significant depletion in their numbers in Western Europe began to take place with the rise of the Crusades, which brought about many pogroms and successive expulsion orders, in England (1290), France (14th century) and Spain (1492). With the end of the medieval age, a similar phenomenon was to repeat itself in the Italian peninsula and throughout most German towns and principalities in German-speaking lands in the sixteenth century. As a result, many Jews migrated to Eastern Europe, with large Yiddish speaking populations expanding over the next several centuries. By the 17th century a trickle back process began, with reverse migration back to central and western Europe, following pogroms in Ukraine (1648–1649).

==From the fall of Rome to the Late Middle Ages (500–1500)==
===Fall of Rome===
The majority of archaeological and epigraphical evidence of the Jews in Late Ancient Rome lies in funerary sites, making it difficult to uncover a historical picture of their daily lives or their interactions with outsiders. After the decline of the Roman Empire, the Visigoths controlled large portions of former Roman territory, including southwestern Gaul until 507, and much of the Iberian peninsula until 711. At the start, Jewish communities generally flourished under Visigothic rule in both Gaul and Spain.

===Visigoth Spain ===

In 506, Alaric II decreed that Jews were to be considered Roman citizens and were to live under Roman law. They were given freedom to practice their religion, although efforts to convert pagans and Christians to Judaism were to be curtailed. Alaric also decreed that the judicial autonomy of the Jewish communities was to be respected. After Sisebut took the Visigothic throne in 612, these privileges were revoked, and suppression of the Jewish religion became policy, resulting in attempted forced conversion. There was a brief respite in 640, when Chindasuinth usurped the throne and pursued a pro-Jewish policy. His son Recceswinth, to the contrary, denounced Jews as &quot;polluting the soil of Spain&quot; in 653, and enacted a new code meant to make it impossible for Jews to remain in Spain. These laws proved to be unpopular, and were resisted by both Jews and Christians alike. Despite these persecutions, Jews were able to help Muslim invaders capture Spain, ending Visigothic rule.

=== Activities ===
The first historical testimonies on the activities of the Jews show that most were engaged in agriculture, and a minority were engaged in trade, as well as in handicrafts. In the South, &quot;particularly in south Italy and Greece - the Jewish communities had almost a monopoly of dyeing and silk-weaving&quot;. Some were involved in qualified services such as interpreters, translators, and medical practitioners.

In the High Middle Ages, many European Jews were specialized as merchants, money-lenders or artisans, as they were largely excluded from crafts guilds and barred from owning land. In contrast, Julie L. Mell insists on the fact that much of the Jewish population was left at the lower end of the urban economic scale.

European Jews were involved in the intellectual and cultural spheres of medieval society : &quot;Jews contributed to medicine, astrology, mathematics as well as to the arts, literature and music.&quot;

Many Jewish women, in comparison to Gentile women, worked alongside their male counterparts. These Jewish women relied on Christian women as wet nurses and caretakers of their young, which brought about some concern from their male partners regarding if their offspring would be truly &quot;Jewish&quot; and not impacted by these intimate relationships with Christians. It was common for many regions of Medieval Europe to have communal ovens that Jewish and Christian women would use in tandem. There is evidence of written correspondence between Jewish males and rabbinical authorities discussing whether or not certain intimate interactions were in accordance with Jewish law; it seems that many of the conclusions were that it should be left to the discretion of the women.

===Germany===

Jewish migration from Roman Italy is considered the most likely source of the first Jews within German territory, but there are multiple theories present in the scholarship currently available. While the date of the first settlement of Jews in the regions which the Romans called Germania Superior, Germania Inferior, and Magna Germania is not known, the first authentic documents relating to a large and well-organized Jewish community in these regions date from 321 and refers to Cologne on the Rhine. These documents stated that Jews could be called to the Curia and owed taxes to Rome, and that Jewish religious leaders were exempt from curial service, signalling that a uniquely Jewish community, prosperous enough to be taxed, had existed in Cologne for some time. During the Carolingian period, Jews had a vital function as importers of goods from the East, and their laws and customs were generally tolerated, although they were not allowed to proselytize to Christians. It was during this peaceful time, that Jews from other communities emigrated to Francia in hopes of better treatment, notably members of the Persian House of Exilarchs, such as Isaac the Jew and Makhir of Narbonne came to Francia and with them, brought a large community of Persian Jews, who later assimilated to European customs. However, these peaceful relations would end with the beginning of the First Crusade and thousands of Jews in communities all along the Rhine were attacked and killed under the presumption that if they were going to attack enemies of the Christ in Jerusalem, they should attack &quot;Christ&#x27;s enemies&quot; around them in Germany, ushering in a lasting antisemitism that included pogroms, blood libel, and being blamed as the cause of catastrophes like the Black Death and the Mongol invasion of Europe. Despite those difficulties, German Jews continued to practice, refine, and evolve their religious and social customs, including the development of the Yiddish language and an identity as Ashkenazi Jews. They eventually established a uniquely Jewish occupation, working as Court Jews within the Holy Roman Empire.

===Church laws in the Early Middle Ages===
Conversions of Jews to Christianity, whether forced or voluntary, during the medieval period were an integral part of the life of Jewish communities in the medieval period. The pressures to convert, other than compulsory baptism to save one&#x27;s life, could be theological, economic and intellectual. Voluntary conversion by such renegades (&quot;meshummadim&quot;) was motivated by a number of facts: a change of belief could account for the conversion, as could the desire to marry a Christian or to escape from the restrictions on life as a Jew, or to regain a livelihood or home. Such conversions proved particularly devastating for the English and Spanish Jewish communities.

By the 10th century, most of Europe was under the rule of Christian monarchs who made Christianity the official religion of their realms. In the Roman or Byzantine Empire, Christianity had been the state church since the Edict of Thessalonica in 380 AD. A privileged niche for Jews in the new order nonetheless remained. The Church forbade Christians from charging interest to fellow Christians; based upon the scripture Deuteronomy 23:20-21. With Christians viewing the Jewish population as foreigners (and vice versa) the ability to loan money with interest became an essential part of the Economy and synonymous with the various Jewish populations throughout medieval Europe. While this status did not always lead to peaceful conditions for the Jewish people, they were the most compatible non-Christians for the position due to their shared devotion to the same Abrahamic God that the Christians worshiped. While many Jews rose to prominence in these times, Judaism was mostly practiced in private to avoid persecution. The descendants of the survivors of this period, the Ashkenazi Jews, still commemorate some of the more memorable tragedies of this period in their liturgy.

Their fate in each particular country depended on the changing political conditions. In Italy (see History of the Jews in Italy) they experienced difficult days during the wars waged by the Heruli, Rugii, Ostrogoths, and Lombards. The severe laws of the Roman emperors were, in general, more mildly administered than elsewhere; the Arian confession, of which the Germanic conquerors of Italy were adherents, was characterized by its tolerance.

In other parts of western Europe, Jews who wished to remain true to the faith of their fathers were protected by the Church itself from compulsory conversion. There was no change in this policy even later, when the Pope called for the support of the Carolingians in protecting his ideal kingdom with their temporal power. Charlemagne, moreover, was glad to use the Church for the purpose of welding together the loosely connected elements of his kingdom when he transformed part of the old Roman empire into a new Christian one, and united under the imperial crown all the German races at that time. Years after his death, in 843, his empire fell apart, and the rulers of Italy, France, and Germany were more attentive to the Church&#x27;s desires in the making of laws dealing with the Jews.

In the wake of a narrow military defeat over Muslim forces, Leo III of Constantinople decided his nation&#x27;s weakness lay in its heterogeneous population and began the forcible conversion of the Jews, as well as the New Christians. However, some were able to secretly continue their Jewish practices. In 1040, Rashi was born, and in the wake of the Norman conquest of England, Jews left Normandy to settle in London and other cities such as York, Norwich, Oxford, Bristol and Lincoln, where Pope Gregory VII prohibited Jews from holding offices in Christendom. Iban Iashufin, the King of the Almoravides, captured Granada and destroyed the Jewish community, as the survivors fled to Toledo. In 1095, Henry IV of Germany granted the Jews favorable conditions and issued a charter to the Jews and a decree against forced baptism. In 1171, after the birth of Rambam, Jews were accused of committing ritual murder and blood libel in the town of Blois. The adult Jews of the city were arrested and most were executed after refusing to convert. In 1210, a group of 300 French and English rabbis made aliyah and settled in Israel. During the Black Death, the clerics accused Jews of poisoning the wells of Europe to kill all the Christians.

===Sicut Judaeis===

Sicut Judaeis (the &quot;Constitution for the Jews&quot;) was the official position of the papacy regarding Jews throughout the Middle Ages and later. The first bull was issued in about 1120 by Calixtus II, intended to protect Jews who were suffering during the First Crusade, and was reaffirmed by many popes, even until the 15th century. The bull forbade, besides other things, Christians from forcing Jews to convert, or to harm them, or to take their property, or to disturb the celebration of their festivals, or to interfere with their cemeteries, on pain of excommunication. Although the Jews and Christians of Rome were organized into distinct communities, the boundaries of which were not only reinforced on a daily basis but were regularly performed on ceremonial occasions such as the papal &quot;adventus,&quot; Jews and Christians experienced unusually robust cultural and social interactions, especially as the Jews increasingly aligned themselves with the protective power of the papacy.

However, despite the Church official position expressed in the &quot;Sicut Judaeis&quot;, the Church felt free to impose other restrictions and disabilities on Jews not inconsistent with the bull. For example, the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 decreed that Jews be differentiated from others by their type of clothing or marking to avoid intercourse between Jews and Christians. Jews were sometimes required to wear a yellow badge or a pointed hat. Christian theologians began calling for the slavery of all Jews.

In 1229, King Henry III of England forced Jews to pay half the value of their property in taxes, following burning of the Talmud in Paris and the Tartars&#x27; capture of Jerusalem. During the Fatimid period, many Jewish officials served in the regime. King Henry III of England ordered Jewish worship in synagogue to be held quietly so that Christians passing by would not have to hear it, giving an order that Jews may not employ Christian nurses or maids, nor may any Jew prevent another from converting to Christianity. A few years later, French King Louis IX expelled the Jews from France, ending the Tosaphists period. Most Jews went to Germany and further east.

===Later immigration to Germany===
In 1267, the Vienna city council forced Jews to wear the Jewish hat, in addition to the yellow badge. Later in the century, a blood libel in Munich resulted in the deaths of 68 Jews, and an additional 180 Jews were burned alive at the synagogue, following another mob in Oberwesel, Germany. In 1290, owing to political pressure, English King Edward I expelled all Jews from England. They were only allowed to take what they could carry and most went to France, paying for their passage only to be robbed and cast overboard by the ship captains. Philip IV of France ordered all Jews expelled from France, with their property to be sold at public auction, and some 125,000 Jews were forced to leave. Similar to accusations made during the Black Plague, Jews were accused of encouraging lepers to poison Christian wells in France. An estimated five thousand Jews were killed before the king, Philip the Tall, admitted the Jews were innocent. Then, Charles IV expelled all French Jews without the one-year period he had promised them, as much of Europe blamed the Black Plague on the Jews and tortured them so they would confess that they poisoned the wells. Despite the pleas of innocence of Pope Clement VI, the accusations resulted in the destruction of over 60 large and 150 small Jewish communities.

In 1348, hundreds of Jews were burned and many were baptized in Basel. The city&#x27;s Christian residents converted the synagogue into a church and destroyed the Jewish cemetery there. Pope Clement VI issued an edict repudiating the libel against Jews, saying that they too were suffering from the Plague. In 1385, German Emperor Wenceslaus arrested Jews living in the Swabian League, a group of free cities in Germany, and confiscated their books. Later, he expelled the Jews of Strassburg after a community debate. In 1391, Ferrand Martinez, archdeacon of Ecija, began a campaign against Spanish Jewry, killing over 10,000 and destroying the Jewish quarter in Barcelona. The campaign quickly spread throughout Spain, except for Granada, and destroyed Jewish communities in Valencia and Palma De Majorca. King Pedro I ordered Spain not to harm the remaining Jews and that synagogues not be converted into churches. He then announced his compliance with the Bull of Pope Boniface IX, protecting Jews from baptism. He extended this edict to Spanish Jewish refugees. Benedict XIII banned the study of the Talmud in any form, as institutions forced Christian sermons and tried to restrict Jewish life completely, and a few years later Pope Martin V favorably reinstated old privileges of the Jews. After more Jews were expelled from France, some remained in Provence until 1500. In 1422, Pope Martin V issued a bull reminding Christians that Christianity was derived from Judaism and warned the Friars not to incite against the Jews, but the Bull was withdrawn the following year. By the end of the 15th century, the Inquisition was established in Spain. Around 1500 Jews found relative security and a renewal of prosperity in present-day Poland.

===The Crusades===

The trials the Jews periodically endured in the various Christian West kingdoms echoed the catastrophes that occurred during Crusades. In the First Crusade (1096) flourishing communities on the Rhine and the Danube were utterly destroyed. Furthermore, there were also attacks on the Jews that lived in cities along the Rhine.
Prior to these attacks, many Jews were seen as integral members of society despite religious differences. Many Jews worked in the money lending trade. Their services allowed for societies to function financially. In one case Jewish moneylenders were responsible for financially maintaining a monastery. Without these loans the monastery would have been unable to survive. However, this fiscal responsibility that the Jews carried might have caused tensions amongst the middle and upper class. These sects of society would not have approved of the power that the Jewish communities held. At this point there were no strictly Jewish communities. Jews were not concentrated in one area, rather their presence was spread over a larger geographical region. Oftentimes a few families lived immersed in a predominantly Christian settlement. The Jewish families were comfortable in this setting and functioned successfully. In some circumstances, Christians both accepted and welcomed the Jews. When violence against the Jewish people began to occur some Christians attempted to protect their fellow neighbors. In the town of Cologne, Jews fled to the homes of their Christian neighbors where they were given shelter. Christians discussed the topic of conversion with the Jews. There existed a theory that if the Jews were to convert to Christianity then they would no longer be the target of such violence. There were discussions regarding conversion to Christianity. Religious leaders including Bishops and Archbishops alike tried to spare the Jews from violence. One Archbishop from Mainz went so far as to offer monetary bribes to protect Jewish families. These Jews did not want relief from the exile that occurred hundreds of years prior, moreover they saw the towns in which they had immigrated to as their homes. They were well received members of the community. In the Second Crusade (1147) the Jews in France suffered especially under Louis VII. Philip Augustus treated them with exceptional severity. In his days the Third Crusade took place (1188); and the preparations for it proved to be momentous for the English Jews. After being the victims of increasing oppression Jews were banished from England in 1290; and 365 years passed before they were allowed to settle again in the British Isles. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the Shepherds&#x27; Crusades of 1251 and 1320.

====Protection attempts by Christians during the First Crusade====

During the First Crusade of 1096, there are documented accounts of Christian attempts to protect Jews from their violent attackers. The first of such attempts was carried out by the archbishop of Mainz, located in the Rhineland of Germany, in response to local Jews who had organized a bribe in return for the archbishop&#x27;s protection. Although the archbishop at first accepted the bribe, community leaders persuaded him to protect the Jews&#x27; money instead of taking it, while still offering them refuge in his quarters. Ultimately, the archbishop&#x27;s rescue attempt was unsuccessful. Crusaders, aided by some townspeople, eventually stormed the archbishop&#x27;s chamber and slaughtered the Jews hiding there.

In another instance, the bishop of Trier offered to keep Jews safe from Crusaders in his palace; however, local intimidation eventually forced him to abandon those whom he had previously aided. Because the bishop had no ancestry or allies in Trier, he felt that he could not muster the political power needed to carry out a successful resistance without the support of the townspeople. Instead, he offered the Jews an ultimatum: convert to Christianity or leave the palace. When doing so, he remarked, “You cannot be saved—Your God does not wish to save you now as he did in earlier days.”

In Cologne, Jews were protected by local gentiles after violence had broken out at the beginning of Shavuot, a Jewish holiday. During the two days of Shavuot, one Jewish woman was killed by Crusaders while venturing to the safety of a Christian neighbor&#x27;s home, where her husband was waiting for her. However, the vast majority of Jews in Cologne survived Shavuot because local Christians had reached out and offered their homes as a means of asylum from the Crusaders.

===Jewish-Christian relations===

The relations of Jews and Christians were fraught with tensions about the death of Jesus and the Christian perception of Jewish obstinacy in refusing to accept the only faith the Christians knew in the world. The pressure on Jews to accept Christianity was intense. Recent years have seen a debate among historians on the nature of Jewish-Christian relations in medieval Europe. Traditionally, historians focused on the trials Jews had to endure in this period. Christian violence towards Jews was rife, as were ritual murder accusations, expulsions, and extortion. However, recently historians have begun to show evidence of other relationships between Jews and Christians, suggesting Jews were more embedded into Christian society than was previously thought.

Since the time of the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church upheld the &quot;Constitutio pro Judæis&quot; (Formal Statement on the Jews), which stated: 

According to Anna Sapir Abulafia, most scholars agree that Jews and Christians in Latin Christendom lived in relative peace with one another until the thirteenth century. &quot;Officially, the medieval Catholic church never advocated the expulsion of all the Jews from Christendom, or repudiated Augustine&#x27;s doctrine of Jewish witness... Still, late medieval Christendom frequently ignored its mandates...&quot;

Jonathan Elukin is one historian who thinks in this vein, as elucidated in his book &quot;Living Together, Living Apart&quot;. He shows that during the Crusades, some Jews were hidden and protected from being attacked by Christians. Some Jews worked in Christian villages. There were also several cases of conversion to Judaism as well as interfaith marriages.

One such case was Jacob ben Sullam, a Christian looking to become a part of Jewish society. He chose to &quot;slaughter [himself]&quot; of his Christian identity in the hope of being accepted as a Jew in the Jewish community.

As Christians sought conversion to Judaism, a number of Jews similarly wanted to convert to Christianity. For example, Herman, a Jew who adopted Christianity to the degree that his family worried that he would reject his Jewish heritage completely. Herman&#x27;s conversion startled the rabbis and made them fear losing other Jews to Christianity.

The close bonds between Jewish and Christian neighbors led to Jewish communities thriving in some Christian cities. Jews experienced economic security and prosperity in their communities, even while enduring constant threats of violence. Though strict constraints were placed on Jews in the thirteenth century by the French monarchy, Jews continued to experience a stable living situation. Although the French monarchy prohibited the creation of Jewish religious centers, friendly relations with Christians enabled them to build a synagogue in Béziers in 1278. After being expelled from certain areas in Europe, Jews regularly returned to their old places of residence, if they had previously experienced a prosperous life there.

Another such historian is Ivan Marcus. The section of his book &quot;Cultures of the Jews&quot;, &quot;Jewish-Christian Symbiosis&quot; deals with the relationship between Christians and Ashkenazi Jews. Marcus claims that the time is written off as a time of intolerance against Jews living in Europe. For Marcus times of persecution were rarities and few and far between. The two communities lived amongst each other and interacted socially on an everyday basis. They interacted at such a personal level both Christian and Jewish leaders thought that the other group would heavily influence their respective faiths. When persecution did occur however it was only the more drastic measures that stopped the close interactions between the two groups. Had the intense violence described in other sources been the standard for living condition of the Askkenazi Jews then they would not have survived the era let alone their culture which is the roots for many Jews today.
During times of persecution against the Jews, chronicles show that Christian friends provided some of them aid and shelter. A chronicler tells a story of a Jewish woman who is given food and shelter for two days from a gentile acquaintance during a time of violence against the Jews during Shavuot. This gentile acquaintance is believed to be Christian. Also, the chronicles show that some Christians converted to Judaism during these times. Some converts even sacrificed themselves in order to show their loyalty to the Jewish community.

In England, many Jews worked and lived in small, mostly Christian towns. Historians interpret this as Jews feeling comfortable living and working in places surrounded by Christians. Another example some historians use to show Jewish attachment to their place in Western Christendom is the Jewish expulsion in France. After they were expelled in 1182, they returned in 1198.

Through some of the Christian world, Jews enjoyed privileges at the hands of nobles and even kings that were almost equal to the local Christians. For example, in the Crown of Aragon, in 1241, King James of Aragon issued a decree that the Jewish community of Barcelona would be given the right to elect members of the Jewish community to police itself and investigate Jewish criminals and crimes within the Jewish community. Once the elected police force caught a criminal, they were given the right to impose fines (paid to the crown, not the Jewish community), banish them from the Jewish quarter, or even banish them entirely from the city of Barcelona. Further, these elected members were given the authority to judge cases between Jews in a court of law. In 1271, King James issued a similar decree with a sense of increased urgency which suggests that things had become volatile among the Jewish community, or that the perception of the Jewish community was overwhelmingly one of a state of chaos. This second decree also increased the rights of the council to whatever punishments they deem to be &quot;convenient to the community,&quot; including any punishments that they deemed fit.

Even after multiple expulsions and persecutions, some Jews still returned to their hometowns. Once they returned, many prospered. In spite of royal restrictions attempting to limit their success. They built new synagogues.

These examples are used by some historians to shine a light on a more positive relationship between the two religious groups. These historians believe that these stories of aid, neighborliness, and prosperity are more notable and significant than previously recognized.

Scattered violence toward Jews occasionally took place during riots led by mobs, local leaders, and lower level clergy without the support of church leaders who generally followed Augustine&#x27;s teachings.

However, some historians do not agree with this view of history. Historian Daniel J. Lasker does not see the relationship of Christians and Jews in the same light. He contends that the expulsions Jews in Spain faced in 1492 were the product of the revolts seen a century earlier in 1391. Even though the relationship might have been positive, it ended on a negative note. The expulsions of the Jews in various regions is that ending, with a wide range of reasons behind them not just religion. The reason for the Jews returning to regions they were expelled from was not acceptance as to what happened, but a sense of comfort and familiarity. While Lasker acknowledges that Jews and Christians as having some positive relationships he does not want to write off the tension of the area.

===Accusations of ritual murder, blood libel and host desecration===

Although the first known mention of blood libel is found in the writings of Apion (30–20 BCE to 45 or 48 CE), who claimed that the Jews sacrificed Greeks in the Temple of Jerusalem, no other mention is recorded until the 12th century, when blood libels began to proliferate.

Jews were frequently accused of ritual murder and of using human blood (especially, the blood of Christian children) to make matzah. In many cases, these &quot;blood libels&quot; led to the Catholic Church regarding the victims as martyrs. The Catholic Church canonized children in over 20 such cases. England seems to have counted for the first and most important examples of these. The most influential and widely-known of these is Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln (d. 1255 and written about in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;) and Simon of Trent (d. 1475). It gained particular currency because of the intervention of Henry III of England, who ordered the death of the Coping, the first to &#x27;confess&#x27;, and a further 91 Jews to be arrested, leading to 18 being executed. Nevertheless, the rest were released despite their conviction, after monks and his brother Richard interceded.

One example of Christian hostility towards Jews is the Accusation of Ritual Murder at Blois. The story follows a Jewish man and a Christian servant watering their horses at the same bend in a river. The Jewish man accidentally scared the Christian&#x27;s horse with the white corner of his undershirt and the servant rode away, upset about the frightened beast, and told his master he saw the Jew throw a child in the river. The Christian master, who hated Jews, took this opportunity and had the Jew unlawfully accused of murder. The Christians took the man, along with the Jews who had tried to free him, beating and torturing them in the effort that they would abandon their religion. To no avail, the Jews were burned alive.

In some cases, the authorities spoke against the accusations, for example Pope Innocent III wrote in 1199:

No Christian shall do the Jews any personal injury, except in executing the judgments of a judge, or deprive them of their possessions, or change the rights and privileges which they have been accustomed to have. During the celebration of their festivals, no one shall disturb them by beating them with clubs or by throwing stones at them. No one shall compel them to render any services except those which they have been accustomed to render. And to prevent the baseness and avarice of wicked men we forbid anyone to deface or damage their cemeteries or to extort money from them by threatening to exhume the bodies of their dead.
The charge was circulated that they wished to dishonor the Host, which Roman Catholics believe is the body of Jesus Christ.

===Black Death===
When the Black Death raged through Europe (1346–53), the charge was given that the Jews had poisoned the wells. The only court of appeal that regarded itself as their appointed protector, according to historical conceptions, was the &quot;Holy Roman Emperor.&quot; The emperor, as legal successor to Titus, who had acquired the Jews for his special property through the destruction of the Temple in the year 70, claimed the rights of possession and protection over all the Jews in the former Roman empire.

===Expulsions===

In 1275, Edward I of England issued a decree forbidding Jews from lending money with interests, while allowing Jews to engage in craft, commerce and farming. The Jews, who were driven out of England in 1290, out of France in 1394, out of numerous districts of Germany, Italy, and the Balkan peninsula between 1200 and 1600, were scattered in all directions, and fled preferably to the new Slavic kingdoms, where for the time being other confessions were still tolerated. Most fled to Poland, as it had a reputation for religious tolerance unparalleled during this era. This religious tolerance may have also been a byproduct of the fact that Lithuania was the last country in Europe to become Christianized. Here they found a sure refuge under benevolent rulers and acquired a certain prosperity, in the enjoyment of which the study of the Talmud was followed with renewed vigor. Together with their faith, they took with them the German language and customs, which they then cultivated in a Slavic environment with unexampled faithfulness for centuries.

==== Spain ====

As in Slavic countries, so also under Muslim rule, the persecuted Jews often found a humane reception, especially from the 8th century onward on the Iberian peninsula. But even as early as the 13th century the Arabs could no longer offer a real resistance to the advancing force of Christian kings; and with the fall of political power Arabic culture declined, after having been transmitted to the Occident at about the same period, chiefly through the Jews in the north of Spain and in the south of France. At that time there was no field of learning the Spanish Jews did not cultivate. They studied the secular sciences with the same zeal as the Bible and Talmud.

But the growing influence of the Church gradually crowded them out of this advantageous position. At first, the attempt was made to win them to Christianity through writings and religious disputations; and when these attempts failed they were ever more and more restricted in the exercise of their civil rights. Soon they were obliged to live in separate quarters of the cities and to wear humiliating badges on their clothing. Thereby they were made a prey to the scorn and hatred of their fellow citizens. In 1391, when a fanatical mob killed four thousand Jews in Seville alone, many in their fright sought refuge in baptism. And although they often continued to observe in secret the laws of their fathers the Inquisition soon rooted out these pretended Christians or Marranos. Thousands were thrown into prison, tortured, and burned, until a project was formed to sweep all Spain clean of unbelievers. The plan matured when in 1492 the last Moorish fortress fell into the hands of the Christians. Queen Isabella of Spain issued an edict banishing all Jews from Spain for acts of, ‘a serious a detestable crime,’ a reference to the purported ritual murder of the infant Christopher of La Guardia, which was tried in court in 1491, and who was later made into a Saint. Many of the Jews fled to the Balkan peninsula, where a few decades before Ottoman Turks had won a victory over the Cross. Sultan Bayazid II of the Ottoman Empire, learning about the expulsion of Jews from Spain, dispatched the Ottoman Navy to bring the Jews safely to Ottoman lands, mainly to the cities of Salonica (currently in Greece) and Smyrna (currently in Turkey). Judeo-Spanish also known as Ladino (a form of medieval Spanish influenced by Hebrew) was widely spoken amongst some of the Jewish communities in Europe since the 15th century.

==Renaissance==
===Italy===
Italian dukes in the Renaissance era accorded protections to resident Jewish communities for a range of political or economic reasons. However, the local authorities rigorously attempted to impose Jewish badges. Franciscan friars exerted pressure on the dukes to enforce the wearing of yellow badges by Jews which the dukes resisted. Taxation records reveal a great quantity of Jewish contribution to the duchy&#x27;s finances. The Jewish tax contribution in the state budget was 0.2% in 1460. By 1480 this had increased to 1%. In 1482, 6% of the extraordinary tax came from Jewish communities. This evidence indicates the wealth of the Jewish population and also indicates a possible population boom. However, Jews lost support from Ludovico Sforza on the eve of the Italian wars.

===Spain===
There was no progress towards inter faith harmony in 15th century Spain. Mark Meyerson notes the silence of 15th century records on the Jewish-Christian relations in Morvedre. In that town Jews constituted a quarter of the urban population and had a significant contribution to the area&#x27;s economy. The Jewish situation varied across Spain. The Jewish quarter of Cervera was sacked by Catalan troops and they warned Jews in Tarrega of the same fate. These events set off the emigration of affluent &quot;converso&quot; households from Barcelona. The situation was less severe for Jews and &quot;conversos&quot; in Aragon. In the kingdom of Aragon the strong Jewish ties to the monarchy, in the form of political support, revenue supplies and assistance, ensured their relatively safer position. The introduction of credit mechanisms by the Jews in Morvedre facilitated the Jewish revival in the region and granted the Jews dominance in the kingdom&#x27;s credit markets. The Jewish community as a whole generally functioned with economic success. The Jewish economic activity was diversified not only in the kingdom of Valencia but also in the kingdom of Aragon. Jews continued lending sums to non-Jews and Jewish usury was no longer contested in public, and religious relations remained stable and unmarred by violent activity.

===France===
Jews enjoyed a time of prosperity until the end of the 15th century in Provence. There were no significant legal distinctions between the citizenship rights of Jews and Christians under the statutes of Marseilles. Jews were officially given the same citizenship rights in Saint-Remy-de-Provence in 1345 and by 1467 in Tarascon. Comtat Venaissin and Avignon, both being papal principalities, witnessed an era of peace for Jewish communities who were established there without expulsions being a part of their lives. The Jews of Provence received official protection but this was because of Jewish usefulness for the royalty. This did not, however, preclude anti-Jewish incidences which precipitated voluntary Jewish departures. Once Provence was annexed by the Kingdom of France in 1481, the flourishing Jewish residents found themselves expelled by 1498.

==Enlightenment==
According to most scholars, the Middle Ages ended around 1500–1550, giving way to the Early Modern Era, c. 1550–1789. The Enlightenment appeared at the end of the Early Modern Era, and was characterized by a set of values and ideas that completely opposed the previous medieval age. The Enlightened Monarch was an important product of the era; he or she strove to create a cultured, modern state populated by effective subjects, and often began the journey to this state by improving the living conditions of the poor and minorities, which included Jews in most countries. The monarchs tried to include their Jewish subjects in mainstream society, reducing restrictions and passing more general laws that applied to all, regardless of religion.

A Jewish Enlightenment occurred alongside the broader European one, originally appearing at the end of the eighteenth century. Known as Haskalah, it would re-emerge in the 1820s and lasted for the better part of the century. A form of &quot;critical rationalism&quot; inspired by the European Enlightenment, Haskalah focused on reform in two specific areas: stimulating an internal rebirth of culture, and better preparing and training Jews to exist in a christocentric world. It did not force its adherents to sacrifice one identity for the other, allowing them to simultaneously be Jewish and emulate their Gentile contemporaries. One of the most important effects of the Enlightenment was emancipation for Jews. Beginning in Napoleonic France after the Revolution-which was directly inspired by the Enlightenment-Jews received full rights and became equal citizens. This trend spread eastward across the continent, lasting until 1917, when Russian Jews were finally emancipated during the first Russian Revolution.

<text>Héctor &quot;Pity&quot; Altamirano Escudero (born 17 March 1977) is a Mexican former professional footballer who played as a right-back. He was most recently the manager of Herediano.

==Club career==
Altamirano made his debut in the Primera División in the 1997 Winter season with Cruz Azul after coming up through their youth ranks. However, after a less than satisfactory year with only six appearances, he transferred to Santos Laguna. Since joining Santos, Altamirano has become a constant danger on the team&#x27;s right flank, and in his six years with the club, he has started 212 games and scored 36 goals. After his successful spell with Santos Laguna, the Mexican footballer was sold to newly ascended San Luis during the summer 2005 transfer window, or the &quot;Draft&quot;, as it is commonly known in Mexico. After a successful year at San Luis in which Altamirano helped the club reach a league final, Altamirano joined CA Monarcas Morelia during the summer of 2006. With no big success he was then transferred to Tecos.

Altamirano joined Correcaminos for the Apertura 2008–09 season.

More recently, he is venturing into new business enterprises outside of professional football. He announced on April 6, 2016, in an interview with Reforma that he is opening a mid-size fish aquarium in San Luis, a city he represented as a player. His aquarium hosts mostly sea fish and mammals, including white sharks and orcas.

<doc id="1263397" wikidata="Q899032" url="?curid=1263397" title="Nuclear Assault">
<text>Nuclear Assault was an American thrash metal band formed in New York City in 1984. Part of the mid-to-late 1980s thrash metal movement, they were one of the main bands of the genre to emerge from the East Coast along with Overkill, Whiplash, Toxik, Carnivore, and Anthrax, the last of which was co-founded by Nuclear Assault bassist Dan Lilker, who had left Anthrax shortly after the release of their first album. Nuclear Assault released five full-length albums and toured relentlessly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, and broke up in 1995. The band reunited briefly in 1997, and permanently from 2001 to 2008 and again from 2011 to 2022.

Nuclear Assault has released six studio albums to date, in addition to two live albums, four EPs and one compilation album. Their most successful records are &quot;Survive&quot; (1988) and &quot;Handle with Care&quot; (1989), which peaked at Nos. 145 and 126 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, respectively. Other than four new songs in 2015 on the EP &quot;Pounder&quot;, the band did not release any more full-length studio albums after 2005&#x27;s &quot;Third World Genocide&quot;, but continued to perform live sporadically over the following years before calling it quits once again in 2022.

==History==
===Early career (1984–1985)===
After the release of Anthrax&#x27;s debut album &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot;, bassist Dan Lilker, a founding member of the group, was fired by the band. He decided to pursue a more aggressive style of music and formed Nuclear Assault with guitarist/vocalist John Connelly, who had been involved in an early version of Anthrax. They were joined by guitarist Mike Bogush and drummer Scott Duboys (later of Cities, Cycle Sluts from Hell and Warrior Soul). They then recorded the first of two demos, which included the songs &quot;Stranded in Hell&quot;, &quot;The Plague&quot;, and &quot;Hang the Pope&quot;.

The group&#x27;s first live performance was at the Union Jack in South River, New Jersey, in late 1984. Bogush was later replaced by Anthony Bramante. Bramante&#x27;s first live performance with the group was at L&#x27;Amour in Brooklyn, New York, in April 1985. Shortly after the performance, Duboys left the band and was replaced by drummer Glenn Evans formerly of New Jersey–based band T.T. Quick.

===First three albums and rise to fame (1986–1990)===
Nuclear Assault&#x27;s second demo &quot;Live, Suffer, Die&quot; was recorded in 1985 and they began touring the United States consistently. The band signed a multi-album contract with Combat Records and recorded the &quot;Game Over&quot; album in April 1986, released to critical acclaim later that year. &quot;Game Over&quot; was followed by an extended play called &quot;The Plague&quot;, which was released to coincide with a 1987 European tour with Agent Steel and Atomkraft. Later, feeling constrained by their contract with Combat, the band signed with I.R.S. Records and released &quot;Survive&quot; in 1988. The album reached number 145 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and Nuclear Assault set off on a 180-day world tour in the United States and Europe; first as an opening act for Slayer and later headlining with British group Acid Reign as a support act. The Survive soundtrack was featured in the underground film on I.R.S. Media &quot;Blood &amp; Concrete&quot;. The band&#x27;s next album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Handle with Care&quot;, would see the band at their commercial peak, hitting the U.S. chart at number 126, and peaking in the UK Albums Chart at No. 60, with more touring, including a trip to Japan and a U.S. tour opening for Testament and Savatage. The band released their first live album, &quot;Live at the Hammersmith Odeon&quot;, in 1990, but internal troubles were causing problems for the band.

===Two more albums, departure of Lilker and split (1991–1995)===
Constant touring and recording was taking its toll on the band, and there was a rumor that the band might split. The recording of &quot;Out of Order&quot; was problematic as all four members were in the process of making solo projects. Lead songwriter Connelly was conspicuously absent from the recording process. He only sang on five of the songs and played the guitar on one (&quot;Quocustodiat&quot; was his only full writing credit), leaving Evans and Lilker to do most of the recording alone. &quot;Out of Order&quot; was poorly received, and during the subsequent tour in 1991 to 1992, there was some line-up shuffling – Connelly moved to vocals only for a time with second guitarist Dave DiPietro joining in 1992. Founding member Lilker departed to concentrate on Brutal Truth and longtime guitarist Bramante followed by the end of the year.

Undaunted, Connolly, Evans and DiPietro recorded &quot;Something Wicked&quot; for IRS/EMI in 1993 with new bassist Scott Metaxas, the title track featuring in the film . Reviews again were somewhat unfavorable, as Nuclear Assault struggled to adapt to a less thrash-friendly music scene. After touring Europe and the US for much of 1993 the band returned with a new line up of Dave Spitz on bass and a returning Bramante, joining Connelly and Evans for more North American touring before slowly coming to a halt in early 1995.The band contributed their take on &quot;Die Hard&quot; for a Venom tribute album in 1995 before calling it a day.

Nuclear Assault&#x27;s classic lineup later reunited for one concert in 1997 (put on by Eric Paone of Candy Striper Death Orgy in New Hampshire) then, two more shows the following year with Eric Paone on bass guitar in New England before parting ways a second time.

===Nuclear Assault in the 21st century (2002–2022)===
The classic lineup reformed once again in 2002 to perform at the Metal Meltdown and Wacken festivals and subsequently recorded a live album entitled &quot;Alive Again&quot;, Bramante leaving for the last time and adding guitarist Eric Burke in time for several European tours, first with Testament and Death Angel, and then with Exodus and Agent Steel, both in 2003. A new studio album entitled &quot;Third World Genocide&quot; followed in 2005, with yet more touring, including a South American tour with Death Angel. and a headlining European tour. The band released the &quot;Louder, Faster, Harder&quot; DVD before more US touring in 2006.

From 2007 to 2012 Nuclear Assault occasionally played shows, returning to Japan and South America along with a guest appearance at the Maryland Deathfest and at the Metal Merchants Festival in Oslo, Norway, in January 2011.

In 2013, it was announced that Nuclear Assault was working on a new album, which was due for release in 2015. They instead released an EP on June 1, 2015, titled &quot;Pounder&quot;, which featured &quot;four killer old-school thrash&quot; songs written by Dan Lilker and John Connelly. The band embarked on the &quot;Final Assault&quot; tour to support the EP in 2015 to 2016. By 2022, however, Nuclear Assault had continued to perform live sporadically, mostly in South America as well as both the East Coast and West Coast of the United States.

On November 20, 2022, Nuclear Assault announced on social media that they had again broken up.

<text>First Nations Bank of Canada (FNBC) () is the first Canadian chartered bank to be independently controlled by Indigenous shareholders. FNBC is a Schedule 1 Federally Regulated Bank in accordance with the &quot;Bank Act&quot; and received its charter on 19 November 1996. The bank headquarters are located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.

As of 2014, Indigenous Canadian groups own 80 percent of the bank.

==History==
It began as a venture initiated by First Nations in Saskatchewan and was established in 1996 as a strategic alliance of the Saskatchewan Indian Equity Foundation, the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations, now the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (a First Nations organisation), and TD Bank. The first branch opened in Saskatoon. A ceremony was held in Toronto in 1996 to celebrate the bank&#x27;s launch.
The bank focuses on commercial customers in markets dominated by Indigenous peoples, including Indigenous businesses, Indigenous governments and organizations, and non-Indigenous businesses serving Indigenous markets.

The bank also has a growing volume of personal loans and mortgages primarily focused in its growing branch network of nine full service branches and eight community banking centres in markets with significant numbers of Indigenous peoples.

At the end of 2009, the First Nations Bank had lent $160.2 million, with assets totalling $266.5 million. The profit increased from 2008 to 2009 from 8,000 to 157,000 dollars. In 2010, the bank reported an income of $10.2 million.

The bank officially de-coupled from TD Bank in 2012. The two banks had entered into a seven-year partnership starting in 2007.

The bank is majority owned by 78 Indigenous shareholders that hold, in aggregate, over 80% ownership interest in the shares of the bank.

<text>The 1998 Major League Soccer season was the third season of Major League Soccer. It was also the 86th season of FIFA-sanctioned soccer in the United States, and the 20th with a national first-division league. 

The Chicago Fire and Miami Fusion played their inaugural seasons as the league&#x27;s first two expansion teams.

The NY/NJ MetroStars dropped the New York/New Jersey from their name and rebranded as just MetroStars, with no city, state or regional name attached to it.

The regular season began on March 15, and concluded on September 27. The MLS Cup Playoffs began on September 30, and concluded with MLS Cup on October 25. Chicago became the first expansion team to win MLS Cup and the first to win it in its inaugural season.

==Overview==

===Season format===
The season began on March 15 and concluded with MLS Cup on October 25. The 12 teams were split evenly into two conferences. Each team played 32 games that were evenly divided between home and away. Each team played every other team in their conference four times, for a total of 20 games. The remaining schedule consisted of two games against each team from the opposite conference.

The top four teams from each conference qualified for the MLS Cup Playoffs. The conference semifinals and finals were played as a best-of-three series, and the winners advanced to MLS Cup. In all rounds, draws were broken by penalty shootout if necessary. The away goals rule was not used in any round.

The team with the most points in the regular season was awarded the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield and qualified automatically for the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. Additionally, the winner of MLS Cup, and the runner-up, also qualified for the Champions&#x27; Cup.

<doc id="1263403" wikidata="Q44775" url="?curid=1263403" title="Ernst Jandl">
<text>Ernst Jandl (; 1 August 1925 – 9 June 2000) was an Austrian writer, poet, and translator. He became known for his experimental lyric, mainly sound poems (&quot;Sprechgedichte&quot;) in the tradition of concrete and visual poetic forms.

== Poetry ==

Influenced by Dada he started to write experimental poetry, first published in the journal &quot;Neue Wege&quot; (&quot;New Ways&quot;) in 1952.

He was the life partner of Friederike Mayröcker. In 1973 he co-founded the Grazer Autorenversammlung in Graz, became its vice president in 1975 and was its president from 1983 to 1987.

His poems are characterized by German language word play, often at the level of single characters or phonemes. For example, his famous univocalic poem &quot;ottos mops&quot; (in English, &quot;otto&#x27;s pug&quot;) uses only the vowel &quot;o&quot;. Of course, poems like this cannot easily be translated into other languages.

Most of his poems are better heard than read. His lectures were always known as very impressive events, because of the particular way he pronounced his poems. Poems like &quot;schtzngrmm&quot; &quot;(his version of the word &quot;Schützengraben&quot; which describes the trenches of the World War I)&quot; can be understood only if read correctly. It is an experimental poem in which he tells the sounds of war only with combinations of letters, which sound like gunfires or detonating missiles.

He translated Gertrude Stein, Robert Creeley&#x27;s &quot;The Island&quot;, and John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Silence&quot;.

Some other of his best-known poems are &quot;lichtung&quot; (also known as &quot;lechts &amp; rinks&quot;, in English &quot;light &amp; reft&quot;) and &quot;kneiernzuck&quot;.

An example of a short poem, written in English:

three wives
&lt;poem&gt;
i never remember my second wife
i never remember my third wife
i always remember what i always remember
ain&#x27;t ever even had a first wife
&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="1263405" wikidata="Q255771" url="?curid=1263405" title="Equatorial Guinea national football team">
<text>The Equatorial Guinea national football team (Spanish: &quot;Selección de fútbol de Guinea Ecuatorial&quot;) represents Equatorial Guinea in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Equatoguinean Football Federation, a member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF).

The team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup, but has qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations on four occasions, the first two times as hosts (in 2012 and 2015). They finished in fourth place in 2015, and reached the quarter-finals in 2012 and 2021.

==History==
Equatorial Guinea played its first match on 23 May 1975 against China in a friendly, losing 6–2. They did not play another game until the 1985 UDEAC Cup in December 1985. They were drawn in a group against the hosts Congo and Central African Republic. They lost 5–0 to the Congo on 9 December and then earned their first draw by drawing 1–1 against the Central African Republic on 14 December. On 16 December, they played a play-off for fifth place against Chad, and lost 3–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw.

Equatorial Guinea would come in fourth in the 1987 UDEAC Cup, losing on penalties in the third place match to Gabon, even though they only scored one goal throughout the tournament in a 1–1 draw against Chad. They also drew 0–0 against Cameroon. On their next attempt, they got sixth place after losing on penalties against the Central African Republic. The next time Equatorial Guinea played the Central African Republic, in 1999, they won, 4–2. It was Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s first win.

In the late 2000s, the FEGUIFUT, along with the Gabonese Federation, announced a bid to host the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, against other African nations&#x27; bids, including Angola, Libya and Nigeria. Equatorial Guinea and Gabon won the right to host the games, and two new stadiums were built in Equatorial Guinea: Estadio de Bata in Bata and Estadio de Malabo in Malabo.

The first game in the 2012 African Cup of Nations was also Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s first participation in a major international tournament, and resulted in a historic 1–0 win over Libya on 21 January 2012 in the opening game of the tournament. An 87th-minute strike from former Real Madrid winger Javier Balboa earned the victory. In the next game, they secured the qualification for the quarter-finals by beating Senegal 2–1, and finished second in their group after losing 0–1 to Zambia. They progressed to the quarter-finals where they were eliminated by the tournament&#x27;s runners-up Ivory Coast, losing 3–0 with goals from Didier Drogba and Yaya Touré. Various national side players were praised due to their performances in the tournament, including Javier Balboa, Randy, Ben Konaté and Rui, the latter a part of the Team of the Tournament.

Three years after that Africa Cup of Nations, Equatorial Guinea organized solely the 2015 edition, but this time, to replace Morocco, the original host. In the opener, they drew 1–1 against Congo, with Emilio Nsue scoring first. In the second game, they managed to play out a 0–0 draw with Burkina Faso, the runners-up of the previous edition. With these two results, the &quot;Nzalang Nacional&quot; had to win against its classic rival Gabon in the third match in order to qualify for the quarter-finals. Equatorial Guinea won 2–0 with goals from Javier Balboa (a penalty kick) and Ibán. As Group A&#x27;s runner-up, the Equatoguinean national team then defeated Tunisia 2–1 with two goals from Balboa, the first being a penalty kick in the final moments of the regular time, and the second was in extra time. In the semi-final, however, they lost 0–3 to Ghana, and in the match for third place, drew 0–0 against DR Congo, ultimately losing 2–4 on penalties. The country finished the tournament in fourth place, being its best international participation to date and helping it reach a historical 49th position in the FIFA rankings.

===2021 Africa Cup of Nations===
Equatorial Guinea failed to qualify for 2017 and 2019 editions of the African Cup of Nations. Likewise, the team had also didn&#x27;t qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. During the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, they were grouped in group J along with powerhouse Tunisia, 2019 AFCON participant Tanzania and North African bedfellow Libya. The Nzalang Nacional performed poorly in their first two games, losing both with one goal margin to Tanzania away and Tunisia at home, and it appeared that Equatorial Guinea would just end up failing as usual as the team had never qualified throughout regular qualification outside hosting the competition twice.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic led all AFCON qualification suspended until late 2020, when it resumed as Equatorial Guinea faced up against a rising spirit Libyan side that aimed to qualify for the first time since 2012. Despite this, Equatorial Guinea produced an outstanding comeback against Libya in Egypt, beating Libya 3–2 with two late goals by Pedro Obiang and Salomón Obama from being led 1–2 until injury times. The Nzalang Nacional later hosted the same opponent at home, and like their game in Cairo, the Equatorial Guineans won again, 1–0, by virtual goal from Iban Salvador. After beating Tanzania 1–0 on home soil, Equatorial Guinea managed a historic feat, a regular qualification for the first time ever in its history.

During AFCON 2021, the National Thunder were drawn in group E, alongside Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Algeria. Equatorial Guinea lost their opening match against Ivory Coast, but produced one of the tournament&#x27;s surprised when they defeated trophy holders Algeria in their second match. In their final match of the group, they defeated Sierra Leone and qualified for the round of 16, coming in second in the group, after Ivory Coast.

In the round of 16, Equatorial Guinea was drawn against Mali, the winners of group F. The game ended in a goalless draw after 120 minutes and went to deciding penalties, where the Nzalang Nacional won the shoot-out 6–5 thanks to the heroics of goalkeeper Jesús Owono, who saved two of the shots. This meant that the national team qualified for the quarter finals of AFCON for the third time in their history and the first one advancing from the round of 16. They subsequently lost to eventual champions Senegal, 3-1.

==Naturalised players controversy==

In recent years, Equatorial Guinea has courted controversy by recruiting foreign players and giving them citizenship despite having little or no ties to the country. In 2009, South African journalist and FIFA archivist Mark Gleeson wrote that it was undermining the integrity of African football.

In late 2005, and at the request of Ruslán Obiang Nsue, a son of President Teodoro Obiang, Brazilian coach Antônio Dumas recruited several Brazilian players to represent the Equatorial Guinea but the CAF and FIFA turned a blind eye, despite complaints from other nations.

In 2012, having lost the first leg of a 2013 Africa Cup of Nations qualification round 4–0 to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea recruited nine Brazilian players to help overturn the deficit for the second leg. The team did manage to win the match 2–1, but it was not enough to overturn the aggregate and Equatorial Guinea were eliminated. DR Congo head coach Claude Le Roy complained that the Equatorial Guinea were acting like the &quot;United Nations of football&quot;.

Before the arrival of new coach Andoni Goikoetxea to Malabo, in March 2013, the Equatoguinean board made the squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Cape Verde and again called-up nine Brazilian players. In May 2013, they joined Colombian-born, Equatorian-based Jimmy Bermúdez, who was going to be paid €3,000 for each match he played.

During the 2015 qualifiers, in the games played against Mauritania, the &quot;Nzalang Nacional&quot; lost 1–0 away and won 3–0 in Malabo, qualifying to the next round to face Uganda. However, the Mauritanian Football Federation submitted a complaint to CAF about the inclusion of ineligible players by Equatorial Guinea (some with fake passports and false names), resulting in the expulsion of the Equatorial Guinean team, based on the particular situation of Thierry Fidjeu, while the cases of the other players remained under investigation. However, they were reinstated after Morocco withdrew from hosting due to Ebola outbreak.

Emilio Nsue, who played for Spanish youth national teams from 2005 to 2011, played two matches of Equatorial Guinea in 2013. A few months later, FIFA declared him ineligible for that match and for the return fixture, awarding both games to Cape Verde by a 3–0 scoreline. Nsue did not gain Equatoguinean nationality until after playing official matches for Spain and the Equatoguinean Football Federation did not ask FIFA for permission to switch allegiances. Nsue continued to play for Equatorial Guinea despite FIFA declaring his ineligibility, including the 2015, 2021, and 2023 editions of the African Cup of Nations. In June 2024, FIFA judges ruled that Nsue was never eligible to play for Equatorial Guinea throughout his entire career. He had allegedly use a fraudulent Equatoguinean passport in which it is stated that he was born in Malabo, instead of Palma de Mallorca.

==Home stadium==
Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s home stadium is Estadio de Malabo in the same name city. It can hold up to 15,250 people. Equatorial Guinea played there when they hosted the Afcon 2012 and they played against eventual winners Zambia and runners-up, the Ivory Coast. They also played in the newly constructed Estadio de Bata, where they won both their games against Libya and Senegal.

==Kit and colours==
Equatorial Guinea wears a red and white uniform. The kit manufacturer is Erreà. When they play in Equatorial Guinea, they wear a solid red jersey and matching shorts with white stripes. The number, FEGUIFUT logo, and Erreà logo are located on the chest. The socks are red with white at the top. When Equatorial Guinea is away, they wear all white shirt with blue stripes.

==Rivalries==
===Tunisia===
The rivalry with Tunisia is unique over the fact that these meetings are more recent and used to be regarded as unimportant, but the root fuelling this rivalry occurred during the quarter-finals of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, in which the Tunisians got a string of unfair decisions from the referee, which caused the team to lose to the Equatorial Guinean hosts 2–1, fuelled widespread rage and anger among Tunisian players and fans. Ever since, Tunisia and Equatorial Guinea have found themselves surprisingly in confrontation of numerous recent tournament qualifications, started with the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification where Tunisia won both fixtures, albeit by one goal margin. However, despite Tunisia&#x27;s domination, Equatorial Guinea have proven to be increasingly stern in later qualifications, having managed to defeat Tunisia at home in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification and the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualification. Both national teams are again scheduled to face each other at the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification.

===Gabon===
Equatorial Guinea classic rival is its neighbor Gabon. Disputed territories are a main cause in this rivalry. Their first recognized match was on 18 December 1987 and it ended in a 4-3 win for Gabon via penalty shoot-out after a goalless draw. After five loses over the next 15 years, Equatorial Guinea would earn its first win on 8 June 2003, a 2-1 at home, during the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations qualification. This result is among the most celebrated Equatorial Guinea matches ever by local fans. They also had a notable 2-0 victory over Gabon at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, which allowed them to pass the group stage, eliminating Gabon in the process.

<text>The Second Assessment Report (SAR) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in 1995, is an assessment of the then available scientific and socio-economic information on climate change. The report was split into four parts: a synthesis to help interpret UNFCCC article 2, &quot;The Science of Climate Change&quot; (Working Group I), &quot;Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation of Climate Change&quot; (WG II), &quot;Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change&quot; (WG III). Each of the last three parts was completed by a separate Working Group (WG), and each has a Summary for Policymakers (SPM) that represents a consensus of national representatives. 

The SPM of the WG I report contains the following statements: Greenhouse gas concentrations have continued to increase; anthropogenic aerosols tend to produce negative radiative forcings; climate has changed over the past century (air temperature has increased by between 0.3 and 0.6 °C since the late 19th century; this estimate has not significantly changed since the 1990 report); The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate (considerable progress since the 1990 report in distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic influences on climate, because of: including aerosols; coupled models; pattern-based studies). Climate is expected to continue to change in the future (increasing realism of simulations increases confidence; important uncertainties remain but are taken into account in the range of model projections). Finally, the report stated that there were still many uncertainties (estimates of future emissions and biogeochemical cycling; models; instrument data for model testing, assessment of variability, and detection studies).
==Overview==
The Second Assessment Report, titled &quot;Climate Change 1995&quot;, consists of reports from each of the three Working Groups, and a Synthesis Report:

* Report of Working Group I: &quot;The Science of Climate Change&quot; .
* Report of Working Group II: &quot;Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation of Climate Change: Scientific-Technical Analyses&quot; .
* Report of Working Group III: &quot;Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change&quot; .
* The &quot;Full Report&quot;, consisting of &quot;Synthesis of Scientific-Technical Information Relevant to Interpreting Article 2 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change&quot;, and the Summaries for Policymakers from the three Working Group reports .

These reports were prepared by over two thousand experts, and &quot;contain the factual basis of the issue of climate change, gleaned from available expert literature and further carefully reviewed by experts and governments.&quot;

The Synthesis Report gave its purpose as providing the scientific, technical and socio-economic information for determining
==Conclusions==
Working Group I, dealing with the scientific aspects of climate, stated that
Working Group I subsequently characterized its reports in the First and Second Assessments as progressing from an understanding that the greenhouse effect is well understood, greenhouse gases are increasing (due largely to human activity), and therefore should lead to significant global warming (though lack of understanding limited specific regional predictions), to a greater understanding (despite continuing uncertainties) that global warming continues and is most likely due to human activity, and that very substantial cuts in emissions would be required to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations.
Working Group II assessed whether the range of plausible impacts of global warming constitutes dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, while Working Group III provided information to help countries &quot;take decisions they believe are most appropriate for their specific circumstances&quot;.

==Chapter 8: Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes==
In the IPCC process, a &quot;convening lead author&quot; for each chapter worked with other lead authors and contributing authors to agree the structure of the chapter, and assign teams of scientists to write each section of the chapter, producing a draft which was subject to acceptance by the whole author group. Participating governments then provided review comments on the draft, incorporated into the assessment which was presented to seek acceptance at a plenary session of the IPCC.

The IPCC chairman Bert Bolin had difficulty finding a convening lead author for Chapter 8. After delays, Benjamin D. Santer who was doing postdoctoral research on the topic was persuaded to take on the task. Twenty participants from various countries met at the initial meeting in Livermore, California, in August 1994 to identify the scientific topic areas, and discussion continued by email. At the first drafting session (in Sigtuna, Sweden, in October) Santer persuaded the others that the chapter should discuss observational and model uncertainties, though these were also covered in other chapters. The &quot;zeroth&quot; draft was then sent out for peer review to scientific topic experts, all the chapter authors and lead authors of other chapters. Their responses were incorporated in the second drafting session in March 1995 at Brighton. In May the entire draft Working Group I report as well as the summary for policymakers was submitted for full &quot;country review&quot; by participating governments, to provide comments for incorporation at the third drafting session at Asheville, North Carolina, in July. Because of the delayed timing, Santer did not receive government comments for this meeting, some did not arrive until the plenary meeting in November.

The Chapter 8 draft report put together on 5 October had an Executive Summary of the evidence, and after various qualifications, said &quot;Taken together, these results point towards a human influence on climate.&quot; Governments at the November plenary meeting in Madrid demanded changes to how this was worded in the Summary for Policymakers, after extended discussions Bolin suggested the adjective &quot;discernible&quot; and this was agreed. The approved Summary for Policymakers includes a section headed &quot;The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate&quot;, setting out progress in detection and attribution studies, cautioning that &quot;Our ability to quantify the human influence on global climate is currently limited because the expected signal is still emerging from the noise of natural variability, and because there are uncertainties in key factors.&quot; Santer was subsequently required by the IPCC to bring the rest of the chapter into compliance with this wording. The summary at the start of the accepted version of the chapter stated that &quot;these results indicate that the observed trend in global mean temperature over the past 100 years is unlikely to be entirely natural in origin. More importantly, there is evidence of an emerging pattern of climate response to forcings by greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols in the observed climate record. Taken together, these results point towards a human influence on global climate.&quot; The final paragraph in the chapter stated &quot;The body of statistical evidence in Chapter 8, when examined in the context of our physical understanding of the climate system, now points to a discernible human influence on global climate.&quot; An introductory preface to the SAR written by IPCC chairman Bolin and his co-chairs John T. Houghton and L. Gylvan Meira Filho highlighted &quot;that observations suggest &#x27;a discernible human influence on global climate&#x27;, one of the key findings of this report, adds an important new dimension to discussion of the climate issue.&quot;

Prior to the publication of the Second Assessment Report, the industry group Global Climate Coalition distributed a report entitled &quot;The IPCC: Institutionalized Scientific Cleansing&quot; to reporters, US Congressmen, and scientists, which said that Santer had altered the text, after acceptance by the Working Group, and without approval of the authors, to strike content characterizing the uncertainty of the science. Three weeks later, and a week after the Second Assessment Report was released, the Global Climate Coalition was echoed in a letter published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; from the retired condensed matter physicist and former president of the US National Academy of Sciences, Frederick Seitz, chair of the George C. Marshall Institute and Science and Environmental Policy Project, but not a climatologist. In this letter, Seitz alleged that Santer had perpetrated &quot;a disturbing corruption of the peer-review process.&quot; Seitz criticized the conclusions of Chapter 8, and wrote that &quot;key changes were made after the scientists had met and accepted what they thought was the final peer-reviewed version&quot;, deleting &quot;hints of the skepticism&quot; he attributed to other unnamed scientists.

The position of the lead author of Chapter 8, Benjamin D. Santer, was supported by fellow IPCC authors and senior figures of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). The presidents of the AMS and UCAR stated that there was a &quot;systematic effort by some individuals to undermine and discredit the scientific process that has led many scientists working on understanding climate to conclude that there is a very real possibility that humans are modifying Earth&#x27;s climate on a global scale.&quot;

Other rebuttals of Seitz&#x27;s comments include a 1997 paper by Paul Edwards and IPCC author Stephen Schneider, and a 2007 complaint to the UK broadcast regulator Ofcom about the television programme, &quot;The Great Global Warming Swindle&quot;. The 2007 complaint includes a rebuttal of Seitz&#x27;s claims by the former IPCC chairman, Bert Bolin.

== Debate over value of a statistical life ==
One of the controversies of the Second Assessment Working Group III report is the economic valuation of human life, which is used in monetized (i.e., converted into US dollar values) estimates of climate change impacts. Often in these monetized estimates, the health risks of climate change are valued so that they are &quot;consistent&quot; with valuations of other health risks. There are a wide range of views on monetized estimates of climate change impacts. The strengths and weaknesses of monetized estimates are discussed in the SAR and later IPCC assessments.

In the preparation of the SAR, disagreement arose over the Working Group III Summary for Policymakers (SPM). The SPM is written by a group of IPCC authors, who then discuss the draft with government delegates from all of the UNFCCC Parties (i.e., delegates from most of the world&#x27;s governments). The economic valuation of human life (referred to by economists as the &quot;value of statistical life&quot;) was viewed by some governments (such as India) as suggesting that people living in poor countries are worth less than people living in rich countries. David Pearce, who was a lead author of the relevant chapter of the SAR, officially dissented on the SPM. According to Pearce:
The relevant chapter [of the Report] values of statistical life based on actual studies in different countries ... What the authors of Chapter 6 did not accept, and still do not accept, was the call from a few [government] delegates for a common valuation based on the highest number for willingness to pay.

In other words, a few government delegates wanted &quot;statistical lives&quot; in poor countries to be valued at the same level as &quot;statistical lives&quot; in rich countries. IPCC author Michael Grubb later commented:
Many of us think that the governments were basically right. The metric [used by Pearce] makes sense for determining how a given government might make tradeoffs between its own internal projects. But the same logic fails when the issue is one of damage inflicted by some countries on others: why should the deaths inflicted by the big emitters—principally the industrialised countries—be valued differently according to the wealth of the victims&#x27; countries?

<doc id="1263428" wikidata="Q7715485" url="?curid=1263428" title="The Baltimore Consort">
<text>The Baltimore Consort is a musical ensemble that performs a wide variety of early music, Renaissance music and music from later periods. They began in 1980 as a group specializing in music of the Elizabethan period, but soon expanded their repertoire to include Scottish music, broadside ballads, and Italian, French, and other European music of the 16th and 17th centuries. Their music bridges the genres of classical and folk music.

==History==
The Baltimore Consort was founded by Roger Harmon and Mindy Rosenfeld in 1980. Harmon formerly had taught lute at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland. They performed together for ten years before releasing their first album for Dorian Recordings, a collection of Scottish music called &quot;On the Banks of Helicon&quot;. By the time of that recording the ensemble consisted of Custer LaRue (soprano), Ronn McFarlane (lute), Mary Anne Ballard (viols, fiddle), Larry Lipkis (bass viol, recorder), Chris Norman (flutes, bagpipes, bodhran), Howard Bass (bandora), and Mark Cudek (cittern, bass viol). Norman was replaced in 2003 by Mindy Rosenfeld, founding member of the original 1980 group whom he had replaced in 1987, and LaRue began an indefinite leave of absence in 2004, at which time countertenor José Lemos began performing with the group, joined in 2005 by soprano Danielle Svonavec. 

The group has recorded some 15 albums for Dorian, including a Christmas album, &quot;Bright Day Star&quot;, and a collection of bawdy songs with the &quot;a capella&quot; quartet called the Merry Companions, &quot;The Art of the Bawdy Song&quot; and a 2007 instrumental compilation, &quot;Gut, Wind and Wire&quot;. Their various recordings also cover a number of the Child ballads.

<text>This is a list of heritage NATO country codes. Up to and including the seventh edition of STANAG 1059, these were two-letter codes (digrams). The eighth edition, promulgated 19 February 2004, and effective 1 April 2004, replaced all codes with new ones based on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes. Additional codes cover gaps in the ISO coverage, deal with imaginary countries used for exercise purposes, and designate large geographical groupings and water bodies (ranging from oceans to rivers). It consists of two-letter codes for geographical entities, four-letter codes for subdivisions, and lists the ISO three-letter codes for reference. The digrams match the FIPS 10-4 codes with a few exceptions.

The ninth edition&#x27;s ratification draft was published on 6 July 2005, with a reply deadline of 6 October 2005. It replaces all two- and four-letter codes with ISO or ISO-like three- and six-letter codes. It is intended as a transitional standard: once all NATO nations have updated their information systems, a tenth edition will be published.

For diplomatic reasons, the country that is now known as North Macedonia was designated as the &quot;Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot; for a number of years and received a temporary code, FY/FYR, explicitly different from the ISO one, which was 3166 MKD. Since its name change following the 2018 Prespa agreement with Greece, the country is identified with the MK digram and the MKD trigram, but on car license plates, they must be changed to NM or NMK.

The Republic of Palau is also often indicated (at least in the United States) as PW.

<doc id="1263431" wikidata="Q94712" url="?curid=1263431" title="Crawler-transporter">
<text>The crawler-transporters, formally known as the Missile Crawler Transporter Facilities, are a pair of tracked vehicles used to transport launch vehicles from NASA&#x27;s Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) along the Crawlerway to Launch Complex 39. They were originally used to transport the Saturn IB and Saturn V rockets during the Apollo, Skylab and Apollo–Soyuz programs. They were then used to transport Space Shuttles from 1981 to 2011. The crawler-transporters carry vehicles on the mobile launcher platforms (MLPs) used by NASA, and after each launch return to the pad to take the platform back to the VAB.

The two crawler-transporters were designed and built by Marion Power Shovel Company using some components designed and built by Rockwell International at a cost of ( in 2022) each. Upon its construction, the crawler-transporter became the largest self-powered land vehicle in the world until it was beaten in 2013 with the production of the ultraheavy XGC88000 crawler crane. While other vehicles such as bucket-wheel excavators like Bagger 288, dragline excavators like Big Muskie and power shovels like The Captain are significantly larger, they are powered by external sources.

The two crawler-transporters were added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 21, 2000.

==Specifications==
The crawler-transporter has a mass of and has eight tracks, two on each corner. Each track has 57 shoes, and each shoe weighs . The vehicle measures . The height from ground level to the platform is adjustable from , and each side can be raised and lowered independently of the other. The crawler uses a laser guidance system and a leveling system to keep the Mobile Launcher Platform level within 10 minutes of arc (0.16 degrees; about at the top of the Saturn V), while moving up the 5 percent grade to the launch site. A separate laser docking system provides pinpoint accuracy when the crawler-transporter and Mobile Launch Platform are positioned in the VAB or at the launch pad. A team of nearly 30 engineers, technicians and drivers operate the vehicle, centered on an internal control room, and the crawler is driven from two control cabs located at either end. Before the launch the crawler-transporter is removed.

The crawlers were overhauled in 2003 with upgrades to the Motor Control Center, which houses the switchgear and electrical controls of all of major systems on board; a new engine and pump ventilation system; new diesel engine radiators; and replacement of the two driver cabs on each vehicle (one on each end). As of 2003, each crawler had 16 traction motors, powered by four generators, in turn driven by two V16 ALCO 251C diesel engines. Two generators, driven by two engines, were used for jacking, steering, lighting, and ventilating. Two generators were also available to power the Mobile Launcher Platform. The crawler&#x27;s tanks held of diesel fuel, and it burned . Due to their age and the need to support the heavier Space Launch System and its launch tower, in 2012–2014 the crawlers were undergoing an upgrade involving &quot;new engines, new exhausts, new brakes, new hydraulics, new computers&quot;; CT-2 was further upgraded in 2014–2016 to increase its lifting capacity from .

The crawlers traveled along the Crawlerways, to LC-39A and LC-39B, respectively, at a maximum speed of loaded, or unloaded. The average trip time from the VAB along the Crawlerway to Launch Complex 39 is about five hours. Each Crawlerway is deep and covered with Alabama and Tennessee river rock for its low friction properties to reduce the possibility of sparks. In 2000, NASA unearthed and restored an Apollo-era segment of the Crawlerway to provide access to High Bay 2 in the VAB in order to provide protection from a hurricane for up to three Shuttles at the same time.

Kennedy Space Center has been using the same two crawlers since their initial delivery in 1965. They are now nicknamed &quot;Hans and Franz&quot;, after the parodic Austrian body-builder characters on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, played by Dana Carvey and Kevin Nealon. In their lifetime, they have traveled more than , about the same driving distance as from Miami to Seattle.

==Future use==
===Crawler-Transporter 2===
NASA currently uses crawler-transporter 2 to transport the Space Launch System with the Orion spacecraft atop it from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Pad 39B for the Artemis missions. Early in 2016, NASA finished upgrading crawler-transporter 2 (CT-2) to a &quot;Super Crawler&quot; for use in the Artemis program. NASA performed a rollout of the Artemis 1 Space Launch System and Orion on March 17, 2022 for the first Wet Dress Rehearsal, and the rollout for launch, which launched in November 2022. The rollout for the WDR, marked the first time one of the crawler transporters rolled a launch vehicle to the launch pad since STS-135.

===Crawler-Transporter 1===
NASA had originally planned for crawler-transporter 1 to be used by commercial launch vehicles. In April 2016, then Orbital ATK, now Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, and NASA entered negotiations for the lease of CT-1 and one of the four Vehicle Assembly Building bays. Northrop Grumman planned to use CT-1 to transport their OmegA from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Pad 39B. OmegA was cancelled in September of 2020 after Northrop Grumman lost the National Security Space Launch contract to United Launch Alliance and SpaceX.

==Appearances in popular culture==
The crawler-transporters have featured in television and movies. In a 2007 season three episode of &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot;, host Mike Rowe helps workers maintain a crawler-transporter and takes the vehicle for a short drive. The crawler was also seen in the 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, the 2011 film &quot;&quot; and the 2019 film &quot;Apollo 11&quot;. Similar vehicles also appeared in the 2013 film &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;.

In the 2009 &quot;Fallout 3&quot; video game add-on pack &quot;Broken Steel&quot;, the US government survivors, The Enclave, have a mobile base built on and into a heavily modified crawler. In &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot;, various units are called &quot;crawlers&quot; and feature chassis based on the crawler-transporters. In &quot;Asphalt 8: Airborne&quot;, three crawler-transporters drive over the space center French Guiana track.

<doc id="1263436" wikidata="Q24962698" url="?curid=1263436" title="Hatzi">
<text>Hatzi- or Chatzi- () is a prefix of Greek family names. It derives from the Turkish word &#x27;Hacı&#x27; which ultimately derives from the Arabic &quot;Hajji&quot;, a name for someone who has successfully completed a pilgrimage.

In Orthodox Christianity, the prefix is added when someone had committed the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. For example, if the name was Giannis, the name would then be Hatzigiannis after the journey. 

In Islam, the prefix is added before the name. For example, Ibrahim Kaya would become Hajji Ibrahim Kaya.

<doc id="1263447" wikidata="Q6601404" url="?curid=1263447" title="List of Ulysses characters">
<text>This is a list of characters from &quot;[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]&quot; by James Joyce.

==Principal characters==
* Leopold Bloom is a protagonist and hero in Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. His peregrinations and encounters in Dublin on 16 June 1904 mirror, on a more mundane and intimate scale, those of Ulysses/Odysseus in Homer&#x27;s epic poem the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The character was inspired by James Joyce&#x27;s close friend, Aron Ettore Schmitz (Italo Svevo), author of &quot;Zeno&#x27;s Conscience&quot;.
* Molly Bloom, the wife of main character Leopold Bloom, she roughly corresponds to Penelope in the Odyssey. The major difference between Molly and Penelope is that while Penelope is eternally faithful, Molly is not.
* Stephen Dedalus is James Joyce&#x27;s literary alter ego, appearing as the protagonist and antihero of his first, semi-autobiographical novel of artistic existence &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; and an important character in Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Stephen Dedalus appears in &quot;Ulysses&quot; as the character who corresponds to Telemachus; less overtly, he embodies aspects of Hamlet. He is the protagonist of the first three chapters. Subsequently, Leopold Bloom is introduced, and Stephen&#x27;s interactions with Bloom and his wife, Molly, form much of the final chapters&#x27; substance.

==Other characters==
* Almidano Artifoni, an opera singer.
* Mrs. Yelverton Barry has been described as &quot;one of the fantasized sadistic women of &#x27;Circe who accuse Bloom in the courtroom scene of having made sexual advances—in her case, of writing to her claiming to have observed her &quot;peerless globes&quot; in the Theatre Royal, and offered to send her a work of fiction by a Monsieur Paul de Kock. She also features as a character in the play, &quot;Ulysses in Nighttown&quot;.
* Mrs. Bellingham is one of the fantasized sadistic women of the &quot;Circe&quot; chapter who accuse Bloom in the courtroom scene of having made sexual advances—in her case, of sending her a letter asking her to &quot;commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity&quot;. She also features as a character in the play, &quot;Ulysses in Nighttown&quot;, and was played by Bernadette McKenna and Maire Ni Ghrainne at the Abbey Theatre.
* Richard Best is a character based on Celtic scholar Richard Irvine Best. Best was an acquaintance of J. M. Synge and Joyce. Best was depicted as one of the characters in the National Library scene in Episode 9 &quot;Scylla and Charybdis&quot;. Best was known to have disapproved of Joyce&#x27;s characterisation of him.
* Milly Bloom is Molly and Leopold&#x27;s fifteen-year-old daughter, who does not actually appear in &quot;Ulysses&quot; other than through verbal recollections and letters. The Blooms send Milly to live in Mullingar and learn photography. She is dating Alec Bannon in Mullingar.
* Edy Boardman – a prostitute.
* Blazes Boylan is the manager for Molly Bloom&#x27;s upcoming concert in Belfast. Boylan is well known and well liked around town, but comes across as a rather sleazy individual, especially regarding his attitudes toward women. Boylan has become interested in Molly, and they have an affair during the novel.
* Josie Breen is a former love interest of Leopold. He encounters her in Dublin, and then later in the &quot;Nighttown&quot; sequence where Bloom re-lives his affection for her. Josie&#x27;s husband Denis is something of a laughingstock and is in poor mental health.
* Denis Breen is the husband of Josie Breen and is a figure of fun. A person unknown sent him a postcard with &quot;U.p: up&quot; written on it and he seeks to take a libel action for ten thousand pounds. Leopold states that Josie&#x27;s marriage to Denis was a case of &quot;beauty and the beast&quot;.
* Cissy, Jacky, and Tommy Caffrey: Cissy Caffrey is a friend of Gerty MacDowell and encounters Bloom on Sandymount Strand. She appears again in the &quot;Nighttown&quot; sequence, apparently as a lady of the night. Jacky and Tommy are her two younger brothers who she is minding at Sandymount.
* Nurse Callan is a nurse at the National Maternity Hospital. She is described as a &quot;virgin&quot; and attends to a local woman, Mina Purefoy. She is described as brushing a Dr. O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s coat attentively.
* Private Carr – a British soldier.
* The Citizen is an old Irish nationalist with xenophobic and anti-semitic views who engages in an argument with Leopold in Barney Kiernan&#x27;s pub, ultimately throwing a biscuit tin at him. &quot;The Citizen&quot; is an important figure in the &quot;Cyclops&quot; episode of the novel. The character has been described as having characteristics not only of the mythological Cyclops but also of the Irish epic figure Finn McCool. &quot;The Citizen&quot; is, in part, a satirical portrait of Irish nationalist (and Gaelic Athletic Association founder) Michael Cusack and Joyce&#x27;s portrayal operates to expose what one critic called the &quot;xenophobic ideologies of radical Celticists&quot;.
* Martha Clifford is a correspondent with Leopold Bloom, who according to some scholars is a pseudonymous identity for over a half a dozen other characters.
* Bella Cohen is the brothel-mistress in the &quot;Nighttown&quot; sequence, and has a large and mannish appearance. She has a son in an Oxford college.
* Private Compton is a British soldier who wanders around Nighttown with Private Carr, eventually encountering Stephen Dedalus. At Compton&#x27;s urging, Carr eventually assaults Dedalus.
* Father John Conmee, a Jesuit priest.
* Punch Costello is a medical student who we first encounter singing a bawdy song in the National Maternity Hospital. He is told by nurse Quigley to be quiet. He later appears as &quot;Dr&quot; Punch Costello in the medical examination of Leopold Bloom and pronounces, anti-Semitically, that the &quot;fetor judaicus&quot; is palpable from Bloom.
* Myles Crawford is the Editor of the Evening Telegraph, and refuses to honour an agreement entered into with Leopold Bloom and Alexander Keyes regarding an advertisement for the &quot;House of Keyes&quot;.
* Martin Cunningham is a friend of Leopold and accompanies him in the carriage to Paddy Dignam&#x27;s funeral and thereafter to Kiernan&#x27;s pub. There he kindly facilitates Bloom&#x27;s escape from the Citizen, and to visit Dignam&#x27;s widow.
* Garrett Deasy is the headmaster in the school where Stephen Dedalus teaches and is pompous and opinionated. He writes a self-important letter to the evening newspaper which Dedalus helps get published, on the subject of foot-and-mouth disease.
* Dilly, Katey, Boody, and Maggy Dedalus are sisters of Stephen Dedalus.
* May Golding Dedalus is the mother of Stephen Dedalus. Stephen, a non-believer, refuses to pray at her deathbed and in consequence, thoughts of May haunt him later in the novel. She states, &quot;I was once the beautiful May Golding&quot; (her maiden name). In the 1967 film of Ulysses, the American director Americanizes this as &quot;May Golding Dedalus&quot;, an anachronism which does not appear in the book, where European conventions are observed.
* Simon Dedalus is the father of Stephen Dedalus. His character is largely based on Joyce&#x27;s own father, John Stanislaus Joyce. Simon is a passionate Irish nationalist and supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell, facilitating his financial success within Dublin society in Stephens&#x27; earlier years. But with the political &quot;fall from grace&quot; of Parnell, he and his family also fall on hard times. Simon has lost his wife but has continued to maintain an air of respectability within Dublin&#x27;s &quot;drinking society&quot; where he is known for his wit and singing ability but is unable to provide support for his two daughters. His and Stephen&#x27;s paths cross several times during the course of the book but the two never meet. Simon briefly mentions concern for Stephen, who is now living on his own and supporting himself, but Stephen feels only the need to escape what remains of his disintegrating family. The novel presents Bloom as Stephen&#x27;s metaphoric and symbolic father.
* Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Dignam – Leopold Bloom attends his funeral from the family home to Glasnevin Cemetery in the chapter &quot;Hades&quot;. He is survived by Mrs. Dignam and their son Patrick Aloysius &quot;Patsy&quot; Dignam. The Dignams live at number 9, Newbridge Avenue, Sandymount. As he dies in a drunken stupor, he is considered Joyce&#x27;s analog of Elpenor, who died in similar circumstances and who greeted his friend Odysseus.
* Mrs. Dignam, and Patrick Dignam, Jr.
* Dr. Dixon
* Ben Dollard
* Bob Doran is a drunk in Kiernan&#x27;s pub and together with The Citizen creates an unpleasant atmosphere for Leopold Bloom ultimately resulting in The Citizen throwing a biscuit tin at Bloom. Doran is one of the main characters in “The Boarding House” in &quot;Dubliners,&quot; where he is apparently conned into marrying the daughter of the boarding house owner.
* Mary Driscoll is a maid who was fired by Molly Bloom who was jealous of Leopold&#x27;s interest in her. She appears in both Leopold and Molly&#x27;s streams of consciousness later in the novel.
* Miss Dunne is Blazes Boylan&#x27;s secretary
* John Eglinton
* Lieutenant Gardner is a British soldier and a former lover of Molly Bloom and in her soliloquy at the end of the novel, Molly recalls fondling him &quot;to keep him from doing worse&quot;. Gardner, who served in the 8th Battalion of the 2nd East Lancashire Regiment, was killed in the Boer War.
* Richie, Sara (Sally), and Walter Goulding
* Haines is an English student who comes to visit Buck Mulligan and Stephen Dedalus in the Martello Tower in Sandymount. Haines is somewhat anti-semitic in attitude and is in Ireland to study Irish culture.
* Zoe Higgins is a namesake of Leopold&#x27;s mother and is a worker in Bella Cohen&#x27;s brothel. She plays an important role in the &quot;Nighttown&quot; sequence of the novel. She is the first to lure Bloom into the brothel and later steals his potato and dances with Stephen Dedalus.
* John Hooper was an Irish nationalist, journalist, politician and MP in the House of Commons. As a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party he represented South-East Cork from 1885 to 1889. He is mentioned when a matrimonial gift of a stuffed owl given by &quot;alderman Hooper&quot; is described along with a number of items sitting on a mantelpiece.
* Joe Hynes
* Corny Kelleher – an undertaker&#x27;s employee who rejects Leopold&#x27;s request for assistance for Stephen Dedalus who was injured in a fight with Private Carr.
* Mina Kennedy and Lydia Douce
* Barney Kiernan is the owner of a public house where Leopold Bloom comes to meet Martin Cunningham, and where he has an altercation with the anti-Semitic character, The Citizen.
* Ned Lambert a friend of Simon Dedalus from Cork. He attends the funeral in &quot;Hades&quot; and appears in the news paper offices in &quot;Aeolus&quot; and later in St. Mary&#x27;s Abbey in &quot;Wandering Rocks&quot; and the pub in &quot;Cyclops&quot;.
* Lenehan a bowsie (lowlife) and freelance journalist who appears in the &quot;Aeolus&quot;, &quot;The Wandering Rocks&quot; &quot;Sirens&quot;, &quot;Cyclops&quot;, &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; and &quot;Circe&quot; episodes and is a central character in Two Gallants chapter of Dubliners.
* Vincent Lynch is a somewhat treacherous friend of Stephen Dedalus, who is present in the National Maternity Hospital in the &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; chapter. In &quot;Circe&quot;, he is impatient with Dedalus&#x27; drunkenness and abandons Dedalus after leaving Bella Cohen&#x27;s establishment, having helped spend Dedalus&#x27; money.
* Bantam Lyons is a Dubliner who misunderstands Leopold Bloom&#x27;s reference to throwing away a newspaper as being a tip for a horse called Throwaway. He later shares this tip with fellow gamblers.
* Thomas W. Lyster
* Gerty MacDowell is a woman in her early twenties with a limp, who lets Bloom see her undergarments on Sandymount Strand. She appears again in the &quot;Nighttown&quot; sequence as a lady of the night.
* Professor MacHugh an employee at the newspaper. According to Ellmann this is Hugh MacNeil a scholar who used to regularly visit the Evening Telegraph offices.
* Madden is introduced in the novel as a medical student, though he later appears as &quot;Dr.&quot; Madden in the medical examination of Leopold Bloom where he states that &quot;In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum&quot;.
* John Henry Menton based on the real John Henry Mentin, he is a practising solicitor and attends Paddy Dignam&#x27;s funeral. He is offhand with Leopold, presumably because of his former love interest in Molly Bloom. Denis Breen attends upon him for advice on a proposed libel action.
* Buck Mulligan – appears most prominently in episode 1 &quot;(Telemachus)&quot;, and is the subject of the novel&#x27;s famous first sentence: &quot;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.&quot;
* City Councillor Nannetti
* J. J. O’Molloy local lawyer that is deemed to be having money troubles.
* Jack Power travels with Leopold Bloom to Paddy Dignam&#x27;s funeral, and gauchely discusses suicide, unaware that Bloom&#x27;s father has killed himself. He is later present in Barney Kiernan&#x27;s pub for an altercation between Bloom and The Citizen.
* Kitty Ricketts – a worker in Bella Cohen&#x27;s brothel. and is a lover of another character, Lynch, being almost caught in the bushes with him by Father Conmee. She is thin in appearance and dresses with upwardly mobile aspirations.
* George William Russell (A.E.) who wrote with the pseudonym Æ (sometimes written AE or A.E.), was an Irish writer, editor, critic, poet, artistic painter and Irish nationalist. His first book of poems, &quot;Homeward: Songs by the Way&quot; (1894), established him in what was known as the Irish Literary Revival, where Æ met the young James Joyce in 1902 and introduced him to other Irish literary figures, including William Butler Yeats. He appears as a character in the &quot;Scylla and Charybdis&quot; episode, where he dismisses Stephen&#x27;s theories on Shakespeare. His collected poems was published in 1913, with a second edition in 1926.
* Cyril Sargent is a pupil of Stephen Dedalus and is an uncertain and mediocre student, reminding Dedalus of his own childhood and uncertainties.
* Florry Talbot is a worker in Bella Cohen&#x27;s brothel. She plays an important role in the &quot;Nighttown&quot; sequence of the novel and is an overweight presence in the premises. She is concerned about the possible end of the world.
* Mrs. Mervyn Talboys is one of the fantasized sadistic women of &quot;Circe&quot; who accuse Bloom in the courtroom scene of having made sexual advances—in her case, of sending her an obscene postcard and urging her to soil the correspondence &quot;in an unspeakable manner&quot;. Talboys announces that she will horsewhip Bloom: &quot;To dare address me! I&#x27;ll flog him black and blue in the public streets&quot;. She also features as a character in the play, Ulysses in Nighttown, having been played by Kathleen Barrington and Maire O&#x27;Neill at the Abbey Theatre.

<text>A provincial superior is an officer of a religious institute (including religious orders) acting under the institute&#x27;s Superior General. A provincial superior exercises general supervision over all the members of that institute in a territorial division of the order called a &quot;province&quot;, which is similar to, but not to be confused with, an ecclesiastical province. Instead, the province under a provincial superior is one made up of particular churches or dioceses under the supervision of a Metropolitan Bishop. The division of a religious institute into provinces is generally along geographical lines and may consist of one or more countries, or of only a part of a country. There may be, however, one or more houses of one province situated within the physical territory of another since the jurisdiction over the individual religious is personal, rather than territorial. The title of the office is often abbreviated to Provincial.

Among the friars and Third Order Religious Sisters of the Augustinian, Carmelite and Dominican orders, the title or [[Prioress]] Provincial is generally used. The Friars Minor, in contrast, use the title in line with their emphasis on living as brothers to one another.

==History==
The old orders had no provincial superiors; even when the monasteries were united to form congregations, the arch-abbot of each congregation was in the position of a superior general whose powers were limited to particular cases, almost like the powers of a metropolitan archbishop over the dioceses of his suffragans. Provincial superiors are found in the institutes of more recent formation, which began with the mendicant orders. The Holy See hesitated for a long time before allowing the division of congregations with simple vows, especially congregations of women, into different provinces as a regular institution, and some congregations have no such division. 

The provincial superior is ordinarily elected by the Provincial Chapter, subject to confirmation by the Superior General or the General Chapter, depending on the regulations of the particular groups (in the Society of Jesus he is directly appointed by the Father General). The &quot;Regulations&quot; (Normae) of 18 June 1901, vest the appointment of the provincial in the general council. The provincial superior is never elected for life, but ordinarily for three or six years. In religious orders with clerics, he is a regular prelate, and has the rank of ordinary with quasi-episcopal jurisdiction. In religious institutes whether of men or of women, the provincial superior appoints the regular confessors, calls together the Provincial Chapter, presides over its deliberations, and takes care that the orders of the General Chapter and the Superior General are properly carried out. The provincial superior is an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the chapter. The principal duty of the provincial superior is to make regular visitations of the houses of the province in the name of the General and to report to the latter on all the religious and the property of the order; authority over the various houses and local superiors differs in different orders. The provincial superior has, in many cases, the right of appointment to the less important offices. For institutes of men, at the end of his
term of office, the provincial is bound, according to the Constitution &quot;Nuper&quot; of Innocent XII (23 December 1697), to prove that he has complied with all the precepts of that decree concerning Masses; if he fails to do so, he loses his right to be elected and to vote in the general chapter.

==Politics==
A unique case was eastern Paraguay, where the Spanish colonial authorities allowed the Jesuit missionaries to establish both the Catholic faith and a unique, humane regime for the local Guarani Indian tribes, making their provincial superior the governor of the first autonomous Indian reserve, known as the (Jesuit) Misiones or Reducciones, until 1667, ten years after a Guarani rebellion against increased abuse by the regular colonial authorities: the territory lost its status and was divided up between Spain (then under the viceroyalty of la Plata, previously part of Upper Peru) and Portugal (Brazil).

<doc id="1263455" wikidata="Q323481" url="?curid=1263455" title="Programme for International Student Assessment">
<text>The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a worldwide study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in member and non-member nations intended to evaluate educational systems by measuring 15-year-old school pupils&#x27; scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading. It was first performed in 2000 and then repeated every three years. Its aim is to provide comparable data with a view to enabling countries to improve their education policies and outcomes. It measures problem solving and cognition.

The results of the 2022 data collection were released in December 2023.

==Influence and impact==
PISA, and similar international standardised assessments of educational attainment are increasingly used in the process of education policymaking at both national and international levels.

PISA was conceived to set in a wider context the information provided by national monitoring of education system performance through regular assessments within a common, internationally agreed framework; by investigating relationships between student learning and other factors they can &quot;offer insights into sources of variation in performances within and between countries&quot;.

Until the 1990s, few European countries used national tests. In the 1990s, ten countries / regions introduced standardised assessment, and since the early 2000s, ten more followed suit. By 2009, only five European education systems had no national student assessments.

The impact of these international standardised assessments in the field of educational policy has been significant, in terms of the creation of &quot;new knowledge&quot;, changes in &quot;assessment policy&quot;, and &quot;external influence over national educational policy&quot; more broadly.

=== Creation of new knowledge ===
Data from international standardised assessments can be useful in research on causal factors within or across education systems. Mons notes that the databases generated by large-scale international assessments have made it possible to carry out inventories and comparisons of education systems on an unprecedented scale on themes ranging from the conditions for learning mathematics and reading, to institutional autonomy and admissions policies. They allow typologies to be developed that can be used for comparative statistical analyses of education performance indicators, thereby identifying the consequences of different policy choices. They have generated new knowledge about education: PISA findings have challenged deeply embedded educational practices, such as the early tracking of students into vocational or academic pathways.

Barroso and de Carvalho find that PISA provides a common reference connecting academic research in education and the political realm of public policy, operating as a mediator between different strands of knowledge from the realm of education and public policy. However, although the key findings from comparative assessments are widely shared in the research community the knowledge they create does not necessarily fit with government reform agendas; this leads to some inappropriate uses of assessment data.

===Changes in national assessment policy===
Emerging research suggests that international standardised assessments are having an impact on national assessment policy and practice. PISA is being integrated into national policies and practices on assessment, evaluation, curriculum standards and performance targets; its assessment frameworks and instruments are being used as best-practice models for improving national assessments; many countries have explicitly incorporated and emphasise PISA-like competencies in revised national standards and curricula; others use PISA data to complement national data and validate national results against an international benchmark.

===External influence over national educational policy===

PISA may influence national education policy choices in a variety of ways. Participation in international assessments like PISA has been linked to significant education policy changes and outcomes, such as higher student enrollments and education reforms. However, critics have argued that participation could lead to undesirable outcomes, such as higher repetition rates and narrowing of curricula. The impact of PISA may also vary according to the specific country context.

Policy-makers in most participating countries see PISA as an important indicator of system performance; PISA reports can define policy problems and set the agenda for national policy debate; policymakers seem to accept PISA as a valid and reliable instrument for internationally benchmarking system performance and changes over time; most countries—irrespective of whether they performed above, at, or below the average PISA score—have begun policy reforms in response to PISA reports.

Against this, impact on national education systems varies markedly. For example, in Germany, the results of the first PISA assessment caused the so-called &#x27;PISA shock&#x27;: a questioning of previously accepted educational policies; in a state marked by jealously guarded regional policy differences, it led ultimately to an agreement by all Länder to introduce common national standards and even an institutionalised structure to ensure that they were observed. In Hungary, by comparison, which shared similar conditions to Germany, PISA results have not led to significant changes in educational policy.

Because many countries have set national performance targets based on their relative rank or absolute PISA score, PISA assessments have increased the influence of their (non-elected) commissioning body, the OECD, as an international education monitor and policy actor, which implies an important degree of &#x27;policy transfer&#x27; from the international to the national level; PISA in particular is having &quot;an influential normative effect on the direction of national education policies&quot;. Thus, it is argued that the use of international standardised assessments has led to a shift towards international, external accountability for national system performance; Rey contends that PISA surveys, portrayed as objective, third-party diagnoses of education systems, actually serve to promote specific orientations on educational issues.

National policy actors refer to high-performing PISA countries to &quot;help legitimise and justify their intended reform agenda within contested national policy debates&quot;. PISA data can be &quot;used to fuel long-standing debates around pre-existing conflicts or rivalries between different policy options, such as in the French Community of Belgium&quot;. In such instances, PISA assessment data are used selectively: in public discourse governments often only use superficial features of PISA surveys such as country rankings and not the more detailed analyses. Rey (2010:145, citing Greger, 2008) notes that often the real results of PISA assessments are ignored as policymakers selectively refer to data in order to legitimise policies introduced for other reasons.

In addition, PISA&#x27;s international comparisons can be used to justify reforms with which the data themselves have no connection; in Portugal, for example, PISA data were used to justify new arrangements for teacher assessment (based on inferences that were not justified by the assessments and data themselves); they also fed the government&#x27;s discourse about the issue of pupils repeating a year, (which, according to research, fails to improve student results). In Finland, the country&#x27;s PISA results (that are in other countries deemed to be excellent) were used by Ministers to promote new policies for &#x27;gifted&#x27; students. Such uses and interpretations often assume causal relationships that cannot legitimately be based upon PISA data which would normally require fuller investigation through qualitative in-depth studies and longitudinal surveys based on mixed quantitative and qualitative methods, which politicians are often reluctant to fund.

Recent decades have witnessed an expansion in the uses of PISA and similar assessments, from assessing students&#x27; learning, to connecting &quot;the educational realm (their traditional remit) with the political realm&quot;. This raises the question of whether PISA data are sufficiently robust to bear the weight of the major policy decisions that are being based upon them, for, according to Breakspear, PISA data have &quot;come to increasingly shape, define and evaluate the key goals of the national / federal education system&quot;. This implies that those who set the PISA tests – e.g. in choosing the content to be assessed and not assessed – are in a position of considerable power to set the terms of the education debate, and to orient educational reform in many countries around the globe.

==Framework==
PISA stands in a tradition of international school studies, undertaken since the late 1950s by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). Much of PISA&#x27;s methodology follows the example of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS, started in 1995), which in turn was much influenced by the U.S. National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The reading component of PISA is inspired by the IEA&#x27;s Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).

PISA aims to test literacy of students in three competence fields: reading, mathematics, science on an indefinite scale.

The PISA mathematics literacy test asks students to apply their mathematical knowledge to solve problems set in real-world contexts. To solve the problems students must activate a number of mathematical competencies as well as a broad range of mathematical content knowledge. TIMSS, on the other hand, measures more traditional classroom content such as an understanding of fractions and decimals and the relationship between them (curriculum attainment). PISA claims to measure education&#x27;s application to real-life problems and lifelong learning (workforce knowledge).

In the reading test, &quot;OECD/PISA does not measure the extent to which 15-year-old students are fluent readers or how competent they are at word recognition tasks or spelling.&quot; Instead, they should be able to &quot;construct, extend and reflect on the meaning of what they have read across a wide range of continuous and non-continuous texts.&quot;

PISA also assesses students in innovative domains. In 2012 and 2015 in addition to reading, mathematics and science, they were tested in collaborative problem solving. In 2018 the additional innovative domain was global competence.

==Implementation==
PISA is sponsored, governed, and coordinated by the OECD, but paid for by participating countries.

==Method of testing==

===Sampling===
The students tested by PISA are aged between 15 years and 3 months and 16 years and 2 months at the beginning of the assessment period. The school year pupils are in is not taken into consideration. Only students at school are tested, not home-schoolers. In PISA 2006, however, several countries also used a grade-based sample of students. This made it possible to study how age and school year interact.

To fulfill OECD requirements, each country must draw a sample of at least 5,000 students. In small countries like Iceland and Luxembourg, where there are fewer than 5,000 students per year, an entire age cohort is tested. Some countries used much larger samples than required to allow comparisons between regions.

===Test===
Each student takes a two-hour computer based test. Part of the test is multiple-choice and part involves fuller answers. There are six and a half hours of assessment material, but each student is not tested on all the parts. Following the cognitive test, participating students spend nearly one more hour answering a questionnaire on their background including learning habits, motivation, and family. School directors fill in a questionnaire describing school demographics, funding, etc. In 2012 the participants were, for the first time in the history of large-scale testing and assessments, offered a new type of problem, i.e. interactive (complex) problems requiring exploration of a novel virtual device.

In selected countries, PISA started experimentation with computer adaptive testing.

===National add-ons===
Countries are allowed to combine PISA with complementary national tests.

Germany does this in a very extensive way: On the day following the international test, students take a national test called (E=Ergänzung=complement). Test items of PISA-E are closer to TIMSS than to PISA. While only about 5,000 German students participate in the international and the national test, another 45,000 take the national test only. This large sample is needed to allow an analysis by federal states. Following a clash about the interpretation of 2006 results, the OECD warned Germany that it might withdraw the right to use the &quot;PISA&quot; label for national tests.

===Data scaling===
From the beginning, PISA has been designed with one particular method of data analysis in mind. Since students work on different test booklets, raw scores must be &#x27;scaled&#x27; to allow meaningful comparisons. Scores are thus scaled so that the OECD average in each domain (mathematics, reading and science) is 500 and the standard deviation is 100. This is true only for the initial PISA cycle when the scale was first introduced, though, subsequent cycles are linked to the previous cycles through IRT scale linking methods.

This generation of proficiency estimates is done using a latent regression extension of the Rasch model, a model of item response theory (IRT), also known as conditioning model or population model. The proficiency estimates are provided in the form of so-called plausible values, which allow unbiased estimates of differences between groups. The latent regression, together with the use of a Gaussian prior probability distribution of student competencies allows estimation of the proficiency distributions of groups of participating students. The scaling and conditioning procedures are described in nearly identical terms in the Technical Reports of PISA 2000, 2003, 2006. NAEP and TIMSS use similar scaling methods.

==Ranking results==

All PISA results are tabulated by country; recent PISA cycles have separate provincial or regional results for some countries. Most public attention concentrates on just one outcome: the mean scores of countries and their rankings of countries against one another. In the official reports, however, country-by-country rankings are given not as simple league tables but as cross tables indicating for each pair of countries whether or not mean score differences are statistically significant (unlikely to be due to random fluctuations in student sampling or in item functioning). In favorable cases, a difference of 9 points is sufficient to be considered significant.

PISA never combines mathematics, science and reading domain scores into an overall score. However, commentators have sometimes combined test results from all three domains into an overall country ranking. Such meta-analysis is not endorsed by the OECD, although official summaries sometimes use scores from a testing cycle&#x27;s principal domain as a proxy for overall student ability.

===PISA 2022 ranking summary===
The results of PISA 2022 were presented on 5 December 2023, which included data for around 700,000 participating students in 81 countries and economies, with Singapore emerging as the top performer in all categories.

Both Lebanon and the Chinese provinces/municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang participated this edition, but their results were not published as they were not able to fully collect data because of COVID restrictions.

Because of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only 18 of 27 Ukrainian regions had their data collected, thus the results are not representative of the following regions: Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Donetsk Oblast, Kharkiv Oblast, Luhansk Oblast, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Kherson Oblast, Mykolaiv Oblast, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.

===Previous years===

==Reception==
===China===
China&#x27;s participation in the 2012 test was limited to Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macau as separate entities. In 2012, Shanghai participated for the second time, again topping the rankings in all three subjects, as well as improving scores in the subjects compared to the 2009 tests. Shanghai&#x27;s score of 613 in mathematics was 113 points above the average score, putting the performance of Shanghai pupils about 3 school years ahead of pupils in average countries. Educational experts debated to what degree this result reflected the quality of the general educational system in China, pointing out that Shanghai has greater wealth and better-paid teachers than the rest of China. Hong Kong placed second in reading and science and third in maths.

Andreas Schleicher, PISA division head and co-ordinator, stated that PISA tests administered in rural China have produced some results approaching the OECD average. Citing further as-yet-unpublished OECD research, he said, &quot;We have actually done Pisa in 12 of the provinces in China. Even in some of the very poor areas you get performance close to the OECD average.&quot; Schleicher believes that China has also expanded school access and has moved away from learning by rote, performing well in both rote-based and broader assessments.

In 2018 the Chinese provinces that participated were Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In 2015, the participating provinces were Jiangsu, Guangdong, Beijing, and Shanghai. The 2015 Beijing-Shanghai-Jiangsu-Guangdong cohort scored a median 518 in science in 2015, while the 2012 Shanghai cohort scored a median 580.

Critics of PISA counter that in Shanghai and other Chinese cities, most children of migrant workers can only attend city schools up to the ninth grade, and must return to their parents&#x27; hometowns for high school due to hukou restrictions, thus skewing the composition of the city&#x27;s high school students in favor of wealthier local families. A population chart of Shanghai reproduced in &quot;The New York Times&quot; shows a steep drop off in the number of 15-year-olds residing there. According to Schleicher, 27% of Shanghai&#x27;s 15-year-olds are excluded from its school system (and hence from testing). As a result, the percentage of Shanghai&#x27;s 15-year-olds tested by PISA was 73%, lower than the 89% tested in the US. Following the 2015 testing, OECD published in depth studies on the education systems of a selected few countries including China.

In 2014, Liz Truss, the British Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Education, led a fact-finding visit to schools and teacher-training centres in Shanghai. Britain increased exchanges with Chinese teachers and schools to find out how to improve quality. In 2014, 60 teachers from Shanghai were invited to the UK to help share their teaching methods, support pupils who are struggling, and help to train other teachers. In 2016, Britain invited 120 Chinese teachers, planning to adopt Chinese styles of teaching in 8,000 aided schools. By 2019, approximately 5,000 of Britain&#x27;s 16,000 primary schools had adopted the Shanghai&#x27;s teaching methods. The performance of British schools in PISA improved after adopting China&#x27;s teaching styles.

=== Finland ===
Finland, which received several top positions in the first tests, fell in all three subjects in 2012, but remained the best performing country overall in Europe, achieving their best result in science with 545 points (5th) and worst in mathematics with 519 (12th) in which the country was outperformed by four other European countries. The drop in mathematics was 25 points since 2003, the last time mathematics was the focus of the tests. For the first time Finnish girls outperformed boys in mathematics narrowly. It was also the first time pupils in Finnish-speaking schools did not perform better than pupils in Swedish-speaking schools. Former minister of Education and Science Krista Kiuru expressed concern for the overall drop, as well as the fact that the number of low-performers had increased from 7% to 12%.

=== India ===
India participated in the 2009 round of testing but pulled out of the 2012 PISA testing, with the Indian government attributing its action to the unfairness of PISA testing to Indian students. India had ranked 72nd out of 73 countries tested in 2009. The Indian Express reported, &quot;The ministry (of education) has concluded that there was a socio-cultural disconnect between the questions and Indian students. The ministry will write to the OECD and drive home the need to factor in India&#x27;s &quot;socio-cultural milieu&quot;. India&#x27;s participation in the next PISA cycle will hinge on this&quot;. The Indian Express also noted that &quot;Considering that over 70 nations participate in PISA, it is uncertain whether an exception would be made for India&quot;.

India did not participate in the 2012, 2015 and 2018 PISA rounds.

A Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) committee as well as a group of secretaries on education constituted by the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi recommended that India should participate in PISA. Accordingly, in February 2017, the Ministry of Human Resource Development under Prakash Javadekar decided to end the boycott and participate in PISA from 2020. To address the socio-cultural disconnect between the test questions and students, it was reported that the OECD will update some questions. For example, the word avocado in a question may be replaced with a more popular Indian fruit such as mango.

India did not participate in the 2022 PISA rounds citing due to COVID-19 pandemic disruption.

===Malaysia===
In 2015, the results from Malaysia were found by the OECD to have not met the maximum response rate. Opposition politician Ong Kian Ming said the education ministry tried to oversample high-performing students in rich schools.

=== Sweden ===
Sweden&#x27;s result dropped in all three subjects in the 2012 test, which was a continuation of a trend from 2006 and 2009. It saw the sharpest fall in mathematics performance with a drop in score from 509 in 2003 to 478 in 2012. The score in reading showed a drop from 516 in 2000 to 483 in 2012. The country performed below the OECD average in all three subjects. The leader of the opposition, Social Democrat Stefan Löfven, described the situation as a national crisis. Along with the party&#x27;s spokesperson on education, Ibrahim Baylan, he pointed to the downward trend in reading as most severe.

In 2020, Swedish newspaper Expressen revealed that Sweden had inflated their score in PISA 2018 by not conforming to OECD standards. According to professor Magnus Henrekson a large number of foreign-born students had not been tested.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the 2012 test, as in 2009, the result was slightly above average for the United Kingdom, with the science ranking being highest (20). England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland also participated as separated entities, showing the worst result for Wales which in mathematics was 43rd of the 65 countries and economies. Minister of Education in Wales Huw Lewis expressed disappointment in the results, said that there were no &quot;quick fixes&quot;, but hoped that several educational reforms that have been implemented in the last few years would give better results in the next round of tests. The United Kingdom had a greater gap between high- and low-scoring students than the average. There was little difference between public and private schools when adjusted for socio-economic background of students. The gender difference in favour of girls was less than in most other countries, as was the difference between natives and immigrants.

Writing in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard warned against putting too much emphasis on the UK&#x27;s international ranking, arguing that an overfocus on scholarly performances in East Asia might have contributed to the area&#x27;s low birthrate, which he argued could harm the economic performance in the future more than a good PISA score would outweigh.

In 2013, the &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot; (TES) published an article, &quot;Is PISA Fundamentally Flawed?&quot; by William Stewart, detailing serious critiques of PISA&#x27;s conceptual foundations and methods advanced by statisticians at major universities.

In the article, Professor Harvey Goldstein of the University of Bristol was quoted as saying that when the OECD tries to rule out questions suspected of bias, it can have the effect of &quot;smoothing out&quot; key differences between countries. &quot;That is leaving out many of the important things,&quot; he warned. &quot;They simply don&#x27;t get commented on. What you are looking at is something that happens to be common. But (is it) worth looking at? PISA results are taken at face value as providing some sort of common standard across countries. But as soon as you begin to unpick it, I think that all falls apart.&quot;

Queen&#x27;s University Belfast mathematician Dr. Hugh Morrison stated that he found the statistical model underlying PISA to contain a fundamental, insoluble mathematical error that renders Pisa rankings &quot;valueless&quot;. Goldstein remarked that Dr. Morrison&#x27;s objection highlights &quot;an important technical issue&quot; if not a &quot;profound conceptual error&quot;. However, Goldstein cautioned that PISA has been &quot;used inappropriately&quot;, contending that some of the blame for this &quot;lies with PISA itself. I think it tends to say too much for what it can do and it tends not to publicise the negative or the weaker aspects.&quot; Professors Morrison and Goldstein expressed dismay at the OECD&#x27;s response to criticism. Morrison said that when he first published his criticisms of PISA in 2004 and also personally queried several of the OECD&#x27;s &quot;senior people&quot; about them, his points were met with &quot;absolute silence&quot; and have yet to be addressed. &quot;I was amazed at how unforthcoming they were,&quot; he told TES. &quot;That makes me suspicious.&quot; &quot;Pisa steadfastly ignored many of these issues,&quot; he says. &quot;I am still concerned.&quot;

Professor Svend Kreiner, of the University of Copenhagen, agreed: &quot;One of the problems that everybody has with PISA is that they don&#x27;t want to discuss things with people criticising or asking questions concerning the results. They didn&#x27;t want to talk to me at all. I am sure it is because they can&#x27;t defend themselves.

===United States===

Since 2012 a few states have participated in the PISA tests as separate entities. Only the 2012 and 2015 results are available on a state basis. Puerto Rico participated in 2015 as a separate US entity as well.

==Research on possible causes of PISA disparities in different countries==
Although PISA and TIMSS officials and researchers themselves generally refrain from hypothesizing about the large and stable differences in student achievement between countries, since 2000, literature on the differences in PISA and TIMSS results and their possible causes has emerged. Data from PISA have furnished several researchers, notably Eric Hanushek, Ludger Wößmann, Heiner Rindermann, and Stephen J. Ceci, with material for books and articles about the relationship between student achievement and economic development, democratization, and health; as well as the roles of such single educational factors as high-stakes exams, the presence or absence of private schools and the effects and timing of ability tracking.

==Comments on accuracy==
David Spiegelhalter of Cambridge wrote: &quot;Pisa does present the uncertainty in the scores and ranks - for example the United Kingdom rank in the 65 countries is said to be between 23 and 31. It&#x27;s unwise for countries to base education policy on their Pisa results, as Germany, Norway and Denmark did after doing badly in 2001.&quot;

According to a Forbes opinion article, some countries such as China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Argentina select PISA samples from only the best-educated areas or from their top-performing students, slanting the results.

According to an open letter to Andreas Schleicher, director of PISA, various academics and educators argued that &quot;OECD and Pisa tests are damaging education worldwide&quot;.

According to &quot;O Estado de São Paulo&quot;, Brazil shows a great disparity when classifying the results between public and private schools, where public schools would rank worse than Peru, while private schools would rank better than Finland.

<doc id="1263456" wikidata="Q4780423" url="?curid=1263456" title="ApologetiX">
<text>ApologetiX is an American Christian parody band from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The band was founded in 1990, and since then, has played in almost all 50 states, and as of 2024 has released 75 studio albums, and built up a fan club that includes over 65,000 people. The band is currently composed of J. Jackson on vocals, Keith Haynie on bass guitar, Jimmy &quot;Vegas&quot; Tanner on drums, Bill Hubauer and Chris VonBartheld on keyboard, and Tom Milnes and Tom Tincha (a.k.a. &quot;TNT&quot;), both on lead guitar.

The name ApologetiX is a play on &quot;apologetics&quot;, the defense of a religious doctrine, in particular, Christian apologetics. The word is used in 1 Peter 3:15: &quot;But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer [defense or &quot;apologia&quot;] to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect...&quot; (NIV).

==History==
ApologetiX has had six official drummers. Jeff Pakula (June 1990 – September 1993), Rick Servocky (November 1993 – April 1995), Bob Flaherty (May 1995 – September 1998), Fred Behanna (February 1999 – January 2001), Bill &quot;Moose&quot; Rieger (March 2001 – January 2005) and Jimmy &quot;Vegas&quot; Tanner (October 2005 – present).

ApologetiX has had multiple other drummers as well, including: their longtime fill-in drummer, Keith Harrold (who played on &quot;Isn&#x27;t Wasn&#x27;t Ain&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;Keep the Change&quot;); David McKee (who played on &quot;Jesus Christ Morningstar&quot; as well as two concerts in 1998); and Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz (the drummer for &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic), who played on seven tracks on &quot;Biblical Graffiti&quot;. Ron Zanski (two shows in 1993) and Allen Muckle (three shows in 2001) have also played with the band.

According to the band&#x27;s website, Yankovic himself has told them that he thinks they do &quot;...fabulous work&quot;.

Since 2014, the band has been following a quarterly release schedule, producing a new studio album about every three months by releasing double singles bi-weekly. From 2014 to 2017, they were able to produce four albums per year. In 2018, their studio computers started to have speed issues, which slowed down the production of their albums. So far they have released two albums, with a third album on its way.

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
ApologetiX rewrites secular songs with Christian lyrics to create parodies with Christian messages, and, in the song &quot;We&#x27;re In A Parody Band,&quot; ApologetiX refers to itself as a cross between &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic and Billy Graham.

The band&#x27;s lyrical content is derived solely from Biblical passages and practices, frequently in a tongue-in-cheek manner. It is also noteworthy that lyrics are often embedded with Scripture references for further exploration of the song&#x27;s content.

Some of their parodies include:

<text>CSS &quot;David&quot; was an American Civil War-era torpedo boat. On October 5, 1863, she undertook a partially successful attack on which was participating in the blockade of Charleston, South Carolina.

==Construction==
Based upon a design by St. Julien Ravenel, &quot;David&quot; was built as a private venture by T. Stoney at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1863, and was put under the control of the Confederate States Navy (CSN). The cigar-shaped boat carried a explosive charge of gunpowder on the end of a spar projecting forward from her bow. CSS &quot;David&quot; operated as a semi-submersible: water was taken into ballast tanks so that only the length of the open-top conning tower and the stack for the boiler appeared above water. Designed to operate very low in the water, &quot;David&quot; resembled in general a submersible submarine; she was, however, strictly a surface vessel. Operating on dark nights, and using anthracite coal (which burns without smoke), &quot;David&quot; was nearly as hard to see as a true submarine.

==Attack on &quot;New Ironsides&quot;==

On the night of October 5, 1863, &quot;David&quot;, commanded by Lieutenant William T. Glassell, CSN, left Charleston Harbor to attack the casemate ironclad steamer . The torpedo boat approached undetected until she was within of the blockader. Hailed by the watch on board &quot;New Ironsides&quot;, Glassell replied with a blast from a shotgun and &quot;David&quot; plunged ahead to strike. Her spar torpedo detonated under the starboard quarter of the ironclad, throwing high a column of water which rained back upon the Confederate vessel and put out her boiler fires. Her engine dead, &quot;David&quot; hung under the quarter of &quot;New Ironsides&quot; while small arms fire from the Federal ship spattered the water around the torpedo boat.

Believing that their vessel was sinking, Glassell and two others abandoned her; the pilot, Walker Cannon, who could not swim, remained on board. A short time later, Assistant Engineer J. H. Tomb swam back to the craft and climbed on board. Rekindling the fires, Tomb succeeded in getting &quot;David&quot;″s engine working again, and with Cannon at the wheel, the torpedo boat steamed up the channel to safety. Glassell and Seaman James Sullivan, &quot;David&quot;″s fireman, were captured. &quot;New Ironsides&quot;, though not sunk, was damaged by the explosion. US Navy casualties were Acting Ensign C.W.Howard (died of gunshot wound), Seaman William L. Knox (legs broken) and Master at Arms Thomas Little (contusions).

The next four months of &quot;David&quot;″s existence are obscure. She or other torpedo boats tried more attacks on Union blockaders; reports from different ships claim three such attempts, all unsuccessful, during the remainder of October 1863. On March 6, 1864, &quot;David&quot; attacked in the North Edisto River. The torpedo boat struck the blockader first on the port quarter, but the torpedo did not explode. &quot;Memphis&quot; slipped her chain, at the same time firing ineffectively at &quot;David&quot; with small arms. Putting about, the torpedo boat struck &quot;Memphis&quot; again, this time a glancing blow on the starboard quarter; once more the torpedo misfired. Since &quot;Memphis&quot; had now opened up with her heavy guns, &quot;David&quot;, having lost part of her stack when rammed, retreated up the river out of range. &quot;Memphis&quot;, undamaged, resumed her blockading station.

&quot;David&quot;″s last confirmed action came on April 18, 1864 when she tried to sink the screw frigate . Alert lookouts on board the blockader sighted &quot;David&quot; in time to permit the frigate to slip her chain, avoid the attack, and open fire on the torpedo boat. Neither side suffered any damage.

The ultimate fate of &quot;David&quot; is uncertain. Several torpedo boats of this type fell into Union hands when Charleston was captured in February 1865. &quot;David&quot; may well have been among them.

==Wrecks discovered==
On January 20, 1998, underwater archaeologist Dr. E. Lee Spence led a Sea Research Society expedition, funded by philanthropist Stanley M. Fulton, to find the remains of the two Confederate torpedo boats shown in various photos taken shortly after the fall of Charleston. Spence&#x27;s theory was that the two vessels had been abandoned where they lay and were simply filled over as the city expanded. Spence used still existing houses in the pictures to triangulate where they might be. Using a ground penetrating radar, operated by Claude E. &quot;Pete&quot; Petrone of &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot;, the expedition located two radar anomalies consistent with what would be expected of the two wrecks. The anomalies were under present-day Tradd Street, so no excavation was done. A post-war letter written by David C. Ebaugh, who supervised the construction of &quot;David&quot;, described her as abandoned at what was then the foot of Tradd Street.


==Other &quot;David&quot;s==
&quot;David&quot; came to be the generic term for any torpedo boat resembling this &quot;David&quot;.
An unknown number of torpedo boats of the &quot;David&quot;-type were built for and operated by the CSN. When Federal forces captured Charleston in February 1865, they found, incomplete, a much larger &quot;David&quot;, with a length of about and designed as a cargo-carrying blockade-runner. This vessel was taken to Washington DC.

<doc id="1263461" wikidata="Q1352878" url="?curid=1263461" title="Duchy of Livonia">
<text>The Duchy of Livonia, also referred to as Polish Livonia or Livonia, was a territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and later the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth that existed from 1561 to 1621. It corresponds to the present-day areas of northern Latvia (Vidzeme and Latgale) and southern Estonia.

==History==
Livonia had been part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from 1561, since the Livonian Order was secularized by the Union of Vilnius and the Livonian Confederation dissolved during the Livonian Wars. Part of Livonia formed the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia while the south-west part of today&#x27;s Estonia and north-east part of today&#x27;s Latvia, covering what are now Vidzeme and Latgale, were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

In 1566, it was declared the Duchy of Livonia according to the Treaty of Union between the landowners of Livonia and authorities of Lithuania; Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz became the first Governor of the Duchy (1566–1578) in Sigulda Castle. It was a province of Grand Duchy of Lithuania until 1569. After the Union of Lublin in 1569, it became a joint domain of the Polish Crown and the Grand Duchy.

The larger part of the Duchy was conquered by Swedish Empire during the Polish–Swedish wars, and their gains were recognized in the Truce of Altmark in 1629. The Commonwealth retained southeastern parts of the Wenden Voivodeship, renamed to Inflanty Voivodeship with the capital in Daugavpils (&quot;Dyneburg&quot;), until the first Partition of Poland in 1772, when it was annexed by Catherine the Great&#x27;s Russian Empire. The title &quot;Prince of Livonia&quot; was added to the grand title of later Russian Emperors.

==Administrative divisions==
* Dorpat Voivodeship (Dorpat) from 1598 to the 1620s
* Parnawa Voivodeship (Parnawa) from 1598 to the 1620s
* Wenden Voivodeship (Wenden) from 1598 to the 1620s

<doc id="1263464" wikidata="Q1403529" url="?curid=1263464" title="Moura, Queensland">
<text>Moura is a rural town and locality in the Shire of Banana in Central Queensland, Australia. It services the surrounding coal mining and rural activities. It is situated approximately west of Biloela on the Dawson Highway, west of the port city of Gladstone, and south west of Rockhampton. In the , the locality of Moura had a population of 1,993 people.

== Economy ==
A number of industries are represented in the local economy. Chief amongst these is coal mining. The name of the local coal mine changes each time it is sold, currently Dawson coal mine, owned and operated by AngloAmerical Coal. Only open-cut mining has been used since 1994. Beef, cotton and cereals are other major industries of the area.

== History ==
In 1854 Charles Marshall named his leased pastoral selection &quot;Moura&quot;. There are two theories regarding the origin of the name. One is that it is named after Moura in Portugal where he served in the British Army during the Peninsular Wars. The other is that it is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;native camp dog&quot;.

The Moura property was developed into a homestead in 1880 by Edward Homer.
The town was first established in 1936 as a farming centre near the existing Moura Station.

The Moura Post Office opened in late 1939.

Moura Provisional School was opened on 10 September 1940. It became Moura State School on 1 January 1948. In 1965 a secondary department was attached to the school. By 1975, there were sufficient secondary students to warrant a formal high school and so Moura State High School was opened on 25 January 1976 with 263 pupils.

=== Mining disasters ===
There have been three mining disasters that have occurred near Moura:

*The first was the Kianga mining disaster occurring due to an explosion in the underground workings of the Kianga No. 1 mine on 20 September 1975, claiming 13 miners&#x27; lives. On 11 March 1978, a memorial centre was officially opened in Moura to commemorate the disaster.
*The second, on 16 July 1986, was an explosion in the Moura No. 4 underground mine, claiming twelve miners&#x27; lives, the youngest miner being 18.
*The third was an explosion in the Moura No. 2 underground coal mine on 7 August 1994. Rescue and recovery attempts were abandoned after a second, more violent explosion occurred 18 hours later. Eleven miners&#x27; lives had been lost and the mine was sealed at the surface.

After 1994, underground mining ceased and the area was operated as an open-cut coal mine.

In November 2017, a routine blast in the mine resulted in ground movement leading to a &quot;circular geotechnical failure&quot; that resulted in a crack through a public access road across the open pit. The road had been a key access and freight route for farmers and graziers to reach the town of Moura, including a school bus route. The road remained closed in February 2018 and was expected to remain unstable indefinitely. The company had conducted improvements to a southern detour route, and consulted with the community about a viable long-term alternative. A new route was proposed which would cross the pit further north, but was expected to take 15 months to complete construction.

== Demographics ==

<doc id="1263466" wikidata="Q643073" url="?curid=1263466" title="São Tomé and Príncipe national football team">
<text>The São Tomé and Príncipe national football team is the national association football team of São Tomé and Príncipe and is controlled by the São Toméan Football Federation. It is a member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and FIFA.

==History==
São Tomé and Príncipe&#x27;s first ever match was a friendly against Gabon in May 1976. They lost by a score of 6–1. Their next game, during the 1976 Central African Games, was a horrendous 11–0 loss to Congo, São Tomé&#x27;s largest loss to date. São Tomé rounded off the competition with a 2–1 loss to Central African Republic and a 5–0 loss to Chad.

The following year, São Tomé picked up their first win, in a friendly versus Rwanda. In both 1978 and 1987 they achieved a draw at home to Angola.

The Green and Yellows took an eleven year break, before a string of matches including their first entry to a FIFA sanctioned tournament. At the UNIFAC Cup in 1999, they achieved their second win, 2–0 against Equatorial Guinea. They won the next game after that, against Sierra Leone, 2–0. This two-in-a-row streak accompanied with a draw a few matches later placed them at their highest FIFA ranking to date, 179.

In 2003, São Tomé lost to Libya 1–0 and 8–0, which was a major blow to their previous success. São Tomé did not participate in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup, withdrawing before their first match, leaving them unranked in the FIFA rankings because they did not play any matches for four years.

On 11 November 2011, after an eight-year hiatus, São Tomé and Príncipe participated in the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, losing to Congo 5–0, then drawing 1–1 with the same team four days later. São Tomé were reinstated in the FIFA rankings on 23 November 2011, entering at number 192.

In January 2012, in the preliminary round of 2013 AFCON Qualifiers, São Tomé achieved their first ever aggregate win, defeating Lesotho 1–0 at home then successfully defending a 0–0 draw in Maseru seven days later. In the next round, São Tomé only narrowly lost 5–4 on aggregate to Sierra Leone. In the following years, São Tomé continued to show promise with impressive wins at home to Ethiopia and Libya but poor away results prevented them from advancing again.

On 9 October 2019, São Tomé defeated Mauritius 1–3 away from home in the first leg of their preliminary round tie of 2021 AFCON Qualifiers. This was São Tomé and Príncipe&#x27;s first away win in a competitive match ever. Four days later, São Tomé won 2–1 at home to advance 5–2 on aggregate and enter Group C, facing Ghana, South Africa and Sudan, where they finished bottom with zero points.

During the 2023 AFCON qualifiers, São Tomé faced Mauritius, winning the first leg 1–0 before drawing the second leg 3–3 to advance to the group stages. Following the fixtures CAF sanctioned São Tomé for their first leg victory as they hadn&#x27;t followed COVID protocol for Luis Leal, giving Mauritius a 3–0 victory and eliminating São Tomé from the competition. São Tomé appealed the decision and, following an initial unsuccessful ruling, they were reinstated by CAF a week before the first qualifying group game.

<doc id="1263467" wikidata="Q152784" url="?curid=1263467" title="The North Face">
<text>The North Face is an American outdoor recreation products company. The North Face produces outdoor clothing, footwear, and related equipment. Founded in 1968 to supply climbers, the company&#x27;s logo draws inspiration from Half Dome, a distinct rock formation rising over above sea level in Yosemite National Park. By the late 1990s, the label had expanded beyond outdoor enthusiasts by focusing on street couture and since the 2000s it is regarded as a streetwear style symbol label. In 2000, it was bought by VF Corporation.

== History ==

In 1964, Douglas Tompkins and his wife, Susie Tompkins borrowed $5,000 from a bank to found &quot;The North Face, Inc.&quot;, in San Francisco, as a mail order and retail company, selling rock climbing and camping equipment. Tompkins designed tents that avoided a pole in the middle, by using bendable rods threaded through exterior sleeves instead. This widely copied design also increased the strength of the tent because the domed shape allowed the wind to roll over it.

On October 26, 1966, the first The North Face store opened at 308 Columbus Ave in San Francisco,&lt;ref name=&quot;gq/tompkins-excerpt&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and the band The Grateful Dead played at its grand opening.

On November 14, 1967, for &quot;Rite of Winter&quot;, Steve Miller Blues Band and Jesse Fuller played to celebrate the opening of the second store in the Old Stanford Barn,&lt;ref name=&quot;paloaltoonline/1999-02-17.LOOKBACK&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; near the Stanford Shopping Center, near Stanford University.&lt;ref name=&quot;rockprosopography101/steve-miller_26&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Tompkins sold out his stake to Kenneth &quot;Hap&quot; Klopp for $50,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;kauffman.org/Klopp&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and set off on a six month road trip to climb Mount FitzRoy in the wilds of Patagonia.

Tompkins joined his wife in co-founding Esprit, a fashion house. Tompkins sold The North Face with the intention of a focus on adventure film making.

In 2000, The North Face was acquired by VF Corporation in a deal worth US$25.4 million and became a wholly owned subsidiary.

In December 2008, The North Face filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against The South Butt, its creator James A. Winkelmann Jr., and a company that handled the firm&#x27;s marketing and manufacturing. In the legal action, The North Face alleged trademark infringement and sought injunctive relief. After the court ordered mediation in the case, the parties reached a closed settlement agreement on April 1, 2010; however, in October 2012, Winkelmann admitted in court that he and his father violated the settlement agreement with The North Face and agreed to pay US$65,000, an amount that will be reduced by US$1,000 for every month of compliance.
In 2019, The North Face faced consumer backlash and apologized after its marketing agency surreptitiously added photos featuring its apparel to Wikipedia articles on popular outdoor destinations.

The company was previously headquartered in Alameda, California, co-located with its corporate sibling, JanSport. In 2020, the company&#x27;s headquarters relocated to Denver, Colorado.

A credential stuffing attack against The North Face&#x27;s website began on July 26, 2022. However, the administrators of the website discovered the &quot;unusual activity&quot; on August 11 and were able to stop it by August 19. The breach compromised 194,905 customer accounts.

In March 2024, The North Face began offering a 20% discount to customers who watch a four-part, one-hour &quot;racial inclusion&quot; course, titled the &quot;Allyship in the Outdoors&quot; programme which aims to &quot;foster a deeper understanding of the unique challenges that people of colour face when accessing the outdoors&quot;. The questionnaire covers topics such as white privilege, acknowledging &quot;lived experiences&quot;, and different types of racism. The course begins by asking the customer &quot;How many people of color do you see on the slopes, on the hills, or on the trails?&quot;, and at the end asks the customer to become an ally to their cause. The company faced a backlash from right-wing commentators who accused the program of being &quot;woke capitalism at its worst&quot;.

== Fashion ==
By 1997, purchasers of North Face attire had expanded beyond those looking for technical clothing for skiing, climbing, and other outdoor pursuits to rappers in New York City, but remained only a small part of the company&#x27;s business.

In 2005, wearers of the North Face attire became the targets of robbery in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. A similar trend occurred in South Korea in the early 2010s where it became a status symbol, resulting in children being bullied or having their North Face apparel stolen.

<doc id="1263477" wikidata="Q1427468" url="?curid=1263477" title="Flavia Caesariensis">
<text>Flavia Caesariensis (Latin for &quot;The Caesarian province of Flavius&quot;), sometimes known as Britannia Flavia, was one of the provinces of the Diocese of &quot;the Britains&quot; created during the Diocletian Reforms at the end of the 3rd century. It was probably created after the defeat of the usurper Allectus by Constantius Chlorus in AD 296 and was mentioned in the Verona List of the Roman provinces. It seems to have been named after Chlorus&#x27;s family and was probably located beside Maxima Caesariensis, but their positions and capitals remain uncertain. At present, most scholars place Flavia Caesariensis in the southern Pennines, possibly reaching the Irish Sea and including the lands of the Iceni. Its capital is sometimes placed at Lindum Colonia (Lincoln).


==History==
Following the Roman conquest, Britain was administered as a single province from Camulodunum (Colchester) and then Londinium (London) until the Severan Reforms following the revolt of its governor Clodius Albinus. These divided the territory into Upper and Lower Britain (&quot;Britannia Superior&quot; and &quot;Inferior&quot;), whose respective capitals were at Londinium and Eboracum (York). During the first phases of the Diocletian Reforms, Britain was under the control of the Allectus&#x27;s Britannic Empire as part of the Carausian Revolt. At some point after the territory was retaken by Constantius Chlorus in AD 296, the Diocese of the Britains (with its vicar at Londinium) was formed and made a part of Prefecture of Gaul. The Britains were divided among three, four, or five provinces, which seem to have borne the names Prima, Secunda, Maxima Caesariensis, and (possibly) Flavia Caesariensis and Valentia.

The placement and capitals of these late British provinces are uncertain, although the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; lists the governor (&quot;&quot;) of Flavia being of equestrian rank, making it unlikely to have been based in Londinium. The list of bishops who attended the 314 Council of Arles is patently corrupt but generally assumed to have mimicked the Roman administration: the identification of Lindum Colonia as a provincial capital rests on proposed emendations of one or the other of the bishops from the cities &quot;Londinensi&quot; and &quot;colonia Londinensium&quot;. Those emendations are highly speculative: Bishop Ussher proposed &quot;Colonia&quot;, Selden &quot;Camaloden&quot; or &quot;Camalodon&quot;, and Spelman &quot;Camalodunum&quot; (all various names of Colchester); Camden took it as Caerleon, with Bishop Stillingfleet and Thackery proposing that a scribal error created &quot;Civ. Col. Londin.&quot; from an original &quot;Civ. Col. Leg. II&quot; (Caerleon).

Describing the metropolitan sees of the early British church established by SS Fagan and &quot;Duvian&quot;, Gerald of Wales placed Flavia around London, extending into Mercia. Bertram&#x27;s highly-influential forgery &quot;The Description of Britain&quot; placed it similarly: although not including London, it included central England and was bound by the Severn, the Thames, the North Sea, and the Humber and Mersey; this was accepted for a century from the 1740s to the 1840s before being revealed as a forgery. Modern scholars usually place Londinium in Maxima rather than Flavia. Birley has argued that Maxima and Flavia originally consisted of a single province, which received the name &quot;Britannia Caesariensis&quot; as a mark of favour for support against the rebel Allectus in 296. Although Flavia is usually thought to have been formed from the old province of Lower Britain, Birley proposes that Upper Britain was divided in two (between Prima and Caesariensis) and then three (Prima, Maxima, and Flavia). This repeats Camden&#x27;s earlier theory (relying on Sextus Rufus) that Maxima was formed first and Flavia followed sometime after. Supporters of a later creation of Flavia note that it need not refer to Constantius Chlorus himself: instead, it may have honored any of Constantine, Valentinian, or Theodosius.

<doc id="1263486" wikidata="Q434305" url="?curid=1263486" title="Altamont Pass">
<text>Altamont Pass, formerly Livermore Pass, is a low mountain pass in the Diablo Range of Northern California between Livermore in the Livermore Valley and Tracy in the San Joaquin Valley. The name is actually applied to two distinct but nearby crossings of the range. The lower of the two, at an elevation of , carries two railroad rights-of-way (ROWs) and Altamont Pass Road, part of the old Lincoln Highway and the original alignment of US 50 before it was bypassed in 1937. The bypass route travels over the higher summit, at , and now carries Interstate 580, a major regional highway heavily congested by Central Valley suburbanization.

Of the two railroad lines through the old pass, one is still in use: the ex-Western Pacific line built in 1908 over the pass, which is sometimes known as the Altamont Corridor, now owned by Union Pacific. It carries freight trains as well as the Altamont Corridor Express, which gives its occasional name (ACE) and operates between Stockton, Livermore, Pleasanton, Fremont, and San Jose. The other and older right-of-way was the line built in 1869 with a summit tunnel by the original Western Pacific Railroad (1862–1870) as part of the transcontinental railroad. After 1879, when a sea level ferry crossing at the Carquinez Strait replaced the 1869 route, it remained in use for other purposes by the Southern Pacific. In 1984 it was abandoned and deeded to Alameda County by Southern Pacific Railroad in favor of trackage rights on the aforementioned ex-Western Pacific line.

From 1966 to 2008, the Altamont Pass area was home to the Altamont Speedway, which became famous as the site of the 1969 Altamont Free Concert, a large outdoor concert featuring The Rolling Stones and marred by violence. The pass is also known for the Altamont Pass Wind Farm, one of the largest concentrations of wind turbines in the world.

== History ==
From the time of the California Gold Rush, what is now Altamont Pass was called Livermore&#x27;s Pass after Robert Livermore, the owner of the Rancho Las Positas and a way station near the pass. After the transcontinental railroad was built through the pass by Chinese laborers in 1869, Altamont, formerly The Summit, became a critical stopping point where helper engines pushed heavy trains over the steep grades of the pass. 

A narrow road, the Altamont Pass Road (once called the Stockton Road), was an early stagecoach route and formed part of the transcontinental Lincoln Highway. In 1938, Highway 50, a four lane freeway (now called Interstate 580) was built through Altamont Pass, replacing the two-lane Altamont Pass Road and bypassing Altamont. Four westbound lanes were later constructed in 1970.

<doc id="1263491" wikidata="Q846693" url="?curid=1263491" title="Countdown with Keith Olbermann">
<text>Countdown with Keith Olbermann is a weekday podcast that originated as an hour-long weeknight news and political commentary program hosted by Keith Olbermann that aired on MSNBC from 2003 to 2011 and on Current TV from 2011 to 2012. The show presented five selected news stories of the day, with commentary by Olbermann and interviews of guests. At the start of &quot;Countdown&quot;, Olbermann told television columnist Lisa de Moraes: Our charge for the immediate future is to stay out of the way of the news. ... News is the news. We will not be screwing around with it. ... As times improve and the war [in Iraq] ends we will begin to introduce more and more elements familiar to my style.

The show was known for Olbermann&#x27;s fast-paced rhetoric, historical and pop culture references, and liberal commentary. Olbermann melded news stories, both serious and light, with commentary, much of it critical of Republicans and conservative politics. The show has been the source of controversy owing to these criticisms, as well as the host&#x27;s ongoing commentary against Fox News and his feud with its leading primetime personality Bill O&#x27;Reilly.

During the January 21, 2011, edition of &quot;Countdown&quot;, Olbermann announced that it would be his last appearance on the show, but he gave no explanation why. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the following day that Olbermann had negotiated his exit from MSNBC with a secret deal. After being hired by Current TV, Olbermann announced on April 26, 2011, that his nightly news program on the new network would begin June 20, 2011, and would also be called &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;. On March 30, 2012, Current TV abruptly terminated its relationship with Olbermann and replaced his show with a program hosted by Eliot Spitzer.

On August 1, 2022, Olbermann began producing and hosting a weekday podcast also titled &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, for iHeart Media.

==History==
===MSNBC period===
&quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; began as a successor program to Countdown: Iraq with anchor Lester Holt, which ran from October 2002 until March 31, 2003, anticipating and providing coverage for the Iraq War. &quot;Countdown: Iraq&quot; was broadcast at 8:00 p.m. on weekday nights, having replaced a cancelled talk show hosted by Phil Donahue. Olbermann, who left MSNBC in the late 1990s, returned to the network around this time and replaced Holt, becoming the permanent host for the renamed &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;. The show did not feature political commentary in its first few years, simply recapping the news of the day in a &quot;5-4-3-2-1&quot; format as the title suggested.

&quot;Countdown&quot; began to attract liberal and progressive viewers in 2005 when Olbermann began critiquing and satirizing conservative media commentators, specifically Fox News and its main primetime anchor Bill O&#x27;Reilly. He criticized Fox and O&#x27;Reilly for purportedly deceiving their viewers in service to their alleged right-wing biases, frequently including the latter in &quot;Countdown&quot; &quot;Worst Person in the World&quot; segment. O&#x27;Reilly, while not directly mentioning Olbermann, launched an online petition implicitly asking MSNBC to fire him, and, in conjunction with a call-in campaign organized by Mike Stark, threatened Stark for mentioning Olbermann by name after phoning in to O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s radio show. O&#x27;Reilly and other Fox personalities accused MSNBC of facilitating a liberal media bias, in what Olbermann described as a war of attrition intended to force him into silence.

In 2006, Olbermann started delivering occasional &quot;Special Comments&quot; in which he has expressed sharp criticisms of members of the George W. Bush administration, including then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Vice President Dick Cheney and President George W. Bush. While further Special Comments were directed at members of the Republican Party, Olbermann occasionally targeted Democrats as well. Issues addressed in the Special Comments dealt with the Bush Administration&#x27;s foreign and domestic policies, mainly the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of the Special Comments spoke out against the passage of Proposition 8 in California on November 4, 2008, for which he was awarded the 2009 GLAAD Media Award for &quot;Outstanding TV Journalism Segment&quot;. Olbermann&#x27;s Special Comments were compared to Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s signature essays.

On two occasions, guest hosts for &quot;Countdown&quot; proved popular enough to be given their own MSNBC shows, contributing to a widespread perception of MSNBC being a left-leaning network. In 2008, Air America Radio personality Rachel Maddow hosted &quot;Countdown&quot; in Olbermann&#x27;s absence, leading to the debut of her own program, &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;. In 2009, left-wing political analyst Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell hosted &quot;Countdown&quot; for an extended period, leading to the eventual launch of his show &quot;The Last Word&quot;. Subsequent guest hosts included progressive radio hosts Cenk Uygur and Sam Seder, Obama biographer Richard Wolffe, journalist Chris Hayes, and DNC chairman Howard Dean.

====Hiatus and first cancellation====
On October 28, 2010, five days before the 2010 U.S. elections, Olbermann donated $2,400 each to three Democratic candidates for Congress: Kentucky Senate candidate Jack Conway and Arizona Democratic Representatives Raul Grijalva and Gabby Giffords. In response, MSNBC President Phil Griffin suspended Olbermann indefinitely without pay on November 5 for violating a network policy regarding political contributions which required prior approval from management. An online petition calling for his reinstatement received over 250,000 signatures, and two days after the suspension began, Griffin announced that Olbermann would return to the air starting with the November 9 program.

On the January 21, 2011, episode of &quot;Countdown&quot;, Olbermann abruptly announced that the show would be his final MSNBC broadcast. Olbermann thanked viewers, producers, and technical staff for his show&#x27;s eight-year success. However, he did not thank Griffin or NBC News president Steve Capus. Neither MSNBC nor Olbermann divulged the reason for his departure. Many liberal bloggers and commentators blamed the cable operator Comcast for Olbermann&#x27;s firing, accusing the company of silencing the host for political purposes just days after Comcast acquired NBC Universal on January 18. Statements from MSNBC and Comcast denied this allegation. Media critic Howard Kurtz, former MSNBC anchor David Shuster, and an anonymous NBC News executive said that Olbermann&#x27;s 2010 suspension was a more likely precipitating factor in &quot;Countdown&quot; cancellation.

In subsequent interviews, Olbermann went into greater detail about the circumstances surrounding his exit from MSNBC. In an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; published on June 7, 2011, Olbermann said he had faced increasing opposition from network management after the death of Tim Russert in June, 2008; Russert, the NBC Washington news bureau chief and moderator of &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, had been Olbermann&#x27;s advocate and a peacemaker at the network. Olbermann further stated that &quot;there were lots of people who were forced to choose sides&quot; over his presence at MSNBC, including Maddow. Olbermann further claimed that he was not informed of his dismissal from MSNBC until less than a half-hour before his on-air farewell.

However, Olbermann&#x27;s 2012 breach-of-contract lawsuit against Current TV indicated that Olbermann had been moved to leave MSNBC by Current founders Al Gore and Joel Hyatt. The lawsuit alleged that Gore and Hyatt had attempted to court Olbermann, despite being informed that he had two years remaining on his MSNBC contract, and reached an agreement for him to join the network the same month as his departure from MSNBC, according to court documents acquired by Warner Bros.-owned TMZ.

===Current TV period===
On February 8, Olbermann announced that he had been hired as the host of a new primetime show on Current TV, the cable television network founded by former vice president Al Gore and businessman Joel Hyatt; in April it was announced that the show would retain the &quot;Countdown&quot; title. Olbermann also became Current TV&#x27;s &quot;Chief News Officer&quot; and bought an equity stake in the network. On May 11, Olbermann announced that &quot;Daily Kos&quot; founder Markos Moulitsas, filmmakers Michael Moore and Ken Burns, and comedian Richard Lewis would become contributors to the new &quot;Countdown&quot;. During a June 16 interview on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, Olbermann further announced that journalists Matt Taibbi and Jeremy Scahill, former Nixon administration official and author John Dean, actor Donald Sutherland, and astronomer Derrick Pitts would also be contributors.

On June 20, &quot;Countdown&quot; debuted on Current TV, concluding with an abbreviated &quot;Special Comment&quot; in which Olbermann outlined his mission statement, quoting Harriet Beecher Stowe. The program drew 179,000 viewers, a significant increase from Current TV&#x27;s typical 30,000 
viewership; it drew more viewers than CNN in the key 25-54 audience demographic. &quot;Countdown&quot; continued to beat CNN in the 25-54 demo throughout its first week on Current TV. &quot;Countdown&quot; saw a drop in ratings in its second week, but sustained an audience of 310,000 total viewers by September. The show was taped at NEP Studio 33.

For the first two weeks of its Current TV run, &quot;Countdown&quot; ran slightly longer than an hour at sixty-three minutes in a covert effort to erode MSNBC&#x27;s viewership. However, Olbermann changed his mind and reverted the running time to the usual sixty minutes, realizing the move &quot;would only serve to annoy fans of&quot; both &quot;Countdown&quot; and Rachel Maddow&#x27;s MSNBC show while doing nothing to improve the ratings for his own program. By the fall of 2011, Olbermann came into conflict with Current TV management over production values and creative control and nearly left the network.

====Second cancellation====
On March 30, 2012, Current TV terminated its contract with Olbermann, thereby cancelling &quot;Countdown&quot; for a second time. In its statement, Current TV cited Olbermann&#x27;s implied lack of &quot;respect, openness, collegiality, and loyalty to our viewers.&quot; Internal sources reported that Olbermann&#x27;s repeated absences, his failure to promote Current TV, and disparaging public comments he had made about the network contributed to the decision to fire him. Olbermann called Current TV&#x27;s claims &quot;untrue&quot; and sued the network for breach-of-contract, demanding $50 million in damages. A counter-suit by Current TV cited Olbermann&#x27;s work absences, as well as his allegedly abusive treatment of executives and staff. In March 2013, Olbermann and Current TV reached a settlement, with Olbermann receiving an undisclosed amount.

On April 3, 2012, Olbermann appeared on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and voiced concern for his viewers and the production crew on &quot;Countdown&quot;, stating: &quot;I screwed up. I screwed up really big on this.&quot; Olbermann referred to production issues, in-fighting, and key absences during political events as the primary reasons Current TV decided to pull &quot;Countdown&quot; from the network lineup.

===Podcast===
The daily podcast &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; launched on August 1, 2022, airing on iHeartMedia. It contains features from Olbermann&#x27;s previous tv show of the same title, such as current events, political analysis, and sports, as well Olbermann’s career anecdotes and his “Worst Person in the World” segment.

==About the show==
The show&#x27;s theme music was the opening bars of the second movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, a nod to NBC&#x27;s &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; and &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; themes from the 1960s and 1970s. During the opening sequence of each nightly episode, Olbermann, in voice-over, previewed upcoming stories after asking: &quot;Which of these stories will you be talking about tomorrow?&quot; On MSNBC, the stories featured in the show&#x27;s &quot;countdown&quot; were introduced by a &quot;5-4-3-2-1&quot; format; this format, however, was downplayed after &quot;Countdown&quot; move to Current TV.

Musical commentary on the podcast is often provided by Nancy Faust on the &quot;Stadium Organ.&quot; Olbermann frequently refers to her in closing credits as &quot;the best baseball stadium organist ever&quot;.

===Special comments===
===&quot;Worst Person in the World&quot; segment===

The &quot;Worst Person in the World&quot; segment was a nightly feature in which Olbermann recounts three news stories involving people saying or doing things that offended Olbermann. &quot;Nominees&quot; for the &quot;Worst Person in the World&quot; award were declared &quot;worse&quot;, &quot;worser&quot;, and &quot;worst&quot;, which Olbermann refers to as bronze, silver, and gold levels, respectively. On a few occasions, during the show&#x27;s MSNBC run, the segment was either briefly suspended or renamed in response to concerns that it contributed to an atmosphere of political divisiveness.

Based on this segment of the show, a book titled &quot;The Worst Person in the World&quot; was published in September 2006. It includes transcripts of segments that aired from this feature&#x27;s inception on July 1, 2005, through May 31, 2006, as well as some original material. Another such book, &quot;Pitchforks and Torches&quot;—named after Olbermann&#x27;s catchphrase in introducing the segment—was released in 2010.

A modified version, focused on sports, was featured on Olbermann&#x27;s self titled ESPN2 sports show during its run. In this iteration the segment was preceded by a disclaimer that the nominations weren&#x27;t meant entirely seriously and that those nominated were not literally the worst people in the sports world. 

On October 7, 2020, Olbermann revived the &quot;Worst Person in the World&quot; branding for a current-events webseries, delivering an extended commentary on one selected individual (either Donald Trump or someone associated with his administration) followed by a brief rundown of other news headlines. Beginning with the fifteenth episode, dated October 27, the series was renamed &quot;Olbermann vs. Trump&quot;.

===&quot;Time Marches On&quot; segment===
In the &quot;Time Marches On&quot; segment, another nightly feature, Olbermann showed footage of strange news stories from around the world. The segment was originally called &quot;Oddball&quot;, a reference to the MSNBC program &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;.

===The &quot;Keith number&quot;===
During the 2008 U.S. Presidential Primary season, Olbermann began using the term &quot;Keith number&quot; in reference to the sum of a pre-election opinion poll&#x27;s margin of error and the percentage of respondents who are undecided. Olbermann believes this value tends to be predictive of the extent to which a poll may vary from actual election results, and also of the volatility of the electorate&#x27;s leanings.

To summarize:
* The greater the poll&#x27;s margin of error, the farther the results may be from the &quot;current&quot; views of the voters.
* The more undecided voters, the more likely voters are to change their views in the &quot;future&quot;.

On the January 11, 2008, episode of &quot;Countdown&quot;, Olbermann described the number as follows:
Olbermann&#x27;s &quot;Keith number&quot; is unrelated (mathematically or otherwise) to the more traditional use of the term.

==Criticism and response==
Olbermann has addressed the assertions of liberal bias by stating that he would be equally critical of a Democratic president who had invited criticism by his actions: I mean, no one in 1998, no one accused me of being a liberal in 1998 because I was covering the Lewinsky scandal. And whatever I had to do about it, I tried to be fair and honest and as accurate and as informed as possible, and allow my viewer to be the same way. And nowadays it&#x27;s the same thing. And now all of a sudden I&#x27;m a screaming liberal.
However, Howard Kurtz has written that Olbermann departed MSNBC the first time as a result of the Clinton-Lewinsky coverage, which he did not personally agree with. Elsewhere, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; TV critic Howard Rosenberg commented on the show&#x27;s absence of guests who challenged Olbermann&#x27;s views, writing: &quot;&#x27;Countdown&#x27; is more or less an echo chamber in which Olbermann and like-minded bobbleheads nod at each other.&quot;

On November 25, 2006, &quot;Fox News Watch&quot; panelist Cal Thomas named Olbermann as his choice for 2006&#x27;s &quot;Media Turkey Award&quot; for what Thomas alleged were Olbermann&#x27;s &quot;inaccuracies&quot; and &quot;hot air&quot;. Olbermann in turn gave the show the Bronze for &quot;Worst Person in the World&quot;, not for naming him &quot;Turkey of the Year&quot; but for misspelling his last name as &quot;Olberman&quot; on the onscreen graphic.

<text>Alexander Pavlovich Kutepov (; 28 September 1882 – 26 January 1930) Russian military officer in the Imperial Russian Army and later an officer in the anti-communist Volunteer Army during the Russian Civil War. From 1928 to 1930 he chaired the Russian All-Military Union (ROVS). He was assassinated after being abducted by OGPU agents in Paris in 1930.

== Early life and military career ==
Alexander Kutepov was born into the family of a personal nobleman, Konstantin Mikhailovich Timofeev, and his wife, Olga Andreevna, in Cherepovets, Novgorod Governorate. In 1890, Konstantin died. In 1892, Olga Andreevna married hereditary nobleman Pavel Aleksandrovich Kutepov, an official for peasant affairs of the Foresters&#x27; Corps; after the Stolypin reform, he became chairman of the Land Survey Commission. On 9 March 1893, by a ruling from the Novgorod District Court, children born by Olga Andreevna in her first marriage (including Alexander) were legally adopted by her second husband, Pavel.

Alexander Kutepov was educated at the Arkhangelsk gymnasium (graduated from 7th grade). In 1902 he entered the Junker Infantry School in St. Petersburg, from which he graduated in the 1st category. A year later, the younger clerk-junker Kutepov had been noticed at the parade by the Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich, who appointed him right away to sergeant-major, bypassing the rank of senior caravan-junker. 

=== Participation in the Russo-Japanese War ===
As a young infantry officer, he fought in the Russo-Japanese War, where he was severely wounded in action and decorated for valor. On 9 August 1904 he was promoted to lieutenant of the 85th Vyborg Infantry Regiment, one of the oldest formations within the Russian Army. 

Upon arrival at the regiment, Kutepov asked for the appointment into the survey corps — the group that was entrusted with the most dangerous missions. Soon he led a night-time raid on a Japanese outpost in which Russian scouts captured rich trophies, including machine guns and rifles. 

The Order of St. George was awarded to the head of the survey corps, who had not participated in the raid. When the details of the operation became known after the war, efforts were made to ensure that Kutepov also received the order. Kutepov was ultimately awarded the order of the German Crown with swords and on the ribbon of the Iron Cross through the intervention of German emperor Wilhelm, after whom the Regiment was named.

Alexander Pavlovich was returning from Manchuria to the capital separately from his regiment after being appointed to a special team sent to Russia to train new recruits. Here Kutepov first encountered a revolution: en route to Saint Petersburg, they stopped in a community where the local revolutionaries had declared a republic, the administration was confused, and he had to break through, taking full responsibility for the echelon and arresting the strike committee of the railway station. Upon arrival in Saint Petersburg, on a presentation to the emperor, Kutepov received from the Tsar&#x27;s hands the Order of St. Vladimir of the 4th degree with swords and a bow for his front-line services.

=== Officer of the Preobrazhensky Regiment ===
In 1906, he was transferred to the Preobrazhensky Regiment, an elite guards regiment. Beginning as a lieutenant in 1907, he became a captain in 1911, serving as an assistant to the head of the training team, head of the machine gun team, head of the survey team, commander of the 15th company, and head of the training team.

With the beginning of mobilization, the training team was disbanded, and Kutepov accepted the 4th company of the Preobrazhensky Life-Guard Regiment, with which he went to the front in the First World War. He was wounded in a battle near Vladislavov on 20 August 1914. In 1915 he was promoted to captain with seniority from 19 July 1915. He was awarded the Order of St. George 4th degree: &quot;For the fact that on July 27, 1915, in the battle near the village of Petrilov, when the Germans, after intensifying the preparation of heavy guns with artillery fire, captured the trenches of one of the companies, he, being in private support, not being able to receive instructions on the terms of the battle, on his own initiative, he went over to the counter-attack and, despite significant losses, knocked out the enemy from their position and restored his position, and although he was badly wounded, he continued to lead the battle until the evening.&quot;

As a result of this counterattack, the German offensive was delayed for several hours. After the 4th company, he commanded a company of His Majesty and the 2nd battalion. Granted by George&#x27;s Arms
: &quot;Because being in the rank of captain in the battle on September 7, 1916 near the Svinukh forest, commanding the 2nd battalion and having advanced under hurricane fire from the right flank of the division over its left combat area, from the battle captured enemy trenches north of the Svinukh forest, restrained them by repulsing a series of fierce counter-attacks by the Germans, filling a dangerous breakthrough between the Life Guards Izmailovsky and Semenovsky regiments, thereby contributing to the successful outcome of the entire battle.&quot;

During the course of the war, he rose from company, to battalion to commander of the Preobrazhensky Regiment when he was promoted to colonel on 25 November 1916 with seniority from 26 September 1916. As such, he became the last commander of this historic regiment. 

In December 1916, Colonel Kutepov was elected by the general meeting of officers of the regiment to the court of honor and to his administrative team. 1 April 1917, already in the context of the ongoing &quot;democratization&quot; of the army, was re-elected to the court of honor. He was awarded the Order of Saint Anna of the 4th degree with the inscription &quot;For Courage&quot; and the St. Stanislav of the 3rd degree with swords .

=== The February Revolution ===
During the February Revolution, Colonel Kutepov, who was on short leave in Petrograd, turned out to be the only senior officer who tried to organize effective resistance to the rebels by leading, on behalf of the commander of the Petrograd Military District, General S.S. Khabalov, a combined detachment aimed at suppressing the revolution. However, his detachment was not supported by other military units located in Petrograd, and part of the officers sent to his disposal showed no desire to fight for the monarchy. In this situation, Kutepov&#x27;s detachment could not have a serious impact on the development of events and was forced to stop resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruguard.ru/glossary/o-38.html_2020-05-26&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After the victory of the revolution, he returned to the front as the commander of the Preobrazhensky Life-Guard Regiment, which was one of the few units of the army that retained combat effectiveness in conditions of active anti-war agitation. He was recommended for the award of the Order of St. George of the 3rd degree for distinctive service in the battles near the village of Mshany during the Tarnopol breakthrough, on 7 July 1917, but did not receive it because of the recommendation did not reach the government in the post-revolutionary chaos.
According to his fellow officer V. Deutrich:
:&quot;Kutepov’s name has become an eyesore. It means fidelity to duty, calm determination, intense sacrificial impulse, cold, sometimes cruel will and ... clean hands — and all this is brought and given to the service of the Motherland&quot;.

== Russian Civil War ==

After the October Revolution, Kutepov joined the anti-Bolshevik Volunteer Army, part of the White Movement, at the very outset of the Russian Civil War. At the start of the Ice March in early 1918, Kutepov was a company commander of an officer&#x27;s regiment. (In the beginning of the Russian Civil War the small Volunteer Army had a surplus of officers, which meant that many of them had to serve as common soldiers. These formations soon became the crack units of the White Army.) 

After the death in battle of Colonel Nezhentsev, Kutepov took over the command of the Kornilov Shock Regiment, and after the death of the commander of the 1st Infantry Division, he became its commander. After the Volunteer Army captured Novorossiysk, Denikin assigned Colonel Kutepov as governor.

Starting in January 1919, 36-year-old Lieutenant General Kutepov became the commander of the 1st Army Corps of the White Army. Throughout his career, Kutepov had a reputation for being a decisive, direct and no-nonsense military leader. During the chaotic times of the Russian Civil War, order was usually rapidly restored after Kutepov&#x27;s arrival. He accomplished this, however, by means of the swift and ruthless application of capital punishment on suspected looters and pogrom perpetrators. At the same time, however, Kutepov ordered mass executions of hundreds of Red Army soldiers and thousands of workers suspected of sympathizing with the Bolsheviks.

== In exile ==

After the White Army&#x27;s final defeat in the Crimean Peninsula in November 1920, Kutepov and the remnants of his corps evacuated to Gallipoli. Despite very unfavourable and demoralizing circumstances, the troops in Gallipoli kept up their morale thanks to Kutepov&#x27;s leadership. In the beginning of the Gallipoli period, Kutepov was disliked by many of the troops because of his disciplinary measures, but by the end, he was warmly regarded by most of them. When the Gallipoli camp was disbanded, Kutepov moved to Bulgaria in late 1921.

In May 1922, he was expelled from Bulgaria during the upheavals of the Aleksandar Stamboliyski era and resided in Serbia until 1924, when he and his wife settled in Paris. After General Pyotr Wrangel&#x27;s death in April 1928, he became the commander of the Russian All-Military Union (ROVS). In this position, he abandoned the ROVS&#x27; strategy of waiting for Western powers&#x27; intervention in Russia; instead he stepped up sabotage and terrorist activities by ROVS inside the USSR. He is credited with setting up a counter-intelligence branch of ROVS, the Inner Line.

== Abduction and death ==

On 26 January 1930, Kutepov was kidnapped in Paris by OGPU agents. According to Pavel Sudoplatov, 
This job in 1930 was done by Yakov Serebryansky, assisted by his wife and an agent in the French police. Dressed in French police uniforms, they stopped Kutepov on the street on the pretext of questioning him and put him in a car. Kutepov resisted the kidnapping, and during the struggle, he had a heart attack and died, Serebryansky told me. They buried Kutepov near the home of one of our agents near the outskirts of Paris.

The operation was also led by deputy head of the counterintelligence department of the OGPU Sergei Puzitsky.

Kutepov was believed by French police of having been smuggled to the Soviet Union. Former White Army general Nikolai Skoblin, a senior operative in the Inner Line, was suspected of being a key accomplice to the kidnapping. Walter Laqueur alleges, however, &quot;Skoblin had nothing to do with this affair, because he was recruited only after Kutyopov&#x27;s disappearance.&quot; KGB General Sudoplatov confirms this allegation in his own memoirs.

According to the declassified UDBA documents compiled in early 1955, shortly prior to his abduction, Kutepov received 7 million francs from his French sponsors meant for the ROVS&#x27; activity.

His body was never found. There is a cenotaph memorial for Alexander Kutepov in the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery in Paris.

The son of General Kutepov, Pavel Aleksandrovich (1925-1983) in 1944 crossed the front line in Yugoslavia and joined the Red Army, served as a translator in SMERSH, but was soon arrested and taken to the USSR, where he was interned in the Vladimir Central Prison. He was released in 1954, in 1960-1983 he worked as a translator in the Department for External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate.

Grandchildren - Alexander and Alexey.

In the research literature there are references to the general&#x27;s niece, Maria Vladislavovna Zakharchenko-Schulz, while the historian P. N. Bazanov wrote that this was a nickname, explaining his appearance by the fact that Zakharchenko-Schulz was a distant relative of Kutepov. The historian G.Z. Ioffe also wrote that it is incorrect to call Zakharchenko-Schulz a niece, since &quot;niece&quot; was her code name in correspondence with persons who collaborated with &quot;Trust&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magazines.gorky.media/nj/2007/247/trest-legendy-i-fakty.html_2020-05-26&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Мemorial ==
In 1921, near the Russian cemetery of the Turkish city of Gelibolu, on the European shore of the Dardanelles, the memorial in the form of a stone mound was opened by Kutepov leadership together with the other ranks of the Russian Army and blessed by the Russian Orthodox Church. When the army left the Gallipoli camp, the cemetery and memorial were solemnly transferred to the care of the local administration. After the earthquake of 1949, the mound was severely destroyed and later demolished. In 1961, a copy of the Gallipoli monument was restored at the Russian cemetery of Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois, near which the symbolic grave of General Kutepov is located. When the remains of General Kutepov are found, according to one version located near Paris, they will be buried in the grave reserved for the general.
In 2008, the memorial was restored and again solemnly consecrated by the Russian Orthodox Church.

<text>Prince Charles Ferdinand Vasa (; 13 October 1613 in Warsaw – 9 May 1655 in Wyszków), was a Polish prince, priest, Bishop of Wrocław from 1625, bishop of Płock from 1640 and Duke of Opole from 1648 to 1655.

==Biography==
Charles Ferdinand was the fourth son of King Sigismund III Vasa and his wife Constance of Austria and the brother of John Casimir, John Albert, Alexander Charles and Anna Catherine Constance. Charles Ferdinand spent his childhood and youth in the care of his mother at the royal court in Warsaw. On 23 March 1624 he received dispensation from Pope Urban VIII, allowing him to take the dignity of being a canon in Wrocław. In this case, cardinal-protector Cosmo de Torres intervened with the pope.

On 3 May 1625, through the political efforts of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, he was appointed the Bishop of Wrocław. On 22 October 1625 he received papal approval for the post. On 18 January 1626, despite being a minor (12 years old) and not having a proper ordination ceremony he was officially installed as bishop.

In 1629, he added the Prudnik district to the Diocese of Wrocław (before that, Prudnik was a part of the Olomouc Diocese). After the death of his mother in 1631, together with his brother John Casimir he inherited the wealthy city of Żywiec in Lesser Poland. During the reign of Władysław IV, Charles Ferdinand resided mainly in Warsaw. Being a close relative of the royal court, however, he was not interested in politics and had no ambition to acquire the secular authorities. Between 1632 and 1648 he devoted his time mostly to administrative work, financial affairs and accumulation of ecclesiastical benefice. In 1640 he was appointed the Bishop of Płock. After his coming of age, Charles Ferdinand decided never to accept the ordination of priesthood and gave the control of the Archdiocese of Wrocław to other influential bishops and priests that would be in charge like Bishop John von Balthasar Liesch Hornau and Archdeacon Peter Gebauer. Similarly, with the Archdiocese of Płock, he gave control over the sect to Stanisław Starczewski and Wojciech Tolibowski

After the death of King Władysław IV Vasa in 1648, he was a candidate to the Polish throne, together with his brother John Casimir whom he supported. Later he has launched a tough policy and decisive steps to quell the civil war in Polish occupied Ruthenia and Ukraine. He received the support of two-thirds majority of senators and bishops in the Polish Sejm (Parliament). Most notably he was supported by the Ruthenian nobles led by Jeremi Wiśniowiecki, however, his policies were opposed by the Protestants, Lutherans and by the nobility of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which feared the tightening of the Counter-Reformation. At the forefront of opposition to Charles Ferdinand Vasa stood Janusz Radziwiłł and his brother Bogusław Radziwiłł, who even threatened to break the Polish-Lithuanian union.

After losing the election, Charles Ferdinand received, from his brother and newly elected king, the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz. He then retired from public life. He settled on the estates of the bishops in Płock, in Mazovia. His main residence was a large renaissance castle in Brok. In 1651, he took care of the orphaned and deprived of estates in Ruthenia, Michael Korybut Wiśniowiecki (later King Michael I). Vasa financed his travels abroad and provided thorough education and studies in the best schools of Europe.

Charles Ferdinand Vasa died on 9 May 1655 in Wyszków. He was buried in the Jesuit Church in Warsaw.

Charles Ferdinand Vasa left a huge fortune and the majority of it was spent on various foundations of churches in the country. The rest was inherited by his brother John II Casimir. Money and estates inherited from the king&#x27;s brother helped to finance the troops and the military during the Polish-Swedish War (known as the &quot;Deluge&quot;), and the Duchy of Silesia provided the king with shelter when he had to flee Poland in 1655.

Charles Ferdinand was a great patron of art and supporter of the Society of Jesus (he had an enormous silver altar built for the Jesuit Church in Warsaw). In the 1640s, royal architect, Giovanni Battista Gisleni built for him a palace situated on the northern bastion of the Warsaw Royal Castle fortifications. It was later ransacked and destroyed by Swedes and Germans of Brandenburg in 1650s, during the Deluge. He also had a large wooden palace in Wyszków.

<doc id="1263497" wikidata="Q14126" url="?curid=1263497" title="Mataram (city)">
<text>Mataram (Indonesian: &quot;Kota Mataram&quot;) is a city and the capital of the Indonesian province of West Nusa Tenggara. The city is surrounded on all the landward sides by (but is not administratively part of) West Lombok Regency and lies on the western side of the island of Lombok, Indonesia. It is also the largest city of the province, and had a population of 402,843 at the 2010 Census and 429,651 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 441,147 (comprising 219,625 males and 221,522 females). 

The city is an economic, cultural, and education center of the province. It hosts all public universities in the province, the main airport as well as the only international airport in the province, and also main government offices. Greater Mataram Area (Indonesian: &quot;Mataram Raya&quot;) or sometimes also called Gumi Rinjani Metropolitan Area is a metropolitan area surrounding the city with a total population of around 3 million people on 2015, making it one of the largest in the Lesser Sunda Islands along with Denpasar metropolitan area in Bali.

== History ==
There was a small city called Selaparang in East Lombok, which was a centre of Sasak power in Lombok from the 16th to the 17th century AD. West Lombok was under the control of Balinese rajas, based on their states of Mataram and Cakranegara, until the island was invaded and occupied by the Dutch in 1894.

== Geography ==
The modern city is an urban sprawl in the middle of West Lombok, composed of three contiguous towns which were formerly separate but now share a single administration. The old port town of Ampenan in the west merges into the administrative centre of Mataram and this in turn merges into the commercial town of Cakranegara. Further east still lies the district of Sweta, the location of Lombok&#x27;s biggest market as well as Lombok&#x27;s bus terminal. The towns are linked by a wide, 8km-long one-way street which begins as Jalan Langko in Apenan, becomes Jalan Pejanggik in Mataram and finishes as Jalan Selaparang in Cakranegara; it then continues east as the principal cross-island highway to Labuhan Lombok and then Kayangan, site of the Lombok-Sumbawa ferry.

== Governance ==

=== Administrative division ===
The city consists of six districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the number of administrative villages (all classed as urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;, also called &quot;kampungs&quot;) in each district, and its postal codes.

Notes: (a) Except the kampungs of Ampenan Tengah (postcode 83112), Pejeruk (postcode 83113), Ampenan Selatan (postcode 83114) and Ampenan Utara (postcode 83511). (b) Except the &quot;kampung&quot; of Pagutan (postcode 83117).
== Demographics ==
=== Ethnicity ===
The Sasak people are the indigenous people of Lombok and form the majority of Mataram&#x27;s residents. Mataram is also home to people of Balinese, Javanese, Tionghoa-Peranakan people of mixed Indonesian and Chinese descent and a small number of Arab Indonesian people, mainly of Yemeni descent who arrived when the city was known as &quot;Ampenan&quot;. Despite being urban dwellers, the Sasak people of Mataram still identify strongly with their origins and the Sasak culture.

=== Religion ===
Islam is the religion of over 82% of the population of Mataram. Hinduism has the second largest following with 13% of the population. Other religions practised in Mataram are Christianity, Buddhism, and Confucianism.

=== Language ===
Mataram society normally speaks the Sasak language, &quot;Bahasa Sasak&quot;, which is the native language of the indigenous people of Lombok. Indonesian is the language most widely used in formal business, education and government contexts. When at home or a place of recreation, Mataram residents tend to use the Mataram Sasak language. There is also a large community of Balinese speakers in the city, as in the past Mataram was a colony and center of government for the Karangasem kingdom of Bali.

<text>Fulton Street is a long east–west street in northern Brooklyn, New York City. This street begins at the intersection of Adams Street and Joralemon Street in Brooklyn Heights, and runs eastward to East New York and Cypress Hills. At the border with Queens, Fulton Street becomes 91st Avenue, which ends at 84th Street in Woodhaven.

==History==
The street is named after Robert Fulton; a street of the same name in Manhattan was linked to this street by Fulton with his steam ferries. For a hundred years before the Fulton Ferry monopoly, Fulton Street was the Ferry Road through Jamaica Pass and, in the centuries before any ferry service, Indian path to the Hempstead Plains. It began at the Fulton Ferry Landing and climbed south through Brooklyn Heights past Brooklyn Borough Hall to where it now begins at Adams Street. Part of the original Fulton Street survives as Old Fulton Street in Brooklyn Heights and Dumbo, and as Cadman Plaza West in Downtown Brooklyn. The segment of Fulton Street that traveled past Borough Hall has been turned into a pedestrian esplanade.

==Route==

The initial segment of Fulton Street as it exists today is the Fulton Mall between Adams Street and Flatbush Avenue. East of Flatbush Avenue, Fulton Street becomes a major artery of Downtown Brooklyn, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill. At Franklin Avenue, Fulton Street then becomes the signature street of Bedford–Stuyvesant. At Broadway Junction in East New York, the street is interrupted by the intersection of Broadway and Jamaica Avenue, but continues on the other side as a one-way residential street through East New York and Cypress Hills until Norwood Avenue, once again as a two-way street reaching the Queens border at Elderts Lane in Woodhaven, Queens. There it becomes 91st Avenue, which continues until 84th Street in Queens.

On March 10, 2005, Fulton Street was co-named Harriet Ross Tubman Avenue along most of its length from Rockaway Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant to Elm Place in Downtown Brooklyn, on the anniversary of the death of the ex-slave and abolitionist, which has been designated &quot;Harriet Tubman Day of Commemoration&quot; in New York State.

==Transportation==
Fulton Street is served by the following subway lines: 
* The elevated BMT Fulton Street Line used to run over Fulton Street. The New York City Subway&#x27;s IND Fulton Street subway line () has replaced it east of Washington Avenue.

==Fulton Mall==

Fulton Mall is a pedestrian street and transit mall in Downtown Brooklyn that runs on Fulton Street between Flatbush Avenue and Adams Street. It contains 230 stores and dedicated bus lanes. For the mall&#x27;s length, only buses, commercial vehicles, local truck deliveries, and emergency vehicles are allowed to use the street. The center of the mall is an open public space known as Albee Square.

=== History ===

Fulton Street&#x27;s first period of great vigor occurred before the era of enclosed shopping malls, the era when huge department stores like Abraham &amp; Straus, Frederick Loeser &amp; Co. and A. I. Namm &amp; Son reigned on the street. The current era dates from the 1970s, when through the persistent efforts of the street’s merchants, the city agreed to a revitalization program through which it would narrow the roadway, widen the sidewalk, and create, with the exception of buses, a traffic-free shopping area. Architect Lee Harris Pomeroy redesigned the mall in the early 1980s: he designed street furniture and equipment for the project including large, free-standing canopies, vendors’ kiosks, directory and telephone kiosks, and high mast lighting. The graphics program he also designed for the project consists of informational, directional and street signage. Pomeroy&#x27;s renovation was completed in 1984 for $24 million and received an Albert S. Bard Award from the City Club of New York. Nonetheless, the mall initially failed to attract tenants. In 2024, the city began renovating Fulton Mall again for $8 million, adding benches and trees.

Subway stations at , , , , and and bus lines service the Fulton Mall area. The area is New York City&#x27;s third-largest commercial center after Herald Square and a stretch of Madison Avenue. The mall has attracted major investments from prominent Brooklyn retail real estate developers such as Stanley Chera, Albert Laboz, Joseph Jemal, Raymond M. Chera, and Eli Gindi.

=== Developments ===
Fulton Mall includes major retailers such as Macy&#x27;s, H&amp;M, Gap, GameStop, Foot Locker, Modell&#x27;s Sporting Goods, and Finish Line. The Fulton Mall Improvement Association is the local business improvement district. According to the Improvement Association, in 2003 the Fulton Mall area saw between 100,000 and 125,000 visitors a day. The mall has spurred additional commercial development in its immediate vicinity, such as the City Point development, and has become the most expensive place to do business in downtown Brooklyn. Fulton Street&#x27;s retail space was $301 per square foot in 2016 and $326 per square foot in 2017.

The Macy&#x27;s store at 422 Fulton Street was originally Abraham &amp; Straus&#x27;s flagship store. The building was designed in Art Deco style by Starrett &amp; Van Vleck and built in 1933. It was formerly the showroom for the W.C. Vosburgh Mfg. Co. As of 2017, the building is undergoing a $194 million renovation by Tishman Speyer. Its new portion will have 10 floors dedicated to Class A office space. Macy&#x27;s is also renovating its part of the building.

The Offerman Building on Fulton Mall was built in 1893 by Henry Offerman, a businessman in the sugar industry. It was designed in the Romanesque Revival architectural style and originally hosted retail on the ground floor. The Offerman Building was designated a New York City Historic Landmark in 2005, and by 2017 had been converted into a 121-unit residential complex. Across the street is another designated city landmark, the A. I. Namm &amp; Son Department Store.

<doc id="1263514" wikidata="Q702758" url="?curid=1263514" title="History of the Jews in France">
<text>The history of the Jews in France deals with Jews and Jewish communities in France since at least the Early Middle Ages. France was a centre of Jewish learning in the Middle Ages, but persecution increased over time, including multiple expulsions and returns. During the French Revolution in the late 18th century, on the other hand, France was the first European country to emancipate its Jewish population. Antisemitism still occurred in cycles and reached a high in the 1890s, as shown during the Dreyfus affair, and in the 1940s, under Nazi occupation and the Vichy regime.

Before 1919, most French Jews lived in Paris, with many being very proud to be fully assimilated into French culture, and they comprised an upscale subgroup. A more traditional Judaism was based in Alsace-Lorraine, which was recovered by The German Empire in 1871 and taken by France in 1918 following World War I. In addition, numerous Jewish refugees and immigrants came from Russia and eastern and central Europe in the early 20th century, changing the character of French Judaism in the 1920s and 1930s. These new arrivals were much less interested in assimilation into French culture. Some supported such new causes as Zionism, the Popular Front and communism, the latter two being popular among the French political left.

During World War II, the Vichy government collaborated with Nazi occupiers to deport a large number of both French Jews and foreign Jewish refugees to concentration camps. By the war&#x27;s end, 25% of the Jewish population of France had been murdered in the Holocaust, though this was a lower proportion than in most other countries under Nazi occupation.

In the 21st century, France has the largest Jewish population in Europe and the third-largest Jewish population in the world (after Israel and the United States). The Jewish community in France is estimated to number 480,000–550,000, depending in part on the definition being used. French Jewish communities are concentrated in the metropolitan areas of Paris, which has the largest Jewish population among all European cities (277,000), Marseille, with a population of 70,000, Lyon, Nice, Strasbourg and Toulouse.

The majority of French Jews in the 21st century are Sephardi and Mizrahi North African Jews, many of whom (or their parents) emigrated from former French colonies of North Africa after those countries gained independence in the 1950s and 1960s. They span a range of religious affiliations, from the ultra-Orthodox Haredi communities to the large segment of Jews who are entirely secular and who often marry outside the Jewish community.

Approximately 200,000 French Jews live in Israel. Since 2010 or so, more have been making aliyah in response to rising antisemitism in France.

==Roman and Merovingian periods==
According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; (1906), &quot;The first settlements of Jews in Europe are obscure. From 163 BCE there is evidence of Jews in Rome [...]. In the year 6 C.E. there were Jews at Vienne and Gallia Celtica; in the year 39 at Lugdunum (i.e. Lyon)&quot;.

An early account praised Hilary of Poitiers (died 366) for having fled from the Jewish society. The emperors Theodosius II and Valentinian III sent a decree to Amatius, prefect of Gaul (9 July 425), that prohibited Jews and pagans from practising law or holding public offices (&quot;militandi&quot;). This was to prevent Christians from being subject to them and possibly incited to change their faith. At the funeral of Hilary, Bishop of Arles, in 449, Jews and Christians mingled in crowds and wept; the former were said to have sung psalms in Hebrew.

In the sixth century, Jews were documented in Marseilles, Arles, Uzès, Narbonne, Clermont-Ferrand, Orléans, Paris, and Bordeaux. These cities had generally been centers of ancient Roman administration and were located on the great commercial routes. The Jews built synagogues in these cities. In harmony with the Theodosian code, and according to an edict of 331 by the emperor Constantine, the Jews were organized for religious purposes as they were in the Roman empire. They appear to have had priests (rabbis or ḥazzanim), archisynagogues, patersynagogues, and other synagogue officials. The Jews worked principally as merchants, as they were prohibited from owning land; they also served as tax collectors, sailors, and physicians.

They probably remained under Roman law until the triumph of Christianity, with the status established by Caracalla, on a footing of equality with their fellow citizens. Their association with fellow citizens was generally amicable, even after the establishment of Christianity in Gaul. The Christian clergy participated in some Jewish feasts; intermarriage between Jews and Christians sometimes occurred; and the Jews made proselytes. Worried about Christians adopting Jewish religious customs, the third Council of Orléans (539) warned the faithful against Jewish &quot;superstitions&quot;, and ordered them to abstain from traveling on Sunday and from adorning their persons or dwellings on that day. In the 6th century, a Jewish community thrived in Paris. They built a synagogue on the Île de la Cité, but it was later torn down by Christians, who erected a church on the site.

In 629, King Dagobert proposed the expulsion of all Jews who would not accept Christianity. No mention of the Jews was found from his reign to that of Pepin the Short. The Jews on the other hand continued to dwell and to prosper in what is now Southern France, then known as Septimania and a dependency of the Visigothic kings of Spain. From this epoch (689) dates the earliest known inscription relating to the Jews of France, the &quot;Funerary Stele of Justus, Matrona and Dulciorella&quot; of Narbonne, written in Latin and Hebrew. The Jews of Narbonne, chiefly merchants, were popular among the people who often rebelled against the Visigothic kings.

==Carolingian period==
The presence of Jews in France under Charlemagne is documented, with their position being regulated by law. Exchanges with the Orient strongly declined with the presence of Arabs in the Mediterranean sea. Trading and importing of oriental products such as gold, silk, black pepper or papyrus almost disappeared under the Carolingians. The Radhanite Jewish traders were nearly the only group to maintain trade between the Occident and the Orient.

Charlemagne fixed a formula for the Jewish oath to the state. He allowed Jews to enter into lawsuits with Christians. They were not allowed to require Christians to work on Sundays. Jews were not allowed to trade in currency, wine, or grain. Legally, Jews belonged to the emperor and could be tried only by him. But the numerous provincial councils which met during Charlemagne&#x27;s reign were not concerned with the Jewish communities.

Louis the Pious (ruled 814–840), faithful to the principles of his father Charlemagne, granted strict protection to Jews, whom he respected as merchants. Like his father, Louis believed that &#x27;the Jewish question&#x27; could be solved with the gradual conversion of Jews; according to medievalist scholar J. M. Wallace-Hadrill, some people believed this tolerance threatened the Christian unity of the Empire, which led to the strengthening of the Bishops at the expense of the Emperor. Saint Agobard of Lyon (779–841) had many run-ins with the Jews of France. He wrote about how rich and powerful they were becoming. Scholars such as Jeremy Cohen suggest that Saint Agobard&#x27;s belief in Jewish power contributed to his involvement in violent revolutions attempting to dethrone Louis the Pious in the early 830s. Lothar and Agobard&#x27;s entreaties to Pope Gregory IV gained them papal support for the overthrow of Emperor Louis. Upon Louis the Pious&#x27; return to power in 834, he deposed Saint Agobard from his see, to the consternation of Rome. There were unsubstantiated rumors in this period that Louis&#x27; second wife Judith was a converted Jew, as she would not accept the &quot;ordinatio&quot; for their first child.

Jews were engaged in export trade, particularly traveling to Palestine under Charlemagne. When the Normans disembarked on the coast of Narbonnese Gaul, they were taken for Jewish merchants. One authority said the Jewish traders boasted about buying whatever they pleased from bishops and abbots. Isaac the Jew, who was sent by Charlemagne in 797 with two ambassadors to Harun al-Rashid, the fifth Abbasid Caliph, was probably one of these merchants. He was said to have asked the Baghdad caliph for a rabbi to instruct the Jews whom he had allowed to settle at Narbonne (see History of the Jews in Babylonia).

==Capetians==
===Persecutions (987–1137)===

There were widespread persecutions of Jews in France beginning in 1007 or 1009. These persecutions, instigated by Robert II (972–1031), King of France (987–1031), called &quot;the Pious&quot;, are described in a Hebrew pamphlet, which also states that the King of France conspired with his vassals to destroy all the Jews on their lands who would not accept baptism, and many were put to death or killed themselves. Robert is credited with advocating forced conversions of local Jewry, as well as mob violence against Jews who refused. Among the dead was the learned Rabbi Senior. Robert the Pious is well known for his lack of religious tolerance and for the hatred which he bore toward heretics; it was Robert who reinstated the Roman imperial custom of burning heretics at the stake. In Normandy under Richard II, Duke of Normandy, Rouen Jewry suffered from persecutions that were so terrible that many women, in order to escape the fury of the mob, jumped into the river and drowned. A notable of the town, Jacob b. Jekuthiel, a Talmudic scholar, sought to intercede with Pope John XVIII to stop the persecution in Lorraine (1007). Jacob undertook the journey to Rome, but was imprisoned with his wife and four sons by Duke Richard, and escaped death only by allegedly miraculous means. He left his eldest son, Judah, as a hostage with Richard while he and his wife and three remaining sons went to Rome. He bribed the pope with seven gold marks and two hundred pounds, who thereupon sent a special envoy to King Robert ordering him to stop the persecutions.

If Adhémar of Chabannes, who wrote in 1030, is to be believed (he had a reputation as a fabricator), the anti-Jewish feelings arose in 1010 after Western Jews addressed a letter to their Eastern coreligionists warning them of a military movement against the Saracens. According to Adémar, Christians urged by Pope Sergius IV were shocked by the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem by the Muslims in 1009. After the destruction, European reaction to the rumor of the letter was of shock and dismay, Cluniac monk Rodulfus Glaber blamed the Jews for the destruction. In that year Alduin, Bishop of Limoges (bishop 990–1012), offered the Jews of his diocese the choice between baptism and exile. For a month theologians held disputations with the Jews, but without much success, for only three or four of Jews abjured their faith; others killed themselves; and the rest either fled or were expelled from Limoges. Similar expulsions took place in other French towns. By 1030, Rodulfus Glaber knew more concerning this story. According to his 1030 explanation, Jews of Orléans had sent to the East through a beggar a letter that provoked the order for the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Glaber adds that, on the discovery of the crime, the expulsion of the Jews was everywhere decreed. Some were driven out of the cities, others were put to death, while some killed themselves; only a few remained in the &quot;Roman world&quot;. Count Paul Riant (1836–1888) says that this whole story of the relations between the Jews and the Mohammedans is only one of those popular legends with which the chronicles of the time abound.

Another violent commotion arose at about 1065. At this date Pope Alexander II wrote to Béranger, Viscount of Narbonne and to Guifred, bishop of the city, praising them for having prevented the massacre of the Jews in their district, and reminding them that God does not approve of the shedding of blood. In 1065 also, Alexander admonished Landulf VI of Benevento &quot;that the conversion of Jews is not to be obtained by force.&quot; Also in the same year, Alexander called for a crusade against the Moors in Spain.

====Franco-Jewish literature====
During this period, which continued until the First Crusade, Jewish culture flourished in the South and North of France. The initial interest included poetry, which was at times purely liturgical, but which more often was a simple scholastic exercise without aspiration, destined rather to amuse and instruct than to move. Following this came Biblical exegesis, the simple interpretation of the text, with neither daring nor depth, reflecting a complete faith in traditional interpretation, and based by preference on the &quot;Midrashim&quot;, despite their fantastic character. Finally, and above all, their attention was occupied with the Talmud and its commentaries. The text of this work, together with that of the writings of the &quot;Geonim&quot;, particularly their &quot;responsa&quot;, was first revised and copied; then these writings were treated as a &quot;corpus juris&quot;, and were commented upon and studied both as a pious exercise in dialectics and from the practical point of view. While most of the focus of Jewish authors was religious, they did discuss other subjects, like the papal presence in their communities.

====Rashi====
The great Jewish figure who dominated the second half of the 11th century, as well as the whole rabbinical history of France, was Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki) of Troyes (1040–1105). He personified the genius of northern French Judaism: its devoted attachment to tradition; its untroubled faith; its piety, ardent but free from mysticism. His works are distinguished by their clarity, directness, and are written in a simple, concise, unaffected style, suited to his subject. His commentary on the Talmud, which was the product of colossal labor, and which eclipsed the similar works of all his predecessors, by its clarity and soundness made the study of that vast compilation easy, and soon became its indispensable complement. Every edition of the Talmud that was ever published has this commentary printed on the same page of the Talmud itself. His commentary on the Bible (particularly on the Pentateuch), a sort of repertory of the &quot;Midrash&quot;, served for edification, but also advanced the taste for seeking the plain and true meaning of the bible. The school which he founded at Troyes, his birthplace, after having followed the teachings of those of Worms and Mainz, immediately became famous. Around his chair were gathered Simḥah b. Samuel, R. Shamuel b. Meïr (Rashbam), and Shemaya, his grandsons; likewise Shemaria, Judah b. Nathan, and Isaac Levi b. Asher, all of whom continued his work. The school&#x27;s Talmudic commentaries and interpretations are the basis and starting point for the Ashkenazic tradition of how to interpret and understand the Talmud&#x27;s explanation of Biblical laws. In many cases, these interpretations differ substantially from those of the Sephardim, which results in differences between how Ashkenazim and Sephardim hold what constitutes the practical application of the law. In his Biblical commentaries, he availed himself of the works of his contemporaries. Among them must be cited Moses ha-Darshan, chief of the school of Narbonne, who was perhaps the founder of exegetical studies in France, and Menachem b. Ḥelbo. Thus the 11th century was a period of fruitful activity in literature. Thenceforth French Judaism became one of the poles within Judaism.

===The Crusades===

The Jews of France suffered during the First Crusade (1096), when the crusaders are stated, for example, to have shut up the Jews of Rouen in a church and to have murdered them without distinction of age or sex, sparing only those who accepted baptism. According to a Hebrew document, the Jews throughout France were at that time in great fear and wrote to their brothers in the Rhine countries making known to them their terror and asking them to fast and pray. In the Rhineland, thousands of Jews were killed by the crusaders (see German Crusade, 1096).

Jews did not have an active role in the Crusades, like Muslims and Christians did. Instead, Jews feared for their lives, as expulsions and anti-Jewish sentiment was on the rise in Western Europe. In 1256, around 3000 Jews were murdered in the French cities of Bretagne, Anjou, and Poitou. The violence and hatred spread by the pope encouraging violence led to the persecution of Jews in France. Many Jews fled to Narbonne, a city on the southwest coast of the country, which had long been a safe haven and center for Jewish life. The southern coast was more tolerant of Jewish life than the northern half of the country.

===Expulsions and Returns===
====Expulsion from France, 1182====

The First Crusade led to nearly a century of accusations (blood libel) against the Jews, many of whom were burned or attacked in France. Immediately after the coronation of Philip Augustus on 14 March 1181, the King ordered the Jews arrested on a Saturday, in all their synagogues, and despoiled of their money and their investments. In the following April 1182, he published an edict of expulsion, but according to the Jews a delay of three months for the sale of their personal property. Immovable property, however, such as houses, fields, vines, barns, and wine presses, he confiscated. The Jews attempted to win over the nobles to their side but in vain. In July they were compelled to leave the royal domains of France (and not the whole kingdom); their synagogues were converted into churches. These successive measures were simply expedients to fill the royal coffers. The goods confiscated by the king were at once converted into cash.

During the century which terminated so disastrously for the Jews, their condition was not altogether bad, especially if compared with that of their brethren in Germany. Thus may be explained the remarkable intellectual activity which existed among them, the attraction that it exercised over the Jews of other countries, and the numerous works produced in those days. The impulse given by Rashi to study did not cease with his death; his successors—the members of his family first among them—continued his work. Research moved within the same limits as in the preceding century, and dealt mainly with the Talmud, rabbinical jurisprudence, and Biblical exegesis.

====Recalled by Philip Augustus, 1198====
This century, which opened with the return of the Jews to France proper (then almost reduced to the Île de France), closed with their complete exile from the country in a larger sense. In July 1198, Philip Augustus, &quot;contrary to the general expectation and despite his own edict, recalled the Jews to Paris and made the churches of God suffer great persecutions&quot; (Rigord). The king adopted this measure from no good will toward the Jews, for he had shown his true sentiments a short time before in the Bray affair. But since then he had learned that the Jews could be an excellent source of income from a fiscal point of view, especially as money-lenders. Not only did he recall them to his estates, but he gave state sanction by his ordinances to their operations in banking and pawnbroking. He placed their business under control, determined the legal rate of interest, and obliged them to have seals affixed to all their deeds. Naturally, this trade was taxed, and the affixing of the royal seal was paid for by the Jews. Henceforward there was in the treasury a special account called &quot;Produit des Juifs&quot;, and the receipts from this source increased continually. At the same time, it was in the interest of the treasury to secure possession of the Jews, considered a fiscal resource. The Jews were therefore made serfs of the king in the royal domain, just at a time when the charters, becoming wider and wider, tended to bring about the disappearance of serfdom. In certain respects their position became even harder than that of serfs, for the latter could in certain cases appeal to custom and were often protected by the Church; but there was no custom to which the Jews might appeal, and the Church laid them under its ban. The kings and the lords said &quot;my Jews&quot; just as they said &quot;my lands&quot;, and they disposed in like manner of the one and of the other. The lords imitated the king: &quot;they endeavored to have the Jews considered an inalienable dependence of their fiefs, and to establish the usage that if a Jew domiciled in one barony passed into another, the lord of his former domicil should have the right to seize his possessions.&quot; This agreement was made in 1198 between the king and the Count of Champagne in a treaty, the terms of which provided that neither should retain in his domains the Jews of the other without the latter&#x27;s consent and furthermore that the Jews should not make loans or receive pledges without the express permission of the king and the count. Other lords made similar conventions with the king. Thenceforth they too had a revenue known as the &quot;Produit des Juifs&quot;, comprising the taille, or annual quit-rent, the legal fees for the writs necessitated by the Jews&#x27; law trials, and the seal duty. A thoroughly characteristic feature of this fiscal policy is that the bishops (according to the agreement of 1204 regulating the spheres of ecclesiastical and seigniorial jurisdiction) continued to prohibit the clergy from excommunicating those who sold goods to the Jews or who bought from them.

The practice of &quot;retention treaties&quot; spread throughout France after 1198. Lords intending to impose a heavy tax (&quot;captio&quot;, literally &quot;capture&quot;) on Jews living in their lordship (&quot;dominium&quot;) signed treaties with their neighbours, whereby the latter refused to permit the former&#x27;s Jews entry into his domains, thus &quot;retaining&quot; them for the lord to tax. This practice arose in response to the common flight of Jews in the face of a &quot;captio&quot; to a different &quot;dominium&quot;, where they purchased the right to settle unmolested by gifts (bribes) to their new lord. In May 1210 the crown negotiated a series of treaties with the neighbours of the royal demesne and successfully &quot;captured&quot; its Jews with a large tax levy. From 1223 on, however, the Count Palatine of Champagne refused to sign any such treaties, and in that year, he even refused to affirm the crown&#x27;s asserted right to force non-retention policies on its barons. Such treaties became obsolete after Louis IX&#x27;s ordinance of Melun (1230), when it became illegal for a Jew to migrate between lordships. This ordinance—the first piece of public legislation in France since Carolingian times—also declared it treason to refuse non-retention.

====Under Louis VIII====

Louis VIII of France (1223–26), in his &quot;Etablissement sur les Juifs&quot; of 1223, while more inspired with the doctrines of the Church than his father, Philip Augustus, knew also how to look after the interests of his treasury. Although he declared that from 8 November 1223, the interest on Jews&#x27; debts should no longer hold good, he at the same time ordered that the capital should be repaid to the Jews in three years and that the debts due the Jews should be inscribed and placed under the control of their lords. The lords then collected the debts for the Jews, doubtless receiving a commission. Louis furthermore ordered that the special seal for Jewish deeds should be abolished and replaced by the ordinary one.

Twenty-six barons accepted Louis VIII&#x27;s new measures, but Theobald IV (1201–53), the powerful Count of Champagne, did not, since he had an agreement with the Jews that guaranteed their safety in return for extra income through taxation. Champagne&#x27;s capital at Troyes was where Rashi had lived a century before, and Champagne continued to have a prosperous Jewish population. Theobald IV would become a major opposition force to Capetian dominance, and his hostility was manifest during the reign of Louis VIII. For example, during the siege of Avignon, he performed only the minimum service of 40 days and left for home amid charges of treachery.
====Under Louis IX====
In spite of all these restrictions designed to restrain, if not to suppress moneylending, Louis IX of France (1226–70) (also known as Saint Louis), with his ardent piety and his submission to the Catholic Church, unreservedly condemned loans at interest. He was less amenable than Philip Augustus to fiscal considerations. Despite former conventions, in an assembly held at Melun in December 1230, he compelled several lords to sign an agreement not to authorize Jews to make any loan. No one in the whole Kingdom of France was allowed to detain a Jew belonging to another, and each lord might recover a Jew who belonged to him, just as he might his own serf (&quot;tanquam proprium servum&quot;), wherever he might find him and however long a period had elapsed since the Jew had settled elsewhere. At the same time, the ordinance of 1223 was enacted afresh, which only proves that it had not been carried into effect. Both king and lords were forbidden to borrow from Jews.

In 1234, Louis freed his subjects from a third of their registered debts to Jews (including those who had already paid their debts), but debtors had to pay the remaining two-thirds within a specified time. It was also forbidden to imprison Christians or to sell their real estate to recover debts owed to Jews. The king wished in this way to strike a deadly blow at usury.

In 1243, Louis ordered, at the urging of Pope Gregory IX, the burning in Paris of some 12,000 manuscript copies of the Talmud and other Jewish works.

In order to finance his first Crusade, Louis ordered the expulsion of all Jews engaged in usury and the confiscation of their property, for use in his crusade, but the order for the expulsion was only partly enforced if at all. Louis left for the Seventh Crusade in 1248.

However, he did not cancel the debts owed by Christians. Later, Louis became conscience-stricken, and, overcome by scruples, he feared lest the treasury, by retaining some part of the interest paid by the borrowers, might be enriched with the product of usury. As a result, one-third of the debts was forgiven, but the other two-thirds were to be remitted to the royal treasury.

In 1251, while Louis was in captivity on the Crusade, a popular movement rose up with the intention of traveling to the east to rescue him; although they never made it out of northern France, Jews were subject to their attacks as they wandered throughout the country (see Shepherds&#x27; Crusade).

In 1257 or 1258 (&quot;Ordonnances&quot;, i. 85), wishing, as he says, to provide for his safety of soul and peace of conscience, Louis issued a mandate for the restitution in his name of the amount of usurious interest which had been collected on the confiscated property, the restitution to be made either to those who had paid it or to their heirs.

Later, after having discussed the subject with his son-in-law, King Theobald II of Navarre and Count of Champagne, Louis decided on 13 September 1268 to arrest Jews and seize their property. But an order which followed close upon this last (1269) shows that on this occasion also Louis reconsidered the matter. Nevertheless, at the request of Paul Christian (Pablo Christiani), he compelled the Jews, under penalty of a fine, to wear at all times the &quot;rouelle&quot; or badge decreed by the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215. This consisted of a piece of red felt or cloth cut in the form of a wheel, four fingers in circumference, which had to be attached to the outer garment at the chest and back.

==== The Medieval Inquisition ====

The Inquisition, which had been instituted in order to suppress Catharism, finally occupied itself with the Jews of Southern France who converted to Christianity. The popes complained that not only were baptized Jews returning to their former faith but that Christians also were being converted to Judaism. In March 1273, Pope Gregory X formulated the following rules: relapsed Jews, as well as Christians who abjured their faith in favor of &quot;the Jewish superstition&quot;, were to be treated by the Inquisitors as heretics. The instigators of such apostasies, as those who received or defended the guilty ones, were to be punished in the same way as the delinquents.

In accordance with these rules, the Jews of Toulouse, who had buried a Christian convert in their cemetery, were brought before the Inquisition in 1278 for trial, with their rabbi, Isaac Males, being condemned to the stake. Philip IV at first ordered his seneschals not to imprison any Jews at the instance of the Inquisitors, but in 1299 he rescinded this order.

====The Great Exile of 1306====
Toward the middle of 1306 the treasury was nearly empty, and the king, as he was about to do the following year in the case of the Templars, condemned the Jews to banishment, and took forcible possession of their property, real and personal. Their houses, lands, and movable goods were sold at auction; and for the king were reserved any treasures found buried in the dwellings that had belonged to the Jews. That Philip the Fair intended merely to fill the gap in his treasury, and was not at all concerned about the well-being of his subjects, is shown by the fact that he put himself in the place of the Jewish moneylenders and exacted from their Christian debtors the payment of their debts, which they themselves had to declare. Furthermore, three months before the sale of the property of the Jews the king took measures to ensure that this event should be coincident with the prohibition of clipped money, in order that those who purchased the goods should have to pay in undebased coin. Finally, fearing that the Jews might have hidden some of their treasures, he declared that one-fifth of any amount found should be paid to the discoverer. It was on 22 July, the day after &quot;Tisha B&#x27;Av&quot;, a Jewish fast day, that the Jews were arrested. In prison they received notice that they had been sentenced to exile; that, abandoning their goods and debts, and taking only the clothes which they had on their backs and the sum of 12 &quot;sous tournois&quot; each, they would have to quit the kingdom within one month. Speaking of this exile, a French historian has said,In striking at the Jews, Philip the Fair at the same time dried up one of the most fruitful sources of the financial, commercial, and industrial prosperity of his kingdom.

To a large extent, the history of the Jews of France ceased. The span of control of the King of France had increased considerably in extent. Outside the Île de France, it now comprised Champagne, the Vermandois, Normandy, Perche, Maine, Anjou, Touraine, Poitou, the Marche, Lyonnais, Auvergne, and Languedoc, reaching from the Rhône to the Pyrénées. The exiles could not take refuge anywhere except in Lorraine, the county of Burgundy, Savoy, Dauphiné, Roussillon, and a part of Provence—all regions located in Empire. It is not possible to estimate the number of fugitives; that given by Grätz, 100,000, has no foundation in fact.

====Return of the Jews to France, 1315====

Nine years had hardly passed since the expulsion of 1306 when Louis X of France (1314–16) recalled the Jews. In an edict dated 28 July 1315, he permitted them to return for a period of twelve years, authorizing them to establish themselves in the cities in which they had lived before their banishment. He issued this edict in answer to the demands of the people. Geoffrey of Paris, the popular poet of the time, says in fact that the Jews were gentle in comparison with the Christians who had taken their place, and who had flayed their debtors alive; if the Jews had remained, the country would have been happier; for there were no longer any moneylenders at all. The king probably had the interests of his treasury also in view. The profits of the former confiscations had gone into the treasury, and by recalling the Jews for only twelve years he would have an opportunity for ransoming them at the end of this period. It appears that they gave the sum of 122,500 &quot;livres&quot; for the privilege of returning. It is also probable, as Adolphe Vuitry states, that a large number of the debts owing to the Jews had not been recovered, and that the holders of the notes had preserved them; the decree of return specified that two-thirds of the old debts recovered by the Jews should go into the treasury. The conditions under which they were allowed to settle in the land are set forth in a number of articles; some of the guaranties which were accorded the Jews had probably been demanded by them and been paid for.

They were to live by the work of their hands or to sell merchandise of good quality; they were to wear the circular badge, and not discuss religion with laymen. They were not to be molested, either with regard to the chattels they had carried away at the time of their banishment, or with regard to the loans which they had made since then, or in general with regard to anything which had happened in the past. Their synagogues and their cemeteries were to be restored to them on condition that they would refund their value; or, if these could not be restored, the king would give them the necessary sites at a reasonable price. The books of the Law that had not yet been returned to them were also to be restored, with the exception of the Talmud. After the period of twelve years granted to them, the king might not expel the Jews again without giving them a year&#x27;s time in which to dispose of their property and carry away their goods. They were not to lend on usury, and no one was to be forced by the king or his officers to repay to them usurious loans.

If they engaged in pawnbroking, they were not to take more than two deniers in the pound a week; they were to lend only on pledges. Two men with the title &quot;auditors of the Jews&quot; were entrusted with the execution of this ordinance and were to take cognizance of all claims that might arise in connection with goods belonging to the Jews that had been sold before the expulsion for less than half of what was regarded as a fair price. The king finally declared that he took the Jews under his special protection and that he desired to have their persons and property protected from all violence, injury, and oppression.

====Expulsion of 1394====
On 17 September 1394, Charles VI suddenly published an ordinance in which he declared, in substance, that for a long time he had been taking note of the many complaints provoked by the excesses and misdemeanors which the Jews committed against Christians; and that the prosecutors, having made several investigations, had discovered many violations by the Jews of the agreement they had made with him. Therefore, he decreed as an irrevocable law and statute that thenceforth no Jew should dwell in his domains (&quot;Ordonnances&quot;, vii. 675). According to the Religieux de St. Denis, the king signed this decree at the insistence of the queen (&quot;Chron. de Charles VI.&quot; ii. 119). The decree was not immediately enforced, a respite being granted to the Jews in order that they might sell their property and pay their debts. Those indebted to them were enjoined to redeem their obligations within a set time; otherwise, their pledges held in pawns were to be sold by the Jews. The provost was to escort the Jews to the frontier of the kingdom. Subsequently, the king released the Christians from their debts.

==Provence==

Archaeological evidence has been discovered of a Jewish presence in Provence since at least the 1st century. The earliest documentary evidence for the presence of Jews dates from the middle of the 5th century in Arles. The Jewish presence reached a peak in 1348 when it probably numbered about 15,000.

Provence was not incorporated into France until 1481, and the expulsion edict of 1394 did not apply there. The privileges of the Jews of Provence were confirmed in 1482. However, from 1484, anti-Jewish disturbances broke out, with looting and violence perpetrated by laborers from outside the region hired for the harvest season. In some places, Jews were protected by the town officials, and they were declared to be under royal protection. However, a voluntary exodus began and was accelerated when similar disorders were repeated in 1485. According to Isidore Loeb, in a special study of the subject in the &quot;Revue des Études Juives&quot; (xiv. 162–183), about 3,000 Jews came to Provence after the Alhambra Decree expelled Jews from Spain in 1492.

From 1484, one town after another had called for expulsion, but the calls were rejected by Charles VIII. However, Louis XII, in one of his first acts as king in 1498, issued a general expulsion order for the Jews of Provence. Though not enforced at the time, the order was renewed in 1500 and again in 1501. On this occasion, it was definitively implemented. The Jews of Provence were given the option of conversion to Christianity and a number chose that option. However, after a short while—if only to compensate partially for the loss of revenues caused by the departure of the Jews—the king imposed a special tax, referred to as &quot;the tax of the neophytes.&quot; These converts and their descendants soon became the objects of social discrimination and slander.

During the second half of the 17th century, a number of Jews attempted to reestablish themselves in Provence. Before the French Revolution abolished the administrative entity of Provence, the first community outside the southwest, Alsace-Lorraine and Comtat Venaissin, was re-formed in Marseilles.

==Early modern period==
===17th century===

At the beginning of the 17th century, Jews began again to re-enter France. This resulted in a new edict of 23 April 1615 which forbade Christians, under the penalty of death and confiscation, to shelter Jews or to converse with them.

Alsace was home to a significant number of Jews. In annexing the region in 1648, the French government was at first inclined toward the banishment of Jews living in those provinces but thought better of it in view of the benefit he could derive from them. On 25 September 1675, Louis XIV granted these Jews letters patent, taking them under his special protection. This, however, did not prevent them from being subjected to every kind of extortion, and their position remained the same as it had been under the Austrian government.

In 1683, Louis XIV expelled Jews from the newly acquired colony of Martinique. The Regency was no less severe.

===Beginnings of emancipation===
In the course of the 18th century, the attitude of the authorities toward Jews became more tolerant and corrected previous legislation. The authorities often overlooked infractions of the edict of banishment; a colony of Portuguese and German Jews was tolerated in Paris. The voices of enlightened Christians who demanded justice for the proscribed people began to be heard.

By the 1780s there were about 40,000 to 50,000 Jews in France, chiefly centered in Bordeaux, Metz, and a few other cities. They had very limited rights and opportunities, apart from the money-lending business, but their status was not illegal. An Alsatian Jew named Cerfbeer, who had rendered great service to the French government as purveyor to the army, was the representative of the Jews before Louis XVI. The humane minister, Malesherbes, summoned a commission of Jewish notables to make suggestions for the amelioration of the condition of their coreligionists. The direct result of the efforts of these men was the abolition, in 1785, of the degrading poll-tax and the permission to settle in all parts of France. Shortly afterward the Jewish question was raised by two men of genius, who subsequently became prominent in the French Revolution—Count Mirabeau and the Abbé Grégoire—the former of whom, while on a diplomatic mission in Prussia, had made the acquaintance of Moses Mendelssohn and his school (see &quot;Haskalah&quot;), who were then working toward the intellectual emancipation of the Jews. In a pamphlet, &quot;Sur Moses Mendelssohn, sur la Réforme Politique des Juifs&quot; (London, 1787), Mirabeau refuted the arguments of the German antisemites like Michaelis and claimed for the Jews the full rights of citizenship. This pamphlet naturally provoked many writings for and against the Jews, and the French public became interested in the question. On the proposition of Roederer the Royal Society of Science and Arts of Metz offered a prize for the best essay in answer to the question: &quot;What are the best means to make the Jews happier and more useful in France?&quot; Nine essays, of which only two were unfavorable to the Jews, were submitted to the judgment of the learned assembly. Of the challenge, there were three winners: Abbé Gregoire, Claude-Antoine Thiery, and Zalkind Hourwitz.

==The Revolution and Napoleon==

The Sephardi Jews in Bordeaux and Bayonne, who were willing to trade in their communal rights in exchange for full citizenship, participated in 1789 in the election of the Estates-General but those in Alsace, Lorraine, and in Paris, many of them Ashkenazi reluctant to yield to the state their intra-communal privileges, were denied this right. Herz Cerfbeer, a French-Jewish financier, then asked to Jacques Necker and obtained the right for Jews from eastern France to elect their own delegates. Among them were the son of Cerfbeer, Theodore, and Joseph David Sinzheim. The Cahier written by the Jewish community from eastern France asked for the end of the discriminatory status and taxes targeting Jews.

The fall of the Bastille was the signal for disorders everywhere in France. In certain districts of Alsace the peasants attacked the dwellings of the Jews, who took refuge in Basel. A gloomy picture of the outrages upon them was sketched before the National Assembly (3 August) by the abbé Henri Grégoire, who demanded their complete emancipation. The National Assembly shared the indignation of the prelate, but left the question of emancipation undecided; it was intimidated by the deputies of Alsace, especially by Jean-François Rewbell.

On 22 December 1789, the Jewish question came again before the Assembly in debating the issue of admitting to public service all citizens without distinction of creed. Mirabeau, the abbé Grégoire, Robespierre, Duport, Barnave and the comte de Clermont-Tonnerre exerted all the power of their eloquence to bring about the desired emancipation; but the repeated disturbances in Alsace and the strong opposition of the deputies of that province and of the clericals, like La Fare, Bishop of Nancy, the abbé Maury, and others, caused the decision to be again postponed. Only the Portuguese and the Avignonese Jews, who had hitherto enjoyed all civil rights as naturalized Frenchmen, were declared full citizens by a majority of 150 on 28 January 1790. This partial victory infused new hope into the Jews of the German districts, who made still greater efforts in the struggle for freedom. They won over the eloquent advocate Godard, whose influence in revolutionary circles was considerable. Through his exertions the National Guards and the diverse sections pronounced themselves in favor of the Jews, and the abbé Malot was sent by the General Assembly of the Commune to plead their cause before the National Assembly. The grave affairs which absorbed the Assembly, the prolonged agitations in Alsace, and the passions of the clerical party kept in check the advocates of Jewish emancipation. A few days before the dissolution of the National Assembly (27 September 1791) a member of the Jacobin Club, formerly a parliamentary councilor, Duport, unexpectedly ascended the tribune and said,I believe that freedom of worship does not permit any distinction in the political rights of citizens on account of their creed. The question of the political existence of the Jews has been postponed. Still the Muslems and the men of all sects are admitted to enjoy political rights in France. I demand that the motion for postponement be withdrawn, and a decree passed that the Jews in France enjoy the privileges of full citizens.This proposition was accepted amid loud applause. Rewbell endeavored, indeed, to oppose the motion, but he was interrupted by Regnault de Saint-Jean, president of the Assembly, who suggested &quot;that every one who spoke against this motion should be called to order, because he would be opposing the constitution itself&quot;.

===During the Reign of Terror===
Judaism in France thus became, as the Alsatian deputy Schwendt wrote to his constituents, &quot;nothing more than the name of a distinct religion&quot;. However, in Alsace, especially in the Bas-Rhin the reactionaries did not cease their agitations and Jews were victims of discriminations. During the Reign of Terror, at Bordeaux, Jewish bankers, compromised in the cause of the Girondins, had to pay important fines or to run away to save their lives while some Jewish bankers (49 according to the Jewish Encyclopedia) were imprisoned at Paris as suspects and nine of them were executed. The decree of the convention by which the Catholic faith was annulled and replaced by the worship of Reason was applied by the provincial clubs, especially by those of the German districts, to the Jewish religion as well. Some synagogues were pillaged and the mayors of a few eastern towns (Strasbourg, Troyes, etc.) forbade the celebration of Sabbath (to apply the week of ten days).

Meanwhile, the French Jews gave proofs of their patriotism and of their gratitude to the land that had emancipated them. Many of them died in battle as part of the Army of the Republic while fighting the forces of Europe in coalition. To contribute to the war fund, candelabra of synagogues were sold, and wealthier Jews deprived themselves of their jewels to make similar contributions.

===Attitude of Napoleon===


Though the Revolution had begun the process of Jewish emancipation in France, Napoleon also spread the concept in the lands he conquered across Europe, liberating Jews from their ghettos and establishing relative equality for them. The net effect of his policies significantly changed the position of the Jews in Europe. Starting in 1806, Napoleon passed a number of measures supporting the position of the Jews in the French Empire, including assembling a representative group elected by the Jewish community, the Grand Sanhedrin. In conquered countries, he abolished laws restricting Jews to ghettos. In 1807, he added Judaism as an official religion of France, with previously sanctioned Roman Catholicism, and Lutheran and Calvinist Protestantism. Despite the positive effects, it is unclear however, whether Napoleon himself was disposed favorably towards the Jews, or merely saw them as a political or financial tool. On 17 March 1808, Napoleon rolled back some reforms by the so-called &quot;décret infâme&quot;, declaring all debts with Jews reduced, postponed, or annulled; this caused the Jewish community to nearly collapse. The decree also restricted where Jews could live, especially for those in the eastern French Empire, with all its annexations in the Rhineland and beyond (as of 1810), in hopes of assimilating them into society. Many of these restrictions were eased again in 1811 and finally abolished in 1818.

==After the Restoration==
The restoration of Louis XVIII did not materially change the political condition of the Jews. Enemies of the Jews cherished the hope that the Bourbons would hasten to undo the work of the Revolution with regard to Jewish emancipation, but were soon disappointed. The emancipation the French Jews had made enough progress that the clerical monarch could not find pretexts for curtailing their rights as citizens. They were no longer treated as poor, downtrodden peddlers or money-lenders with whom every petty official could do as he liked. Many of them already occupied high positions in the army and the magistracy, as well as in the arts and sciences.

===State recognition===
Of the faiths recognized by the state, only Judaism had to support its ministers, while those of the Catholic and Protestant churches were supported by the government. This legal inferiority was removed in 1831, thanks to the intervention of the Duke of Orléans, lieutenant-general of the kingdom, and to the campaign led in Parliament by the deputies comte de Rambuteau and Jean Viennet. Encouraged by these prominent men, the minister of education, on 13 November 1830, offered a motion to place Judaism upon an equal footing with Catholicism and Protestantism as regards support for the synagogues and for the rabbis from the public treasury. The motion was accompanied by flattering compliments to the French Jews, &quot;who&quot;, said the minister, &quot;since the removal of their disabilities by the Revolution, have shown themselves worthy of the privileges granted to them&quot;. After a short discussion the motion was adopted by a large majority. In January 1831, it passed in the Chamber of Peers by 89 votes to 57, and on 8 February it was ratified by King Louis Philippe, who from the beginning had shown himself favorable to placing Judaism on an equal footing with the other faiths. Shortly afterward the rabbinical college, which had been founded at Metz in 1829, was recognized as a state institution, and was granted a subsidy. The government likewise liquidated the debts contracted by various Jewish communities before the Revolution.

===Full equality===
Full equality did not occur until 1831. By the fourth decade of the nineteenth century, France provided an environment in which Jews took active and many times leading roles. The Napoleonic policy of &quot;carrières aux talents&quot;, or &#x27;careers for the gifted&#x27;, permitted French Jews to enter previously forbidden fields such as the arts, finance, trade, and government. For this they were never forgiven by primarily Royalist and Catholic antisemites.

===Assimilation===

While the Jews had become in other respects the equals of their Christian fellow citizens, the &quot;More Judaico&quot; oath continued to be administered to them, in spite of the repeated protestations of both the rabbis and the consistory. It was only in 1846, owing to a brilliant defense speech by the Jewish lawyer Adolphe Crémieux before the Court of Nîmes in defense of a rabbi who had refused to take this oath, and to a valuable essay on the subject by Martin, a prominent Christian trial lawyer from Strasburg, that the Court of Cassation removed this last remnant of medieval legislation. With this act of justice the history of the Jews of France merges into the general history of the French people. The rapidity with which many of them won affluence and distinction in the nineteenth century is without parallel. In spite of the deep-rooted prejudices which prevailed in certain classes of French society, many of them occupied high positions in literature, art, science, jurisprudence, the army—indeed, in every walk of life. In 1860, the Alliance Israelite Universelle was formed &quot;to work everywhere for the emancipation and moral progress of the Jews; to offer effective assistance to Jews suffering from antisemitism; and to encourage all publications calculated to promote this aim.&quot;

The 1870 &quot;Crémieux decrees&quot; granted automatic French citizenship to the approximately 40,000 Jews of Algeria, at that time a French &quot;département&quot;, but not to their Muslim neighbors.

People of Jewish faith in France were becoming assimilated into their lives. After their Emancipation in 1791, Jews in France had new freedoms. For example, Jews were allowed to attend schools that were once delegated for just non-Jews. They were also allowed to pray in their own synagogues. Lastly, many Jews found themselves moving from the rural areas of France and into the big cities. In these big cities, Jews had new job opportunities and many were advancing up the economic ladder.
Although life was looking brighter for these Western Jews, some Jews who lived in Eastern Europe believed that the Emancipation in Western countries were causing Jews to lose their traditional beliefs and culture. As more and more Jews were becoming assimilated into their new lives, these Jews were breaking away from rabbinical law and rabbinical authority decreased. For example, some Jews were marrying outside of their religion and their children were growing up in homes where they were not being introduced to traditional beliefs and losing connection with their roots. Also, fewer and fewer Jews in these new urbanized Jewish homes were following the strict rules of Kosher laws. Many Jews were so preoccupied with assimilating and prospering in their new lives that they formed a new type of Judaism that would fit with the times. The Reform Movement came about to let Jews stay connected to their roots while also living their lives without so many restrictions.

===Antisemitism===
Alphonse Toussenel (1803–1885) was a political writer and zoologist who introduced antisemitism into French mainstream thinking. A utopian socialist and a disciple of Charles Fourier, he criticized the economic liberalism of the July Monarchy and denounced the ills of civilization: individualism, egoism, and class conflict. He was hostile to the Jews and also to the British. Toussenel&#x27;s &quot;Les juifs rois de l&#x27;époque, histoire de la féodalité financière&quot; (1845) argued that French finance and commerce was controlled by an alien Jewish presence, typified in the malign influence of the Rothschild banking family of France. Toussenel&#x27;s antisemitism was rooted in a revolutionary-nationalist interpretation reading of French history. He was innovative and using zoology as a vehicle for social criticism, and his natural history books, as much as his political writings, were infused with antisemitic and anti-English sentiments. For Toussenel, the English and the Jews represented external and internal threats to French national identity.

Antisemitism based on racism emerged in the 1880s led by Edouard Drumont, who founded the Antisemitic League of France in 1889, and was the founder and editor of the newspaper &quot;La Libre Parole&quot;. After spending years of research, he synthesized three major strands of antisemitism. The first strand was traditional Catholic attitudes toward the &quot;Christ killers&quot; augmented by vehement antipathy toward the French Revolution. The second strand was hostility to capitalism, of the sort promoted by the Socialist movement. The third strand was scientific racism, based on the argument that races have fixed characteristics, and the Jews have highly negative characteristics.

==Dreyfus affair==
The &quot;Dreyfus affair&quot; was a major political scandal that convulsed France from 1894 until its resolution in 1906, and which reverberated for decades longer. The affair is often seen as a modern and universal symbol of injustice for reasons of state and remains one of the most striking examples of a complex miscarriage of justice where the press and public opinion played a central role. The issue was blatant antisemitism as practiced by the Army and defended by traditionalists (especially Catholics) against secular and republican forces, including most Jews. In the end, the latter triumphed, albeit at a very high personal cost to Dreyfus himself.

The affair began in November 1894 with the conviction for treason of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a young French artillery officer of Alsatian Jewish descent. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for allegedly having communicated French military secrets to the German Embassy in Paris. Dreyfus was sent to the penal colony at Devil&#x27;s Island in French Guiana, where he spent almost five years.

Two years later, in 1896, evidence came to light identifying a French Army major named Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy as the real spy. High-ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence and a military court unanimously acquitted Esterhazy after the second day of his trial. The Army accused Dreyfus of additional charges based on false documents. Word of the military court&#x27;s framing of Dreyfus and of the attendant cover-up began to spread, chiefly owing to &quot;J&#x27;Accuse...!&quot;, a vehement open letter published in a Paris newspaper in January 1898 by the notable writer Émile Zola. Activists put pressure on the government to reopen the case.

In 1899, Dreyfus was returned to France for another trial. The intense political and judicial scandal that ensued divided French society between those who supported Dreyfus (now called &quot;Dreyfusards&quot;), such as Anatole France, Henri Poincaré and Georges Clemenceau, and those who condemned him (the anti-Dreyfusards), such as Édouard Drumont, the director and publisher of the antisemitic newspaper &quot;La Libre Parole&quot;. The new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10-year sentence but Dreyfus was pardoned and set free. All accusations against Alfred Dreyfus eventually were demonstrated to be baseless, and in 1906 Dreyfus was exonerated and reinstated as a major in the French Army.

The Affair from 1894 to 1906 divided France deeply and lastingly into two opposing camps: the pro-Army, mostly Catholic &quot;anti-Dreyfusards&quot; who generally lost the initiative to the anticlerical, pro-republican Dreyfusards. It embittered French politics and helped the radical party come to power.

==20th century==
The relatively small Jewish community was based in Paris, and very well established in the city&#x27;s business, financial, and intellectual elite. A third of Parisian bankers were Jewish, led by the Rothschild family, which also played a dominant role in the well organized Jewish community. Many of the most influential French intellectuals were nominally Jewish, including Henri Bergson, Lucien Lévy-Bruhl and Emile Durkheim. The Dreyfus affair to some degree rekindled their sense of being Jewish. Jews were prominent in art and culture, holding special prominence in the École de Paris art movement, typified by such artists as Modigliani, Pascin, Frenel, Soutine, and Chagall. The Jews considered themselves fully assimilated into French culture, for them Judaism was entirely a matter of religious belief, with minimal ethnic or cultural dimensions.

By the time Dreyfus was fully exonerated in 1906, antisemitism declined sharply and it declined again during the First World War, as a nation was aware that many Jews died fighting for France. The antisemitic newspaper &quot;La Libre Parole&quot; closed in 1924, and the former anti-Dreyfusard Maurice Barrès included Jews among France&#x27;s &quot;spiritual families&quot;.

After 1900, a wave of Jewish immigrants arrived, mostly fleeing the pogroms of Eastern Europe. The flow temporarily halted during World War I but resumed afterwards. The long-established, heavily assimilated Jewish population by 1920 was now only a third of the French Jewish population. It was overwhelmed by new immigrants and the restoration of Alsace-Lorraine. About 200,000 immigrants arrived, 1900 to 1939, mostly Yiddish-speakers from Russia and Poland as well as German-speaking Jews who fled the Nazi regime after 1933. The historic base of traditional Judaism was in Alsace-Lorraine, which was recovered by France in 1918.

The new arrivals got along poorly with the established elite Jewish community. They did not want to assimilate, and they vigorously supported such new causes, especially Zionism and communism. The Yiddish influx and the Jewishness of the Popular Front&#x27;s leader Léon Blum contributed to a revival of antisemitism in the 1930s. Conservative writers such as Paul Morand, Pierre Gaxotte, Marcel Jouhandeau, and the leader of &quot;Action française&quot; Charles Maurras denounced Jews. Perhaps the most violent antisemitic writer was Louis-Ferdinand Céline, who wrote, &quot;I feel myself very friendly to Hitler, and to all Germans, whom I feel to be my brothers... Our real enemies are Jews and Masons&quot;, and &quot;Yids are like bedbugs&quot;. By 1937, even mainstream French conservatives and socialists, not previously associated with antisemitism, denounced the alleged Jewish influence pushing the country into a &quot;Jewish war&quot; against Nazi Germany. The new intensity of antisemitism facilitated the extremism of the Vichy regime after 1940.

===World War II and the Holocaust===
When France came under occupation by Nazi Germany in June 1940, about 330,000 Jews lived in France (and another 370,000 in never occupied French North Africa). Of the 330,000, fewer than half held French citizenship and the others were foreigners, mostly exiles from Germany and Central Europe who had emigrated to France during the 1930s. Another 110,000 French Jews were living in the colony of French Algeria.

About 200,000 Jews, and the large majority of foreign Jews, resided in the Paris area. Among the 150,000 French Jews, about 30,000, generally native to Central Europe, had recently obtained French citizenship after emigrating to France during the 1930s. Following the 1940 armistice after Germany invaded France, the Nazis incorporated the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine into Germany. The remainder of northern and western France was placed under German military control. Unoccupied southern metropolitan France and the French empire were placed under the control of the Vichy Regime, a new collaborationist French government. Some Jews managed to escape the invading German forces. Some found refuge in the countryside. Spain allowed 25,600 Jews to use its territory as an escape route.

German occupation forces published their first anti-Jewish measure on 27 September 1940 as the &quot;First Ordinance.&quot; The measure was a census of Jews, and defined &quot;who is a Jew.&quot; The Second Ordinance was published on 18 October 1940, proscribing various business activities for Jews. On 31 August 1941 German forces confiscated all radios belonging to Jews, followed by their telephones, their bicycles, and disconnecting all phones to Jews. They were forbidden to use public telephones. Jews were forbidden to change their address, and next were forbidden to leave their homes between 8 pm and 5 am. All public places, parks, theatres and certain shops were soon closed to Jews. German forces issued new restrictions, prohibitions and decrees by the week. Jews were barred from public swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, concerts, music halls, etc. On the metro, they were allowed to ride only in the last carriage. Antisemitic articles were frequently published in newspapers since the Occupation. The Germans organized antisemitic exhibitions to spread their propaganda. The music of Jewish composers was banned, as were works of art by Jewish artists. On 2 October 1941, seven synagogues were bombed. Still, the vast majority of synagogues remained opened during the whole war in the Zone libre. The Vichy government even protected them after attacks as a way to deny persecution.
The first roundup of Jews took place on 14 May 1941, and 4,000 foreign Jews were taken captive. Another roundup took place on 20 August 1941, collecting both French and foreign Jews, who were sent to the Drancy internment camp and other concentration camps in France. Roundups continued, collecting French nationals, including lawyers and other professionals. On 12 December 1941, the most distinguished members of the Paris Jewish community, including doctors, academics, scientists and writers, were rounded up. On 29 May 1942, the Eighth Ordinance was published, which ordered Jews to wear the yellow star. The most notorious roundup was the Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv Roundup, which required detailed planning and the use of the full resources of French police forces. This roundup took place on 16 and 17 July 1942; it collected nearly 13,000 Jews, 7,000 of whom, including more than 4,000 children, were interned and locked into the Vélodrome d&#x27;Hiver, without adequate food or sanitation.

In the meantime, the Germans began deportations of Jews from France to the death camps in eastern Europe. The first trains left on 27 March 1942. Deportations continued until 17 August 1944, by which time nearly 76,000 Jews (including those from Vichy France) were deported, of whom only 2,500 survived. (see Timeline of deportations of French Jews to death camps.) The majority of Jews deported were non-French Jews. One quarter of the pre-war Jewish population of France was killed in that process.

Antisemitism was particularly virulent in Vichy France, which controlled a third of France from 1940 to 1942, at which point the Germans took over that southern area. Vichy&#x27;s Jewish policy was a mixture of 1930s antiforeigner legislation with the virulent antisemitism of the Action Française movement. The Vichy government openly collaborated with the Nazi occupiers to identify Jews for deportation and transportation to the death camps. As early as October 1940, without any request from the Germans, the Vichy government passed anti-Jewish measures (the Vichy laws on the status of Jews), prohibiting them from moving, and limiting their access to public places and most professional activities, especially the practice of medicine. The Vichy government also implemented those anti-Jewish laws in the colonies of Vichy North Africa. In 1941, the Vichy government established the &quot;Commissariat-General for Jewish Affairs,&quot; which in 1942 worked with the Gestapo to round-up Jews. They participated in the Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv roundup on 16 and 17 July 1942.

On the other hand, France is recognised as the nation with the third highest number of Righteous Among the Nations (according to the Yad Vashem museum, 2006). This award is given to &quot;non-Jews who acted according to the most noble principles of humanity by risking their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust.&quot;

In 1995 French President Jacques Chirac formally apologized to the Jewish community for the complicit role that French policemen and civil servants played in the roundups. He said:

:&quot;These black hours will stain our history for ever and are an injury to our past and our traditions. Yes, the criminal madness of the occupant was assisted (&#x27;secondée&#x27;) by the French, by the French state. Fifty-three years ago, on 16 July 1942, 450 policemen and gendarmes, French, under the authority of their leaders, obeyed the demands of the Nazis. That day, in the capital and the Paris region, nearly 10,000 Jewish men, women and children were arrested at home, in the early hours of the morning, and assembled at police stations... France, home of the Enlightenment and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, land of welcome and asylum, France committed that day the irreparable. Breaking its word, it delivered those it protected to their executioners.&quot;

Chirac also identified those who were responsible: &quot;450 policemen and gendarmes, French, under the authority of their leaders [who] obeyed the demands of the Nazis.&quot;

In July 2017, while at a ceremony at the site of the Vélodrome d&#x27;Hiver, France&#x27;s President Emmanuel Macron denounced the country&#x27;s role in the Holocaust and the historical revisionism that denied France&#x27;s responsibility for 1942 roundup and subsequent deportation of 13,000 Jews (or the eventual deportation of 76,000 Jews). He refuted claims that the Vichy government, in power during WW II, did not represent the State. &quot;It was indeed France that organised this&quot;, French police collaborating with the Nazis. &quot;Not a single German&quot; was directly involved, he added.

Neither Chirac nor François Hollande had specifically stated that the Vichy government, in power during World War II, actually represented the French State. Macron on the other hand, made it clear that the government during the War was indeed that of France. &quot;It is convenient to see the Vichy regime as born of nothingness, returned to nothingness. Yes, it&#x27;s convenient, but it is false. We cannot build pride upon a lie.&quot;

Macron made a subtle reference to Chirac&#x27;s 1995 apology when he added, &quot;I say it again here. It was indeed France that organized the roundup, the deportation, and thus, for almost all, death.&quot;

===Post-World War II: Anti-discriminatory laws and migration===

In the wake of the Holocaust, around 180,000 Jews remained in France, many of whom were refugees from Eastern Europe who either could not or would not return to their former home countries. To prevent the types of abuses that took place under the German Occupation and Vichy Regime, the legislature passed laws to suppress antisemitic harassment and actions, and established educational programs.

====Jewish exodus from France&#x27;s colonies in North Africa====
The surviving French Jews were joined in the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s by large numbers of Jews from France&#x27;s predominantly Muslim North African colonies (along with millions of other French nationals) as part of the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries. They fled to France because of the decline of the French Empire and a surge in Muslim Antisemitism following the founding of Israel and Israel&#x27;s victories in the Six-Day War and other Arab-Israeli wars.

By 1951, France&#x27;s Jewish population totalled around 250,000. Between 1956 and 1967, about 235,000 Sephardi Jews from Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt emigrated to France.

By 1968, Sephardi Jews from the former French possessions in North Africa constituted the majority of the Jews of France. Before World War II and the Holocaust, French Jews were predominately from the Ashkenazi tradition and culture. The Sephardim, who follow nusach sepharad (Judaism as per the Sephardic ritual, according to Dan Michman&#x27;s definition of such Jews), have since had a significant influence on the nature of French Jewish culture. These Jews from French North Africa have generally enjoyed a successful social and economic integration and helped reinvigorate the country&#x27;s Jewish community. Kosher restaurants and Jewish schools have multiplied, in particular since the 1980s. In part in response to internal and international events, many of the younger generations have committed to religious renewal.

In the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing, France&#x27;s Jewish population suffered its first deadly terrorist attack since actions of the German occupation in the Second World War. The attack followed an increase in antisemitic incidents in the late 1970s by Neo Nazis.

====France–Israel relations====

Since World War II, France&#x27;s government has varied in supporting and opposing the Israeli government. It was initially a very strong supporter of Israel, voting for its formation at the United Nations. It was Israel&#x27;s main ally and primary supplier of military hardware for nearly two decades between 1948 and 1967.

After the military alliance between France and Israel during the 1956 Suez Crisis, relations between Israel and France remained strong. It is widely believed that, as a result of the Protocol of Sèvres agreement, the French government secretly transported parts of its own atomic technology to Israel in the late 1950s which the Israeli government used to create nuclear weapons.

But, after the end of the Algerian War in 1962, in which Algeria gained independence, France began to shift toward a more pro-Arab view. This change accelerated rapidly after the Six-Day War in 1967, in which the relations became strained. Following the war, the United States became Israel&#x27;s main supplier of weapons and military technology. After the 1972 Munich massacre at the Olympics, the French government refused to extradite Abu Daoud, one of the planners of the attack. Both France and Israel participated in the 15-year-long Lebanese Civil War.

==21st century==

France has the largest Jewish population in Europe and the third largest Jewish population in the world (after Israel and the United States). The Jewish community in France is estimated from a core population of 480,000–500,000 to an enlarged population of 600,000.

In 2009, France&#x27;s highest court, the council of state issued a ruling recognising the state&#x27;s responsibility in the deportation of tens of thousands of Jews during World War II. The report cited &quot;mistakes&quot; in the Vichy regime that had not been forced by the occupiers, stating that the state &quot;allowed or facilitated the deportation from France of victims of anti-Semitism&quot;.

===Antisemitism and Jewish emigration===

In the early 2000s, rising levels of antisemitism among French Muslims and antisemitic acts were publicized around the world, including the desecration of Jewish graves and tensions between the children of North African Muslim immigrants and North African Jewish children. One of the worst crimes happened when Ilan Halimi was mutilated and tortured to death by the so-called &quot;Barbarians gang&quot;, led by Youssouf Fofana. This murder was motivated by money and fueled by antisemitic prejudices (the perpetrators said they believed Jews to be rich). In March 2012, a gunman, who had previously killed three soldiers, opened fire at a Jewish school in Toulouse in an antisemitic attack, killing four people, including three children. President Nicolas Sarkozy said, &quot;I want to say to all the leaders of the Jewish community, how close we feel to them. All of France is by their side.&quot;

However, Jewish philanthropist Baron Eric de Rothschild suggested that the extent of antisemitism in France has been exaggerated and that &quot;France was not an antisemitic country&quot;. The Newspaper &quot;Le Monde Diplomatique&quot; had earlier said the same thing. According to a 2005 poll made by the Pew Research Center, there is no evidence of any specific antisemitism in France, which, according to this poll, appears to be one of the least antisemitic countries in Europe, though France has the world&#x27;s third largest Jewish population. France is the country that had the most favourable views of Jews in Europe (82%), next to the Netherlands, and the country with the third-fewest unfavourable views (16%) next to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

Rises in antisemitism in modern France have been linked to the intensifying Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Between the start of the Israeli offensive in Gaza in late December 2008 and its end in January 2009, an estimated hundred antisemitic acts were recorded in France. This compares with a total of 250 antisemitic acts in the whole of 2007. In 2009, 832 acts of antisemitism were recorded in France (with, in the first half of 2009, an estimated 631 acts, more than the whole of 2008, 474), in 2010, 466 and, in 2011, 389. In 2011, there were 260 threats (100 graffitis, 46 flyers or mails, 114 insults) and 129 crimes (57 assaults, 7 arsons or attempted arsons, 65 deteriorations and acts of vandalism but no murder, attempted murder or terrorist attack) recorded.

Between 2000 and 2009, 13,315 French Jews moved to Israel, or made aliyah, an increase compared to the previous decade (1990–1999 : 10,443) that was in the continuity of a similar increase since the 1970s. A peak was reached during this period, in 2005 (2005: 2,951 Olim) but a significant proportion (between 20 and 30%) eventually came back to France. Some immigrants cited antisemitism and the growing Arab population as reasons for leaving. One couple who moved to Israel claimed that rising antisemitism by French Muslims and the anti-Israel bias of the French government was making life for Jews increasingly uncomfortable for them. At a welcoming ceremony for French Jews in the summer of 2004, then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon caused controversy when he advised all French Jews to &quot;move immediately&quot; to Israel and escape what he coined &quot;the wildest anti-semitism&quot; in France. In August 2007, some 2,800 olim were due to arrive in Israel from France, as opposed to the 3,000 initially forecast. 1,129 French Jews made aliyah to Israel in 2009 and 1,286 in 2010.

However, in the long term, France is not one of the top countries of Jewish emigration toward Israel. Many French Jews feel a strong attachment to France. In November 2012, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a joint press conference with François Hollande advised the French Jewish community by saying &quot;In my role as Prime Minister of Israel, I always say to Jews, wherever they may be, I say to them: Come to Israel and make Israel your home.&quot; alluding to former Israel Prime Minister&#x27;s Ariel Sharon&#x27;s similar 2004 advisement towards the French Jewish community to move to Israel.
In 2013, 3,120 French Jews emigrated to Israel, marking a 63% increase over the previous year.

During the first few months of 2014, The Jewish Agency of Israel continued to encourage French aliyah through aliyah fairs, Hebrew-language courses, sessions that assist potential olim to find jobs in Israel, and immigrant absorption in Israel. A May 2014 survey revealed that 74 percent of French Jews considered leaving France for Israel where of the 74 percent, 29.9 percent cited anti-Semitism. Another 24.4 cited their desire to &quot;preserve their Judaism,&quot; while 12.4 percent said they were attracted by other countries. &quot;Economic considerations&quot; was cited by 7.5 percent of the respondents. By June 2014, it was estimated by the end of 2014 a full 1 percent of the French Jewish community would have made aliyah to Israel, the largest in a single year. Many Jewish leaders stated that emigration is being driven by a combination of factors, including the cultural gravitation towards Israel and France&#x27;s economic woes, especially for the younger generation drawn by the possibility of other socioeconomic opportunities in the more vibrant Israeli economy. Others point out that in 2014, many dramatic incidents of antisemitism took place, especially during Operation Protective Edge, and that France took an unusual pro-Palestine stance by recognizing the State of Palestine in Parliament and by undertaking to adopt a resolution in the United Nations Security Council which would unilaterally impose an end of the Israel-Arab conflict on Israel. At the end of 2014, a record 7,000 French Jews are reported to have made Aliyah. Some wealthy French Jewish families are choosing to emigrate to the United States instead, with &quot;less red tape&quot; for business than Israel.

In January 2015, events such as the Charlie Hebdo shooting and Porte de Vincennes hostage crisis created a shock wave of fear across the French Jewish community. As a result of these events, the Jewish Agency planned an aliyah plan for 120,000 French Jews who wish to make aliyah. In addition, with Europe&#x27;s stagnant economy as of early 2015, many affluent French Jewish skilled professionals, business moguls and investors have sought Israel as a start-up haven for international investments, as well as job and new business opportunities. Dov Maimon, a French Jewish émigré who studies migration as a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute, predicted as many as 250,000 French Jews to make aliyah by the year 2030.

Hours after the 2015 Saint-Quentin-Fallavier attack on a gas factory near Lyon on 26 June 2015, in which the severed head of a local (non-Jewish) businessman was pinned to the gates and an ISIS flag was raised, Immigration and Absorption Minister Ze&#x27;ev Elkin strongly urged the French Jewish community to move to Israel and made it a national priority for Israel to welcome the French Jewish community with open arms. Immigration from France is on the rise: in the first half of 2015, approximately 5,100 French Jews made aliyah to Israel marking 25% more than in the same period during the previous year.

Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, committed by suspected ISIS affiliates reputedly in retaliation for Opération Chammal, more than 80 percent of French Jews considered making aliyah. The largest attack on the evening of 13 November killed 90 people, leaving 200 wounded at a rock concert in the Bataclan Theatre in Paris. Although its long time Jewish owners (who regularly set Jewish events there, including some in support of Israel) had sold the theatre shortly before the massacre, speculation arose about an antisemitic motive behind the attack, but this was not a popular theory in the French media. However, to some, this possible antisemitic motive was concealed by the general media, raising questions about the media&#x27;s motives to do this, an issue reflected in the French Jewish community press.

According to the Jewish Agency, nearly 6500 French Jews had made aliyah as of mid-November 2015 and it was estimated that 8000 French Jews would settle down in Israel by the end of 2015.

In January 2016, a 35-year-old teacher in Marseille was attacked with a machete by a Kurdish teenager. Some Jewish groups debated recommending that Jews not wear the kippah in public. A 73 year old Jewish municipal councillor in Créteil was murdered in his apartment the same month.

On 4 April 2017, the horrific murder of a 65-year-old French Jewish woman, Sarah Halimi, in her popular neighborhood home of Belleville in Paris, around the corner from a mosque reputed for its radicalism, and as police standing in the staircase heard the murderer yelling &quot;Allahu akbar&quot; repeatedly for minutes, and did not intervene in spite of the screams and the beating, has raised questions again. As it took several months for the French justice to qualify this murder as an antisemitic act, concern about an institutional covering of antisemitism increased. It was further feared as Roger Pinto was mugged with his family during a burglary at his Livry-Gargan home on 8 September 2017. Pinto soon witnessed that, as for Ilan Halimi&#x27;s murder, he was told, &quot;You are Jewish so you must have money;&quot; this attack has neither been qualified as an anti-semitic act.

On 23 March 2018, an 85-year-old French Jewish woman and Holocaust survivor, Mireille Knoll, was found dead in her apartment in the east of the French capital, where she lived alone.

According to the World Zionist Organization, in the first seven months of 2024 an estimated 1600 French Jews emigrated to Israel (a 50% increase over the same period the previous year). The organization also noted a 335% increase in the amount of French Jews opening &quot;aliyah&quot; files in France.
