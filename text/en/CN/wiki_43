<text>Pokémon Live! is a musical stage production that toured the United States from September 15, 2000, to January 28, 2001. The musical was based on the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series, using similar characters, clothing, and story elements. The show uses songs previously released on the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime soundtracks &quot;Pokémon 2BA Master&quot; and &quot;Totally Pokémon&quot; as well as original songs.

Approximately 90 minutes in length, the plot follows Ash Ketchum, Misty and Brock as they travel to a contest to win the much sought-after Diamond Badge. The event turns out to be part of a plan by the evil organization Team Rocket and its diabolical leader Giovanni to take over the world.

The show was successful, but received mixed reviews from critics. Despite the official &quot;Pokémon&quot; website mentioning plans for it, a home video release never came to fruition. A planned television release was also scrapped. A cast recording CD of the show, however, had a limited release.

Plans for 2002 performances in the United Kingdom were also made, but later cancelled. &quot;Pokémon Live!&quot; was invited to perform in Dubai, U.A.E. at Al Mamzar Park in March 2001, coinciding with the annual Dubai Shopping Festival. A Portuguese version of the show, produced by television company SIC, was performed from March 21 to March 27, 2002, at the Pavilhão Atlântico in Lisbon, Portugal. A Dutch adaptation of the musical was performed on April 6 and 7, 2002, at the Sportpaleis in Belgium.

Footage of the production did not surface until Chris Mitchell, the Production Stage Manager for the US tour, posted videos of the complete performance in Milwaukee&#x27;s US Cellular Arena (dated December 30, 2000) in seven parts to his personal YouTube channel in 2012 and the whole performance in one video in 2016. In September 2020, a YouTube user named Benjamin Delbert posted an edit using restored elements from almost every performance of the show&#x27;s run on YouTube.

==Plot synopsis==

The following synopsis is based on videos of the show as provided by the production manager, Chris Mitchell, and the script he provided to pocketmonsters.net.

===Act I===
The story begins with a shadowed Giovanni releasing a commercial challenging all Pokémon Trainers to win the one-of-a-kind Diamond Badge by defeating him and his Pokémon in a battle. Ash declines to join his mother Delia, and Professor Oak to a lecture on sleep disorders among Snorlax, because he has decided to accept the mysterious Gym Leader&#x27;s challenge. As he prepares for the journey, Misty chastises him for not taking her to the movies for her birthday as promised three weeks ago. Ash promises to make it up to her somehow, but adds that Pokémon are his friends too (&quot;You and Me and Pokémon&quot;). Together with Brock, Ash and Misty head off for the Gym using a map downloaded from the Diamond Badge website.

Meanwhile, Jessie, James, and Meowth get a call from Giovanni ordering them to go to his headquarters. When they arrive, he gloats about his ultimate creation, MechaMew2. The mechanical monster—based on the powerful Mewtwo he had late in the anime&#x27;s first season and &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot;—will soon be unstoppable (&quot;It Will All Be Mine&quot;). He orders Team Rocket to capture Ash&#x27;s Pikachu, because it has &quot;Thundershock&quot; and &quot;Thunder Attack&quot;, two techniques that MechaMew2 doesn&#x27;t have. They promise to do as he says after he promises them a good pay. Soon, several trainers face off against MechaMew2, which copies the attack of its challengers and uses it against them to defeat them. Among the moves it learns is &quot;Self Destruct&quot;, which it is &quot;not&quot; ordered to return as doing so would destroy it. Giovanni praises his mechanical Pokémon and gloats that as soon as it learns every Pokémon&#x27;s attack, nothing will stand in his way (&quot;It Will All Be Mine (Reprise)&quot;).

In the forest, Brock chases cute girls and Misty laments that Ash is ignoring her in favor of his Pokémon. Ash tells his friends that he wants them to travel together forever (&quot;My Best Friends&quot;). Jessie, James and Meowth dig a pitfall trap for Ash and his friends to fall into, but the heroes walk right over it without incident because the Rockets forgot to remove the supports. To their misfortune, Jessie and James only realize the cause when they pull out the supports and fall into their own trap, leaving a frustrated Meowth to run off for a rope to pull them out.

In the meantime, Delia and Professor Oak approach the old, run-down building where the Snorlax lecture is supposed to be held. After Delia confesses that she feels that she is losing touch with her son, the Professor reassures her by saying that things never stay the same for long (&quot;Everything Changes&quot;). Suddenly, several Rocket Grunts rush out of the shadows and surround them, and Giovanni says that the lecture was a trap to lure Professor Oak to them. When the Boss also recognizes Delia, she insists that anything between them was in the past, to which he says that some things don&#x27;t &quot;have&quot; to change. Giovanni orders the Rocket Grunts to take Delia and Oak to an (offstage) helicopter and to his headquarters, where they&#x27;ll witness something that will change the world forever (&quot;Everything Changes (Reprise 1)&quot;).

Back in the forest, the heroes are lost and alone after Brock earlier threw the map in the river while asking a female trainer for directions. They try getting help from a deaf trainer with Brock interpreting his signs, who agrees to share his map on the condition that he and the &quot;guy with the goofy smile&quot; have a battle first. Offended, Ash agrees to this, but the deaf trainer sends out Jigglypuff, who instantly starts singing, which makes everyone fall asleep, after which Jigglypuff draws on their faces. Some time later, Misty wakes up and wipes Jigglypuff&#x27;s drawings off Ash&#x27;s face, singing about her unrequited love for him as she does so (&quot;Misty&#x27;s Song&quot;). Ash and Brock wake up as well, with the former wondering aloud who was singing just now. Misty claims the song was Jigglypuff&#x27;s, and the heroes notice that the deaf trainer kept his end of the deal and left his map for them. The group continues on to the next part of the path, this time with Misty carrying the map.

Meanwhile, Meowth gets Jessie and James, who have also danced to Jigglypuff&#x27;s song, out of the pit while complaining about their incompetence. Realizing that Meowth is right, Jessie and James lament their status as failures. Meowth cheers them up by telling them that being failures is something at which they&#x27;re successful (&quot;The Best at Being the Worst&quot;). With that, the Rockets set out to find Pikachu again. Using their Magikarp submarine, they manage to catch up with the trainers at Cerulean Blue Lagoon, where Ash declares that he&#x27;s going to use Pikachu against the gym leader (&quot;Pikachu (I Choose You)&quot;). While the kids get caught up in the song, Team Rocket captures Pikachu when he dances near them. By the time Ash realizes Pikachu is missing, Team Rocket is long gone.

===Act II===

After an intermission segment in which Ash&#x27;s Pokédex Dexter explains his important contribution to Ash&#x27;s continuing success and gathers data from the audience (&quot;What Kind of Pokémon Are You?&quot;), the heroes return to the forest. Ash is positive that his favorite Pokémon has once again been kidnapped by Team Rocket. Misty, still upset about being ignored on her birthday, suggests that maybe Pikachu has just left Ash of his own will because of the trainer&#x27;s new habit of ignoring his friends. She runs after Brock, leaving Ash to ponder her words and worry that Pikachu did leave on his own. Ash bids an emotional farewell to Pikachu (&quot;The Time Has Come&quot;).

At the Gym, Delia and Professor Oak are in the battle arena and locked inside giant cages. Oak asks Delia why the Boss recognized her. She explains that Giovanni is an old boyfriend from when she was a teenager and used to hang out with a bad crowd, which she put behind her when she met Ash&#x27;s father. She never told this to Ash, fearing that he would not understand. Delia came to hate Giovanni, which he arrives just in time to hear. Realizing Delia has changed, Giovanni tells them that they&#x27;re here to witness the final battle, as the only attacks left to be learned are Pikachu&#x27;s electric moves (&quot;You and Me and Pokémon (Reprise)&quot;). Immediately after, the Rockets arrive with the captured Pikachu (&quot;Double Trouble&quot;). Giovanni orders them to battle MechaMew2 using Pikachu. They attempt to command Pikachu, but Pikachu shocks the Rockets instead, knocking them into the cages and allowing Oak and Delia to escape. Giovanni is unconcerned with his prisoners&#x27; escape. He realizes that Pikachu&#x27;s trainer is necessary to make it battle, so he orders Jessie, James, and Meowth to bring Ash to him. They agree and set off to capture Ash (&quot;Double Trouble (Reprise)&quot;).

Meanwhile, as she and Brock search fruitlessly for Pikachu, Misty admits that she just wanted Ash to realize that he&#x27;s alienating his friends—specifically, her. Brock realizes Misty really likes Ash, and Misty denies it by saying Brock wouldn&#x27;t know anything about liking someone—after all, he&#x27;s always chasing Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny (&quot;Two Perfect Girls&quot;).

Not far away, Delia and Professor Oak continue their discussion about her past and conflict over whether or not to tell it to Ash. Meanwhile, Misty continues to lament over her feelings for Ash. Elsewhere, Ash tells himself that he may have to go on without Pikachu, even if it hurts (&quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;). Soon, all five of them converge in the forest. Delia tells Ash that Giovanni has Pikachu in his hideout and that Team Rocket kidnapped him. Ash is furious, determined to get his Pokémon back and win the Diamond Badge. Before he can leave, Delia tells Ash of her past with Giovanni. Ash is shocked by the news and is in a hurry to leave. Suddenly, Jessie and James appear on scooters, ordering Ash to come with them. The team is utterly shocked when Ash agrees to join them without a fight. The others try to follow, but Meowth says that Ash was the only Pokémon trainer Giovanni wanted. As Ash and Team Rocket leave, Delia laments that she gave Ash even more of a reason to confront Giovanni. (&quot;Everything Changes (Reprise 2)&quot;).

At his headquarters, Giovanni tells MechaMew2 that soon, their conquest of the world will begin. Ash runs in and demands that his Pikachu be returned. When Giovanni hears his surname and realizes he&#x27;s Delia&#x27;s son, Ash is angered and tells him to leave his mother out of this. Jessie and James enter announcing their capture of Ash, missing that he had already entered the arena, and celebrate having done two things correctly in one day. The Boss grows annoyed with them and orders them to leave, and they crash their scooters upon exiting. Joyfully reunited with Pikachu, Ash prepares to battle Giovanni and is shocked when he reveals himself to be the Gym Leader from the commercial. Giovanni mockingly gives Ash the Diamond Badge, saying he&#x27;ll retrieve it after Ash loses.

Ash orders Pikachu to Thundershock, then Thunder MechaMew2, but the attacks do not affect it. MechaMew2 then returns the attacks, rendering Pikachu unable to battle. With that, Giovanni proclaims his victory because his Pokémon has now learned every single attack. Undaunted, Ash engages the Boss in a fistfight (&quot;You Just Can&#x27;t Win&quot;). Tiring of the scuffle, Giovanni orders MechaMew2 to attack Ash with Hyper Beam, but Mewtwo appears to save Ash with a forcefield. He then attacks MechaMew2 with a collection of Ash&#x27;s happy memories, like his love for Pokémon and Misty. MechaMew2 speaks for the first time and rebels against Giovanni, revealing that it learned about love and goodness from Ash. Recognizing that Giovanni is evil, MechaMew2 feels it must stop his plans no matter the cost. MechaMew2 puts Giovanni in a headlock and prepares to Selfdestruct, telling Mewtwo to take an unconscious Ash somewhere safe. Mewtwo exits with Ash and Pikachu, but not before explaining to Giovanni that Ash was the one who defeated MechaMew2. Giovanni breaks free of MechaMew2&#x27;s grip and runs just before it blows up.

In the forest, Ash&#x27;s friends ask him what happened, but Ash can&#x27;t remember Mewtwo&#x27;s sudden appearance or how the battle ended. He does, however, understand that his mom is still his mom, and he loves her regardless of her past. Reaching into his pocket, Ash pulls out the Diamond Badge, saying that he must have won it after all. He gives the badge to Misty as her birthday present while everybody else celebrates his triumph (&quot;Finale&quot;). Just before curtain call, the entire human and Pokémon cast appear and dance, including Giovanni.

==Critical reception==
The play received negative reception from critics. Little Review said &quot;Maybe it&#x27;s different in Japan, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine a Japanese version of &quot;Pokémon Live!&quot;. This show may be based on televised anime, but its antecedents lie in American musicals from &quot;The King and I&quot; to &quot;Annie&quot; to &quot;The Lion King&quot;, with the Solid Gold Dancers and the Backstreet Boys mixed in. If you have a rudimentary knowledge of &quot;Pokémon&quot; and an enthusiastic underage companion, you&#x27;ll find that you&#x27;re having a good time even as your eyes roll towards the projection of Haunter on the ceiling.&quot;

<text>Topolobampo () is a port on the Gulf of California in northwestern Sinaloa, Mexico. It is the fourth-largest town in the municipality of Ahome (after Los Mochis, Ahome, and Higuera de Zaragoza), reporting a 2010 census population of 6,361 inhabitants.

The port connects the northern Mexican states through the Chihuahua-Pacific Railroad, which has a terminus in nearby Los Mochis. It is the eastern port for the daily car ferry connecting to La Paz in Baja California Sur.

Topolobampo is also the beginning of the international trade corridor, &quot;La Entrada al Pacifico&quot;, that ends near the Midland-Odessa, Texas area.

==History==

Topolobampo was the site of a Radical &quot;utopian&quot; colony inspired by Henry George&#x27;s economic ideas. 

That utopian group published a newsletter in English, &quot;The Credit Foncier of Sinaloa&quot; in Topolobampo. The masthead says &quot;Collective ownership and management for public utilities and conveniences - the community responsible for the health, usefulness, individuality and security of each. - Albert K. Owen.&quot; Two pages of one edition (vol. 4, no. 24, September 1, 1889, whole no. 161), has been preserved at Western Reserve Historical Society in Cleveland, Ohio, pasted into a Wallace Cathcart scrapbook on Shakers. Those two pages include an article on the Tyringham, Massachusetts Shakers and correspondence from several prospective members. Evidently the fledgling group hoped to use the reminiscences of Julia Johnson, a former Shaker, to market the concept of a communal society to prospective members.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===

Topolobampo has a tropical arid desert climate.


The sea experiences lows of 19 - 20 °C during the winter months, and highs of 29 - 31 °C during the summer months.

<text>Joe Bob Goes to the Drive In is the first book by John Bloom under the pen name Joe Bob Briggs. It consists of his movie reviews written between 1982 and 1985.

Joe Bob was Bloom&#x27;s satirical creation, allowing him to spoof stereotypical &quot;redneck&quot; Texan values while giving genuine praise to schlock films. It was not widely known until he was fired in 1985 that Briggs was not, in fact, a real person.

Joe Bob exclusively viewed movies in drive-ins, in his Oldsmobile Toronado with any one of several girlfriends. According to his column, he has four ex-wives, and is always on the lookout for &quot;ex-wife number five&quot;. An entire fictional cast of characters popped up over the period of the column, who would often be mentioned in the story along with the movie reviews.

The entire book is made up of columns and shorter segments called &quot;Joe Bob&#x27;s Mailbag,&quot; when Joe Bob writes back to his fans, and often his critics. The only two people who actually appear in the first person are Joe Bob and Stephen King, who saw several of his books made into movies during that period and actually wrote the introduction to the book when it was compiled and published in 1987.

Joe Bob/Bloom lived in Texas during the duration of both this book and its sequel, &quot;Joe Bob Goes Back to the Drive In&quot;. At first his column appeared solely in The Dallas Times-Herald, but was eventually syndicated before Joe Bob was dropped completely. This event actually signals the end of the book, when Joe Bob states that he had been &#x27;killed&#x27;.

<doc id="1243838" wikidata="Q967015" url="?curid=1243838" title="Mikołaj Radziwiłł the Black">
<text>Mikołaj Krzysztof Radziwiłł (4 February 1515 – 28 May 1565), nicknamed the Black (, ), was a Polish- Lithuanian noble who held several administrative positions within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, including the Voivode of Vilnius, Grand Lithuanian Chancellor, and the Grand Hetman of Lithuania. He was also Reichsfürst (Prince) of the Holy Roman Empire.

Alternate renditions of his name include , , and . His first name is sometimes given in English as Nicholas.

==Political influence==
Mikołaj was able to gain much political influence thanks to the romance and then the marriage between his cousin Barbara Radziwiłł and the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund II Augustus. This made him one of the most powerful royal advisers. Mikołaj became Marshal of Lithuania, Grand Chancellor of Lithuania, as well as Palatine of Vilnius, gained immense wealth and became the most powerful magnate in the Commonwealth of that time. The growing influence of the Radziwiłł family was further bolstered when, during a diplomatic mission to Charles V and Ferdinand I, he and his cousin Mikołaj the Red received a hereditary title of &quot;Prince&quot; (Reichsfürst (SRI)).

He formed an alliance with his cousin Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot; Radziwiłł against other notable Lithuanian families in the rivalry for the dominant status in the Great Duchy of Lithuania. This alliance marked the formation of a dynastic-like cooperation between Radziwiłłs and showed how family interests could affect magnates&#x27; relations with the state. Both Radziwiłłs backed the cause of Lithuania&#x27;s sovereignty and opposed the growing Polish-Lithuanian union.

Despite opposing close ties with Poland, he was the chief negotiator in the successful negotiation between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the state controlled by the Livonian Order, which led to the secularisation of Livonia and its union with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1562.

Mikołaj contributed to the ongoing Polonisation of the Grand Duchy, influencing other Lithuanian nobles to follow him in adopting Polish cultureits fashion, customs and language. Despite being a fervent opponent of the closer union with Poland, he was an active supporter of Polish culture in Lithuania. He himself did not speak Lithuanian, his knowledge of Ruthenian was limited. Polish was his native language and the only one he was able to use fluently.

==Religious activities==

He was known for his religious beliefs, as he was one of the most prominent converts and advocates of the Reformed churches faith in Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He provided financial support for the printing of the first complete Polish translation of the Bible in 1563 in Brest-Litovsk, distributed works written in defense of the Reformed faith, financed a church and college in Vilnius, supported educated Protestants, and in various other ways fostered the Calvinist faith. He is known to have exchanged letters with John Calvin and protected religious exiles from Italy. Because Protestants supported usage of local languages, he is also believed to have funded Lithuanian churches and schools.

==Legacy==
With the exception of his daughter Anna, all his children converted to Roman Catholicism and became ardent supporters of the Counter Reformation.

He is remembered by a statue in the Brest Millennium Monument.

<doc id="1243846" wikidata="Q962956" url="?curid=1243846" title="Bocchus II">
<text>Bocchus II was a king of Mauretania in the 1st century BC. He was the son of Mastanesosus, who died in 49 BC, upon which Bocchus inherited the throne.

== Biography ==
He was the son of Mastanesosus, king of Mauretania. His father was identified from the Latin legends of the coins that give the exact lineage &quot;Rex Bocchus Sosi f&quot; or &quot;Sos fi&quot; and cannot be read other than &quot;King Bocchus son of Sosus&quot;. By 49 BC, Mauretania seems to have been partitioned between Bocchus II and Bogud II, who are speculated to have been perhaps cousins or brothers, though the lineage is unknown. Bocchus II ruled over the eastern part of Mauretania and had Iol as capital, while Bogud II ruled over the western part of Mauretania and had Volubilis as capital. The only known things about his rule were three events: his relations with Sittius, his part in the war against Juba I and the Pompeians, and the annexation of Western Mauretania. He was recognized as king by the Caesarean Senate in 49 BC, but he was previously hostile to Juba and it is unknown when exactly his reign began. It is certain that by this time, him and his brother Bogud, would plead in favor of Caesar against the Pompeians and their ally Juba I, king of Numidia.

=== Conquest of Numidia ===
During the Roman civil war of 49–45, Bocchus and Sittius invaded Numidia, overthrowing Massinissa II, whose kingdom was easily conquered, and seized Cirta within a few days, the capital of the kingdom of Juba I, who was thus obliged to abandon the idea of joining Metellus Scipio against Caesar. Bocchus&#x27;s actions stopped there, but Sittius continued the fight, beating Saburra, the lieutenant of Juba, capturing Faustus Sulla, and Afranius, leading his fleet to Hippo Regius, where he caught Metellus Scipio&#x27;s ship rushing. At the end of the war, Caesar bestowed upon Bocchus part of the territory of Masinissa II, Juba&#x27;s ally, which was recovered by Massinissa&#x27;s son Arabio after Caesar&#x27;s murder. The kingdom of Mauretania thus extended to Ampsaga. The rest of the kingdom of Massinissa II, the region near the sea north of Cirta and the territory of Cirta, which had belonged to Juba, were given to Sittius.

=== Annexation of Western Mauretania and death ===
Dio Cassius says that Bocchus sent his sons to support Sextus Pompeius in Spain, while Bogud fought on the side of Caesar, and there is no doubt that after Caesar&#x27;s death Bocchus supported Octavian, and Bogud Antony.

During Bogud&#x27;s absence in Spain, Bocchus II seized the whole of Mauretania, and was confirmed sole ruler by Octavian. Thus Bocchus II reconstituted a unification of a larger Mauretanian kingdom than Bocchus I and Sosus had ever known. He died without heir in 33 BC, donating his kingdom to Augustus, who, after a brief period of direct administration (33 BC - 25 BC), gave it in 25 BC to Juba II, the son of Juba I and king of Numidia. Subsequently, Numidia (except of Western Numidia) was directly annexed to the Roman Empire as the part of the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis, whereas the kingdom of Mauretania (enlarged by Western Numidia) continued as a Roman client state under kings Juba II (25 BC – AD 23) and his son and successor Ptolemy of Mauretania (20 – 40) until it was annexed to the Roman Empire during the reign of Claudius.

<text>Olsen Field at Blue Bell Park is a baseball stadium in College Station, Texas, that is home to the Texas A&amp;M baseball program. The stadium was dedicated on March 21, 1978, and is named in honor of C. E. &quot;Pat&quot; Olsen, a 1923 graduate of Texas A&amp;M University and a former baseball player in the New York Yankees minor league system. Olsen Field has served as an NCAA regional site five times and had its 1999 regional attendance ranked second with 53,287. The first NCAA Regional Tournament held at Olsen Field was in 1989. In 2004 &quot;Sports Illustrated on Campus&quot; ranked Olsen Field &quot;the best college baseball venue.&quot; 

Olsen Field underwent a major renovation that began on June 7, 2011, funded in part by donations from the owners of Blue Bell Creameries, based in nearby Brenham. In return, Blue Bell gained naming rights. Some new features of the stadium included an expanded concourse and concessions area, luxury suites, a new press box, club seating, two grass berms, expanded locker rooms and coaches offices, a student athletic center, and extended seating closer to the field. However, the seating capacity was decreased from 7,000 to 5,400 to accommodate the changes (although with standing room only will still hold over 7,000). Olsen Field reopened on February 17, 2012, for the first game of the 2012 baseball season even though some projects were not completely finished; the remaining work was completed on non-game days.

In 2015, the Aggies ranked 7th among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 4,857 per home game. On April 13, 2024, a new post-renovation attendance record was set, with 8,075 watching the Texas A&amp;M Aggies defeat the Vanderbilt Commodores by a score of 9-0.

<text>Edward Raymond Stanky (&quot;né&quot; Stankiewicz) (September 3, 1915 – June 6, 1999) was an American professional baseball second baseman, shortstop, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs, Brooklyn Dodgers, Boston Braves, New York Giants, and St. Louis Cardinals between 1943 and 1953. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

It took Stanky eight years to reach the major leagues at age 27, after starting out at Greenville, Mississippi, in the East Dixie League, where he was a teammate of future St. Louis Cardinals star Harry Brecheen, whom Stanky would manage in St. Louis in 1952. After spending a brief time as a player-manager, he transitioned to managing full-time, ending his MLB career in 1968, along with a brief return in 1977. In the interim, he had a successful run as an NCAA baseball manager.

==&quot;He just knows how to win&quot;==
Stanky was famous for his ability to draw walks; he drew 100 or more walks in each of six different seasons, 140 or more in two of them. In 1946, he hit just .273 but his 137 walks allowed him to lead the league in OBP with .436, edging out Stan Musial—who led in more than ten hitting categories. His best season was probably 1950 with the Giants, when he hit an even .300 and led the league in walks (144) and OBP (.460). On August 30, he tied a major league record when he walked in seven consecutive plate appearances (in two games).
Leo Durocher, who managed him with the Dodgers and Giants, once summed up Stanky&#x27;s talents: he said the second baseman &quot;can&#x27;t hit, can&#x27;t run, can&#x27;t field [but] he just knows how to win.&quot; Yankee shortstop Phil Rizzuto still complained years later about a notorious play during Game 3 of the 1951 World Series in which Stanky kicked the ball loose from Rizzuto&#x27;s glove as he slid into second base, instrumental in the Giant win that put them ahead two games to one, although they lost the next three and the Series with it. Stanky himself said, &quot;I would spike my mother if it meant being safe on a close play.&quot;

As a runner at third base with less than two out, he would station himself several feet back of the bag, in shallow left field. He would time the arc of any outfield fly and then take off running, step on third as the catch was being made and continue to run at full speed, making it almost impossible to throw him out at home, a tactic eventually outlawed as a result. He was also (in)famous for what came to be called &quot;the Stanky maneuver&quot;, distracting opposing hitters by jumping up and down and waving his arms behind the pitcher from his second base position.

Stanky was also a master of the &quot;delayed steal&quot; in which the runner feigns disinterest after the pitch, but instead of walking back to first breaks for second as soon as the infielders return to their normal positions. As Cardinal player-manager, he would hold up games close to being called on account of darkness or curfew when that would benefit his team, by walking leisurely to the mound from second base or the dugout (when not playing) after every pitch to confer with his pitcher, eventually resulting in the one-trip-per-inning rule.

==Contribution to breaking the color barrier==
Stanky contributed to the breaking of the color barrier as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Upon first meeting Jackie Robinson at spring training, Stanky told him he was not in favor of integrating baseball, and that he was unhappy that it was his own team doing it, but that despite his own personal feelings, Robinson was now his teammate, and Stanky promised he would have his back. When Robinson began playing that season, he was treated harshly and discriminated against, and frequently taunted with insults and threats by players from the opposing teams. Stanky stayed silent at first, but finally yelled back at Ben Chapman&#x27;s racist insults during a game. Not long afterward, the other Dodgers began to stand up for Robinson as well. The incident is portrayed in the film &quot;42&quot;. Stanky is played by Jesse Luken.

Robinson, a natural second baseman, was shifted to first base in his rookie season as Stanky was already the Dodgers&#x27; second baseman and leadoff hitter. Robinson credited Stanky with giving him tips that made the transition to first base easier. Before the 1948 season began, Stanky was traded to the Boston Braves so that Robinson could return to his natural position and also bat leadoff. Stanky also demanded a trade because he thought Durocher had taken Branch Rickey&#x27;s side in a salary dispute, which Stanky considered &quot;a knife in my back.&quot;

==Manager of Cardinals and White Sox==
He appeared in three World Series in the five years between 1947 and 1951—with three different National League champions, the Dodgers, Braves and Giants, all of whom lost to their American League opponents. In 1948, he was on pace to have his finest season. Batting .320 in July, his season was interrupted on July 8 when he broke his right leg in a collision with Bruce Edwards while trying to return to third base during a game. Originally expected to be out for just two weeks, Stanky did not play again for the Braves until September 19 and was used sparingly in the remainder of the regular season. Following the 1951 World Series, in which he played in all six games for the Giants but hit an anemic .136, he was traded to the Cardinals as player-manager.

In 1952, his Cardinals won seven more games than they had in 1951 and he was chosen Major League Manager of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. The Cards advanced from fourth to third place in the National League standings, although finishing 15 games behind the pennant-winning Dodgers. But Stanky&#x27;s time as Cardinal manager coincided with the slow decline of the team and its farm system from its glory days in the 1940s and the ownership transition from Fred Saigh to August &quot;Gussie&quot; Busch. On May 27, 1955, after a 17–19 start, he was fired.

Stanky then managed the Triple-A Minneapolis Millers (1956) before returning to the Majors as a coach for the Cleveland Indians (1957–58). He then spent almost six seasons in the Cardinal front office in charge of player development (1959–64), moving on to the New York Mets in a similar capacity in 1965.

In , he succeeded Al López as the Chicago White Sox&#x27; manager. The White Sox had been runners-up in the American League (AL) for three successive seasons (1963–65), averaging almost 96 victories per year, but Stanky&#x27;s maiden squad won only 83 games and fell to fourth place. However, his 1967 White Sox team — built on speed and pitching but hampered by an impotent offense — contended for the pennant until the last week of the season in a thrilling four-team race. But they lost their last five games to the lowly Kansas City Athletics and Washington Senators, and finished three games behind the surprise pennant winners, the &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; Boston Red Sox.

In 1968, the White Sox got off to a terrible start, losing their first ten games (extending their regular-season losing streak to 15 games dating from 1967). They recovered slightly but were only 34–45 on July 11, when Stanky was fired and López came out of retirement to reclaim his old job. One of his players, Tommy John, recalled that &quot;When Eddie Stanky took over as manager of the White Sox in 1966, people would tell me what an absolute tyrant he was, an S.O.B., a slave driver. Yet I probably learned more baseball under Eddie than any manager I ever played for. I wish I could have played for him ten years. He was just that good.&quot;

Stanky used to have pitchers throw batting practice without a protective screen, presumably to encourage toughness. He expected his players to know the statistics of the opposing team. A pet peeve of his was when he would see players reading the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;. &quot;Guys today are more worried about their investments than they are about their batting averages,&quot; Stanky complained.

==Success as college baseball coach==
After his firing in Chicago, Stanky became the head baseball coach of the University of South Alabama in 1969, compiling a 490–195-2 (.714) record with five NCAA baseball tournament appearances over 14 seasons. He returned to MLB on June 22, 1977, as manager of the Texas Rangers, replacing Frank Lucchesi who was dismissed earlier that day despite the team being four games out of first place in the AL West. The 10–8 victory over the Minnesota Twins at Metropolitan Stadium later that night was the only Rangers game he would manage. He submitted his resignation due to homesickness the following day on June 23 and returned to college coaching at South Alabama. His 18 hours on the job is one of the shortest managerial stints in MLB history. According to Leo Durocher&#x27;s autobiography, Stanky quit because he couldn&#x27;t adapt to the attitudes of modern baseball players. He was succeeded on an interim basis by third‐base coach Connie Ryan and a more permanent one by Billy Hunter four days later on June 27. His career MLB managerial mark was 467–435 (.518).

Stanky was inducted into the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame in 1990. He died of a heart attack in 1999 at age 83 in Fairhope, Alabama. He was buried in the Catholic Cemetery of Mobile.

Eddie Stanky Field, the ballpark of the University of South Alabama baseball team, is named for him.

==Managerial record==
==Legacy==
Stanky was good friends with Alvin Dark, his roommate when the two played together on the Braves and Giants. As players, both dreamed of managing major league teams one day, and Dark spoke highly of Stanky&#x27;s baseball intelligence. &quot;Stanky knew so much more about the game than anybody else. If there were ten possible percentage plays to make, most guys would know four or five. Stanky would know ten.&quot; After their careers, the two did not correspond as much; Dark speculated this was because of his divorce, as Stanky was a devout Catholic.

<text>Ronald George Smith (1928 – 10 January 2019) was an English comic artist whose career spanned almost fifty years. Primarily producing strips for the two main publishers, DC Thomson and IPC Magazines, Smith was best known for drawing Judge Dredd for &quot;2000 AD&quot; and the &quot;Daily Star&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life and work===
Smith was born in Bournemouth in 1928, the son of a structural engineer. He studied to become an engineer himself, but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Smith enlisted as a pilot with the Empire Flying Training Programme, and ended up flying mark 19 Spitfires (a photo-reconnaissance model). He was demobbed in 1947, and joined the Gaumont British animation studio, alongside future comics artists Mike Western and Eric Bradbury.

After Gaumont British&#x27;s parent company, the Rank Organisation, went bust in 1949, Smith found work drawing comics for the Amalgamated Press under editor Leonard Matthews, starting on &quot;Knockout&quot; with humour strips like &quot;Deed-a-Day Danny&quot; and &quot;Young Joey&quot;. His first adventure strip was an adaptation of the Burt Lancaster film &quot;The Flame and the Arrow&quot; in 1951. More adventure work, including &quot;Ryan of the Redcoats&quot; and adaptations of the western films &quot;Buffalo Stampede&quot; and &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; for &quot;The Comet&quot;, followed. He also contributed art for the &quot;Eagle&quot;.

===D. C. Thomson===
In 1952 he was hired by D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. as an illustrator for boys&#x27; story papers like &quot;Hotspur&quot;, &quot;Adventure&quot; and &quot;The Wizard&quot; under editor R. D. Low. Smith was now married with a child and no longer wanted to live in bomb-damaged London, so Thomsons bought him a house outside Dundee, where they had their headquarters, paid for from deductions from his wages. He also drew for their girls&#x27; comics &quot;Bunty&quot; and &quot;Judy&quot;.

In 1963 he was sent to South Africa by &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper to find Jeannie Stewart of the anti-apartheid group Black Sash, who had been sending the paper material but had been stopped by the South African authorities. Because his passport gave his profession as &quot;artist&quot;, rather than &quot;journalist&quot;, it was felt he would arouse less suspicion. He found her and, after going on safari in the Kruger National Park to maintain his cover as a tourist, was able to bring some material back for the paper.

In 1972 he left D. C. Thomson&#x27;s staff and went freelance, moving to Surrey, although he continued to draw for Thomsons&#x27; comics, primarily &quot;Hotspur&quot;. Strips he drew included &quot;The Cowboy Cricketer&quot;, and &quot;Nick Jolly&quot;, a fantasy story about an eighteenth-century highwayman brought forward in time by well-meaning aliens to fight the sinister arch-villain Simon Death on his robotic, jet-powered horse Bess. He pushed for Thomsons to publish superhero strips, and was eventually given the go-ahead to create &quot;King Cobra&quot;, who first appeared in &quot;Hotspur&quot; in 1976 and ran until 1980. Other titles he drew for include humour titles The Topper, The Dandy and The Beezer, and boys&#x27; adventure titles &quot;The Victor&quot; and &quot;Warlord&quot;, for which he drew &quot;Drake of E-Boat Alley&quot; and &quot;Codename Warlord&quot;. He also did some uncredited work for Marvel Comics in the USA.

===&quot;2000 AD&quot;===
In 1979 he began drawing &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; for IPC&#x27;s &quot;2000 AD&quot;, and during the early to mid-1980s, Ron Smith was among the most prolific artists working on the character. Along with Brian Bolland and Mike McMahon he contributed to two of the character&#x27;s most popular epic-length stories, &quot;The Day the Law Died&quot; and &quot;The Judge Child&quot;.

Amongst the more grotesque characters created by Smith was Otto Sump, Mega-City One&#x27;s ugliest man, with Smith excelling himself in &quot;The Otto Sump Ugly Clinic&quot; depicting the horrific length citizens of the metropolis go to in making themselves look as physically repulsive as possible. Smith was responsible for the majority of ugly-spin-off stories including &quot;Gunge&quot;, &quot;Who Killed Pug Ugly?&quot; about an ugly pop star and &quot;The League of Fatties&quot; about over-eaters gone to extremes (although the first Fatty story was actually drawn by McMahon in a previous Annual). The &quot;Get Ugly!&quot; 2000AD cover has been used at least twice as a T-shirt design. Other Dredd stories which featured Smith at the peak of his powers were the Pat Mills scripted &quot;Blood of Satanus&quot; where he more than effectively depicted a man&#x27;s transformation into a blood-thirsty &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, &quot;The Hot-Dog Run&quot; featuring a group of cadet Judges on a training mission in the Cursed Earth and &quot;The Graveyard Shift&quot;, an extended narrative covering one typically crime-filled night in Mega-City One. Ron Smith also co-created the anti-hero Chopper in &quot;Unamerican Graffiti&quot; and Dave the orang-utan who became Mayor of Mega-City One. Smith also created some of the most memorable &quot;2000 AD&quot; cover images, and produced a number of other strips produced for the comic, including &quot;Rogue Trooper&quot; and &quot;Chronos Carnival&quot;.

Smith went on to draw for other IPC titles, including &quot;M.A.S.K.&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Wildcat&quot; and &quot;Toxic Crusaders&quot; before retiring in the 1990s.

===&quot;Daily Star&quot;===
Smith drew the weekly &quot;Dredd&quot; strip for the &quot;Daily Star&quot; newspaper.

<doc id="1243888" wikidata="Q5512443" url="?curid=1243888" title="G. Rollie White Coliseum">
<text>The G. Rollie White Coliseum was an on-campus arena at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas, in the United States. Often referred to as the &quot;Jollie Rollie&quot; or &quot;The Holler House on the Brazos&quot;, the arena was the home of Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s Aggie volleyball team, which played there since its inception in 1975 until 2009. Before the building of Reed Arena in 1998, G. Rollie White was also the home to the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. Demolition of the Coliseum in August, 2013 made way for the redevelopment of Kyle Field.

The building was built in 1954, and was located directly to the northeast of Kyle Field. The U-shaped building seated 7,800 in the main grandstand on three sides, with a small auxiliary bleacher section on the flat end of the building. The sandstone exterior was originally visible outside the northern corner of the field.

The renovation of the Memorial Student Center (MSC), directly to the north of where the coliseum stood, required the relocation of the campus bookstore, which occupied the arena floor at G. Rollie from the summer of 2009 until April 2012 when the MSC reopened. G. Rollie White hosted the NCAA volleyball tournament ten times.

In November 2012, the request for proposal to renovate Kyle Field called for the demolition of G. Rollie White. Began in August 2013, the demolition resulted in the removal of nine dual basketball-volleyball courts, fourteen racquetball-handball courts, four activity rooms, several classrooms, meeting rooms, and offices, although some of these were from the adjacent Read Building, which was also razed.

John David Crow, former Aggie football player and athletic director, regarded the demise of G. Rollie White as a farewell to an old friend: &quot;I hate to see anything demolished.&quot; Crow was present when G. Rollie White opened to replace DeWare Field House.

<text>Michael John &quot;Cub&quot; Koda (né Uszniewicz; October 1, 1948 – July 1, 2000) was an American rock and roll musician, songwriter, and critic. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine considered him best known for writing the song &quot;Smokin&#x27; in the Boys Room&quot;, recorded by his band Brownsville Station, which reached number 3 on the 1974 Billboard chart.

Offstage, Koda also co-wrote and edited the &quot;All Music Guide to the Blues&quot;, and &quot;Blues for Dummies&quot;, as well as selecting the tracks on the accompanying CDs. He also penned liner notes for bands such as the Trashmen, Jimmy Reed, J. B. Hutto, the Kingsmen, and the Miller Sisters.

==Early life==
Koda was born in 1948 in Detroit, Michigan, to parents George and Lois Uszniewicz. In 1957, George changed the family name to &quot;Koda,&quot; his mother&#x27;s maiden name. Koda became interested in music as a boy, already playing drums at the age of five. 

==Career==
While attending high school in Manchester, Michigan, Koda formed a rock group, the Del-Tinos, who released their first single, a cover of Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;Go Go Go,&quot; in 1963. They released two more singles before disbanding in 1966. After attending Northern Michigan University for a year, Koda relocated to Ann Arbor, Michigan.

===Brownsville Station===
Koda formed Brownsville Station in Ann Arbor in 1969. The band originally consisted of Koda, drummer T. J. Cronley, bassist Tony Driggins, guitarist Mike Lutz. Brownsville Station began performing throughout the American Midwest before releasing their first album, &quot;No BS&quot;, in 1970. The 1973 single &quot;Smokin&#x27; in the Boys Room&quot; remains their best-known song. It went to number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, sold over two million copies, and was later at hit for Mötley Crüe. They continued to perform until disbanding in 1979.

In the mid-1970s, Koda and Brownsville Station roadies created and recorded an intentionally inept oldies band named &quot;King Uszniewicz and His Uszniewicztones&quot; with Koda masquerading as frontman Ernie Uszniewicz on saxophone. The band recorded and pressed a 45 of &quot;Surfin&#x27; School/Cry on My Shoulder&quot; which was discreetly placed in Midwest thrift stores by members of Brownsville Station while on tour, creating the illusion amongst record collectors that the band had been real. The prank was furthered by four LPs released by Norton Records between 1989 and 2011, all of which feature a photo of the face of Koda&#x27;s father George on the cover.

===After Brownsville Station===
After the breakup of Brownsville Station, Koda began producing one-man band tapes of rockabilly, blues, R&amp;B, country, early rock and roll, and jazz, which he released as the album &quot;That&#x27;s What I Like About the South&quot;. He also began writing for numerous music magazines, notably his column &quot;The Vinyl Junkie&quot; for &quot;Goldmine Magazine&quot; (later for &quot;DISCoveries&quot;). He wrote three volumes of the acclaimed &quot;Blues Masters&quot; series. He also wrote reviews and contributed to books published by AllMusic.

From late 1979 to late 1980, Koda began playing with three members of a Detroit-based band, Mugsy, calling themselves Cub Koda and the Points. Their eponymous debut album was released in early 1980 by the Boston-based Baron Records on hot pink vinyl. Also released was an EP, &quot;Shake Yo Cakes&quot;.

By 1980, Koda was performing with Hound Dog Taylor&#x27;s backing band, the Houserockers, with guitarist Brewer Phillips and drummer Ted Harvey. They performed and recorded together for 15 years. The group&#x27;s first album was &quot;It&#x27;s the Blues&quot;, released in 1981. Their second album, &quot;The Joint Was Rockin&quot;&#x27;, was released in 1996. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Koda continued his busy schedule of touring, recording, and writing. The compilation album &quot;Smokin&#x27; in the Boy&#x27;s Room: The Best of Brownsville Station&quot;, was released by Rhino Records in 1993, and &quot;Welcome to My Job&quot;, a retrospective of his non-Brownsville recordings, was released by Blue Wave Records in the same year. The following year the album &quot;Abba Dabba Dabba: A Bananza of Hits&quot; was released by Schoolkids Records. He recorded a solo album, &quot;Box Lunch&quot;, released by J-Bird Records in 1997, and recordings he made with the Del-Tinos were released by Norton Records in 1998. He also re-formed Cub Koda and the Points and released &quot;Noise Monkeys&quot; (one of his last works) in 2000.

==Death==
Koda died in Chelsea, Michigan, on July 1, 2000, aged 51. He had been suffering from kidney disease, which required dialysis. He is buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in Waterloo, Michigan. His headstone features a Fender amp, with a microphone and harmonica resting on top of it. &quot;I Will Always Love You/If Only in my Dreams&quot; is inscribed on the tablet. Koda was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2016.

<text>Long Key is an island in the middle Florida Keys. Long Key was called Cayo Víbora (Rattlesnake Key) by early Spanish explorers, a reference to the shape of the island, which resembles a snake with its jaws open, rather than to its denizens. The city of Layton is located on Long Key. The state park (3.9 km2) was dedicated October 1, 1969.

U.S. 1 (or the Overseas Highway) crosses the key at approximately mile markers 65.5--71, between Fiesta Key and Conch Key. It is the home of Long Key State Park, a favorite of campers and nature lovers, the camp sites are on the beach but the proximity of US1 makes it noisy. It is smaller and less developed than the neighboring incorporated village of Islamorada to the northeast and city of Marathon to the southwest.

== History ==
It was visited by C.W. Pierce in his boat, Bonton (1885). He stopped at the lower end of the key where there was a house with a cistern and replenished his water supply.

The key was a depot site during the railroad years, and it was also the site of the well known Long Key Fishing Camp.

==Education==
It is in the Monroe County School District. It is zoned to Plantation Key Elementary School (K-8) in Plantation Key.

<doc id="1243893" wikidata="Q21106117" url="?curid=1243893" title="RNA-induced silencing complex">
<text>The RNA-induced silencing complex, or RISC, is a multiprotein complex, specifically a ribonucleoprotein, which functions in gene silencing via a variety of pathways at the transcriptional and translational levels. Using single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) fragments, such as microRNA (miRNA), or double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA), the complex functions as a key tool in gene regulation. The single strand of RNA acts as a template for RISC to recognize complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. Once found, one of the proteins in RISC, Argonaute, activates and cleaves the mRNA. This process is called RNA interference (RNAi) and it is found in many eukaryotes; it is a key process in defense against viral infections, as it is triggered by the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).

==Discovery==
The biochemical identification of RISC was conducted by Gregory Hannon and his colleagues at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. This was only a couple of years after the discovery of RNA interference in 1998 by Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, who shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Hannon and his colleagues attempted to identify the RNAi mechanisms involved in gene silencing, by dsRNAs, in &quot;Drosophila&quot; cells. &quot;Drosophila&quot; S2 cells were transfected with a &quot;lacZ&quot; expression vector to quantify gene expression with β-galactosidase activity. Their results showed co-transfection with &quot;lacZ&quot; dsRNA significantly reduced β-galactosidase activity compared to control dsRNA. Therefore, dsRNAs control gene expression via sequence complementarity.

S2 cells were then transfected with &quot;Drosophila&quot; cyclin E dsRNA. Cycline E is an essential gene for cell cycle progression into the S phase. Cyclin E dsRNA arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase (before the S phase). Therefore, RNAi can target endogenous genes.

In addition, cyclin E dsRNA only diminished cyclin E RNA — a similar result was also shown using dsRNA corresponding to cyclin A which acts in S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. This shows the characteristic hallmark of RNAi: the reduced levels of mRNAs correspond to the levels of dsRNA added.

To test whether their observation of decreased mRNA levels was a result of mRNA being targeted directly (as suggested by data from other systems), &quot;Drosophila&quot; S2 cells were transfected with either &quot;Drosophila&quot; cyclin E dsRNAs or &quot;lacZ&quot; dsRNAs and then incubated with synthetic mRNAs for cyclin E or &quot;lacZ&quot;.

Cells transfected with cyclin E dsRNAs only showed degradation in cyclin E transcripts — the &quot;lacZ&quot; transcripts were stable. Conversely, cells transfected with &quot;lacZ&quot; dsRNAs only showed degradation in &quot;lacZ&quot; transcripts and not cyclin E transcripts. Their results led Hannon and his colleagues to suggest RNAi degrades target mRNA through a &#x27;sequence-specific nuclease activity&#x27;. They termed the nuclease enzyme RISC. Later Devanand Sarkar and his colleagues Prasanna K. Santhekadur and Byoung Kwon Yoo at the Virginia Commonwealth University elucidated the RISC activity and its molecular mechanism in cancer cells and they identified another new component of the RISC, called AEG-1 [47].

==Function in RNA interference==
=== Incorporation of siRNA/miRNA ===
The RNase III Dicer is a critical member of RISC that initiates the RNA interference process by producing double-stranded siRNA or single-stranded miRNA. Enzymatic cleavage of dsRNA within the cell produces the short siRNA fragments of 21-23 nucleotides in length with a two-nucleotide 3&#x27; overhang. Dicer also processes pre-miRNA, which forms a hairpin loop structure to mimic dsRNA, in a similar fashion. dsRNA fragments are loaded into RISC with each strand having a different fate based on the asymmetry rule phenomenon, the selection of one strand as the guide strand over the other based on thermodynamic stability. The newly generated miRNA or siRNA act as single-stranded guide sequences for RISC to target mRNA for degradation.

* The strand with the less thermodynamically stable 5&#x27; end is selected by the protein Argonaute and integrated into RISC. This strand is known as the guide strand and targets mRNA for degradation.
* The other strand, known as the passenger strand, is degraded by RISC.

===Gene regulation===

Major proteins of RISC, Ago2, SND1, and AEG-1, act as crucial contributors to the gene silencing function of the complex.

RISC uses the guide strand of miRNA or siRNA to target complementary 3&#x27;-untranslated regions (3&#x27;UTR) of mRNA transcripts via Watson-Crick base pairing, allowing it to regulate gene expression of the mRNA transcript in a number of ways.

====mRNA degradation====

The most understood function of RISC is degradation of target mRNA which reduces the levels of transcript available to be translated by ribosomes. The endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA complementary to the RISC&#x27;s guide strand by Argonaute protein is the key to RNAi initiation. There are two main requirements for mRNA degradation to take place:

* a near-perfect complementary match between the guide strand and target mRNA sequence, and,
* a catalytically active Argonaute protein, called a &#x27;slicer&#x27;, to cleave the target mRNA.

There are two major pathways of mRNA degradation once cleavage has occurred. Both are initiated through degradation of the mRNA&#x27;s poly(A) tail, resulting in removal of the mRNA&#x27;s 5&#x27; cap.

* 5&#x27;-to-3&#x27; degradation of the transcript occurs by XRN1 exonuclease in cytoplasmic bodies called P-bodies.
* 3&#x27;-to-5&#x27; degradation of the transcript is conducted by the exosome and Ski complex.

====Translational repression====
RISC can modulate the loading of ribosome and accessory factors in translation to repress expression of the bound mRNA transcript. Translational repression only requires a partial sequence match between the guide strand and target mRNA.

Translation can be regulated at the initiation step by:
*preventing the binding of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) to the 5&#x27; cap. It has been noted RISC can deadenylate the 3&#x27; poly(A) tail which might contribute to repression via the 5&#x27; cap.
* preventing the binding of the 60S ribosomal subunit binding to the mRNA can repress translation.

Translation can be regulated at post-initiation steps by:
* peptide degradation,
*promoting premature termination of translation ribosomes, or,
* slowing elongation.

There is still speculation on whether translational repression via initiation and post-initiation is mutually exclusive.

====Heterochromatin formation====
Some RISCs are able to directly target the genome by recruiting histone methyltransferases to form heterochromatin at the gene locus, silencing the gene. These RISCs take the form of a RNA-induced transcriptional silencing complex (RITS). The best studied example is with the yeast RITS.

RITS has been shown to direct heterochromatin formation at centromeres through recognition of centromeric repeats. Through base-pairing of siRNA (guide strand) to target chromatin sequences, histone-modifying enzymes can be recruited.

The mechanism is not well understood; however, RITS degrade nascent mRNA transcripts. It has been suggested this mechanism acts as a &#x27;self-reinforcing feedback loop&#x27; as the degraded nascent transcripts are used by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to generate more siRNAs.

In &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; and &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, the processing of dsRNA targets into siRNA by Dicer RNases can initiate a gene silencing pathway by heterochromatin formation. An Argonaute protein known as AGO4 interacts with the small RNAs that define heterochromatic sequences. A histone methyl transferase (HMT), H3K9, methylates histone H3 and recruits chromodomain proteins to the methylation sites. DNA methylation maintains the silencing of genes as the heterochromatin sequences can be established or spread.

====DNA elimination====
The siRNA generated by RISCs seem to have a role in degrading DNA during somatic macronucleus development in ciliates of the genus &quot;Tetrahymena&quot;. It is similar to the epigenetic control of heterochromatin formation and is implied as a defense against invading genetic elements.

Similar to heterochromatin formation in &quot;S. pombe&quot; and &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, a &quot;Tetrahymena&quot;  protein related to the Argonaute family, Twi1p, catalyzes DNA elimination of target sequences known as internal elimination sequences (IESs). Using methyltransferases and chromodomain proteins, IESs are heterochromatized and eliminated from the DNA.

==RISC-associated proteins==
The complete structure of RISC is still unsolved. Many studies have reported a range of sizes and components for RISC but it is not entirely sure whether this is due to there being a number of RISC complexes or due to the different sources that different studies use.


Regardless, it is apparent that Argonaute proteins are present and are essential for function. Furthermore, there are insights into some of the key proteins (in addition to Argonaute) within the complex, which allow RISC to carry out its function.

===Argonaute proteins===
Argonaute proteins are a family of proteins found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Their function in prokaryotes is unknown but in eukaryotes they are responsible for RNAi. There are eight family members in human Argonautes of which only Argonaute 2 is exclusively involved in targeted RNA cleavage in RISC.

===RISC-loading complex===
The RISC-loading complex (RLC) is the essential structure required to load dsRNA fragments into RISC in order to target mRNA. The RLC consists of dicer, the transactivating response RNA-binding protein (TRBP) and Argonaute 2.

* Dicer is an RNase III endonuclease which generates the dsRNA fragments to be loaded that direct RNAi.
* TRBP is a protein with three double-stranded RNA-binding domains. 
* Argonaute 2 is an RNase and is the catalytic centre of RISC.

Dicer associates with TRBP and Argonaute 2 to facilitate the transfer of the dsRNA fragments generated by Dicer to Argonaute 2.

More recent research has shown the human RNA helicase A could help facilitate the RLC.

===Other proteins===
Recently identified members of RISC are SND1 and MTDH. SND1 and MTDH are oncogenes and regulate various gene expression.

==Binding of mRNA==

It is as yet unclear how the activated RISC complex locates the mRNA targets in the cell, though it has been shown that the process can occur in situations outside of ongoing protein translation from mRNA.

Endogenously expressed miRNA in metazoans is usually not perfectly complementary to a large number of genes and thus, they modulate expression via translational repression. However, in plants, the process has a much greater specificity to target mRNA and usually each miRNA only binds to one mRNA. A greater specificity means mRNA degradation is more likely to occur.

<text>Creep is a 2004 horror film written and directed by Christopher Smith. The film follows a woman locked in the London Underground overnight. She later finds herself being stalked by a hideously deformed killer living in the sewers below. The film was first shown at the Frankfurt Fantasy Film festival in Germany on 10 August 2004.

==Plot==
Arthur and George are London sewage workers who discover a tunnel in one of the walls. Arthur starts exploring the tunnel alone, while newbie George stays behind. After a while, George enters and discovers Arthur, injured and in shock. A similarly injured woman jumps out, crying for help, only to be pulled back into the darkness.

A young German woman, Kate, decides to join her friend at a party and heads to Charing Cross Underground station but falls asleep on the platform while waiting for the train. When she awakens, she is alone, and the entire station has been locked up for the night. An empty train arrives, and she boards it; it abruptly stops and the lights go dark. She meets Guy, a coworker who follows her and whose awkward advances she repeatedly rejects. Guy attempts to rape her, only to be stopped by an unseen aggressor who drags him out of the train. Guy briefly reemerges, covered in blood, warning Kate to run.

Kate flees and runs into a homeless Scottish couple living in a storeroom, Jimmy and Mandy, and their dog Ray. Jimmy reluctantly agrees to help her by taking her to the night guard after she pays him. They find Guy, horribly maimed but still alive. Mandy, left alone, is attacked and kidnapped, triggering Jimmy&#x27;s sorrow-fueled escape into a heroin-induced stupor. Kate manages to communicate with the security guard via intercom, but the guard is killed before he can call for help, while Guy dies of his injuries. Kate and Jimmy decide to walk through the tunnel to the next station. A train stops near them; Jimmy decides to face the killer to avenge Mandy, but he is slaughtered as well.

Fleeing, Kate falls into the sewer system below, where she finds Arthur&#x27;s body. She also finds a storage facility with hundreds of boxes, where she is captured by the killer, the titular &quot;creep&quot;—a hideously deformed, mentally ill hermit named Craig, who keeps his victims in semi-submerged, rat-infested cages until they are dead, after which he eats them. Kate is put in one of these cages, along with George. They escape and end up in an abandoned medical facility, where they find an unconscious Mandy strapped to a surgical chair. Thinking she is dead, they move on. Craig appears, puts on a surgical gown, and mimics the gestures of a surgeon in front of a terrorized Mandy before he disembowels her with a bone saw.

Kate and George find the disused railcar where Craig lives. The dog, Ray, is there, along with old pictures of a medical doctor with a deformed child. Craig ambushes them and kills George. In a last, desperate effort, Kate sinks a hook and chain into Craig&#x27;s throat, then has a running train rip it apart, and Craig bleeds to death. Disheveled, she returns to the initial station, by which point it is morning. She collapses on the platform, and Ray curls onto her lap. Mistaking her for a beggar, a man waiting for the train leaves her a coin, and Kate breaks into hysterical giggles and tears.

==Cast==
* Franka Potente as Kate
* Vas Blackwood as George
* Ken Campbell as Arthur
* Jeremy Sheffield as Guy
* Paul Rattray as Jimmy
* Kelly Scott as Mandy
* Joe Anderson as male model
* Sean Harris as Craig, the &quot;Creep&quot;
* Morgan Jones as the Night Watchman

==Production==

The storyline has been compared to the 1972 film &quot;Death Line&quot;, also set on the London Underground and featuring a cannibalistic killer. Director Smith, who had not seen &quot;Death Line&quot;, attributes his inspiration to a scene in &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; set in the London Underground.

==&quot;The Last Tube&quot;==
&quot;Creep: The Last Tube&quot; is a 2005 online 3D Shockwave horror game made to promote the film and was produced by Jail Dog. Nearly 14 years after the game went down, the website known as The Lost Media Wiki conducted a search for the game.

Beau Chesluk, a developer for the game, was eventually contacted, and after some searching he was able to locate the game files and send them to The Cracks Overhead. The game has since been uploaded to Archive.org.

==Reception==

===Critical response===

&quot;Creep&quot; has received generally mixed reviews from critics. It currently holds a 40% &#x27;rotten&#x27; rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews, and an average rating of 4.3/10.

&quot;Time Out&quot; gave the film a negative review, writing, &quot;this London Underground-set slasher squanders a promising premise for trashy shocks, old-school nastiness and a fistful of genre clichés.&quot;

All Movie&#x27;s review was favorable, writing, &quot;this pared-down shocker might be light on plot, but it&#x27;s packed with creepy frights and psychopathic attitude from its mean main monster.&quot;

Matthew Turner &quot;View London&quot; said &quot;The performances are good, particularly Potente, who avoids scream queen clichés by making her character surprisingly unlikeable - Kate is rude and arrogant in her early scenes and the fact that she&#x27;s German is, of course, a coincidence.&quot;

<doc id="1243905" wikidata="Q465882" url="?curid=1243905" title="Alpaida">
<text>Alpaida (also Alpaïde, Alpaide, Alphaida, Alpoïde, Elphide, Elfide, Alféïde, Chalpaida; 654 – c. 714) was a Frankish noblewoman who hailed from the Liège area. She became the second wife, concubine or mistress of Pepin of Herstal and mother to his son Charles Martel and possibly another, Childebrand I.

In the &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot; and the &quot;Continuations of Fredegar&quot; she is referred to as Pepin&#x27;s wife.

Saint Lambert of Maastricht was a vocal critic of the relationship between Pepin and Alpaida. A tradition would eventually develop that, Pepin&#x27;s &quot;domesticus&quot; (manager of state domains) Dodon, whose troops would murder Lambert, was in fact the brother of Alpaida; however, the historical accuracy of Dodon being her brother has been questioned.

==Notes==
According to Sara McDougall, the way many medieval sources define and use the terms &quot;second wife&quot;, &quot;concubine&quot; and &quot;mistress&quot; are unclear and do not align with how modern audiences understand and use those same terms in modern standards so it is unclear how medieval sources would have defined Alpaida&#x27;s role within Pepin II&#x27;s life in terms of their relationship.

It seems that in this time period, it was the mother and her lineage that shaped and determined the child&#x27;s possibility to inherit from their father, so to discredit the child&#x27;s claim to their father&#x27;s inheritance, one must discredit the mother. This is reflected in the historiography around Alpaida, who was once called a second wife in eighth-century writings, re-labeled a concubine in later ninth century writings, and finally, as a result of possible anti-Charles Martel or anti-Carolingian sentiment, tenth-century written sources now called Charles Martel&#x27;s legitimacy and claim to Pepin II&#x27;s inheritance into question by challenging Alpaida&#x27;s role within the Pippinid family.

<text>Germa (), known in ancient times as Garama, is an archaeological site in Libya. It was the capital of the Garamantian Kingdom.

The Garamantes were a Saharan Amazigh sub clan called Karra/Garre people living in the Fezzan in the northeastern Sahara Desert. Garamantian power climaxed during the second and the third centuries AD, often in conflict with the Roman Empire to the north. Garama had a population of some four thousand and another six thousand living in villages within a 5 km radius.

The Garamantes often conducted raids across Rome&#x27;s African frontier, the &quot;Limes Tripolitanus&quot;, and retreated to the safety of the desert. In 203, Roman Emperor Septimius Severus launched a campaign deep into the Sahara and captured Garama, but he soon abandoned it.

The city was conquered by Uqba ibn Nafi in 669 AD.

Archaeological work at Germa has most recently been conducted by Prof. David Mattingly&#x27;s Fazzan Project, which has continued the work of Charles Daniels and Mohammed Ayoub. The Fazzan Project has published four volumes based on its work, titled &quot;The Archaeology of Fazzān&quot;. Digital versions of these books have been made freely available under a policy of open access by the Society for Libian Studies.

The series is a prequel to the 1997 television series &quot;Yongzheng Dynasty&quot;, and was followed by &quot;Qianlong Dynasty&quot; in 2002.

==Plot==

==Production==
The series was partially produced on location at the House of the Huangcheng Chancellor in rural Shanxi, the home of Chen Tingjing, a minister of the Kangxi Emperor who served as the chief editor for his dictionary.

==Awards==
&quot;Kangxi Dynasty&quot; won the Outstanding Drama award at the 20th Golden Eagle Television Awards in 2002.

==Reception==
Although the series was generally popular, it received lower ratings than its predecessor, &quot;Yongzheng Dynasty&quot;, a similar television series about the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s son and successor, the Yongzheng Emperor. The series was criticised by some for being wrought with historical inaccuracies. Critics also pointed out its unnecessary emphasis on Taiwan, a contemporary issue. Some major events during Kangxi&#x27;s reign were omitted, such as his contributions to the Chinese language with the Kangxi Dictionary, and the contention for the succession among Kangxi&#x27;s sons, which is featured more prominently in &quot;Yongzheng Dynasty&quot;.

<doc id="1243934" wikidata="Q2757712" url="?curid=1243934" title="History of the London Underground">
<text>The history of the London Underground began in the 19th century with the construction of the Metropolitan Railway, the world&#x27;s first underground railway. The Metropolitan Railway, which opened in 1863 using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives, worked with the District Railway to complete London&#x27;s Circle line in 1884. Both railways expanded, the Metropolitan eventually extending as far as in Buckinghamshire, more than from Baker Street and the centre of London. The first deep-level tube line, the City and South London Railway, opened in 1890 with electric trains. This was followed by the Waterloo &amp; City Railway in 1898, the Central London Railway in 1900, and the Great Northern and City Railway in 1904. The Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was established in 1902 to fund the electrification of the District Railway and to complete and operate three tube lines, the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway, the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, which closed during 1906–1907. By 1907, the District and Metropolitan Railways had electrified the underground sections of their lines.

Under a joint marketing agreement between most of the companies in the early years of the 20th century, UD signs appeared outside stations in central London. The First World War delayed extensions of the Bakerloo and Central London Railways, and people used the tube stations as shelters during Zeppelin air raids by June 1915. After the war, government-backed financial guarantees were used to expand the network, and the tunnels of the City and South London and Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railways were linked at Euston and Kennington, although the combined service was not named the Northern line until later. The Piccadilly line was extended north to Cockfosters and took over District line branches to Harrow (later Uxbridge) and Hounslow. In 1933, the underground railways and all London area tram and bus operators were merged into the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). The outlying branches of the Metropolitan were closed; various upgrades were planned. The Bakerloo line&#x27;s extension to take over the Metropolitan&#x27;s Stanmore branch, and extensions of the Central and Northern lines, formed part of the 1930s New Works Programme. The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 interrupted some of this work; many tube stations were used as air raid shelters during the conflict.

The LPTB was nationalised during 1948, and the reconstruction of the mainline railways was given priority over the maintenance of the Underground. In 1953, an unpainted aluminium train entered service on the District line, and this became the standard for new trains. In the early 1960s, the Metropolitan line was electrified as far as Amersham, and steam locomotives no longer hauled passenger trains. The Victoria line, a new tube line across central London, opened in 1968–71 with trains driven automatically. In 1976, the isolated Northern City Line was taken over by British Rail and linked up with the mainline railway at Finsbury Park. In 1979, another new route, the Jubilee line, took over part of the Bakerloo line; it was extended through the Docklands to Stratford in 1999.

Under the control of the Greater London Council, London Transport introduced in 1981 a system of fare zones for buses and underground trains that cut the average fare. Fares increased following a legal challenge but the fare zones were retained, and during the mid-1980s the Travelcard and the Capitalcard were introduced. In the early years of the 21st century, London Underground was reorganised in a public–private partnership where private companies upgraded and maintained the infrastructure. In 2003, control passed to Transport for London (TfL), which had been opposed to the arrangement and, following financial failure of the infrastructure companies, had taken full responsibility by 2010. The contactless Oyster card first went on sale in 2003. The East London line closed during 2007 to be converted into a London Overground line, and in December 2009 the Circle line changed from serving a closed loop around the centre of London to a spiral also serving Hammersmith. Currently there is an upgrade programme to increase capacity on several Underground lines, and work concluded in 2021 on a Northern line extension to Battersea.

==The first underground railways (1863–1905)==

During the first half of the 19th century, London had grown greatly and the development of a commuting population arriving by train each day led to traffic congestion with carts, cabs and omnibuses filling the roads. By 1850, there were seven railway termini located around the urban centre of London and the concept of an underground railway linking the City of London with these stations was first proposed in the 1830s. Charles Pearson, Solicitor to the City of London, was a leading promoter of several schemes, and he contributed to the creation of the City Terminus Company to build such a railway from Farringdon to King&#x27;s Cross in 1852. Although the plan was supported by the City of London, the railway companies were not interested and the company struggled to proceed. During 1854, the Metropolitan Railway (also known as the &quot;Met&quot;) was granted permission to build an underground line at an estimated cost of £1 million. With the Crimean War under way, the Met found it hard to raise the capital, and construction did not start until March 1860. The railway was mostly built using the &quot;cut-and-cover&quot; method from Paddington to King&#x27;s Cross; east of King&#x27;s Cross it was built by tunnelling and then followed the culverted River Fleet in an open cutting to the new meat market at Smithfield. The railway opened to the public on 10 January 1863, using steam locomotives hauling wooden carriages. It was hailed as a success, carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day, borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service. In the first twelve months 9.5 million passengers were carried and in the second twelve months this increased to 12 million.

The Met&#x27;s early success prompted a flurry of applications to Parliament during 1863 for various new railways in London, many competing for similar routes. The House of Lords established a select committee that recommended an &quot;inner circuit of railway that should abut, if not actually join, nearly all of the principal railway termini in the Metropolis&quot;. Proposals to extend the Met were accepted, and the committee agreed a proposal that a new company, the &quot;Metropolitan District Railway&quot; (commonly known as the District Railway), be formed to complete the circuit. Initially, the District and the Met were closely associated and it was intended that they would merge. The Met&#x27;s chairman and three other directors were on the board of the District, John Fowler was the engineer of both companies. The construction works for the extensions were let as a single contract and the Met initially operated all the services. Struggling under the burden of high construction costs, the District&#x27;s level of debt meant that merger was no longer attractive to the Met and its directors resigned from the District&#x27;s board. To improve its finances, the District terminated the operating agreement and began operating its own trains. Conflict between the Met and the District and the expense of construction delayed further progress on the completion of the &quot;inner circle&quot;. By 1879, the Met was seeking to access the South Eastern Railway via the East London Railway (ELR); an Act of Parliament was obtained to complete the circle and link to the ELR. After an official opening ceremony on 17 September and trial running, a complete Circle line service started on 6 October 1884.

The Metropolitan Railway had been extended soon after opening, reaching Hammersmith with the Great Western Railway in 1864 and Richmond over the tracks of the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR) in 1877. The Metropolitan &amp; St John&#x27;s Wood Railway opened as a single track branch from Baker Street to Swiss Cottage, and this was to become the Met&#x27;s most important route as it expanded north into the Middlesex countryside, where it stimulated the development of new suburbs. Harrow was reached during 1880, and the line eventually extended as far as in Buckinghamshire, more than from Baker Street and the centre of London. From the end of the 19th century, the railway shared tracks with the Great Central Railway route out of .

By 1871, when the District began operating its own trains, the railway had extended to West Brompton and a terminus at Mansion House. Hammersmith was reached from Earl&#x27;s Court and services reached Richmond, Ealing, Hounslow and Wimbledon. As part of the project that completed the Circle line in October 1884, the District began to serve Whitechapel. As a result of the expansion, by 1898, 550 trains operated daily. Services began running to Upminster in 1902, after a link to the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend Railway had been built.
==Electric underground railways (1900–1908)==

===Deep-level tubes===

During 1869, a passage was dug through the London Clay under the Thames from Great Tower Hill to Pickle Herring Stairs near Vine Street (now Vine Lane). A circular tunnel was dug , using a wrought iron shield, a method that had been patented in 1864 by Peter William Barlow. A railway was laid in the tunnel and from August 1870 a wooden carriage conveyed passengers from one side to the other. This was uneconomic and the company went bankrupt by the end of the year and the tunnel was converted to pedestrian use, becoming known as the Tower Subway. Construction of the City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) was started in 1886 by James Henry Greathead using a development of Barlow&#x27;s shield. Two circular tunnels were dug between King William Street (close to today&#x27;s Monument station) and Elephant and Castle. From Elephant and Castle, the tunnels were a slightly larger to Stockwell. This was a legacy of the original intention to haul the trains by cable. The tunnels were bored under the roads to avoid the need for agreement with owners of property on the surface. The original intention to cable-haul the trains changed to electric power when the cable company went bankrupt. A conductor rail energised with +500 volts DC conductor rail for the northbound tunnel and −500 volts for the southbound laid between the running rails, though offset from the centreline, powered the electric locomotives that hauled the carriages. The carriages were fitted with small windows and consequently were nicknamed &quot;padded cells&quot;. By 1907, the C&amp;SLR had extended from both ends, south to Clapham Common and north to Euston.

In 1898, the Waterloo &amp; City Railway was opened between London &amp; South Western Railway&#x27;s terminus at Waterloo station and a station in the City. Operated by the L&amp;SWR, the short electrified line used four-car electric multiple units. Two diameter tunnels were dug beneath the roads between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Bank for the Central London Railway (CLR). In 1900 this opened, charging a flat fare of 2d (approximately p today), becoming known as the &quot;Twopenny tube&quot; and by the end of the year carrying nearly 15 million passengers. Initially electric locomotives hauled carriages, but the heavy locomotives caused vibrations that could be felt on the surface. During 1902–1903, the carriages were reformed into multiple units using a control system developed by Frank Sprague in Chicago. The CLR was extended to Wood Lane (near White City) in 1908 and Liverpool Street in 1912. The Great Northern &amp; City Railway was built to take main line trains from the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at Finsbury Park to the City at a terminus at Moorgate. However, the GNR refused permission for trains to use its Finsbury Park station, so platforms were built beneath the station instead and public service on the line, using electric multiple units, began in 1904.

===District and Metropolitan electrification===

On the District and Metropolitan Railways, the use of steam locomotives led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the way forward. Electric traction was still in its infancy and agreement would be needed between the two companies because of the shared ownership of the &quot;inner circle&quot;. A tender was announced for an electric system, and the largest European and American companies applied to win the contract. When the experts of the London Metro compared the design of the Ganz Works to the offers of the other large European and American competitors, however, they found that the newest type of AC traction technology of the Ganz Works was more reliable and cheaper, and considered its technology as a &quot;revolution in electric railway traction&quot;. During 1901, a Metropolitan and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. Initially this was accepted by both parties, until the District found an investor, the American Charles Yerkes, to finance the upgrade. Yerkes raised £1 million (adjusted for inflation, £) and soon had control of the District Railway. His experiences in the United States led him to favour the classic traditional DC system similar to that in use on the City &amp; South London Railway and Central London Railway. The Metropolitan Railway protested about the change of plan, but after arbitration by the Board of Trade the DC system was adopted.

The Metropolitan electrified its new line from Harrow to Uxbridge and the route to the inner circle at Baker Street, using separate positive and negative conductor rails energised at 550–600 V. The District electrified its unopened line from Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town) to South Harrow and used this line to test its new trains and to train drivers. Electric multiple units began running on the Metropolitan in January 1905 and by March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. Electric services began on the District Railway in June 1905 between Hounslow and South Acton. In July 1905, the District began running electric trains from Ealing to Whitechapel and on the same day the Met and the District both introduced electric units on the inner circle until later that day an incompatibility was found between the way the shoe-gear was mounted on the Met trains and the District track. The Met trains were withdrawn from the District lines and modified, full electric service starting on the circle line in September. In the same month, after withdrawing services over the un-electrified East London Railway and east of East Ham, the District were running electric services on all remaining routes. The GWR electrified the line between Paddington and Hammersmith and the branch from Latimer Road to Kensington (Addison Road). An electric service with jointly owned rolling stock started on the route in November 1906. During the same year, the Met suspended running on the East London Railway, terminating instead at the District&#x27;s station at Whitechapel. The Metropolitan Railway beyond Harrow was not electrified so services were hauled by an electric locomotive from Baker Street and changed for a steam locomotive en route.

==Integration (1902–1933)==

===Underground Electric Railways Company of London===
The Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway, was authorised from Charing Cross to Hampstead and Highgate in 1893, but had not found financial backing. Yerkes bought the rights in 1900, and obtained additional approval for a branch from Camden Town to Golders Green. The Baker Street and Waterloo Railway had been authorised to run from Baker Street to Waterloo station. Work began in 1898, and extensions to Paddington station and Elephant &amp; Castle were authorised in 1900, but came to a halt with the collapse of their financial backers during 1901. Yerkes bought the rights to this railway in 1902. The District had permission for a deep-level tube from Earl&#x27;s Court to Mansion House and in 1898 had bought the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway that had authority for a tube from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus. The District&#x27;s plans were combined by Yerkes with those of the Great Northern and Strand Railway, a tube railway with permission to build a line from Strand to Finsbury Park, to create the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. In April 1902, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was established, with Yerkes as chairman, to control these companies and manage the planned works.

On 8 June 1902, the UERL took over the Metropolitan District Traction Company. The UERL built a large power station that would be capable of providing power for the District and underground lines under construction. Work began in 1902 at Lots Road, by Chelsea Creek, and in February 1905 Lots Road Power Station began generating electricity. For the three lines similar electric multiple units were purchased, known as &quot;Gate Stock&quot; as access to the cars was via lattice gates at each end operated by gatemen. As on the District Railway the track was provided with separate positive and negative conductor rails, in what was to become a London Underground standard. A number of the surface buildings, with an exterior of glazed dark red bricks, were designed by Leslie Green and 140 electric lifts were imported from America from the Otis Elevator Company. A length of the Baker Street &amp; Waterloo between Baker Street and Kennington Road (now Lambeth North) opened in March 1906, and the line reached Edgware Road the following year. It was named the &#x27;Bakerloo&#x27; in July 1906, called an undignified &quot;gutter title&quot; by &quot;The Railway Magazine&quot;. The Great Northern, Piccadilly &amp; Brompton Railway (the Piccadilly) opened from Finsbury Park to Hammersmith in December 1906, the Aldwych branch opening the following year. &quot;Moving staircases&quot; or escalators were first installed at Earl&#x27;s Court between the District and Piccadilly line platforms, and at all deep level tube stations after 1912. The last, the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead (the Hampstead) opened in 1907, and ran from to Camden Town, before splitting into two branches going to Golders Green and Highgate (now Archway).

===London Underground===

To promote travel by the underground railways in London, a joint marketing arrangement was agreed that included maps, joint publicity and through ticketing. UD signs were used outside stations in Central London. The UERL acquired London bus and tram companies in 1912 and the following year the City &amp; South London and Central London Railway joined the company. That year the Great Northern &amp; City was taken over by the Met. Suggestions of merger with the Underground Group were rejected by the Metropolitan, a press release of November 1912 noting its interests in areas outside London, its relationships with main line railways and its freight business. Further coordination in the form of a General Managers&#x27; Conference faltered after the Metropolitan withdrew in 1911 when the Central London Railway, without any reference to the conference, set its season ticket prices significantly lower than those on the Met&#x27;s competing routes. The UERL introduced station name boards with a red disc and a blue bar and the Met responded with station boards showing a blue bar on a red diamond.

During 1913, the Bakerloo line reached Paddington, and the following year the Hampstead line was extended south of its Charing Cross terminus to an expanded interchange station (currently known as Embankment) with the Bakerloo and District lines. The Bakerloo line was extended north to Queen&#x27;s Park to link up with the London &amp; North Western Railway&#x27;s new electric line from Euston to Watford Junction. The start of the First World War in July 1914 delayed construction, trains reaching Queen&#x27;s Park in 1915 and in 1917. An extension of the Central line west to Ealing was started in 1913 and, also delayed by the war, was completed in 1920. The war saw growth in traffic and a shortage of men, so women were recruited as temporary replacements in traditional men&#x27;s jobs such as guards, clerks, painters and cleaners. London saw its first air raids in 1915, and people used the tube stations as improvised bomb shelters.

After the conflict, new trains were purchased to run on the Metropolitan, District, Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines, the Piccadilly line trains having air-operated sliding doors. In the 1920s, taking advantage of government backed financial guarantees for capital projects that promoted employment, there were major extensions of the City &amp; South London and the Hampstead lines. The tunnels of the City &amp; South London Railway were rebuilt to have the same diameter of the other tubes, and then extended north from Euston to a junction with the Hampstead line at Camden Town, and south to Morden. The Hampstead line was extended to the north from Golders Green to Edgware and south to another junction with the City &amp; South London at Kennington, this opening in 1926. Although physically connected, the lines were still officially named the City Railway and Hampstead &amp; Highgate line. The lines were to be known as the Edgware, Highgate and Morden and the Morden-Edgware until finally renamed the Northern line in 1937. Also during the 1920s, the original tube gate stock was replaced with 1,460 cars of Standard Stock with air-operating sliding doors, except for the Central line where the cars were refurbished. Busy central London stations were modernised with escalators replacing lifts.

Unlike other railway companies in the London area, the Met was able to develop land for housing. After the First World War, they promoted housing estates near the railway with the &quot;Metro-land&quot; brand and nine housing estates were built near stations on the line. Taking advantage of the Treasury guarantees electrification was extended north from Harrow to Rickmansworth and a short branch opened from Rickmansworth to Watford in 1925. During the 1920s, more powerful electric and steam locomotives were purchased and Metropolitan Railway stations were redesigned by their architect Charles W Clark.

With finance guaranteed by the government, the Piccadilly lines and Metropolitan were extended in the early 1930s. The Metropolitan opened a line from Wembley Park to Stanmore, and the Piccadilly line was to extend north from Finsbury Park to Cockfosters and west from Hammersmith and took over the District line Harrow and Hounslow branches. Several stations were rebuilt in a Modernist style influenced or designed by Charles Holden, who called them his &#x27;brick boxes with concrete lids&#x27;. Piccadilly line trains took over the District service to South Harrow in 1932, reaching Uxbridge the following year. Piccadilly trains reached Cockfosters and Hounslow West in 1933, although District line services to Hounslow continued until 1964.

==London Passenger Transport Board (1933–1947)==
During 1933, Harry Beck&#x27;s diagrammatic tube map appeared for the first time. On 1 July 1933, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), was created as a public corporation and the Metropolitan, the UERL underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators were merged into one organisation. On the former Metropolitan Railway, the Brill Branch closed in 1935, followed by the line from to Verney Junction in 1936. It was proposed to electrify to Amersham with additional tracks from Harrow to Rickmansworth and to extend the Bakerloo line to Stanmore to relieve the bottleneck on the Metropolitan from Baker Street to Finchley. Before any work was started on the Met, the 1935–1940 New Works Programme was announced. This included extending the Central line to Stratford and then onto Epping and Ongar and the Northern line was to be extended north to High Barnet, Alexandra Palace and Bushey Heath and link up with the isolated Great Northern &amp; City Railway, renamed the Northern City Line, which was to be extended beyond Finsbury Park to link up at Highgate.

New trains were delivered before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, including 573 cars for the District and Metropolitan lines and 1,121 new cars (1938 Stock) for the tube lines. Following the outbreak of war, services on the Northern line between Strand (now Charing Cross) and Kennington were suspended as the tunnels under the Thames were blocked as a defence against flooding. The Metropolitan Pullman cars were placed into store and first class was removed from London Underground services. The New Works Programme continued, albeit at a reduced pace, the Bakerloo line taking over the Stanmore branch from the Metropolitan in November 1939. The Northern line reached Mill Hill East in May 1941, but by then, work on the other Northern and Central line extensions had been suspended. The bombing of London and especially the Blitz led to the use of many tube stations as air-raid shelters, with 175,000 people arriving every night in August 1940. Six stations were breached by a direct hit, and in March 1943, 173 people died in a crowd crush accident at the unfinished Bethnal Green station. In the 1940s, a depot built for the Northern line extension and an unfinished stretch of the Central line extension, the underground section between Newbury Park and Leytonstone, was turned into an aircraft factory. The closed Brompton Road station was used as an anti-aircraft control room. The closed Down Street station was used by Winston Churchill and the Railway Emergency Committee.

Before the conflict, the Olympia exhibition centre had been served by the Metropolitan line and by a service from Earl&#x27;s Court to . Following bombing during 1940, passenger services over the West London Line were suspended. This left the exhibition centre without a railway service so, after the war, the station was renamed Kensington (Olympia) and served by a District line shuttle from Earl&#x27;s Court. The Central line extensions in east and west London were completed, tube trains running to Epping from 1949.

==Nationalisation (1947–2000)==
Britain&#x27;s railways were nationalised on 1 January 1948, and London Transport placed under the authority of the British Transport Commission (BTC). The BTC prioritised the reconstruction of the main line railways over the maintenance of the Underground and most of the unfinished plans of the 1935–40 New Works Programme were shelved or postponed. For the tube lines, new cars (1949 Stock) were built to run with the 1938 stock. Some of the cars on the District line were in need of replacement, and in 1953 an unpainted aluminium train (R Stock) entered service, and this became the standard for new trains, and was followed by 1959 tube stock. After experiments with an AEC lightweight diesel multiple unit in 1952, steam trains were removed from the Central line following the electrification of the Epping–Ongar section during 1957.
Between 1963 and 1970, London Transport reported directly to the Minister of Transport, before control passed to the Greater London Council. Electrification work on the Metropolitan line, suspended due to the war, had restarted in 1959. The line was electrified to and the unpainted aluminium (A Stock) replaced steam trains, British Rail providing services for the former Metropolitan line stations between Amersham and .

===Victoria line and Jubilee line===
The Victoria line was recommended in a 1949 report as it would reduce congestion on other lines. After some experimental tunnelling during 1959, construction began in 1963 and, unlike the earlier tubes, the tunnels did not have to follow the roads above. The line was originally approved to run from Walthamstow to Victoria station, the extension to Brixton being authorised later. As part of the works, Oxford Circus station was rebuilt to allow interchange with the Central and Bakerloo lines. Cross platform interchanges were built at Euston, Highbury &amp; Islington and Finsbury Park. After running trains from Walthamstow, first to Finsbury Park and then to Warren Street in 1968, the line to Victoria was officially opened in March 1969. The extension to Brixton opened in 1971. Designed for automatic train operation, access to the platforms was by using magnetically encoded tickets collected by automatic gates.

The Moorgate tube crash occurred on 28 February 1975 on the isolated Northern City Line when a southbound train failed to stop at the Moorgate terminus and crashed into the wall at end of the tunnel, killing forty-four people. No fault was found with the train equipment, the subsequent report found that there was insufficient evidence to determine the cause. Following the incident, a system that stops a train automatically if the driver fails to brake was introduced at dead-ends on the London Underground. The Northern City Line was connected to British Rail tracks at Finsbury Park in the 1970s. The last tube train ran in October 1975, and British Rail services began in 1976. During 1977, the Piccadilly line was extended from Hounslow to Heathrow Airport, and in 1986 a platform serving Terminal 4 opened on a loop line.

The Fleet line through central London was first proposed during 1965, taking over the Bakerloo line&#x27;s Stanmore branch at Baker Street and then running via Fleet Street to Lewisham. To simplify planning the construction was divided into stages, and the first stage from Baker Street to Charing Cross had all the necessary approvals by 1971. Work began the following year and tunnelling had been completed in 1976. After the line had been renamed the Jubilee line in honour of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Silver Jubilee in 1977, it opened in April 1979 using trains that had been running on the Bakerloo line.

===1980s===
In 1981, the Greater London Council (GLC) introduced the &#x27;Fares Fair&#x27; scheme, a system of fare zones for bus and underground trains, cutting the average fare by 32 per cent. The GLC lost a legal challenge over this scheme, which led to fares being doubled during 1982. The fare zones were retained and fares dropped slightly the following year. During 1983, the Travelcard allowed travel within the specified zones on buses and underground trains, and was followed in Capitalcard in 1985 that included British Rail services. In 1984, control of London Buses and the London Underground passed to London Regional Transport (LRT), which reported directly to Secretary of State for Transport.

By the early 1980s, the pre-war trains had been replaced by new unpainted aluminium trains. One person operation had been planned in 1968, but conflict with the trade unions delayed introduction. The Metropolitan, East London, District and Circle lines were converted during 1985–1986, the Piccadilly, Jubilee and Bakerloo lines following in 1987–1988. One Person Operation was introduced on the Central and Northern lines after they received new trains in the early 1990s.

====King&#x27;s Cross fire====
On 18 November 1987, the King&#x27;s Cross fire, caused by a carelessly discarded lit match that set fire to a wooden escalator, killed 31 people. In the subsequent report, London Underground was strongly criticised for its attitude to fires and its publication led to resignations of senior management in both London Underground and London Regional Transport and to the introduction of new fire safety regulations. A Fire Safety Code of Practice was drawn up for rolling stock and this led to internal refurbishment of the trains that included replacing the interior panelling and fitting or improving the public address systems.

===1990s===
At the same time, the exterior of the trains were painted as it had proved difficult to remove graffiti from unpainted aluminium. The first refurbished trains were presented to the media in September 1989, and the project was launched during July 1991. In 1994, LRT took over control of the Waterloo and City line. The Epping–Ongar branch of the Central line and the Aldwych branch of the Piccadilly line closed in the same year. To link the growing Docklands area with central London, several options were considered, and an extension of the Jubilee line was chosen. Approved during 1993, the stations were built to be fully accessible and with platform edge doors. There was pressure on London Transport to get the line open in time for the opening of the Millennium Dome on 1 January 2000 and the extension opened in stages from Stratford, with through running from 22 November 1999, when the Charing Cross terminus closed.

==Transport for London (from 2000)==
Transport for London (TfL) was created during 2000 as part of the Greater London Authority by the Greater London Authority Act 1999. TfL eventually replaced London Regional Transport, and discontinued the use of the London Transport brand in favour of its own brand. The transfer of responsibility was staged, with transfer of control of London Underground delayed until July 2003, when London Underground Limited became an indirect subsidiary of TfL. 

===Public–private partnership===
====Creation====
During 1999, prior to control being passed to TfL, London Underground was split up so that a public–private partnership (PPP) arrangement could be put in place, under which London Underground remained a public company that ran the trains while private companies were responsible for upgrading the infrastructure, such as the lines, signals, and other systems. Ken Livingstone, who took office in 2000 as London&#x27;s first directly elected mayor, was skeptical about the practicality of the PPP plan, and brought in the American Bob Kiley as London&#x27;s Transport Commissioner to repeat his success with the New York City Subway using public bond finance. It was difficult for Livingstone to block the PPP process, which was entirely in the national Government&#x27;s hands as it still owned London Underground, which was not transferred to local control until July 2003. Kiley was fired from the board of London Regional Transport (of which he had been chairman) during 2001 over his attempts to block the PPP scheme. Livingstone mounted a legal challenge, but eventually dropped it as it was unlikely to succeed. It was later revealed that the legal challenge had cost £4.2 million directly, as well as £36 million reimbursed to the bidders for costs incurred because of the six-month delay.

Three packages of 30-year franchises were drawn up, covering the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines (JNP), the Bakerloo, Central, Victoria and Waterloo and City lines (BCV) and the sub-surface lines, the Metropolitan, District, Circle, East London and Hammersmith &amp; City lines (SSL). During December 2002, JNP was won by Tube Lines while the BCV and SSL contracts were won by Metronet (a consortium of Balfour Beatty, WS Atkins, Bombardier, EDF Energy and Thames Water) in March 2003; these were known as the &quot;infracos&quot; (infrastructure companies). In 2003, overall control of the system passed to TfL, which had been opposed to the arrangement.

====Performance====
In March 2005, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, charged with ensuring value for money in public spending, published a report concluding that it was &quot;impossible to determine&quot; whether the PPP was better value than a publicly run investment programme, primarily because of the untested periodic review structure of the 30-year contracts. These were to be revised every 7.5 years, meaning that the ultimate price for the promised £15.7 billion of investment was still unknown. It noted that using public bond finance would have saved £90 million per year in financing costs, even though the Government guaranteed repayment of 95% of costs in the event of premature termination, and the contracts placed limits and exemptions on financial risk transferred to the infrastructure companies. The system still received an annual public subsidy of £1 billion, but its spending was being determined entirely by the infracos&#x27; interpretation of their 2,000-page PPP contracts. Although the private operators were expected to receive at least 18–20% returns on capital (for Metronet), for the type of risk associated with major upgrades, most of the work was low-risk maintenance and replacement. The public-sector procurement option (using private companies for specific major projects) would also have saved the £455 million cost of concluding the PPP contracts, not to mention the five years&#x27; delay the contract negotiations caused.

In April 2005, the Commissioner of Transport for London, Bob Kiley, pressed for an urgent review of the PPP, describing its performance as &quot;bordering on disaster&quot;. TfL also said that new technology promised by Metronet had yet to be seen — &quot;We were supposed to be getting private sector expertise and technology with the PPP (Public Private Partnership) but instead they are just using the same old kit.&quot; One week later, the chief executive of Metronet was sacked, after complaints that the company had made £50million profit despite being behind on all its major works. By April 2005, Metronet had started work on only 13 station refurbishments, instead of 32 as scheduled, and was more than a year behind on the refurbishment of 78 District line trains. It was also behind on its track replacement programme, having completed 28 km of the anticipated 48 km.

During March 2005, the House of Commons Transport Select Committee noted that &quot;Availability is the most important factor for Tube travellers. All the infracos needed to do to meet their availability benchmarks was to perform only a little worse than in the past. On most lines, they did not even manage that.&quot; During November 2006, Metronet were heavily criticised by the arbiter of the PPP, the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) over their performance from 2003 to 2006. Specific analysis included the finding that Metronet had not performed in an economic or efficient manner, and had failed to follow good industry practice. The ORR also stated that Metronet would be held responsible for £750million in cost overruns.

Metronet was also declared at fault by an accident investigators&#x27; report into a May 2004 derailment at White City, for failing to implement sufficient safety checks despite being ordered to do so by TfL. Three years later, Metronet admitted that it may have caused a Central Line train derailment near Mile End, in which a train hit a fire blanket left by maintenance workers.

====TfL takes over infracos====
Metronet, which used its shareholders as its main contractors, was unable to meet its targets and track replacement and station refurbishments fell behind schedule. In April 2007, Mayor Ken Livingstone stated that Metronet could collapse due to a £750million overspend. On 18 July 2007, the company went into administration; during May 2008, the company&#x27;s responsibilities were formally transferred back into public ownership under the authority of TfL.

The British government tried to find another private firm to fill the vacuum left by the liquidation of Metronet. However, only TfL expressed a viable interest in taking over Metronet&#x27;s responsibilities. The case for the PPP model was also weakened in 2008 when it was revealed that the demise of Metronet had cost the government £2bn. The five private companies that made up the Metronet alliance had to pay £70m each towards paying off the debts acquired by the consortium. However, due to a deal struck with the government in 2003, when the PPP scheme began operating, the companies were protected from any further liability, thus the British taxpayer therefore had to foot the rest of the bill. This outcome undermined the argument that PPP would place the risks involved in running the network into the hands of the private sector.

By early 2010, Tube Lines was behind schedule on the Jubilee line upgrade and after conflict arose over costs of future work in that year&#x27;s PPP review, Prior to this point, Tube Lines had reportedly brought in almost all of its projects both on time and on budget. On 7 May 2010, Transport for London agreed to buy out Bechtel and Amey (Ferrovial), the shareholders of Tube Lines, in exchange for £310million, formally ending the PPP. Combined with the takeover of Metronet, this meant that all maintenance was thereafter managed in-house, although TfL has continued to involve a large number of private suppliers and contractors.

Despite the collapse of the PPP, substantial investment to upgrade and modernise the Tube has taken place - with new trains (such as London Underground S7 and S8 Stock), new signalling, upgraded stations (such as King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras) and improved accessibility (such as at Green Park). 

===Recent history===
The Oyster card, a stored-value contactless smart card that can be used on Transport for London services instead of a ticket, first went on sale during 2003. The scheme was originally managed as a PPP by TranSys; TfL bought the rights to the Oyster card name in 2008.

On 7 July 2005, three bombs exploded on underground trains, two on the Circle line at Aldgate and Edgware Road and the third on the Piccadilly line between King&#x27;s Cross and Russell Square. Later that day, a bomb exploded on a bus in Woburn Place. Four suicide bombers had killed themselves and 52 other people, and it took over a month before underground services had been restored. 

In 2007, the East London line, operated as an isolated shuttle since 1939, closed so that it could be converted into a London Overground line. In December 2009 the Circle line changed from serving a closed loop around the centre of London on the north side of the River Thames to a spiral serving Hammersmith. 

On the Jubilee line a seventh car was added to all trains, in 2006 and a new signalling system allowing automatic operation was commissioned in 2011. On the Victoria line, new trains were introduced between July 2009 and June 2011, and a new signalling system has allowed 33 trains per hour from January 2013. The sub-surface (Metropolitan, District, Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City) lines have been upgraded, with new air-conditioned S Stock. Also, the sub-surface track, electrical supply and signalling systems are also being upgraded in a programme allowing an increased peak-hour capacity by the end of 2018. A single control room for the sub-surface network is to be established in Hammersmith and an automatic train control (ATC) system will replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s.

During the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Underground saw record ridership levels, with over 4.3 million people using the Tube on some days. This record was subsequently beaten in future years, with 4.82 million riders in December 2015. In 2013, the Underground celebrated its 150th anniversary, with celebratory events such as steam trains and installation of a unique Labyrinth artwork at each station.

In the 2010s, the Crossrail project was built at a cost of £18.8bn to connect two mainline railways with a new east west tunnel under central London, similar to Paris&#x27; Réseau Express Régional. Designed to increase rail capacity and reduce cross London journey times, the line opened as the Elizabeth line in May 2022. Although not part of the Underground, the line connects with many Underground stations, with the project rebuilding and expanding several central Underground stations including Tottenham Court Road.

Usage of the Underground was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic of the early 2020s. After growing concern that amongst the outbreak and despite government advice on social distancing, tube services were still crowded. All Night Overground and Night Tube services, as well as all services on the Waterloo &amp; City line, were suspended from 20 March, while 40 tube stations were closed on the same day. The Mayor of London and TfL urged people to use public transport only if absolutely essential, so that it could be used by critical workers. London Underground brought in new measures on 25 March to combat the spread of the virus by slowing the flow of passengers onto platforms, which included the imposition of queuing at ticket gates and turning off some escalators. Even with these measures in place there was still criticism that, especially in the rush hour, some stations and trains were experiencing crowding; however, statistics showed that the tube was experiencing some of the lowest passenger journey numbers since the 1800s.

The Northern Line Extension opened in September 2021, extending the Northern line from Kennington to Battersea Power Station via Nine Elms. The extension was privately funded, with contributions from developments across the Battersea Power Station, Vauxhall and Nine Elms areas.

==Goods traffic==

Goods trains ran over Metropolitan tracks from 1866 when the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and then the Midland Railways began a service to south of the Thames via Farringdon and Snow Hill tunnel. Goods depots were opened in the Farringdon area, accessed from the City Widened Lines. The GWR opened Smithfield Market Sidings in 1869, the GNR opened its depot in 1874, and the Midland during 1878. The Midland also negotiated running rights over the District Railway from the London &amp; South Western Railway at Hammersmith to South Kensington in 1876; two years later, it opened coal depots at Kensington High Street and West Kensington.

Goods traffic was to play an important part of Metropolitan traffic on the extension line out of Baker Street. During 1880, the Met started conveying coal from Finchley Road to Harrow. Goods and coal depots were provided at most of the stations on the extension line as they were built. Goods for London were initially handled at Willesden, with delivery by road or by transfer to the Midland. In 1909, the Met opened Vine Street goods depot near Farringdon with a regular service from West Hampstead. Coal for the steam locomotives, the company&#x27;s electric power station at Neasden and local gasworks were brought in via Quainton Road. Milk was delivered to the London suburbs and foodstuffs from Vine Street to Uxbridge. Fish to Billingsgate Market via the Met and the District joint station at Monument caused some complaints, leaving the station approaches in an &quot;indescribably filthy condition&quot;. The District suggested a separate entrance for the fish, but nothing was done. The traffic reduced significantly when road transport was introduced from to Marylebone, but the problem remained until 1936, being one reason the LPTB gave for abolishing the carrying of parcels on trains. The LPTB was also not interested in running the Metropolitan goods services. Vine Street goods station closed in 1936, and the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) took over all freight traffic from 1937.

When the Northern line was extended over the lines of the LNER to High Barnet and Mill Hill East in 1940, the stations retained their goods service. Starting at midnight trains would leave Highbury every five to ten minutes and access the line from Finsbury Park via Highgate High Level. The Central line stations also kept their goods service, worked from Temple Mills and accessed via Leytonstone, the Hainault loop stations being served via Woodford.

Goods services were gradually withdrawn during the 1950s and 1960s. The GNR goods depot on the City Widened Lines was closed in 1956 and Smithfield Market was last served by freight trains in 1962. Goods yards on the Uxbridge branch closed in 1964, and Northern line stations saw their last goods train in the same year. The closure of West Kensington yard the following year meant the withdrawal of goods trains from District and Piccadilly tracks. On the Central line, Hainault loop stations lost their goods service in 1965 and the rest of the line followed during the following year.

<text>Daniel David Dickau (born September 16, 1978) is an American former professional basketball player who currently works as an on-air broadcaster for ESPN, the Pac-12 Network, CBS Sports Network, Fox Sports and Westwood One. He is also a co-host of the &quot;Dickau and Slim Show&quot; on Spokane&#x27;s 700 ESPN with Sean &quot;Slim&quot; Widmer.

==Early life and college==
Born in Portland, Oregon, Dickau graduated from Prairie High School in nearby Brush Prairie, Washington. He enrolled at the University of Washington in Seattle in 1997 and played for the Huskies under head coach Bob Bender. Dickau fractured his heel 13 games into the 1998–99 season and announced his decision to transfer in April.

He enrolled at Gonzaga University in Spokane and sat out the 1999–2000 season as a transfer, a de facto redshirt year. He was a standout point guard for the Bulldogs for two seasons under head coach Mark Few, named a first team All-American his senior year in 2002.

== NBA career ==

=== Player ===
Dickau was selected in the first round of the 2002 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings, the 28th overall pick. He was traded eight times and wore various jersey numbers in his six-year NBA career:

*to the Atlanta Hawks (#12) on June 26, 2002 (on draft night for a first-round pick);
*to the Portland Trail Blazers (#7) on February 9, 2004 (Rasheed Wallace trade);
*to the Golden State Warriors (#10) on July 20, 2004 (Nick Van Exel trade);
*to the Dallas Mavericks (#21) on August 24, 2004 (Erick Dampier trade);
*to the New Orleans Hornets (#2) on December 3, 2004 (Darrell Armstrong trade);
*to the Boston Celtics (#20) on October 1, 2005 (New Orleans received a second-round draft pick);
*to the Portland Trail Blazers (for a second time, via a trade involving former teammate Theo Ratliff) (#2) on June 28, 2006, and
*to the New York Knicks (#1) on June 28, 2007 (Zach Randolph and Steve Francis trade).

For two years in a row, Dickau was traded in a draft-day trade package, first from the Celtics to the Trail Blazers, then from the Trail Blazers to the Knicks.

On June 28, 2006, the Celtics traded Dickau, center Raef LaFrentz and the 7th pick in the 2006 NBA draft to the Trail Blazers for center Theo Ratliff and guard Sebastian Telfair. Dickau was then sent to the Knicks along with Randolph, only to be waived when the Knicks acquired Jared Jordan. Two days later, Dickau signed with the Clippers.

<text>Milo Jay Aukerman (; born January 1, 1963) is an American singer, songwriter, and former research molecular biologist. Aukerman is most widely known for being the lead vocalist of the punk rock band the Descendents, a group widely considered to be pioneers of pop-punk. A caricature of Aukerman serves as the band&#x27;s mascot.

==Education and scientific career==
Aukerman attended Mira Costa High School, with fellow members of the Descendents. He holds a PhD degree in biology from UC San Diego, conducted postdoctoral research in molecular biology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the University of Pennsylvania, and formerly worked as a plant researcher at DuPont and as an adjunct professor at the University of Delaware. In a 2016 interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, Aukerman announced that he decided to quit researching in favor of doing music full-time.

==Musical career==
While not an original member, Aukerman joined Descendents after their first single was released (&quot;Ride the Wild&quot; b/w &quot;It&#x27;s a Hectic World&quot;), which featured founding members Frank Navetta and Tony Lombardo on lead vocals. Aukerman&#x27;s first recording with Descendents was the &quot;Fat&quot; EP, released in 1981. The first full-length Descendents album was released in 1982 and was titled &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot;, as Aukerman had by then decided to leave the group to pursue a degree in biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego. From 1983 to 1987 Aukerman would briefly rejoin Descendents several times to record albums and go on tour. Aukerman left the band for good at the conclusion of the supporting tour for the 1987 album &quot;All&quot;, after which the remaining members continued to tour and record with a series of lead singers under the name All.

Aukerman decided to rejoin Descendents in 1995, releasing the album &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; the following year. He returned to his molecular biology career following the tour supporting the album, returning to Descendents intermittently over the next several years to tour and to record the album &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; and the EP &quot;&#x27;Merican&quot;, both released in 2004 on Fat Wreck Chords.

In July 2016, Aukerman announced he would be leaving his scientific career to pursue the Descendents full-time, citing burnout with biochemistry and getting laid off from DuPont. The band released their seventh studio album, &quot;Hypercaffium Spazzinate&quot;, on July 29, 2016.

As a musician, Aukerman sings in a mid-range tenor, and his generally upbeat lyrics encompass such universal topics as girls/rejection, dependence upon caffeine, and the never-ending quest for good food. He is known for his bespectacled, unabashedly nerdy persona and self-deprecating, &quot;anti-rockstar&quot; demeanor. Apart from his work with Descendents, Aukerman has also provided backing vocals for other musicians (including Descendents offshoot All, and Black Flag on their 1985 album &quot;Loose Nut&quot;) and briefly fronted the band Milestone in 1988 in San Diego while attending university.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to tracking the lead vocals to Descendents&#x27; &quot;9th and Walnut&quot; at his home studio, Milo also contributed vocals remotely to Punk Rock Karaoke&#x27;s rendition of the Dickies&#x27; &quot;Manny, Moe and Jack&quot;, as well as covers of Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;Jealous Again&quot; (with bandmate Bill Stevenson playing lead guitar), Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;In Bloom&quot;, Devo&#x27;s &quot;Girl U Want&quot; and Green Day’s &quot;Basket Case&quot; for the YouTube series &quot;Mikey And His Uke&quot;.

==Personal life==
Aukerman was born on January 1, 1963, in Los Angeles, California. He has been married to Robin Andreasen since 1995 and is the father of two children, Owen and Claire Andreasen.

On July 27, 2023, Aukerman suffered a &quot;mild&quot; heart attack and underwent surgery.

<text>John Abraham Thorn (born April 17, 1947) is a German-born American sports historian, author, and publisher. Since 2011, he has served as the Official Baseball Historian for Major League Baseball.

==Early life==
Thorn was born in Stuttgart, Germany, in a displaced person&#x27;s camp to which his Polish Jewish parents had come as refugees. Less than two years after Thorn was born, his family emigrated to the United States, and initially settled in The Bronx, New York.

Of his love for baseball, Thorn said: &quot;I fell in love with [baseball] cards before I loved the game, when I discovered that baseball was something that all the kids on my street corner cared about... I was an immigrant kid and was looking for a way into America. With my background I saw myself as an underdog, and so Brooklyn had to be my team. I began watching the game seriously when I was eight, in 1955, on my Admiral television, but I had already begun to follow their exploits in the daily newspapers my father brought home with him each night.&quot;

As a teen, he played baseball and basketball at Richmond Hill High School. However, at age 19 he suffered a stroke. &quot;It was severe,&quot; he said, &quot;knocking out my left-side function for months as well as patches of personal memory — though not the powerful visual memory I retain for images and facts and statistics.&quot; The stroke left him with a limp and precluded his further participation in athletic activities.

Thorn attended Beloit College, from which he graduated in 1968.

==Writings==
Thorn is the author and editor of numerous books, including &quot;Total Baseball: The Official Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball&quot;, &quot;Total Football: The Official Encyclopedia of Major League Football&quot;, &quot;Treasures of the Baseball Hall of Fame&quot;, &quot;The Hidden Game of Baseball&quot;, &quot;The Glory Days: New York Baseball 1947–1957&quot;, and &quot;The Armchair Book of Baseball&quot;. His 2011 book, &quot;Baseball in the Garden of Eden: The Secret History of the Early Game&quot;, published by Simon &amp; Schuster, was an in-depth chronicle of the seminal development and pioneers of the sport. A &quot;New York Times&quot; review of the latter book referred to Thorn as &quot;a researcher of colossal diligence.&quot;

Thorn is also the co-author with Pete Palmer and Bob Carroll of &quot;The Hidden Game of Football&quot; and with them co-editors of &quot;Total Football&quot;. His book &quot;New York 400&quot;, a graphic history of the city timed for its quadricentennial, created with the Museum of the City of New York and Running Press, was published in September 2009. Thorn is a columnist for &quot;Voices&quot;, the publication of the New York Folklore Society.

He founded Total Sports Publishing and served as its publisher from 1998 to 2002.

==Role as historian==
Thorn served as the senior creative consultant for the 1994 Ken Burns documentary &quot;Baseball&quot;.

In 2004, Thorn discovered documentation tracing the origins of baseball in America to 1791 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He has also attempted to shed light on the contributions of 19th century pioneers of the game, while debunking common misconceptions. &quot;I don&#x27;t want anyone to think of me as a crusader on behalf of causes,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I&#x27;m only interested in setting the story straight, and in recognizing other stories for what they are, some of which are legend.&quot; Despite the claims of various localities to being the &quot;birthplace of baseball,&quot; Thorn simply follows facts. &quot;Abner Doubleday, Santa Claus, and Dracula,&quot; he notes, &quot;are equally mythic figures.&quot;

In June 2006, the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) bestowed on Thorn its highest accolade, the Bob Davids Award. The award honors those whose contributions to SABR and baseball reflect the ingenuity, integrity, and self-sacrifice of the late founder and past president of SABR, L. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Davids.

On March 1, 2011, John Thorn was named Official Baseball Historian for Major League Baseball, succeeding the late &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; baseball writer Jerome Holtzman, who served in the role from 1999 until his death in 2008.

Thorn played an important role in the retroactive recategorization of the defunct Negro leagues, which existed during the segregation of baseball, as major leagues. On May 28, 2024, Major League Baseball said that statistics from the Negro Leagues will officially become part of the MLB&#x27;s historical record.

==Personal life==
Thorn has three sons from two previous marriages. He is currently married to Erica Freudenberger, former director of the Red Hook Public Library in Red Hook, New York, and who is currently affiliated with the Southern Adirondack Library System.

He and his wife live in Catskill, New York where they moved in 2010. He claims to have been drawn to the town because of its &quot;slow pace,&quot; which suits him because, as Thorn asserts, &quot;I pride myself on being the world&#x27;s most boring man.&quot;

Thorn&#x27;s great-grandfather was magician Ernest Thorn; the two share their middle name &quot;Abraham&quot;.

<text>Joseph Albert Wapner (November 15, 1919 – February 26, 2017) was an American judge and television personality. He is best known as the first presiding judge of the reality court show &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;. The show&#x27;s first run in syndication, with Judge Wapner presiding as judge, continued from 1981 to 1993, for 12 seasons and 2,484 episodes. Although the show&#x27;s second run was presided over by multiple judges, Wapner was the sole judge to preside during the show&#x27;s first incarnation. His tenure on the program made him the first jurist of arbitration-based reality court shows, which evolved into the most popular trend in the judicial genre and continues to be to the present.

==Early life==
Joseph Albert Wapner was born on November 15, 1919, in Los Angeles, California, to Jewish parents who had immigrated there; his father, attorney Joseph Max Wapner (1898–1992), was from Romania, while his mother, Fannie (&quot;née&quot; Friedman) (1901-1990), was from Russia. Wapner had a younger sister named Irene. Wapner attended Hollywood High School and once dated actress Lana Turner while in high school.

Wapner was a graduate of the University of Southern California (1941) and the USC Law School (1948), serving in World War II in between. Wapner was awarded the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star while serving in the South Pacific in Cebu. He was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army as a lieutenant. While at U.S.C. Wapner was initiated into the Tau Gamma chapter of the Tau Epsilon Phi fraternity.

==Career==
===Legal career===
Wapner was an attorney in private practice for ten years.

Appointed by Governor Pat Brown to the Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1959, Wapner served two years before being elevated to the Los Angeles County Superior Court, where he served for 18 years before retiring. While serving on the Superior Court bench, Wapner served as presiding judge in 1969 and 1970. Wapner was also president of the California Judges Association in 1975 and 1976 and retired from the court on November 16, 1979.

===&quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;===

Wapner was the first judge to preside over the court show &quot;The People&#x27;s Court.&quot; His tenure on the program lasted from 1981 to 1993, making for 2,340 half-hour episodes. On the series, he conducted a binding arbitration that was set up to resemble a small claims court by pitting parties, without lawyers, against each other. The legacy of the show&#x27;s high popularity has led to various other similar syndicated courtroom shows, such as &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and &quot;Hot Bench&quot;, among others.

After 12 seasons on &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;, Wapner was not invited back to the series in 1993, when the ratings had dropped to an all-time low. After a four-year hiatus, beginning in 1993, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; returned to the air in 1997, and aired until July 2023. Ed Koch, former mayor of New York City, served as judge from September 1997 until June 1999, Jerry Sheindlin served from September 1999 until March 2001, and Marilyn Milian served from March 2001 until July 2023.

Wapner stated that he was told years later that the producers did not want to hurt his feelings; however, he noted that this is precisely what the show did. Wapner also said he was not notified when the producers revamped the series. He declined to offer opinions on the &quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot; judges who succeeded him, as he never watched the revamped program.

On November 12, 2009, Wapner received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He and Judith Sheindlin of the television court show &quot;Judge Judy&quot; were the only two television jurists who have received the honor as of 2009. Wapner was publicly critical of Sheindlin&#x27;s courtroom adjudicating approach.

On November 13, 2009, in honor of his 90th birthday on November 15, Wapner made a one-time-only return to the court show, acting as a guest judge, presiding over a case in the Marilyn Milian era of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;.

Until the summer of 2013, Wapner also held the title of longest-reigning arbiter over &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;. However, by completion of the court show&#x27;s 2012–2013 season, Milian captured this title from him and became the longest-reigning judge in the series. Milian remained on the show until its cancellation in July 2023.

=== Other media appearances and endeavors ===
Five years after presiding over &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;, Wapner returned to television as a judge in spin-off nontraditional courtroom series &quot;Judge Wapner&#x27;s Animal Court&quot;, lasting for two seasons (1998–1999 and 1999–2000) on Animal Planet.

Wapner authored a book, &quot;A View from the Bench&quot; (1987, Simon and Schuster, ).

On the back cover, Alice Cooper&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;DaDa&quot; has &quot;Special Thanks to Judge Joseph A. Wapner&quot;.

On June 27, 1986, Wapner appeared on the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; to hear a case of David Letterman vs. Johnny Carson over alleged damage to the headlight of Letterman&#x27;s pickup truck when Carson had the truck towed to the studio. Wapner ruled in favor of Letterman, granting him $24.95.

In 1995 he appeared as an alternate-universe version of himself as Commissar of a &quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot; in a Soviet-controlled California in an early episode of &quot;Sliders&quot;.

===Endorsements===
During 1999–2000, Wapner served as the national spokesperson for Singer Asset Finance Company, LLC, a specialty finance company, appearing in national television commercials and print ads.

Since around 2010, the soda company Rocket Fizz has marketed a beverage, Judge Wapner Cream Soda, featuring the slogan, &quot;I sentence you to drink my cream soda.&quot;

== Personal life, final years and death==
Wapner was active in Jewish causes, including sitting on the board of a Jewish school. He was married to Mildred “Mickey” Wapner (née Nebenzahl) for 71 years, from 1946 until his death in 2017. Their daughter Sarah died from heart disease in May 2015 at age 56. They also had two sons who became attorneys: David Miron-Wapner and Frederick Nathan Wapner, the latter of whom was a prosecutor and L.A. district attorney who also became a judge (including with the Los Angeles County Superior Court). Wapner also had four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

Wapner died from respiratory failure on February 26, 2017, at his home in Los Angeles. He was 97 years old. He is interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

<text>The Beaverdale neighborhood is one of the largest of the 51 recognized neighborhood associations in the city of Des Moines, Iowa, in the United States. It extends from Forest Avenue at its southernmost border to the city limits at its northern border.

Once considered the rural, western edge of nineteenth century Des Moines, what is now Beaverdale consisted of large land tracts devoted to fruit orchards and truck farms. Early traffic crossed the area on an unpaved stagecoach highway known, since before the Civil War, as the Fort Dodge Stage Road. The road was renamed Beaver Avenue in 1903 and was later improved in 1917 with brick paving. The entire northwest section of Des Moines was commonly known as &quot;Urbandale&quot; until 1917, when the name was formally adopted by an adjacent suburban village. Soon afterwards, city residents from the area met and selected &quot;Beaverdale&quot; as the name to identify their neighborhood.

Most of the subdivisions were developed in the period between 1920 and 1940, when cars were becoming an essential part of every household. A major phase of construction occurred after the economic depression of the 1930s. Federal mortgage financing was created to encourage home buying. The local developers followed a variety of traditional home designs and they incorporated the latest trends in electrical conveniences into their plans. It was during this time, in 1938, that the fashionable &quot;Beaverdale Brick&quot; homes, built by local contractor E.T. McMurray, appeared. For the most part, the subdivisions were laid out in basic grid patterns, a convenient standard throughout Midwestern urban development. Two exceptions, Maryland Park and Ashby Manor, are notable for their winding drives and their early attention to design elements that create distinctive and attractive home settings.

In 2017, the neighborhood celebrated its centennial, marking 100 years of existence. A 116-foot-long Beaverdale mural was painted on the north wall of Uptempo Music, 2714 Beaver Ave.

==Areas of interest==
Beaverdale is 10 minutes from downtown Des Moines, five minutes from Drake University and Varsity Theater, five minutes from Merle Hay Mall, and 10 minutes from Valley West Mall. The Beaverdale Neighborhood Association hosts many events throughout the year. The neighborhood hosts an Easter egg hunt in the spring, a music festival each summer, and a holiday lights contest in the winter. The Beaverdale Fall Festival parade occurs on the third weekend in September.

Most of the students who live in this area typically attend either Hoover High School or Roosevelt High School.

==Parks and recreation==
The Beaverdale neighborhood contains over of public parkland that offers a variety of recreational activities.

<doc id="1243966" wikidata="Q9023650" url="?curid=1243966" title="Longwood station (MBTA)">
<text>Longwood station is a light rail station on the MBTA Green Line D branch, located on Chapel Street in Brookline, Massachusetts, on the border with Boston, just north of Longwood Avenue. It serves the Longwood Medical Area, the Colleges of the Fenway, and residential areas of Brookline. The station opened with the rest of the line on July 4, 1959. After renovation work completed in 2009, Longwood station is accessible from both Chapel Street and Riverway Park.

==History==

===Original stations===

The Boston and Worcester Railroad opened a branch from Brookline Junction to Brookline on April 10, 1848. There was one intermediate station on the branch – Longwood just south of Longwood Avenue. The Charles River Branch Railroad extended the Brookline branch to Newton Upper Falls in November 1852 and to Needham in June 1853, keeping the original B&amp;W station for its service.

The Sears Chapel was built in 1861 and the Church of Our Savior in 1868; sometime that decade Chapel station was opened as a flag stop located at Carlton Street. The Boston and Albany Railroad bought back the line, then part of the New York and New England Railroad, in February 1883. It was double-tracked and extended to the B&amp;A main at Riverside; &quot;Newton Circuit&quot; service via the Highland branch and the main line began on May 16, 1886.

===Station consolidation===

As part of a general improvement program, the railroad replaced many of its original wooden stations with new stone buildings designed by H.H. Richardson and Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge and landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted. All stations on the Highland branch save for Longwood, Chapel, and Brookline were thus rebuilt between 1883 and 1894.

In April 1892, the B&amp;A petitioned the Massachusetts Board of Railroad Commissioners to allow them to combine the two old stations into a single new station between their location. The railroad cited the closeness of the two stations, their poor locations, and traffic losses due to the electrified trolley line opened on nearby Beacon Street in 1889. The board referenced the railroad&#x27;s arguments, the assent of the Brookline selectmen, and an overwhelming majority of residents and passengers in favor of the consolidation when giving their assent.

In early 1893, the B&amp;A commissioned Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge to build new stations at Longwood and Riverside. The new Longwood station was a &quot;very simple rectangular design&quot; with a dominant stone roof that provided shelter on all four sides. Located on Chapel Street near Hawes Street between the former station locations, it was constructed from July 1893 to May 1894.

A footbridge at Carlton Street was added by the town in mid-1894 to provide access to the Riverway Park. One of the only steel bridges in an Olmsted-designed park, it was designed and built by Alexis French, Brookline&#x27;s first town engineer. The bridge was closed around 1975 due to severe corrosion. Plans to repair and reopen the footbridge proved locally controversial for several decades. The bridge deck was removed in July 2021 for restoration and returned in October 2022. The footbridge reopened in August 2023.

===Conversion to light rail service===

The station agent was removed in May 1949, but the station building remained in use as shelter for passengers. In June 1957, the Massachusetts Legislature approved the purchase of the branch by the M.T.A. from the nearly-bankrupt New York Central Railroad for conversion to a trolley line. Service ended on May 31, 1958. The line was quickly converted for trolley service, and the line including Longwood station reopened on July 4, 1959. The 1893-built station was torn down during the conversion to make room for a small parking lot. The station has two side platforms serving the line&#x27;s two tracks.

===Renovations===
During the Brookline Village/Longwood Avenue Station Renovation Project, the MBTA reconstructed Longwood and stations for accessibility. The two stations received raised platforms to interface with low-floor LRVs, wooden ramps to access older high-floor LRVs, and other upgrades. The MBTA originally planned to have the Chapel Street entrance be the only accessible entrance to Longwood station but after it became apparent this was not sufficient, ramps were added from Riverway Park as well. Work on both stations began on July 23, 2007, and construction was completed in the second quarter of 2009.

<doc id="1243977" wikidata="Q2142954" url="?curid=1243977" title="Eternal sin">
<text>In Christian hamartiology, eternal sin, the unforgivable sin, unpardon sin, or ultimate sin is the sin which will not be forgiven by God. One eternal or unforgivable sin (blasphemy against the Holy Spirit), also known as the sin unto death, is specified in several passages of the Synoptic Gospels, including Mark 3:28–29, Matthew 12:31–32, and Luke 12:10, as well as other New Testament passages including Hebrews 6:4–6, Hebrews 10:26–31, and 1 John 5:16.

The unforgivable sin is interpreted by Christian theologians in various ways, although they generally agree that one who has committed the sin is no longer able to repent, and so one who is fearful that they have committed it has not done so.

==New Testament passages==
Several passages in the New Testament are frequently interpreted as referring to the unforgivable sin:
* Matthew 12:30–32: &quot;Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. Therefore I tell you, people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.&quot;
* Mark 3:28–30: &quot;Truly I tell you, people will be forgiven for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never have forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin—for they had said, &quot;He has an unclean spirit.&quot;&quot;
* Luke 12:8–10: &quot;And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God; but whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of God. And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.&quot;
* Hebrews 6:4–6: &quot;For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, since on their own they are crucifying again the Son of God and are holding him up to contempt.&quot;
* Hebrews 10:26–31: &quot;For if we willfully persist in sin after having received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries. Anyone who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy &quot;on the testimony of two or three witnesses.&quot; How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have spurned the Son of God, profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace? For we know the one who said, &quot;Vengeance is mine, I will repay.&quot; And again, &quot;The Lord will judge his people.&quot; It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&quot;
* 1 John 5:16: &quot;If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.&quot;

==Teaching by Christian denomination==

===Arminianism===

The teaching of Jacob Arminius defined the unforgivable sin as &quot;the rejection and refusing of Jesus Christ through determined malice and hatred against Christ&quot;. However, Arminius differed with Calvin in believing that sin could be committed by believers, a conclusion he reached through his interpretation of Hebrews 6:4–6.

John Wesley, the father of the Methodist tradition, discussed the unforgivable sin in a sermon titled &quot;A Call to Backsliders&quot;, in which he wrote that &quot;this blasphemy is absolutely unpardonable; and that, consequently, for those who have been guilty of this, God &#x27;will be no more entreated&#x27;.&quot; A prominent Methodist catechism, &quot;A Catechism on the Christian Religion: The Doctrines of Christianity with Special Emphasis on Wesleyan Concepts&quot; states:

This Wesleyan–Arminian interpretation of the unforgivable sin includes the deliberate labeling of good as evil, as rejecting the conviction of the Holy Spirit, of publicly attributing the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan, and attributing the work of Jesus to Satan. The United Methodist Church, a Methodist connexion, thus teaches:

===Mormonism===

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also nicknamed Mormons, have a similar understanding of eternal sin. Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, said in the King Follett discourse:

Church apostle and later President of the Church, Spencer W. Kimball, stated that &quot;the sin against the Holy Ghost requires such knowledge that it is manifestly impossible for the rank and file [of the church] to commit such a sin&quot;.

===Reformed===
John Calvin, the founder of the Reformed tradition of Christianity (which includes the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Reformed Anglican denominations) wrote:

===Catholicism===

The Church Fathers considered additional interpretations other than it being to attribute the Holy Spirit&#x27;s works to Satan with Augustine of Hippo calling it one of the more difficult passages of Scripture. Thomas Aquinas summarized the Church Fathers&#x27; treatments and proposed three possible explanations:
# That an insult directed against any of the Three Divine Persons may be considered a sin against the Holy Spirit; and/or;
# That persisting in mortal sin till death, with final impenitence, as Augustine proposed, frustrates the work of the Holy Spirit, to whom is appropriated the remission of sins; and/or;
# That sins against the quality of the Third Divine Person, being charity and goodness, are conducted in malice, in that they resist the inspirations of the Holy Spirit to turn away from or be delivered from evil. Such sin may be considered graver than those committed against the Father through frailty, and those committed against the Son through ignorance.

In the context of the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, blasphemy against the Spirit is the sin of attributing to Satan what is the work of the Spirit of God, such as when the Pharisees earlier accused Jesus of driving out demons only by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons. The Catholic Encyclopedia cites Matthew 12:22–32; Mark 3:22–30; Luke 12:10 (cf. 11:14–23) and gives one definition of &quot;the unforgivable sin&quot;—or sin against the Holy Ghost—as ″to sin against the Holy Ghost is to confound Him with the spirit of evil, it is to deny, from pure malice, the Divine character of works manifestly Divine.″ The article further states that &quot;sin against the Son of Man&quot; may be forgiven because it is committed against the human person of Christ, which veils the Divine with a &quot;humble and lowly appearance,&quot; and therefore such sin is excusable because it is committed through &quot;man&#x27;s ignorance and misunderstanding.&quot;

According to the Catechism of the Council of Trent, referencing Ambrose&#x27;s &quot;Concerning Repentance&quot;, the Church believes there is no offence, however serious, that cannot be taken away by Baptism, or absolved from in the Confessional—that no one, however wicked and guilty, may not confidently hope for forgiveness.

Thomas Aquinas lists, or responds to, six sins that go against the Holy Spirit:
* Despair: which consists in thinking that one&#x27;s own malice is greater than Divine Goodness, as the Master of the Sentences teaches,
* Presumption: if a person wants to obtain glory without merits or pardon without repentance
* Resistance to the known truth
* Envy of a brother&#x27;s spiritual good, i.e., of the increase of Divine grace in the world
* Impenitence, i.e., the specific purpose of not repenting a sin
* Obstinacy, &quot;whereby a person hardens his purpose by clinging to sin&quot;.

Thomas Aquinas explains that the unforgivability of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit means that it removes the entrance to these means of salvation; however, it cannot hinder God in taking away this obstacle by way of a miracle.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that, while no sin is absolutely &quot;unforgivable&quot;, some sins represent a deliberate refusal to repent and accept the infinite mercy of God; a person committing such a sin refuses God&#x27;s forgiveness, which can lead to self-condemnation to Hell. In other words, one damns oneself by final impenitence (refusal to repent), as taught by John Paul II:

The Catechism says that Christ desires &quot;the gates of forgiveness should always be open to anyone who turns away from sin.&quot; As did St Augustine, the Catholic Church today teaches that only dying unrepentant for one&#x27;s sins is the only unforgivable sin. In , Pope John Paul II writes &quot;According to such an exegesis, &#x27;blasphemy&#x27; does not properly consist in offending against the Holy Spirit in words; it consists rather in the refusal to accept the salvation which God offers to man through the Holy Spirit, working through the power of the Cross&quot;, and &quot;If Jesus says that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven either in this life or in the next, it is because this &quot;non-forgiveness&quot; is linked, as to its cause, to &quot;non-repentance,&quot; in other words to the radical refusal to be converted. This means the refusal to come to the sources of Redemption, which nevertheless remain &quot;always&quot; open in the economy of salvation in which the mission of the Holy Spirit is accomplished.&quot;

===Russian Orthodox Church===
The importance of prayer (1 Thessalonians 5:17: &quot;pray without ceasing&quot;) and humility (Jesus Prayer: &quot;Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner&quot;) in Christianity is reflected by an Orthodox catechism as follows:
===Southern Baptists===
According to Southern Baptist pastor Billy Graham, continuing to reject Jesus is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.

==In Judaism==

A very similar, although not identical, parallel to Matthew 12:31–32 can be found in the Avot of Rabbi Natan:
However, Talmudic sources in several places qualify the above and similar statements and explain it to mean only that repentance is made more difficult because of the severity of such a sin. The Talmud&#x27;s golden rule is that the gates of repentance are never, ever closed and, to quote Maimonides, &quot;even if one is a heretic his whole life and repents on his dying day, his penitence is accepted.&quot;

==In Islam==
In the Quran, is an unpardonable sin:

One who persists in shirk without repenting at death is doomed to eternal damnation in Jahannam. includes polytheism, such as believing Jesus is God or taking rabbis as one&#x27;s lords in derogation to God.()

<text>Longwood Medical Area station is a light rail stop on the MBTA Green Line E branch, located in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. It is named for the adjacent Longwood Medical Area.

==History==

Until the completion of the Huntington Avenue subway from to a portal near Opera Place on February 16, 1941, streetcars ran on the surface from the Boylston Street portal. Like other surface stops on the median-reservation section of the line, Longwood Avenue station had bare asphalt platforms. In 1972, the MBTA began planning a reconstruction of that section of the line, then scheduled for 1973-74. The work was eventually done in 1980, when the line was closed to modify the track and wires for the new LRVs. The line was cut back to Symphony on March 21, 1980; it was re-extended to Northeastern (using LRVs) on June 21 and Brigham Circle on September 20.

The station was renamed from Longwood–Hospitals to Longwood Medical Area in the 1980s. Longwood Medical Area&#x27;s 3,813 daily boardings make it the busiest surface stop on the Green Line. In the early 2000s, the MBTA modified key surface stops with raised platforms for accessibility as part of the Light Rail Accessibility Program. The renovation of Longwood Medical Area - part of a $32 million modification of thirteen B, C, and E branch stations - was completed on January 13, 2003.

<text>Brigham Circle station is a station on the light rail MBTA Green Line &quot;E&quot; branch, located just east of Brigham Circle in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. With raised platforms installed in a 2001-03 renovation, the station is accessible when served by low-floor streetcars.

The two side platforms are staggered, with the outbound platform further west. Crosswalks across Huntington Avenue to the station are present at Brigham Circle (to the outbound platform), between the two platforms, and at Wigglesworth Street (to the inbound platform). East of Brigham Circle, the E branch runs in a dedicated reservation in the median of Huntington Avenue; west of the circle is street running in mixed traffic to the terminus at Heath Street. Because of this, service is often terminated at Brigham Circle due to traffic conditions to preserve service frequency on the remainder of the line. At these times, the parallel bus provides all service west of Brigham Circle. A facing point crossover is located just east of the station, allowing terminating trains to cross over to the inbound platform.

==History==

Like other surface stops on the median-reservation section of the line, Brigham Circle (Francis Street) station had bare asphalt platforms. In 1972, the MBTA began planning a reconstruction of that section of the line, then scheduled for 1973-74. Three lightly used stops, including one at Wigglesworth Street, were to be closed. The work (minus the footbridge) were eventually done in 1980, when the line was closed to modify the track and wires for the new LRVs. The line was cut back to Symphony on March 21, 1980; it was re-extended to Northeastern (using LRVs) on June 21 and Brigham Circle on September 20. The inbound platform was moved east, with its east end at Wigglesworth Street.

In the early 2000s, the MBTA modified key surface stops with raised platforms for accessibility as part of the Light Rail Accessibility Program. The renovation of Brigham Circle - part of a $32 million modification of thirteen B, C, and E branch stations - was completed in 2003.

As part of a series of service reductions due to a budget crisis, on July 1, 2012 the MBTA began terminating weekend service at Brigham Circle. The cutback was unpopular with local residents, who considered it an unnecessary inconvenience. On October 13, 2012, the cut was quietly reversed by reducing frequency on the branch slightly, thus allowing the same equipment to cover the full line at no additional cost. This was made official with the December 29, 2012 timetable.

<text>The College of Engineering, formerly the Dwight Look College of Engineering, is the engineering school of Texas A&amp;M University in College Station and is home to over 22,000 students in 15 departments.

Prior to 2016, the college was known as the Dwight Look College of Engineering. The college was named after the civil engineering graduate, Harold Dwight Look, an army veteran of World War II who later founded a construction company on the U.S. Territory of Guam, where he lived for 40 years until his death on September 5, 2002, at the age of 80.

In 1992, Look donated 1,146 acres in Guam valued at $52 million to the university. It was the largest single gift ever received by the university, which later named the engineering college after Look. It was reported that Texas A&amp;M was looking to sell the property in 2009.

==History==
The first engineering department at Texas A&amp;M appeared in 1880, four years after the foundation of the school, with the creation of the Department of Engineering, Mechanics, and Drawing. For the next several years, the curriculum focused on practical training to assist students in finding industrial and vocational work. By 1887, separate departments had been created for mechanical engineering and for civil engineering and drawing.

To assist the United States during World War I, the Department of Mechanical Engineering shifted focus to train blacksmiths, automobile mechanics, machinists, draftsmen, general mechanics, and pipe fitters for the war. Following the war, the department&#x27;s enrollment continued to increase, and it began offering courses in power, industrial and railway, or transportation engineering. In the 1930s, these options were eliminated, while others, including aerodynamics, air-conditioning and physical metallurgy began to be offered. During the 1936–1937 school year, the Department of Mechanical Engineering was first accredited by the Engineering Council for Professional Development, now known as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.

By 1940, the engineering school comprised almost half of Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s enrollment. As World War II dawned, the school again assisted the war effort, with the Department of Mechanical Engineering faculty volunteering to teach at military bases throughout the state. Following the war, college introduced a Ph.D. program, and industries and government began to sponsor research within the college.

<text>, also called , &quot;Nomijima&quot;, &quot;Nomi Island&quot;, or is an island in Hiroshima Bay located in southwestern Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. The mess with island name originates from the ancient (and possibly legendary) strait at now town .

==Geography==
The island is roughly Y-shaped, with the former Nōmi occupying center, the Okimi - north-western branch, Edashima - north-eastern branch, and Ōgaki - the southern branch. The island&#x27;s highest peak, mount high, is located on the western edge of Nōmi town.

==Transportation==
Since 1973, the island is connected to the Japanese mainland of Honshu by the bridge passing through the Kurahashi-jima island. The island is served by the national route 487. Also, ferries are available from the cities of Hiroshima and Kure on Honshu island and Matsuyama on Shikoku island.

==History==
The Imperial Japanese Naval Academy was moved to &quot;Edashima Island&quot; in 1888. While the academy still exists under the name Naval Academy Edashima, modern Edashima focuses on olive cultivation and fish hatcheries in Edashima Bay north of the island.

<text>Ross Thomas (February 19, 1926, in Oklahoma City – December 18, 1995, in Santa Monica, California) was an American writer of crime fiction. He is best known for his witty thrillers that expose the mechanisms of professional politics. He also wrote five novels under the pseudonym Oliver Bleeck about professional go-between Philip St. Ives.

==Early life==
Thomas served with the infantry in the Philippines during World War II. He worked as a public relations specialist, correspondent with the Armed Forces Network, union spokesman, and political strategist in the USA, Bonn (Germany), and Nigeria before becoming a writer.

==Career==
Thomas&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;The Cold War Swap&quot;, introducing McCorkle and Padillo, was written in only six weeks and won a 1967 Edgar Award for Best First Novel. &quot;Briarpatch&quot; earned the 1985 Edgar for Best Novel. In 2002 he was honored with the inaugural Gumshoe Lifetime Achievement Award, one of only two authors to earn the award posthumously (the other was &quot;87th Precinct&quot; author Ed McBain in 2006).

In addition to his novels, Thomas also wrote an original screenplay for the 1995 movie &quot;Bad Company&quot;, about a CIA affiliated private spy organization. It was produced by Disney&#x27;s Touchstone Pictures, scored by Joel and Ethan Coen&#x27;s regular composer Carter Burwell and starred Ellen Barkin and Laurence Fishburne.

Thomas wrote an unproduced film for producer Robert Evans entitled &quot;Jimmy the Rumour&quot;. The project is the story of a man born without an identity who works as a thief stealing from other thieves.

The first three novels in the McCorkle-Padillo series are written in the first person, as are a number of others through &quot;Yellow Dog Contract&quot;. The fourth and final McCorkle-Padillo novel has an omniscient narrator, as do all of the other novels published after 1976. All five of the Philip St. Ives stories, however, are told in the first person.

==Death==
Thomas died of lung cancer in Santa Monica, California, at age 69.

<doc id="1244011" wikidata="Q541372" url="?curid=1244011" title="Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930">
<text>The Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 was a treaty of alliance between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the British-Mandate-controlled administration of the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq. The treaty was between the governments of George V the United Kingdom and Faisal I of Iraq. High Commissioner Francis Humphrys signed for the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Nuri as-Said signed for Iraq. The 1930 treaty was based upon an earlier Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922 but took into account Iraq&#x27;s increased importance to British interests given new oil finds made in 1927.

==Background==
During the Mesopotamian campaign of the First World War, the British Army (alongside troops from the Commonwealth), fighting on the side of Allies, defeated the forces of the Ottoman Empire, fighting on the side the Central Powers. After the end of the First World War, British troops remained in the region which became the Kingdom of Iraq. In 1920, after the Ottoman Empire was partitioned, the United Kingdom formally established control over what was to become Iraq under a mandate from the League of Nations.

The Kingdom of Iraq began with the coronation of King Faisal I on 23 August 1921. The 1930 treaty provided a path towards nominal independence for Iraq two years later at the termination of the mandate and upon the entry of Iraq itself as a member of the League of Nations. The main purpose of the treaty was to give the British a variety of commercial and military rights within the country after independence.

==Provisions and effect==

British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was to write that the 1930 treaty provided that the British could maintain air bases near Basra and Habbaniya &quot;in times of peace&quot; and have the right of transit for military forces and supplies &quot;at all times&quot;. In addition, Churchill indicated that the treaty would provide &quot;all possible facilities&quot; including the use of railways, rivers, ports, and airways for the passage of armed forces &quot;during times of war&quot;.

The terms of the treaty were used to justify a British invasion and the occupation of Iraq after a nationalist coup whose leaders had contacts among the Axis powers.

The British used the terms of the treaty as a basis for a military occupation that lasted until end of 1947. As they prepared to depart Iraq, an attempt was made to get the Iraqi government to sign a new military treaty giving the British greater powers than under the 1930 treaty. While that treaty was approved, it never came into effect because of unrest and large demonstrations in Iraq against it (the Al-Wathbah uprising).

<text>James W. Robinson, Jr. Secondary School, commonly known as Robinson Secondary School, is a six-year public school in the Fairfax, Virginia, a Northern Virginia suburb southwest of Washington, D.C.

Opened in 1971, Robinson is located south of Braddock Road near George Mason University, and is administered by the Fairfax County Public Schools. It offers the International Baccalaureate program, and has approximately 3,900 students in grades 7–12. Robinson&#x27;s school colors are royal blue and gold, and the school mascot is a ram.

==History==

Robinson was named after Medal of Honor recipient James W. Robinson, Jr., the first resident of Virginia to be awarded the medal during the Vietnam War. Sergeant Robinson, age 25, was fatally wounded under heroic circumstances in South Vietnam in April 1966, while serving in the infantry in the U.S. Army. 
The school opened its doors in September 1971, taking its students from Fairfax, W.T. Woodson, Oakton, and West Springfield high schools. It was the second of Fairfax County&#x27;s &quot;secondary schools,&quot; or &quot;superschools,&quot; which housed grades 7–12. Lake Braddock, which opened two years later in 1973, was the third of these schools from this era. The first was Hayfield, near Mount Vernon, which opened in 1968, and the most recent is South County in Lorton, which opened in 2005, taking its students from former Hayfield territory. South County has since reverted to high school status with the opening of South County Middle School near the school&#x27;s athletic gym.

==Awards and recognitions==

Robinson won the 2018–19 Wells Fargo Cup race, which is presented annually to Virginia public high schools that have &quot;demonstrated extraordinary success in academic activities throughout the year&quot;. This is the first time Robinson has won the Wells Fargo Cup for Academics.

==Demographics==
For the 2018–19 school year, Robinson&#x27;s grade 9–12 student body was 59.05% White, 13.69% Asian, 14.66% Hispanic, 5.89% Black and 6.71% other races. The grade 7–8 student body was 57.46% White, 13.27% Asian, 14.92% Hispanic, 6.68% Black and 7.67% other races.

== Music Department ==
Robinson Secondary School has earned a reputation for musical excellence, with its ensembles frequently achieving superior ratings at state and national competitions.

=== Ensembles and Offerings ===
The program includes a variety of ensembles, catering to students with diverse musical interests and skill levels:

* Bands – The school boasts several concert bands, including Symphonic Band, Concert Band, as well as an award-winning marching band known as the &quot;Robinson Marching Rams&quot;.

Robinson has been recognized as a &quot;Thirty Year Virginia Honor Band&quot;, earning a membership in the VBODA Hall of Fame. The Robinson Symphonic Band has appeared at five VMEA state conferences, one ASBDA convention, four National Concert Band Festivals and the Midwest Band and Orchestra Clinic. Many students earn placements in District, Regional, and All-State Honor Ensembles. Robinson also attended the 79th annual Midwest Clinic.

==LSD scandal==
In 1991, Robinson was the center of an LSD trafficking scandal in which a drug ring sold more than 100,000 doses of LSD over two years. The ring was exposed when a 16-year-old Robinson student shot and wounded a Fairfax police officer. In the course of the investigation it was revealed that six Robinson and Lake Braddock graduates were receiving large quantities of the drug through the mail. One of the men who was facing the harshest penalties faked suicide and fled the area, only to be caught two years later in St. Louis and sentenced to 24 years in prison with no possibility of parole.

<text>Michael Lockett Garrett (born April 12, 1944) is an American former football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) and the American Football League (AFL) for eight seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Diego Chargers. He played college football for the USC Trojans, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1965.

From 1993 until 2010 he served as the athletic director at the University of Southern California (USC). Then, he became the athletic director at California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA) in 2015.

==Early life==
Garrett was born on April 12, 1944, in Los Angeles, California, the fourth of six children. He was a resident of the Maravilla housing projects. Garrett graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School in Los Angeles, where he played defensive back and running back on the school&#x27;s football team. As a senior, he rushed for 1,467 yards and scored 153 points. In 1961, he was named Los Angeles City Player of the Year.

==College career==
Garrett had wanted to play college football at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), but the relationship did not work out. Instead, he attended the University of Southern California (USC), where coach John McKay was creating an offense featuring the tailback.

A two time All-American (including a unanimous selection in 1965), Garrett set numerous NCAA, Pac-8 Conference and USC records in his career by amassing a then unheard of 3,221 yards, while scoring 30 touchdowns. Garrett also led the nation in rushing in 1965 with 267 carries for 1,440 yards. He also caught 36 passes, returned 43 punts (two for touchdowns of 87 and 74 yards), returned 30 kickoffs and threw 6 passes. Two of his passes went for touchdowns. He was the first USC player to run for over 1,000 yards since 1927. In 1965, he ran for over 100 yards in all but one game (against Notre Dame). 

Garrett was awarded the 1965 W. J. Voit Memorial Trophy as the outstanding football player on the Pacific Coast. He won the Heisman Trophy after the 1965 regular season. In 1965, he also won the Pop Warner Award, was named Athlete of the Year by the YMCA, and North American Athlete by the Helms Foundation. In 1985, he was voted into the College Football Hall of Fame. In 2015, he was inducted into the California Sports Hall of Fame.

His nickname was &quot;Iron Mike&quot;.

Garrett signaled the dawn of the &quot;Tailback U&quot; era, where USC produced a stream of top tailbacks including Heisman winners O. J. Simpson (1968), Charles White (1979) and Marcus Allen (1981), as well as Heisman runners-up Anthony Davis (1974) and Ricky Bell (1976). He set the benchmark for all the USC tailbacks who followed him.

Garrett was a brother of the Alpha Kappa Chapter of the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity while a student at USC. He is a member of The Pigskin Club of Washington, D.C. National Intercollegiate All-American Football Players Honor Roll.

==Professional career==
In 1966, the AFL and NFL still had separate drafts and competed for players. Garrett had also been drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates to play baseball, and there were rumors that he had an interest in playing for the Los Angeles Rams if they would make him their first pick, or that he had already signed with the Oakland Raiders. So even though he had won the Heisman Trophy, he was not taken until the 20th round of the 1966 AFL draft by the Kansas City Chiefs (178th out of 181 players chosen). The Rams took him with the second pick of the second round in the 1966 NFL draft, but he chose the Chiefs.

Garrett went on to play in the American Football League (AFL) with Kansas City Chiefs from 1966 to 1969, and in 1970 for the Chiefs in the National Football League after the leagues merged. During the 1970 season, he was traded to the San Diego Chargers and remained with them until 1973.

Garrett was a two-time AFL All-Star, in 1966 and 1967, and was selected first team All AFL in 1967. He played in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game, now referred to as Super Bowl I, with the Chiefs after the 1966 season. He contributed 17 rushing yards, three receptions for 28 yards, and two kickoff returns for 43 yards in their loss. Garrett won a World Championship ring with the Chiefs in Super Bowl IV, the last AFL–NFL World Championship Game before the AFL–NFL merger, when the AFL&#x27;s Chiefs beat the NFL&#x27;s Vikings, 23–7. Garrett was the top rusher of Super Bowl IV with 11 carries for 39 yards and a touchdown, also catching two passes for 25 yards and returning a kickoff for 18 yards. His touchdown came on head coach Hank Stram&#x27;s iconic 65 Toss Power Trap play call. Garrett led the Chiefs in rushing three times.

After being traded to San Diego during the 1970 season, he rushed for nearly 600 yards in 1971 and over 1,000 yards in 1972, his highest total since 1967 and second highest for his career. 

In his eight professional football seasons, Garrett rushed for 5,481 yards, caught 238 passes for 2,010 yards, returned 14 kickoffs for 323 yards, and returned 39 punts for 235 yards. Overall, Garrett gained a total of 8,049 yards and scored 49 touchdowns (35 rushing, 13 receiving, 1 punt return).

In 1978, he was inducted into the Chiefs Hall of Honor. In 2018, he was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame.

=== Interest in professional baseball ===
Garrett had been a .300 hitter on USC&#x27;s baseball team. He was drafted three times by professional baseball teams. He was selected in the 41st round of the 1965 MLB Draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates and by the Los Angeles Dodgers twice, in the fourth round of the 1966 MLB Draft and the 35th round of the 1970 MLB Draft. In June of 1970, after winning Super Bowl IV, Garrett announced he was going to give up football to play baseball for the Dodgers, a significant motivation being his wanting to be in Los Angeles. He said the Dodgers never made him a reasonable offer, and he came back to football for the 1970 season. The Chiefs traded him to San Diego early in the season. After his final game of his first year with the Chargers, after running for 125 yards and scoring two touchdowns, he again stated he was going to retire from football to play baseball for the Dodgers. Before the start of the 1971 football season, he decided it was better for him to remain in football, and signed a two-year contract with the Chargers, and retired with the Chargers at the end of those two years.

==After professional football==
Garrett graduated with a degree in sociology from USC. While still in college he helped found the Cool Head Program, working with youth. After his professional football career, Mike Garrett earned a Juris Doctor from Western State University College of Law in 1986, but never took the bar exam. He was the director of business development for the Great Western Forum, worked in the district attorney&#x27;s office in San Diego and worked in various management positions, and was also a youth counselor. He also did color commentary for USC football telecasts.

Garrett established the East Los Angeles Youth Activities Foundation (now the Mike Garrett Foundation), in 1989. He also worked in real estate and construction firms after leaving football. He was unsuccessful in twice running for political office. In 1990, he received the NCAA&#x27;s Silver Anniversary Medal for his post-collegiate activities. 

In January 1993, Garrett returned to USC to become its sixth athletic director. He came under fire when he hired the heavily criticized Pete Carroll as head football coach in 2001, but was vindicated when USC returned to status as a dominant football power. In 2005, he allowed safety Darnell Bing who was at USC at the time to wear his retired number 20 for his senior season. In 2010, the USC football program was hit with severe NCAA sanctions, and USC self-imposed sanctions on its basketball program, in the wake of allegations about violations involving former USC stars Reggie Bush and O. J. Mayo. These sanctions have been criticized by some NCAA football writers, including ESPN&#x27;s Ted Miller, who wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s become an accepted fact among informed college football observers that the NCAA sanctions against USC were a travesty of justice, and the NCAA&#x27;s refusal to revisit that travesty are a massive act of cowardice on the part of the organization.&quot; On July 20, 2010, USC&#x27;s incoming president, Max Nikias, announced major changes in the athletic department, including Garrett&#x27;s replacement (effective August 3, 2010) by businessman and former USC quarterback Pat Haden.

In June 2013, Garrett became athletic director at the historically black college, Langston University, an NAIA school in Langston, Oklahoma. He resigned that position less than two years later. He is a board member for the Lott IMPACT Trophy, which is named after Ronnie Lott and is awarded annually to college football&#x27;s Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year.

In 2015, he was named executive director of athletics for California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA). Garrett retired from the position of Executive Director of the Athletics Department at Cal State LA in 2016, in light of claims made against the school for his using language in a sexist manner (such as babe or sweetheart) with women in his department.

<text>Sol Price (January 23, 1916 – December 14, 2009) was an American retailer and the founder of FedMart, Price Club (which ultimately merged into Costco) and PriceSmart. He was considered the &quot;father&quot; of the &quot;warehouse store&quot; retail model.

==Early life and education==
Price was born in The Bronx in New York City, the son of Samuel and Bella Price, Jewish immigrants to the United States from Minsk (Belarus), in the early years of the 20th century. The family relocated to San Diego in the early 1920s.

Price graduated from San Diego High School in 1931, attended San Diego State University in 1932, and earned his undergraduate degree (in philosophy) and Juris Doctor degrees from the University of Southern California in 1936 and 1938, respectively. By 1938, he had married his girlfriend Helen Moskowitz; they eloped to Las Vegas. Price was admitted to the California Bar in November 1938.

==Career==
Price launched the first FedMart in 1954 and, together with his son, Robert, Giles Bateman, a nephew, Rick Libenson and others, founded Price Club in 1976. The company went public in 1980. In 1993 Costco merged with Price Club to form PriceCostco. Leadership in the new organization was shared between Sol Price&#x27;s son, Robert, and James Sinegal. After eight months, PriceCostco spun a separate company called Price Enterprises, led by the younger Price. PriceSmart continues to operate warehouse clubs in Latin America and the Caribbean, while the domestic operations became Costco.

Sam Walton of Walmart wrote in his book &quot;Made in America&quot; that he &quot;borrowed&quot; &quot;as many ideas from Sol Price as from anybody else in the business&quot;. He added that he especially liked the idea of calling his discount chain &quot;Wal-Mart&quot; because he &quot;really liked Sol&#x27;s FedMart name&quot;. In 1983, Walton dined with Price and later that year the first Sam&#x27;s Club opened in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Later when asked how it felt to be the father of an industry (the warehouse retail industry—like Costco and Sam&#x27;s Club), Sol replied, &quot;I wish I&#x27;d worn a condom.&quot; Costco&#x27;s longest-serving CEO, Sinegal, learned the retail business largely through working his way up FedMart&#x27;s corporate ladder. In CNBC&#x27;s 2012 documentary on Costco, Sinegal indicated that Price had been his mentor, as well as the person who taught him to be &quot;tough&quot; in business, and to display a sense of &quot;social responsibility&quot; toward employees.

==Philanthropy==
In the late 1980s, Price donated $2 million to the construction of a new student center on the campus of University of California, San Diego. Named for Price, Price Center, which houses the main student bookstore, food court, movie theater, ballrooms, and meeting rooms, opened on April 21, 1989.

In 2011, the Price Family Charitable Fund donated $50 million to the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Policy, Planning, and Development. The school was renamed the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy as a result of the donation.

Price was responsible for injecting money and aiding the renaissance of the San Diego mid-city neighborhood of City Heights, near his childhood home. He was a member of the Board of Trustees for the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., the Board of Directors for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Consumer Affairs Advisory Committee of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the San Diego Financial Review Panel.

<text>Karol Mikuli, also known as Charles Mikuli ( or Կարոլ Պստիկյան; 22 October 1821 – 21 May 1897) was a Polish pianist, composer, conductor and teacher. His students included Moriz Rosenthal, Raoul Koczalski, Aleksander Michałowski, Jaroslaw Zieliński, Kornelia Parnas and Heinrich Schenker.

== Biographical notes ==
Mikuli (birth surname Bsdikian) was born on October 22, 1821, in Czernowitz, then part of the Austrian Empire (today Chernivtsi, Ukraine) to a Moldavian-Armenian family. He studied under Frédéric Chopin for piano (later becoming his teaching assistant) and Anton Reicha for composition. He toured widely as a concert pianist, becoming Director of the Lviv Conservatory in 1858. He founded his own school there in 1888. He died in Lemberg, then part of Austrian Galicia (today Lviv, Ukraine) and is buried in Lychakiv Cemetery in Lviv.

== Editions ==

He is most well known as an editor of works by Chopin. Dover Publications publishes reprints of his 1879 editions of Chopin&#x27;s piano music, originally published by F. Kistner (Leipzig). His aim, as stated in the foreword of the edition, was to provide more reliable editions. He used several verified sources, most of which were written or corrected by Chopin himself. His editions of Chopin&#x27;s works were first published in America in 1895.

Mikuli also took detailed notes of Chopin&#x27;s comments made in lessons and interviewed witnesses of Chopin&#x27;s performances. For many years he was regarded as the primary authority on Chopin and his remarks about Chopin&#x27;s playing were often quoted by biographers.

<doc id="1244082" wikidata="Q5162838" url="?curid=1244082" title="Medical consensus">
<text>Medical consensus is a public statement on a particular aspect of medical knowledge at the time the statement is made that a representative group of experts agree to be evidence-based and state-of-the-art (state-of-the-science) knowledge. Its main objective is to counsel Doctors on the best possible and acceptable way to diagnose and treat certain diseases or how to address a particular decision-making area. It is usually, therefore, considered an authoritative, community-based expression of a consensus decision-making and publication process.
==Methods==
There are many ways of producing medical consensus, but the most usual way is to convene an independent panel of experts, either by a medical association or by a governmental authority.

Since consensus statements provide a &quot;snapshot in time&quot; of the state of knowledge in a particular topic, they must periodically be re-evaluated and published again, replacing the previous consensus statement.

Consensus statements differ from medical guidelines, another form of state-of-the-science public statements. According to the NIH, &quot;Consensus statements synthesize new information, largely from recent or ongoing medical research, that has implications for reevaluation of routine medical practices. They do not give specific algorithms or guidelines for practice.&quot;

== History ==
From 1977 to 2013, the National Institutes of Health (United States) promoted about five to six consensus panels per year, and organized this knowledge by means of a special Consensus Development Program, managed by the NIH&#x27;s Office of Disease Prevention (ODP). It was retired in 2013 in deference to other agencies and organizations that had picked up the lead, such as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the Community Preventive Services Task Force, Institute of Medicine, and Cochrane. Its archive is available in printed form as well as for downloading from the Internet.

<doc id="1244109" wikidata="Q1004828" url="?curid=1244109" title="Light organ">
<text>A light organ is an electronic device which automatically converts an audio signal (such as music) into rhythmic light effects. In the 1970s, light organs were a popular lighting effect used in discotheques and dance parties; and also during that period, the home entertainment manufacturer Morse-Electrophonic produced some of their stereo systems with a built-in light organ display (such as their &quot;Stereo Bar&quot;). The multicolored lights of the light organ would pulsate to the beat of the music.

==Technology==
The circuit of a light organ separates the audio signal into frequency bands and controls the light channels according to the average level of each band using dimmers. A typical party light organ of the 1970s had three spotlights, red, green and blue, for sounds in bass, medium frequency and high frequency.

Due to their simple structure, light organs were popular as DIY projects for electronics hobbyists in the 1970s and can still be found for sale on the internet.

In 1971, the Rickenbacker guitar company offered their 331LS &quot;Lightshow&quot; model (and matching bass, model 4005LS), the body of which contained a three-channel light organ (with a dimmer); each channel corresponded to the pitch of the strings being played. The soundboard on these models was replaced with thin Plexiglas cutouts over a translucent moire diffraction material.

With the widespread adoption of cheap PCs, some hobbyists started experimenting with using PCs for frequency analysis instead of analog filters.

<doc id="1244130" wikidata="Q7751582" url="?curid=1244130" title="The Minnesota Review">
<text>The Minnesota Review is a literary magazine covering literary and cultural studies which places a special emphasis on politically engaged criticism, fiction, and poetry. Issues are often &quot;themed,&quot; recent issues examining the nature of academic publishing, of academic celebrity, and of &quot;smart&quot; working class kids&#x27; experiences as adults or children within the educational system. &quot;The Minnesota Review&quot; is currently based at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, and edited by the MFA program. The journal is published by Duke University Press.

==History==
&quot;The Minnesota Review&quot; was established in 1960 in Minnesota. Some of the early editors were from Macalester College, but early issues have a disclaimer against affiliation with any university. The magazine was oriented toward publishing avant garde fiction, poetry, and graphic work. From 1982, edited by Fred Pfeil and Michael Sprinker, it began to acquire the Marxist overtones and emphasis on literary theory for which it would later be known. Under the editorship of Jeffrey Williams, it moved from explicit Marxism toward politically conscious cultural studies.

==Editors==

<doc id="1244138" wikidata="Q5014347" url="?curid=1244138" title="CSS Selma">
<text>CSS Selma was a steamship in the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War. She served in the Confederate Navy first as &quot;Florida&quot;, and later as &quot;Selma&quot;. She was captured by the Union Navy steamer USS &quot;Metacomet&quot; during the Battle of Mobile Bay. She served as USS &quot;Selma&quot; until the end of the war, when she was decommissioned and sold for use as a merchant ship.

== Construction and conversion ==
&quot;Selma&quot; was built as the coastwise packet &quot;Florida&quot; at Mobile, Alabama in 1856 for the Mobile Mail Line. She was inspected and accepted by Captain Lawrence Rousseau, CSN, on April 22, 1861, acquired by the Confederacy in June, cut down and strengthened by hog frames and armed as a gunboat — all, apparently, in the Lake Pontchartrain area. Her upper deck was plated at this time with iron, partially protecting her boilers, of the low pressure type preferred for fuel economy and greater safety in battle. CSS &quot;Florida&quot; is cited on November 12, 1861 as already in commission and serving Commodore G. N. Rollins&#x27; New Orleans defense flotilla under command of Lieutenant Charles W. Hays, CSN.

The &quot;Mobile Evening News&quot; editorialized early in December on the startling change &quot;from her former gay, first-class hotel appearance, having been relieved of her upper works and painted as black as the inside of her smokestack. She carries a jib forward and, we suppose, some steering sail aft, when requisite.&quot;

==Service as &quot;Florida&quot;==
Although much of &quot;Florida&quot;&#x27;s time was spent blockaded in Mobile, she made some forays into Mississippi Sound, two of which alarmed the United States Navy&#x27;s entire Gulf command. On October 19, &quot;Florida&quot; convoyed a merchantman outside. Fortunately for her, the coast was clear of Union ships and batteries, for &quot;Florida&quot; fouled the area&#x27;s main military telegraph line with her anchor, and had no sooner repaired the damage than she went aground for 36 hours. Luck returning, she tried out her guns on , &quot;a large three-masted propeller&quot; she mistook for the faster . Being of shallower draft and greater speed, she successfully dodged &quot;Massachusetts&quot; in shoal water off Ship Island. The havoc caused by one well-placed shot with her rifled pivot gun is described by Commander Melancton Smith, USN, commanding &quot;Massachusetts&quot;;

It entered the starboard side abaft the engine five feet above the water line, cutting entirely through 18 planks of the main deck, carried away the table, sofas, eight sections of iron steam pipe, and exploded in the stateroom on the port side, stripping the bulkheads of four rooms, and setting fire to the vessel ... 12 pieces of the fragments have been collected and weigh 58 pounds.

The first sortie by &quot;Florida&quot; caused consternation. Captain Levin M. Powell, USN, in command at Ship Island — soon to be main advance base for the New Orleans campaign — wrote to Flag Officer William McKean, October 22;

The first of the reported gun steamers made her experimental trial trip on the Massachusetts, and, if she be a sample of the rest, you may perhaps consider that Ship Island and the adjacent waters will require a force of a special kind in order to hold them to our use. The caliber and long range of the rifled cannon from which the shell that exploded in the Massachusetts was fired established the ability of these fast steam gunboats to keep out of the range of all broadside guns, and enables them to disregard the armament or magnitude of all ships thus armed, or indeed any number of them, when sheltered by shoal water.

Protecting CSS &quot;Pamilico&quot;, in contrasting white dress and laden with some 400 troops, &quot;the black rebel steamer&quot; &quot;Florida&quot; on December 4 had a brush with in Horn Island Pass that caused jubilation in the Southern press. Commander T. Darrah Shaw of &quot;Montgomery&quot;, finding his shell gun no match for &quot;Florida&quot;&#x27;s long-range rifles, signaled Commander Melancton Smith for assistance, and when it was not forthcoming, ran back to safety under the guns of Ship Island. Shaw saved &quot;Montgomery&quot; and lost his command for fleeing from the enemy. Commodore McKean promptly sent Lieutenant James Edward Jouett to relieve him and forwarded Shaw&#x27;s action report to United States Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, noting, &quot;It needs no comment.&quot; Crowed &quot;Richmond Dispatch&quot; on December 14, quoting &quot;Mobile Evening News&quot;, &quot;The &quot;Florida&quot; fought at great disadvantage in one respect, owing to her steering apparatus being out of order, but showed a decided superiority in the effectiveness of her armament. That gun which scared the &quot;Massachusetts&quot; so badly, and had nearly proved fatal to her, is evidently a better piece or must be better handled than any which the enemy have.&quot;

==Service as &quot;Selma&quot;==
With the advent of cruiser CSS &quot;Florida&quot;, she was renamed &quot;Selma&quot; in July 1862, Lieutenant Peter U. Murphey, CSN, assuming command.

On February 5, 1863, while steaming down Mobile Bay with 100 extra men in search of a blockader to carry by boarding, &quot;Selma&quot; was bilged by a snag in crossing Dog River Bar, entrance to Mobile, and sank in 8 feet of water. Pumped out hastily, she was back in service February 13.

By the following year, &quot;Selma&quot;, CSS &quot;Morgan&quot; and CSS &quot;Gaines&quot;, the only ships capable of defending lower Mobile Bay, were having a serious problem with deserting seamen, and intelligence reported &quot;Selma&quot;&#x27;s crew as having fallen as low as 15 men about mid-February.
At the crucial Battle of Mobile Bay, the largest naval engagement of the Civil War on August 5, 1864, &quot;Selma,&quot; captained by Lt. Peter Umstead &quot;Capt. Pat&quot; Murphey, was one of three small Confederate gunboats present. She particularly annoyed Rear Admiral David Farragut, USN by a steady, raking fire as she stood off &#x27;s bow. After passing the forts, Farragut ordered gunboat , captained by James Jouett, cast loose from &quot;Hartford&quot; to pursue &quot;Selma&quot;. After an hour-long running fight, Murphey, unable to escape to shallow water, had to surrender to the faster, more heavily armed &quot;Metacomet&quot;. &quot;Selma&quot; lost 7 killed and 8 wounded, including Murphey, who suffered an injured arm. The &quot;Selma&quot; was the last Confederate ship to surrender at the Battle of Mobile Bay.

That evening, Admiral Farragut commissioned the prize gunboat as USS &quot;Selma&quot; and placed her under the command of Arthur R. Yates, USN. Five days later, &quot;Selma&quot; joined in the Union Navy&#x27;s bombardment of Fort Morgan. On August 16, she participated in a reconnaissance expedition up the Dog River.

In January 1865, &quot;Selma&quot; was transferred to New Orleans where she served until decommissioned on July 16, 1865. Sold at auction the same day to G. A. Hall, &quot;Selma&quot; was redocumented for merchant service on August 17, 1865 and foundered on June 24, 1868 south of Galveston, Texas, off the mouth of the Brazos River.

<doc id="1244148" wikidata="Q5332993" url="?curid=1244148" title="Eclipse (cigarette)">
<text>Eclipse is an American cigarette brand that was developed and marketed by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco. It heats the tobacco instead of burning it by using a carbon tip wrapped in glass fibers. In 2014 they were still in production, and one of the remaining choices allowed to be smoked in the offices of R.J. Reynolds facilities after the company began to restrict traditional smoking in their office facilities. They were retested in Wisconsin as &quot;Revo&quot; in 2015.

==History==

Revo is essentially the same as Eclipse, but with a different appearance. It primarily heated tobacco instead of burning it. The price was close to a premium pack of traditional cigarettes. Eclipse continues to be available in limited supply, as of 2014.

In July 2015 the CEO of Reynolds said they &quot;planned to discontinue its heat-not-burn cigarette Revo, which it began testing in Wisconsin in February. She said consumer adoption rates failed to meet expectations.&quot;

==Safety==
The American Cancer Society argues that the cigarettes are not as safe as the marketing campaign suggests, and that they should be removed from the marketplace: although they produce less tar and produce less second-hand smoke, this leads to a false sense of security, since the cigarette still contains high amounts of carcinogens. Other concerns are that they produce more carbon monoxide than regular cigarettes. R. J. Reynolds has countered by claiming that the company is not trying to market a &quot;safe&quot; cigarette, only a better alternative.

<doc id="1244159" wikidata="Q3319109" url="?curid=1244159" title="William M. Gray">
<text>William Mason Gray was an American meteorologist who was emeritus professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University (CSU), and the head of the Tropical Meteorology Project at CSU&#x27;s Department of Atmospheric Sciences. He is widely regarded as a pioneer in the science of tropical cyclone forecasting and one of the world&#x27;s leading experts on tropical storms. After retiring as a faculty member at CSU in 2005, Gray remained actively involved in both climate change and tropical cyclone research until his death.

==Early life and career==
Gray was born on 9 October 1929, in Detroit, Michigan, and was the eldest son of Ulysses S. Gray and Beatrice Mason Gray. His family moved to Washington, D.C. in 1939 where he graduated from Wilson High School. In 1952, Gray received a B.S. degree in geography from George Washington University before joining the United States Air Force in 1953. Over the next four years, he served as an overseas weather forecast officer, primarily stationed in the Azores and England. Upon returning to the United States in 1957, he began work as a research assistant at the University of Chicago Department of Meteorology from 1957 to 1961. During his time there, he earned a M.S. in meteorology 1959 and went on to earn a PhD in geophysical sciences in 1964 under the mentorship of Herbert Riehl.

He joined Colorado State University (CSU) in 1961 as part of the Department of Atmospheric Science. Gray remained active in the Air Force Reserves until 1974, at which time he retired as a Lieutenant colonel. Following his retirement from the Reserves, he became a professor at CSU and went on to advise successful 20 PhD and 50 M.S. graduates. Eight of his students received awards from the American Meteorological Society while under his mentorship. Many of his students went on to become prominent members of the meteorological community, with several working at the National Hurricane Center. His last student was Philip Klotzbach, who later took over Gray&#x27;s position as lead author of the CSU seasonal hurricane forecasts.

Gray worked closely with the World Meteorological Organization throughout his career. Starting in 1978, he traveled to numerous countries establish or improve connections with meteorologists across the globe, a groundbreaking action. In 1985, he organized the first International Workshop on Tropical Cyclones in Bangkok, Thailand.

 Gray had many students and he offered them advice including his &quot;commandments&quot;. One of them was &quot;Remember Up-Moist, Down-Dry and Keep it Holy&quot; which was the reference to his conviction that one has to include moisture processes such as evaporation and rainfall to understand atmospheric energy balance. &quot;Thou Shalt Not Concern Thyself Unduly with Commandments and Regulations&quot; expressed his disdain for bureaucracy. Being an observational atmospheric scientist, he detested numerical models of the atmosphere—&quot;Thou Shalt Not Bow Before Computer Terminals Nor Involve Thyself with Numerical Models&quot;. He held very lively group meetings with his students and encouraged them to question everything—&quot;Remember Thy Project Meeting and Keep it Holy&quot;, &quot;Thou Shalt Not Wait &#x27;til the End of a Talk to Ask a Question When Thou Can Interrupt in the Middle&quot;.

==Personal life==
On 1 October 1954, Gray married Nancy Price and they had four children together: Sarah, Anne (deceased), Janet, and Robert. They remained married until Price&#x27;s death in 2001. Gray was a fan of baseball and followed the then Washington Senators (now known as the Texas Rangers). He initially sought a career in baseball or basketball but a knee injury at age 21 prevented him from pursuing such.

==Research==
Among Gray&#x27;s most prominent achievements were the establishment of seasonal hurricane forecasts and finding that hurricane activity is cyclical. He is widely regarded as a pioneer in hurricane research, particularly for the seasonal forecasts. Throughout his career, Gray published more than 80 papers and 60 research reports. Klotzbach referred to him as &quot;one of the greatest minds in hurricane research&quot;.

===Seasonal hurricane forecasts===
In the late 1970s, Gray noticed a trend of low hurricane activity in the North Atlantic basin during El Niño years. He was the first researcher to make a connection between such events and positive results led him to pursue further research. He found numerous factors across the globe influence tropical cyclone activity, such as connecting wet periods over the African Sahel to an increase in major hurricane landfalls along the United States East Coast. However, his findings also showed inconsistencies when only looking at a single factor as a primary influence.

Utilizing his findings, Gray developed an objective, statistical forecast for seasonal hurricane activity; he predicted only the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes, foregoing specifics on tracks and potential landfalls due to the aforementioned inconsistencies. Gray issued his first seasonal forecast ahead of the 1984 season, which used the statistical relationships between tropical cyclone activity, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), and Caribbean basin sea-level pressures. The endeavor proved modestly successful. He subsequently issued forecasts ahead of the start of the Atlantic hurricane season in May and before the peak of the season in August. Students and colleagues joined his forecast team in the following years, including Christopher Landsea, Paul W. Mielke Jr., and Kenneth J. Berry.

After the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, Gray announced that he was stepping back from the primary authorship of CSU&#x27;s tropical cyclone probability forecasts, passing the role to Philip J. Klotzbach. Gray indicated that he would be devoting more time to the issue of global warming. He did not attribute global warming to anthropogenic causes, and was critical of those who did.

===Climate change===
Following Gray&#x27;s retirement from CSU&#x27;s faculty, he took a stance against anthropogenic global warming. Gray claimed that scientists supported the scientific consensus on climate change because they were afraid of losing grant funding and promoted by government leaders and environmentalists seeking world government. Although he agreed that global warming was taking place, he argued that humans were only responsible for a tiny portion and it was largely part of the Earth&#x27;s natural cycle. In June 2011, Gray wrote a paper directed at the American Meteorological Society, opposing their embrace of anthropogenic global warming.

Peter Webster, a Georgia Institute of Technology professor, was part of the anonymous peer review on several of Gray&#x27;s National Science Foundation proposals. In every case he has turned down the global warming research component because he believed it was not up to standards, but recommended that Gray&#x27;s hurricane research be funded. Webster, who co-authored papers with Gray, was critical of Gray for his personal attacks on the scientists with whom he disagreed.

==Awards and honors==
Throughout his career, Gray received several awards for his pioneering research and mentorship:

* Fellow at the American Meteorological Society (AMS)
* 1992: Colorado State University Jack E. Cermak Graduate School Award for Outstanding Adviser
* 1993: Co-recipient of the American Meteorological Society Banner I. Miller Award

<doc id="1244164" wikidata="Q6186586" url="?curid=1244164" title="Jesse Lee Peterson">
<text>Jesse Lee Peterson (born May 22, 1949) is an American conservative talk show host, political commentator and Christian minister.

As a Black American raised in the Jim Crow era, Peterson has gained notoriety for his staunchly traditional political and religious views, and has been accused of being white nationalist in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blumenthal 2005 https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/minister-minstrelsy 23&quot;&gt; &quot;For white nationalists determined to intimidate and marginalize aspirant ethnic minorities, Peterson could embolden their crusade. It&#x27;s no wonder both factions have promoted him so aggressively&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Peterson was born on May 22, 1949, in Midway, Alabama, and raised in Comer Hill by his grandparents, who worked on the Comer family plantation where his great-grandparents had worked as slaves a century earlier. His mother and father moved to Gary, Indiana, and East Chicago, Indiana, respectively, where they separately started new families of their own. He was born with a cleft palate that was not repaired until his teens. Peterson lived with his mother and stepfather in Gary as a teenager, briefly attending Edison High School. He then returned to Alabama and graduated from high school before moving to Los Angeles. He attended Los Angeles City College for one year. He says that he started his own janitorial service in 1989.

==Political involvement==
In 1990, Peterson founded BOND (Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny), later registered as a religious non-profit. BOND had close ties to the Tea Party movement. Advisory board members have included Sean Hannity and Dennis Prager.

Peterson has participated in activism against illegal immigration, abortion, gun control, and for traditional family values. He has protested against the NAACP and feminist lawyer Gloria Allred. He has participated in discussions at the annual political convention Politicon.

From 1999 to 2004, Peterson chose Martin Luther King Jr. Day to hold a &quot;National Day of Repudiation of Jesse Jackson&quot; to highlight his opposition to Jackson, who was near King when he was assassinated.

In 2001, while meeting with Toyota executives in Los Angeles, Peterson accused Jackson of threatening him and his son Jonathan Jackson of assaulting him. In 2006, a jury cleared Jesse Jackson of the threat allegation, but was split on his son&#x27;s assault allegation. Conservative activist organization Judicial Watch provided attorneys for Peterson in the lawsuit.

In 2002, Peterson debated Michael Eric Dyson on &quot;The Case For/Against Reparations for African Americans,&quot; hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists.

Conservative talk radio host Dennis Prager wrote the forewords to two of Peterson&#x27;s books.

Peterson&#x27;s radio show was simulcast on Newsmax TV in 2017–2018.

In June 2019, video-sharing platform YouTube demonetized Peterson&#x27;s channel, amongst many others, under an updated hate speech policy.

Peterson appears in the 2020 political documentary &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;, produced by radio host Larry Elder.

==Political views==
Peterson has stated that he used to be a Democrat but became a Republican in his late 30s. He attributed the change to his Christian beliefs.

=== Race ===
Peterson opposes allowing Muslims to serve in Western governments, and says that racism does not exist. Instead, he believes that every conflict is a spiritual &quot;battle between good and evil&quot;. He has spoken out against Kwanzaa and Black History Month. Peterson&#x27;s views have been described by some authors as being consistent with white supremacy, and it has been suggested that white nationalists are encouraged by his rhetoric and compelled to promote him, because Peterson&#x27;s blackness reduces the shock value of opinions that would be considered outrageous if a white person had expressed them.

In 2005, he stated that most African Americans stranded in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina were relying on the government to save them. In 2012, Peterson said about black unemployment, &quot;One of the things that I would do is take all black people back to the South and put them on the plantation ... They need a good hard education on what it is to work.&quot; He has called Nelson Mandela an &quot;evil man&quot; and said that South Africa was better off under apartheid. In 2020, he called then-U.S. President Donald Trump &quot;the Great White Hope&quot;.

In 2013, Peterson called Trayvon Martin a &quot;thug&quot;. CNN host Piers Morgan called Peterson&#x27;s comments &quot;quite offensive&quot;. In 2015 on political commentator Sean Hannity&#x27;s show, Peterson defended Michael Slager, a former North Charleston, South Carolina, police officer who killed Walter Lamar Scott, an unarmed black man, by shooting him in the back. Peterson criticized &quot;angry black folks in this country&quot; who disobey instructions of police, while Hannity pushed back against Peterson and called the killing &quot;cold-blooded&quot;. Fellow panelist Leo Terrell walked out of the interview prematurely. In 2017, Slager was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the killing.

In 2018, Peterson compared the Black Lives Matter movement to the Ku Klux Klan, saying that each could be described as an &quot;agitative organization founded by... black lesbians and homosexuals.&quot; In response, &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; host Piers Morgan accused Peterson of homophobia, and Peterson&#x27;s microphone was muted before he was kicked off the show.

In 2019, Peterson called activist Andrew Yang a &quot;communist&quot; and &quot;beta male&quot; for his universal basic income proposal. Peterson said Yang, an American born in New York, &quot;should go back to China or wherever he came from.&quot;

In 2022, Peterson gave a speech at the third America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC), which was organised by Nick Fuentes and attended by Marjorie Taylor Greene. AFPAC has been described as a white nationalist political action committee. The Anti-Defamation League described Peterson&#x27;s speech as the &quot;one of the most racist&quot; of all delivered at the event, in which he described black people as the destroyers of America.

=== Marriage and women ===
Peterson opposes premarital sex. During an interview with former SlutWalk organizer Amber Rose, Peterson responded to the question &quot;if women are sluts what does that make you?&quot; by stating men are &quot;slut makers&quot;.

Peterson&#x27;s views on women have been described as misogynistic. Peterson stated in a 2012 sermon that &quot;one of the greatest mistakes America made was to allow women the opportunity to vote.&quot; He stated that women &quot;can&#x27;t handle power in the right way&quot;, that they &quot;have no patience&quot;, and &quot;don&#x27;t have love&quot;. Political analyst Kirsten Powers confronted Peterson on Sean Hannity&#x27;s program on Fox News, accusing him of using his status as a pastor to preach hatred and fear of women.

== Personal life ==
Peterson has one son. He has been engaged twice but never married.

<text>Trans World Corporation was the original name of the holding company set up to own Trans World Airlines.

==History==
In 1967, when the airline sought to diversify into other areas of business, a key investment was &quot;Hilton International Hotels&quot;, the non-American interests of the Hilton Hotels chain. (Because of this split, the Hilton International chain had to call its hotels in America &quot;Vista&quot;, while future overseas locations of the American Hilton chain were called &quot;Conrad International&quot;. This operation was later sold by Trans World Corporation while under the leadership of Charles C. Tillinghast Jr. the CEO of TWA and the first known to receive a golden parachute employment contract.

In 1983, Trans World Corporation, under Chief Executive 
Officer L. Edwin Smart, spun off Trans World Airlines to Carl C. Icahn,

At the time of TWA&#x27;s spinoff, TWC owned Spartan Food Systems Inc., the Canteen Corporation, Hilton International, and Century 21 Real Estate Corporation.

As a result of both Trans World Airlines and Trans World Corporation being publicly traded prior to the spinoff, public records permitted analysis which indicates that &quot;wealth transfer&quot; of a sale of TWA was as much a reason for the sale of TWA as was a desirability to &quot;restructure union contracts&quot;. Conversely, it was circa 1982-1984 when UAL Corporation and AMR Corporation, the parent companies of United Airlines and American Airlines first took shape. This period is also an era marked by extremely competitive airline industry forces fighting for deregulation survival along with fighting for opportunities of vast individual creations of wealth characterized by those accumulated by leading industry figures such as Frank Lorenzo and Carl Icahn during the 1980s.

In 1986, TWC was liquidated. TW Services was formed at end of 1986 upon the dissolution of Transworld Corp. L. Edwin Smart remained head of TW Services Inc., the successor of Trans World Corporation which remained headquartered in the same building and shared many directors as Trans World Corporation. TW Services Inc. continued the use of the TW ticker symbol on the NYSE. Its business centered on food services and retirement care.

TW Services was the target of several hostile take over attempts which ended in June 1989 when TW Services agreed to be taken over by Conniston Partners for $1.65 billion. As part of the buy out, TW Services moved its headquarters from New York City to Spartanburg, South Carolina.

==Flagstar Companies==
In 1992, private equity firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired a 47% interest in TW Corporation, later known as The Flagstar Companies, and encouraged the company to sell non-core businesses. The following year, TW Services changed its name to The Flagstar Companies in its bid to focus on the food service industry with a portfolio of businesses including Volume Services America, Hardee&#x27;s, Quincy&#x27;s Family Steakhouse, El Pollo Loco, Canteen Corporation and Denny&#x27;s.

After accumulating $2.2 billion in debt, Flagstar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors in a Federal bankruptcy court in South Carolina in July 1997. Six months later, Flagstar emerged from bankruptcy as Advantica Restaurant Group Inc. and with three-fourths of its stock controlled by four of the former Flagstar&#x27;s senior creditors. At the time of emergence, Advantica owned Denny&#x27;s, Carrows, Coco&#x27;s, El Pollo Loco and Quincy&#x27;s Family Steakhouse and was the largest franchisee of Hardee&#x27;s restaurants. Advantica paid off its inherited debt by selling off most of its holdings.

In November 1999, Advantica sold El Pollo Loco to an investment firm for $114 Million plus the assumption of $14 million in debt.

Today the remnants of the corporation are Denny&#x27;s.

Trans World Corporation was the predecessor of the way and manner in which many of the airlines with holdings and holding parent companies conduct and create their business structural organization.

<text>The Lada Niva Travel is a mini sport utility vehicle (SUV) produced since 1998 by the AvtoVAZ Group. Originally called the VAZ-2123 (1998–2002), the SUV was marketed as the Chevrolet Niva from 2003 to 2020, when AvtoVAZ (the parent company of the Lada brand) was in a joint venture with General Motors, called GM-AvtoVAZ.

However, after General Motors sold its 50-percent stake in the firm in 2020, the car was for a short time rebranded as the Lada Niva, giving the car then the &quot;same&quot; name that the &quot;original&quot;, 1977-launched Lada Niva/ Lada 4x4/ VAZ-2121 &quot;still&quot; has, in certain European markets — while the VAZ-2123 is also &quot;a development of&quot; its predecessor, VAZ-2121&#x27;s mechanical underpinnings.&lt;br&gt;
On 21 December 2020, the car was rebranded the &#x27;Lada Niva Travel&#x27;.

==Overview==
=== VAZ-2123 (1998 - 2002) ===
The VAZ-2123 was developed as a 5-door CUV, riding on a wheelbase – the exact middle of the original Lada Niva (Legend) wheelbases of and . Although the body and the interiors are all new, it is still based on the old VAZ 2121 engine, transmission and most mechanicals.

The Niva rebadging featured a touched-up body, and the 1.7-litre gasoline engine has fuel injection.

In 2003, the car was awarded zero stars out of a possible four by the Russian ARCAP safety assessment program.


=== Chevrolet Niva (2003 - 2020) ===
In 2002, an agreement was signed with the American company General Motors to establish serial production of the model and a joint venture GM-AVTOVAZ was created: the license for the VAZ-2123 model and the rights to the Niva brand were transferred to a joint venture (while the first generation of Niva from 2006 became known: &quot;4×4&quot;).

An export version with reinforced bodyshell, 1.8-litre Opel Ecotec Family 1 gasoline engine, and Aisin four-wheel drive was under consideration since 2003. Although most of the engineering work was completed, the release was repeatedly postponed. Although GM-AvtoVAZ considered building a new engine plant for the local production of Ecotec engines, in July 2005 it was announced that the project was cancelled, along with plans for the long-anticipated &quot;export&quot; Niva. However, the project was revived in autumn 2006 and the &quot;Niva FAM1&quot; was introduced as a new trim level for the 2007 model year. The price was much higher than the standard trim, which led to slow sales and the discontinuation of this model in April 2008. Another reason was the ceasing of Ecotec engine production at the Hungarian plant.

In 2009, the model got a minor update, featuring a slight restyling, done by Bertone studio and some minor-changes. The GLS and GLC version also comes with improved safety, such as ABS and dual front airbags.


=== Lada Niva / Lada Niva Travel (2020 - Present) ===
In August 2020 Lada took over production of the Chevrolet Niva, rebranding it as the Lada Niva.

In December 2020, following a new generation of the car, the new Lada Niva was further rebranded as Lada Niva Travel, while the old Niva 4x4 was rebranded as Lada Niva Legend in January 2021.


== Concept Cars ==
=== Chevrolet Niva Concept (2014) ===

GM-AvtoVAZ introduced a concept vehicle for a new generation of the Chevrolet Niva at the Moscow International Automobile Salon in late August 2014. The Niva Concept, designed by Ondrej Koromház of GM (or at General Motors&#x27; headquarters in Melbourne according to other sources), had a longitudinal mounted engine, full-time four-wheel-drive, two-gear transfer case and rigid-axle rear suspension. The production model was supposed to get a 1.8-liter PSA Peugeot Citroën EC8 engine (135 hp) paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox, although more recent news reports suggested that it was planned to be based on the Renault Duster platform. The new model&#x27;s production version was initially expected in 2016, but following Chevrolet stopping sales of its mainstream models in Russia, no further information has been released on the topic.

In September 2018, it was reported that GM has suspended all the work on planned replacement of Chevrolet Niva.

===Lada 4x4 Vision Concept (2018)===
In May 2018 AvtoVAZ patented the new concept car called the Lada 4x4 Vision. At a Moscow International Automobile Salon in August 2018, AvtoVAZ presented the concept, built in honour of the original Niva&#x27;s 40th anniversary. According to preliminary information, the car would be based on Renault Duster and production is scheduled to start in 2022 at the earliest.

<doc id="1244173" wikidata="Q1143398" url="?curid=1244173" title="Ultramafic rock">
<text>Ultramafic rocks (also referred to as ultrabasic rocks, although the terms are not wholly equivalent) are igneous and meta-igneous rocks with a very low silica content (less than 45%), generally &gt;18% MgO, high FeO, low potassium, and are usually composed of greater than 90% mafic minerals (dark colored, high magnesium and iron content). The Earth&#x27;s mantle is composed of ultramafic rocks. Ultrabasic is a more inclusive term that includes igneous rocks with low silica content that may not be extremely enriched in Fe and Mg, such as carbonatites and ultrapotassic igneous rocks.

==Intrusive ultramafic rocks==
Intrusive ultramafic rocks are often found in large, layered ultramafic intrusions where differentiated rock types often occur in layers. Such cumulate rock types do not represent the chemistry of the magma from which they crystallized. The ultramafic intrusives include the dunites, peridotites and pyroxenites. Other rare varieties include troctolite which has a greater percentage of calcic plagioclase. These grade into the anorthosites. Gabbro and norite often occur in the upper portions of the layered ultramafic sequences. Hornblendite and, rarely phlogopite, are also found.

==Volcanic ultramafic rocks on Earth==
Volcanic ultramafic rocks are rare outside of the Archaean and are essentially restricted to the Neoproterozoic or earlier. Subvolcanic ultramafic rocks and dykes persist longer, but are also rare. There is evidence of ultramafic rocks elsewhere in the solar system.

Examples include komatiite and picritic basalt. Komatiites can be host to ore deposits of nickel.

=== Ultramafic tuff ===
Ultramafic tuff is extremely rare. It has a characteristic abundance of olivine or serpentine and a scarcity or absence of feldspar and quartz. Rare occurrences may include unusual surface deposits of maars of kimberlites in the diamond fields of southern Africa and other regions.

==Ultrapotassic ultramafic rocks==
Technically ultrapotassic rocks and melilitic rocks are considered a separate group, based on melting model criteria, but there are ultrapotassic and highly silica-under-saturated rocks with &gt;18% MgO which can be considered &quot;ultramafic&quot;.

Ultrapotassic, ultramafic igneous rocks such as lamprophyre, lamproite and kimberlite are known to have reached the surface of the Earth. Although no modern eruptions have been observed, analogues are preserved.

Most of these rocks occur as dikes, diatremes, lopoliths or laccoliths, and very rarely, intrusions. Most kimberlite and lamproite occurrences occur as volcanic and subvolcanic diatremes and maars; lavas are virtually unknown.

Vents of Proterozoic lamproite (Argyle diamond mine), and Cenozoic lamproite (Gaussberg, Antarctica) are known, as are vents of Devonian lamprophyre (Scotland). Kimberlite pipes in Canada, Russia and South Africa have incompletely preserved tephra and agglomerate facies.

These are generally diatreme events and as such are not lava flows although tephra and ash deposits are partially preserved. These represent low-volume volatile melts and attain their ultramafic chemistry via a different process than typical ultramafic rocks.

==Metamorphic ultramafic rocks==
Metamorphism of ultramafic rocks in the presence of water and/or carbon dioxide results in two main classes of metamorphic ultramafic rock; talc carbonate and serpentinite.

Talc carbonation reactions occur in ultramafic rocks at lower greenschist through to granulite facies metamorphism when the rock in question is subjected to metamorphism and the metamorphic fluid has more than 10% molar proportion of CO2 (carbon dioxide).

When such metamorphic fluids have less than 10% molar proportion of CO2, reactions favor serpentinisation, resulting in chlorite-serpentine-amphibole type assemblages.

==Distribution in space and time==
The majority of ultramafic rocks are exposed in orogenic belts, and predominate in Archaean and Proterozoic terranes. Ultramafic magmas in the Phanerozoic are rarer, and there are very few recognised true ultramafic lavas in the Phanerozoic.

Many surface exposures of ultramafic rocks occur in ophiolite complexes where deep mantle-derived rocks have been obducted onto continental crust along and above subduction zones.

==Soil, regolith, and biology==

Serpentine soil is a magnesium rich, calcium, potassium and phosphorus poor soil that develops on the regolith derived from ultramafic rocks. Ultramafic rocks also contain elevated amounts of chromium and nickel which may be toxic to plants. As a result, a distinctive type of vegetation develops on these soils. Examples are the ultramafic woodlands and barrens of the Appalachian mountains and piedmont, the &quot;wet maquis&quot; of the New Caledonia rain forests, and the ultramafic forests of Mount Kinabalu and other peaks in Sabah, Malaysia. Vegetation is typically stunted, and sometimes includes endemic species adapted to the soils.

Often thick, magnesite-calcrete caprock, laterite and duricrust forms over ultramafic rocks in tropical and subtropical environments. Particular floral assemblages associated with highly nickeliferous ultramafic rocks are indicative tools for mineral exploration.

Weathered ultramafic rocks may form lateritic nickel ore deposits.

Lichen communities on ultramafic rocks show distinctive characteristics, including the unusual co-presence of species that typically grow on either acidic or calcium-rich rocks, due to the rocks&#x27; unique chemical composition. While some lichen species appear to be characteristic of ultramafic environments within specific geographical regions, very few species are found exclusively on these rocks. Studies have shown that lichen communities on ultramafic rocks can be more diverse than those on adjacent mafic rocks, with some localities showing notably higher species counts on serpentinites compared to other rock types. These communities often display xerophytic characteristics and may include species with disjunct distribution patterns. The weathering action of lichens on ultramafic rocks can promote biogeochemical processes, including the complete depletion of magnesium from serpentine minerals beneath lichen thalli and the formation of secondary minerals common in serpentine soils.

==Other celestial bodies==

=== Io ===
Ultramafic lava may have been detected on Io, a moon of Jupiter, because heat-mapping of Io&#x27;s surface found ultra-hot areas with temperatures in excess of . The magma immediately below these hot spots is probably about hotter, based on surface-to-subsurface temperature differences observed for lava on Earth. A temperature of is thought to indicate the presence of ultramafic magma.

=== Mercury ===
Mercury appears to have ultramafic volcanic rock.

<doc id="1244192" wikidata="Q1975114" url="?curid=1244192" title="Nekomata">
<text>Nekomata (original form: , later forms: , , ) are a kind of cat &quot;yōkai&quot; described in Japanese folklore, classical kaidan, essays, etc. There are two very different types: those that live in the mountains and domestic cats that have grown old and transformed into &quot;yōkai&quot;. 

&quot;Nekomata&quot; are often confused with &quot;bakeneko&quot;. The Nekomata has multiple tails, while the Bakeneko has one. Additionally while the Bakeneko is often mischievous and playful, the Nekomata is considered far more malicious in its behaviour.

==Mountain Nekomata==

&quot;Nekomata&quot; appear in stories even earlier than in Japan. In the Sui dynasty, the words and described mysterious cats. In Japanese literature, the &quot;nekomata&quot; first appeared in the &quot;Meigetsuki&quot; by Fujiwara no Teika in the early Kamakura period: in the beginning of Tenpuku (1233), August 2, in Nanto (now Nara Prefecture), a nekomata () was said to have killed and eaten several people in one night. The nekomata was described as a mountain beast: according to the Meigetsuki, &quot;They have eyes like a cat, and have a large body like a dog.&quot; An essay in Yoshida Kenkō &#x27;s 1331 &quot;Tsurezuregusa&quot; asserts, &quot;.&quot; 

Many people question whether the nekomata is a cat monster. Since people are said to suffer an illness called &quot;&quot;, some interpret the &quot;nekomata&quot; to be a beast that has caught rabies.

Even in the kaidan collections, the &quot;&quot; and the &quot;,&quot; &quot;nekomata&quot; conceal themselves in mountain recesses. There are stories that deep in the mountains they shapeshift into humans. In folk religion there are many stories of mountainous &quot;nekomata&quot;. In later literature, the mountain &quot;nekomata&quot; tend to be larger. In the &quot;&quot; &quot;nekomata&quot; captured in the mountains of Kii Province are as large as a wild boar; in the &quot; of 1775 (Anei 4), their roaring echos throughout the mountain, and they can be seen as big as a lion or leopard. In the &quot; of 1809 (Bunka 6), a &quot;nekomata&quot; that held a dog in its mouth was described as having a span of 9 shaku and 5 sun (about 2.8 meters).

In Etchū Province (now Toyama Prefecture), in Aizu, at Nekomatayama said to be where &quot;nekomata&quot; would devour humans (now Fukushima Prefecture), &quot;nekomata&quot; that shapeshift into humans and deceive people, like Mount Nekomadake, the legends sometimes are named after the name of the associated mountain. Regarding Nekomatayama and altogether disregarding folklore, there are large cats that attack humans.

==Domestic Cat Nekomata==
At the same time, in the setsuwa collection &quot;Kokon Chomonjū&quot;, in the story &quot;&quot;, an old cat raised in a villa on a mountain precipice held a secret treasure, a protective sword, in its mouth and ran away. People chased the cat, but it disguised itself. In the aforementioned &quot;Tsurezuregusa&quot;, aside from &quot;nekomata&quot; that conceal themselves in the mountains, there are descriptions of pet cats that grow old, transform, and eat and abduct people.

Since the Edo period, it has become generally believed that domestic cats turn into &quot;nekomata&quot; as they grow old, and mountainous &quot;nekomata&quot; have come to be interpreted as cats that have run away to live in the mountains. As a result, throughout Japan, a folk belief developed that cats should not be kept for long periods.

In the &quot;&quot; the courtier Sadatake Ise stated, &quot;A cat that is several years of age will come to have two tails, and become the &quot;yōkai&quot; called nekomata.&quot; The mid-Edo period scholar Arai Hakuseki stated, &quot;Old cats become &#x27;nekomata&#x27; and bewilder people.&quot; and indicated that at that time it was common to believe that cats become &quot;nekomata&quot;. Even the Edo-period Kawaraban reported this strange phenomenon.

In the book &quot;Yamato Kaiiki&quot; ( &quot;Mysterious stories from Japan&quot;), written by an unknown author in 1708, one story speaks of a rich samurai&#x27;s haunted house where the inhabitants witnessed several poltergeist activities. Attempting to end those events, the samurai called upon countless shamans, priests and evokers; but none of them could locate the source of the terror. One day, one of the most loyal servants saw his master&#x27;s aged cat carrying in its mouth a &quot;shikigami&quot; with the samurai&#x27;s name imprinted on it. Immediately shooting a sacred arrow, the servant hit the cat in its head; and as it lay dead on the floor, everyone could see that the cat had two tails and therefore had become a &quot;nekomata&quot;. With its death, the poltergeist activities ended. Similar eerie stories about encounters with &quot;nekomata&quot; appear in books such as &quot;Taihei Hyakumonogatari&quot; (, engl. &quot;Collection of 100 fairy tales&quot;), written by Yusuke (, or Yūsa) in 1723 and in &quot;Rōō Chabanashi&quot; (, &quot;Tea-time gossip of old ladies&quot;), by Misaka Daiyata (), 1742.

It is generally said that the &quot;mata&quot; () of &quot;nekomata&quot; refers to their having two tails, but from the perspective of folkloristics, this appears questionable. Since &quot;nekomata&quot; transform as they age, &quot;mata&quot; &quot;repetition&quot; is postulated. Alternatively, since they were once thought to be mountain beasts, there is a theory that &quot;mata&quot; () refers to monkeys since &quot;nekomata&quot; can come and go freely among the mountain trees. There is also a theory that the term derives from how cats that grow old shed the skin off their backs and hang downwards, making it appear that they have two tails.

In Japan, cats are often associated with death, and this particular spirit is usually blamed. Far darker and more malevolent than most &quot;bakeneko&quot;, the nekomata is said to have powers of necromancy and, upon raising the dead, will control them with ritualistic dances, gesturing with paw and tail. These &quot;yōkai&quot; are associated with strange fires and other inexplicable occurrences. The older and more abused a cat is before its transformation, the more power the nekomata is said to have. To gain revenge against those who wronged it, the spirit may haunt humans with visitations from their deceased relatives. Some tales state that these demons, like &quot;bakeneko&quot;, assume human appearances, usually appearing as older women, misbehaving in public, and bringing gloom and malevolence wherever they travel. Due to these beliefs, sometimes kittens&#x27; tails were cut off based on the assumption that if the tails could not fork, the cats could not become nekomata.

From this discernment and strange characteristics, nekomata have been considered devilish from time immemorial. Due to fears and folk beliefs such as the dead resurrecting at a funeral or that seven generations would be cursed due to killing a cat, it is thought that the legend of the &quot;nekomata&quot; was born. Also, in folk beliefs cats and the dead are related. As carnivores, cats have a keen sense of detecting the smell of rot, so it was believed that they had a habit of approaching corpses; with this folk belief sometimes the kasha, a &quot;yōkai&quot; that steals corpses are seen to be the same as the nekomata.

Also in Japan there are cat &quot;yōkai&quot; called &quot;bakeneko&quot;; and since nekomata are the &quot;yōkai&quot; of transformed cats, sometimes &quot;nekomata&quot; are confused with &quot;bakeneko&quot;.

==Yōkai Depictions==
In the Edo period many books illustrating and describing &quot;yōkai&quot; were published (yōkai emaki), with nekomata frequently depicted. The Hyakkai Zukan published in 1737 (Gembun 2) includes an illustration of a &quot;nekomata&quot; assuming the appearance of a woman playing a shamisen. (See the first image on this page.) Since Edo-period shamisen frequently used cat skins, that particular nekomata sang a sad song about its species as it plucked the strings. Understandably, the image has been interpreted as ironic. As for the &quot;nekomata&quot;″s wearing geisha clothing, sometimes &quot;nekomata&quot; and geisha are considered related since geisha were once called &quot;cats (&quot;neko&quot;)&quot;

Also shown at the right, the &quot;Gazu Hyakki Yagyō&quot; of 1776 (An&#x27;ei 5) depicts a cat with its head protruding from a shōji screen, a cat with a handkerchief on its head and its forepaw on the veranda, and a cat wearing a handkerchief and standing upright. The less experienced cat has difficulty standing on its hind legs. The older cat can do so: this is showing the process by which a normal cat ages and transforms into a &quot;nekomata&quot;. In the Bigelow ukiyo-e collection at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the &quot;Hyakki Yagyō Emaki&quot; includes a similar composition, leading some scholars to see a relationship between the books.

==Senri==
In Chinese lore there is a cat monster called the &quot;xiānlí&quot; ()&quot; (Japanese pronunciation &quot;senri&quot;, where &quot;&quot; means &quot;leopard cat&quot;). In this telling, leopard cats that grow old gain a divine spiritual power (&quot;xian&quot; arts), shapeshift into a beautiful man or woman, and suck the spirit out of humans. Some theorize that the Japanese nekomata legends derive from Chinese xiānlí tales.

<doc id="1244199" wikidata="Q609258" url="?curid=1244199" title="Eras (typeface)">
<text>Eras is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Albert Boton and Albert Hollenstein and was released by the International Typeface Corporation (ITC) in 1976. Eras is licensed by the Linotype type foundry.

A distinct and curious feature of Eras is its slight, 3-degree right tilt. Eras follows ITC&#x27;s formulary of increased x-height, and multiple weights from light to ultra bold, though because all weights are slightly slanted, no italic version of the font is supplied. Eras is further distinct for its open bowls on the characters a, P, R, 6, and 9. The letter W changes shape from a merged &#x27;double V&#x27; shape in the lighter variants to the standard W symbol in the bolder variants.

Four TrueType weights of this font (Light, Medium, Demi and Bold) are included with some editions of Microsoft Word, though not with the Windows operating system itself.

== Usage ==
The typeface has been widely used by Telecom Italia Mobile as a corporate typeface. TIM stopped use of Eras in 2016. It was also used in the emblem and image of the 1998 FIFA World Cup
, in the credits for the movie &quot;Caddyshack&quot;
and in the video games &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot;, &quot;Jet Ion GP&quot; and &quot;Championship Manager 01/02&quot;. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) network used the font in its on-air promotion graphics during the early to mid-1980s. A modified version of the font can be seen on the cover of Motörhead&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;No Sleep &#x27;til Hammersmith&quot;. The Stanley Kubrick movie &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; uses Eras typeface on the credits. Brazilian stock exchange Bovespa (now B3 S.A.) used the Eras typeface for its logo and tagline. A modified version of the font was used for the logo of game developer Spike (now Spike Chunsoft). Eras is the primary typeface of the Eugene Airport in Oregon.

The makers of the over-the-counter memory supplement Prevagen uses the Eras Light weight in its logotype.

<doc id="1244204" wikidata="Q132341" url="?curid=1244204" title="Bobby Timmons">
<text>Robert Henry Timmons (December 19, 1935 – March 1, 1974) was an American jazz pianist and composer. He was a sideman in Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers for two periods (July 1958 to September 1959; February 1960 to June 1961), between which he was part of Cannonball Adderley&#x27;s band. Several of Timmons&#x27; compositions written when part of these bands – including &quot;Moanin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Dat Dere&quot;, and &quot;This Here&quot; – enjoyed commercial success and brought him more attention. In the early and mid-1960s he led a series of piano trios that toured and recorded extensively.

Timmons was strongly associated with the soul jazz style that he helped initiate. This link to apparently simple writing and playing, coupled with drug and alcohol addiction, led to a decline in his career. Timmons died, aged 38, from cirrhosis. Several critics have commented that his contribution to jazz remains undervalued.

==Early life==
Timmons was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of a minister. He had a sister, Eleanor. Both of his parents, and several aunts and uncles, played the piano. From an early age Timmons studied music with an uncle, Robert Habershaw, who also taught McCoy Tyner. Timmons first played at the church where his grandfather was minister; this influenced his later jazz playing. He grew up in the same area as other future musicians, including the Heath brothers (Jimmy, Percy, and Tootie) and Lee Morgan. Timmons&#x27; first professional performances were in his local area, often as a trio that included Tootie Heath on drums. After graduating from high school Timmons was awarded a scholarship to study at the Philadelphia Musical Academy.

==1954 to spring 1961==
Timmons moved to New York in 1954. He played with Kenny Dorham in 1956, making his recording debut with the trumpeter in a live set in May of that year. He went on to play and record with Chet Baker in 1956–57 (bassist Scott LaFaro was part of this band for a time), Sonny Stitt in 1957, and Maynard Ferguson in 1957–58. He also recorded as a sideman with hornmen Curtis Fuller, Hank Mobley, and Morgan. all for Blue Note Records in 1957.

Timmons became best known as a member of Art Blakey&#x27;s band the Jazz Messengers, which he was first part of from July 1958 to September 1959, including for a tour of Europe. He was recruited for the Messengers by saxophonist Benny Golson, who said that &quot;He was inventive, [...] He could play bebop and he could play funky – he could play a lot of things, and I thought it was the element that Art needed. He hadn&#x27;t had anybody quite like Bobby, who could go here or go there, rather than walking in a single corridor.&quot; By late 1958 Timmons was sharing bandmate Morgan&#x27;s East Sixth Street apartment and the pair had bought a piano, allowing Timmons to practice and Morgan to work on composing. From around the time he joined Blakey, Timmons, along with some of his fellow band members, was a heroin user. After leaving Blakey, Timmons joined Cannonball Adderley&#x27;s band, in October 1959.

Timmons was also known as a composer during this period: &quot;The Encyclopedia of Jazz&quot; states that his compositions &quot;Moanin&#x27;&quot; (from the 1958 album of the same title), &quot;This Here&quot;, and &quot;Dat Dere&quot; &quot;helped generate the gospel-tinged &#x27;soul jazz&#x27; style of [the] late &#x27;50s and early &#x27;60s.&quot; The first was written when Timmons was first with Blakey; the others were composed when he was with Adderley. &quot;This Here&quot; (sometimes &quot;Dis Here&quot;) was a surprise commercial success for Adderley: recorded in concert in 1959, it was released as part of &quot;The Cannonball Adderley Quintet in San Francisco&quot; album while the band was still on tour, and they discovered its popularity only when they arrived back in New York and found crowds outside the Village Gate, where they were due to play.

Timmons was reported to be dissatisfied with the money he had received from &quot;This Here&quot;, and was enticed in February 1960 into leaving Adderley and returning to Blakey&#x27;s band by the offer of more pay. Timmons then appeared on further well-known albums with the drummer, including &quot;A Night in Tunisia&quot;, &quot;The Freedom Rider&quot; and &quot;The Witch Doctor&quot;. His own recording debut as sole leader was &quot;This Here Is Bobby Timmons&quot; in 1960, which contained his first versions of his best-known compositions. In the same year, he played on recordings led by Nat Adderley, Arnett Cobb, and Johnny Griffin, among others; on the first of these, &quot;Work Song&quot;, Timmons did not appear on all of the tracks, because he had been drinking heavily.

==Summer 1961 to 1974==
Timmons left Blakey for the second time in June 1961, encouraged by the success of his compositions, including jukebox plays of &quot;Dat Dere&quot;, which Oscar Brown had recorded after adding lyrics. Timmons then formed his own bands, initially with Ron Carter on bass and Tootie Heath on drums. They toured around the US, including the West Coast, but played most in and around New York. In the initial stages of this trio, Timmons liked the group sounds of the trios led by Red Garland and Ahmad Jamal. According to Tootie Heath, Timmons was at the peak of his fame at that point, but was addicted to heroin, and used a lot of the money that the band was paid maintaining his habit.

In 1963, Timmons&#x27; playing, with Lewis Powers on bass and Roy McCurdy on drums, was described by a &quot;Washington Post&quot; reviewer as &quot;flexible and adventuresome [...] Glossing over everything is an undeniable sheen of church music and spirituals.&quot; In 1965, the same reviewer commented that Timmons was employing musicians who were of much lower ability: &quot;Timmons lacks a certain passion but I wonder if this is not the fault of his sidemen.&quot; Timmons started playing vibes in the mid-1960s. He occasionally played organ, but recorded only one track on that instrument – a 1964 version of &quot;Moanin on &quot;From the Bottom&quot;. Recordings as a leader continued, usually as part of a trio or quartet, but, after joining Milestone Records around 1967, Timmons&#x27; album &quot;Got to Get It!&quot; featured him as part of a nonet, playing arrangements by Tom McIntosh.

Timmons&#x27; career declined quickly in the 1960s, in part because of drug abuse and alcoholism, and partly as a result of being typecast as a composer and player of seemingly simple pieces of music. In 1968 he made his second - and final - recording for Milestone, &quot;Do You Know the Way?&quot; In the following year, he played in a quartet led by Sonny Red, with Dexter Gordon on one of the saxophonist&#x27;s temporary returns to the US from Europe, and in a trio backing vocalist Etta Jones. Timmons continued to play in the early 1970s, mostly in small groups or in combination with other pianists, and mainly in the New York area.

According to saxophonist Jimmy Heath, Timmons joined Clark Terry&#x27;s big band for a tour of Europe in 1974. He was unwell and drank on the plane to Sweden, and fell while drinking at the bar before the band&#x27;s first concert, in Malmö. Susceptible to blood clotting, he was flown back to the US. On March 1, 1974, he died from cirrhosis, at the age of 38, at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in New York. He had been in hospital for a month. He was buried in Philadelphia, and was survived by his wife, Estelle, and son, also Bobby.

==Playing style and influence==
Timmons was known for using block chords, &quot;a style in which the right hand creates the melody and the left hand moves with the rhythm of the right hand, but does not change voicing except to accommodate the chord changes.&quot; His use of them was more aggressive, and less melodic, than that of Red Garland. &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot; suggested that &quot;Timmons&#x27; characteristic style was a rolling, gospelly funk, perhaps longer on sheer energy than on harmonic sophistication.&quot; In the opinion of Scott Yanow, stylistically, &quot;somehow Bobby Timmons never grew beyond where he was in 1960.&quot; Gary Giddins, however, highlighted other facets of Timmons&#x27; playing: the &quot;lush [Bud] Powell-inspired ballads, his clear, sharp, unsentimental long lines.&quot; Carter also identified Powell as a primary influence on Timmons, and commented that his partner in the trio &quot;was very giving, very loyal, played every night like it was his last chance to get it right.&quot;

The funky aspects of Timmons&#x27; playing influenced fellow pianists, including Les McCann, Ramsey Lewis, and Benny Green. Timmons is often mentioned as being under-rated; jazz writer Marc Myers commented in 2008 that &quot;today, Timmons&#x27; contribution to jazz – as an accompanist, writer, leader and innovator of a new sound – is vastly overlooked and undervalued.&quot;

==Compositions==
Timmons wrote &quot;a steady stream of infectious funky tunes&quot;, stated Giddins. Timmons dismissed the idea that he was deliberately a composer: &quot;I&#x27;m a dilettante as a composer. I have never consciously sat down and tried to write a song.&quot; He suggested that his method of composing a new song might involve &quot;whistling, playing around with the notes, or at a club. I&#x27;ll tell one musician to play this note, another that note, and we kick it around.&quot; One account of the creation of &quot;Moanin was given by Golson: Timmons had the opening eight bars, which he often played between tunes, but formed the complete song only after Golson encouraged him to add a bridge.

==Personality==
Tootie Heath reported that, when they were on tour and Timmons was addicted to heroin, Timmons would routinely lie and sometimes pull out a knife to threaten people. On the other hand, Ron Carter, the bassist from that tour, asserted that Timmons offered his bandmates a lot of encouragement to experiment and improve from performance to performance, and that he &quot;was a really multi-talented person and he was just a real sweetheart, a sweetheart of a man&quot;. In Golson&#x27;s words, Timmons &quot;had no ego about him, [...] He was always upbeat, never downbeat, and he never maligned anybody unless it was in a humorous way&quot;.

<text>Noise shaping is a technique typically used in digital audio, image, and video processing, usually in combination with dithering, as part of the process of quantization or bit-depth reduction of a signal. Its purpose is to increase the apparent signal-to-noise ratio of the resultant signal. It does this by altering the spectral shape of the error that is introduced by dithering and quantization; such that the noise power is at a lower level in frequency bands at which noise is considered to be less desirable and at a correspondingly higher level in bands where it is considered to be more desirable. A popular noise shaping algorithm used in image processing is known as ‘Floyd Steinberg dithering’; and many noise shaping algorithms used in audio processing are based on an ‘Absolute threshold of hearing’ model.

== Operation ==

Any feedback loop functions as a filter. Noise shaping works by putting quantization noise in a feedback loop designed to filter the noise as desired.

=== Low-pass boxcar filter example ===
For example, consider the feedback system:

: formula_1

where is a constant, is the cycle number, is the input sample value, is the value being quantized, and is its quantization error:

: formula_2

In this model, when any sample&#x27;s bit depth is reduced, the quantization error is measured and on the next cycle added with the next sample prior to quantization. The effect is that the quantization error is low-pass filtered by a 2-sample boxcar filter (also known as a simple moving average filter). As a result, compared to before, the quantization error has lower power at higher frequencies and higher power at lower frequencies. The filter&#x27;s cutoff frequency can be adjusted by modifying , the proportion of error from the previous sample that is fed back.

=== Impulse response filters in general ===
More generally, any FIR filter or IIR filter can be used to create a more complex frequency response curve. Such filters can be designed using the weighted least squares method. In the case of digital audio, typically the weighting function used is one divided by the absolute threshold of hearing curve, i.e.

: formula_3

=== Dithering ===
Adding an appropriate amount of dither during quantization prevents determinable errors correlated to the signal. If dither is not used then noise shaping effectively functions merely as distortion shaping — pushing the distortion energy around to different frequency bands, but it is still distortion. If dither is added to the process as

:formula_4

then the quantization error truly becomes noise, and the process indeed yields noise shaping.

== In digital audio ==

Noise shaping in audio is most commonly applied as a bit-reduction scheme. The most basic form of dither is flat, white noise. The ear, however, is less sensitive to certain frequencies than others at low levels (see Equal-loudness contour). By using noise shaping the quantization error can be effectively spread around so that more of it is focused on frequencies that can&#x27;t be heard as well and less of it is focused on frequencies that can. The result is that where the ear is most critical the quantization error can be reduced greatly and where the ears are less sensitive the noise is much greater. This can give a perceived noise reduction of 4 bits compared to straight dither. So although 16-bit samples only have 96 dB of dynamic range across the entire spectrum (see quantization distortion calculations), noise-shaped dithering can however increase the perceived audio dynamic range to 120 dB.

=== Noise shaping and 1-bit converters ===
Since around 1989, 1-bit delta-sigma modulators have been used in analog-to-digital converters. This involves sampling the audio at a very high rate (2.8224 million samples per second, for example) but only using a single bit. Because only 1 bit is used, this converter only has 6.02 dB of dynamic range. The noise floor, however, is spread throughout the entire non-aliased frequency range below the Nyquist frequency of 1.4112 MHz. Noise shaping is used to lower the noise present in the audible range (20 Hz to 20 kHz) and increase the noise above the audible range. This results in a broadband dynamic range of only 7.78 dB, but it is not consistent among frequency bands, and in the lowest frequencies (the audible range) the dynamic range is much greater — over 100 dB. Noise shaping is inherently built into the delta-sigma modulators.

The 1-bit converter is the basis of the DSD format by Sony. One criticism of the 1-bit converter (and thus the DSD system) is that because only 1 bit is used in both the signal and the feedback loop, adequate amounts of dither cannot be used in the feedback loop and distortion can be heard under some conditions (more discussion at ).

Most A/D converters made since 2000 use multi-bit or multi-level delta-sigma modulators that yield more than 1 bit output so that proper dither can be added in the feedback loop. For traditional PCM sampling the signal is then decimated to 44.1 kHz or other appropriate sample rates.

=== In modern ADCs ===

Analog Devices uses what they refer to as &quot;Noise Shaping Requantizer&quot;, and Texas Instruments uses what they refer to as &quot;SNRBoost&quot; to lower the noise floor approximately 30db compared to the surrounding frequencies. This comes at a cost of non-continuous operation but produces a nice bathtub shape to the spectrum floor. This can be combined with other techniques such as Bit-Boost to further enhance the resolution of the spectrum.

<doc id="1244254" wikidata="Q1740353" url="?curid=1244254" title="Keystone Aircraft">
<text>Keystone Aircraft Corporation was an early American airplane manufacturer.

== History ==
Headquartered in Bristol, Pennsylvania, the company was formed as &quot;Ogdensburg Aeroway Corp&quot; in 1920 by Thomas Huff and Elliot Daland, but its name was quickly changed to &quot;Huff-Daland Aero Corp&quot;, then to &quot;Huff-Daland Aero Company&quot;. The company made a name for itself in agricultural aircraft, and then in the United States Army Air Corps&#x27; early bomber aircraft. From 1924, James McDonnell was the chief designer.

In 1926, Huff left the company, and it was soon purchased by Hayden, Stone &amp; Co., who increased capital to $1 million (United States) and renamed it Keystone. In 1928, it merged with Loening and was known as Keystone–Loening. In 1929, it was taken over by Curtiss-Wright. Also in 1929, the Keystone–Loening plant on the East River in New York City was closed by Curtiss-Wright and the operation was moved to the Bristol, Pennsylvania. Keystone plant. A small band of the top Loening management, design and shop workers (all New Yorkers) did not want to go to Bristol. They instead started their own aircraft company in a small rented shop in Baldwin, NY in Jan. 1930. The principal players were Leroy R. Grumman, Leon &quot;Jake&quot; Swirbul and William Schwendler. Grumman Aircraft went on to stellar heights with some of the best aircraft in US Navy history. Grumman also designed and built the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) that landed US astronauts on the Moon.

In 1932 the Army Air Corps issued a Circular design proposal for an advanced new heavy bomber which Ford, Martin, Boeing, Fokker, Douglas and Keystone submitted designs. The Keystone entry was for an all metal low winged monoplane bomber with retractable landing gear. The bomber would be powered by two Curtiss V-1570 geared Conqueror engines. With a crew of 5 it was armed with up to 3 x .30 caliber machine guns and could carry 2,000 lbs (907 kg) of bombs on external racks. A mock-up of the aircraft was inspected by the Air Corps in April and was withdrawn by Keystone after it was determined it could not meet the requirements. The contract was ultimately won by Martin for their Model 139, known as the B-10 Bomber. This was to be the last design submitted to the military by Keystone.

Keystone itself became a manufacturing division of Curtiss-Wright and ceased production in 1932. The former Keystone plant was purchased by Fleetwings in 1934.

Lieut. Comdr. Noel Davis and Lieut. Stanton H. Wooster were killed in their Keystone Pathfinder &quot;American Legion&quot; while conducting a test flight, just days before they were to attempt a trans-Atlantic flight for the Orteig Prize.

<doc id="1244261" wikidata="Q6414157" url="?curid=1244261" title="Kino Lorber">
<text>Kino Lorber is an international film distribution company based in New York City. Founded in 1977, it was originally known as Kino International until it was acquired by and merged into Lorber HT Digital in 2009. It specializes in art house films, such as documentary films, classic and rarely seen films from earlier periods in the history of cinema, and world cinema. In addition to theatrical distribution, Kino Lorber releases films in the home entertainment market and has its own streaming services for its digital library.

== History ==
=== 1976–2008; Founding as Kino International ===
Kino Lorber was founded as Kino International in 1976 by Bill Pence, then vice president of Janus Films, and based in Colorado. It began by importing and releasing international films that may have not otherwise reached the market in the United States. The first films distributed by Kino were in association with Janus Films.

In 1977, Kino International was purchased by Donald Krim who at the time worked for United Artists as the head of the nontheatrical department. At this time, the company acquired rights to distribute theatrically films in the Janus Films library, which became the foundation for its international library of films. One of the first films imported under Krim was &quot;Ballad of Orin&quot;.

Kino International was responsible for the theatrical release of films by Charlie Chaplin beginning in 1977. The Chaplin films became the foundation of a silent film collection for Kino International including the 1927 sci-fi film &quot;Metropolis&quot;. 

By 1989, American classics accounted for 80 percent of the company&#x27;s distributions, with the other 20 percent made up of international films.

=== Since 2009; Merger with Lorber HT Digital ===
In 2009, Kino International was acquired by Lorber HT Digital to form Kino Lorber.

Kino Lorber launched its &quot;Kino Lorber Studio Classics&quot; line of films in 2014. Its licensing deal with MGM allowed them access to MGM&#x27;s library of remastered and high-definition films. It released approximately 40 films by the end of 2014, including the Billy Wilder films &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; and &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. 

In 2017, Kino Lorber entered into a partnership with Zeitgeist Films to co-acquire films for theatrical release and taking over home entertainment distribution of their library.

In 2019, Kino Lorber launched a digital streaming service known as &quot;Kino Now.&quot; Described as an &quot;arthouse iTunes,&quot; it allows the purchase and rentals of films in its distribution library. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic lock-downs in 2020, Kino Lorber launched an online distribution service to stream new films in partnership with closed theaters. Known as &quot;Kino Marquee,&quot; the service was seen as a way to help closed theaters generate revenue during the pandemic, splitting revenue equally with participating cinemas. 

In 2021, Kino Lorber launched &quot;Kino Cult,&quot; a free ad-supported streaming channel for genre films. It also entered into a distribution and acquisition agreement with Milestone Films, a New York–based film company known for restoring and distribution of American classic films.

On August 29, 2023, Kino Lorber announced via email that &quot;Kino Cult&quot; was being replaced by &quot;The Midnight Picture Show,&quot; &quot;a new free streaming service featuring more movies from the deliciously dark and devilishly bizarre side of cinema.&quot;

== Business model ==
Kino Lorber has historically been known as a distributor of American classics and international films. When founded in 1977, American classics was 100 percent of its distribution, moving to 80/20 with international films by 1989.

<text>The Fairmont Royal York, formerly and still commonly known as the Royal York, is a large historic luxury hotel in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Located along Front Street West, the hotel is situated at the southern end of the Financial District, in Downtown Toronto. The Royal York was designed by Ross and Macdonald, in association with Sproatt and Rolph, and built by the Canadian Pacific Railway company. The hotel is currently managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts.

Opened on 11 June 1929, the Châteauesque-styled building is tall, and contains 28 floors. It is considered one of Canada&#x27;s grand railway hotels. After its completion, the building was briefly the tallest building in Toronto, as well as the tallest building in the country, and the British Empire, until the nearby Canadian Bank of Commerce Tower was built the following year. The building has undergone several extensive renovations since it first opened, with its first major renovation in 1972. An underground walkway linking the hotel with the Royal Bank Plaza and Union Station form part of Toronto&#x27;s PATH underground city system.

==Location==
The Royal York Hotel sits at 100 Front Street West at the southern end of the Financial District, a business district in Downtown Toronto. The hotel property is bounded by Piper Street to the north, and York Street to the west, whereas its eastern portion is bounded by Royal Bank Plaza, an office complex that serves as the operational headquarters of the Royal Bank of Canada. Union Station, the city&#x27;s main intermodal transportation hub, is located south of the hotel, across Front Street West. The Royal York was not the first hotel built on the site. The first hotel was built in 1843 and was originally known as the Ontario Terrace. It consisted of four brick houses and was later occupied by Knox College, a seminary. The former hotel was later demolished to make way for the Royal York.

Located at the southern end of the Financial District, near Bay Street, the hotel is situated within Canada&#x27;s financial centre. Its southerly location within the Financial District also places the hotel near several downtown neighbourhoods. Southwest of the Financial District is the Entertainment District, whereas the neighbourhoods of St. Lawrence and South Core are located to the east, and south of the Financial District.

The hotel building forms a part of the Union Station Heritage Conservation District, a historic district surrounding Union Station. The creation of the historic district was through 
the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot;, and was enacted by Toronto City Council in July 2006. Given its overlap with the Financial District, the historic district is an eclectic collection of buildings, with structures dating from the 1850s to the present day. Historic buildings within this district include the Dominion Public Building, and The Toronto Club.

===Architecture===
Shortly after acquiring the property, Canadian Pacific Hotels, a division of the Canadian Pacific Railway, announced its plan to demolish the Queen&#x27;s Hotel to construct a new hotel. The building was designed by a Canadian architectural firm, Ross and Macdonald, in association with Sproatt and Rolph. Both firms had designed buildings for Canadian Pacific Hotels before the Royal York Hotel.

The building design went through several drafts before its final draft, &quot;H plan,&quot; was adopted. The plan saw the development of a towering central element, to distinguish itself from the buildings of the nearby Eaton&#x27;s Annex. The building&#x27;s towering design also enabled most rooms and public spaces to face either the downtown core of the city or the Toronto waterfront and Lake Ontario. Completed in 1929, the Châteauesque-styled hotel includes a row of pointed arches on the third story and a small peaked roof with tiny dormers at the top of the pitched roof. In addition, grotesques shaped as griffins are present at various corners of the hotel. The building&#x27;s exterior is made of Indiana Limestone, which encases the hotel&#x27;s 28-story steel frame.

Along with traditional features found in most Chateauesque-styled hotels, the building also incorporated an Art Deco setback and Romanesque-inspired decor. The balanced design of the building (before the addition of the east wing) was achieved through the application of semi-neoclassical motifs, and groups of arcaded windows. The interior of the building was largely created in an Edwardian architectural style. Its interior features a number of crystal chandeliers, and a hand-carved wood lobby ceiling.

The building stands , containing 28 floors primarily made up of guest rooms and other hotel amenities. After the building&#x27;s completion, it was briefly the tallest building in the British Empire, and Canada. The building would lose the record the following year, with the erection of the nearby Canadian Bank of Commerce Tower on King Street.

Work to enlarge the hotel commenced in 1957, and was completed in 1959. The new east wing expansion was designed by the architecture firm Ross, Patterson, Townsend, &amp; Fish, in association with Charles B. Dolphin.

===Facilities===

When the Royal York first opened, the hotel included 1,048 guest rooms and suites. When the hotel first opened, it featured a telephone switchboard longer than . As of 2014, the hotel expanded the number of its guest rooms and suites to 1,363. Types of guest rooms include Signature or Luxury, along with an array of eight types of suites.

In addition to lodgings, the hotel has several event spaces. The hotel features an entire floor of function rooms, primarily used for conferences. A notable room at the hotel includes the Ballroom, which features an oil-painted ceiling from the hotel&#x27;s opening. The Concert Hall is another event space at the hotel that is outfitted with a Casavant Frères pipe organ. With five manuals and one-hundred-and-seven stops, it was the largest pipe organ in Canada. Another notable event space within the hotel is the Imperial Room, which was once used as a nightclub from the 1940s to the 1990s. The space featured a stage at the north end of the room, a sunken floor with tables and a dance floor in the middle, and raised booths at the other end of the room. The room is presently used as a meeting and event space, most often by the Empire Club of Canada. 

A number of rooms at the Royal York are also occupied by restaurants and other food-based services. The Royal York&#x27;s kitchen was Canada&#x27;s largest hotel kitchen when the Royal York first opened, capable of producing over 15,000 French bread rolls a day. Restaurants located within the hotel include &quot;Benihana Japanese Steakhouse&quot;, and the &quot;Library Bar&quot;, the latter also offering afternoon tea. The fourteenth floor of the Royal York houses the hotel&#x27;s roof herb garden, which provides the hotel&#x27;s restaurants with fresh honey, herbs, vegetable, and flowers. The roof garden was opened at the hotel on 12 June 1929. In June 2008, the hotel installed three beehives on its fourteenth floor to serve as an in-house garden for its restaurants. The apiary presently has six beehives, and a pollinator bee hotel, installed in 2014. Approximately 350,000 honey bees reside at the apiary during the summer, with the six beehives producing of honey a year.

The hotel also operates a health club, which offers a number of amenities including an indoor pool with a skylight, a fitness centre, a whirlpool, a sauna, and steam rooms.

In 1929, a tunnel was built under Front Street West, in order to provide guests of the hotel with direct access to Union Station. The tunnel connecting the hotel to Union Station was later connected with the larger PATH underground city, a series of tunnels that connects various buildings in Downtown Toronto. In 1987, the city adopted the role of the coordinating agency for the tunnel network.

== History ==
The Royal York Hotel was not the first hotel built on the property, with the first hotel being built in 1843, known originally as the Ontario Terrace. After the original hotel was refurbished in 1853, the building was renamed the Sword&#x27;s Hotel, and then the Revere Hotel after a change in ownership in 1860. Thomas Dick bought the hotel back in 1862, renovated it again, and named it Queen&#x27;s Hotel. In 1874, the Queen&#x27;s Hotel was purchased by Thomas McGaw and Henry Winnett, hoteliers of Upper Canada, who also owned the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hotel in Niagara on the Lake, but when McGaw died, Winnett purchased the partnership from his estate in 1919 and in 1920 formed a limited liability company of which he was president, also later acquiring McGaw&#x27;s interests in their hotels. The Queen&#x27;s Hotel was billed as &quot;One of the largest and most comfortable hotels in the Dominion of Canada.&quot;

After Winnett&#x27;s death in 1925, his estate sold the Queen&#x27;s Hotel to the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), run by then-president Sir Edward Wentworth Beatty. Later, Canadian Pacific announced its intention to demolish the Queen&#x27;s Hotel to build the largest hotel in the British Commonwealth on its site.

Construction on the new hotel began in 1927 and was completed in 1929. Named the Royal York, the new hotel cost $16 million when built. The completed hotel featured over 1,000 guest rooms, each equipped with radios, private showers, and bathtubs, a library, a 12-bed hospital, and a telephone switchboard. The hotel also operated St. George&#x27;s Golf and Country Club as the Royal York Golf Club from 1930 to 1946, when the hotel&#x27;s parent company, Canadian Pacific Railway, divested itself from the golf course property.

The building was officially opened on 11 June 1929 by the Viscount Willingdon, the Governor General of Canada, in &quot;one of the most glittering social events in Toronto&#x27;s history.&quot; The Toronto Board of Trade hosted a luncheon in the hotel&#x27;s banquet hall for E.W. Beatty and the board of directors of the Canadian Pacific Railway. After the luncheon, the Governor-General registered as the first guest of the hotel. During the afternoon, guides showed guests around the hotel. The day finished off with an opening ball at 9 PM (with over 2300 people attending ). Several politicians and other notable people from the US and Canada attended the opening of the hotel. The opening of the hotel was front-page news in the Montreal Gazette on 12 June 1929. The hotel had of Canadian linoleum flooring upon opening.

From 1930 to 1935, a radio station operated from the hotel. Its call letters were CPRY (for &quot;Canadian Pacific Royal York&quot;). Broadcasting from the Imperial Room, CPRY programs were heard across the country. On 7 September 1949, the lobby of the hotel was converted into a temporary field hospital following a fire on the cruise ship SS &quot;Noronic&quot;. Docked in the Toronto harbour, the disaster on the &quot;Noronic&quot; killed 118 people.

From the 1940s to the 1990s, the hotel operated a nightclub known as the Imperial Room. It attracted top musicians and performers to the hotel from the 1940s to the 1990s, including Anne Murray, Buddy Rich, Count Basie, Doug Henning, Duke Ellington, Eartha Kitt, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Marlene Dietrich, Pearl Bailey, Peggy Lee, Rich Little, Tina Turner, Tony Bennett, and Woody Herman. The Imperial Room was also where Jim Carrey made his comedic stage debut. The nightclub was later converted to an event space.

The Royal York became a centre of political controversy during the 1955 Toronto municipal election, when it was revealed that the incumbent mayor, Allan A. Lamport, had spent taxpayers&#x27; money maintaining a private suite at the hotel for private meetings and cocktail parties. Work to enlarge the hotel with a new east wing commenced in 1957 and was completed in 1959.
The hotel underwent an extensive renovation program in 1972 and 1973 to modernize its image. Called the Royal York Revelation, the program was overseen by the architects Webb Zerafa Menkes Housden (who also designed the Royal Bank plaza next to the hotel). The renovation cut a hole in the main-floor lobby for a spiral staircase, covered the marble pillars in the lobby with wood panelling, hung modern wall lamps and a chandelier, and replaced rugs with carpet. The clock standing at the centre of the spiral staircase was donated by the Canadian royal family. From 1988 until 1993, the Royal York underwent a $100-million restoration.

In 2001, the company which owns the hotel, Canadian Pacific Hotels, was reorganized into Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, adopting the name of the American company it had purchased in 1999. As a result of the company&#x27;s re-brand, the Royal York was renamed the &quot;Fairmont Royal York.&quot; In 2007 the Royal York, along with a number of other Fairmont properties, were sold to Ivanhoé Cambridge, although Fairmont continues to manage the hotel. 

The official welcome and reception for the leaders of the 2010 G20 Toronto summit was held at the Royal York Hotel on 26 June 2010. Due to its usage, the hotel was included in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police&#x27;s designated security zones for the G20 summit. The hotel was used as a filming location for &quot;Red&quot; in 2010, standing in for a Chicago venue.

On 28 October 2014, it was announced the hotel&#x27;s ownership was reorganized. In a joint venture, KingSett Capital Inc. and InnVest Real Estate purchased 80 percent of the Royal York property from Ivanhoé Cambridge in 2014. As the venture&#x27;s managing partner KingSett acquired a 60 percent share of the Royal York property, whereas InnVest acquired a 20 percent share of the property. Ivanhoé Cambridge maintained a 20 percent stake in the property&#x27;s ownership. Following the sale of the hotel, its new owners announced a C$50-million renovation of the hotel.

==Notable guests==
Several notable guests have stayed at the Royal York. The hotel frequently serves as a three-to-four-month home for members of the film industry or newcomers to the adjacent financial core. The Royal York is also used as a host hotel for the Toronto International Film Festival, making it a popular residence during the film festival. Celebrity guests who have visited the hotel include Andrew Lloyd Webber, Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen, Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Garner, Justin Bieber, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Susan Sarandon. The hotel keeps records of its guests&#x27; preferences in order to best accommodate them. Employees of the hotel are forbidden from carrying cell phones, tweeting or sharing information on social media about the guests at the hotel.

A number of heads of state, diplomats, and other foreign dignitaries have also stayed at the Royal York. During the 2010 G20 Toronto summit, the hotel housed eleven heads of state and heads of government. Heads of state that have stayed at the hotel include Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France, and Ronald Reagan, the President of the United States. Other foreign dignitaries that have stayed at the Royal York include American Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the 14th Dalai Lama.

===Royal family===
As Ontario does not have a government house, the Royal York was the residence of choice for Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the Canadian royal family when in Toronto. Elizabeth first visited the Royal York Hotel during her 1951 royal tour of the country, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh. The first members of the royal family to visit the hotel were King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, during their 1939 royal tour of Canada. Other members of the royal family that have visited the Royal York include Prince Andrew, Duke of York; Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall; and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.

The Queen usually had an entire floor reserved for her and her entourage, occupying the Royal Suite herself. The floors above and below the Royal Suite are vacated two weeks prior to the Queen&#x27;s arrival and remain that way until her departure. The hotel includes amenities and furnishings reserved exclusively for the royal family, including a private elevator to the Royal Suite. Furniture and hardware reserved for the royal family, including mattresses and toilets, are placed in storage when not in use.

Schränk also translates to &quot;saw&quot;. The name &quot;Schrank&quot; may refer to
* Franz von Paula Schrank (1747–1835), German botanist and entomologist
* John Schrank (1876–1943), failed American assassin
* Peter Schrank (born 1952), cartoonist

Other uses:
* Schrank (shortened form of kleiderschrank), a tall wardrobe-like German chest with double doors. Often used as hope chests, these were constructed so as to partially dismantle for transport to the matrimonial home.

<text>In linguistics, a syntagma is an elementary constituent segment within a text. Such a segment can be a phoneme, a word, a grammatical phrase, a sentence, or an event within a larger narrative structure, depending on the level of analysis. Syntagmatic analysis involves the study of relationships (rules of combination) among syntagmas.

At the lexical level, syntagmatic structure in a language is the combination of words according to the rules of syntax for that language. For example, English uses determiner + adjective + noun, e.g. &quot;the big house&quot;. Another language might use determiner + noun + adjective (Spanish ) and therefore have a different syntagmatic structure.

At a higher level, narrative structures feature a realistic temporal flow guided by tension and relaxation; thus, for example, events or rhetorical figures may be treated as syntagmas of epic structures.

Syntagmatic structure is often contrasted with paradigmatic structure. In semiotics, &quot;syntagmatic analysis&quot; is analysis of syntax or surface structure (syntagmatic structure), rather than paradigms as in paradigmatic analysis. Analysis is often achieved through commutation tests.

<doc id="1244292" wikidata="Q3537757" url="?curid=1244292" title="Electromagnetically induced transparency">
<text>Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is a coherent optical nonlinearity which renders a medium transparent within a narrow spectral range around an absorption line. Extreme dispersion is also created within this transparency &quot;window&quot; which leads to &quot;slow light&quot;, described below. It is in essence a quantum interference effect that permits the propagation of light through an otherwise opaque atomic medium.

Observation of EIT involves two optical fields (highly coherent light sources, such as lasers) which are tuned to interact with three quantum states of a material. The &quot;probe&quot; field is tuned near resonance between two of the states and measures the absorption spectrum of the transition. A much stronger &quot;coupling&quot; field is tuned near resonance at a different transition. If the states are selected properly, the presence of the coupling field will create a spectral &quot;window&quot; of transparency which will be detected by the probe. The coupling laser is sometimes referred to as the &quot;control&quot; or &quot;pump&quot;, the latter in analogy to incoherent optical nonlinearities such as spectral hole burning or saturation.

EIT is based on the destructive interference of the transition probability amplitude between atomic states. Closely related to EIT are coherent population trapping (CPT) phenomena.

The quantum interference in EIT can be exploited to laser cool atomic particles, even down to the quantum mechanical ground state of motion. This was used in 2015 to directly image individual atoms trapped in an optical lattice.

== Medium requirements ==
There are specific restrictions on the configuration of the three states. Two of the three possible transitions between the states must be &quot;dipole allowed&quot;, i.e. the transitions can be induced by an oscillating electric field. The third transition must be &quot;dipole forbidden.&quot; One of the three states is connected to the other two by the two optical fields. The three types of EIT schemes are differentiated by the energy differences between this state and the other two. The schemes are the ladder, vee, and lambda. Any real material system may contain many triplets of states which could theoretically support EIT, but there are several practical limitations on which levels can actually be used.

Also important are the dephasing rates of the individual states. In any real system at non-zero temperature there are processes which cause a scrambling of the phase of the quantum states. In the gas phase, this means usually collisions. In solids, dephasing is due to interaction of the electronic states with the host lattice. The dephasing of state formula_1 is especially important; ideally formula_1 should be a robust, metastable state.

Currently EIT research uses atomic systems in dilute gases, solid solutions, or more exotic states such as Bose–Einstein condensate. EIT has been demonstrated in electromechanical and optomechanical systems, where it is known as optomechanically induced transparency. Work is also being done in semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum wells, quantum wires and quantum dots.

== Theory ==
EIT was first proposed theoretically by professor Jakob Khanin and graduate student Olga Kocharovskaya at Gorky State University (renamed to Nizhny Novgorod in 1990), Russia; there are now several different approaches to a theoretical treatment of EIT. One approach is to extend the density matrix treatment used to drive Rabi oscillation of a two-state, single field system. In this picture the probability amplitude for the system to transfer between states can interfere destructively, preventing absorption. In this context, &quot;interference&quot; refers to interference between &quot;quantum events&quot; (transitions) and not optical interference of any kind. As a specific example, consider the lambda scheme shown above. Absorption of the probe is defined by transition from formula_3 to formula_4. The fields can drive population from formula_3-formula_4 directly or from formula_3-formula_4-formula_1-formula_4. The probability amplitudes for the different paths interfere destructively. If formula_1 has a comparatively long lifetime, then the result will be a transparent window completely inside of the formula_3-formula_4 absorption line.

Another approach is the &quot;dressed state&quot; picture, wherein the system + coupling field Hamiltonian is diagonalized and the effect on the probe is calculated in the new basis. In this picture EIT resembles a combination of Autler-Townes splitting and Fano interference between the dressed states. Between the doublet peaks, in the center of the transparency window, the quantum probability amplitudes for the probe to cause a transition to either state cancel.

A polariton picture is particularly important in describing stopped light schemes. Here, the photons of the probe are coherently &quot;transformed&quot; into &quot;dark state polaritons&quot; which are excitations of the medium. These excitations exist (or can be &quot;stored&quot;) for a length of time dependent only on the dephasing rates.

== Slow light and stopped light==

EIT is only one of many diverse mechanisms which can produce slow light. The Kramers–Kronig relations dictate that a change in absorption (or gain) over a narrow spectral range must be accompanied by a change in refractive index over a similarly narrow region. This rapid and &quot;positive&quot; change in refractive index produces an extremely low group velocity. The first experimental observation of the low group velocity produced by EIT was by Boller, İmamoğlu, and Harris at Stanford University in 1991 in strontium. In 1999 Lene Hau reported slowing light in a medium of ultracold sodium atoms, achieving this by using quantum interference effects responsible for electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Her group performed copious research regarding EIT with Stephen E. Harris. &quot;Using detailed numerical simulations, and analytical theory, we study properties of micro-cavities which incorporate materials that exhibit Electro-magnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) or Ultra Slow Light (USL). We find that such systems, while being miniature in size (order wavelength), and integrable, can have some outstanding properties. In particular, they could have lifetimes orders of magnitude longer than other existing systems, and could exhibit non-linear all-optical switching at single photon power levels. Potential applications include miniature atomic clocks, and all-optical quantum information processing.&quot; The current record for slow light in an EIT medium is held by Budker, Kimball, Rochester, and Yashchuk at U.C. Berkeley in 1999. Group velocities as low as 8 m/s were measured in a warm thermal rubidium vapor.

&quot;Stopped&quot; light, in the context of an EIT medium, refers to the &quot;coherent&quot; transfer of photons to the quantum system and back again. In principle, this involves switching &quot;off&quot; the coupling beam in an adiabatic fashion while the probe pulse is still inside of the EIT medium. There is experimental evidence of trapped pulses in EIT medium. Authors created a stationary light pulse inside the atomic coherent media. In 2009 researchers from Harvard University and MIT demonstrated a few-photon optical switch for quantum optics based on the slow light ideas. Lene Hau and a team from Harvard University were the first to demonstrate stopped light.

== EIT cooling ==

EIT has been used to laser cool long strings of atoms to their motional ground state in an ion trap. To illustrate the cooling technique, consider a three level atom as shown with a ground state formula_14, an excited state formula_15, and a stable or metastable state formula_16 that lies in between them. The excited state formula_15 is dipole coupled to formula_16 and formula_14. An intense &quot;coupling&quot; laser drives the formula_20 transition at detuning formula_21 above resonance. Due to the quantum interference of transition amplitudes, a weaker &quot;cooling&quot; laser driving the formula_22 transition at detuning formula_23 above resonance sees a Fano-like feature on the absorption profile. EIT cooling is realized when formula_24, such that the carrier transition formula_25 lies on the dark resonance of the Fano-like feature, where formula_26 is used to label the quantized motional state of the atom. The Rabi frequency formula_27 of the coupling laser is chosen such that the formula_28 &quot;red&quot; sideband lies on the narrow maximum of the Fano-like feature. Conversely the formula_29 &quot;blue&quot; sideband lies in a region of low excitation probability, as shown in the figure below. Due to the large ratio of the excitation probabilities, the cooling limit is lowered in comparison to doppler or sideband cooling (assuming the same cooling rate).

<doc id="1244298" wikidata="Q583536" url="?curid=1244298" title="¡Mucha Lucha!">
<text>¡Mucha Lucha! (subtitled Gigante during its third and final season) is an American animated television series that aired on the Kids&#x27; WB block on The WB from August 17, 2002, to February 26, 2005. It was created by Eddie Mort and Lili Chin and produced by Warner Bros. Animation. It is the first animated television series intended for children created with Macromedia Flash, a program which became widely used as a medium for animation in the years.

A direct-to-video feature film based on the series, &quot;¡Mucha Lucha!: The Return of El Maléfico&quot;, was released on January 4, 2005.

== Premise ==
The show is set in Luchaville, a fictional town in Southern California centered on &quot;lucha libre&quot; where nearly everyone in that town wears a costume (they are never seen without their mask) and has a well-known wrestling move. These wrestling moves being capable of transforming the character in relation to the naming of the move. The series mainly centers on three friends, Rikochet, Buena Girl, and the Flea, as they struggle through the Foremost World-Renowned International School of Lucha, where they study.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
* Rikochet (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui in seasons 1-2 and Jason Marsden in season 3)– A young wrestler who is the protagonist. He considers himself the bravest of the group, but sometimes leaps before he finds.
* Buena Girl (Kimberly Brooks)– A smart, young female wrestler who always plays by the rules. She can also be very arrogant and obnoxious at times.
* The Flea (voiced by Candi Milo)– A friend of Rikochet and Buena Girl who is always dirty and refers to himself in the third person. As well as having a few disgusting habits, he is also the most nervous but often proves to be a useful ally.
* El Rey (voiced by Michael Donovan)– An action figure which represents Rikochet&#x27;s conscience. He carries him in a backpack, but he can move and talk on his own as if he were alive. It is stated that this action figure is just part of a large merchandising euphoria related to a supreme undefeated Mexican wrestler with the same name (an allusion to Santo). Alongside the series, several other El Rey toys appear and often causes trouble with Rikochet. He always calls Ricochet &quot;Chico&quot; and a disgrace.

==Production==
&quot;¡Mucha Lucha!&quot; ran into a problem when initially pitched to Kids&#x27; WB as they wouldn&#x27;t want actual wrestling seen on screen due to seeming violent. Lili Chin would have to draw visual guides to show that actual wrestling was more choreography than harmful acts of violence.

==Merchandise==
A toy line based on the show was released by Jakks Pacific in 2004. In this toy line included &quot;Mix-a-Lot&quot; action figures; these had removable body parts that could be placed on the bodies of other action figures in the series. &quot;Signature Move&quot; action figures were also put out, along with a toy wrestling ring. However, the second series of the toy line was canceled.

During the summer of 2003, DC Comics published a three-issue mini-series of comic books based on &quot;¡Mucha Lucha!&quot; All three of the stories featured in these comic books were written by Eddie Mort, and have even been occasionally referenced in the TV series.

# El Rey, Come Home!
# It&#x27;s All Buena!
# Limbo of the Lost Luchadores!

The show was licensed for a Game Boy Advance video game, &quot;Mascaritas of the Lost Code&quot;, in late 2003; a PlayStation 2 video game, &quot;Mysterioso Grande&quot;, was slated for release, but was cancelled around 2004 as the creators could not find a publisher.

In the year 2005 the Mexican snack company Sabritas distributed promotional items in the form of tazos with a picture of various characters from the show. Totaling in 230 pogs, they were sold in two separate series. The first series was referred to as the &quot;classic&quot; series, while the second series was referred to as the &quot;rematch&quot; series.

==Proposed revival==
In 2014, a revival called &quot;¡Mucha Lucha! Para Siempre&quot; was proposed which would have centered on Rikochet, Buena Girl, and the Flea as teenagers. Rikochet would return home after time away with his uncle with a sense of purposelessness. Due to losing his honor as a wrestler 5 years ago to another wrestler named Guillermo El Toro. He would he find a new found sense of purpose after hearing from the television that Guillermo El Toro would be fighting Buena Girl. Rikochet would then reconnect with The Flea and Buena girl and have a rematch With Guillermo El Toro to reclaim his honor.

<doc id="1244334" wikidata="Q451927" url="?curid=1244334" title="Flicker fixer">
<text>A flicker fixer or scan doubler is a piece of computer hardware that de-interlaces an output video signal. The flicker fixer accomplishes this by adjusting the timing of the natively interlaced video signal to suit the needs of a progressive display for example a CRT computer monitor. Flicker fixers in essence create a progressive frame of video from two interlaced fields of video.

Flicker fixers sample the NTSC/PAL output from the output device and store each scan line from the field currently being displayed in RAM while simultaneously outputting the line alternately with the corresponding neighboring lines from the field stored previously (&quot;weaving&quot;). Some more advanced flicker fixers integrated in add-on graphics cards use more sophisticated methods. Outputting the image at double scan rate essentially composes a progressive display with all lines from both fields at full vertical refresh rate. This promotes the horizontal frequency of the signal from 15.734 kHz to 31.47 kHz (in the NTSC case, numbers for PAL are slightly lower), which can be the used to drive a VGA monitor from an output device.

== Use with the Amiga ==

One computer capable of producing an interlaced image is the Amiga. The Amiga&#x27;s default video mode is PAL or NTSC. NTSC and PAL interlaced screens have two fields called odd and even. The fields switch every 60th of a second on NTSC, or 50th of a second on PAL, which allows for higher resolution while using a narrower signal bandwidth than full 50 or 60 FPS progressive video would require, but it can also produce an alarming jittering effect for graphics with high contrast details between fields. This NTSC/PAL compatibility gave the Amiga a distinct edge in uses such as television production and gaming, but since the original Amigas were unable to produce vertically high-resolution displays without flickering this was unsuitable for office-like usage where one might need to work with a clear high-resolution image for several hours. Flicker fixers were devised to remedy this.

The later iteration of the Amiga - the Amiga 3000 had a custom chip called Amber which could perform flicker-fixing on any signal. The ECS and AGA chipset could also output VGA display modes. Commodore offered the A2320 Display Enhancer Board for this purpose, The board fit neatly in a video graphics adapter slot on the A2000 series computer. It supported the new video modes offered by the Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) and AmigaOS 2.0, including the Productivity Mode. Also, the earlier A2024 &#x27;Hedley&#x27; greyscale monitor featured an integrated flicker fixer, supporting up to 8 shades of grey.

<text>A Nod&#x27;s as Good as a Wink... To a Blind Horse is the third album by British rock group Faces, and their second album of 1971. Bolstered by lead singer Rod Stewart&#x27;s recent solo success with &quot;Maggie May&quot;, it was their most successful album worldwide, peaking at No. 6 in the US, and reaching No. 2 in the UK. It also contains their biggest US hit, the swaggering &quot;Stay with Me&quot; (No. 6 in the UK, No. 17 in the US), and the album itself would be certified gold by the RIAA in 1972.

The album features two original ballads and a cover of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Memphis Tennessee&quot;. Bassist Ronnie Lane, usually confined to backing vocals and the occasional sole lead vocal on previous Faces records, sings lead on three of his own compositions here (one co-written with keyboardist Ian McLagan). Of these, &quot;Debris&quot;, an elliptical examination of father-son relationships, was chosen as the B-side to their hit &quot;Stay With Me&quot;. (Lane&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re So Rude&quot; served as the B-side of the American release.)

== Release and reception ==
The original issue of the album came with a large poster. The poster included the lyrics for the album, as well as close-up images of pills and pharmaceutical capsules, and polaroid photos (apparently taken on tour) of band and crew members reveling with naked groupies in hotel rooms. Within weeks of release, the record company re-issued the album without the poster, turning original copies with the poster into collectors&#x27; items overnight.

On 28 August 2015, the album was reissued in a remastered and expanded form, with the bonus tracks being two songs from a previously unreleased BBC session. The new vinyl reissue even replicated the poster included with the first-pressing vinyl release.

=== Reception ===
The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Rebecca Jenkins (born 1959) is a Canadian actress and singer.

==Acting==
She had starring roles in the 1990s CBC series &quot;Black Harbour&quot;, and the films &quot;Bye Bye Blues&quot;, &quot;Marion Bridge&quot;, &quot;Wilby Wonderful&quot;, &quot;Whole New Thing&quot;, &quot;South of Wawa&quot; and &quot;Supervolcano&quot;. She also had a supporting role in the 1992 film &quot;Bob Roberts&quot;, as Dolores Perrigrew. In NBC&#x27;s miniseries &quot;10.5&quot; she portrayed California governor Carla Williams.

Jenkins appeared in the January 17, 2006, episode of the WB series &quot;Supernatural&quot;, where she played the loving wife to a faith healer. Her next project was a television movie entitled &quot;Past Sins&quot; directed by David Winning, in which she co-starred with Lauralee Bell. &quot;Past Sins&quot; aired on Lifetime in November, 2006.

In 2012, she appeared in Sarah Polley&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Stories We Tell&quot;, playing Polley&#x27;s mother Diane in dramatic recreations.

==Music==
As a singer, Jenkins has primarily been a backing vocalist for Jane Siberry and The Parachute Club. Early in her career, she provided the voicings of the mermaids in the 1987 film &quot;I&#x27;ve Heard the Mermaids Singing&quot;. She has also recorded tracks for a number of Canadian benefit and compilation albums, and participated in the &quot;Count Your Blessings&quot; concert with Siberry, Holly Cole, Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara and Victoria Williams. As well, Jenkins is featured prominently on the &quot;Bye Bye Blues&quot; soundtrack album; her character in the film is a woman who takes up jazz singing to support her family while her husband is away during World War II. She also performed the title track &quot;Bye Bye Blues&quot; in Calgary at the September 1, 2005, opening the night of the celebration of Alberta&#x27;s centennial.

In 2007, she was scheduled to release her first solo album, a collection of jazz standards. Her husband, Joel Bakan, a jazz guitarist, accompanied her as well as Al Matheson on trumpet and Liam Macdonald on drums and percussion. 

She cohosted a five-week radio series called &quot;Quiet, There&#x27;s a Lady on Stage&quot; with singer-songwriter David Ramsden. The radio show was recorded with four new female singers weekly in the CBC&#x27;s Glenn Gould Studio. Guests included Carole Pope, Holly Cole, Lee Whalen, Lori Yates, Molly Johnson, Kate Fenner and Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara.

She married Joel Bakan, the writer of the book and documentary film &quot;The Corporation&quot;, in July 2004.

<text>The proton pack is a fictional energy-based capture device, used for controlling and lassoing ghosts in the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; universe. First depicted in the film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, it has a hand-held wand (&quot;Neutrona Wand&quot; or particle thrower) connected to a backpack-sized nuclear accelerator. It controls a stream of highly focused and radially polarized protons that electrostatically controls the negatively charged energy of a ghost, allowing it to be held in the stream.

==In the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; universe==

The proton pack, designed and built by Dr. Egon Spengler, is a man-portable cyclotron system (and indeed Dr. Peter Venkman refers to the proton packs in one scene as &quot;unlicensed nuclear accelerators&quot;), that is used to create a charged particle beam—composed of protons—that is fired by the particle thrower (also referred to as the &quot;neutrona wand&quot;). Described in the first movie as a &quot;positron collider&quot;, it functions by colliding high-energy positrons to generate its proton beam. The beam allows a Ghostbuster to contain and hold &quot;negatively charged ectoplasmic entities&quot;. This containment ability allows the wielder to position a ghost above a trap for capture. The stream is also quite destructive to physical objects, and can cause extensive property damage.

The name &quot;proton pack&quot; is not used in the original movie at all, and is not used until the subway tunnel scene in &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, when Egon says that they should get their proton packs. The doorman to the Mayor&#x27;s mansion also uses the term &quot;proton pack&quot;, asking the Ghostbusters if he can buy one from them for his little brother. Egon replies that &quot;A proton pack is not a toy&quot;.

In the 1984 novelization of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, the Proton Packs are mentioned, eg. “Stantz hauls out the formidable weaponry from the back of the Ectomobile and the four men kit themselves up, buckling on their proton packs…”

In the , Ray explains how the proton pack works early in the game; the energy emitted by the proton stream helps to dissipate psychokinetic (PK) energy which ghosts use to manifest themselves. Draining them of their PK energy weakens them, allowing them to be captured in their portable ghost traps.

According to a line spoken by Egon in &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, each pack&#x27;s energy cell has a half-life of 5,000 years. Knobs on the main stock of the proton pack can perform various functions to customize the proton stream, including adjustments for stream intensity, length, and degrees of polarization. In the cartoon series &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, the maximum power setting for the proton packs is &quot;500,000 MHz,&quot; which possibly refers to the rate of positron collisions occurring within the pack&#x27;s accelerator system. In the cartoon the packs also have a self-destruct mechanism capable of affecting at least a half-mile radius. &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; also made proton packs less efficient with power cells, allowing them to run out of energy when appropriate for dramatic tension.

For the 1997 animated spinoff &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot;, the proton packs and ghost traps are redesigned to combat the threat of the malevolent Achira, an ancient disease-provoking entity accidentally released by workers constructing a new subway tunnel. Egon, with the help of Roland, Kylie and Eduardo, increased the proton packs&#x27; nuclear capability (to deal with Achira and other subsequent enemies, much stronger than what the original Ghostbusters had faced) and modified the power system; now, the packs required replaceable proton canisters to be loaded in for them to function. The trap was redesigned as well, into a gold-colored, round-shaped device with an opening hatch atop it. Kylie would typically carry it; due to this, she did not carry a normal proton pack, instead carrying a not-as-powerful proton pistol.

The IDW monthly &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; comic storyline has shown the movie pack, a boson dart capable pack and the Extreme Ghostbusters pack in use. The IDW comic also shows a proton pistol attachment to the movie pack being used by Winston while hunting down Slimer.

===Crossing the streams===
Crossing the streams was initially discouraged, as Egon believed that &quot;total protonic reversal&quot; would occur: this effect would have catastrophic results (see quote above) if they are crossed over three seconds. However, in a desperate effort to stop the powerful Gozer the Gozerian, Egon noted that the door to Gozer&#x27;s temple &quot;swings both ways&quot; and that by crossing the streams, they may be able to create enough force to close the door on Gozer and its control. As the Ghostbusters cross the streams, the combination of that much energy closes the door to Gozer&#x27;s dimension and severs its ties to our world. The resulting blast destroys a good portion of the roof and blows up the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

In &quot;&quot;, the Ghostbusters mention that &quot;crossing the streams&quot; during the Gozer Incident (events of the first &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; film) only worked due to the presence of a cross-dimension portal (a tactic which is referred to as the &quot;Gozer gambit&quot; by Ray) and should only be used as a last resort. During the game&#x27;s climax, the Ghostbusters are pulled into Ivo Shandor&#x27;s ghostly realm and come face-to-face with Shandor&#x27;s Destructor form, forcing them to resort to &quot;crossing the streams&quot; to defeat Shandor. The resulting blast not only destroys Shandor but also sends the team flying back to their dimension. During gameplay, it is possible for the player to cross the streams with another Ghostbuster, but this will only cause a burst of energy to travel down the stream and deal a massive amount of damage to the player, while also knocking them off their feet for a short time, due to a new &quot;safety&quot; that was installed on the neutrona wand.

In the extended version of the reboot film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (2016), shows that its iteration of the Ghostbusters (Abby Yates, Erin Gilbert, Jillian Holtzman, and Patty Tolan) had initially tried to close Rowan North&#x27;s portal with their crossed streams before resorting to use their Ecto-1&#x27;s reactor to detonate an explosion to create the total protonic reversal powerful enough to seal it.

In &quot;&quot;, Egon built proton cannons with the parts of the proton packs and a PKE meter in Summerville, Oklahoma, to keep Gozer&#x27;s portal closed with safely fired crossed streams. Later, the Ghostbusters again crossing their proton streams against Gozer to counter its energy-based powers and to weaken its physical form, allowing them to capture the deity in their 198 ghost traps.

==In &quot;Ghostbusters: The Video Game&quot;==
The game features a modified version of the proton pack (an experimental prototype) which is given to the player (the Ghostbuster&#x27;s new &quot;experimental equipment technician&quot;/guinea pig) for field testing. This new proton pack is equipped with other features (and upgrades) besides the standard proton stream.

==As props in the real world==
The props representing proton packs were originally thought to have been made by the prop department of Columbia Pictures. Information released during the auction of a hero prop proton pack from the first film in July 2012 revealed that the hero proton packs could have been made by Boss Film Studios, a prop studio started by ILM veteran Richard Edlund.

The hero prop packs were made of molded fiberglass shells on aluminium backplates (or &quot;motherboards&quot;) bolted to military surplus ALICE frames. The basic shape was sculpted from foam; later, a rubber mold was made of it, from which fiberglass shells were made. The electronics were quite advanced for the time. The packs have a lightbar with 15 blue scrolling lights in a box on the left-hand side and 4 red lights in the circular &quot;cyclotron&quot; portion of the bottom of the prop that light up in rotation. The &quot;wand&quot; also featured numerous light features; the most elaborate versions had fluorescent bargraphs, incandescent bulbs, and strobing flashes in the tip for the visual effects crew to synchronize the &#x27;streams&#x27; to. They were then finished with various surplus 1960s resistors, pneumatic fittings, hoses, ribbon cable, and surplus warning labels and custom-made metal fittings, including an extending barrel mechanism. The overall weight of these props is said to be around . 

The proton packs used in stunt scenes were lightweight foam rubber versions made from the same mould that lacked the electronics of the hero props.

Some packs from &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; were used in the follow-up &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;. These packs were slightly redressed, and the angle of the gun, or &quot;wand&quot; mount was changed to pitch forward slightly, in order to make the prop easier for the actor to use. In addition to these redressed props, one of the originals was used to make a new mold to produce lighter-weight &quot;mid-grade&quot; props as a solution to complaints by the actors about the weight of the original prop. These mid-grade pieces featured many details cast in as part of the mold, instead of separate fittings. The electronics and mechanisms were also cut down greatly, reducing the total weight. The original &quot;GB1&quot; props would appear in close-ups, the mid-grade in other scenes, and new rubber &quot;stunt&quot; packs were made for whenever the actor needed to take a fall.

The proton pack props from the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; movies are some of the most wanted and collectible props ever made. Several &quot;GB2&quot; packs have surfaced for auction. In September 2004, one rubber stunt and one fiberglass midgrade prop were auctioned by Profiles in History. The midgrade prop fetched well over $13,000.

All three variations of the &quot;GB2&quot; pack have been displayed at various Planet Hollywood restaurants around the U.S.

Toy proton packs were formerly made by Kenner as part of the &quot;Real Ghostbusters&quot; toy line. They consisted of a plastic hollow pack and gun, with a yellow foam cylinder attached to the front of the gun to represent the beam.

In late 2021, Hasbro announced a 1:1 scale replica of Spengler&#x27;s Proton Pack as a Haslab crowdfunding campaign, with preorders opening in late October 2021. The project was successfully backed by the deadline and was put into production, with the first shipping in January 2023.

<text>A Christmas stamp is a postage stamp with a Christmas theme, intended for use on seasonal mail such as Christmas cards. Many countries issue such stamps, which are regular postage stamps (in contrast to Christmas seals) and are usually valid for postage year-round (in some countries they have a discounted value and are for use exclusively on Christmas cards). They usually go on sale some time between early October and early December, and are printed in considerable quantities.

==History==


It is a matter of some debate as to which was the first Christmas stamp. The Canadian map stamp of 1898 bears an inscription &quot;XMAS 1898&quot;, but it was actually issued to mark the inauguration of the Imperial Penny Postage rate. The Christmas connection has long been reported to have been the result of quick thinking; William Mulock was proposing that it be issued on 9 November, to &quot;honor the Prince&quot; (meaning the Prince of Wales), but when Queen Victoria asked &quot;what Prince?&quot; in a displeased manner, Mulock realized the danger, and answered &quot;Why, madam, the Prince of Peace.&quot;

In 1935, British Forces troops stationed in Egypt were issued with a Christmas stamp for their mail home. For many years these were not included in the Stanley Gibbons catalogues, as they classified them as a “seal” rather than a postage stamp, but they have been properly included since the mid-1960s as they prepaid postage and so, despite the inscription &quot;Letter stamp&quot;, are normal stamps, and should therefore be counted as the first stamp issued expressly to mark Christmas. Like the slightly earlier Silver Jubilee overprints on the “sphinx” stamp, the Christmas stamps were issued in booklet form in panes of 20.

In 1937, Austria issued two &quot;Christmas greeting stamps&quot; featuring a rose and zodiac signs. In 1939, Brazil issued four semi-postal stamps with designs featuring the three kings and a star, an angel and child, the Southern Cross and a child, and a mother and child. In 1941 Hungary also issued a semi-postal whose additional fees were to pay for &quot;soldiers&#x27; Christmas&quot;. The first stamps to depict the Nativity were the Hungary issue of 1943. These were all one-time issues, more like commemorative stamps than regular issues.

The next Christmas stamps did not appear until 1951, when Cuba issued designs with poinsettias and bells, followed by Haiti in 1954, Luxembourg and Spain in 1955, and Australia, South Korea, and Liechtenstein in 1957. In cases such as Australia, the issuance marked the first of what became an annual tradition. Many additional countries took up the practice during the 1960s, including the United States in 1962 and the United Kingdom in 1966.

By the 1990s, approximately 160 postal administrations were issuing Christmas stamps, mostly on an annual basis. Islamic countries constitute the largest group of non-participants, although the Palestinian Authority has issued Christmas stamps since 1995.

==Designs==
Although some tropical islands produce large-format Christmas stamps primarily intended for sale to stamp collectors, for the rest of the world, Christmas stamps are &quot;working stamps&quot; that will be used in large numbers to send greeting cards and postcards. Accordingly, the stamps tend to be normal-sized, and offered in one or a few denominations, for instance to cover differing domestic and international rates.

The choice of designs is highly variable, ranging from an overtly religious image of the Nativity, to secular images of Christmas trees, wreaths, Santa Claus, and so forth. A country may maintain a unified theme for several years, then change it drastically, in some cases seemingly to follow &quot;fashion moves&quot; by other countries. For instance, during the 1970s many countries issued Christmas stamps featuring children&#x27;s drawings, with the young artist identified by name and age.

The choice of secular or religious designs is frequently a bone of contention in some countries; church leaders often see secular designs as diluting the meaning of the holiday, while postal officials fear that overly religious designs could lead their secular or minority-religious customers to avoid the stamps, leaving millions unsold, and even expose the postal administration to charges that they are violating laws prohibiting the promotion of a particular religion.

In the United States, annual discord over &quot;secular&quot; versus &quot;religious&quot; designs was eventually resolved by the Postal Service issuing some of each per year; typically a group of 4–6 related secular designs, plus a religious design (usually depicting the Madonna and Child). To avoid difficulties attendant upon contracting for original designs with a religious theme, the latter have typically been adapted from Old Master paintings hanging in U.S. galleries, thus qualifying as depictions of art. (In 2012, 2014, and 2016, however, religious-themed stamps were issued featuring original designs depicting the flight into Egypt, the journey of the Magi, and the Nativity of Jesus, respectively.) In the United Kingdom, the Royal Mail resolves the difficulty by issuing &quot;religious&quot; and &quot;secular&quot; themed designs in alternate years.

== Gallery ==
==Usage==
The typical usage of Christmas stamps is to quickly apply them to a stack of Christmas cards to go out. In the age of email, Christmas stamps may represent some individuals&#x27; largest remaining use of stamps in a year, and it is not unusual to see &quot;leftovers&quot; appear on regular mail during the first months of the new year. In Australia and the Netherlands, Christmas stamps are sold at a discount, but can be used after Christmas with additional stamps to make up the correct rate.

==Collecting==
Christmas is a popular theme for topical collecting. Because of the quantities printed, almost all Christmas stamps are easy to come by and of negligible cost. Collecting challenges would therefore be to get covers with apropos postal markings, such as a postmark on Christmas Day (not all post offices get the day off), from a particular location (such as Christmas Island; Christmas, Florida; Noel, Missouri; North Pole, Alaska; North Pole, New York; or Santa Claus, Indiana), or bearing a specific Christmas theme or slogan.

The Christmas Philatelic Club was formed in 1969 by Christmas stamp collectors and issues a quarterly journal, the &quot;Yule Log&quot;. A number of collectors treat Christmas collecting as a subcategory of religion on stamps.

==Other holiday stamps==

The United States has occasionally issued stamps for other holidays, such as Thanksgiving and New Year&#x27;s Day. Since the 1990s, stamps for Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Eid, and Chinese New Year have become a regular part of the holiday program, although in contrast to Christmas stamps the designs tend to be re-used for several years, distinguishable only by a different denomination or year date.

In Japan, there is a longstanding tradition of a New Year&#x27;s stamp. A number of Easter stamps have also been issued, but these are largely aimed at collectors.

Valentine&#x27;s Day stamps are a more recent tradition in some countries.

<doc id="1244356" wikidata="Q570256" url="?curid=1244356" title="Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC">
<text>Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC is an American professional soccer team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Founded and beginning play in 1999, the club plays in the Eastern Conference of the USL Championship, the second tier of the American soccer pyramid. Since 2013, the Riverhounds have played their home games at the 5,000-seat Highmark Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium located in Station Square. Their current head coach is Bob Lilley. Saint Lucian international David Flavius currently holds the club records for most appearances and goals which he set over his eight seasons with the Riverhounds between 1999 and 2006.

In 2016, the Riverhounds organization announced its intentions to join Major League Soccer by 2023; but have never submitted a formal bid during any of the league&#x27;s rounds of expansion. Highmark Stadium initially seated 3,500 spectators, though the stadium is designed to be capable to 18,500.

==History==
==Colors and badge==
Originally, the Riverhounds&#x27; colors were predominantly red with smaller amounts of black and white. Pittsburgh-based BD&amp;E designed the original logo. The firm made a strategic decision not to make the club&#x27;s colors black and gold. The choice meant the Hounds would not align with the region&#x27;s established professional sports identity but would allow the soccer fans&#x27; jerseys to stand out in a Pittsburgh crowd. The club adopted new colors, predominantly blue with white and black added, before the start of the 2008 season to honor their academy and training partnership with Everton. The use of blue was also an allusion to the blue collar populace of Pittsburgh. Beginning in 2014, the Riverhounds began wearing black and gold uniforms more regularly, aligning the club with the colors representative of Pittsburgh&#x27;s other professional sports teams. Blue and black kits continued to be worn as an alternate third version.

On February 16, 2018, the Riverhounds unveiled a new crest as part of its rebranding. The new crest incorporates traditional Pittsburgh sports colors with important symbols of the city such as bridges and rivers. The crest was designed by Oregon-based graphic designer Brian Gundell.

==Stadium==
Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC has played at Highmark Stadium, a 5,000 seat soccer-specific stadium in Station Square, since 2013. The stadium is owned and operated by the Riverhounds organization.
==Supporters==
In November 2007, the first supporters group of the Pittsburgh Riverhounds was formed, The Steel Army. The Steel Army held their first meeting at Piper&#x27;s Pub in Pittsburgh&#x27;s South Side. The group started as 5–10 local people interested in supporting the reorganized Riverhounds Soccer Club and in supporting the efforts of growing the sport of soccer in Western Pennsylvania as well.

Members are from Pittsburgh and nearby states like Ohio and distant states such as Oregon and Florida. Membership in the Steel Army is also international. Members have joined from Portsmouth, Sunderland, Surrey and Derbyshire in the U.K., Bray in the Republic of Ireland, and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.

The section of Highmark Stadium where the Steel Army stands and supports the Riverhounds is located at the South Gate end of the stadium. The terrace there holds 1,000 supporters. On August 1, 2015, the supporters&#x27; section was renamed the Paul Child Stand in honor of Pittsburgh soccer legend Paul Child. The Steel Army had fierce rivalries with United Soccer League clubs Rochester Rhinos (Oak Street Brigade) before the club moved to USL League One.

Joel Conrad Bakan (born 1959) is an American-Canadian writer, jazz musician, filmmaker, and professor at the Peter A. Allard School of Law at the University of British Columbia.

Born in Lansing, Michigan, and raised for most of his childhood in East Lansing, Michigan, where his parents, Paul and Rita Bakan, were both long-time professors in psychology at Michigan State University. In 1971, he moved with his parents to Vancouver, British Columbia. He was educated at Simon Fraser University (BA, 1981), University of Oxford (BA in law, 1983), Dalhousie University (LLB, 1984) and Harvard University (LLM, 1986).

He served as a law clerk to Chief Justice Brian Dickson in 1985. During his tenure as clerk, Dickson authored the judgment &quot;R v Oakes&quot;, among others. Bakan then pursued a master&#x27;s degree at Harvard Law School. After graduation, he returned to Canada, where he has taught law at Osgoode Hall Law School of York University and the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law. He joined the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law in 1990 as an associate professor. Bakan teaches constitutional Law, contracts, socio-legal courses, and the graduate seminar. He has won the Faculty of Law&#x27;s Teaching Excellence Award twice and a UBC Killam Research Prize.

==Personal life==

Bakan has a son from his first wife, Marlee Gayle Kline. Kline was a scholar and Professor of Law at the University of British Columbia before passing away due to leukemia in 2001. Bakan helped establish the Marlee Kline Memorial Lectures in Social Justice to commemorate her contributions to Canadian law and feminist legal theory. He is now married to Canadian actress and singer Rebecca Jenkins. His brother, Michael Bakan, is an ethnomusicologist.

==Works==
Bakan authored &quot;The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power&quot; (2003), a book analyzing the evolution and modern-day behavior of corporations from a critical perspective. It was made into a film &quot;The Corporation&quot; by directors Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott the same year and won 25 international awards. His book &quot;Childhood Under Siege: How Big Business Ruthlessly Targets Children&quot; was published in 2011. Joel Bakan writes in &quot;The Corporation&quot;:

He is the author of books on Canadian constitutional law, including &quot;Just Words: Constitutional Rights and Social Wrongs&quot; (1997).

Bakan and his wife Rebecca Jenkins released a jazz album, &quot;Blue Skies&quot; in 2008, an album of Jenkins&#x27; original songs, &quot;Something&#x27;s Coming&quot;, in 2012, and &quot;Rebecca Jenkins: Live at the Cellar&quot; in 2014.

In 2020, he was codirector with Abbott of &quot;The New Corporation: The Unfortunately Necessary Sequel&quot;, a sequel to the original film version of &quot;The Corporation&quot;. A follow-up book &quot;The New Corporation: How &quot;Good&quot; Corporations Are Bad for Democracy&quot; was released in the same year.

<doc id="1244365" wikidata="Q4381940" url="?curid=1244365" title="Long Player (album)">
<text>Long Player is the second album by the British rock group Faces, released in February 1971. Among the highlights are a live cover version of Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot;, the ballads &quot;Richmond&quot; and &quot;Sweet Lady Mary&quot;, the party tune &quot;Had Me a Real Good Time&quot;, and uptempo saloon bar rocker &quot;Bad &#x27;n&#x27; Ruin&quot;. Two tracks, &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; and &quot;I Feel So Good&quot;, were recorded live at the Fillmore East, New York City, on 10 November 1970.

==Background==
A unique early mix of &quot;Had Me a Real Good Time&quot; appeared as a single ahead of the LP in November 1970, backed with the non-album instrumental &quot;Rear Wheel Skid&quot;. While the latter track was eventually compiled to CD with the release of the &quot;Five Guys Walk into a Bar...&quot; box set of 2004, the different early mix of the A-side remains confined to the single and early vinyl editions of &quot;Snakes and Ladders / The Best of Faces&quot; in 1976.

A studio recording of &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; also appeared as the A-side of a standalone single release in the USA just ahead of the album itself. This track and its non-LP instrumental B-side &quot;Oh Lord, I&#x27;m Browned Off&quot; were rarities among Faces collectors until they were both compiled on the &quot;Five Guys Walk into a Bar...&quot; box set.

Also recorded during this period was the band&#x27;s cover of the Temptations&#x27; &quot;(I Know) I&#x27;m Losing You&quot; which later appeared on lead singer Rod Stewart&#x27;s solo album &quot;Every Picture Tells a Story&quot; rather than on a Faces release. The band&#x27;s performance on the track was acknowledged with a &#x27;thank-you&#x27; from Stewart in the LP&#x27;s liner notes. The track was then released as a single credited to Rod Stewart and the Faces, but only in the USA. This practice led to increased murmurings of discontent in some quarters that Stewart&#x27;s management was keeping the best Faces studio performances for Stewart&#x27;s solo projects, to the detriment of the band as a unit.

== Legacy ==
On 28 August 2015, &quot;Long Player&quot; was reissued in a remastered and expanded form, including two previously unreleased outtakes, &quot;Whole Lotta Woman&quot; and &quot;Sham-Mozzal&quot; (the latter actually being an early instrumental prototype of &quot;Had Me a Real Good Time&quot;). Two more live tracks from the Fillmore East show were also included.

The reissue used the U.S. cover artwork. It was also released at the same time in the above form as part of the complete recordings box set &quot;1970-1975: You Can Make Me Dance, Sing or Anything&quot;. The album&#x27;s companion singles (aside from the unique mix of &quot;Had Me a Real Good Time&quot; as detailed above) were included in the box set on an exclusive CD of rarities.

==Early life and education==

Benz was born in Pittsburgh. Her mother, Joanne Marie (née Seemiller), was a figure skater, and her father, George Benz, Jr., is a surgeon in Pittsburgh. Benz is of German &amp; Welsh descent. 

The family settled in nearby Murrysville, Pennsylvania, when Benz was two, and she started ice skating when she was three. She attended and graduated from Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville. 

When Benz was 14, she suffered a stress fracture in her right leg and had to take time off from skating. The following year, at age 15, Benz says she was told by an acting coach that she would never succeed as an actress. &quot;I remember the teacher telling me I should not even try acting. I still have the report card where she was like, &#x27;You will never be an actor. Your voice is horrible.&#x27; That was the best thing that ever happened to me because I was like, &#x27;I&#x27;ll show you&#x27;,&quot; she later said. 

By 1989, with her figure skating career over, Benz became involved in local theater and was cast in the play &quot;Street Law&quot;. Her first film role was a small speaking part in &quot;The Black Cat&quot; segment of the Dario Argento/George A. Romero horror film &quot;Two Evil Eyes&quot; (1990). A year later, she was cast in the TV show &quot;Hi Honey, I&#x27;m Home!&quot; (1991), which was cancelled after two seasons.

<text>Aribo (or Arbo; – after 909) was margrave (&quot;comes terminalis&quot;, &quot;frontier count&quot;) of the Carolingian March of Pannonia from 871 until his death. He is recognised as a progenitor of the Aribonid dynasty.

In his day, the Pannonian march, also called &quot;marcha orientalis&quot;, corresponded to a front along the Danube river from the Bavarian Traungau up to Szombathely (&quot;Savaria&quot;) and the Rába river, including the Vienna Basin. Aribo was originally appointed by the East Frankish king Louis the German to succeed the Wilhelminer brothers William and Engelschalk I, after they died on campaign against the forces of the Great Moravian realm. This has been used to support the hypothesis that he was a brother-in-law of the two margraves.

Aribo maintained peace with Prince Svatopluk of Moravia and it paid off when, in 882, the sons of the late margraves Engelschalk I and William, led by Engelschalk II, rebelled against him, claiming their rights to the march. The Carolingian emperor Charles the Fat confirmed Aribo&#x27;s position and Engelschalk II turned to Arnulf of Carinthia, Aribo&#x27;s southern neighbour, for support. Svatopluk, however, entered the Wilhelminer War on the side of Aribo and the emperor. In 884, peace returned to the &quot;marcha&quot;.

A sign of Aribo&#x27;s strength after this was that he was unable to be unseated by Arnulf when the latter succeeded as King of East Francia in 887. In 893, Arnulf appointed Engelschalk II to a portion of the Pannonian march over Aribo&#x27;s head. Aribo never reconciled with Arnulf after the Wilhelimner War and his contacts with the Moravians were kept secure. After his falling out, his son Isanrich got Moravian support against Arnulf. Around 905, Margrave Aribo issued a customs code concerning the trade along the Danube river at Raffelstetten. He survived the disastrous Battle of Pressburg, whereafter most of the margravial territory was lost. He last appeared in a 909 deed, when he and Archbishop Pilgrim of Salzburg were vested with Altmünster Abbey by King Louis the Child.

Aribo allegedly died hunting wisents. His descendants of the Aribonid family rose to the most powerful Bavarian dynasties. They held the Archbishopric of Salzburg and the office of a Bavarian count palatine in the 10th century, but eventually were pushed out of power in the Duchy of Bavaria by the Liutpoldings.

<text>The Van&#x27;s RV-4 is an American light homebuilt aircraft supplied in kit form by Van&#x27;s Aircraft of Aurora, Oregon. It seats two people in a tandem seating configuration with the pilot accommodated in the front seat.

The Van&#x27;s RV series has become the most popular kit-built aircraft in the world. , the RV-4 is the fourth most popular RV model.

As of November 2022, 1446 RV-4s had been completed and flown worldwide.

==Development==


Richard VanGrunsven designed the RV-4 in the mid 1970s as a two-seat development of the single-seat RV-3. The RV-4 prototype first flew in August 1979.

The RV-4 is a new design based upon the concepts proven in the RV-3 and is not merely a stretched RV-3. The RV-4 airframe will accept a range of engines up to , including the Lycoming O-360. The RV-4 has a new wing, with increased wingspan and wing area over the RV-3. The RV-4 is designed for sport aerobatics.

The RV-4 has proven to be a capable cross country aircraft in service, able to carry two modest sized people and baggage on longer trips. RV-4s have been flown around the world, notably by an Australian, Jon Johanson, who completed world-girdling RV-4 flights on two occasions.

Many larger people find the RV-4 cockpit design physically constraining, and as a result VanGrunsven has designed an entire family of derivative designs. The RV-6 was designed to allow side-by-side seating, and the RV-8 was created as an enlarged aircraft that follows the RV-4&#x27;s philosophy and offers tandem seating in a bigger aircraft.

Unlike most later RV series designs, RV-4 kits are only available with conventional landing gear, although some may have been constructed in tricycle configuration by builders. At least two RV-4s have also been built with retractable landing gear (mostly for the engineering challenge, as the performance gains were modest).

==Variants==
;RV-4
:Basic version
;Harmon Rocket II
:Higher performance derivative of the RV4, with clipped wings, a Lycoming IO-540 engine and a razorback turtledeck.

<doc id="1244395" wikidata="Q734548" url="?curid=1244395" title="Odes of Solomon">
<text>The Odes of Solomon are a collection of 42 odes attributed to Solomon. There used to be confusion among scholars on the dating of the Odes of Solomon; however, most scholars date it to somewhere between AD 70 and 125. The original language of the Odes is thought to have been either Greek or Syriac, and the majority of scholars believe it to have been written by a Jewish Christian, very likely a convert from the Essene community to Christianity, because it contains multiple similarities to writings found in Qumran and to the Gospel of John. Some have argued that the writer had even personally seen John the Baptist.

Some scholars have suggested a Gnostic origin, but this theory is not universally accepted. 

== Manuscript history ==
The earliest extant manuscripts of the Odes of Solomon date from around the end of the 3rd century AD and the beginning of the 4th century AD: the Coptic &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, a Latin quote of a verse of Ode 19 by Lactantius, and the Greek text of Ode 11 in Papyrus Bodmer XI. Before the 18th century, the Odes were only known through Lactantius&#x27; quotation of one verse and their inclusion in two lists of religious literature.

The British Museum purchased the &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot; (&quot;Codex Askewianus&quot;, now British Library Add MS 5114) in 1785. The Coptic manuscript, a codex of 174 leaves, was probably composed in the late 3rd century. The manuscript contains the complete text of two of the Odes, portions of two others, and what is believed to be Ode 1 (this ode is unattested in any other manuscript and may not be complete). &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot; is a Gnostic text composed in Egypt, perhaps a translation from Greek with Syrian provenance.

After the discovery of portions of the Odes of Solomon in &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, scholars searched to find more complete copies. In 1909, James Rendel Harris discovered a pile of forgotten leaves from a Syriac manuscript lying on a shelf in his study. Unfortunately, all he could recall was that they came from the &#x27;neighbourhood of the Tigris&#x27;. The manuscript (Cod. Syr. 9 in the John Rylands Library) is the most complete of the extant texts of the Odes. The manuscript begins with the second strophe of the first verse of Ode 3 (the first two odes have been lost). The manuscript gives the entire corpus of the Odes of Solomon through to the end of Ode 42. Then the &quot;Psalms of Solomon&quot; (earlier Jewish religious poetry that is often bound with the later Odes) follow, until the beginning of Psalm 17:38 and the end of the manuscript has been lost. However, the Harris manuscript is a late copy — certainly no earlier than the 15th century.

In 1912, F. C. Burkitt discovered an older manuscript of the Odes of Solomon in the British Museum (now British Library Add MS 14538). The &quot;Codex Nitriensis&quot; came from the Monastery of the Syrian in Wadi El Natrun, sixty miles west of Cairo. It presents Ode 17:7b to the end of Ode 42, followed by the Psalms of Solomon in one continuous numbering. Nitriensis is written in far denser script than the Harris manuscript, which often makes it illegible. However, Nitriensis is earlier than Harris by about five centuries (although Mingana dated it to the 13th century).

In 1955–6, Martin Bodmer acquired a number of manuscripts. Papyrus Bodmer XI appears to be a Greek scrap-book of Christian religious literature compiled in Egypt in the 3rd century. It includes the entirety of Ode 11 (headed ΩΔΗ ΣΟΛΟΜΩΝΤΟϹ), which includes a short section in the middle of the Ode that does not occur in the Harris version of it. Internal evidence suggests that this additional material is original to the Ode, and that the later Harris manuscript has omitted it.

==Authorship==

===Language and date===
Although earlier scholars thought the Odes were originally written in Greek or Hebrew, there is now a consensus that Syriac/Aramaic was the original language. Their place of origin seems likely to have been the region of Syria. Estimates of the date of composition range from the first to the third century AD, with many settling on the second century. Some have claimed that Ode 4 discusses the closing of the temple at Leontopolis
in Egypt, which would date this writing about 73 AD. One of the strong arguments for an early date is the discovery of references to, and perhaps even quotations from, the Odes in the writings of St. Ignatius of Antioch. Possible allusions were also made by Justin Martyr and Irenaeus, which also supports an early date. The Odes have clear similarities to the Gospel of John, which suggests the writer was in the same community as where the book was written.

There is wide agreement that the Odes are related to the Gospel of John and the Dead Sea scrolls, thus Charlesworth concludes that the writer was an Essene convert to the Johannine community.

===Liturgical use===

The Odes of Solomon were, perhaps, composed for liturgical use. In the Syriac manuscripts, all of the Odes end with a &quot;hallelujah&quot;, and the Harris manuscript marks this word in the middle of an ode by the Syriac letter &quot;hê&quot; (). The use of plural imperative and jussive verb-forms suggest that on occasion a congregation is being addressed. Bernard, Aune, Pierce and others who have commented on the Odes find in them clear early baptismal imagery — water is an ever-present theme (floods, drinking the living waters, drowning and the well-spring) as is the language of conversion and initiation. Charlesworth has led the criticism of this view.

==Themes==

===Evangelism===
The Odes reflect a surprising emphasis on spreading the knowledge of God, and conversion of others.

According to James H. Charlesworth, &quot;the key characteristic in these hymns is a joyous tone of thanksgiving for the advent of the Messiah who had been promised (cf. Ode 7:1-6; 41:3-7) and for the present experience of eternal life and love from and for the Beloved (3:1-9; 11:1-24; 23:1-3; 26:1-7; 40:1-6)&quot;.

== Theology ==
Though there is some dispute, according to Chadwick the Odes are likely part of the proto-Orthodox Christian strain, with slight differences, as Odist appears to have mixed ideas from the Essene community with Christianity. Others, such as James White, have argued that the book is influenced by Gnosticism.

=== Soteriology ===

It has been argued by some that the Odes support the doctrine of predestination; for example, they state, &quot;And before they had existed, I recognized them; and imprinted a seal on their faces.&quot; Others, however, do not agree with the conclusion that the book may be interpreted as teaching any kind of unconditional election, arguing that the writer had in mind, not unconditional election, but election based on foreknowledge.

According to the American New Testament scholar Thomas R. Schreiner, the soteriology of the Odes is highly grace oriented being underlined by a doctrine of election and he argued the writer saw salvation as a work of God which is not accomplished by human merit. Thomas R. Schreiner and Brian J. Arnold argued that the book supports a form of imputed righteousness.

=== Eschatology ===
The book makes mention of the Antichrist figuratively, using the word &quot;dragon&quot; for the Antichrist.

The Odes perhaps references the general resurrection.

=== Christology ===
Some have argued that the book has docetic leanings, however it also appears to suggest that the birth of Jesus, though miraculous, was still a human birth, which would contradict docetism. It is also plausible that Ignatius of Antioch who opposed docetism (or vice versa) referenced the Odes of Solomon in his writings. Odes 8:5-6 have also been argued to refer to the resurrection of Christ. Moreover, the strong ties of the Odes to the Johannine works suggests against docetism.

The Odes of Solomon mention Christ as the Logos and that he is pre-existent. The Odes contain many common Christian teachings, such as the Messiah is the Son of God and the atonement of Jesus. The Odist calls Jesus both the son of Man and Son of God.

The Odes possibly contain the earliest non-biblical attestation of the virgin birth, depending on the date of writing.

The book mentions the mother of the Messiah, he alludes to his death by crucifixion and his descent into Hades.

=== Trinity ===
The book mentions the &quot;Father, Son and the Holy Spirit&quot; and seem to have trinitarian theology without any indications of subordinationism unlike later Tertullian and Origen would have.

=== Baptism ===
The book also apparently makes allusions to baptism but not to the Eucharist. Possible baptismal themes include renewal (Ode 36:5), new creation (Ode 15:8, 21:3), the sealing of the Holy Spirit (Ode 4:7), entry into paradise (Ode 11:16), the Trinitarian formula (Ode 23:22), and circumcision (Ode 11). The presence of these themes has led some scholars to argue that the Odes are a collection of baptismal hymns. The writer seems to have been influenced by Jewish apocalyptic thought and mysticism.

=== Other ===
The Odist perhaps has an understanding of &quot;priesthood of all believers&quot;, seeing himself as an individual priest offering spiritual sacrifices. And the book contains an explicit affirmation of the immortality of the soul.

The Odes says that Mary had no pain during childbirth and the midwife was absent, which suggests the doctrine of virginitas in partu meaning that Mary was still a virgin after childbirth. The statement could also be an allusion to the Exodus story, where Jewish women had very quick childbirth, which is why the Egyptian midwives could not come fast enough.

==Relation to the Psalms of Solomon==

Technically the Odes are anonymous, but in many ancient manuscripts, the Odes of Solomon are found together with the similar Psalms of Solomon, and Odes began to be ascribed to the same author.

==Relation to Catholic and canonical texts==
There are parallels in both style, and theology, between Odes and the writing of Ignatius of Antioch, as well as with the canonical Gospel of John. For example, both Odes and John use the concept of Jesus as Logos, and write in gentle metaphors. Harris lists the following similarities in theme between the Odes and the Johannine literature:
* Christ is the Word
* Christ existed before the foundation of the world (Odes 31, 33)
* Christ bestows living water abundantly
* Christ is the door to everything
* Christ stands to His people in the relation of Lover to Beloved
* Believers love the Lord because He first loved them (Ode 3.3)
* Believers&#x27; love to the Christ makes them His friends (Ode 8)
It has been suggested that Ode 22.12 (&quot;the foundation of everything is Your [God&#x27;s] rock. And upon it You have built Your kingdom, and it became the dwelling-place of the holy ones.&quot;) may be an earlier version of the saying in Matthew 16.18

==Relation to Gnosticism==
Some have doubted the orthodoxy of the Odes, suggesting that they perhaps originated from a heretical or gnostic group. This can be seen in the extensive use of the word &quot;knowledge&quot; (Syr. ; Gk. γνωσις gnōsis), the slight suggestion that the Saviour needed saving in Ode 8:21c ( — &quot;and the saved (are) in him who was saved&quot;) and the image of the Father having breasts that are milked by the Holy Spirit to bring about the incarnation of Christ. In the case of &quot;knowledge&quot;, it is always a reference to God&#x27;s gift of his self-revelation, and, as the Odes are replete with enjoyment in God&#x27;s good creation, they seem at odds with the gnostic concept of knowledge providing the means of release from the imperfect world. The other images are sometimes considered marks of heresy in the odist, but do have some parallel in early patristic literature.

Scholars such as H. Chadwick, Emerton, and Charlesworth are fully convinced that the text has nothing to do with Gnosticism.

===Parallels with Mandaeism===
Eric Segelberg (1958) notes similarities the Odes of Solomon share various similarities with the Mandaean Qolasta prayers, including baptism in water, signation, drinking of water, investiture, coronation, and ritual meals.

==Modern influence==

The Odes of Solomon have inspired modern musicians and their projects. In 2010, composer John Schreiner released a two-disc album called &quot;The Odes Project&quot;, which is an adaptation of the Odes of Solomon into modern music. The album &quot;Odes&quot; by Arthur Hatton, creator of LDS music website Linescratchers, was inspired by the Odes of Solomon and incorporated lines from the poems into its lyrics.

<doc id="1244397" wikidata="Q277222" url="?curid=1244397" title="Tea party">
<text>A tea party is a social gathering event, typically held in the afternoon, featuring the consumption of tea and light refreshments. Social tea drinking rituals are observed in many cultures worldwide, both historically and in the present day.

A European style tea party typically features the consumption of loose leaf tea was provided in a teapot along with milk and sugar. A variety of food including sandwiches, scones, cakes, pastries and biscuits are commonly served. Traditionally, the food served at tea parties changed seasonally. People typically consumed light foods such as fruit during summer and spring seasons and more substantial fare in fall and winter.   

Formal tea parties are generally characterised by the use of prestige utensils, such as porcelain, bone china or silver. Tables may be set with napkins and matching cups and plates. 

In the past, afternoon tea parties were hosted at home as a social gathering. In the 21st century, specialised venues for tea parties or &quot;high tea&quot; are more commonplace.

==History==
===Formal teas===
Queen Victoria reportedly ordered &quot;16 chocolate sponges, 12 plain sponges, 16 fondant biscuits&quot; along with other sweets for a tea party at Buckingham Palace. The afternoon tea party became a feature of great houses in the Victorian and Edwardian ages in the United Kingdom and the Gilded Age in the United States, as well as in all continental Europe (France, Germany, and the Russian Empire). The formal tea party still survives as an event, as in the debutante teas of some affluent American communities.

Traditionally, servants stayed outside the room until needed. This was due to the rigidity of social conventions and also reflected the intimate nature of the afternoon tea. Proving the truth of 18th-century author Henry Fielding&#x27;s quip that &quot;love and scandal are the best sweeteners of tea&quot;, the custom of banning servants from the drawing room during tea shows the hostess&#x27;s desire to encourage free conversation among her guests. Most of the formalities of that age have disappeared, particularly since World War II, when economic changes made household servants a rarity, but afternoon tea can still provide a good opportunity for intimate conversation and a refreshing light meal.

Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s favourite tea cakes were honey and cream sponge and chocolate biscuit cake. Tea sandwiches might include smoked salmon, egg mayonnaise or ham and mustard among other offerings. Crustless triangle shaped tuna sandwiches can be served on buttered loaves with thinly sliced cucumbers.

===&quot;Kettle drums&quot;===

&quot;Kettle drums&quot; came about in 18th and 19th centuries and are informal large afternoon parties for tea. At kettle drums, guests traditionally came for short periods and left at will, mingled and conversed with little formality, and partook of tea, chocolate, lemonade, cakes, and sandwiches. Guests were expected to dress for ordinary daytime visiting, but not more formally.

Per false folk etymology, the name &quot;kettle drum&quot; is said to have originated in the informal tea gatherings hosted by British camp officers&#x27; wives during East India Company rule or the British occupation of India, during which kettle drums are claimed to have served as tea tables in the camps. Alternatively, &quot;kettle drum&quot; may have been an amalgam of &quot;drum&quot; — 18th-century slang for a vivacious party — and &quot;kettle&quot; for the tea served.

== Etiquette ==
Tea party etiquette depends on the customs and accepted standards of behaviour of a given time period and place. 1900 etiquette demonstrated etiquette to be linked with conservative and rigid gender roles. Manners were of utmost importance in the proper conduct of men and women in early tea parties. 

There are several rules of etiquette noted during the 19th and 20th centuries. Various rules of etiquette included:

# Learn to be patient
# Restrain your temper
# Refrain from speaking in anger
# Silence is more valuable than speech

==Children&#x27;s parties==
Tea parties are sometimes hosted by young children where the guests consist of stuffed animals, dolls, friends (both real and imaginary) and family members.

==Representations in literature==
In Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, in the chapter &quot;A Mad Tea-Party&quot;, Alice becomes a guest at a tea party along with the March Hare, the Hatter, and a sleeping Dormouse who remains asleep for most of the chapter. The other characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous &#x27;Why is a raven like a writing desk?&#x27;. The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because time has punished him by eternally standing still at 6 pm (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves, claiming that it was the craziest tea party that she had ever attended.

==Global analogs==
*Yum cha is the Chinese equivalent of a tea party, usually held in a restaurant.

*The German &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;coffee gossip&quot;, is an afternoon gathering – stereotypically of housewives – in which coffee or tea is drunk, cakes are eaten, and gossip is exchanged.

<text>Emil Ritter von Škoda ( ; 18 November 1839 – 8 August 1900) was a Czech engineer and industrialist, founder of Škoda Works, the predecessor of today&#x27;s Škoda Auto and Škoda Transportation.

==Life and work==
Born Emil Škoda in Plzeň on 18 November 1839 to a physician and politician František Škoda, and mother Anna Říhová. Škoda studied engineering in Prague and Karlsruhe and in 1866 became chief engineer of the machine factory of Ernst Fürst von Waldstein-Wartenberg, founded in 1859 at Plzeň. He bought the factory three years later, in 1869, and began to expand it, building a railway connection to the facility in 1886 and adding an arms factory in 1890 to produce machine guns for the Austro-Hungarian Army. His facilities continued to expand over the next decade, and he incorporated his holdings in 1899 as the Škoda Works, which would become famous for its arms production in both World War I and World War II and for a wide range of other industrial and transportation products.

<doc id="1244402" wikidata="Q537420" url="?curid=1244402" title="Gas balloon">
<text>A gas balloon is a balloon that rises and floats in the air because it is filled with a gas lighter than air (such as helium or hydrogen). When not in flight, it is tethered to prevent it from flying away and is sealed at the bottom to prevent the escape of gas. A gas balloon may also be called a &quot;Charlière&quot; for its inventor, the Frenchman Jacques Charles. Today, familiar gas balloons include large blimps and small latex party balloons. For nearly 200 years, well into the 20th century, manned balloon flight utilized gas balloons before hot-air balloons became dominant. Without power, heat or fuel, untethered flights of gas balloons depended on the skill of the pilot. Gas balloons have greater lift for a given volume, so they do not need to be so large, and they can stay up for much longer than hot air balloons.

==History==

The first gas balloon made its flight in August 1783. Designed by professor Jacques Charles and Les Frères Robert, it carried no passengers or cargo. On 1 December 1783, their second hydrogen-filled balloon made a manned flight piloted by Jacques Charles and Nicolas-Louis Robert. This occurred ten days after the first manned flight in a Montgolfier hot air balloon.

The next project of Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers was &quot;La Caroline&quot;, an elongated steerable craft that followed Jean Baptiste Meusnier&#x27;s proposals for a dirigible balloon, incorporating internal ballonnets (air cells), a rudder and a method of propulsion. On September 19, 1784 the brothers and M. Collin-Hullin flew for 6 hours 40 minutes, covering 186 km from Paris to Beuvry near Béthune. This was the first flight over 100 km.

Gas balloons remained popular throughout the age before powered flight. Filled with hydrogen or coal gas, they were able to fly higher, further and more economically than hot-air balloons. The altitude was controlled with ballast weights that were dropped if the balloon got too low; in order to land some lifting gas was vented through a valve. Tethered manned gas balloons were used for observation purposes in the Napoleonic Wars (to very limited extent), in the American Civil War (flown by Thaddeus Lowe) and in World War I by aviators wearing parachutes. Throughout the 19th century, they were popular as objects of public fascination among hobbyists and show performers, such as the Blanchards.

Throughout the mid 20th century, spherical free gas balloons were used by the United States Navy to train airship crews.

Gas ballooning has been popular in Europe, most notably in Germany, using hydrogen as a lifting gas. Gas balloon clubs exist throughout the country. Rough estimates show 150 active gas pilots in Europe. In contrast, gas ballooning in the USA might have at most 30 active pilots who typically fly only once a year at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta in October.

&quot;Aerophile&quot; is the world&#x27;s largest lighter-than-air carrier, flying 300,000 passengers every year through its eight tethered gas balloon operations in Walt Disney World, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, Smoky Mountains &amp; Irvine in the US and Paris, Disneyland Paris and Parc du Petit Prince in France.

==Records==
On October 24, 2014, Alan Eustace, a former Google executive, made a jump from the stratosphere, breaking Felix Baumgartner&#x27;s 2012 world record. The launch-point for his jump was from an abandoned runway in Roswell, New Mexico, where he began his balloon-powered ascent early that morning. He reached a reported maximum altitude of 135,908 feet (41.425 km; 25.7402 mi), but the final number submitted to the World Air Sports Federation was 135,889.108 feet (41.419000 km; 25.7365735 mi). The balloon used for the feat was manufactured by the Balloon Facility of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Hyderabad, India. Eustace in his pressure suit hung tethered under the balloon, without the kind of capsule used by Felix Baumgartner. Eustace started his fall by using an explosive device to separate from the helium balloon.

The previous altitude record for a manned balloon flight was set at 39.045 kilometers on October 14, 2012 by Felix Baumgartner breaking a record of 34.7 kilometers on May 4, 1961 by Malcolm Ross and Victor Prather in a balloon launched from the deck of the in the Gulf of Mexico.

The altitude record for an unmanned balloon is 53.7 kilometers. It was reached by a stratospheric balloon manufactured by JAXA with a volume of 80,000 m³, launched in September 2013 from in Hokkaido, Japan. This is the greatest height ever obtained by an atmospheric vehicle. Only rockets, rocket planes, and ballistic projectiles have flown higher.

In 2015, pilots Leonid Tiukhtyaev and Troy Bradley arrived safely in Baja California, Mexico, after a journey of 10,711 km. The two men, originally from Russia and the United States of America respectively, started in Japan and flew with a helium balloon over the Pacific. In 160 hours and 34 minutes, the balloon, named &quot;Two Eagles&quot;, arrived in Mexico, setting the longest distance and duration records for gas balloons.

== On other planets==

The Soviet Union space probes Vega 1 and Vega 2 each dropped a helium balloon with scientific experiments into the atmosphere of Venus in 1985. The balloons first entered the atmosphere and descended to about 50 km, then inflated for level flight. Otherwise the flight was uncontrolled. Each balloon relayed wind and atmospheric conditions for 46 hours of a possible 60-hour electric battery power budget.

<text>Malacorhynchus is a genus of duck within the family Anatidae. It was established in 1831 by English ornithologist William Swainson, when he proposed moving the pink-eared duck into a subgenus (&quot;Malacorhynchus&quot;) based on unique characters of its beak and toes. The genus contains one living and one extinct species.

<doc id="1244421" wikidata="Q1549498" url="?curid=1244421" title="Toyota T100">
<text>The Toyota T100 is a full-size pickup truck manufactured and marketed by Toyota for model years 1993-1998 for the US and Canada over a single generation.

==History==
As Toyota established itself in the North American compact pickup truck market in the 1980s through 1990s, the company offered a truck that was larger than the compact as an alternative to the traditional North American full-size pickup truck market. North American Toyota dealers had long been requesting a full-sized Toyota truck, especially in light of the high percentage of Toyota Pickup owners who moved on to domestic full-sized trucks. The T100 reflected a philosophy of designing products specifically for localized international markets, where traditional products sold and made in Japan wouldn&#x27;t sell well. This approach is also demonstrated with the introduction of the mid-size Toyota Camry (XV10) which was larger than the compact Toyota Camry (V30) in 1991, and again in 1997 when the Toyota Sienna replaced the slow selling Toyota Previa.

Rumored for many years before, the 1993 Toyota T100 boasted a full-size (8 ft) pickup bed but retained the engine and suspension setup of its smaller and older sibling, the compact Toyota Truck. Although the T100 was a bit larger than the competitive mid-size Dodge Dakota, it was still markedly smaller than full-size American pickup trucks of the time. This meant that the T100 occupied its own niche in the truck market. Before introducing the T100, the company reflected on its history of commercial truck manufacture and products they offered in the past. Past products started with the Toyota G1, the Toyota FA, the Toyota BX, the Toyota Stout, the Toyota ToyoAce, and the Toyota Dyna, and its market successes with their Hino Division. Though economical, reliable, and practical, the T100 was slow to be accepted by traditional buyers of full-size competitors, while it was larger than both the Toyota Truck followed by the Toyota Tacoma compact trucks. Wary of the market pushback of competing directly with the Big Three, Toyota chose this somewhat smaller size (and limited lineup) so as not to risk blowback and import quotas. The T100 was designed and engineered for the North American market and was not sold in Japan.

Although sales were slow at the start, the T100 sales did reach into the mid 40,000 vehicles sold range (1996) in the United States. Sales of the Chevrolet C/K were roughly 700,000 per year, while sales of the Ford F-Series surged from 550,000 to nearly 850,000 and Dodge from 100,000 to 400,000 with the introduction of the new Dodge Ram in 1993. Sales of the T100 fell approximately 30 percent when the new Ram went on the market in October 1993, 11 months after the T100&#x27;s launch in November 1992.

==Reception==
Upon introduction, the T100 was criticized for being too small to appeal to buyers of full-size work trucks, the lack of an extended cab, and the lack of a V8 engine; with the only available engine was a 3.0 liter V6, which was already found in Toyota&#x27;s compact trucks and in the 4Runner. Although considered criticisms by many, Toyota stated these were all factors that were taken into consideration when designing and producing the T100. They claimed the smaller size was planned to offer a larger truck with a compact &quot;feel&quot;, an Xtracab was on the horizon and the 3.0 liter V6 would provide far better fuel economy than the vehicles it aspired to rival. Both the V6 engine and the somewhat smaller dimensions were influenced by environmental concerns, issues that were irrelevant to American pickup buyers.

Despite the criticisms of size and horsepower, the T100 was also praised by the media, acquiring J.D. Power and Associates Initial Quality Survey &quot;Best Full-Size Pickup&quot; award and the &quot;Best of What&#x27;s New&quot; award by Popular Science magazine in its first year on the market. The T100 was the first vehicle – car or truck – ever to receive an &quot;Initial Quality Survey Award&quot; in its first year of production. For 1994 (the truck&#x27;s second model year) and 1995 (the third), the T100 was again awarded &quot;Best Full-Size Pickup in Initial Quality&quot; by J.D. Power and Associates. In 1997 the T100 was awarded &quot;Top Three Vehicles in Initial Quality – Full-Size Segment&quot; once again by J.D. Power and Associates.

When it was introduced, the T100 had one cab configuration, a regular cab, and one available engine, a 3.0 L V6 with and of torque. In 1993, a 2.7 L inline-four engine with - same as for the 3.0 V6 - and of torque was added in the hopes new buyers would be drawn in with promises of greater fuel economy and a lower price than on the initial offerings. The T100 was the first imported pickup truck that could carry a 4 by 8 feet plywood sheet between the wheelwells. The regular cab could seat three abreast in the front bench seat; this was split on the SR5 model. Automatics received a column shift while manuals were floor mounted, where the transfer case shifter was also located on 4WD models.

Toyota ultimately realized there was no alternative but to add more power to the truck and for the 1995 model year Toyota added the and of torque 3.4 L V6. An Xtracab model came along several months into the 1995 model year as well, sitting on the same wheelbase with a bed. This provided a boost in sales of 150 percent for 1995. The T100 received only minor changes throughout its run, aside from the engine changes and the Xtracab addition. A driver-side airbag was installed for MY 1994 (a passenger-side airbag never became available), and larger 16-inch wheels became the norm for most of the 4X4 models starting in 1996. It was evident by late 1996/ early 1997 that Toyota was already investing in its next truck (what ultimately became the Toyota Tundra). At the time (late 1990s) some believed a revamped T100 with a V8 engine was on the way, and there were some reports that altered V8 powered T100s were used as test-mules, but ultimately it never came to pass, and the T100 was superseded by the Toyota Tundra.

Toyota Racing Development (TRD) introduced a supercharger for the 3.4-liter engine in 1996 and it became available for the T100, the Tacoma and the 4Runner with the 3.4-liter V6 (and later the Tundra). Horsepower jumped to the range (depending on the generation of the supercharger) and to of torque. This power add on was available for 1997–1998 T100s only. Earlier 3.4 V6 powered T100s have different computer and electrical layouts which do not support the TRD device.

The T100 was manufactured and partially engineered by Toyota-subsidiary Hino. Three trim lines were offered: the base model, the &quot;DX&quot;, and the top-of-the-line &quot;SR5&quot;. The maximum towing capacity was 5,200 lb (2,360 kg) and the truck had a payload limit of 2,450 pounds. Although most trucks fell within the 1/2 ton category, a 1-ton model was offered (in two-wheel drive form) for several of its earlier years until finally being dropped because of a lack of interest.

All T100s were assembled in Tokyo, Japan and as a result were subject to a 25% import tariff on all imported light trucks. The T100 was the last Japanese-built Toyota pickup made for North America when production ceased in July 1998, sales being phased out in August and ending with the 1998 model year. The T100 was replaced by the larger V8-powered Tundra which debuted in 1999. Toyota had originally planned to continue the T100 naming system by calling the new truck the &quot;Toyota T-150&quot;; Ford made a successful claim that this was a trademark infringement of their F-150 and the name had to be changed.

<doc id="1244424" wikidata="Q3328601" url="?curid=1244424" title="Berber music">
<text>Berber music refers to the musical traditions of the Berbers, a diverse grouping of distinct ethnic groups indigenous to North Africa who predate the arrival of Arabs in the Arab migration to the Maghreb. Their main connections are identified by their usage of the mostly mutually unintelligible Berber languages. Berber music varies widely across North Africa. It is stylistically diverse, with songs being predominantly African rhythms and a stock of oral literature.

Ancient Berber music is stylistically diverse, with styles including pentatonic music, such instruments as the oboe and the bagpipes, and African rhythms along with singing. These ancient musical traditions have been kept alive by small bands of musicians traveling from village to village, entertaining at weddings and other social events with their songs, tales and poetry.

Most Berber music is of the village-folk and urban-folk musical variety. Berber music and culture is influenced by—in addition to aesthetics and style—the Berber people&#x27;s long-standing struggle to achieve basic language rights and identity recognition in modern North African societies.

==Musical/vocal styles==
Berber music is characterized by its use of folk oral traditions, as well as particular scales and rhythmic patterns, which include pentatonic music and African rhythms. All these elements are combined to form one of the main sources of entertainment in Berber social ceremonies like marriages, as well as verses, tales and songs.

==Instrumentation==

The Berber people are spread out over a large part of Africa, but are mostly concentrated in the northwestern region of Africa. They use a vast array of both melodic and percussive instruments. The following instruments are part of their secular and religious dance and song:

*&quot;Taghanimt&quot;, an end-blown reed flute. Used mostly to accompany songs rather than dance, the &quot;taghanimt&quot; has a rich, breathy texture.
*&quot;Mizwid&quot;, a type of bagpipe; the term literally means &quot;bag&quot; or &quot;food pouch&quot;.
*&quot;Zukra&quot; (Tunisia) or &quot;ghaytah&quot; (Morocco). In both countries, these instruments are combined with several percussive instruments to create large ensembles which may perform at public festivals or similar occasions.
*&quot;Nafir&quot;, a long natural horn, a type of valveless trumpet. This instrument is used mostly as a signaling instrument to send out messages to large groups, although it also has some performance value.
*&quot;Ginbri&quot; (Morocco), a fretless plucked string instrument with a skin stretched over its body on the playing side: the skin has the same acoustic function as the membrane on a banjo. Most ensembles have at least one ginbri, although some have more than one.
*&quot;Rebab&quot;, a long-necked bowed instrument with a large body. Like the ginbri, it is constructed with a skin on the string side. This instrument has only one string, usually of horse hair, and is commonly played alongside the ginbri.
*&quot;Tabl&quot; (), a cylindrical double-sided drum. Although it has a similar usage and spelling to the tabla of India, no direct connection has been found between the two. The &quot;qas&#x27;ah&quot; is a large shallow kettledrum found mostly in Tunisia. Similar to the qas&#x27;ah is the &quot;Naqqarah&quot;, two ceramic kettledrums played simultaneously by both hands.
*&quot;Bendir&quot; (Morocco and Algeria ), a snare frame-drum. A series of bendirs played simultaneously provide the main percussive rhythm for Berber music as the above-mentioned drums are more artistic than bendirs.
*&quot;Qaraqib&quot;, a large metal castanet-like musical instrument. Normally one is held in each hand. These may be used to keep a rhythm or to play their own pattern.
*Tende, a drum made with mortar and pestle.

==Algeria==

The music of the Kabyle Berbers has achieved some mainstream success outside of its Kabylia homeland, both in the rest of Algeria and abroad. Traditional Kabyle music consists of vocalists accompanied by a rhythm section, consisting of t&#x27;bel (tambourine) and bendir (frame drum), and a melody section, consisting of a ghaita (bagpipe) and ajouag (flute).

===Development of Kabyle music===
In the 1930s, Kabyles moved in large numbers to Paris, where they established cafes where musicians like added modern, Western instruments like the banjo, guitar and violin to Kabyle folk melodies. Slimane Azem was a Kabyle immigrant who was inspired by Nourredine and 19th century poet Si Mohand Ou Mohand to address homesickness, poverty and passion in his songs, and he soon (like many Kabyle musicians) became associated with the Algerian independence movement.

By the 1950s, Arab classical music, especially Egyptian superstars like Umm Kulthum, had become popular and left a lasting influence on Kabyle music, specifically in lush orchestration. Cherif Kheddam soon arose with the advent of a Kabyle branch of Radio Algiers after independence in 1962, when France called a cease fire on 19 March and enacted the voting upon an agreement during a referendum in June. Included here were the Evian Accords which, for three years with all Algerians gave certain legal protections to colons equally. After the three years however, all Europeans would have to become Algerian citizens or risk being classified as aliens, which would then make them lose rights. Some of the rights discussed in the Accords were the right to participate in public affairs, the right to a full range of cultural and civic rights and the right to own property. Female singers also became popular during this period, especially Cherifa, Djamilla and Hanifa.

Algerian independence did not lead to increased freedom for Kabyle musicians, and these Berbers soon included often covert lyrics criticizing the Ben Bella government, which had little repercussion due to the Evian Accords. Many of these musicians were inspired by other singer-songwriters, including Joan Baez and Bob Dylan, Víctor Jara and Silvio Rodríguez. With the song &quot;A Vava Inouva&quot; (1973), Idir brought international attention to Kabyle music and paved the way for the Algerian raï genre. Ferhat Mehenni, known for his politically uncompromising lyrics, Lounis Ait Menguellet, known for his poetic and inspired lyrics, also became popular during the 1970s and Amour Abdenour, whose ongoing career started in 1969 wrote and performed about kabyle society, nature and more importantly love relationships.

By the time raï became popular in Europe in the 1980s, Kabyle artists were also moving towards sentimental, pop-ballads. Hassen Zermani&#x27;s all-electric Takfarinas and Abdelli&#x27;s work with Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World helped bring Kabyle music to new audiences, while the murder of Matoub Lounes inspired many Kabyles to rally around their popular musicians.

Modern singers include Djur Djura and many chawi singers and groups like Houria Aichi, Les Berberes, Amirouch, Massinissa, Amadiaz, Numidas, Mihoub, Massilia, Merkunda, Thiguyer, Salim Souhali (Thaziri), Dihya, and Messaoud Nedjahi.

==Morocco==

Traditional Moroccan Berber music can be categorised into collective and professional music.
In collective musical performances, men and women from entire families or villages participate in communal dances such as the &quot;ahwash&quot; and &quot;ahidus&quot;. A prayer is chanted at the beginning, followed by a response from a chorus of dancers. Accompanied by drums or ) and other percussion instruments, performers dance in two parallel rows or in a circle around the musicians.

Led by an or poet, groups of usually four professional musicians () travel across the region to perform in various villages. The recites improvised poems about current national and world affairs. His fellow musicians accompany the poem with a drum, a single-string and a double clarinet.

A Shluh tradition of community music and dance is performed by the musicians and singers of the style, led by a or . A performance starts with the , an instrumental session on the &quot;rebab&quot; or &quot;lutar&quot;, followed by the tambourine and flute. The sets the basic notes of the melody. The middle section consists of sung poetry (), a choreographed overture (), a lively song (), and dance (). The marks the final part, in which the rhythm first accelerates and then ceases abruptly. In 2021, an anthology of the art of the &quot;Rrways - a journey into the realm of Amazigh wandering poet-singers&quot;, presenting a booklet and ten compact discs with current recordings, received the &#x27; Prix Coups de Cœur - Musiques du Monde&#x27; of the Académie Charles Cross in France.

Famous Moroccan Berber musicians include Ammouri Mbarek, a singer and songwriter active since the 1960s and considered by many Berber music enthusiasts to be the &quot;John Lennon&quot; of the Berbers, and Najat Aatabou, a singer whose debut cassette, &quot;J&#x27;en ai Marre&quot;, sold an unprecedented half-million copies in Morocco. The Master Musicians of Jajouka tour internationally and have collaborated with Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones and William S. Burroughs.

Many musicians have created fusion styles from Berber and European music, including Hindi Zahra, Hassan Hakmoun, Khalid Izri, Hassan Idbasaid, Thidrin, Med Ziani, Imtlaa, Houssaine Kili, Salima Ziani, Abdelhak Akandouch and others.

==Tuaregs==

The Berber music of the Tuareg region uses rhythms and vocal styles similar to the music of other Berber, Iberian, and Arab music, while West African call-and-response-style singing is also common. In contrast to many of the region&#x27;s peoples, among the Tuareg music is mostly the domain of women, especially playing the imzhad, a string instrument like a violin. Tuareg weddings feature unique styles of music, such as women&#x27;s vocal trilling and special dances (ilkan) of slaves marking the occasion.

<doc id="1244445" wikidata="Q7070711" url="?curid=1244445" title="Nuʻuanu Pali">
<text>Nuuanu Pali is a section of the windward cliff (&quot;pali&quot; in Hawaiian) of the Koolau mountain located at the head of Nuuanu Valley on the island of Oahu. It has a panoramic view of the windward (northeast) coast of Oahu. The Pali Highway (Hawaii State Highway 61) connecting Kailua/Kāneohe with downtown Honolulu runs through the Nuuanu Pali Tunnels bored into the cliffside.

The area is also the location of the Nuuanu Freshwater Fish Refuge and the Nuuanu Reservoir in the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources.

The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside is a lookout above the tunnels where there is a panoramic view of Oahu&#x27;s windward side with views of Kāneohe, Kāneohe Bay, and Kailua. It is also well known for strong trade winds that blow through the pass (now bypassed by the Nuuanu Pali Tunnels). The Nuʻuanu Pali Tunnels were built in 1958. Before this road opened, people would use what is now known as the Old Pali Road, currently a popular hiking route.
== History ==
The Nuuanu Pali has been a vital pass from ancient times to the present because it is a low, traversable section of the Koolau mountain range that connects the leeward side of the mountains, Honolulu to the windward side, Kailua and Kāneohe. The route drew settlers who formed villages in the area and populated Nuuanu Valley for a thousand years.

The Nuuanu Pali was the site of the Battle of Nuuanu, one of the bloodiest battles in Hawaiian history, in which Kamehameha I conquered the island of Oahu, bringing it under his rule. In 1795 Kamehameha I sailed from his home island of Hawaii with an army of 10,000 warriors, including a handful of non-Hawaiian foreigners. After conquering the islands of Maui and Molokai, he moved on to Oahu. The pivotal battle for the island occurred in Nuuanu Valley, where the defenders of Oahu, led by Kalanikūpule, were driven back up into the valley where they were trapped above the cliff. Kamehamehaʻs warriors forced Maui Chief Kalanikupule&#x27;s men to their deaths off of the cliff. Roughly 400 warriors died in this battle.

In 1845 the first road was built over the Nuuanu Pali, to connect Windward Oahu with Honolulu. In 1898, as this road was developed into a highway, workers found 800 human skulls—believed to be the remains of the warriors who fell to their deaths from the cliff above. This road was later replaced by the Pali Highway and the Nuuanu Pali Tunnels in 1959, which is the route used today.

The now extinct bird, the Oahu nukupuu, was last collected in this valley.

There is also a legend that takes place around the Nuʻuanu Pali. This is &quot;The Ghost Dog Legend.&quot; This legend states that when people came across this dog on the Pali, they had to turn back around or else they would not make it up the steep mountain. Because of these events, it is said that coming across this dog would lead to &quot;kaupe&quot;, meaning disaster.

== Nuuanu Reservoir ==
The Nuuanu Reservoir is located up the Nuuanu Pali heading towards Kailua, in the valley jungle. This small body of water holds various species of catfish, and peacock bass. In efforts towards preserving the reservoir, appointments must be made half a year prior to the visiting date. This ensures a controlled number of residents that fish out of the waters, preventing overfishing. A fresh water game fishing license and an entry fishing card are required to fish there. There is a two fish per license limit, and any catfish that is 16 inches or larger must be kept.

==Nuuanu Trail==
The trail to Nuuanu began at Kalanikahua and led north of Kaumakapili Church to below the stream which flowed out of Kamanuwai pond. There the trail turned slightly to the right, went along the edge of the pond, and down into the water. Then, coming up on the bank onto Waiakemi, it led on to Waakekupua, along the bank of the taro patches, to the Pauoa stream, up to Pualoalo, and on to the gap at Nuuanu Pali.

==Superstition==

Two large stones near the back of Nuuanu Valley, Hapuu and Ka-lae-hau-ola, were said to represent a pair of goddesses who were guardians of the passage down the pali. Travellers would leave offerings of flowers or &quot;kapa&quot; (bark cloth) to ensure a safe trip, and parents buried the umbilical cords of newborns under the stones as a protection against evil.

According to legend, the pass is inhabited by a &quot;moo wahine&quot;, a lizard who takes the form of a beautiful woman and leads male travelers to their deaths off the cliff, similar to a western poltergeist or mermaid.

Hawaiian folklore holds that people should never carry pork over Nuuanu Pali, especially at night. Pele, the volcano goddess, was responsible for preventing passage due to her contest with Kamapua&#x27;a, a half human, half hog god, and would not allow him (in the form of pork) to trespass on her side of the island.

==Cultural references==
&quot;Pali Gap&quot; (Nu&#x27;uanu Pali into English) is the title of a track from the posthumous 1971 album &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; by the guitarist Jimi Hendrix.

&#x27;The Pali&#x27;, together with surrounding areas such as Tantalus Crater, is the main setting in the novel &quot;Micro&quot; by Michael Crichton and Richard Preston.

The 2015 movie &quot;Pali Road&quot; is named for the old road over the Pali, although most of the action takes place elsewhere on Oahu.

<doc id="1244458" wikidata="Q642549" url="?curid=1244458" title="Francisco Scaramanga">
<text>Francisco Scaramanga is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the James Bond novel and film version of &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;. Scaramanga is an assassin who kills with his signature weapon, a pistol made of solid gold. In the novel, the character is nicknamed &quot;Pistols&quot; Scaramanga and is also called &quot;Paco&quot; (a Spanish diminutive of Francisco). In the film, the character was played by Christopher Lee (the real-life step-cousin of James Bond creator Ian Fleming).

As with another of James Bond&#x27;s nemeses, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, in 2007 the Daily Mail reported that the inspiration for this fictional character was a classmate of Fleming&#x27;s, at Eton College in the 1920s, George Ambrosios (Ambrose) Scaramanga.

== Novel biography ==
Francisco Scaramanga, of Spanish (Catalonia) origin, became a trick shot while a youngster, and he performed in a circus owned by his father Enrico. Francisco also cared for one of the circus elephants, which he stated was his only real friend. When the elephant went on a rampage during the circus visit to Trieste, Scaramanga witnessed a policeman kill it. The enraged boy, who was 16 at the time, retaliated by shooting the policeman through the eye. He then made his way to the United States from Naples, where he found employment as an enforcer for the Spangled Mob, an outfit that plays a role in two other Bond novels: &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (where they were the main foe of Agent 007) and &quot;Goldfinger&quot; as an accomplice to Auric Goldfinger&#x27;s Operation Grandslam. He posed as a pitboy at the casino of Tiara Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, while in fact he was executioner of cheats and other transgressors within and outside the gang. In 1958 he was forced to emigrate from the US because of his gun duel with Ramon &quot;The Rod&quot; Rodriguez, his opposite from the Purple Gang of Detroit (also featured in the novel &quot;Goldfinger&quot;), in which he killed Ramon, earning $100,000. He spent some time travelling the Caribbean as a representative of Las Vegas interests in real estate and plantation dealing, later switching to Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic and Fulgencio Batista of Cuba where he settled in 1959, in Havana. While remaining a Batista supporter, he started an undercover work for Fidel Castro&#x27;s party, becoming an &quot;enforcer&quot; for DSS after the Cuban Revolution.

By the time Bond finally encounters him in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, Scaramanga works as a freelance assassin, often working for Castro&#x27;s secret police, in addition to being engaged in other criminal enterprises such as drug-running into the United States in partnership with the KGB. MI6 has evaluated Scaramanga as one of the finest shots in the world, and M authorizes Bond to assassinate the gunman — if he can.

Bond catches up with Scaramanga in Jamaica, where Bond pretends to be a freelance security officer named Mark Hazard. and Scaramanga hires him to guard an upcoming meeting of gangsters. During the meeting, a Dutch-born KGB officer named Hendricks reveals Bond&#x27;s identity, resulting in a shootout between Scaramanga and Bond. Bond wounds him, but before Bond can kill Scaramanaga, Scaramanga shoots Bond with a poisoned bullet from his backup weapon, a golden derringer. Bond returns fire with his .32 Walther PPK pistol, killing Scaramanga instantly; soon thereafter, a policeman finds the nearly dead Bond in time to save him.

In the novel, British intelligence also has an in-depth psychological profile of Scaramanga, which is printed in the book before the mission begins. He is tall, slim and fit. He is about 35 years old and has light brown eyes. His hair is reddish in a crew-cut with long sideburns. The profile (read by M) also delves into his background and psyche. Among other things, the profile claims that Scaramanga might be a latent homosexual, since he cannot whistle—based on the popular (but unfounded) theory that a man who cannot whistle has homosexual tendencies.

== Film biography ==
In the feature film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, Scaramanga is a high-priced assassin, supposedly the best in the world, charging US$1 million per kill. He is best known for being &quot;the man with the golden gun&quot;, for using only bullets made of gold in a custom 4.2 mm cartridge with a disassemblable golden handgun made of a gold cigarette case, gold cigarette lighter, gold fountain pen and gold cufflink as the gun&#x27;s trigger. All of Scaramanga&#x27;s assassination contracts are arranged through his henchman Nick Nack, which allows Scaramanga to be anonymous. His specialized ammunition is made by a custom gunsmith in Macau, who provides for its delivery to Scaramanga&#x27;s lover, Andrea Anders, at a casino in Hong Kong.

Francisco Scaramanga was a British national born in a travelling circus. His father was the ringmaster, a former Cuban national and his mother was the snake charmer. By age 10, Francisco was part of the circus as a trick-shot pistol marksman. At age 15, he became an international assassin-for-hire. He was recruited some years later by the KGB while living in Ipanema, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and trained in Eastern Europe where for many years he was basically just another &quot;overworked and underpaid assassin&quot; for the KGB. He quit the KGB in the late 1950s, becoming an independent hitman-for hire. No photographs of him exist, but he has an unusual anatomy: a third nipple. This information later comes in handy to Bond, who uses Scaramanga&#x27;s anonymity and only known physical feature to get into contact with Scaramanga&#x27;s current employer, the crime lord Hai-Fat—though Scaramanga is already at Hai-Fat&#x27;s estate, and Hai-Fat quickly guesses who Bond really is.

Later in the film, Scaramanga reveals to Bond that as a boy living in the travelling circus, he shot and killed an abusive animal trainer for killing an elephant that he had befriended—and discovered that he &quot;enjoyed killing people&quot;. Scaramanga also demonstrates his marksmanship to Bond by using a Colt Single Action Army to shoot the cork off a bottle of champagne from long range (Scaramanga&#x27;s golden gun in the novel is a gold-plated Single Action Army), later dismissing it as a toy.

Scaramanga lives very well, drawing from the exorbitant sums of money he charges to carry out his assassinations. His home is on his own personal island somewhere off the coast of southeastern China—paying for lease of the island and protection through assassinations (&#x27;favours&#x27;) for the Chinese. Despite his assertion that &quot;science was never [his] strong point,&quot; the island utilizes many aspects of modern technology, including its own self-sufficient solar power plant. In addition to the power plant, Scaramanga&#x27;s home also includes a section which is something between a labyrinth and a funhouse, where Scaramanga and his foes duel to the death. Nick Nack hires assassins to kill Scaramanga as a challenge to keep him sharp; moreover Nick Nack will also inherit Scaramanga&#x27;s entire fortune should one of the assassins succeed. Scaramanga is well aware of and approves of Nick Nack&#x27;s efforts, and wishes him better luck next time when his hired guns fail. In addition, Scaramanga also has a private junk, which Bond later steals to exit the exploding island.

Scaramanga also uses some of his wealth to finance research and development of technologies that rival those developed by MI6&#x27;s Q Branch. Such technologies include a car that transforms into an aircraft and a solar-powered laser cannon.

Scaramanga was hired by Hai-Fat to assassinate a British scientist named Gibson, thought to be in possession of solar energy information and technology crucial to solving the energy crisis. Gibson is assassinated and his invention, the solex agitator, is stolen from the crime scene by Nick Nack. The solex agitator is a critical component of Gibson&#x27;s solar energy device. However, instead of turning the device over to Hai-Fat, Scaramanga instead kills Hai-Fat with his golden gun and takes the device and Hai-Fat&#x27;s company for himself. With it in his possession, it allows for him to sell the device to the highest criminal bidder or use it to power his personal solar energy cannon.

Scaramanga also desires to test his skills against Bond, whom he regards as his only worthy rival. Besides the profit and/or power the solex agitator can give him, Scaramanga&#x27;s scheme in acquiring the device is also intended to lure Bond to Scaramanga&#x27;s private island so that the two of them can engage in one final, decisive duel. Although Bond is using his six-bullet .380 Walther PPK pistol while Scaramanga uses the golden gun, Scaramanga states that &quot;[He] only need[s] one&quot;—Bond&#x27;s superior number of bullets being offset by Scaramanga&#x27;s advantages of fighting on his own ground.

After taking Bond&#x27;s fellow MI6 agent Mary Goodnight hostage, Scaramanga lures Bond to his private island, where he reveals his plan and challenges Bond to a duel in his funhouse, after a tense discussion where Scaramanga told Bond they were &quot;the same&quot;, enraging Bond to the point where he admitted to Scaramanga that &quot;killing you would be a pleasure&quot;. Once in the funhouse, Bond takes the place of a mannequin &quot;James Bond&quot; and tricks Scaramanga into revealing his position to look for Bond with his pistol drawn. Bond shoots Scaramanga in the heart, killing him, while Goodnight inadvertently sabotages the solar power plant which causes the destruction of the island.

In addition, Scaramanga is revealed to have been behind the murder of Bill Fairbanks, MI6 Agent 002, in 1969.

== The Golden Gun ==
In Ian Fleming&#x27;s novel, the Golden Gun was a long-barrelled, gold-plated, single-action Colt Peacemaker .45 calibre revolver that fired silver-jacketed bullets with a solid gold core and a cross-cut tip for additional wounding due to the dum-dum effect. However, in the film, it was a single-shot weapon that fired a custom-made dum-dum bullet made of 23-carat gold with traces of nickel, which Scaramanga carried on his belt buckle. The movie gun could be disassembled and its components disguised as a fountain pen (the barrel), a cigarette lighter (breech), cuff-link (trigger), and a cigarette case (the grip), all gold plated.

Scaramanga used the Golden Gun in numerous assassinations of officials, political enemies, gangsters, and a 00-agent, Bill Fairbanks (002). Scaramanga later used the Golden Gun to kill British scientist Gibson and Scaramanga&#x27;s own employer, Hai-Fat. But, when Scaramanga was killed and his island destroyed, the Golden Gun was presumably also lost.

The Golden Gun ranked sixth in a 2008 20th Century Fox poll of the most popular film weapons, which surveyed approximately two thousand film fans.

In October 2008, the Golden Gun was stolen from the company Elstree Props which is based in Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. At the time, the prop was estimated to be worth £80,000.

== Video games ==
Francisco Scaramanga is a playable character in the multiplayer portions of the 2003 game &quot;007: Nightfire&quot; and the 2010 game &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;. In the original &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; game, Scaramanga&#x27;s weapon, the golden gun, was initially added to the &quot;Egyptian&quot; level and multiplayer portion of the game. It is said in the briefing for the &quot;Egyptian&quot; mission that the Golden Gun was stolen from Scaramanga by Baron Samedi. Also, the multiplayer-only fan remake &quot;&quot; features the weapon as well.

Due to its popularity it was also added into subsequent James Bond games &quot;007: The World is Not Enough&quot;, &quot;007: Agent Under Fire&quot;, &quot;007: Nightfire&quot;, &quot;007: Everything or Nothing&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;007: From Russia With Love&quot;, &quot;007: Quantum of Solace&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;007 Legends&quot;. In &quot;The World is Not Enough&quot; for the Nintendo 64, the gun must be assembled from the pen, lighter, and case before it could be used. In each of the games (except &quot;Everything or Nothing&quot;), the golden gun would count for an instant kill, which reflected that Scaramanga never missed, although in the games the player can and because of this, the golden gun is not available in single player mode (except &quot;Everything or Nothing&quot;) but golden versions of the game&#x27;s standard weapon(s) are usually available (such as a golden Walther PPK, P99, and a golden rocket launcher). In &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, the Golden Gun appears in a special mission. In the mission, the Golden Gun is stolen by Baron Samedi, and Bond needs to defeat Samedi and recover the Golden Gun. Although Samedi is not killed (referencing &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;), Bond escapes with the Golden Gun. Other variants of the Golden Gun also exist, such as the Golden PP7 and the Silver PP7. The Golden Gun also appears in the video game &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;. In &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; the Golden Gun appears to be based on the design on the gun from the novel (a gold-plated revolver), rather than the design used in the film. It is likely to be based on a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 686 in the game. &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, made by &quot;GoldenEye&quot; developer Rareware, also featured a Golden Gun which would count for an instant kill, this time a customized Colt Python revolver belonging to NSA boss Trent Easton.

Francisco Scaramanga returned for the game &quot;&quot; voiced by Christopher Lee. In the game, he is an ally of Auric Goldfinger. He is the manufacturer of the synthetic eye given to the player (GoldenEye) and makes a virus used against Goldfinger&#x27;s O.M.E.N. device. The game also features a Multiplayer &quot;Funhouse&quot; level, including the traps that caused Bond to lose most of his bullets such as Al Capone and Cowboy mannequins and an image of Scaramanga. In addition, the level includes a Bond mannequin, whose gun the player can take and use.

== Reception ==

Francisco Scaramanga was listed at number five in UGO&#x27;s list of the Top 11 Classy Assassins.

Chris Nashawaty of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; argues that Scaramanga is the best villain of the Roger Moore James Bond films.

== In genetics ==
A gene linked to the cause of supernumerary nipples in animals is named the &quot;Scaramanga gene&quot;.

<text>The Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy (also known as Sculptor Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy or the Sculptor Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy, and formerly as the Sculptor System) is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy that is a satellite of the Milky Way. The galaxy lies within the constellation Sculptor. It was discovered in 1937 by American astronomer Harlow Shapley using the 24-inch Bruce refractor at Boyden Observatory. The galaxy is located about 290,000 light-years away from the Solar System. The Sculptor Dwarf contains only 4 percent of the carbon and other heavy elements in our own galaxy, the Milky Way, making it similar to primitive galaxies seen at the edge of the universe.

==Metallicity==
The metallicity of Sculptor dwarf appears to be broken up into two distinct groups, one with [Fe/H] = −2.3 and the other with [Fe/H] = −1.5. Similar to many of the other Local Group galaxies, the older metal-poor segment appears more extended than the younger metal-rich segment. Using cosmological numerical simulations, it has been recently argued that Sculptor&#x27;s two distinct stellar populations would be the tell-tale sign of a past merger between Sculptor and another small dwarf galaxy companion. 

The Sculptor Dwarf is home to the most metal-poor star outside of the Milky Way, known as AS0039, with a metallicity of [Fe/H] = −4.11. Unlike other known metal-poor stars, it has a low carbon abundance and an unusual ratio of alpha elements, suggesting it may have been formed in the aftermath of a Population III star hypernova.

==Measurements==
Using both Hubble Space Telescope and &quot;Gaia&quot; observations 12 years apart, about 100 stars in the galaxy were mapped accurately, and 3D motions of about 10 of those stars enable trajectories to be mapped as well.

<doc id="1244500" wikidata="Q4872262" url="?curid=1244500" title="Battle of Samothrace (1698)">
<text>The Battle of Samothrace was an inconclusive battle which took place on 20 September 1698 near the island of Samothrace, during the Sixth Ottoman–Venetian War. It was fought between Venice on one side, and the Ottoman Empire with its Tripolitanian and Tunisian vassals on the other. Venetian casualties were 299 killed and 622 wounded. Although it resulted in a stalemate, the Battle of Samothrace is notable as the last significant battle of the Great Turkish War.

== Background ==
The Venetian fleet, headed by a new Captain General of the Sea, Giacomo Corner, along with the Piero Duodo and the Daniele Dolfin, sailed from its base at Nauplia on 13 June 1698. It comprised 27 sailing ships and 3 fireships but no galleys, as a result of which Dolfin, who normally would have headed the galleys, was placed in charge of the sailing fleet. Aiming to bring the Ottoman fleet to battle as soon as possible, the fleet made for the northern Aegean. 

The Venetians raided Lemnos on 26 June before making for Imbros, where the galleys joined the rest of the fleet in anchorage, but it was not until 17 July that the first Ottoman ships were spotted at the mouth of the Dardanelles. The Ottomans made no moves towards the Venetian fleet, so that the latter left Imbros on 1 August and anchored in front of the Dardanelles. Thereupon the Ottomans raised anchor and moved to towards the Venetians, but remained mostly out of range and no engagement ensued, before the Ottoman ships anchored at Tenedos. Similar manoeuvres followed on the following days, as the Ottomans moved towards Imbros, the Venetians closing in, only for both sides to then return to their initial positions. On 16 July Dolfin, sailing before a favourable north wind, chased the Turks back into the Dardanelles; in their haste, the latter wrecked and torched the flagship of the Tripolitanian squadron and had another ship dismasted. On 13 August the Venetians&#x27; allies (Maltese, Papal, and Tuscan galley squadrons) joined them at Imbros, but on 25 July the entire galley force, which had remained idle, left Imbros for Poros. Two days later, the Venetian sailing fleet left for Samothrace.

== Battle ==
On 18 August the Venetian and Ottoman fleets sighted each other off Samothrace, with the Ottomans to windward. The two fleets manoeuvred for the weather gauge, until, on the morning of 20 September, the Ottomans had come up to windward of the Venetian rear. Dolfin resolved to attack by tacking his ships at 15:00, whereupon the combat commenced in a disorderly melée. The Venetians had 20 ships, while the Ottomans 25, along with seven Tripolitanian and Tunisian ones in reserve. 

Dolfin&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Rizzo d&#x27;Oro&quot;, was run into by the &quot;San Lorenzo Giustinian&quot;, lost her mizzen yard and was left among the Ottoman fleet, but was later recovered by the intervention of the two other Venetian flagships, Duodo&#x27;s &quot;Aurora&quot; and Bonvicini&#x27;s &quot;Aquila Valiera&quot;. The stearing gear of the &quot;Amazzone&quot;, which led the Venetian line of battle, was disabled, and she was also for a while surrounded by Ottoman fleets. The battle ended at dusk, without a clear winner: the Venetians lost 299 killed and 622 wounded, of whom 301 had been on the &quot;Rizzo d&#x27;Oro&quot;.

== Aftermath ==
After the battle, the Ottomans retired to the ports of Focchies and Smyrna. The Venetians continued to cruise in the northeastern Aegean in hope of another battle, but in vain, as the Ottomans remained put. In October, Dolfin returned with the sailing ships to Nauplia, marking the end of the campaign.

<text>Balkanabat (), formerly Nebit-Dag and Neftedag, is the administrative centre of Balkan Province, the largest province in Turkmenistan. It lies at the foot of the Balkan Daglary mountain range. Balkanabat is about 450 km west of Ashgabat and 160 km east of the seaport city of Türkmenbaşy. The city layout is a grid of apartment blocks called &quot;kvartal&quot; (quarters). The main streets are Magtymguly, Pervomayskiy and Gurbansoltan eje şaýoly.

==Etymology==
The town was founded in 1933 as Neftedag, meaning &quot;Oil Mountain&quot; (Russian &quot;neft&quot;, &quot;oil&quot;, and Turkmen &quot;dag&quot;, &quot;mountain&quot;), as a settlement along one of the stations of the Trans-Caspian Railway. In 1946, when it was transformed into a city, it was renamed &quot;Nebit-Dag&quot;, also meaning &quot;Oil Mountain&quot;, but this time using the Turkmen word &quot;nebit&quot;. Nebit Dag was renamed Balkanabat (&quot;Balkan&quot; from the name of the Balkan mountains (not to be confused with the Balkan mountains in Bulgaria), &quot;abat&quot; – meaning “settlement” in Persian) in 2001 by decree of former President of Turkmenistan Saparmurat Niyazov.
