<text>Shareholder value is a business term, sometimes phrased as shareholder value maximization. The term expresses the idea that the primary goal for a business is to increase the wealth of its shareholders (owners) by paying dividends and/or causing the company&#x27;s stock price to increase. It became a prominent idea during the 1980s and 1990s, along with the management principle value-based management or managing for value.

==Definition==
The term &quot;shareholder value&quot;, sometimes abbreviated to &quot;SV&quot;, can be used to refer to:
* The market capitalization of a company;
* The view that the primary goal for a company is to increase the wealth of its shareholders (owners) by paying dividends and/or causing the stock price to increase (i.e. the Friedman doctrine introduced in 1970);
* The more specific concept that planned actions by management and the returns to shareholders should outperform certain bench-marks such as the cost of capital concept. In essence, the idea that shareholders&#x27; money should be used to earn a higher return than they could earn themselves by investing in other assets having the same amount of risk. The term in this sense was introduced by Alfred Rappaport in 1986.

For a publicly traded company, shareholder value is the part of its capitalization which is equity as opposed to long-term debt. In the case of only one type of stock, this would roughly be the number of outstanding shares times current shareprice. Things like dividends augment shareholder value while issuing of shares (stock options) lower it. This shareholder value added should be compared to average/required increase in value, making reference to the organizations cost of capital.

For a privately held company, the value of the firm after debt must be estimated using one of several valuation methods, such as discounted cash flow.

==History==
The first modern articulation that shareholder wealth creation is the paramount interest of the management of a company was published in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine in 1962 in an article by the management of a US textile company, Indian Head Mills, whose history can be traced back to the 1820s. The article stated that:The objective of our company is to increase the intrinsic value of our common stock. We are not in business to grow bigger for the sake of size, not to become more diversified, not to make the most or best of anything, not to provide jobs, have the most modern plants, the happiest customers, lead in new product development, or to achieve any other status which has no relation to the economic use of capital. Any or all of these may be, from time to time, a means to our objective, but means and ends must never be confused. We are in business solely to improve the inherent value of the common stockholders&#x27; equity in the company.

Economist Milton Friedman introduced the Friedman doctrine in a 1970 essay for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, entitled &quot;A Friedman Doctrine: The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits&quot;. In it, he argued that a company has no social responsibility to the public or society; its only responsibility is to its shareholders. The Friedman doctrine was amplified after the publication of an influential 1976 business paper by finance professors Michael C. Jensen and William Meckling, &quot;Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure&quot;, which provided a quantitative economic rationale for maximizing shareholder value.

On August 12, 1981, Jack Welch made a speech at The Pierre Hotel in New York City called &quot;Growing Fast in a Slow-Growth Economy&quot;, which is often acknowledged as the &quot;dawn of the shareholder-value movement&quot;. Welch did not mention the term &quot;shareholder value&quot;, but outlined his beliefs in selling underperforming businesses and cutting costs to increase profits faster than global economic growth. In the United Kingdom in 1983, Brian Pitman became CEO of Lloyds Bank and sought to clarify the governing objective for the company. The following year, he set return on equity as the key measure of financial performance and set a target for every business within the bank to achieve a return that exceeded its cost of equity.

The management consulting firms Stern Stewart, Marakon Associates, and Alcar pioneered value-based management (VBM), also known as managing for value (MFV), in the 1980s based on the academic work of Joel Stern, Dr. Bill Alberts, and Professor Alfred Rappaport. In &quot;Creating Shareholder Value: The New Standard for Business Performance&quot;, published in 1986, Rappaport argued that &quot;the ultimate test of corporate strategy, indeed the only reliable measure, is whether it creates economic value for shareholders&quot;. Other consulting firms including McKinsey and BCG developed VBM approaches. Value-based management became prominent during the late 1980s and 1990s.

In March 2009, Welch criticized parts of the application of this concept, saying he never meant to suggest boosting a company&#x27;s share price should be the main goal of executives. He said managers and investors should not set share price increases as their overarching goal. He added that short-term profits should be allied with an increase in the long-term value of a company. &quot;On the face of it, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world,&quot; he said. &quot;Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy . . . Your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products.&quot; Welch later elaborated on this, clarifying that &quot;my point is, increasing the value of your company in both the short and long term is an outcome of the implementation of successful strategies.&quot;

=== Interpretation ===
During the 1970s, there was an economic crisis caused by stagflation. The stock market had been flat for nearly 12 years and inflation levels had reached double-digits. The Japanese had taken the top spot as the dominant force in auto and high technology manufacturing, a title historically held by American companies. This, coupled with the economic changes noted by Mark Mizruchi and Howard Kimeldorf, brought about the question as to how to fix the current model of management. Though there were contending solutions to resolve these problems (e.g.Theodore Levitt&#x27;s focus on customer value creation and R. Edward Feeman&#x27;s stakeholder management framework), the winner was the Agency Theory developed by Jensen and Meckling.

Mizruchi and Kimeldorf offer an explanation of the rise in prominence of institutional investors and securities analysts as a function of the changing political economy throughout the late 20th century. The crux of their argument is based upon one main idea. The rise in prominence of institutional investors can be credited to three significant forces, namely organized labor, the state and the banks. The roles of these three forces shifted, or were abdicated, in an effort to keep corporate abuse in check. However, &quot;without the internal discipline provided by the banks and external discipline provided by the state and labor, the corporate world has been left to the professionals who have the ability to manipulate the vital information about corporate performance on which investors depend&quot;. This allowed institutional investors and securities analysts from the outside to manipulate information for their own benefit rather than for that of the corporation as a whole.

Though Ashan and Kimeldorf (1990) admit that their analysis of what historically led to the shareholder value model is speculative, their work is well regarded and is built upon the works of some of the premier scholars in the field, namely Frank Dobbin and Dirk Zorn.

As a result of the political and economic changes of the late 20th century, the balance of power in the economy began to shift. Today, &quot;...power depends on the capacity of one group of business experts to alter the incentives of another, and on the capacity of one group to define the interests of another&quot;. As stated earlier, what made the shift to the shareholder value model unique was the ability of those outside the firm to influence the perceived interests of corporate managers and shareholders.

However, Dobbin and Zorn argue that those outside the firm were not operating with malicious intentions. &quot;They conned themselves first and foremost. Takeover specialists convinced themselves that they were ousting inept CEOs. Institutional investors convinced themselves that CEOs should be paid for performance. Analysts convinced themselves that forecasts were a better metric for judging stock price than current profits&quot;. Overall, it was the political and economic landscape of the time that offered the perfect opportunity for professionals outside of firms to gain power and exert their influence in order to drastically change corporate strategy.

The conflation of shareholder value maximization with profit maximization has been criticized by some economists and legal scholars. For example, Oliver Hart and Luigi Zingales argue that corporate directors have a duty to maximize the &quot;welfare&quot; of shareholders, broadly construed, not just their financial interests. Many shareholders are prosocial, and maximizing shareholder value may sometimes mean making business decisions that prioritize the social issues that investors care about, even at the expense of profits. Likewise, Lynn A. Stout writes that shareholder value is not a singular objective, because &quot;different shareholders have different values. Some are long-term investors planning to hold stock for years or decades; others are short-term speculators.&quot;

== Agency theory and shareholder value ==

Agency theory is the study of problems characterized by disconnects between two cooperating parties: a principal and an agent. Agency problems arise in situations where there is a division of labor, a physical or temporal disconnect separating the two parties, or when the principal hires an agent for specialized expertise. In these circumstances, the principal takes on the agent to delegate responsibility to him. Theorists have described the problem as one of &quot;separation and control&quot;: agents cannot be monitored perfectly by the principal, so they may shirk their responsibilities or act out of sync with the principal&#x27;s goals. The information gap and the misalignment of goals between the two parties results in agency costs, which are the sum of the costs to the principal of monitoring, the costs to the agent of bonding with the principal, and the residual loss due to the disconnect between the principal&#x27;s interests and agent&#x27;s decisions.

Lastly, the shareholder value theory seeks to reform the governance of publicly owned firms in order to decrease the principal-agent information gap. The model calls for firms&#x27; boards to be independent from their corporate executives, specifically, for the head of the board to be someone other than the CEO and for the board to be independently chosen. An independent board can best objectively monitor CEO undertakings and risk. Shareholder value also argues in favor of increased financial transparency. By making firms&#x27; finances available to scrutiny, shareholders become more aware of the agent&#x27;s behavior and can make informed choices about with whom to invest.

==Value-based management==

As a management principle, value-based management (VBM), or managing for value (MFV), states that management should first and foremost consider the interests of shareholders when making management decisions. Under this principle, senior executives should set performance targets in terms of delivering shareholder returns (stock price and dividends payments) and managing to achieve them.

The concept of maximizing shareholder value is usually highlighted in opposition to alleged examples of CEO&#x27;s and other management actions which enrich themselves at the expense of shareholders. Examples of this include acquisitions which are dilutive to shareholders, that is, they may cause the combined company to have twice the profits for example but these might have to be split amongst three times the shareholders. Although the legal premise of a publicly traded company is that the executives are obligated to maximize the company&#x27;s profit, this does not imply that executives are legally obligated to maximize shareholder value.

As shareholder value is difficult to influence directly by any manager, it is usually broken down in components, so called value drivers. A widely used model comprises 7 drivers of shareholder value, giving some guidance to managers:
* Revenue
* Operating Margin
* Cash Tax Rate
* Incremental Capital Expenditure
* Investment in Working Capital
* Cost of Capital
* Competitive Advantage Period

Looking at some of these elements also makes it clear that short term profit maximization does not necessarily increase shareholder value. Most notably, the competitive advantage period takes care of this: if a business sells sub-standard products to reduce cost and make a quick profit, it damages its reputation and therefore destroys competitive advantage in the future. The same holds true for businesses that neglect research or investment in motivated and well-trained employees. Shareholders, analysts and the media will usually find out about these issues and therefore reduce the price they are prepared to pay for shares of this business. This more detailed concept therefore gets rid of some of the issues (though not all of them) typically associated with criticism of the shareholder value model.

Based on these seven components, all functions of a business plan and show how they influence shareholder value. A prominent tool for any department or function to prove its value are so called shareholder value maps that link their activities to one or several of these seven components. So, one can find &quot;HR shareholder value maps&quot;, &quot;R&amp;D shareholder value maps&quot;, and so on.

==Criticism==

The sole concentration on shareholder value has been widely criticized, particularly after the 2007–2008 financial crisis. While a focus on shareholder value can benefit the owners of a corporation financially, it does not provide a clear measure of social issues like employment, environmental issues, or ethical business practices. A management decision can maximize shareholder value while lowering the welfare of third parties. Shareholder value coupled with short-termism has also been criticized as lowering the overall rate of economic growth due to reduced business capital accumulation.

It can also disadvantage other stakeholders such as customers. For example, a company may, in the interests of enhancing shareholder value, cease to provide support for old, or even relatively new, products.

Additionally, short term focus on shareholder value can be detrimental to long term shareholder value; the expense of gimmicks that briefly boost a stocks value can have negative impacts on its long term value. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, said that &quot;[...] the obsession with maximizing profits for shareholders has brought us: terrible economic, racial and health inequalities; the catastrophe of climate change.&quot; According to critics, oversimplifying the corporation&#x27;s role has neglected the imperfect world we live in.

=== Criticism for worker devaluation ===

==== Compensation packages ====
Within the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, numerous companies faced lawsuits from current and former employees alike for reducing or withholding workers from accessing benefits in the present or during retirement. The SV model has led to reduced pension support as a means of maximizing profits at the cost of the employees. Some companies have switched matching pension plans monthly to once a year. Critics remain alarmed at the nature of cutting out or underestimating the value of the labor a worker produces for maintaining or raising the value of stock. The reduced benefits are attributed to the trend of the corporate world&#x27;s reduction in investing in non-shareholder constituents because it is not an immediate money producer—the main goal of SV theory.

==== Layoff practices ====
The aforementioned status of workers faces criticism when looking at how this &quot;reduced pension matching&quot; loophole becomes manipulated. If laid off before the pre-pension matching period is complete, there is no compensation. Furthermore, mass layoffs have affected companies in the home headquarters with many jobs either going overseas or being hired out to contractors from similar positions to those that were laid off for lower benefits and protections as critics and experts have noted. According to economic experts and critics alike, the downsize-and-distribute model invoked by SV theory extracts value and then further ingrains employee instability and greater income inequality.

=== Company criticisms ===

==== End of corporate responsibility ====
In Milton Friedman&#x27;s seminal piece advocating for shareholder value titled &quot;The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits&quot; makes the argument that the business of business is its business. Friedman&#x27;s postulation suggests that if social responsibility and profit run counterintuitive, pick the latter. By prioritizing the accumulation of wealth by all means, it uncomplicated other responsibilities that may have a hindrance to achieving this goal. Some responsibilities include, but are not limited to: community development, employee investment, worker benefits, research and development, and more. These responsibilities are attributed to being long term and do not immediately satisfy the short term – and mainstream – interpretation of shareholder value.

==== Stock buyback ====

Stock buyback is criticized for its extractive nature which takes profit and uses it to make stocks look more profitable than they might be in the name of shareholder value. In 1982, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) implemented Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act, thus allowing for corporations to buy back stock under certain thresholds and circumstances. With low investigation and consequence rates for breaches, as well as loopholes, this opened up opportunity to legal stock price manipulation. With SV theory incentivizing the shareholder and tying executive pay, the stock price became intrinsically tied with success as critics note. One notable effect of this practice includes reduced investment. From 2003 to 2012, of the 449 firms in the S&amp;P 500, 54% of earnings went to stock buyback and 37% to dividends. This leaves 9% of earnings to go elsewhere, a reduction from the previous rates of investment in past decades. Economists like Lenore Palladino point out the eventual consequence when this bubble will burst, the majority of Americans will face the consequence, not the ones leading the firms.

=== Anthropological criticisms ===

==== Under-emphasis of corporate entity ====
Peter Drucker, author of &quot;The Concept of the Corporation&quot;, makes the argument that shareholder value in fact serves to underplay the important social role which corporations occupy in contemporary society. Drucker states &quot;In the social reality of today, shareholders are but one of several groups of people who stand in a special relationship to the corporation.  The corporation is permanent, the share-holder is transitory. It might even be said without much exaggeration that the corporation is really socially and politically a priori, whereas the share-holder&#x27;s position is derivative and exists only in contemplation of law&quot;. Drucker&#x27;s argument is expanded upon by anthropologist Karen Ho, who notes that in the immediate period following the second world war, the corporation existed primarily as a social institution which largely accepted its responsibilities to those involved in its operations outside of shareholders, concerning itself with the longevity and well-being of the corporation as an institution even if this meant undertaking actions that may run counter to the immediate concerns of the corporation&#x27;s shareholders. This post-war outlook is contrasted by the attitude adopted by management of modern-day corporations, which according to former WebTV CEO Randy Komisar see themselves not as institutional stewards but rather as investors themselves. Critics such as Ho believe that the shift of management attitude towards treating corporations as investments has led to the decline of the corporation as a social entity, and allows corporate management to make decisions that may be against the interests of the corporation&#x27;s social stakeholders or even longevity of the corporation itself.

=== Economic criticisms ===

==== Failure of accurate modelling within neoclassical economics ====
The failure of the corporation to readily fit within the neo-classical economic model which dominates contemporary economics academia and policy is a frequently-targeted flaw by critics. Anthropologist Karen Ho argues that the concept of shareholders and subsequently shareholder value was developed primarily for the purpose of shoehorning the insertion of the corporation into the neoclassical economic model, and ignores that the neoclassical model, which was originally created in eighteenth and nineteenth century prior to the proliferation of corporate organization, was never designed to operate with number of inputs the modern corporation requires. Ho claims that advocates of neoclassical proprietorship ran directly counter to the limited-input &quot;owner and property&quot; intentions of influential founding figures of neoclassical economics such as Adam Smith, and that the neoclassical economic model hinges on the idea of the owner-entrepreneur being directly involved in the management and operation of their enterprise. As the modern shareholder typically has very limited or no connection to the regular operations of a corporation they have invested in, the shareholder does not fit within the owner-entrepreneur role required by the neoclassical economic model. Adam Smith himself noted his belief that managed corporations were not viable due to this issue, stating &quot;The directors of [joint stock] companies, however, being the managers rather of other people&#x27;s money than of their own, it cannot well be expected that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own&quot;. Critics such as Ho and Smith believe that failure of the shareholder model to accurately represent the key neoclassical owner-entrepreneur concept is a foundational issue of the neoclassical economic model, leading to an inaccurate assumption that corporate interest remained identical to shareholder interest.

=== Legal criticisms ===
A common critique of shareholder value is the mystification surrounding its legal validity. It is often espoused that shareholders are the owners. This status as a shareholder comes with an assumed legal claim of all profits after contractual obligations have been fulfilled and that they have the ability to decide the structure of the corporation on the board level however they want. Yet, none of these are rooted in any law because shareholder value is ultimately a management decision, not a legal requirement. Corporations are their own legal entity and shareholders simply hold shares, making them equal stakeholders to employees, suppliers, and more. They only get guaranteed full access to residual funds in the case of liquidation. Otherwise, the firm has all control of how to do things as they please like investing into the company, raising salaries, etc. And when it comes to the shareholder supremacy over structure, the ability is flimsy and hard to use. The few cases in which legal action can be taken is when a director is explicitly stealing. In spite of the reality of shareholder obligation and abilities, corporate America has convinced itself, according to legal critiques, that there is a legal duty to their shareholders.

==Disadvantages of the shareholder value model==
Shareholder value may be detrimental to a company&#x27;s worth. When all of a company&#x27;s focus and strategy is concentrated on increasing share prices, the practice and ethics of the firm can become lost because of the following problems with the shareholder value model.

===Increased risk===
In the shareholder value model, companies often take on much more risk than they otherwise would. The acquisition of debt makes the company unstable and at risk of bankruptcy. Plentiful debt is conducive to increasing share value because the company has greater potential to increase value when starting at a lower baseline. This however is a detrimental to the stability of the company.

====Debt financing====

Debt financing, or the purposeful acquisition of debt, causes the debt to equity ratio of the company to rise. Without shareholder value, this would normally be considered negative because it means that the company is not making money. In the shareholder value system, high debt to equity ratios are considered an indicator that the company has confidence to make money in the future. Therefore, debt is not something to avoid but rather something to embrace and having debt will actually gain the company investors. Taking on large risk attracts investors and increases potential value gain, but puts the company in danger of bankruptcy and collapse.

=== Executive compensation ===

In order to facilitate an incentive structure that supports shareholder value, the method of executive compensation has changed toward making a large portion of C-suite pay come from stock. The reasoning behind this decision was that it would bring the interests of CEOs in line with those of shareholders. As a result of this decision, executive compensation has skyrocketed, quadrupling from the rate of compensation in the early 1970s. This change has also shifted the motivations of C-suite managers in the direction of increasing share price over everything else, leaving other goals like long-term growth and stakeholders like employees and customers behind. Share repurchasing might cause misaligned incentives between market capitalization and executive compensation connected to share price due to the change in number of shares.

===Short-term strategy===
The short-term nature of shareholder value theory is one of the features focused on by critics. They argue that this fixation on the short term leads to neglect of more profitable long-term strategies. In this way, shareholder value fails to attain the level of overall capital growth that might otherwise be expected. Given the emphasis on stock price inherent to shareholder value, incentives are created for corporations to inflate their stock price before its value becomes critical for assessment. One such incentive is that the compensation of executives and managers is increasingly tied to stock value through executive bonuses and stock options. Corporations use several gimmicks to increase stock price, perhaps the most infamous being the mass layoffs of employees which creates the appealing image of increased efficiency and lower operating costs, in turn driving up stock price. However, this and other such gimmicks have several negative consequences. Oftentimes, in the wake of mass layoffs, corporations have to refill some of the positions now vacant. This leads to a longer term inefficiency as new employees must be trained and the resources invested into the original employee (provided they were not rehired) are permanently lost.

A related criticism of shareholder value is the reliance on the process of assessing stock, which is itself vulnerable to manipulation and speculation. Speculating on the firm&#x27;s stock price is in the interest of managers that receive stock compensation and may therefore cause them to focus on speculating on the stock price rather than maximizing real production.

Management experts also cite another criticism of shareholder value&#x27;s short-term view, namely that it creates a corporate culture more concerned with maximizing revenue than with maintaining relationships with employees, customers, or their surrounding communities.

=== Loss of growth and productivity ===
Business experts have criticized shareholder value for failing to materialize economic growth and increased productivity. Despite decades of research and dozens of studies, there is negligible strong evidence that shareholder value theory has produced better results for businesses (studies that did provide evidence of shareholder value being beneficial generally were not able to be replicated; Stout). Since the inception and widespread application of shareholder value theory, returns on invested capital have steadily decreased. One explanation for this trend is reduced investment in innovation. Studies have shown that publicly traded companies (who have a share price) invest about half as much as privately held companies in the United States. Even shareholders have had disappointing results with poor returns on investment and a reduction in the population of publicly traded companies by 40%.

In addition to reduced growth, critics also point to reduced productivity. Shareholder value can have a negative effect on employee morale as the entire mission of the corporation becomes the generation of wealth for shareholders. Because of this reduction of motivation, corporations need to engage in more top-down and control-oriented management strategies, one such example being the massive rise in the use of non-compete agreements. Despite such efforts (or because of them), low employee morale has negative effects on business. Less motivated employees are less energetic and produce less and are less likely to innovate.

A further inefficiency of shareholder value is the growth of financialization. The financial industry has ballooned in size following the use of shareholder value, largely due to the outsized importance placed upon shareholders by corporations. The large financial sector is a drain on the entire United States economy, costing roughly 300 billion dollars per year. This is because the financial sector does not engage in actual production.

==Alternatives==
While shareholder value is the most common framework for measuring a company&#x27;s success and financial viability, a number of alternatives have been proposed. Indeed, maximizing shareholder value is not always the goal of successful companies.

===Stakeholder value===
The broad idea of &quot;stakeholder value&quot; is the most common basis of alternative frameworks. The intrinsic or extrinsic worth of a business measured by a combination of financial success, usefulness to society, and satisfaction of employees, the priorities determined by the makeup of the individuals and entities that together own the shares and direct the company. This is sometimes referred to as stakeholder value. Stakeholder value heavily relies on corporate social responsibility and long-term financial stability as a core business strategy. Academic Pete Thomas outlines one response which sees the idea of stakeholder management as &quot;a dangerous and illegitimate challenge to shareholder interests&quot;.

The stakeholder value model is prevalent in regions where limited liability laws are not strong. Some companies, choosing to prioritize social responsibility, elect to prioritize the social and financial welfare of employees and suppliers over shareholders; this, in turn, shields shareholders, the owners of the company, from liability when the law would not be lenient should the company engage in poor behavior.

Despite its high potential social benefit, this concept is difficult to implement in practice because of the difficulty of determining equivalent measures for usefulness to society and satisfaction of employees. For instance, how much additional &quot;usefulness to society&quot; should shareholders expect if they were to give up $100 million in shareholder return? In response to this criticism, defenders of the stakeholder value concept argue that employee satisfaction and usefulness to society will ultimately translate into shareholder value.

Another related criticism is that it is difficult to determine how to equitably distribute value to stakeholders. The question of &quot;who deserves what and how much&quot; is a difficult one to answer.

===Social enterprise===

A company may choose to disregard shareholders completely. A social enterprise instead focuses its objectives on goals other than the profitability of its owners; indeed, the constitution of a social enterprise often precludes issuing dividends to shareholders. Social enterprises require significant investment in financial stability and long-term profitability, in the meantime taking very little risk.

Social enterprises manifest themselves in the UK as community interest companies or limited by guarantee. In the United States, California allows companies to incorporate as flexible purpose corporations.

<text>State Road 429 (SR 429), also known as the Daniel Webster Western Beltway or Western Expressway south of US 441, and the Wekiva Parkway north of US 441, is a controlled-access toll road built and maintained by the Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX), the Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise, and the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). Its mainline extends from I-4 (SR 400) in Four Corners north to I-4 in Sanford. Control cities are Apopka and Tampa although the control cities for traffic at the entrances at US 441 and north are Orlando, Tampa, and Daytona Beach. SR 429 was originally planned as a western half of SR 417.

==Route description==

SR 429 traverses some of the highest elevations in Orange County and is often within a few miles of the Lake Wales Ridge. It runs along the west side of Greater Orlando, later curving around Apopka, crossing the Wekiva River into Seminole County and connecting with Interstate 4 and Florida State Road 417 to complete a nearly complete ring around the city. The road peaks at Mile Marker 13 where on clear days it is possible to see the skyline of downtown Orlando to the northeast and various portions of Walt Disney World Resort to the southeast.

Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise maintains the portion of the expressway south of Seidel Road, and CFX controls the portion north of the interchange. FDOT controls the portion north of SR 46.

==History==
The highway is named the &quot;Daniel Webster Western Beltway&quot; in honor of Daniel Webster, Florida&#x27;s longest-serving legislator and figure often involved in state transportation issues. Due to various complications in the planning and zoning phases of the roadway, Section B would end up being constructed much later (nearly 15-20 years) than Sections A and C.

===Section A===

Section A is the original section from Florida&#x27;s Turnpike in Ocoee, to US 441 in Apopka. It has a toll plaza in the middle, which was one of the first toll plazas in the Orlando area with open road tolling for users of the E-Pass and related electronic toll collection systems. The road itself was finished in July 2000, temporarily ending at SR 50, and the four-level cloverstack interchange with Florida&#x27;s Turnpike was completed in February 2001. Prior to the reconstruction of the I-4/SR 408 interchange near Downtown Orlando in 2021, this interchange featured the highest ramp in the Orlando area.

SR 429 was planned to continue north from its original US 441 junction, but because the land needed for this proposed SR 429 extension’s right of way was not secured ahead of time, new housing was developed north of the US 441 junction. This forced a change in plans for the extension of SR 429, leading to the re-designation of the northernmost 1.9 miles of what was SR 429 to the newly-created State Road 451 (SR 451) toll road in January 2013. This “new” toll road — with minimal new construction (at its connection with the newly-constructed SR 414/SR 429/SR 451 interchange) — consisted primarily of existing roadway, and in essence, simply re-designated the portion of SR 429 north of its junction with SR 414. In doing so — and in order to continue northward extension of SR 429, the original section of roadway south of SR 414 was rerouted on a track to the west, on a newly constructed section of highway that is dually-designated as both SR 429 and SR 414 toll roads, and extends them both to an interchange with US 441 (SR 500/Orange Blossom Trail) which lies approximately 2.5 miles north-west of the original SR 429/US 441 junction (now the SR 451/US 441 junction). North of this interchange with US-441, the SR 414 designation ends, and the toll road continues under the SR 429 designation. Thus, this rerouting shifted the roadway to the west, allowing it to continue north of US-441 on secured land before turning eastward and rejoining the right-of-way that was planned for construction of the long-awaited Wekiva Parkway. The Wekiva Parkway (section B) would complete the ultimate goal of extending SR 429 northwards to a junction with I-4, and thereby complete a Western Beltway around the Orlando metro area.

===Section B===
Section B, also known as the Wekiva Parkway, is a section of SR 429 connecting from US 441 in Apopka to I-4 in Sanford. It had been under debate for over a decade due to its planned alignment being complicated by the ecologically fragile Wekiva River basin, shifting support from Lake County, and the need to re-align the planned path due to the original route being blocked by residential development to the north of Section A’s northern terminal junction with US-441. In 2004, an agreement was reached for its completion. SR 429 is now linked with SR 417, creating a continuous beltway north of Orlando; however, older plans involved a short drive on I-4 or its collector/distributor roads to reach SR 417.

On May 25, 2011, the Florida Department of Transportation and CFX announced that they were partnering to jointly explore the construction of the Wekiva Parkway extension. The proposed route will extend through Orange, Lake, and Seminole Counties and is estimated to cost $1.8 billion. Officials hope to break ground in 2012, with completion by 2021.

On January 20, 2016, the first stub section from CR 435 (Mount Plymouth Road) near Haas Road in Orange County to SR 46 east of Camp Challenge Road in Lake County opened to traffic and it is the first all-electronic toll road in Central Florida.

On July 27, 2017, the Wekiva Parkway&#x27;s mainline was extended from the US 441 connector road to a new northern terminus at Kelly Park Road.
On March 31, 2018, the Wekiva Parkway&#x27;s mainline was extended from Kelly Park Road to a new northern terminus at SR 46. Along with this, a spur known as SR 453 connecting the Wekiva Parkway with SR 46 near Sorrento was opened in conjunction with the extension. This was the final section of the CFX&#x27;s Section 2 of the road, and the final section of the CFX&#x27;s section altogether. The final section of the Wekiva Parkway between SR 46 and I-4 is under construction and is planned to open in 2023. This section will be constructed and maintained by FDOT.

On May 16, 2022, a section of the Wekiva Parkway between SR 46 near Mount Plymouth to SR 46 just west of Longwood Markham Road in Seminole County opened to traffic. This was the longest section of FDOT&#x27;s section of the highway to open and includes several wildlife crossing bridges.

On August 1, 2022, the northbound lanes of a section of the Wekiva Parkway between SR 46 just west of Longwood Markham Road and SR 46 just west of Orange Boulevard in Seminole County opened to traffic, while the southbound lanes opened to traffic on August 15, 2022.

On October 21, 2022, the ramp from westbound I-4 to southbound SR 429, along with the section of the southbound lanes to SR 46 opened to traffic. This section is in length.

On January 26, 2024, the final segment of the Wekiva Parkway at SR 46 just west of Orange Boulevard in Seminole County to I-4 in Sanford opened to traffic, thus officially completing the entirety of SR 429 and by extension the greater beltway around Greater Orlando, comprising SR 429 along with SR 417.

===Section C===
Section C is the section from Florida&#x27;s Turnpike to I-4 (SR 400) in Four Corners south of Walt Disney World. The section from Florida&#x27;s Turnpike to CR 535 was completed in December 2002. The part from CR 535 south to New Independence Parkway opened December 16, 2005, with the extension to US 192 opening December 23. The Turnpike-maintained section, south of Seidel Road, was on a very tight construction schedule. An extended cold snap required the contractor to push to reach the opening date, although the interchanges at Western Way and Seidel Road were not complete. The Western Way interchange was not scheduled to open until Spring of 2006 to coincide with the opening of the new Expedition Everest ride at Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom. The open road tolling gantry, while located north of US 192, was let for construction with the southern five miles (8 km) and was never intended to be open to traffic in conjunction with the 2005 opening between US 92 and Seidel. The Schofield Road interchange was identified as a future interchange, meaning that on December 23 no interchanges were open between US 192 and New Independence Parkway. Other openings were April 4, 2006 for Western Way, April 12, 2006, for Seidel Road, and December 9, 2006, for the remainder from US 192 south to I-4. The Schofield Road interchange opened in May 2015.

===State Road 414 Phase 2===

During June 2010, construction work began on the westward extension of SR 414. Approximately of SR 429 roadway was demolished and on May 14, 2012, a new interchange opened from SR 429 northbound to SR 414 eastbound and from SR 414 westbound to SR 429 southbound. SR 429 and SR 414 now run concurrently to a new interchange with US 441 near Plymouth where the SR 414 designation ends. The control city is Mount Dora. The road previously signed as SR 429 north of the current SR 414 interchange has been redesignated as SR 451 and has been extended across US 441 to a new northern terminus at Vick Road.

<doc id="1263527" wikidata="Q7330" url="?curid=1263527" title="History of the Jews in Germany">
<text>The history of the Jews in Germany goes back at least to the year 321 CE, and continued through the Early Middle Ages (5th to 10th centuries CE) and High Middle Ages (c. 1000–1299 CE) when Jewish immigrants founded the Ashkenazi Jewish community. The community survived under Charlemagne, but suffered during the Crusades. Accusations of well poisoning during the Black Death (1346–53) led to mass slaughter of German Jews, while others fled in large numbers to Poland. The Jewish communities of the cities of Mainz, Speyer and Worms became the center of Jewish life during medieval times. &quot;This was a golden age as area bishops protected the Jews, resulting in increased trade and prosperity.&quot;

The First Crusade began an era of persecution of Jews in Germany. Entire communities, like those of Trier, Worms, Mainz and Cologne, were slaughtered. The Hussite Wars became the signal for renewed persecution of Jews. The end of the 15th century was a period of religious hatred that ascribed to Jews all possible evils. With Napoleon&#x27;s fall in 1815, growing nationalism resulted in increasing repression. From August to October 1819, pogroms that came to be known as the Hep-Hep riots took place throughout Germany. During this time, many German states stripped Jews of their civil rights. As a result, many German Jews began to emigrate.

From the time of Moses Mendelssohn until the 20th century, the community gradually achieved emancipation, and then prospered.

In January 1933, some 522,000 Jews lived in Germany. After the Nazis took power and implemented their antisemitic ideology and policies, the Jewish community was increasingly persecuted. About 60% (numbering around 304,000) emigrated during the first six years of the Nazi dictatorship. In 1933, persecution of the Jews became an official Nazi policy. In 1935 and 1936, the pace of antisemitic persecution increased. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from participating in education, politics, higher education and industry. On 10 November 1938, the state police and Nazi paramilitary forces orchestrated the Night of Broken Glass (&quot;Kristallnacht&quot;), in which the storefronts of Jewish shops and offices were smashed and vandalized, and many synagogues were destroyed by fire. Only roughly 214,000 Jews were left in Germany proper (1937 borders) on the eve of World War II.

Beginning in late 1941, the remaining community was subjected to systematic deportations to ghettos and, ultimately, to death camps in Eastern Europe. In May 1943, Germany was declared &quot;judenrein&quot; (clean of Jews; also &quot;judenfrei&quot;: free of Jews). By the end of the war, an estimated 160,000 to 180,000 German Jews had been killed by the Nazi regime and their collaborators. A total of about six million European Jews were murdered under the direction of the Nazis, in the genocide that later came to be known as the Holocaust.

After the war, the Jewish community in Germany started to slowly grow again. Beginning around 1990, a spurt of growth was fueled by immigration from the former Soviet Union, so that at the turn of the 21st century, Germany had the only growing Jewish community in Europe, and the majority of German Jews were Russian-speaking. By 2018, the Jewish population of Germany had leveled off at 116,000, not including non-Jewish members of households; the total estimated enlarged population of Jews living in Germany, including non-Jewish household members, was close to 225,000.

By German law, denial of the Holocaust or that six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust (§ 130 StGB) is a criminal act; violations can be punished with up to five years of prison. In 2006, on the occasion of the World Cup held in Germany, the then-Interior Minister of Germany Wolfgang Schäuble, urged vigilance against far-right extremism, saying: &quot;We will not tolerate any form of extremism, xenophobia, or antisemitism.&quot; In spite of Germany&#x27;s measures against these groups and antisemites, a number of incidents have occurred in recent years.

== From Rome to the Crusades ==

Jewish migration from Roman Italy is considered the most likely source of the first Jews on German territory. There were Jews in Rome as early as 139 BCE. While the date of the first settlement of Jews in the regions which the Romans called Germania Superior, Germania Inferior, and Magna Germania is not known, the first authentic document relating to a large and well-organized Jewish community in these regions dates from 321 CE and refers to Cologne on the Rhine. It indicates that the legal status of the Jews there was the same as elsewhere in the Roman Empire. They enjoyed some civil liberties, but were restricted regarding the dissemination of their culture, the keeping of non-Jewish slaves, and the holding of office under the government.

Jews were otherwise free to follow any occupation open to indigenous Germans and were engaged in agriculture, trade, industry, and gradually money-lending. These conditions at first continued in the subsequently established Germanic kingdoms under the Burgundians and Franks, for ecclesiasticism took root slowly. The Merovingian rulers who succeeded to the Burgundian empire were devoid of fanaticism and gave scant support to the efforts of the Church to restrict the civic and social status of the Jews.

Charlemagne (800–814) readily made use of the Roman Catholic Church for the purpose of infusing coherence into the loosely joined parts of his extensive empire, but was not by any means a blind tool of the canonical law. He employed Jews for diplomatic purposes, sending, for instance, a Jew as interpreter and guide with his embassy to Harun al-Rashid. Yet, even then, a gradual change occurred in the lives of the Jews. The Church forbade Christians to be usurers, so the Jews secured the remunerative monopoly of money-lending. This decree caused a mixed reaction of people in general in the Carolingian Empire (including Germany) to the Jews: Jewish people were sought everywhere, as well as avoided. This ambivalence about Jews occurred because their capital was indispensable, while their business was viewed as disreputable. This curious combination of circumstances increased Jewish influence, and Jews went about the country freely, settling also in the eastern portions (Old Saxony and Duchy of Thuringia). Aside from Cologne, the earliest communities were established in Mainz, Worms, Speyer, Regensburg, and Aachen

The status of the German Jews remained unchanged under Charlemagne&#x27;s successor, Louis the Pious. Jews were unrestricted in their commerce; however, they paid somewhat higher taxes into the state treasury than did the non-Jews. A special officer, the &quot;Judenmeister&quot;, was appointed by the government to protect Jewish privileges. The later Carolingians, however, followed the demands of the Church more and more. The bishops continually argued at the synods for including and enforcing decrees of the canonical law, with the consequence that the majority Christian populace mistrusted the Jewish populace. This feeling, among both princes and people, was further stimulated by the attacks on the civic equality of the Jews. Beginning with the 10th century, Holy Week became more and more a period of antisemitic activities. Jews in Germany could read and understand the Hebrew prayers and the Bible in the original text. Halakhic studies began to flourish about 1000.

At that time, Rav Gershom ben Judah was teaching at Metz and Mainz, gathering about him pupils from far and near. He is described in Jewish historiography as a model of wisdom, humility, and piety, and became known to succeeding generations as the &quot;Light of the Exile&quot;. In highlighting his role in the religious development of Jews in the German lands, &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; (1901–1906) draws a direct connection to the great spiritual fortitude later shown by the Jewish communities in the era of the Crusades:

He first stimulated the German Jews to study the treasures of their religious literature. This continuous study of the Torah and the Talmud produced such a devotion to Judaism that the Jews considered life without their religion not worth living; but they did not realize this clearly until the time of the Crusades, when they were often compelled to choose between life and faith.

=== Cultural and religious centre of European Jewry ===

The Jewish communities of the cities of Speyer, Worms, and Mainz formed the league of cities which became the center of Jewish life during medieval times. These are referred to as the ShUM cities, after the first letters of the Hebrew names: Shin for Speyer (&quot;Shpira&quot;), Waw for Worms (&quot;Varmaisa&quot;) and Mem for Mainz (&quot;Magentza&quot;). The &quot;Takkanot Shum&quot; ( &quot;Enactments of ShUM&quot;) were a set of decrees formulated and agreed upon over a period of decades by their Jewish community leaders. The official website for the city of Mainz states:

Historian John Man describes Mainz as &quot;the capital of European Jewry&quot;, noting that Gershom ben Judah &quot;was the first to bring copies of the Talmud to Western Europe&quot; and that his directives &quot;helped Jews adapt to European practices.&quot; Gershom&#x27;s school attracted Jews from all over Europe, including the famous biblical scholar Rashi; and &quot;in the mid-14th century, it had the largest Jewish community in Europe: some 6,000.&quot; &quot;In essence,&quot; states the City of Mainz web site, &quot;this was a golden age as area bishops protected the Jews resulting in increased trade and prosperity.&quot;

== A period of massacres (1096–1349) ==
The First Crusade began an era of persecution of Jews in Germany, especially in the Rhineland. The communities of Trier, Worms, Mainz, and Cologne, were attacked. The Jewish community of Speyer was saved by the bishop, but 800 were slain in Worms. About 12,000 Jews are said to have perished in the Rhenish cities alone between May and July 1096. Alleged crimes, like desecration of the host, ritual murder, poisoning of wells, and treason, brought hundreds to the stake and drove thousands into exile.

Jews were alleged to have caused the inroads of the Mongols, though they suffered equally with the Christians. Jews suffered intense persecution during the Rintfleisch massacres of 1298. In 1336 Jews from Alsace were subjected to massacres by the outlaws of Arnold von Uissigheim.

When the Black Death swept over Europe in 1348–49, some Christian communities accused Jews of poisoning wells. Compared to the south and west of the Holy Roman Empire, the persecutions appear to have brought less drastic effects in the eastern parts of the Holy Roman Empire. Nonetheless, in the Erfurt Massacre of 1349, the members of the entire Jewish community were murdered or expelled from the city, due to superstitions about the Black Death. Many persecutions were clearly favoured by a royal throne crisis and the Wittelsbach-Luxembourg dualism, therefore recent German research proposed the term “Thronkrisenverfolgungen” (throne crisis persecutions). Royal policy and public ambivalence towards Jews helped the persecuted Jews fleeing to the East from the German-speaking lands to form the foundations of what would become the largest Jewish community in all of Europe.

== In the Holy Roman Empire ==


The legal and civic status of the Jews underwent a transformation under the Holy Roman Empire. Jewish people found a certain degree of protection with the Holy Roman Emperor, who claimed the right of possession and protection of all the Jews of the empire. A justification for this claim was that the Holy Roman Emperor was the successor of the emperor Titus, who was said to have acquired the Jews as his private property. The German emperors apparently claimed this right of possession more for the sake of taxing the Jews than of protecting them.

A variety of such taxes existed. Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, was a prolific creator of new taxes. In 1342, he instituted the &quot;golden sacrificial penny&quot; and decreed that every year all the Jews should pay the emperor one kreutzer out of every florins of their property in addition to the taxes they were already paying to both the state and municipal authorities. The emperors of the House of Luxembourg devised other means of taxation. They turned their prerogatives in regard to the Jews to further account by selling at a high price to the princes and free towns of the empire the valuable privilege of taxing and fining the Jews. Charles IV, via the Golden Bull of 1356, granted this privilege to the seven electors of the empire when the empire was reorganized in 1356.

From this time onward, for reasons that also apparently concerned taxes, the Jews of Germany gradually passed in increasing numbers from the authority of the emperor to that of both the lesser sovereigns and the cities. For the sake of sorely needed revenue, the Jews were now invited, with the promise of full protection, to return to those districts and cities from which they had shortly before been expelled. However, as soon as Jewish people acquired some property, they were again plundered and driven away. These episodes thenceforth constituted a large portion of the medieval history of the German Jews. Emperor Wenceslaus was particularly skilled at transferring gold from wealthier Jews to his own coffers. He entered compacts with many cities, estates, and princes whereby he annulled all outstanding debts to the Jews in return for a certain sum paid to him. Emperor Wenceslaus declared that anyone helping Jews with the collection of their debts, in spite of this annulment, would be dealt with as a robber and peacebreaker, and be forced to make restitution. This decree, which is believed to have impaired the public availability of credit was also reported to have impoverished thousands of Jewish families near the close of the 14th century.

The 15th century did not bring any amelioration. What happened in the time of the Crusades happened again. The war upon the Hussites became the signal for renewed persecution of Jews. The Jews of Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia passed through all the terrors of death, forced baptism, or voluntary self-immolation for the sake of their faith. When the Hussites made peace with the Church, the Pope sent the Franciscan friar John of Capistrano to win the renegades back into the fold and inspire them with loathing for &quot;heresy&quot; and &quot;unbelief&quot;; 41 martyrs were burned in Wrocław alone, and all Jews were forever banished from Silesia. The Franciscan friar Bernardine of Feltre brought a similar fate upon the communities in southern and western Germany. As a consequence of the fictitious confessions extracted under torture from the Jews of Trent, the populace of many cities, especially of Regensburg, fell upon the Jews and massacred them.

The end of the 15th century, which brought a new epoch for the Christian world, brought no relief to the Jews. Jews in Germany remained the victims of a religious hatred that ascribed to them all possible evils. When the established Church, threatened in its spiritual power in Germany and elsewhere, prepared for its conflict with the culture of the German Renaissance, one of its most convenient points of attack was rabbinic literature. At this time, as once before in France, Jewish converts spread false reports in regard to the Talmud, but an advocate of the book arose in the person of Johann Reuchlin, the German humanist, who was the first one in Germany to include the Hebrew language among the humanities. His opinion, though strongly opposed by the Dominicans and their followers, finally prevailed when the humanistic Pope Leo X permitted the Talmud to be printed in Italy.

=== Moses Mendelssohn ===
Though reading German books was forbidden in the 1700s by Jewish inspectors who had a measure of police power in Germany, Moses Mendelson found his first German book, an edition of Protestant theology, at a well-organized system of Jewish charity for needy Talmud students. Mendelssohn read this book and found proof of the existence of God – his first meeting with a sample of European letters. This was only the beginning to Mendelssohn&#x27;s inquiries about the knowledge of life. Mendelssohn learned many new languages, and with his whole education consisting of Talmud lessons, he thought in Hebrew and translated for himself every new piece of work he met into this language. The divide between the Jews and the rest of society was caused by a lack of translation between these two languages, and Mendelssohn translated the Torah into German, bridging the gap between the two; this book allowed Jews to speak and write in German, preparing them for participation in German culture and secular science. In 1750, Mendelssohn began to serve as a teacher in the house of Isaac Bernhard, the owner of a silk factory, after beginning his publications of philosophical essays in German. Mendelssohn conceived of God as a perfect Being and had faith in &quot;God&#x27;s wisdom, righteousness, mercy, and goodness.&quot; He argued, &quot;the world results from a creative act through which the divine will seeks to realize the highest good,&quot; and accepted the existence of miracles and revelation as long as belief in God did not depend on them. He also believed that revelation could not contradict reason. Like the deists, Mendelssohn claimed that reason could discover the reality of God, divine providence, and immortality of the soul. He was the first to speak out against the use of excommunication as a religious threat. At the height of his career, in 1769, Mendelssohn was publicly challenged by a Christian apologist, a Zurich pastor named John Lavater, to defend the superiority of Judaism over Christianity. From then on, he was involved in defending Judaism in print. In 1783, he published &quot;Jerusalem, or On Religious Power and Judaism&quot;. Speculating that no religious institution should use coercion and emphasized that Judaism does not coerce the mind through dogma, he argued that through reason, all people could discover religious philosophical truths, but what made Judaism unique was its revealed code of legal, ritual, and moral law. He said that Jews must live in civil society, but only in a way that their right to observe religious laws is granted, while also recognizing the needs for respect, and multiplicity of religions. He campaigned for emancipation and instructed Jews to form bonds with the gentile governments, attempting to improve the relationship between Jews and Christians while arguing for tolerance and humanity. He became the symbol of the Jewish Enlightenment, the Haskalah.

Early 19th century
In the late 18th century, a youthful enthusiasm for new ideals of religious equality began to take hold in the western world. Austrian Emperor Joseph II was foremost in espousing these new ideals. As early as 1782, he issued the &quot;Patent of Toleration for the Jews of Lower Austria&quot;, thereby establishing civic equality for his Jewish subjects.

Before 1806, when general citizenship was largely nonexistent in the Holy Roman Empire, its inhabitants were subject to varying estate regulations. In different ways from one territory of the empire to another, these regulations classified inhabitants into different groups, such as dynasts, members of the court entourage, other aristocrats, city dwellers (burghers), Jews, Huguenots (in Prussia a special estate until 1810), free peasants, serfs, peddlers and Gypsies, with different privileges and burdens attached to each classification. Legal inequality was the principle.

The concept of citizenship was mostly restricted to cities, especially Free Imperial Cities. No general franchise existed, which remained a privilege for the few, who had inherited the status or acquired it when they reached a certain level of taxed income or could afford the expense of the citizen&#x27;s fee (&quot;Bürgergeld&quot;). Citizenship was often further restricted to city dwellers affiliated to the locally dominant Christian denomination (Calvinism, Roman Catholicism, or Lutheranism). City dwellers of other denominations or religions and those who lacked the necessary wealth to qualify as citizens were considered to be mere inhabitants who lacked political rights, and were sometimes subject to revocable residence permits.

Most Jews then living in those parts of Germany that allowed them to settle were automatically defined as mere indigenous inhabitants, depending on permits that were typically less generous than those granted to gentile indigenous inhabitants (&quot;Einwohner&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Bürger&quot;, or citizen). In the 18th century, some Jews and their families (such as Daniel Itzig in Berlin) gained equal status with their Christian fellow city dwellers, but had a different status from noblemen, Huguenots, or serfs. They often did not enjoy the right to freedom of movement across territorial or even municipal boundaries, let alone the same status in any new place as in their previous location.

With the abolition of differences in legal status during the Napoleonic era and its aftermath, citizenship was established as a new franchise generally applying to all former subjects of the monarchs. Prussia conferred citizenship on the Prussian Jews in 1812, though this by no means resulted in full equality with other citizens. Jewish emancipation did not eliminate all forms of discrimination against Jews, who often remained barred from holding official state positions. The German federal edicts of 1815 merely held out the prospect of full equality, but it was not genuinely implemented at that time, and even the promises which had been made were modified. However, such forms of discrimination were no longer the guiding principle for ordering society, but a violation of it. In Austria, many laws restricting the trade and traffic of Jewish subjects remained in force until the middle of the 19th century in spite of the patent of toleration. Some of the crown lands, such as Styria and Upper Austria, forbade any Jews to settle within their territory; in Bohemia, Moravia, and Austrian Silesia many cities were closed to them. The Jews were also burdened with heavy taxes and imposts.

In the German Kingdom of Prussia, the government materially modified the promises made in the disastrous year of 1813. The promised uniform regulation of Jewish affairs was time and again postponed. In the period between 1815 and 1847, no less than 21 territorial laws affecting Jews in the older eight provinces of the Prussian state were in effect, each having to be observed by part of the Jewish community. At that time, no official was authorized to speak in the name of all Prussian Jews, or Jewry in most of the other 41 German states, let alone for all German Jews.

Nevertheless, a few men came forward to promote their cause, foremost among them being Gabriel Riesser (d. 1863), a Jewish lawyer from Hamburg, who demanded full civic equality for his people. He won over public opinion to such an extent that this equality was granted in Prussia on 6 April 1848, in Hanover and Nassau on 5 September and on 12 December, respectively, and also in his home state of Hamburg, then home to the second-largest Jewish community in Germany. In Württemberg, equality was conceded on 3 December 1861; in Baden on 4 October 1862; in Holstein on 14 July 1863; and in Saxony on 3 December 1868. After the establishment of the North German Confederation by the law of 3 July 1869, all remaining statutory restrictions imposed on the followers of different religions were abolished; this decree was extended to all the states of the German empire after the events of 1870.

=== The Jewish Enlightenment ===

During the General Enlightenment (the 1600s to late 1700s), many Jewish women began to frequently visit non-Jewish salons and to campaign for emancipation. In Western Europe and the German states, observance of Jewish law, &quot;Halacha&quot;, started to be neglected. In the 18th century, some traditional German scholars and leaders, such as the doctor and author of &quot;Ma&#x27;aseh Tuviyyah&quot;, Tobias b. Moses Cohn, appreciated the secular culture. The most important feature during this time was the German &quot;Aufklärung&quot;, which was able to boast of native figures who competed with the finest Western European writers, scholars, and intellectuals. Aside from the externalities of language and dress, the Jews internalized the cultural and intellectual norms of German society. The movement, becoming known as the German or Berlin Haskalah offered many effects to the challenges of German society. As early as the 1740s, many German Jews and some individual Polish and Lithuanian Jews had a desire for secular education. The German-Jewish Enlightenment of the late 18th century, the &quot;Haskalah&quot;, marks the political, social, and intellectual transition of European Jewry to modernity. Some of the elite members of Jewish society knew European languages. Absolutist governments in Germany, Austria, and Russia deprived the Jewish community&#x27;s leadership of its authority and many Jews became &#x27;Court Jews&#x27;. Using their connections with Jewish businessmen to serve as military contractors, managers of mints, founders of new industries and providers to the court of precious stones and clothing, they gave economic assistance to the local rulers. Court Jews were protected by the rulers and acted as did everyone else in society in their speech, manners, and awareness of European literature and ideas. Isaac Euchel, for example, represented a new generation of Jews. He maintained a leading role in the German &quot;Haskalah&quot;, is one of the founding editors of &quot;Ha-Me/assef&quot;. Euchel was exposed to European languages and culture while living in Prussian centers: Berlin and Koenigsberg. His interests turned towards promoting the educational interests of the Enlightenment with other Jews. Moses Mendelssohn as another enlightenment thinker was the first Jew to bring secular culture to those living an Orthodox Jewish life. He valued reason and felt that anyone could arrive logically at religious truths while arguing that what makes Judaism unique is its divine revelation of a code of law. Mendelssohn&#x27;s commitment to Judaism leads to tensions even with some of those who subscribed to Enlightenment philosophy. Faithful Christians who were less opposed to his rationalistic ideas than to his adherence to Judaism found it difficult to accept this &quot;Juif de Berlin.&quot; In most of Western Europe, the &quot;Haskalah&quot; ended with large numbers of Jews assimilating. Many Jews stopped adhering to Jewish law, and the struggle for emancipation in Germany awakened some doubts about the future of Jews in Europe and eventually led to both immigrations to America and Zionism. In Russia, antisemitism ended the&quot; Haskalah&quot;. Some Jews responded to this antisemitism by campaigning for emancipation, while others joined revolutionary movements and assimilated, and some turned to Jewish nationalism in the form of the Zionist Hibbat Zion movement.
=== Reorganization of the German Jewish community ===

Abraham Geiger and Samuel Holdheim were two founders of the conservative movement in modern Judaism who accepted the modern spirit of liberalism. Samson Raphael Hirsch defended traditional customs, denying the modern &quot;spirit&quot;. Neither of these beliefs was followed by the faithful Jews. Zecharias Frankel created a moderate reform movement in assurance with German communities. Public worships were reorganized, reduction of medieval additions to the prayer, congregational singing was introduced, and regular sermons required scientifically trained rabbis. Religious schools were enforced by the state due to a want for the addition of religious structure to secular education of Jewish children. Pulpit oratory started to thrive mainly due to German preachers, such as M. Sachs and M. Joel. Synagogal music was accepted with the help of Louis Lewandowski. Part of the evolution of the Jewish community was the cultivation of Jewish literature and associations created with teachers, rabbis, and leaders of congregations.

Another vital part of the reorganization of the Jewish-German community was the heavy involvement of Jewish women in the community and their new tendencies to assimilate their families into a different lifestyle. Jewish women were contradicting their view points in the sense that they were modernizing, but they also tried to keep some traditions alive. German Jewish mothers were shifting the way they raised their children in ways such as moving their families out of Jewish neighborhoods, thus changing who Jewish children grew up around and conversed with, all in all shifting the dynamic of the then close-knit Jewish community. Additionally, Jewish mothers wished to integrate themselves and their families into German society in other ways. Because of their mothers, Jewish children participated in walks around the neighborhood, sporting events, and other activities that would mold them into becoming more like their other German peers. For mothers to assimilate into German culture, they took pleasure in reading newspapers and magazines that focused on the fashion styles, as well as other trends that were up and coming for the time and that the Protestant, bourgeois Germans were exhibiting. Similar to this, German-Jewish mothers also urged their children to partake in music lessons, mainly because it was a popular activity among other Germans. Another effort German-Jewish mothers put into assimilating their families was enforcing the importance of manners on their children. It was noted that non-Jewish Germans saw Jews as disrespectful and unable to grasp the concept of time and place. Because of this, Jewish mothers tried to raise their kids having even better manners than the Protestant children in an effort to combat the pre-existing stereotype put on their children. In addition, Jewish mothers put a large emphasis on proper education for their children in hopes that this would help them grow up to be more respected by their communities and eventually lead to prosperous careers. While Jewish mothers worked tirelessly on ensuring the assimilation of their families, they also attempted to keep the familial aspect of Jewish traditions. They began to look at Shabbat and holidays as less of culturally Jewish days, but more as family reunions of sorts. What was once viewed as a more religious event became more of a social gathering of relatives.

=== Birth of the Reform Movement ===

The beginning of the Reform Movement in Judaism was emphasized by David Philipson, who was the rabbi at the largest Reform congregation. The increasing political centralization of the late 18th and early 19th centuries undermined the societal structure that perpetuated traditional Jewish life. Enlightenment ideas began to influence many intellectuals, and the resulting political, economic, and social changes were overpowering. Many Jews felt a tension between Jewish tradition and the way they were now leading their lives – religiously – resulting in less tradition. As the insular religious society that reinforced such observance disintegrated, falling away from vigilant observance without deliberately breaking with Judaism was easy. Some tried to reconcile their religious heritage with their new social surroundings; they reformed traditional Judaism to meet their new needs and to express their spiritual desires. A movement was formed with a set of religious beliefs, and practices that were considered expected and tradition. Reform Judaism was the first modern response to the Jew&#x27;s emancipation, though reform Judaism differing in all countries caused stresses of autonomy on both the congregation and individual. Some of the reforms were in the practices: circumcisions were abandoned, rabbis wore vests after Protestant ministers, and instrumental accompaniment was used: pipe organs. In addition, the traditional Hebrew prayer book was replaced by German text, and reform synagogues began being called temples which were previously considered the Temple of Jerusalem. Reform communities composed of similar beliefs and Judaism changed at the same pace as the rest of society had. The Jewish people have adapted to religious beliefs and practices to the meet the needs of the Jewish people throughout the generation.

== 1815–1918 ==
Napoleon I emancipated the Jews across Europe, but with Napoleon&#x27;s fall in 1815, growing nationalism resulted in increasing repression. From August to October 1819, pogroms that came to be known as the Hep-Hep riots took place throughout Germany. Jewish property was destroyed in large number.

During this time, many German states stripped Jews of their civil rights. In the Free City of Frankfurt, only 12 Jewish couples were allowed to marry each year, and the 400,000 florins the city&#x27;s Jewish community had paid in 1811 for its emancipation was forfeited. After the Rhineland reverted to Prussian control, Jews lost the rights Napoleon had granted them, were banned from certain professions, and the few who had been appointed to public office before the Napoleonic Wars were dismissed. Throughout numerous German states, Jews had their rights to work, settle, and marry restricted. Without special letters of protection, Jews were banned from many different professions, and often had to resort to jobs considered unrespectable, such as peddling or cattle dealing, to survive. A Jewish man who wanted to marry had to purchase a registration certificate, known as a &quot;Matrikel&quot;, proving he was in a &quot;respectable&quot; trade or profession. A &quot;Matrikel&quot;, which could cost up to 1,000 florins, was usually restricted to firstborn sons. As a result, most Jewish men were unable to legally marry. Throughout Germany, Jews were heavily taxed, and were sometimes discriminated against by gentile craftsmen.

As a result, many German Jews began to emigrate. The emigration was encouraged by German-Jewish newspapers. At first, most emigrants were young, single men from small towns and villages. A smaller number of single women also emigrated. Individual family members would emigrate alone, and then send for family members once they had earned enough money. Emigration eventually swelled, with some German Jewish communities losing up to 70% of their members. At one point, a German-Jewish newspaper reported that all the young Jewish males in the Franconian towns of Hagenbach, Ottingen, and Warnbach had emigrated or were about to emigrate. The United States was the primary destination for emigrating German Jews.

The Revolutions of 1848 swung the pendulum back towards freedom for the Jews. A noted reform rabbi of that time was Leopold Zunz, a contemporary and friend of Heinrich Heine. In 1871, with the unification of Germany by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, came their emancipation, but the growing mood of despair among assimilated Jews was reinforced by the antisemitic penetrations of politics. In the 1870s, antisemitism was fueled by the financial crisis and scandals; in the 1880s by the arrival of masses of &quot;Ostjuden&quot;, fleeing from Russian territories; by the 1890s it was a parliamentary presence, threatening anti-Jewish laws. In 1879 the Hamburg pamphleteer Wilhelm Marr introduced the term &#x27;antisemitism&#x27; into the political vocabulary by founding the Antisemitic League. Antisemites of the &quot;völkisch movement&quot; were the first to describe themselves as such, because they viewed Jews as part of a Semitic race that could never be properly assimilated into German society. Such was the ferocity of the anti-Jewish feeling of the völkisch movement that by 1900, &quot;antisemitic&quot; had entered German to describe anyone who had anti-Jewish feelings. However, despite massive protests and petitions, the völkisch movement failed to persuade the government to revoke Jewish emancipation, and in the 1912 Reichstag elections, the parties with völkisch-movement sympathies suffered a temporary defeat.

Jews experienced a period of legal equality after 1848. Baden and Württemberg passed the legislation that gave the Jews complete equality before the law in 1861–64. The newly formed German Empire did the same in 1871. Historian Fritz Stern concludes that by 1900, what had emerged was a Jewish-German symbiosis, where German Jews had merged elements of German and Jewish culture into a unique new one. Marriages between Jews and non-Jews became somewhat common from the 19th century; for example, the wife of German Chancellor Gustav Stresemann was Jewish. However, opportunity for high appointments in the military, the diplomatic service, judiciary or senior bureaucracy was very small. Some historians believe that with emancipation the Jewish people lost their roots in their culture and began only using German culture. However, other historians including Marion A. Kaplan, argue that it was the opposite and Jewish women were the initiators of balancing both Jewish and German culture during Imperial Germany. Jewish women played a key role in keeping the Jewish communities in tune with the changing society that was evoked by the Jews being emancipated. Jewish women were the catalyst of modernization within the Jewish community. The years 1870–1918 marked the shift in the women&#x27;s role in society. Their job in the past had been housekeeping and raising children. Now, however, they began to contribute to the home financially. Jewish mothers were the only tool families had to linking Judaism with German culture. They felt it was their job to raise children that would fit in with bourgeois Germany. Women had to balance enforcing German traditions while also preserving Jewish traditions. Women were in charge of keeping kosher and the Sabbath; as well as, teaching their children German speech and dressing them in German clothing. Jewish women attempted to create an exterior presence of German while maintaining the Jewish lifestyle inside their homes.

During the history of the German Empire, there were various divisions within the German Jewish community over its future; in religious terms, Orthodox Jews sought to keep to Jewish religious tradition, while liberal Jews sought to &quot;modernise&quot; their communities by shifting from liturgical traditions to organ music and German-language prayers.

Many immigrants travelled through Germany on the way to other countries. By the outbreak of World War I, five million emigrants from Russia had passed through German territory. Around two million Jews passed through the eastern border of Germany between 1880 and 1914 with around 78,000 remaining in Germany.

The Jewish population grew from 512,000 in 1871 to 615,000 in 1910, including 79,000 recent immigrants from Russia, just under one percent of the total. About 15,000 Jews converted to Christianity between 1871 and 1909. The typical attitude of German liberals towards Jews was that they were in Germany to stay and were capable of being assimilated; anthropologist and politician Rudolf Virchow summarised this position, saying &quot;The Jews are simply here. You cannot strike them dead.&quot; This position, however, did not tolerate cultural differences between Jews and non-Jews, advocating instead eliminating this difference.

=== World War I ===

A higher percentage of German Jews fought in World War I than of any other ethnic, religious or political minority in Germany; around 12,000 died in the fighting.

Many German Jews supported the war out of patriotism; like many Germans, they viewed Germany&#x27;s actions as defensive in nature and even left-liberal Jews believed Germany was responding to the actions of other countries, particularly Russia. For many Jews it was never a question as to whether or not they would stand behind Germany, it was simply a given that they would. The fact that the enemy was Russia also gave an additional reason for German Jews to support the war; Tsarist Russia was regarded as the oppressor in the eyes of German Jews for its pogroms and for many German Jews, the war against Russia would become a sort of holy war. While there was partially a desire for vengeance, for many Jews ensuring Russia&#x27;s Jewish population was saved from a life of servitude was equally important – one German-Jewish publication stated &quot;We are fighting to protect our holy fatherland, to rescue European culture and to liberate our brothers in the east.&quot; War fervour was as common amongst Jewish communities as it was amongst ethnic Germans ones. The main Jewish organisation in Germany, the Central Association of German Citizens of the Jewish Faith, declared unconditional support for the war and when 5 August was declared by the Kaiser to be a day of patriotic prayer, synagogues across Germany surged with visitors and filled with patriotic prayers and nationalistic speeches.
While going to war brought the unsavoury prospect of fighting fellow Jews in Russia, France and Britain, for the majority of Jews this severing of ties with Jewish communities in the Entente was accepted part of their spiritual mobilisation for war. After all, the conflict also pitted German Catholics and Protestants against their fellow believers in the east and west. Indeed, for some Jews the fact that Jews were going to war with one another was proof of the normality of German-Jewish life; they could no longer be considered a minority with transnational loyalties but loyal German citizens. German Jews often broke ties with Jews of other countries; the Alliance Israélite Universelle, a French organisation that was dedicated to protecting Jewish rights, saw a German Jewish member quit once the war started, declaring that he could not, as a German, belong to a society that was under French leadership. German Jews supported German colonial ambitions in Africa and Eastern Europe, out of the desire to increase German power and to rescue Eastern European Jews from Tsarist rule. The eastern advance became important for German Jews because it combined German military superiority with rescuing Eastern Jews from Russian brutality; Russian antisemitism and pogroms had only worsened as the war dragged on. However, German Jews did not always feel a personal kinship with Russian Jews. Many were repelled by Eastern Jews, who dressed and behaved differently, as well as being much more religiously devout. Victor Klemperer, a German Jew working for military censors, stated &quot;No, I did not belong to these people, even if one proved my blood relation to them a hundred times over...I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German.&quot; This was a common attitude amongst ethnic Germans however; during the invasion of Russia the territories the Germans overran seemed backwards and primitive, thus for many Germans their experiences in Russia simply reinforced their national self-concept.
Prominent Jewish industrialists and bankers, such as Walther Rathenau and Max Warburg played major roles in supervising the German war economy.

In October 1916, the German Military High Command administered the &quot;Judenzählung&quot; (census of Jews). Designed to confirm accusations of the lack of patriotism among German Jews, the census disproved the charges, but its results were not made public. Denounced as a &quot;statistical monstrosity&quot;, the census was a catalyst to intensified antisemitism and social myths such as the &quot;stab-in-the-back myth&quot; (&quot;Dolchstoßlegende&quot;). For many Jews, the fact the census was carried out at all caused a sense of betrayal, as German Jews had taken part in the violence, food shortages, nationalist sentiment and misery of attrition alongside their fellow Germans, however most German-Jewish soldiers carried on dutifully to the bitter end.

When strikes broke out in Germany towards the end of the war, some Jews supported them. However, the majority of Jews had little sympathy for the strikers and one Jewish newspaper accused the strikers of &quot;stabbing the frontline army in the back.&quot; Like many Germans, German Jews would lament the Treaty of Versailles.

== Weimar years, 1919–33 ==
Under the Weimar Republic, 1919–1933, German Jews played a major role in politics and diplomacy for the first time in their history, and they strengthened their position in financial, economic, and cultural affairs. Hugo Preuß was Interior Minister under the first post-imperial regime and wrote the first draft of the liberal Weimar Constitution. Walther Rathenau, chairman of the General Electricity Company (AEG), served as foreign minister in 1922, when he negotiated the important Treaty of Rapallo. He was assassinated two months later.

In 1914, Jews were well-represented among the wealthy, including 23.7 percent of the 800 richest individuals in Prussia, and eight percent of the university students. Jewish businesses, however, no longer had the economic prominence they had in previous decades. The Jewish middle class suffered increasing economic deprivation, and by 1930 a quarter of the German Jewish community had to be supported through community welfare programs. Germany&#x27;s Jewish community was also highly urbanized, with 80 percent living in cities.

=== Antisemitism ===

There was sporadic antisemitism based on the false allegation that wartime Germany had been betrayed by an enemy within. There was some violence against German Jews in the early years of the Weimar Republic, and it was led by the paramilitary Freikorps. &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; (1920), a forgery which claimed that Jews were taking over the world, was widely circulated. The second half of the 1920s were prosperous, and antisemitism was much less noticeable. When the Great Depression hit in 1929, it surged again as Adolf Hitler and his Nazi party promoted a virulent strain.

Author Jay Howard Geller says that four possible responses were available to the German Jewish community. The majority of German Jews were only nominally religious and they saw their Jewish identity as only one of several identities; they opted for bourgeois liberalism and assimilation into all phases of German culture. A second group (especially recent migrants from eastern Europe) embraced Judaism and Zionism. A third group of left-wing elements endorsed the universalism of Marxism, which downplayed ethnicity and antisemitism. A fourth group contained some who embraced hardcore German nationalism and minimized or hid their Jewish heritage. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, a fifth option was seized upon by hundreds of thousands: escape into exile, typically at the cost of leaving all wealth behind.

The German legal system generally treated Jews fairly throughout the period. The Centralverein, the major organization of German Jewry, used the court system to vigorously defend Jewry against antisemitic attacks across Germany; it proved generally successful.

=== Intellectuals ===

Jewish intellectuals and creative professionals were among the leading figures in many areas of Weimar culture. German university faculties became universally open to Jewish scholars in 1918. Leading Jewish intellectuals on university faculties included physicist Albert Einstein; sociologists Karl Mannheim, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse; philosophers Ernst Cassirer and Edmund Husserl; communist political theorist Arthur Rosenberg; sexologist and pioneering LGBT advocate Magnus Hirschfeld, and many others. Seventeen German citizens were awarded Nobel prizes during the Weimar Republic (1919–1933), five of whom were Jewish scientists. The German-Jewish literary magazine, &quot;Der Morgen&quot;, was established in 1925. It published essays and stories by prominent Jewish writers such as Franz Kafka and Leo Hirsch until its liquidation by the Nazi government in 1938.

== Under the Nazis (1933–45) ==
In Germany, according to historian Hans Mommsen, there were three types of antisemitism. In a 1997 interview, Mommsen was quoted as saying:

One should differentiate between the cultural antisemitism symptomatic of the German conservatives—found especially in the German officer corps and the high civil administration—and mainly directed against the Eastern Jews on the one hand, and &quot;völkisch&quot; antisemitism on the other. The conservative variety functions, as Shulamit Volkov has pointed out, as something of a &quot;cultural code.&quot; This variety of German antisemitism later on played a significant role insofar as it prevented the functional elite from distancing itself from the repercussions of racial antisemitism. Thus, there was almost no relevant protest against the Jewish persecution on the part of the generals or the leading groups within the &quot;Reich&quot; government. This is especially true with respect to Hitler&#x27;s proclamation of the &quot;racial annihilation war&quot; against the Soviet Union.

Besides conservative antisemitism, there existed in Germany a rather silent anti-Judaism within the Catholic Church, which had a certain impact on immunizing the Catholic population against the escalating persecution. The famous protest of the Catholic Church against the euthanasia program was, therefore, not accompanied by any protest against the Holocaust. The third and most vitriolic variety of antisemitism in Germany (and elsewhere) is the so-called &quot;völkisch&quot; antisemitism or racism, and this is the foremost advocate of using violence.

In 1933, persecution of the Jews became an active Nazi policy, but at first laws were not as rigorously obeyed or as devastating as in later years. Such clauses, known as Aryan paragraphs, had been postulated previously by antisemitism and enacted in many private organizations.
The continuing and exacerbating abuse of Jews in Germany triggered calls throughout March 1933 by Jewish leaders around the world for a boycott of German products. The Nazis responded with further bans and boycotts against Jewish doctors, shops, lawyers and stores. Only six days later, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed, banning Jews from being employed in government. This law meant that Jews were now indirectly and directly dissuaded or banned from privileged and upper-level positions reserved for &quot;Aryan&quot; Germans. From then on, Jews were forced to work at more menial positions, beneath non-Jews, pushing them to more labored positions.

The Civil Service Law reached immediately into the education system because university professors, for example, were civil servants. While the majority of the German intellectual classes were not thoroughgoing National Socialists, academia had been suffused with a &quot;cultured antisemitism&quot; since imperial times, even more so during Weimar. With the majority of non-Jewish professors holding such feelings about Jews, coupled with how the Nazis&#x27; outwardly appeared in the period during and after the seizure of power, there was little motivation to oppose the anti-Jewish measures being enacted—few did, and many were actively in favor. According to a German professor of the history of mathematics, &quot;There is no doubt that most of the German mathematicians who were members of the professional organization collaborated with the Nazis, and did nothing to save or help their Jewish colleagues.&quot; &quot;German physicians were highly Nazified, compared to other professionals, in terms of party membership,&quot; observed Raul Hilberg and some even carried out experiments on human beings at places like Auschwitz.

On 2 August 1934, President Paul von Hindenburg died. No new president was appointed; with Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany, he took control of the office of Führer. This, and a tame government with no opposition parties, allowed Adolf Hitler totalitarian control of law-making. The army also swore an oath of loyalty personally to Hitler, giving him power over the military; this position allowed him to enforce his beliefs further by creating more pressure on the Jews than ever before.

In 1935 and 1936, the pace of persecution of the Jews increased. In May 1935, Jews were forbidden to join the Wehrmacht (Armed Forces), and that year, anti-Jewish propaganda appeared in Nazi German shops and restaurants. The Nuremberg Racial Purity Laws were passed around the time of the Nazi rallies at Nuremberg; on 15 September 1935, the Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor was passed, preventing sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews. At the same time the Reich Citizenship Law was passed and was reinforced in November by a decree, stating that all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews, were no longer citizens (&quot;Reichsbürger&quot;) of their own country. Their official status became &quot;Reichsangehöriger&quot;, &quot;subject of the state&quot;. This meant that they had no basic civil rights, such as that to vote, but at this time the right to vote for the non-Jewish Germans only meant the obligation to vote for the Nazi party. This removal of basic citizens&#x27; rights preceded harsher laws to be passed in the future against Jews. The drafting of the Nuremberg Laws is often attributed to Hans Globke.

In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from exerting any influence in education, politics, higher education and industry. Because of this, there was nothing to stop the anti-Jewish actions which spread across the Nazi-German economy.

After the Night of the Long Knives, the Schutzstaffel (SS) became the dominant policing power in Germany. Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler was eager to please Hitler and so willingly obeyed his orders. Since the SS had been Hitler&#x27;s personal bodyguard, its members were far more loyal and skilled than those of the Sturmabteilung (SA) had been. Because of this, they were also supported, though distrusted, by the army, which was now more willing to agree with Hitler&#x27;s decisions than when the SA was dominant. All of this allowed Hitler more direct control over government and political attitude towards Jews in Nazi Germany. In 1937 and 1938, new laws were implemented, and the segregation of Jews from the true &quot;Aryan&quot; German population was started. In particular, Jews were penalized financially for their perceived racial status.

On 4 June 1937, two young German Jews, Helmut Hirsch and Isaac Utting, were both executed for being involved in a plot to bomb the Nazi party headquarters in Nuremberg.

As of 1 March 1938, government contracts could no longer be awarded to Jewish businesses. On 30 September, &quot;Aryan&quot; doctors could only treat &quot;Aryan&quot; patients. Provision of medical care to Jews was already hampered by the fact that Jews were banned from being doctors or having any professional jobs.

Beginning 17 August 1938, Jews with first names of non-Jewish origin had to add Israel (males) or Sarah (females) to their names, and a large J was to be imprinted on their passports beginning 5 October. On 15 November Jewish children were banned from going to normal schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been forced to sell out to the Nazi German government. This further reduced Jews&#x27; rights as human beings. They were in many ways officially separated from the German population.
The increasingly totalitarian, militaristic regime which was being imposed on Germany by Hitler allowed him to control the actions of the SS and the military. On 7 November 1938, a young Polish Jew, Herschel Grynszpan, attacked and shot two German officials in the Nazi German embassy in Paris. (Grynszpan was angry about the treatment of his parents by the Nazis.) On 9 November the German Attache, Ernst vom Rath, who had been shot by Grynszpan, died. Joseph Goebbels issued instructions that demonstrations against Jews were to be organized and undertaken in retaliation throughout Germany. On 10 November 1938, Reinhard Heydrich ordered the state police and the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) to destroy Jewish property and arrest as many Jews as possible in what became known as the Night of Broken Glass (&quot;Kristallnacht&quot;). The storefronts of Jewish shops and offices were smashed and vandalized, and many synagogues were destroyed by fire. Approximately 91 Jews were killed, and another 30,000 arrested, mostly able bodied males, all of whom were sent to the newly formed concentration camps. In the following 3 months some 2,000–2,500 of them died in the concentration camps, the rest were released under the condition that they leave Germany. Many Germans were disgusted by this action when the full extent of the damage was discovered, so Hitler ordered that it be blamed on the Jews. The Nazis announced the &quot;Jewish Capital Levy&quot; (), a one billion Reichsmark tax (equivalent to US$ billion in ). Any Jews owning assets exceeding had to surrender 20% of those assets. The Jews also had to repair all damages at their own cost.
Increasing antisemitism prompted a wave of Jewish mass emigration from Germany throughout the 1930s. Among the first wave were intellectuals, politically active individuals, and Zionists. However, as Nazi legislation worsened the Jews&#x27; situation, more Jews wished to leave Germany, with a panicked rush in the months after Kristallnacht in 1938.

Mandatory Palestine was a popular destination for German Jewish emigration. Soon after the Nazis&#x27; rise to power in 1933, they negotiated the Haavara Agreement with Zionist authorities in Palestine, which was signed on 25 August 1933. Under its terms, 60,000 German Jews were to be allowed to emigrate to Palestine. During the Fifth Aliyah, between 1929 and 1939, a total of 250,000 Jewish immigrants arrived in Palestine—more than 55,000 of them from Germany, Austria, or Bohemia. Many of them were doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects, and other professionals, who contributed greatly to the development of the Yishuv.

The United States was another destination for German Jews seeking to leave the country, though the number allowed to immigrate was restricted due to the Immigration Act of 1924. Between 1933 and 1939, more than 300,000 Germans, of whom about 90% were Jews, applied for immigration visas to the United States. By 1940, only 90,000 German Jews had been granted visas and allowed to settle in the United States. Some 100,000 German Jews also moved to Western European countries, especially France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. However, these countries would later be occupied by Germany, and most of them would still fall victim to the Holocaust. Another 48,000 emigrated to the United Kingdom and other European countries.

=== The Holocaust in Germany ===

Overall, of the 522,000 Jews living in Germany in January 1933, approximately 304,000 emigrated during the first six years of Nazi rule and about 214,000 were left on the eve of World War II. Of these, 160,000–180,000 were killed as a part of the Holocaust. Those that remained in Germany went into hiding and did everything they could to survive. Commonly referred to as &quot;dashers and divers,&quot; the Jews lived a submerged life and experienced the struggle to find food, a relatively secure hiding space or shelter, and false identity papers while constantly evading Nazi police and strategically avoiding checkpoints. Non-Jews offered support by allowing the Jews to hide in their homes but when this proved to be too dangerous for both parties, the Jews were forced to seek shelter in more exposed locations including the street. Some Jews were able to attain false papers, despite the risks and sacrifice of resources doing so required. A reliable false ID would cost between 2,000RM and 6,000RM depending on where it came from. Some Jews in Berlin looked to the Black Market to get false papers as this was a most sought-after product following food, tobacco, and clothing. Certain forms of ID were soon deemed unacceptable, leaving the Jews with depleted resources and vulnerable to being arrested. Avoiding arrest was particularly challenging in 1943 as the Nazi police increased their personnel and inspection checkpoints, leading to 65 percent of all submerged Jews being detained and likely deported. On 19 May 1943, only about 20,000 Jews remained and Germany was declared &quot;judenrein&quot; (clean of Jews; also &quot;judenfrei&quot;: free of Jews).

== Persistence of antisemitism ==
During the medieval period antisemitism flourished in Germany. Especially during the time of the Black Death from 1348 to 1350 hatred and violence against Jews increased. Approximately 72% of towns with a Jewish settlement suffered from violent attacks against the Jewish population.

Regions that suffered from the Black Death pogroms were 6 times more likely to engage in antisemitic violence during the 1920s, racist and fascist parties like the DNVP, NSDAP and DVFP gained a 1.5 times higher voting share in the 1928 election, their inhabitants wrote more letters to antisemitic newspapers like &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;, and they deported more Jews during the Nazi reign. This is due to cultural transmission.

According to a study by Nico Voigtländer and Hans-Joachim Voth, Germans who grew up during Nazi rule are significantly more antisemitic than Germans born before or after them. In addition, Voigtländer and Voth found Nazi antisemitic indoctrination was more effective in areas with pre-existing widespread antisemitism.

A simple model of cultural transmission and persistence of attitudes comes from Bisin and Verdier, who state that children acquire their preference scheme through imitating their parents, who in turn attempt to socialize their children to their own preferences, without taking into consideration if these traits are useful or not.

Economic factors had the potential to undermine this persistence throughout the centuries. Hatred against outsiders was more costly in trade open cities, like the members of the Hanseatic League. Faster growing cities saw less persistence in antisemitic attitudes, this may be due to the fact that trade-openness was associated with more economic success and therefore higher migration rates into these regions.

== From 1945 to the reunification ==
When the Red Army took over Berlin in late April 1945, only 8,000 Jews remained in the city, all of them either in hiding or married to non-Jews. Most German Jews who survived the war in exile decided to remain abroad; however, a small number returned to Germany. Additionally, approximately 15,000 German Jews survived the concentration camps or survived by going into hiding. These German Jews were joined by approximately 200,000 displaced persons (DPs), Eastern European Jewish Holocaust survivors. They came to Allied-occupied western Germany after finding no homes left for them in eastern Europe or after having been liberated on German soil. The overwhelming majority of the DPs wished to emigrate to Mandatory Palestine and lived in Allied- and UNRRA-administered displaced persons camps, remaining isolated from German society. When Israel became independent in 1948, most European-Jewish DPs left for the new state; however, 10,000 to 15,000 Jews decided to resettle in Germany. Despite hesitations and a long history of antagonism between German Jews (&quot;Yekkes&quot;) and East European Jews (&quot;Ostjuden&quot;), the two disparate groups united to form the basis of a new Jewish community. In 1950 they founded their unitary representative organization, the Central Council of Jews in Germany.

=== Jews of West Germany ===
The Jewish community in West Germany from the 1950s to the 1970s was characterized by its social conservatism and generally private nature. Although there were Jewish elementary schools in West Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munich, the community had a very high average age. Few young adults chose to remain in Germany, and many of those who did married non-Jews. Many critics of the community and its leadership accused it of ossification. In the 1980s, a college for Jewish studies was established in Heidelberg; however, a disproportionate number of its students were not Jewish. By 1990, the community numbered between 30,000 and 40,000. Although the Jewish community of Germany did not have the same impact as the pre-1933 community, some Jews were prominent in German public life, including Hamburg mayor Herbert Weichmann; Schleswig-Holstein Minister of Justice (and Deputy Chief Justice of the Federal Constitutional Court) Rudolf Katz; Hesse Attorney General Fritz Bauer; former Hesse Minister of Economics Heinz-Herbert Karry; West Berlin politician Jeanette Wolff; television personalities Hugo Egon Balder, Hans Rosenthal, Ilja Richter, Inge Meysel, and Michel Friedman; Jewish communal leaders Heinz Galinski, Ignatz Bubis, Paul Spiegel, and Charlotte Knobloch (see: Central Council of Jews in Germany), film score composer Hans Zimmer, and Germany&#x27;s most influential literary critic, Marcel Reich-Ranicki.

=== Jews of East Germany ===
The Jewish community of communist East Germany numbered only a few hundred active members. Most Jews who settled in East Germany did so either because their pre-1933 homes had been there or because they had been politically leftist before the Nazi seizure of power and, after 1945, wished to build an anti-fascist, socialist Germany. Most such politically engaged Jews were not religious or active in the official Jewish community. They included writers such as Anna Seghers, Stefan Heym, Stephan Hermlin, Jurek Becker, Stasi Colonel General Markus Wolf, singer Lin Jaldati, composer Hanns Eisler, and politician Gregor Gysi. However, from the 1950s to early 1980s, the State Security Service (the Stasi) persecuted the surviving small Jewish communities in East Germany. This was in keeping with the treatment of religious groups in general, who were often persecuted for their belief systems being considered contrary to socialist values and for having contact with the West. However, in the case of the Jewish population, this persecution was also related to Soviet hostility to Israel, which the Soviet state considered imperialist and capitalist. This hostility was also reflected in the media. Jewish community leaders criticized the media for &quot;provoking popular anti-semitism by the negative portrayal of Israel and Jews&quot;. According to the historian Mike Dennis, &#x27;Already decimated by the Holocaust, East German Jewry reeled from the shock of the SED&#x27;s (Socialist Unity Party of Germany) antisemitic campaigns.&#x27; Persecution methods ranged from the more brutal repression methods found in the Stalinist era of the 1940s and 50s, to the more subtle decomposition methods which were utilised extensively in the 70s and 80s. In the 1980s there was a reprieve, in general, of such persecution and the previous antisemitism was markedly changed with an attempt to &quot;reinvigorate Jewish culture&quot;. Economic and political pragmatism drove this change: the socialist leadership was keen to promote East Germany as an anti-fascist state; improve its legitimacy domestically and internationally; and due to their increasingly precarious economic situation, to build bridges with the US especially in a bid to secure more favourable trading terms and to stabilise the economy. Many East German Jews emigrated to Israel in the 1970s.

== In the reunited Germany (post-1990) ==


The end of the Cold War contributed to a growth of the Jewish community of Germany. An important step for the renaissance of Jewish life in Germany occurred in 1990 when Helmut Kohl convened with Heinz Galinski, to allow Jewish people from the former Soviet Union to emigrate to Germany, which led to a large Jewish emigration. Germany is home to a nominal Jewish population of more than 200,000 (although this number reflects non-Jewish spouses or children who also immigrated under the Quota Refugee Law); around 100,000 are officially registered with Jewish religious communities. The size of the Jewish community in Berlin is estimated at 120,000 people, or 60% of Germany&#x27;s total Jewish population. Today, between 80 and 90 percent of the Jews in Germany are Russian speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Many Israelis also move to Germany, particularly Berlin, for its relaxed atmosphere and low cost of living. Olim L&#x27;Berlin, a Facebook snowclone asking Israelis to emigrate to Berlin, gained notoriety in 2014. Some eventually return to Israel after a period of residence in Germany. There are also a handful of Jewish families from Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, Turkey, Morocco, and Afghanistan. Germany has the third-largest Jewish population in Western Europe after France (600,000) and Britain (300,000) and the fastest-growing Jewish population in Europe in recent years. The influx of immigrants, many of them seeking renewed contact with their Ashkenazi heritage, has led to a renaissance of Jewish life in Germany. In 1996, Chabad-Lubavitch of Berlin opened a center. In 2003, Chabad-Lubavitch of Berlin ordained 10 rabbis, the first rabbis to be ordained in Germany since World War II. In 2002 a Reform rabbinical seminary, Abraham Geiger College, was established in Potsdam. In 2006, the college announced that it would be ordaining three new rabbis, the first Reform rabbis to be ordained in Germany since 1942.

Partly owing to the deep similarities between Yiddish and German, Jewish studies have become a popular academic study, and many German universities have departments or institutes of Jewish studies, culture, or history. Active Jewish religious communities have sprung up across Germany, including in many cities where the previous communities were no longer extant or were moribund. Several cities in Germany have Jewish day schools, kosher facilities, and other Jewish institutions beyond synagogues. Additionally, many of the Russian Jews were alienated from their Jewish heritage and unfamiliar or uncomfortable with religion. American-style Reform Judaism (which originated in Germany), has re-emerged in Germany, led by the Union of Progressive Jews in Germany, even though the Central Council of Jews in Germany and most local Jewish communities officially adhere to Orthodoxy.
On 27 January 2003, then German chancellor Gerhard Schröder signed the first-ever agreement on a federal level with the Central Council, so that Judaism was granted the same elevated, semi-established legal status in Germany as the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church in Germany, at least since the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany of 1949.

In Germany it is a criminal act to deny the Holocaust or that six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust (§ 130 StGB); violations can be punished with up to five years of prison. In 2007, the Interior Minister of Germany, Wolfgang Schäuble, pointed out the official policy of Germany: &quot;We will not tolerate any form of extremism, xenophobia or antisemitism.&quot; Although the number of right-wing groups and organisations grew from 141 (2001) to 182 (2006), especially in the formerly communist East Germany, Germany&#x27;s measures against right-wing groups and antisemitism are effective: according to the annual reports of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution the overall number of far-right extremists in Germany has dropped in recent years from 49,700 (2001), 45,000 (2002), 41,500 (2003), 40,700 (2004), 39,000 (2005), to 38,600 in 2006. Germany provided several million euros to fund &quot;nationwide programs aimed at fighting far-right extremism, including teams of traveling consultants, and victims&#x27; groups&quot;. Despite these facts, Israeli Ambassador Shimon Stein warned in October 2006 that Jews in Germany feel increasingly unsafe, stating that they &quot;are not able to live a normal Jewish life&quot; and that heavy security surrounds most synagogues or Jewish community centers. Yosef Havlin, Rabbi at the Chabad Lubavitch in Frankfurt, does not agree with the Israeli Ambassador and states in an interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in September 2007 that the German public does not support far-right groups; instead, he has personally experienced the support of Germans, and as a Jew and rabbi he &quot;feels welcome in his (hometown) Frankfurt, he is not afraid, the city is not a no-go-area&quot;.

A flagship moment for the burgeoning Jewish community in modern Germany occurred on 9 November 2006 (the 68th anniversary of Kristallnacht), when the newly constructed Ohel Jakob synagogue was dedicated in Munich, Germany. This is particularly crucial given the fact that Munich was once at the ideological heart of Nazi Germany.
Jewish life in the capital Berlin is prospering, the Jewish community is growing, the Centrum Judaicum and several synagogues—including the largest in Germany—have been renovated and opened, and Berlin&#x27;s annual week of Jewish culture and the Jewish Cultural Festival in Berlin, held for the 21st time, featuring concerts, exhibitions, public readings and discussions can only partially explain why Rabbi Yitzhak Ehrenberg of the orthodox Jewish community in Berlin states: &quot;Orthodox Jewish life is alive in Berlin again. [...] Germany is the only European country with a growing Jewish community.&quot;

In spite of Germany&#x27;s measures against right-wing groups and antisemites, a number of incidents have occurred in recent years.
On 29 August 2012, in Berlin, Daniel Alter, a rabbi in visible Jewish garb, was physically attacked by a group of Arab youths, causing a head wound that required hospitalization. The rabbi was walking with his six-year-old daughter in downtown Berlin when the group asked if he was a Jew, and then proceeded to assault him. They also threatened to kill the rabbi&#x27;s young daughter.
On 9 November 2012, the 74th Kristallnacht anniversary, neo-Nazis in Greifswald vandalized the city&#x27;s Holocaust memorial. Additionally, a group of Jewish children was taunted by unidentified young people on the basis of their religion.

On 2 June 2013, a rabbi was physically assaulted by a group of six to eight &quot;southern-looking&quot; youths in a shopping mall in Offenbach. The rabbi took pictures of the attackers on his cellphone, but mall security and local police instructed him to delete the photos. The rabbi exited the mall, pursued by his attackers, and was driven away by an acquaintance. In Salzwedel, also in 2013, vandals painted swastikas and the words &quot;Hitler now&quot; on the exteriors of local houses.

Through the start of the 21st century, Germany has witnessed a sizable migration of young, educated Israeli Jews seeking academic and employment opportunities, with Berlin being their favorite destination.

<doc id="1263534" wikidata="Q312153" url="?curid=1263534" title="Aleksei Antonov">
<text>Aleksei Innokentievich Antonov (; 9 September 1896 – 16 June 1962) was a General of the Soviet Army, awarded the Order of Victory for his efforts in World War II. From 1945 to 1946 he was Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union.

==Career==
Born in Grodno in a family of Kryashen ethnicity as the son of an artillery officer of the Imperial Russian Army, Antonov graduated from Frunze Military Academy in 1921 and joined the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. He became an instructor at Frunze Military Academy in 1938.

In 1941, Antonov became chief of staff for the Soviet Southwestern Front and Southern Front. In December 1942, he became Deputy Chief General Staff of the combined Soviet forces and Head of the Operations Directorate, a pivotal role within the Stavka. In fact, A. I. Antonov was effective leader of the Soviet General Staff since chief of staff A. M. Vasilevsky was usually absent due to his frequent frontline missions as Stavka representative. As a result, Stavka relieved Antonov of his position in Operational Directorate, so that Antonov could fully concentrate in the leadership in the General Staff. In February 1945, Vasilevsky was appointed as the commander of 3rd Belarusian Front, and Antonov finally became the formal leader of Soviet General Staff. In spite of his key role in the Red Army&#x27;s ultimate victory, he was never named a Marshal of the Soviet Union.

Richard Overy writes of him at this time:
Vasilevsky came to rely on one subordinate above all others: the chief of operations, General Aleksei Antonov. [...] On December 11 [1942] the forty-six-year-old Antonov stepped into the role which was more directly exposed to Stalin&#x27;s inquisitive leadership than any other. Antonov rose to the challenge. Instead of rushing off to report to Stalin when he arrived in Moscow, he spent the first week familiarizing himself thoroughly with the General Staff and the state of the front. Only when he was fully primed did he go to see his commander. The two men developed the most effective working relationship of the war. Antonov displayed a calm intelligence married to a massive energy and exceptional industry. According to his deputy, General Sergei Shtemenko, Antonov never lost his temper or allowed circumstances to get the better of him. He was firm, caustic, slow to praise and a tough taskmaster, but the rigorous regimen that he imposed on his staff won their respect. Above all he was adept at manipulating Stalin. He did not sugar-coat his reports. He was prepared to stand up to Stalin with what his deputy regarded as a &#x27;brave outspokenness&#x27;. So skilled was he at providing the evening situation reports concisely and accurately that even Zhukov bowed to his capability and allowed Antonov to present them in his place. The trust that Stalin came to place in Antonov was reflected in his survivability. He retained his office until February 1945, when he was made chief of staff in Vasilevsky&#x27;s place.

By 1944, Antonov was Chief Spokesman and was present at the Moscow, Yalta and Potsdam Conferences. At the Yalta Conference, he briefed the Western Allies on co-ordinating military actions, and by stressing how the Allies could aid Soviets through bombing lines of communications contributed to the Dresden raid.

After the war, Antonov became Deputy Commander-in-Chief and then Commander-in-Chief of the Transcaucasus Military District. In 1955, he became Chief of Staff of the Combined Forces of the Warsaw Pact. He held this post until his death in 1962.

Antonov died on 16 June 1962 in Moscow, and his ashes interred in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

==Family==
In 1956, Antonov married ballerina Olga Lepeshinskaya. It was his second marriage.

<text>Édison Vicente Méndez Méndez (; born March 16, 1979, in Ibarra) is an Ecuadorian football coach and former player who played as either a winger or an attacking midfielder. He is the current manager of club deportivo La Union.

Méndez is a former Ecuador International and is the second-most capped player for his country.

==Playing style==
He is known for his pace, accurate passing and long range shooting. He is also known as a dead-ball specialist, and generally takes free kicks and corners for his country and club. While he is right-footed, he can play on either wing as well as in the middle.

==Club career==

===Deportivo Quito===
Méndez began his career with Sociedad Deportivo Quito of his native Ecuador. After his 2002 FIFA World Cup performances, during which he scored the winning goal in Ecuador&#x27;s 1-0 win over Croatia, he was rumored to have attracted interest from English clubs, notably Aston Villa and Everton.

===Short spells in Ecuador and Mexico===
He transferred to Club Irapuato of the Primera División de México for the latter part of the 2004 season, starting 16 games and scoring 5 goals during the remainder of that season. Following Irapuato&#x27;s relegation the following year, Méndez moved to Santos Laguna, where he struggled to find a place, in 14 games, and scoring 2 goals.

He returned to Ecuador, and was part of the LDU Quito team who won the Ecuadorian Apertura season in 2005.

===PSV Eindhoven===
In 2006, shortly after the World Cup, there was speculation of a move to Germany, more specifically Hannover. He ended all rumours in August 2006 by signing a one-season loan deal with PSV Eindhoven, which was followed by a contract for three and a half years which would tie him to the Philips Stadion outfit until 2010. He made his debut in the Eredivisie against Willem II, and marked his stamp in his new club by scoring two goals for a 3–1 win. The following week he became the first Ecuadorian to play in the UEFA Champions League and made his debut against Liverpool F.C. He was voted Man of the Match in the game.

In March 2007, he became the first Ecuadorian to score in the UEFA Champions League by getting the only goal in the round of 16 match against Arsenal. Mendez, along with fellow midfielders Timmy Simons and veteran Philip Cocu helped PSV reach the quarterfinals.

Mendez&#x27;s reputation was enhanced when he was among 50 players nominated for the Ballon d&#x27;Or-award for the best players in Europe. In Winter 2007, rumors stated that Mendez wanted a move back to Ecuador.

===Return to Ecuador===
On August 4, 2009, Mendez returned to Ecuador for personal reasons to play for his former team LDU Quito. However, there is speculation that he could return to the club for the 2012 season.

===Going to Brazil===
In March, Brazilian club Clube Atlético Mineiro announced Méndez as its new player. The Ecuadorian midfielder started defending his new team after the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

===Independiente Santa Fe===
On December 11, 2013, it was confirmed that Mendez would join Colombian side Santa Fe.

===Return to El Nacional===

On January 7, 2015, it was confirmed that would Méndez return to Ecuador to play for El Nacional.

==International career==

===Ecuador U20===
He participated at the South American U-20 Championship in Paraguay in 1999, and Olympic qualifying tournament in Brazil in January 2000. Two months later, he was called up to the full squad and made his debut in a 3–1 defeat against Honduras in Quito.

===Ecuador national team===
He played all three games of Ecuador&#x27;s 2002 World Cup campaign, scoring in the 1-0 victory in the final group stage match over Croatia, the country&#x27;s first ever victory in a FIFA World Cup. The win against Croatia came as a surprise, eliminating them and sealing Méndez&#x27;s reputation as a star. He was seen by many to be the promise or Ecuadorian football and gained interest from many clubs.

He scored five goals in the qualifying stage for the FIFA World Cup, including a dazzling double from long range against Paraguay in 2005, helping Ecuador to a 5–2 win in Quito. With his goals, he helped Ecuador qualify to the Germany 06 edition.

Méndez again played throughout his team&#x27;s historic campaign in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which culminated in a 1–0 defeat to England in the round of sixteen. He was credited with two assists throughout the whole tournament.

He played for Ecuador in the Copa América 2007. In that tournament he scored a consolation goal against Mexico as they were eliminated 2-1. On February 26, 2008, Mendez announced his retirement from the national team, to the surprise of most Ecuadorians and the Latin American world. He has stated that one of the reasons for his early retirement is dissatisfaction with the newly appointed Ecuador coach, Sixto Vizuete. However, on 12 May 2008, Méndez announced his return to the national team, after a meeting with Vizuete and the FEF president, Luis Chiriboga, in which they solved any differences and misunderstandings that could have led the player to his early retirement.

On June 30, 2014, after the 2014 FIFA World Cup held in Brazil, Méndez stated that &quot;His cycle is over&quot;, retiring from the Ecuador national team after a span of 14 years, ending with 111 Caps and 18 Goals for his country.

==Personal life==
His nephew is fellow professional footballer and Ecuadorean international player Sebas Méndez.

<text>Dexit was a publicly traded company in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It offered a rechargeable, contactless, stored-value smart key tag used for electronic payment in on-line or off-line systems locally in 2003, until it stopped operating in 2006. Dexit was rebranded in 2007 and its name changed to Hosted Data Transaction Solutions Inc (HDX) and is currently now known as Posera.

Instead of coins or cards (and PIN), Dexit used an RFID key tag device associated with funds transferred from ordinary bank accounts. There is no link to access the accounts from the key tag, a feature to guard against the abuse of lost key tags. Accounts can be filled up from the Dexit website, by telephone, at participating merchants, or through pre-approved bank account or credit card balance transfers.

A partnership between small retailers, Dexit Inc., TD Canada Trust, National Bank of Canada, Telus Mobility, Bell Canada in Toronto&#x27;s downtown, and a few retailers in and around Toronto. There were plans to expand to the rest of Toronto in 2005; however, this does not appear to have occurred.

In the summer of 2006, Dexit announced a restructuring, and nearly all payment terminals have been removed from stores. Dexit is also offering refunds of all funds that have been stored on Dexit Tags.

Dexit later became HDX Solutions Inc.

<doc id="1263558" wikidata="Q16950185" url="?curid=1263558" title="Bandora (instrument)">
<text>The bandora or bandore is a large long-necked plucked string-instrument that can be regarded as a bass cittern though it does not have the re-entrant tuning typical of the cittern. Probably first built by John Rose in England around 1560, it remained popular for over a century. A somewhat smaller version was the orpharion.

The bandora is frequently one of the two bass instruments in a broken consort as associated with the works of Thomas Morley, and it is also a solo instrument in its own right. Anthony Holborne wrote many pieces for solo bandora. The multiple lute settings of Pacoloni appear both with and without optional wire-strung instruments.

==Construction and type==
The bandora, though built like a cittern, had six or seven &quot;courses&quot; (unison pairs) of strings tuned in a more lute-like fashion, but without the high d found on a bass lute. In fact, the barring is very close to an orpharion, and closer to contemporary lute than to cittern or guitar construction. This creates a proportion closer to present guitar tunings; typically C D G C E A, and occasionally a seventh low G string.

Thomas Morley calls for a &quot;Pandora&quot; in his Consort Lessons.
The term bandore and bandora were occasionally incorrectly applied to a Ukrainian folk instrument now more commonly known as the bandura, an instrument with up to 68 strings that differs considerably from the bandora.

During the Renaissance there were no naming conventions and terms were used loosely.
The Spanish bandurria, though this term was once also interchangeable, now applies to a treble instrument like a mandolin - a similar confusion as has occurred with mandore, mandora, mandola (q.v.). All these instruments are thought to derive their names originally from the ancient Greek pandura (which term, once again, is found applied to a variety of stringed instruments in different regions at an early date).

<doc id="1263567" wikidata="Q581741" url="?curid=1263567" title="Chimor">
<text>Chimor (also Kingdom of Chimor or Chimú Empire) was the political grouping of the Chimú culture. The culture arose about 900 CE, succeeding the Moche culture, and was later conquered by the Inca emperor Topa Inca Yupanqui around 1470, fifty years before the arrival of the Spanish in the region. Chimor () was the largest kingdom in the Late Intermediate Period, encompassing 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) of coastline.

According to Chimú oral history, the history of Chimor began with the arrival of Taycanamo in the Moche Valley from the sea on a balsa raft. From there his descendants would conquer surrounding areas starting with his son Guacriur. Guacricur integrated Chimú reign over the lower valley and Ñancempinco, Taycanamo&#x27;s grandson would expand the kingdom by conquering the upper valley. Ñançenpinco began to further expansion both north and south of the Moche Valleys. 

The first valleys seem to have joined forces willingly, but the Sican culture was acquired through conquest. They also were significantly influenced by the pre-Inca Cajamarca and Wari cultures. According to legend, its capital of Chan Chan was founded by Taycanamo, who arrived in the area by sea. Chimor was the last kingdom that had any chance of stopping the Inca Empire. But the Inca conquest began in the 1470s by Topa Inca Yupanqui, defeating the emperor and descendant of Taycanamo, Minchançaman, and was nearly complete when Huayna Capac assumed the throne in 1493.

The Chimú resided on a strip of desert on the northern coast of Peru. The rivers in the region carved a series of fertile valley plains, which were very flat and well-suited to irrigation. Agriculture and fishing were both very important to the Chimú economy.

Worshipping the moon, the Chimú, unlike the Inca, considered it more powerful than the sun. Offerings played an important role in religious rites. A common object for offerings, as well as one used by artisans, was the shell of the &quot;Spondylus&quot; shellfish, which resides only in the warm coastal waters off present-day Ecuador. Associated with the sea, rainfall, and fertility, &quot;Spondylus&quot; shells were highly valued and traded by the Chimú people, and the exchange of the shells played a significant economic and political role in the empire.

The Chimú people are best known for their distinctive monochromatic pottery and fine metal working of copper, gold, silver, bronze, and &quot;tumbaga&quot; (copper and gold). The pottery is often in the shape of a creature or has a human figure sitting or standing on a cuboid bottle. The shiny black finish of most Chimú pottery was achieved by firing the pottery at high temperatures in a closed kiln, which prevented oxygen from reacting with the clay.

== History ==
===Early Chimú (Moche civilization)===

The oldest civilization present on the north coast of Peru is the Moche or Mochica civilization, which is identified as Early Chimú. The start of this period is not known for certain, but it ended around 700 CE. It was centered in the Chicama, Moche, and Viru Valleys. &quot;Many large pyramids are attributed to the Early Chimú period.&quot; (37) These pyramids are built of adobe in rectangular shapes made from molds. &quot;Early Chimú cemeteries are also found without pyramid associations. Burials are usually in extended positions, in prepared tombs. The rectangular, adobe-lined and covered tombs have niches in their walls in which bowls were placed.&quot; (39)

The Early pottery is also characterized by realistic modeling and painted scenes.

===Expansion and rule===
====Expansion====
During the reign of the Wari Empire over Peru, the mature Chimú culture developed in roughly the same territory where the Mochica had existed centuries before. The Chimú was also a coastal culture - according to legend, its capital of Chan Chan was founded by Taycanamo, who arrived in the area by sea. It was developed in the Moche Valley north of present-day Lima, northeast of Huarmey, and finishing in central present-day Trujillo. Later, it expanded to Arequipa. During this time Arequipa was framed by 3 volcanoes. (39)

The Chimú appeared in the year 900: Chimor, also known as the Kingdom of Chimor, had its capital &quot;at the great site now called Chanchan, between Trujillo and the sea, and we may assume that Taycanamo founded his kingdom there. His son, Guacri-caur, conquered the lower part of the valley and was succeeded by a son named Nancen-pinco who really laid the foundations of the Kingdom by conquering the head of the valley of Chimor and the neighboring valleys of Sana, Pacasmayo, Chicama, Viru, Chao and Santa.&quot;

The estimated founding date of the last Chimú kingdom is in the first half of the fourteenth century. Nacen-pinco was believed to have ruled around 1370 and was followed by seven rulers whose names are not yet known. Minchançaman followed these rulers, and was ruling around the time of the Inca conquest (between 1462 and 1470). This great expansion is believed to have occurred during the late period of Chimú civilization, called: Late Chimú, but the development of the Chimú territory spanned a number of phases and more than a single generation. Nacen-pinco, &quot;may have pushed the imperial frontiers to Jequetepeque and to Santa, but conquest of the entire region was an agglutinative process initiated by earlier rulers.&quot; (17)

The Chimú expanded to include a vast area and many different ethnic groups. The first valleys seem to have joined forces willingly, but the Sican culture was assimilated through conquest. At its peak, the Chimú advanced to the limits of the desert coast to the valley of the Jequetepeque River in the north. Pampa Grande in the Lambayeque Valley was also ruled by the Chimú.

To the south, they expanded as far as Carabayllo. Their expansion southward was stopped by the military power of the great valley of Lima. Historians and archeologists contest how far south they managed to expand.

Life in the Chimú Empire

From what scholars can tell the Chimú had a complex and consolidated empire. The capitol consisted of Chan Chan, lower-class, workshops and homes with a population estimate of around 30,000. These workshop were all built in around adobe palaces in order to impose social hierarchy ideals. The Chan Chan also had restrictions and were not offered the same privileges as the elite. They had limited access to rituals, bureaucracy, and administrative roles. The high regulations were necessary to keep order with food production and state re-distribution of the products. The class system also helped to determine who would work to create state-sponsored monuments.

====Rule====

The Chimú society was a four-level hierarchical system, with a powerful elite rule over administrative centers. The hierarchy was centered at the walled cities, called &quot;ciudadelas&quot;, at Chan Chan. The political power at Chan Chan is demonstrated by the organization of labor to construct the Chimú&#x27;s canals and irrigated fields.

Chan Chan was the top of the Chimu hierarchy, with Farfán in the Jequetepeque Valley as a subordinate. This organization, which was quickly established during the conquest of the Jequetepeque Valley, suggests the Chimú established the hierarchy during the early stages of their expansion. The existing elite at peripheral locations, such as the Jequetepeque Valley and other centers of power, were incorporated into the Chimú government on lower levels of the hierarchy. These lower-order centers managed land, water, and labor, while the higher-order centers either moved the resources to Chan Chan or carried out other administrative decisions. Rural sites were used as engineering headquarters, while the canals were being built; later they operated as maintenance sites. The numerous broken bowls found at &quot;Quebrada del Oso&quot; support this theory, as the bowls were probably used to feed the large workforce that built and maintained that section of canal. The workers were probably fed and housed at state expense.

Cultural and Economic Exchange

The Chimú&#x27;s vast territorial expansion increased the amount of cultural identities within the civilization. They also incorporated political ideologies along with cultural beliefs this is seen with the Late Sicán in the north and the Casma in the South. Despite this, many areas kept distinctive aspects of their culture and some gained autonomy after the conquest.

It has been argued that Chimú leaders conquered territories further away because of the deviations in inheritance. The opposition to this is that an El Niño that had caused the state to increase the extractive economy in place and get supplies from other areas of the Andes. This El Niño is theorized to have occurred around A.D. 1100 and would have caused the destruction of irrigation canals. Both arguments suggest that agriculture expansion led to increased identities socially and politically.

The Chimú conquered the Jequetepeque around 1320 and changed the political structure of the society. Places like Pacatnamú were left behind and other sites like Farfán had increased laborers for administrative compounds constructed under the supervision of Imperial administrators. Land use, agricultural methods and settlement patterns of the Jequetepeque societies all changed after the conquest. Many households had to see tribute requirements and agricultural production increased.

==== Downfall ====

The state governed such social classes until the empire of the Sican culture conquered the kingdom of Lambayeque, Peru. The legends of war were said to have been told by the leaders Naylamp in the Sican language and Taycanamo in Chimú. The people paid tribute to the rulers with products or labor.

Chimor was the last Andean kingdom capable of stopping the Inca Empire, but the Inca conquest began in the 1470s by Topa Inca Yupanqui, defeating the emperor Minchançaman, and was nearly complete when Huayna Capac assumed the throne in 1493. They moved Minchançaman, the final Chimú emperor, to Cusco and redirected gold and silver there to adorn the Qurikancha.

== Economy ==
Chan Chan could be said to have developed a bureaucracy due to the elite&#x27;s controlled access to information. The economic and social system operated through the import of raw materials, where they were processed into prestige goods by artisans at Chan Chan. The elite at Chan Chan made the decisions on most other matters concerning organization, monopolizing production, storage of food and products, and distribution or consumption of goods.
The majority of the citizens in each &quot;ciudadela&quot; were artisans. In the late Chimú, about 12,000 artisans lived and worked in Chan Chan alone. They engaged in fishing, agriculture, craft work, and trade. Artisans were forbidden to change their profession, and were grouped in the &quot;ciudadela&quot; according to their area of specialization. Archeologists have noted a dramatic increase in Chimú craft production, and they believe that artisans may have been brought to Chan Chan from another area taken as a result of Chimú conquest. As there is evidence of both metalwork and weaving in the same domestic unit, it is likely that both men and women were artisans. They engaged in fishing, agriculture, and metallurgy, and made ceramics and textiles from cotton and the wool of llama, alpaca, and vicuña. People used reed fishing canoes (displayed in the image on the right), hunted, and traded using bronze coins.

=== Subsistence and agriculture ===

The Chimú developed mainly through intensive farming techniques and hydraulic work, which joined valleys to form complexes, such as the Chicama-Moche complex, which was a combination of two valleys in La Libertad. The Lambayeque linked the valleys of La Leche, Lambayeque, Reque, and Saña Jequetepeque. They developed an excellent agricultural techniques which expanded the strength of their cultivated areas. &quot;Huachaques&quot; were sunken farms where land was withdrawn to work the moist, sandy soil underneath, an example of which is Tschudi.
The Chimú used walk-in wells, similar to those of the Nazca, to draw water, and reservoirs to contain the water from rivers. This system increased the productivity of the land, which increased Chimú wealth, and likely contributed to the formation of a bureaucratic system. The Chimú cultivated beans, sweet potato, papaya, and cotton with their reservoir and irrigation system. This focus on large-scale irrigation persisted until the Late Intermediate period. At this point, there was a shift to a more specialized system that focused on importing and redistributing resources from satellite communities. There appears to have been a complex network of sites that provided goods and services for Chimú subsistence. Many of these sites produced commodities that the Chimú could not.

Many sites relied on marine resources, but after the advent of agriculture, there were more sites further inland, where marine resources were harder to attain. Keeping llamas arose as a supplemental way of attaining meat, but by the Late Intermediate period and Late Horizon, inland sites used llamas as a main resource, although they maintained contact with coastal sites to use supplemental marine resources. They also made masks.

====Technology====

One of the earliest known examples of distance communication is a Chimú device consisting of two resin-coated gourds connected by a 75-foot length of twine. Only one example has been found, and nothing is known about its originator or use.

== Split inheritance ==

The Chimu capital, Chan Chan, had a series of elite residential compounds or cuidadelas that were not occupied simultaneously, but sequentially. The reason for this is that Chimu rulers practiced split inheritance, which dictated that the heir to the throne had to build his own palace. After the death of a ruler, all the ruler&#x27;s wealth would be distributed to more distant relatives.

== Visual arts ==

=== Shell ===
The Chimú people highly valued mollusk shell for its economic and political significance as a luxury good traded over long distances, and the shell was often viewed as a symbol of elite status and divine power. Using shell as a medium for their art and artifacts, the Chimú frequently employed the shell of &quot;Spondylus&quot;, a type of marine bivalve mollusk.

The most abundant &quot;Spondylus&quot; species present in Peru are &quot;Spondylus calcifer&quot; Carpenter and &quot;Spondylus princeps&quot; Broderip. &quot;Spondylus calcifer&quot; has red and white hues, primarily used for beads and artifacts. While this species resides in shallower waters and is easier to obtain, the &quot;Spondylus princeps&quot;, known as the “thorny oyster” for its characteristic spines, is a solid red color and can only be harvested by experienced divers. Thus, this shell is more highly desired and traded by the Chimú people.

==== Uses and symbolism ====

&quot;Spondylus&quot; shell had a wide variety of uses in Andean culture and took a variety of forms, ranging from whole shells to fragments to ground shell powder. This material was worked to create intricately carved ornaments, tools, and goods reserved for the nobles and deities. Shell fragments have been found as inlays for body ornaments and as beads for pieces of jewelry. The image to the right displays a Chimú collar made of cotton, red &quot;Spondylus&quot; shell beads, and black stone beads, and the image below displays a sling shot made of shell. Representing wealth and power, the shell was ground into powder and spread out before the Chimor king by an official called the Fonga Sigde, forming a “red carpet” for the ruler as he walked. Shell were likewise used for ornamentation of certain buildings and architectural structures.

Found in the tombs of nobles, these artifacts were often used as burial goods and played a role in sacrificial practices. Due to its aquatic origins, shells were prized for their connection to the sea and role in water and fertility rituals, used as offerings in agricultural fields to promote abundant crop yields. The Chimú also placed shells in sources of water, such as wells and springs, to bring rain to their fields, especially in times of drought.

The symbolic significance of the &quot;Spondylus&quot; shell is closely related to the physical attributes and biological properties of the bivalve. Its characteristic morphology contributed to the association of the shell with divine power and the supernatural world. The external spines of &quot;Spondylus&quot; lend to the shell its ties to strength and protection. Because of its shape and red blood-like color, the shell often represents death, sacrifice, and ritual bloodletting practices, as well as female reproductive body parts. Known as the &quot;daughter of the sea,&quot; the &quot;Spondylus&quot; shell has also been linked to femininity, with the univalve embodying masculinity.

&quot;Spondylus&quot; has specialized sensory organs, in particular sensitive eyes and papillae, that Andean cultures associate with extra sensory protection. Sensitive to temperature changes in water and thriving in warmer waters, the shell was thought to have divinatory powers, and because its migratory patterns are related to El Niño conditions, its presence is seen as an omen for disaster.

Moreover, &quot;Spondylus&quot; exhibits seasonal toxicity, known as Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Twice a year, the mollusk tissue contains substances that are toxic to humans, caused by poisonous algae that the mollusks consume. During these months, the shells are offered to weather and fertility deities as “food for the gods”, as it was thought that only deities were powerful enough to eat the flesh of the bivalve. At tolerable levels, human consumption of this toxic flesh may result in muscle weakness, mind-altering states, and euphoria, but in more concentrated doses, may lead to paralysis and death. Because of these hallucinogenic effects, &quot;Spondylus&quot; was a symbol of spiritual transcendence and was viewed as bridge between physical and supernatural worlds.

==== Diving ====

Though the remains of shell workshops and artifacts are abundant in Chimor, the &quot;Spondylus&quot; shell originates in the warm waters of Ecuador. Harvesting the shell is both a time and labor-intensive process, requiring experienced divers to free dive to depths of up to 50 meters and pry the shells off of rocks.

The difficult task of shell diving is captured in the imagery of many portable Andean artifacts, such as bowls, earspools, and textiles. Many of these images are similar, illustrating a boat with sailors holding cords attached to the divers in the water. Stone weights are suspended from the divers as they gather shells, and portrayals of &quot;Spondylus&quot; often emphasize their characteristic spines. The image to the right features a Chimú earspool, which was molded from gold-copper and silver alloys and depicts a shell diving scene. The rectangle in the upper half of the earspool is a boat with large sails, and birds reside at the top of the piece. Four divers swim beneath the boat and are near spiky eggshell-shaped shells.

Sections of &quot;ciudadelas&quot;, large compounds often reserved for the kings and elite individuals, were used as storage areas for shell artifacts, and the architecture and ornamentation of these structures symbolize the treasures of the sea. Los &quot;Buceadores&quot; (the Divers), a relief in Chan Chan in Ciudadela Uhle, displays imagery of a pair of figures in a tule boat, one of whom holds a paddle, and another pair of shell divers beneath the boat and connected to ropes. The relief also features a net-like semicircle, as well as spiny figures that represent shells.

==== Production and trade ====
Much of the existing evidence for shell-working in the Andes stems from archaeological findings and colonial texts. &quot;Spondylus&quot; is abundant in sites across Peru, discovered in burial sites and with the remains of shell workshops. The high level of uniformity in these shell objects, combined with the technical nature of shell-working, indicate that &quot;Spondylus&quot; production was domestic and carried out by independent craftsmen. Many collections of &quot;Spondylus&quot; artifacts contain objects from various stages of shell production: whole shells, fragments, worked pieces, and debris from shell reduction. Though researchers have uncovered worked shell debris and ample proof for the presence of shell workshops, they have only identified and discussed very few specific shell workshops. One workshop, which was thought to be maintained by the Chimú people, was identified at Túcume in the Lambayeque Region of Peru by archaeologist and researcher Daniel Sandweiss. Dating back to around 1390-1480 A.D., the workshop comprised various small rooms and contained evidence for the production of &quot;Spondylus&quot; beads. Shell debris from all stages of production, ranging from cut pieces to finished beads, along with the stone tools used to work the shell, were excavated from the site.

While many archaeological sources point to the abundance of shell-working, as the remains of shell workshops and artifacts were uncovered widely in Peru, little evidence documents the movement of &quot;Spondylus&quot; from its source in Ecuador to workshops in Chan Chan. The archaeological record indicates that Chimor was an important center for the exchange of trade, and shell often traveled long distances from its geographic source to reach the empire of Chimor. The trade of &quot;Spondylus&quot; was integral to the expanding political power and economy of the Chimú. The shell was viewed as an exotic material, and the Chimor control of the exchange of the imported luxury good served as a means of political control, establishing and legitimizing the rule of the nobles. Unlike the Inca Empire, the Chimú did not attempt to expand its command of the &quot;Spondylus&quot; trade through imperial conquests of neighboring states, but rather, used its existing access to the trade as a religious and financial justification for power.

Little information exists about the means by which &quot;Spondylus&quot; was acquired and exchanged along trade routes, and many scholars have proposed various models for &quot;Spondylus&quot; movement. The marine bivalve was likely traded either through independent merchants or state-administered long-distance trade, with a north-south movement of the items. One of the first accounts of exchange of &quot;Spondylus&quot; is a report written by Spanish colonist Francisco Xerez, who was a member of the expedition led by Francisco Pizarro, and describes a raft of luxury goods, such as textiles, emeralds, and gold and silver objects, which were to be traded for &quot;Spondylus&quot; shells.

Researchers likewise disagree on the transportation methods of shells and whether they were exported via sea or land. Imagery in Andean pottery and reliefs depict llama caravans carrying shell, providing evidence that the transportation of shell was at least in part overland.

=== Textiles ===
Spinning is the practice of combining a small set of threads to achieve a long and continuous thread with the use of an instrument called a spindle. The &quot;zone&quot; is an instrument made of a small wand that usually gets thinner at both ends; that was used alongside a &quot;tortera&quot; or &quot;piruro&quot;. The spindle is inserted into the bottom to make a counterweight. It starts spinning, taking the &quot;rueca&quot; (where the fiber was set to be spun). Fibers that are laid down in the zone are quickly turned between the thumb and index fingers and twisted to interlock the fibers, creating a long thread. After the desired lengths of threads are attained, the threads are intersected and woven in various combinations to make fabrics.

The Chimú embellished their fabrics with brocades, embroidery, fabrics doubles, and painted fabrics. Sometimes textiles were adorned with feathers and gold or silver plates. Tropical feathers used in such textiles are evidence of long-distance trade. Colored dyes were created from plants containing tannin, &quot;mole&quot;, or walnut; and minerals, such as clay, ferruginosa, or mordant aluminum; as well as from animals, such as cochineal. The garments were made of the wool of four animals: the guanaco, llama, alpaca, and vicuna. The people also used varieties of cotton, that grows naturally in seven different colors. The clothing consisted of the Chimú loincloth, sleeveless shirts with or without fringes, small ponchos, and tunics.

The majority of Chimú textiles were made from alpaca wool and cotton. Judging from the uniform spin direction, degree of the twist, and colors of the threads, it is likely that all of the fibers were pre-spun and imported from a single location.

=== Ceramics ===
The civilization is known for its exquisite and intricate metalworking, one of the most advanced of the pre-Columbian era. Chimú ceramics were crafted for two functions: containers for daily domestic use and those made for ceremonial use for offerings at burials. Domestic pottery was developed without higher finishing, while funeral ceramics show more aesthetic refinement.
The main features of Chimú ceramics were small sculptures, and manufacturing molded and shaped pottery for ceremonial or daily use. Ceramics were usually stained black, although there are some variations. Lighter ceramics were also produced in smaller quantities. The characteristic brightness was obtained by rubbing with a rock that previously had been polished. Many animals, fruits, characters, and mystical entities have been represented pictorially on Chimú ceramics. Archaeological evidence suggest that Chimor grew out of the remnants of the Moche, as early Chimú pottery had some resemblance to that of the Moche. Their ceramics are all black, and their work in precious metals is very detailed and intricate.

=== Metallurgy ===

Metalworking picked up quickly in the Late Chimú periods. The Chimú worked with metals such as gold, silver, and copper. Some Chimú artisans worked in metal workshops divided into sections for each specialized treatment of metals: plating, gold, stamping, lost-wax, pearl, the watermark, and embossing wooden molds. These techniques produced large variety of objects, such as cups, knives, containers, figurines, bracelets, pins, and crowns. They used arsenic to harden the metals after they were cast. Large-scale smelting took place in a cluster of workshops at Cerro de los Cemetarios. The process starts with ore extracted from mines or a river, which is heated to very high temperatures and then cooled. The result is a group of prills, such as small round sections of copper, in a mass of slag, which are other materials which are not useful for metallurgy. The prills are then extracted by crushing the slag, and then melted together to form ingots, which were fashioned into various items. The Chimú also shaped metals through hammering, as displayed in the image on the right of the silver Chimú beaker. Chimú metalsmiths achieved this technique with simple tools and a single sheet of gold. The artist would first carve a wooden mold. Then they would carefully hammer the paper-thin sheet of gold around the wooden base.

Although copper is found naturally on the coast, it was mostly attained from the highlands in an area about 3 days away. Since most of the copper was imported, it is likely that most of the metal objects that were made were likely very small. The pieces, such as wires, needles, digging stick points, tweezers, and personal ornaments, are consistently small, utilitarian objects of copper or copper bronze. The Tumi is one well-known Chimú work. They also made beautiful ritual costumes of gold compounds with plume headdresses, earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and breastplates.

== Religion ==

===Deities===

In Pacasmayo, the Moon deity (Si or Shi) was the greatest divinity. It was believed to be more powerful than the Sun, as it appeared by night and day, and it also controlled the weather and growth of crops. Devotees sacrificed animals and birds to the Moon, as well as their own children on piles of colored cottons with offerings of fruit and chicha. They believed the sacrificed children would become deified and they were usually sacrificed around age five.
The Chimú worshipped Mars (Nor) and Earth (Ghisa) deities, as well as the Sun (Jiang) and the Sea (Ni) deities. Jiang was associated with stones called alaec-pong (cacique stone), which were believed to be ancestors of the people in whose area they stood and sons of the Sun. The Chimú made offerings of maize flour of red ochre to Ni for protection against drowning and bountiful catches of fish.

Several constellations were also viewed as important. Two of the stars of Orion&#x27;s Belt were considered to be the emissaries of the Moon. The constellation Fur (the Pleiades) was used to calculate the year and was believed to watch over the crops.

Each district had local shrines that varied in importance. These shrines, called &quot;huacas,&quot; were also found in other parts of Peru, and had a sacred object of worship (&quot;macyaec&quot;) with an associated legend and cult.

===Sacrifice===
In 1997, members of an archaeological team discovered approximately 200 skeletal remains on the beach at Punta Lobos, Peru. These figures were blindfolded and had their hands bound behind their backs, their feet bound together, and their throats slashed. Archaeologists suggest these figures, likely bodies of fishermen, may have been killed as a sign of gratitude to the sea god Ni after they conquered the fishermen&#x27;s fertile seaside valley in 1350 A.D.

Tombs in the Huaca of the Moon belonged to six or seven teenagers from 13–14 years of age. Nine tombs belonged to children.

In 2011, archaeologists uncovered human and animal skeletons in the village of Huanchaco. After years of excavation, they identified more than 140 human (and more than 200 llama) skeletons from children between the ages of 6 and 15, all of whom had deep slashes across the sternum and broken rib cages indicating that their hearts may have been removed. According to &quot;National Geographic&quot;, if the analysis is correct, the discovery constitutes &quot;the largest single mass child sacrifice event known in world history&quot;. The burial is dated at 1400-1450 A.D. Anthropologist Haagen Klaus speculates that Chimú might have turned to children when the sacrifice of adults was not enough to stop torrential rain and flooding caused by El Niño. In August 2019 the archaeological team working at this site revealed that the bodies of 227 victims, aged between four and 14, had been excavated, further establishing this as the largest-ever known example of child sacrifice.

== Architecture ==
Differential architecture of palaces and monumental sites distinguished the rulers from the common people. At Chan Chan, there are ten large, walled enclosures called &quot;ciudadelas&quot;, or royal compounds, thought to be associated with the kings of Chimor. They are surrounded by adobe walls that are nine meters high, giving the &quot;ciudadela&quot; the appearance of a fortress.

The bulk of the Chimú population (approximately 26,000 people) lived in &quot;barrios&quot; on the outer edge of the city. They consisted of many single-family domestic spaces with a kitchen, work space, domestic animals, and storage area.

&quot;Ciudadelas&quot; frequently have U-shaped rooms that consist of three walls, a raised floor, and frequently, a courtyard, and there were often as many as 15 in one palace. In the early Chimú period, the U-shaped areas were found in strategic places for controlling the flow of supplies from storerooms, but it is unlikely that they served as storage areas. They are described as mnemonic devices for keeping track of the distribution of supplies. Over time, the frequency of the U-shaped structures increased, and the distribution of the structures changed, becoming more grouped, rather than dispersed, and occurring further away from access routes to resources.

The architecture of the rural sites also supported the idea of a hierarchical social order. They have similar structural components, making them mini-&quot;ciudadelas&quot; with rural adapted administrative functions. Most of these sites have smaller walls, with many &quot;audiencias&quot; as the focal point of the structures. These would be used to restrict access to certain areas and are often found at strategic points.

Chan Chan shows a lack of a unifying plan or a discernible pattern. The urban core contains six principal classes of architecture:
#Ten &quot;ciudadelas&quot; - citadels or palatial fortresses
#Domestic architecture associated with Chan Chan&#x27;s non-royal gentry 
#Artisan-class dwellings and workshops spread throughout the city
#Four &quot;huaca&quot;s or temple mounds
#U-shaped &quot;audiencias&quot; or courts
#SIAR or small irregular agglutinated rooms, which probably served as the residences for the majority of the population

<text>The Economic Research Service (ERS) is a component of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and a principal agency of the Federal Statistical System of the United States. It provides information and research on agriculture and economics.

==History==
The first USDA agency formally tasked with data collection was the Division of Statistics, created in 1863, one year after the USDA itself was created. By 1902, a Division of Foreign Markets had been created, and the following year, that division was merged with the Division of Statistics to form the Bureau of Statistics. In 1914, the bureau was renamed the Bureau of Crop Estimates, and in 1921 this bureau merged with the Bureau of Markets to form the Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates. This merger brought together &quot;responsibility for the collection of farm-level crop and livestock data with that for major domestic and foreign commodity market transactions&quot; in a single agency.

While the USDA&#x27;s data collection activities were developing, the department was also developing expertise in agricultural economics research. In 1903, the Office of Farm Management was formed within the Bureau of Plant Industry. In 1915, this office was transferred to the Office of the Secretary to provide analytic support during World War I. In 1919, the office was renamed in Office of Farm Management and Farm Economics. In 1920, the office became a separate USDA agency.

In 1922, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE), the ERS&#x27;s immediate predecessor, was established by the merger of the Office of Farm Management and Farm Economics and the Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates, bringing together responsibility for data collection and economic research/analysis in a single agency. This new agency brought together for the first time in data collection and economic analysis and research. The first leader of the BAE was the pioneering agricultural economist Henry Charles Taylor, appointed by Secretary of Agriculture Henry C. Wallace. In its initial years the BAE recruited agricultural economists from the handful of land-grant universities that offered the Ph.D in agriculture, such as Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Cornell. In 1937, the USDA Cotton Annex in the Southwest neighborhood of Washington, D.C. was built to contain offices and research facilities of the BAE.

The ERS was established by Secretary of Agriculture Memorandum 1446, supp. 1, of April 3, 1961. It was subsequently consolidated with other USDA units (including the Economic Development Service, established in 1969, and the Economic Management Support Center, established 1974) into the Economics, Statistics, and Cooperatives Service by Secretary&#x27;s Memorandum 1927, effective December 23, 1977. The agency was redesignated as the &quot;Economic Research Service&quot; by secretarial order of October 1, 1981.

Under the Trump administration, the ERS and another USDA agency, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture were directed to move from the USDA&#x27;s headquarters in Washington, D.C. to the Kansas City metropolitan area. Two-thirds of the USDA employees reassigned chose to quit rather than accept relocation. In 2018, the office of Trump&#x27;s Agriculture Secretary, Sonny Perdue, also issued a directive to ERS and other research components of USDA, ordering them to include a disclaimer on peer-reviewed research in scientific journals stating that findings and conclusions were &quot;preliminary&quot; and &quot;should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy.&quot; Susan Offutt, the ERS administrator under the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, said that the requirement was contrary to the USDA&#x27;s longstanding policy that permitted and encouraged federal scientists to publish work in journals, and the &quot;disclaimer&quot; mandate was strongly criticized by USDA employees, science advocates, and scientific journal editors. In May 2019, following an outcry, the USDA rescinded the directive.

Current and former employees of the ERS were strongly critical of the relocation to Kansas City and other Trump administration policies, and the exodus of scientific and economic talent and disruption to federal research (especially on climate change and food security) that they had caused. The move to Kansas City area resulted in an attrition rate particularly high in the Resource and Rural Economics Division (90%) and in the Food Economics Division (up to 89%). ERS economists said that the Trump administration&#x27;s moves were retaliation against the agency for publishing research reports detailing the negative economic effects of Trump&#x27;s policies, including the first tariffs and Republican tax legislation, on U.S. agriculture.

During the Biden administration, ERS headquarters moved back to Washington, DC, while the Kansas City office was retained.

==Functions==
Today, ERS&#x27;s mission is to provide &quot;economic research and information to inform public and private decision making on economic and policy issues related to agriculture, food, natural resources, and rural America.&quot;

The ERS and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) jointly fund and manage the Agricultural Resource Management Survey, a multi-phase, nationally representative survey of U.S. farms that is the USDA&#x27;s &quot;primary source of information on the financial condition, production practices, and resource use of America&#x27;s farm businesses and the economic well-being of America&#x27;s farm households.&quot;

The ERS publishes the magazine &quot;Amber Waves&quot; five times a year. The publication began in February 2003; it replaced &quot;Agricultural Outlook&quot;, &quot;FoodReview&quot;, and &quot;Rural America&quot;. The publication &quot;features information and economic analysis about food, farms, natural resources, and rural community issues&quot; and includes data and charts on various economic indications, including livestock cash receipts, farm household income, agricultural imports and exports, and food spending.

==Leadership, organization, and staff==
The ERS is led by an administrator, historically a career Senior Executive Service appointee that (along with NASS) reported to the Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics. However, in 2019, the Trump administration, under Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, moved to place ERS under the direct oversight of a political appointee, reporting to the chief economist under the Office of the Secretary. This restructuring prompted criticism that the ERS&#x27;s historically independent and autonomous data-collection mission would be compromised by political interference.

The ERS is organized into the Office of the Administrator and four divisions: The Food Economics Division; the Information Services Division; the Market and Trade Economics Division; and the Resource and Rural Economics Division. Each division is led by a director.

ERS had about 510 employees in 1998, 430 employees in 2009, and 250 employees in 2019. In 2019, in the wake of a relocation order, ERS employees voted overwhelmingly to unionize under the American Federation of Government Employees, forming their own bargaining unit.

<text>The Seychelles national football team, nicknamed &quot;the Pirates&quot;, represents Seychelles in international football and is controlled by the Seychelles Football Federation (SFF). SFF has been a member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and FIFA since 1986. The team&#x27;s home stadium is the 10,000-capacity Stade Linité located in Roche Caiman in the outskirts of Victoria, the capital of Seychelles.

== History ==

Football was introduced to Seychelles in the 1930s. Its first official competition, the Challenge Cup, was organized in 1936. Then in 1941, a championship between five teams was set up with matches of 60 minutes, played barefoot.

In 1969, the president of the Seychelles Football Federation wanted to set up a national team. Engaged on a voluntary basis, Adrian Fisher arrived on the island in September to reorganize Seychelles football. He equipped all the players with shoes, introduced contemporary training techniques and extended the match time to 90 minutes. The newly-formed national team played their first matches at a friendly tournament in Kenya in April 1970. In Seychelles&#x27; first matches played on a real football pitch, they drew 2–2 against Feisal F.C. then lost 1–2 to Mwengi at Mombasa Municipal Stadium. When Fisher left Seychelles in 1973, the team had played six games against four clubs.

Seychelles played their first match against another national team on March 13, 1974, against Réunion. In this friendly match, the &quot;Pirates&quot; lost 0–2. Two years later, this time as an independent nation, the Seychelles faced Réunion again, losing 1–4. In September 1977, they played their first match against a FIFA-affiliated team, Mauritius, during a tournament played in Réunion, and lost 1–2. The team enjoyed its first victory the following year by beating Réunion 1–0 at home.
In 1979, Seychelles played their first tournament, the 1979 Indian Ocean Games. They lost their first game 3–0 to Réunion, and beat Maldives 9–0 in their second. In the semi-final, they knocked out Mauritius 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw, but in the final they lost 2–1 to Réunion.

Seychelles were eliminated from the group stage at the 1985 Indian Ocean Games but, on August 31, 1986, they played their first competitive match recognised by FIFA and CAF, following their affiliation with both organisations, a qualification match against Mauritius for the 1987 All-Africa Games, which they lost 1–2. They participated, for the first time, in the 1988 African Cup of Nations qualifiers against Mauritius but lost 1–3 over the two legs.

At the 1990 Indian Ocean Games, the team suffered the heaviest defeat in its history against Madagascar in the semi-final, losing 0–6. In the bronze medal match, they won against Comoros 3–1. Despite hosting the following games, the team failed to repeat this performance, losing all four games and finishing last in the competition.

After the elimination from the preliminary phase of the 1996 African Cup of Nations by Mauritius 2–1 over the two legs, Vojo Gardašević was hired to lead the team. Following that, the &quot;Pirates&quot; again finished third in the 1998 Indian Ocean Games and, two years later, competed in the World Cup qualifiers for the first time. Playing against Namibia they drew 1–1 in Stade Linité, thanks to a goal by Philip Zialor but lost the second leg 0–3. Seychelles were also eliminated in the preliminary round of the 2000 African Cup of Nations by Zimbabwe 0–6 over the two matches. Seychelles fared better in the qualification for the 2004 African Cup of Nations as the team, led by Dominique Bathenay then Michael Nees, finished third and recorded two prestigious home wins: beating Eritrea 1–0 with a goal by veteran Roddy Victor, and beating a Peter Ndlovu-led Zimbabwe team 2–1 with goals by strikers Alpha Baldé and Philip Zialor. Following that they achieved a bronze medal at the 2003 Indian Ocean Games, then were eliminated in the preliminary round of the 2006 World Cup by Zambia, 1–5 in the two games.

In 2011, Seychelles hosted the 2011 Indian Ocean Island Games and won the tournament for the first time, beating Mauritius in the final on penalties.

The rest of the 2010s saw little success for &quot;The Pirates&quot; with the high point achieved during 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification where they managed a 2–0 win over Lesotho and a 1–1 draw with Ethiopia to finish third in their four-team group.

== FIFA Goal programme ==
In 2006, a new technical centre in Mahé was opened, with help from the FIFA Goal programme. The project had a total cost of approximately 750,000 USD. James Michel, president of the Seychelles, was present at the inauguration. The technical centre houses the SFF headquarters, an auditorium, 20 bedrooms, two massage rooms, changing rooms and a restaurant. The centre is located next to the turf pitches that were also installed by the Goal programme in 2003.

<doc id="1263595" wikidata="Q290948" url="?curid=1263595" title="Ancyloceratina">
<text>The Ancyloceratina were a diverse suborder of ammonite most closely related to the ammonites of order Lytoceratina. They evolved during the Late Jurassic but were not very common until the Cretaceous period, when they rapidly diversified and became one of the most distinctive components of Cretaceous marine faunas. They have been recorded from every continent and many are used as zonal or index fossils. The most distinctive feature of the majority of the Ancyloceratina is the tendency for most of them to have shells that are not regular spirals like most other ammonites. These irregularly-coiled ammonites are called heteromorph ammonites, in contrast to regularly coiled ammonites, which are called homomorph ammonites.

==Biology==
The biology of the heteromorph ammonites is not clear, but one certainty is that their uncoiled shells would have made these forms very poor swimmers. Open shells, particularly ones with spines and ribs, create a lot of drag; but more importantly, the orientation of the shell, with the body hanging below the buoyant part of the shell, would have created a serious impediment to efficient swimming. It&#x27;s more likely these ammonites either drifted in the plankton, collecting small animals on long tentacles like modern jellyfish, or else they crawled along the sea floor feeding on sessile or slow-moving animals such as clams.

==Morphology==

Ancyloceratida varied widely in size, ranging from diminutive &quot;Ptychoceras&quot;, which was barely long, to &quot;Baculites&quot; and &quot;Diplomoceras&quot;, which could grow to in length. Some species were very widely distributed, for example some species of &quot;Hamites&quot; can be found in Eurasia, South America, Australia, and Antarctica. Others, like those inhabiting the Western Interior Seaway that covered much of the US, were much more localized.

In the more primitive forms, the shell departs only slightly from being a perfect spiral, with only the last, outermost whorl being open, forming a hook underneath the main spiral. In such forms the spiral was the chambered, buoyant part of the shell, and the hook was the living chamber in which the soft body of the ammonite resided. Examples of such types were &quot;Ancyloceras&quot;, &quot;Protanisoceras&quot;, and &quot;Tropaeum&quot;. The more advanced heteromorphs departed from such forms radically. The shells of &quot;Ptychoceras&quot; consisted of three or four shafts squashed together and connected with tight, 180 degree bends. Members of the genus &quot;Hamites&quot; were much larger but had a similar sort of shape, though the shafts were open so that the whole thing looked rather like a big paper clip.

Many of the earlier heteromorph forms had regularly coiled shells barely distinguishable from the homomorph ammonites (for example, the Lower Cretaceous genus &quot;Deshayesites&quot;). Some offshoots of the uncoiled varieties even went back to being regularly coiled. Most notable among these were the &quot;Scaphites&quot;, &quot;Hoploscaphites&quot; and their relatives, which were mostly regular spirals in shape except for a very slight hook at the end.

The Late Cretaceous enjoyed the widest variety of heteromorphs, including the straight-shelled &quot;Baculites&quot; and &quot;Sciponoceras&quot;; the helically coiled &quot;Turrilites&quot;; and the bizarre &quot;Nipponites&quot;, which looked more like a ball of string than anything else. Some forms combined different coiling modes. For example, &quot;Nostoceras&quot; started off with a helix like a &quot;Turrilites&quot;, but had a planar hook hanging underneath, more like an &quot;Ancyloceras&quot;.

The thin shelled heteromorphic ammonites probably lived at depths .

<text>Sir Paul Alfred Reeves, (6 December 1932 – 14 August 2011) was a New Zealand clergyman and civil servant, serving as Archbishop and Primate of New Zealand from 1980 to 1985 and 15th Governor-General of New Zealand from 20 November 1985 to 20 November 1990. He was the first governor-general of Māori descent. He also served as the third Chancellor of Auckland University of Technology, from 2005 until his death.

==Early life and education==
Reeves was born in Wellington, New Zealand, on 6 December 1932, the son of D&#x27;arcy Reeves by his marriage to Hilda Pirihira, who had moved from Waikawa to Newtown, a working-class suburb of Wellington. Hilda was of Māori descent, of the Te Āti Awa iwi; D&#x27;arcy was Pākehā and worked for the tramways.
Reeves was educated at Wellington College and at Victoria College, University of New Zealand (now the Victoria University of Wellington), where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1955 and a Master of Arts in 1956. He went on to study for ordination as an Anglican priest at St John&#x27;s College, Auckland, receiving his Licentiate in Theology in 1958.

==Ministry as deacon and priest==
Reeves was ordained deacon in 1958. After serving a brief curacy at Tokoroa, he spent the period 1959–64 in England. From 1959 until 1961 he was an Advanced Student at St Peter&#x27;s College, Oxford (Bachelor of Arts 1961, Master of Arts 1965) as well as Assistant Curate at the University Church of St Mary the Virgin. He was ordained priest in 1960. He served two further curacies in England, first at Kirkley St Peter (1961–63), then at Lewisham St Mary (1963–64).

Returning to New Zealand, Reeves was Vicar of Okato St Paul (1964–66), Lecturer in Church History at St John&#x27;s College, Auckland (1966–69), and Director of Christian Education for the Anglican Diocese of Auckland (1969–71).

==Ministry as bishop, archbishop, and primate==
In 1971 Reeves was appointed Bishop of Waiapu and consecrated to the episcopate on 25 March. He was Bishop of Auckland from 1979 to 1985, and additionally as Archbishop and Primate of New Zealand, the leader of New Zealand&#x27;s Anglicans, from 1980 to 1985.

During this time Reeves also served as chairman of the Environmental Council (1974–76), and he served as president of the National Council of Churches in New Zealand (1984–85).

Reeves was a supporter of Citizens for Rowling (the campaign for the re-election of Labour Prime Minister Bill Rowling).

==Governor-general==

===Appointment===
On the advice of Prime Minister David Lange, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Reeves the 15th Governor-General of New Zealand effective from 20 November 1985. His appointment was met with some scepticism due to his previous political involvement in Citizens for Rowling, opposing the 1981 Springbok Tour, and the fact that he was an Anglican bishop. Leader of the Opposition Jim McLay opposed the appointment on these grounds, asking &quot;How can an ordained priest fulfil that [constitutional] role?&quot; Many Māori groups welcomed the appointment, with Sir James Henare arguing that &quot;It must be a fruit of the Treaty of Waitangi to see a person from our people.&quot; He was the first (and up to the present the only) cleric to hold the post. Moreover, as a member of the Puketapu &quot;hapū&quot; of the Te Āti Awa of Taranaki, he was the first governor-general of Māori descent.

===Tenure===
As a clergyman, Reeves opted not to wear the military uniform of the governor-general. During his term, Reeves joined the Newtown Residents&#x27; Association, and invited members of that association to visit Government House, Wellington. He hosted the first open day at Government House on 7 October 1990, and employed the first public affairs officer, Cindy Beavis, to promote the governor-general&#x27;s role.

Reeves remained in office until 20 November 1990. He was succeeded by Dame Catherine Tizard.

===Controversies===
During Reeves&#x27; tenure, the Fourth Labour Government made radical changes to the New Zealand economy, later known as Rogernomics. In November 1987 Reeves made comments critical of Rogernomics, stating that the reforms were creating &quot;an increasingly stratified society&quot;. He was rebuked for these comments by Lange, but later stated in May 1988 &quot;...the spirit of the market steals life from the vulnerable but the spirit of God gives life to all&quot;. Reeves later recalled that this marked a &quot;parting of ways&quot; with the government.

Reeves also recalled &quot;I had a little sense of being left alone and felt that I needed to be taken into the loop more, or be taken seriously.&quot; Reeves wrote to the Queen, but did not receive replies directly from the Queen. He said, &quot;I used to write to the Queen and express my opinion about this and that going on it the country and I wouldn&#x27;t get a direct reply from her but I would always get a lengthy reply from her private secretary, which I took was expressing her viewpoint.&quot;

On a state visit to Vanuatu in 1988, Reeves was invited to kill a pig at a ceremony, creating controversy as he was patron of the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He later resigned as patron. This was followed by a similar incident when Reeves was a member of a party that shot an endangered bird during a trip to New Zealand&#x27;s sub-Antarctic islands in December 1989. The bird was a light-mantled albatross and protected under the Wildlife Act 1953, however the Department of Conservation Southland operations manager Lou Sanson accepted that the shooting was accidental.

==Retirement==
After his retirement from the viceregal office, Reeves became the Anglican Consultative Council Observer at the United Nations in New York (1991–93) and Assistant Bishop of New York (1991–94). From 1994 until 1995 he served briefly as Dean of Te Whare Wānanga o Te Rau Kahikatea (the theological college of Te Pihopatanga o Aotearoa, and a constituent member of St John&#x27;s College, Auckland). He was also Deputy Leader of the Commonwealth Observer group to South Africa, Chair of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, and Visiting Montague Burton Professor of International Relations at the University of Edinburgh.

Reeves went on to chair the Fiji Constitution Review Commission from 1995 until 1997, culminating in Fiji&#x27;s readmission to the Commonwealth, until its suspension in 2000. On 12 December 2007 it was reported that Reeves was involved with &quot;secret talks&quot; to resolve Fiji&#x27;s year-long political crisis, following the 2006 Fijian coup d&#x27;état.

In 2004, Reeves made a statement in support of New Zealand republic, stating in an interview, &quot;...if renouncing knighthoods was a prerequisite to being a citizen of a republic, I think it would be worth it.&quot;

Reeves served as the Chancellor of the Auckland University of Technology, from February 2005 until August 2011.

In July 2011, Reeves announced that he had been diagnosed with cancer, and therefore was retiring from all public responsibilities. He died from cancer on 14 August 2011, aged 78.

==Honours and other awards==
Reeves was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal (1977), he was appointed a Chaplain of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem in April 1982, Knight Bachelor in the 1985 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George on 6 November 1985, a Knight of Justice of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem in 1986, and a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 2 March 1986. In 1990 he became a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order. Reeves was also made a Companion of the Order of Fiji.

There was some concern regarding Reeves&#x27; using the title &quot;Sir&quot;, as members of the clergy in the Church of England do not usually receive this title when knighted, and the same rule presumably applied to the Anglican Church in New Zealand. Moreover, clergy are traditionally not dubbed. To avoid placing the Queen in an awkward situation (governors-general would by tradition be knighted by her in person at Buckingham Palace), the prime minister of the time, David Lange, made Reeves a Knight Bachelor before meeting her. Consequently, when Reeves went to receive the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George from the Queen, he was already Sir Paul.

On Waitangi Day 2007 Reeves was awarded New Zealand&#x27;s highest honour, being admitted to the Order of New Zealand.

The University of Oxford conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Civil Law in 1985 and his college, St Peter&#x27;s, appointed him an Honorary Fellow in 1981 and a Trustee in 1994. A Fellowship of St John&#x27;s College, Auckland followed in 1989. He has received other honorary degrees, including an LLD of Victoria University of Wellington (1989), a DD of the General Theological Seminary, New York (1992), and the degree of &quot;Doctor Honoris Causa&quot; of the University of Edinburgh (1994).

Changes to the rules in 2006 allowed him to use the style &quot;The Honourable&quot; for life.

<text>Patrol torpedo boat &quot;PT-41 was a of the [[United States Navy]], built by the [[Electric Launch Company]] of [[Bayonne, New Jersey]]. The boat was laid down asMotor Boat Submarine Chaser &quot;PTC-21, but was reclassified as &quot;PT-41&quot; prior to its launch on 8 July 1941, and was completed on 23 July 1941. It was used to evacuate General Douglas MacArthur from Corregidor at the beginning of the war in the Pacific in World War II.

==Boat history==
&quot;PT-41&quot; served as the flagship of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, which was based in the Philippines from late 1941 to April 1942. The commander of Motor Torpedo Boats Squadron 3 was Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley, who became one of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s most highly decorated officers. The Commander of &quot;PT-41&quot; was Ensign George E. Cox, Jr., USNR.

&quot;PT-41&quot; evacuated General (later General of the Army) Douglas MacArthur, Mrs. Jean MacArthur, Arthur MacArthur IV (their four-year-old son), Ah Cheu (Arthur&#x27;s amah), Major General Richard K. Sutherland (United States Army Forces in the Far East Chief of Staff), Captain Herbert J. Ray (USN), Lieutenant Colonel Sidney L. Huff (aide), and Major C.H. Morehouse (medical officer) from Corregidor to Mindanao on 12 March 1942; about the escape he made his famous declaration at Terowie, South Australia: &quot;I came through and I shall return&quot;.

After MacArthur&#x27;s party left Mindanao, &quot;PT-41&quot;, along with the two remaining PT boats of the squadron (&quot;PT-34&quot; and &quot;PT-35&quot;), established a new base of operations at Cagayan de Oro, Mindanao, supporting the American military forces defending Mindanao and the nearby islands from the invading Japanese throughout late March and early April 1942.

After a torpedo attack in concert with on the on 9 April 1942, &quot;PT-41&quot; became the last remaining PT boat of the squadron (&quot;PT-34&quot; was sunk in the aftermath of the attack and &quot;PT-35&quot; was burned at Cebu). With no more torpedoes available for &quot;PT-41&quot; to use, it was commandeered by the United States Army to patrol Lake Lanao, Mindanao. It was destroyed by the Army on 15 April 1942, to prevent its capture while being transported via road to Lake Lanao.

==Popular culture==
The exploits of &quot;PT-41&quot; are portrayed in the 1945 film &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; directed by John Ford with 
Robert Montgomery, John Wayne and Donna Reed.

<doc id="1263603" wikidata="Q4120248" url="?curid=1263603" title="Muhammad Abdel Moneim">
<text>Damat Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim Beyefendi (20 February 1899 – 1 December 1979) was an Egyptian prince and heir apparent to the throne of Egypt and Sudan from 1899 to 1914. Upon the abdication of King Farouk following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, he served as Regent for King Ahmed Fuad II until the declaration of the Republic of Egypt and abolition of the Egyptian and Sudanese monarchy in 1953.

==Early life==
Prince Muhammad Abdul Moneim was born at the Montaza Palace, near Alexandria. His father, Abbas II, was the reigning Khedive, so Prince Muhammad Abdul Moneim became heir apparent upon his birth and was given the title of Hereditary Prince. He was educated at Fribourg, Switzerland. Following the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s entry into World War I, Muhammad Abdul Moneim&#x27;s father, Khedive Abbas II, was deposed by Britain on 18 December 1914 for supporting the Ottomans in the War. His father was replaced on the throne by his uncle Hussein Kamel, bypassing Muhammad Abdul Moneim, who was now demoted in the line of succession. He was created His Highness in 1922.

In 1927, he returned to then Kingdom of Egypt. In 1933, he and his cousin, Prince Youssouf Kamal, visited the United States and Canada. He served as President of the Egyptian Olympic Committee from 1934 until 1938. In 1938, he reportedly asked King Farouk for permission to marry Myzejen Zogu, sister of King Zog I of the Albanians.

In 1939 he was appointed President of the Arab delegation to the Palestine Conference in London.

==Regency==
Following the abdication of King Farouk, Prince Muhammad Abdul Moneim served as Chairman of the Council of Egyptian Regency from 26 July 1952 to 18 June 1953 for the infant King Fuad II, being created Royal Highness in 1952. The regency came to an end when Major General Muhammad Naguib took power and declared Egypt a republic, ending the rule of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty.

In December 1957, he was arrested for attempting to overthrow Nasser and return the monarchy.

==Death==
He died in Ortaköy, Istanbul, and was buried in Cairo.

==Family==
Muhammad Abdul Moneim married his third cousin Princess Fatma Neslişah Osmanoğlu Sultan (4 February 1921 – 2 April 2012) at the Heliopolis Palace, Cairo, on 26 September 1940. She was a daughter of Prince Şehzade Omer Faruk (1898–1969/1971) and his first wife and cousin, Princess Rukiye Sabiha Sultan (1894–1971). Fatma Neslişah was also paternal granddaughter of the last Ottoman Caliph Abdülmecid II by his first wife and maternal granddaughter of the last Ottoman Sultan and Caliph Mehmed VI by his first wife.

Muhammad Abdul Moneim and Fatma Neslişah had two children:
* Prince Sultanzade Abbas Hilmi (b. 16 October 1941 in Cairo), married in Istanbul on 1 June 1969 to Mediha Momtaz (b. 12 May 1945 in Cairo), and has one daughter and one son:
** Princess HGlory Nabila Sabiha Fatima Hilmi Hanım (b. 28 September 1974 in London)
** Prince HGlory Nabil Daoud Abdelmoneim Hilmi Bey (b. 23 July 1979 in Paddington, London)
* Princess İkbal Hilmi Abdulmunim Hanımsultan (b. 22 December 1944), unmarried and without issue

<doc id="1263604" wikidata="Q549576" url="?curid=1263604" title="History of the Jews in Italy">
<text>The history of the Jews in Italy spans more than two thousand years to the present. The Jewish presence in Italy dates to the pre-Christian Roman period and has continued, despite periods of extreme persecution and expulsions, until the present. As of 2019, the estimated core Jewish population in Italy numbers around 45,000.

== Pre-Christian Rome ==

The Jewish community in Rome is likely one of the oldest continuous Jewish communities in the world, existing from classical times until today.

Most certainly, it is known that in 139 BCE, Simon Maccabeus sent a Hasmonean embassy to Rome in order to strengthen his alliance with the Roman Republic against the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom. The ambassadors received a cordial welcome from their coreligionists already established in Rome.

Large numbers of Jews even lived in Rome during the late Roman Republican period (from around 150 BC). They were largely Greek-speaking and poor. As Rome had increasing contact with and military/trade dealings with the Greek-speaking Levant, during the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE, many Greeks, as well as Jews, came to Rome as merchants or were brought there as slaves.

The Romans appear to have viewed the Jews as followers of peculiar, backward religious customs, but antisemitism as it would come to be in the Christian and Islamic worlds did not exist (see Anti-Judaism in the pre-Christian Roman Empire). Despite their disdain, the Romans did recognize and respect the antiquity of the Jews&#x27; religion and the fame of their Temple in Jerusalem (Herod&#x27;s Temple). Many Romans did not know much about Judaism, including the emperor Augustus who, according to his biographer Suetonius, thought that Jews fasted on the sabbath. Julius Caesar was known as a great friend to the Jews, and they were among the first to mourn his assassination.

In Rome, the community was highly organized, and presided over by heads called άρχοντες (&quot;archontes&quot;) or γερουσιάρχοι (&quot;gerousiarchoi&quot;). The Jews maintained in Rome several synagogues, whose spiritual leader was called αρχισυνάγωγος (&quot;archisynagogos&quot;). Their tombstones, mostly in Greek with a few in Hebrew/Aramaic or Latin, were decorated with the ritual menorah (seven-branched candelabrum).

Some scholars have previously argued that Jews in the pre-Christian Roman Empire were active in proselytising Romans in Judaism, leading to an increasing number of outright converts. The new consensus is, that this is not the case. According to Erich S. Gruen, though conversions did happen, there is no evidence of Jews trying to convert Gentiles to Judaism. It has also been argued that some people adopted some Jewish practices and belief in the Jewish God without actually converting (called God-fearers).

The fate of Jews in Rome and Italy fluctuated, with partial expulsions being carried out under the emperors Tiberius and Claudius. After the successive Jewish revolts of 66 and 132 CE, many Judean Jews were brought to Rome as slaves (the norm in the ancient world was for prisoners of war and inhabitants of defeated cities to be sold as slaves). These revolts caused increasing official hostility from the reign of Vespasian onwards. The most serious measure was the Fiscus Judaicus, which was a tax payable by all Jews in the Roman Empire. The new tax replaced the tithe that had formerly been sent to the Temple in Jerusalem (destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE), and was used instead in the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in Rome.

In addition to Rome, there were a significant number of Jewish communities in southern Italy during this period. For example, the regions of Sicily, Calabria, and Apulia had well established Jewish populations.

==Late antiquity==
In late antiquity, Jewish communities in Italy were dispersed across both urban and rural areas. Archaeological discoveries, such as Jewish epitaphs and catacombs, reveal significant Jewish mobility. Jews arrived in Italy from both Palestine and various diaspora communities. The city of Rome, for instance, attracted Jewish migrants from diverse regions, including Sicily, Italy, and the Eastern Mediterranean. Naples, Milan, and Sicily also hosted Jewish communities with diverse origins. For example, Naples saw the immigration of Jews from Venafrum, Rome, Caesarea (likely Caesarea Maritima), and Mauretania, while Milan received Jews from Alexandria. Sicily hosted Jewish migrants from Egypt, and in Venosa, Jews from Lecce and Albania were interred.

With the promotion of Christianity as a legal religion of the Roman Empire by Constantine in 313 (the Edict of Milan), the position of Jews in Italy and throughout the empire declined rapidly and dramatically. Constantine established oppressive laws for the Jews; but these were in turn abolished by Julian the Apostate, who showed his favor toward the Jews to the extent of permitting them to resume their plan for the reconstruction of the Temple at Jerusalem. This concession was withdrawn under his successor, who, again, was a Christian; and then the oppression grew considerably. Nicene Christianity was adopted as the state church of the Roman Empire in 380, shortly before the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

At the time of the foundation of the Ostrogothic rule under Theodoric (493–526), there were flourishing communities of Jews in Rome, Milan, Genoa, Palermo, Messina, Agrigentum, and in Sardinia. The Popes of the period were not seriously opposed to the Jews; and this accounts for the ardor with which the latter took up arms for the Ostrogoths as against the forces of Justinian—particularly at Naples, where the remarkable defense of the city was maintained almost entirely by Jews. After the failure of the various attempts to make Italy a province of the Byzantine empire, the Jews had to suffer much oppression from the Exarch of Ravenna; but it was not long until the greater part of Italy came into the possession of the Lombards (568-774), under whom they lived in peace. Indeed, the Lombards passed no exceptional laws relative to the Jews. Even after the Lombards embraced Catholicism the condition of the Jews was always favorable, because the popes of that time not only did not persecute them, but guaranteed them more or less protection. Pope Gregory I treated them with much consideration. Under succeeding popes the condition of the Jews did not grow worse; and the same was the case in the several smaller states into which Italy was divided. Both popes and states were so absorbed in continual external and internal dissensions that the Jews were left in peace. In every individual state of Italy a certain amount of protection was granted to them in order to secure the advantages of their commercial enterprise. The fact that the historians of this period scarcely make mention of the Jews, suggests that their circumstances were tolerable.

==Middle Ages==

There were several expulsions, including a brief one from Bologna in 1172, and forced conversions: in Trani in 1380 there were four synagogues, transformed into churches at the time of Charles III of Naples, while 310 local Jews were forced to be baptized. A nephew of Rabbi Nathan ben Jehiel acted as administrator of the property of Pope Alexander III, who showed his amicable feelings toward the Jews at the Lateran Council of 1179. He defeated the designs of hostile prelates who advocated anti-Jewish laws. Under Norman rule, the Jews of southern Italy and of Sicily enjoyed even greater freedom; they were considered the equals of Christians, and were permitted to follow any career. They also had jurisdiction over their own affairs. The canonical laws against the Jews were more frequently disregarded in Italy than in any other country or region. A later pope—either Nicholas IV (1288–1292) or Boniface VIII (1294–1303)—had a Jewish physician, Isaac ben Mordecai, nicknamed Maestro Gajo.

===Literary achievement===
Among the early Jews of Italy who left written manuscripts was Shabbethai Donnolo (died 982). Two centuries later (1150), poets Shabbethai ben Moses of Rome; his son Jehiel Kalonymus, once regarded as a Talmudic authority even beyond Italy; and Rabbi Jehiel of the Mansi (Anaw) family, also of Rome, became known for their works. Nathan, son of the above-mentioned Rabbi Jehiel, was the author of a Talmudic lexicon (&quot;&#x27;Aruk&quot;) that became the key to the study of the Talmud.

During his residence at Salerno, Solomon ben Abraham ibn Parhon compiled a Hebrew dictionary. This encouraged Italian Jews to study Biblical exegesis. On the whole, however, Hebrew literary culture was not flourishing. The only liturgical author of merit was Joab ben Solomon, some of whose compositions are extant.

Toward the second half of the 13th century, signs appeared of a better Hebrew culture and of a more profound study of the Talmud. Isaiah di Trani the Elder (1232–1279), a high Talmudic authority, wrote many celebrated responsa. David, his son, and Isaiah di Trani the Younger, his nephew, followed in his footsteps, as did their descendants until the end of the seventeenth century. Meïr ben Moses presided over an important Talmudic school in Rome, and Abraham ben Joseph over one in Pesaro. In Rome two famous physicians, Abraham and Jehiel, descendants of Nathan ben Jehiel, taught the Talmud. Paola dei Mansi, one of the women of this gifted family, also attained distinction; she had considerable knowledge of the Bible and Talmud, and she transcribed Biblical commentaries in a notably beautiful handwriting (see Jew. Encyc. i. 567, s.v. Paola Anaw).

During this period, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, the last of the Hohenstaufen, employed Jews to translate from the Arabic philosophical and astronomical treatises. Among the translators were Judah ben Solomon ha-Kohen of Toledo, later of Tuscany, and Jacob Anatoli of Provence. This encouragement naturally led to the study of the works of Maimonides—particularly of the &quot;Moreh Nebukim&quot;—the favorite writer of Hillel of Verona (1220–1295). This last-named litterateur and philosopher practised medicine at Rome and in other Italian cities, and translated several medical works into Hebrew. The liberal spirit of the writings of Maimonides had other votaries in Italy; e.g., Shabbethai ben Solomon of Rome and Zerahiah Ḥen of Barcelona, who migrated to Rome and contributed much to spread the knowledge of his works. The effect of this on the Italian Jews was apparent in their love of freedom of thought and their esteem for literature, as well as in their adherence to the literal rendering of the Biblical texts and their opposition to fanatical cabalists and mystic theories. Among other devotees of these theories was Immanuel ben Solomon of Rome, the celebrated friend of Dante Aligheri. The discord between the followers of Maimonides and his opponents wrought most serious damage to the interests of Judaism.

The rise of poetry in Italy at the time of Dante influenced the Jews also. The rich and the powerful, partly by reason of sincere interest, partly in obedience to the spirit of the times, became patrons of Jewish writers, thus inducing the greatest activity on their part. This activity was particularly noticeable at Rome, where a new Jewish poetry arose, mainly through the works of Leo Romano, translator of the writings of Thomas Aquinas and author of exegetical works of merit; of Judah Siciliano, a writer in rimed prose; of Kalonymus ben Kalonymus, a famous satirical poet; and especially of the above-mentioned Immanuel. On the initiative of the Roman community, a Hebrew translation of Maimonides&#x27; Arabic commentary on the Mishnah was made. At this time Pope John XXII was on the point of pronouncing a ban against the Jews of Rome. The Jews instituted a day of public fasting and of prayer to appeal for divine assistance. King Robert of Sicily, who favored the Jews, sent an envoy to the pope at Avignon, who succeeded in averting this great peril. Immanuel himself described this envoy as a person of high merit and of great culture. This period of Jewish literature in Italy is indeed one of great splendor. After Immanuel there were no other Jewish writers of importance until Moses da Rieti (1388).

===Worsening conditions under Innocent III===

The position of Jews in Italy worsened considerably under Pope Innocent III (1198–1216). This pope threatened with excommunication those who placed or maintained Jews in public positions, and he insisted that every Jew holding office should be dismissed. The deepest insult was the order that every Jew must always wear, conspicuously displayed, a special yellow badge.
In 1235 Pope Gregory IX published the first bull against the ritual murder accusation. Other popes followed his example, particularly Innocent IV in 1247, Gregory X in 1272, Clement VI in 1348, Gregory XI in 1371, Martin V in 1422, Nicholas V in 1447, Sixtus V in 1475, Paul III in 1540, and later Alexander VII, Clement XIII, and Clement XIV.

===Antipope Benedict XIII===
The Jews suffered much from the relentless persecutions of the Avignon-based antipope Benedict XIII. They hailed his successor, Martin V, with delight. The synod convoked by the Jews at Bologna, and continued at Forlì, sent a deputation with costly gifts to the new pope, praying him to abolish the oppressive laws promulgated by Benedict and to grant the Jews those privileges which had been accorded them under previous popes. The deputation succeeded in its mission, but the period of grace was short; for Martin&#x27;s successor, Eugenius IV, at first favorably disposed toward the Jews, ultimately reenacted all the restrictive laws issued by Benedict. In Italy, however, his bull was generally disregarded. The great centers, such as Venice, Florence, Genoa, and Pisa, realized that their commercial interests were of more importance than the affairs of the spiritual leaders of the Church; and accordingly the Jews, many of whom were bankers and leading merchants, found their condition better than ever before. It thus became easy for Jewish bankers to obtain permission to establish banks and to engage in monetary transactions. Indeed, in one instance even the Bishop of Mantua, in the name of the pope, accorded permission to the Jews to lend money at interest. All the banking negotiations of Tuscany were in the hands of a Jew, Jehiel of Pisa. The influential position of this successful financier was of the greatest advantage to his coreligionists at the time of the exile from Spain.

The Jews were also successful as skilled medical practitioners. William of Portaleone, physician to King Ferdinand I of Naples, and to the ducal houses of Sforza and Gonzaga, was one of the ablest of that time. He was the first of the long line of illustrious physicians in his family.

==Early modern period==
It is estimated that in 1492 Jews made up between 3% and 6% of the population of Sicily. Many Sicilian Jews first went to Calabria, which already had a Jewish community since the 4th century. In 1524 Jews were expelled from Calabria, and in 1540 from the entire Kingdom of Naples, as all these areas fell under Spanish rule and were subject to the edict of expulsion by the Spanish Inquisition.

Throughout the 16th century, Jews gradually moved from the south of Italy to the north, with conditions worsening for Jews in Rome after 1556 and the Venetian Republic in the 1580s. Many Jews from Venice and the surrounding area migrated to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth at this time.

===Refugees from Spain===
When Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, many of them found refuge in Italy, where they were given protection by King Ferdinand I of Naples. One of the refugees, Don Isaac Abravanel, even received a position at the Neapolitan court, which he retained under the succeeding king, Alfonso II. The Spanish Jews were also well received in Ferrara by Duke Ercole d&#x27;Este I and in Tuscany through the mediation of Jehiel of Pisa and his sons. But at Rome and Genoa they experienced all the vexations and torments that hunger, plague, and poverty bring with them, and they were forced to accept baptism to escape starvation. In a few cases, the refugees exceeded in number the Jews already domiciled, and thus gave the determining vote in matters of communal interest and in the direction of studies.

Popes Alexander VI to Clement VII were indulgent toward Jews, having more urgent matters to occupy them. After the 1492 expulsion of Jews from Spain, some 9,000 impoverished Spanish Jews arrived at the borders of the Papal States. Alexander VI welcomed them into Rome, declaring that they were &quot;permitted to lead their life, free from interference from Christians, to continue in their own rites, to gain wealth, and to enjoy many other privileges.&quot; He similarly allowed the immigration of Jews expelled from Portugal in 1497 and from Provence in 1498.

The popes and many of the most influential cardinals openly violated one of the most severe enactments of the Council of Basel, namely, that prohibiting Christians from employing Jewish physicians; they even gave the latter positions at the papal court. The Jewish communities of Naples and of Rome received the greatest number of accessions; but many Jews passed on from these cities to Ancona, Venice, Calabria, and thence to Florence and Padua. Venice, imitating the odious measures of the German cities, assigned to the Jews a special quarter (ghetto).

===Expulsion from Naples===
The ultra-Catholic party tried with all the means at its disposal to introduce the Inquisition into the Neapolitan realm, then under Spanish rule. Charles V, upon his return from his victories in Africa, was on the point of exiling the Jews from Naples when Benvenida, wife of Samuel Abravanel, caused him to defer the action. A few years later, in 1533, a similar decree was proclaimed, but upon this occasion also Samuel Abravanel and others were able through their influence to avert for several years the execution of the edict. Many Jews repaired to the Ottoman Empire, some to Ancona, and still others to Ferrara, where they were received graciously by Duke Ercole II.

After the death of Pope Paul III (1534–1549), who had showed favor to the Jews, a period of strife, persecution, and despondency set in. A few years later the Jews were exiled from Genoa, among the refugees being Joseph Hakohen, physician to the doge Andrea Doria and eminent historian. Duke Ercole allowed the Marranos, driven from Spain and Portugal, to enter his dominions and to profess Judaism freely and openly. Samuel Usque, also a historian, who had fled from the Portuguese Inquisition, settled in Ferrara, and Abraham Usque founded a large printing establishment there. A third Usque, Solomon, merchant of Venice and Ancona and poet of some note, translated the sonnets of Petrarch into excellent Spanish verse, and this work was much admired by his contemporaries.

Although the return to Judaism of the Marrano Usques caused much rejoicing among the Italian Jews, this was counterbalanced by the deep grief into which they were plunged by the conversion to Christianity of two grandsons of Elijah Levita, Leone Romano and Vittorio Eliano. One became a canon of the Church; the other, a Jesuit. They heavily criticized the Talmud to Pope Julius III and the Inquisition; as a consequence the pope pronounced a sentence of destruction against this work, to the printing of which one of his predecessors, Leo X, had given his sanction. On the Jewish New Year Day (9 September) in 1553, all the copies of the Talmud in the principal cities of Italy, in the printing establishments of Venice, and even in the distant island of Candia (Crete), were burned. He was restrained from the execution of the scheme by Cardinal Alexander Farnese who succeeded in bringing to light the true culprit.

===Paul IV===
Marcellus&#x27; successor, Paul IV, confirmed all the bulls against the Jews issued up to that time and added more oppressive measures, including a variety of prohibitions designed to condemn Jews to abject misery, depriving them of the means of sustenance, and denying them the exercise of all professions. The papal bull &quot;Cum nimis absurdum&quot; of 1555 created the Roman ghetto and required the wearing of yellow badges. The Jews were also forced to labor at the restoration of the walls of Rome without any compensation.

&quot;Cum nimis absurdum&quot; limited each ghetto in the Papal States to one synagogue. In the early 16th century, there were at least seven synagogues across Rome, each serving as the house of worship for distinct demographic subgroup: Roman Jews (&quot;Benè Romì&quot;), Sicilian Jews, Italian Jews (that were neither Benè Romì nor Sicilian), German Ashkenazim, French Provençal, Castilian Sephardim, and Catalan Sephardim.

Many Jews abandoned Rome and Ancona and went to Ferrara and Pesaro. Here the Duke of Urbino welcomed them graciously in the hope of directing the extensive commerce of the Levant to the new port of Pesaro, which was, at that time, exclusively in the hands of the Jews of Ancona. Among the many who were forced to leave Rome was the Marano Amato Lusitano, a distinguished physician, who had often attended Pope Julius III. He had even been invited to become physician to the King of Poland, but had declined the offer in order to remain in Italy.

===Expulsion from Papal States===
Paul IV was followed by the tolerant pope Pius IV, who was succeeded by Pius V, who restored all the anti-Jewish bulls of his predecessors—not only in his own immediate domains, but throughout the Christian world. In Lombardy, the expulsion of the Jews was threatened, and, although this extreme measure was not put into execution, they were tyrannized in countless ways. At Cremona and at Lodi their books were confiscated. In Genoa, from which the Jews were expelled at this time, an exception was made in favor of Joseph Hakohen. In his &quot;Emek Habachah&quot; he narrates the history of these persecutions. He had no desire to take advantage of the exception, though, and went to Casale Monferrato, where he was graciously received even by the Christians. In this same year the pope directed his persecutions against the Jews of Bologna. Many of the wealthiest Jews were imprisoned and tortured to force false confessions from them. When Rabbi Ishmael Ḥanina was being racked, he declared that should the pains of torture elicit from him any words that might be construed as casting reflection on Judaism, they would be false and null. Jews were forbidden to leave the city, but many succeeded in escaping by bribing the watchmen at the gates of the ghetto and of the city. The fugitives, together with their wives and children, repaired to the neighboring city of Ferrara. Then Pius V decided to banish the Jews from all his dominions, and, despite the enormous loss which was likely to result from this measure, and the remonstrances of influential and well-meaning cardinals, the Jews (in all about 1,000 families) were actually expelled from all the Papal States excepting Rome and Ancona. A few became Christians. The majority found refuge in other parts of Italy, e.g. Leghorn and Pitigliano.

===Approval within the Republic of Venice===
A great sensation was caused in Italy by the choice of a prominent Jew, Solomon of Udine, as Turkish ambassador to Venice who was selected to negotiate within that republic during July 1574. There was a pending decree of expulsion of the Jews by the leaders of several kingdoms within Italy, thereby making the Venetian Senate concerned if whether there would be difficulties collaborating with Solomon of Udine. However, through the influence of the Venetian diplomats themselves, and particularly of the Patrician, Marcantonio Barbaro of the noble Barbaro family, who esteemed Udine highly, Solomon was received with great honors at the Doge&#x27;s Palace. In virtue of this, Udine received an exalted position within the Republic of Venice and was able to render great service to his coreligionists. Through his influence Jacob Soranzo, an agent of the Venetian Republic at Constantinople, came to Venice. Solomon was influential in having the decree of expulsion revoked within Italian kingdoms, and he furthermore obtained a promise from Venetian patricians that Jews would have a secure home within the Republic of Venice. Udine was eventually honored for his services and returned to Constantinople, leaving his son Nathan in Venice to be educated. Nathan was one of the first Jewish students to have studied at the University of Padua, under the inclusive admission policy established by Marcantonio Barbaro. The success of Udine inspired many Jews in the Ottoman Empire, particularly in Constantinople, where they had attained great prosperity.

===Persecutions and confiscations===
The position of the Jews of Italy at this time was pitiable; pope Paul IV and Pius V reduced them to the utmost humiliation and had materially diminished their numbers. In southern Italy there were almost none left; in each of the important communities of Rome, Venice, and Mantua there were about 2,000 Jews; while in all Lombardy there were hardly 1,000. Gregory XIII was not less fanatical than his predecessors; he noticed that, despite papal prohibition, Christians employed Jewish physicians; he therefore strictly prohibited the Jews from attending Christian patients, and threatened with the most severe punishment alike Christians who should have recourse to Hebrew practitioners, and Jewish physicians who should respond to the calls of Christians. Furthermore, the slightest assistance given to the Maranos of Portugal and Spain, in violation of the canonical laws, was sufficient to deliver the guilty one into the power of the Inquisition, which did not hesitate to condemn the accused to death. Gregory also induced the Inquisition to consign to the flames a large number of copies of the Talmud and of other Hebrew books. Special sermons, designed to convert the Jews, were instituted; and at these at least one-third of the Jewish community, men, women, and youths above the age of twelve, was forced to be present. The sermons were usually delivered by baptized Jews who had become friars or priests; and not infrequently the Jews, without any chance of protest, were forced to listen to such sermons in their own synagogues. These cruelties forced many Jews to leave Rome, and thus their number was still further diminished.

===Varied fortunes===
Under the following pope, Sixtus V (1585–1590), the condition of the Jews was somewhat improved. He repealed many of the regulations established by his predecessors, permitted Jews to reside in all parts of his realm, and gave Jewish physicians freedom to practice their profession. David de Pomis, an eminent physician, profited by this privilege and published a work in Latin, entitled &quot;De Medico Hebraeo&quot;, dedicated to Duke Francis of Urbino, in which he proved to the Jews their obligation to consider the Christians as brothers, to assist them, and to attend them. The Jews of Mantua, Milan, and Ferrara, taking advantage of the favorable disposition of the pope, sent to him an ambassador, Bezaleel Massarano, with a present of 2,000 scudi, to obtain from him permission to reprint the Talmud and other Jewish books, promising at the same time to expurgate all passages considered offensive to Christianity. Their demand was granted, partly through the support given by Lopez, a Marano, who administered the papal finances and who was in great favor with the pontiff. Scarcely had the reprinting of the Talmud been begun, and the conditions of its printing been arranged by the commission, when Sixtus died. His successor, Gregory XIV, was as well disposed to the Jews as Sixtus had been; but during his short pontificate he was almost always ill. Clement VIII (1592–1605), who succeeded him, renewed the anti-Jewish bulls of Paul IV and Pius V, and exiled the Jews from all his territories with the exception of Rome, Ancona, and Avignon; but, in order not to lose the commerce with the East, he gave certain privileges to the Turkish Jews. The exiles repaired to Tuscany, where they were favorably received by Duke Ferdinand dei Medici, who assigned to them the city of Pisa for residence, and by Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga, at whose court Joseph da Fano, a Jew, was a favorite. They were again permitted to read the Talmud and other Hebrew books, provided that they were printed according to the rules of censorship approved by Sixtus V. From Italy, where these expurgated books were printed by thousands, they were sent to the Jews of other various countries.

Giuseppe Ciante (d. 1670), a leading Hebrew expert of his day and professor of theology and philosophy at the College of Saint Thomas in Rome was appointed in 1640 by Pope Urban VIII to the mission of preaching to the Jews of Rome (&quot;Predicatore degli Ebrei&quot;) in order to promote their conversion.&quot; In the mid-1650s Ciantes wrote a &quot;monumental bilingual edition of the first three Parts of Thomas Aquinas&#x27; &quot;Summa contra Gentiles&quot;, which includes the original Latin text and a Hebrew translation prepared by Ciantes, assisted by Jewish apostates, the &quot;Summa divi Thomae Aquinatis ordinis praedicatorum Contra Gentiles quam Hebraicè eloquitur...&quot;. Until the present this remains the only significant translation of a major Latin scholastic work in modern Hebrew.&quot;

===In the ducal dominions===
It was strange that under Philip II the Jews exiled from all parts of Spain were tolerated in the Duchy of Milan, then under Spanish rule. Such an inconsistency of policy was designed to work ill for the interests of the Jews. To avert this misfortune an eloquent ambassador, Samuel Coen, was sent to the king at Alessandria; but he was unsuccessful in his mission. The king, persuaded by his confessor, expelled the Jews from Milanese territory in the spring of 1597. The exiles, numbering about 1,000, were received at Mantua, Modena, Reggio, Verona, and Padua. The princes of the house of Este had always accorded favor and protection to the Jews, and were much beloved by them. Eleonora, a princess of this house, had inspired two Jewish poets; and when she was ill public prayers were said in the synagogues for her restoration to health. But misfortune overtook the Jews of Ferrara as well; for when Alfonso II., the last of the Este family, died, the Principality of Ferrara was incorporated in the dominions of the Church under Clement VIII., who decreed the banishment of the Jews. Aldobrandini, a relative of the pope, took possession of Ferrara in the pontiff&#x27;s name. Seeing that all the commerce was in the hands of the Jews, he complied with their request for an exemption of five years from the decree, although this was much against the pope&#x27;s wish.

The Mantuan Jews suffered seriously at the time of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The Jews exiled from the papal dominions had repeatedly found refuge in Mantua, where the dukes of Gonzaga had accorded protection to them, as they had done to the Jews already resident there. The next to the last duke, although a cardinal, favored them sufficiently to enact a statute for the maintenance of order in the ghetto. After the death of the last of this house the right of succession was contested at the time of the Thirty Years&#x27; war, and the city was besieged by the German soldiery of Wallenstein. After a valiant defense, in which the Jews labored at the walls until the approach of the Sabbath, the city fell into the power of the besiegers, and for three days was at the mercy of fire and sword. The commander-in-chief, Altringer, forbade the soldiers to sack the ghetto, thereby hoping to secure the spoils for himself. The Jews were ordered to leave the city, taking with them only their personal clothing and three gold ducats per capita. There were retained enough Jews to act as guides to the places where their coreligionists were supposed to have hidden their treasures. Through three Jewish zealots these circumstances came to the knowledge of the emperor, who ordered the governor, Collalto, to issue a decree permitting the Jews to return and promising them the restoration of their goods. Only about 800, however, returned, the others having died.

The victories in Europe of the Turks, who brought their armies up to the very walls of Vienna in a 1683 siege, helped even in Italy to incite the Christian population against the Jews, who remained friendly to the Ottoman Empire. In Padua, in 1683, the Jews were in great danger because of the agitation fomented against them by the cloth-weavers. A violent tumult broke out; the lives of the Jews were seriously menaced; and it was only with the greatest difficulty that the governor of the city succeeded in rescuing them, in obedience to a rigorous order from Venice. For several days thereafter the ghetto had to be especially guarded.

==Reaction after Napoleon==
Among the first schools to adopt the Reform projects of Hartwig Wessely were those of Trieste, Venice, and Ferrara. Under the influence of the liberal religious policy of Napoleon I, the Jews of Italy, like those of France, were emancipated. The supreme power of the popes was broken: they no longer had time to give to framing anti-Jewish enactments, and they no longer directed canonical laws against the Jews.

To the Sanhedrin convened by Napoleon at Paris (1807), Italy sent four deputies: Abraham Vita da Cologna; Isaac Benzion Segre, rabbi of Vercelli; Graziadio Neppi, physician and rabbi of Cento; and Jacob Israel Karmi, rabbi of Reggio. Of the four rabbis assigned to the committee which was to draw up the answers to the twelve questions proposed to the Assembly of Notables, two, Cologna and Segre, were Italians, and were elected respectively first and second vice-presidents of the Sanhedrin. But the liberty acquired by the Jews under Napoleon was of short duration; it disappeared with his downfall.

Pope Pius VII, on regaining possession of his realms, reinstalled the Inquisition; he deprived the Jews of every liberty and confined them again in ghettos. Such became to a greater or less extent their condition in all the states into which Italy was then divided; in Rome they were again forced to listen to proselytizing sermons.

In the year 1829, consequent upon an edict of the Emperor Francis I, there was opened in Padua, with the cooperation of Venice, of Verona, and of Mantua, the first Italian rabbinical college, in which Lelio della Torre and Samuel David Luzzatto taught. Luzzatto was a man of great intellect; he wrote in pure Hebrew upon philosophy, history, literature, criticism, and grammar. Many distinguished rabbis came from the rabbinical college of Padua. Zelman, Moses Tedeschi, and Castiglioni followed at Trieste the purposes and the principles of Luzzatto&#x27;s school. At the same time, Elijah Benamozegh, a man of great knowledge and the author of several works, distinguished himself in the old rabbinical school at Leghorn.

==Nineteenth century==
The return to medieval servitude after the Italian restoration did not last long; and the Revolution of 1848, which convulsed all Europe, brought great advantages to the Jews. Although this was followed by restoration of the Papal States only four months later, in early 1849, yet the persecutions and the violence of past times had to a large extent disappeared. The last outrage against the Jews of Italy was connected with the case of Edgardo Mortara, which occurred in Bologna in 1858. In 1859 most of the papal states were annexed into the united Kingdom of Italy under King Victor Emanuel II. Except in and near Rome, where oppression lasted until the end of the papal dominion (20 September 1870), the Jews obtained full emancipation. In behalf of their country the Jews with great ardor sacrificed life and property in the memorable campaigns of 1859, 1866, and 1870. Of the many who deserve mention in this connection may be singled out Isaac Pesaro Maurogonato. He was minister of finance to the self-proclaimed Venetian Republic of San Marco (whose president, Daniele Manin came from a Jewish family that had converted to Christianity in 1759) during the war of 1848 against Austria, and his grateful country erected to him a memorial in bronze. Also erected in the palace of the doges there was a marble bust of Samuele Romanin, a celebrated Jewish historian of Venice. Florence, too, has commemorated a modern Jewish poet, Solomon Fiorentino, by placing a marble tablet upon the house in which he was born. The secretary and faithful friend of Count Cavour was the Piedmontese Isaac Artom; while L&#x27;Olper, later rabbi of Turin, and also the friend and counselor of Mazzini, was one of the most courageous advocates of Italian independence. The names of the Jewish soldiers who died in the cause of Italian liberty were placed along with those of their Christian fellow soldiers on the monuments erected in their honour.

==Twentieth century==

===Early twentieth century===

Italian prime minister Luigi Luzzatti, who took office in 1910, was one of the world&#x27;s first Jewish heads of government (not converted to Christianity). Another Jew, Ernesto Nathan served as mayor of Rome from 1907 to 1913. By 1902, out of 350 senators, there were six Jews. By 1920, there were nineteen Jewish senators.

Pope John Paul II gave access to some formerly secret Vatican Archives to scholars, one of whom, David Kertzer, used information thus obtained in his book &quot;The Popes Against the Jews&quot;. According to that book, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the popes and many Catholic bishops and Catholic publications consistently made a distinction between &quot;good anti-Semitism&quot; and &quot;bad anti-Semitism&quot;. The &quot;bad&quot; kind directed hatred against Jews merely because of their descent. That was considered un-Christian, in part because the church held that its message was for all of mankind equally, and any person of any ancestry could become a Christian. The &quot;good&quot; kind denounced alleged Jewish plots to gain control of the world by controlling newspapers, banks, schools, etc., or otherwise attributed various evils to Jews. Kertzer&#x27;s book details many instances in which Catholic publications denounced such alleged plots, and then, when criticized for inciting hatred of Jews, would remind people that the Catholic Church condemned the &quot;bad&quot; kind of anti-Semitism.

Approximately 5,000 Italian Jews were conscripted to the Royal Italian Army during World War I and about half of them served as officers (this was due to the average higher level of education among Italian Jews). About 420 were killed in action or went missing in action; about 700 received military decorations.

===Jews during the Fascist era===

Jews fervently supported the &quot;Risorgimento,&quot; identified as Italian nationalists, proved valiant as soldiers in World War I, and, in terms of their relatively small numerical presence within the general population, they later went on to form a disproportionate part of the Fascist Party from its beginnings down to 1938.

In 1929, Mussolini acknowledged the contributions which Italian Jews had made to Italian society, despite their minority status, and he also believed that Jewish culture was Mediterranean, aligning his early opinion of Italian Jews with his early Mediterraneanist perspective. He also argued that Jews were natives of Italy, after living on the Italian Peninsula for a long period of time. In the early 1930s, Mussolini held discussions with Zionist leadership figures over proposals to encourage the emigration of Italian Jews to the mandate of Palestine, as Mussolini hoped that the presence of pro-Italian Jews in the region would weaken pro-British sentiment and potentially overturn the British mandate.

Until Benito Mussolini&#x27;s alliance with Adolf Hitler, he had always denied any antisemitism within the National Fascist Party (PNF). In the early 1920s, Mussolini wrote an article which stated that Fascism would never elevate a &quot;Jewish Question&quot; and that &quot;Italy knows no antisemitism and we believe that it will never know it&quot; and then elaborated &quot;let us hope that Italian Jews will continue to be sensible enough so as not to give rise to antisemitism in the only country where it has never existed&quot;. In 1932 during a conversation with Emil Ludwig, Mussolini described antisemitism as a &quot;German vice&quot; and stated: &quot;There was &#x27;no Jewish Question&#x27; in Italy and could not be one in a country with a healthy system of government&quot;. On several occasions, Mussolini spoke positively about Jews and the Zionist movement. Mussolini had initially rejected Nazi racism, especially the idea of a master race, as &quot;arrant nonsense, stupid and idiotic&quot;.

Mussolini originally distinguished his position from Hitler&#x27;s fanatical racism while affirming that he himself was a Zionist. More broadly, he even proposed building a mosque in Rome as a sign that Italy was the Protector of Islam, a move blocked by a horrified Pope. German propagandists often derided what they called Italy&#x27;s &quot;Kosher Fascism&quot;. There were however some Fascists, Roberto Farinacci and Giovanni Preziosi being prime examples, who held fringe and extremely racist views before Fascist Italy formed its alliance with Nazi Germany. Preziosi was the first to publish an Italian edition of the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, in 1921, which was published almost simultaneously with a version issued by Umberto Benigni in supplements to &quot;Fede e Ragione.&quot;. However, the book had little impact until the mid-1930s.

It has also been indicated that Benito Mussolini had his own, if somewhat different from Nazism, brand of racist views. Mussolini attempted to reconcile the divisive racial discourse which had developed within the nation by asserting that he had already resolved the Southern question and as a result, he asserted that all Italians, not just Northerners, belonged to the &quot;dominant race&quot; which was the Aryan race.

Mussolini originally held the view that a small contingent of Italian Jews had lived in Italy &quot;since the days of the Kings of Rome&quot; (a reference to the Bené Roma) and as a result, they should &quot;remain undisturbed&quot;. One of Mussolini&#x27;s mistresses, Margherita Sarfatti, was Jewish. There were even some Jews in the National Fascist Party, such as Ettore Ovazza who founded the Jewish Fascist paper &quot;La Nostra Bandiera&quot; in 1935. Mussolini once declared &quot;Anti-Semitism does not exist in Italy... Italians of Jewish birth have shown themselves good citizens and they fought bravely in [World War I].&quot;

Despite the presence of a Fascist regime, some Jewish refugees considered Italy a safe haven in the first half of the 1930s. During that period, the country hosted up to 11,000 persecuted Jews, including 2,806 Jews who were of German descent. However, as early as 1934, Jewish personnel were removed from institutions and state organizations. 1934 also saw press campaigns against anti-fascist Jews, in which they were equated with Zionists. Between 1936 and 1938, the Fascist regime-endorsed anti-Semitic propaganda was mounting in the press and it was even mounting in graffiti. Equally, scholars of eugenetics, statistics, anthropology and demographics began to outline racist theories.

The anti-Semitic metamorphosis of Fascism culminated in the racial laws of 18 September 1938. Although they did not directly threaten Jewish lives, these laws excluded Jews from public education, the military and the government, and they also made it practically impossible for them to engage in most economic activities. Jews could not hire non-Jews. Marriages between Jews and non-Jews were also prohibited. Not all Italian Fascists supported discrimination: while the pro-German, anti-Jewish Roberto Farinacci and Giovanni Preziosi strongly pushed for them, Italo Balbo and Dino Grandi strongly opposed the Racial Laws. Balbo, in particular, regarded antisemitism as having nothing to do with fascism and staunchly opposed the antisemitic laws.

At least until the promulgation of the 1938 racial laws, a number of Italian Jews were sympathetic to the regime and occupied significant offices and positions in politics and economy. It is estimated that 230 Italian Jews participated in the October 1922 March on Rome that brought about Mussolini&#x27;s ascent to power. The 1938 Italian census recorded 590 Jewish &quot;old fighters&quot; who had joined the National Fascist Party before its seizure of power in 1922.

Examples of Italian Jews that operated within the regime until the enactment of the racial laws include Giorgio Morpurgo (lieutenant colonel, staff officer of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie), Aldo Finzi, Renzo Ravenna (podestà of Ferrara and personal friend of Italo Balbo), Ettore Ovazza and Guido Jung (the latter however eventually converted to Christianity in 1938). Furthermore, Margherita Sarfatti, a writer and socialite, was a close friend and possibly mistress of Mussolini and a propaganda and political adviser of his. She authored the popular biography of the Italian dictator entitled &quot;Dux&quot;. Giorgio Bassani, a Jewish Italian author, has given an insight into the life of the Jewish middle class during the Fascist regime. Michele Sarfatti has written a thorough compendium of the situation of the Italian Jewish community under the fascist regime in his book &quot;The Jews in Mussolini&#x27;s Italy: from equality to persecution&quot;. On the other hand, a significant number of Italian Jews were also active in anti-fascist organizations, and some joined the Resistenza: among them the most significant were the brothers Carlo and Nello Rosselli, Franco Momigliano, Leone Ginzburg and the brothers Ennio and Emanuele Artom.

The Fascist regime also helped, at the request of Vladimir Jabotinski, the establishment in 1934 of a navy officer training camp in Civitavecchia for Mandatory Palestine Jews, laying the foundations of the Israeli Navy. By helping the Zionist cause, Mussolini hoped to gain influence in the Middle East at the expense of the British Empire.

The Italian colonial authorities in Ethiopia after the conquest of this African state came into contact with the Beta Israel community and greatly favoured them, enacting special laws to protect them from offences and violences routinely committed against them by Christian and Muslim Ethiopians. The regime also encouraged cultural exchanges between the Italian Jewish community and the Ethiopian Jews. Incidentally, the first scholar to describe using a modern, scientific approach this ethnic group had been Filosseno Luzzatto, an Italki Jew. Starting in 1843, he collected and selected data about the Falasha.

On 28 July 1938, Pope Pius XI made a speech at Propaganda Fide college, expressing the view that mankind is &quot;a single, large, universal human race&quot; with &quot;no room for special races&quot;, and the Alliance Israélite Universelle thanked him for that speech.

In September of that year in a speech to Belgian pilgrims, Pius XI proclaimed:

Mark well that in the Catholic Mass, Abraham is our Patriarch and forefather. Anti-Semitism is incompatible with the lofty thought which that fact expresses. It is a movement with which we Christians can have nothing to do. No, no I say to you it is impossible for a Christian to take part in anti-Semitism. It is inadmissible. Through Christ and in Christ we are the spiritual progeny of Abraham. Spiritually we are all Semites.

While some Catholic prelates tried to find compromises with Fascism, several others spoke out against racism. The Archbishop of Milan, Cardinal Schuster, who had supported Amici Israel, condemned racism as &quot;heresy&quot; and an &quot;international danger ... not lesser than bolshevism&quot; in his 13 November 1938 homily at Milan Cathedral.

After Italy entered the war in 1940, Jewish refugees living in Italy were interned in Italian concentration camps such as the Campagna concentration camp and the concentration camp at Ferramonti di Tarsia. In 1942, the Italian military commander in Croatia refused to hand over Jews in his zone to the Nazis. In January 1943, the Italians refused to cooperate with the Nazis in rounding up the Jews living in the occupied zone of France under their control, and in March prevented the Nazis from deporting Jews in their zone. German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop complained to Benito Mussolini that &quot;Italian military circles... lack a proper understanding of the Jewish question.&quot;

The deportations of Italian Jews to Nazi death camps began after September 1943, when the Italian Royal government
capitulated to the Allies and, in response, the Germans forcibly disarmed the Italian armed forces. However, by the time they got to the Campagna internment camp, the inmates had already fled to the mountains with the help of the local inhabitants. Rev. Aldo Brunacci of Assisi, under the direction of his bishop, Giuseppe Nicolini, saved all the Jews who sought refuge in Assisi. This effort became the basis for the novel &quot;The Assisi Underground&quot;. In October 1943, Nazis raided the Jewish ghetto in Rome. In November 1943, the Jews of Genoa and Florence were deported to Auschwitz. Jews of Friuli were deported to Auschwitz via Risiera di San Sabba concentration camp. It is estimated that 7,682 Italian Jews became victims of the Holocaust.Celeste Di Porto terror of the Roman Jewish Ghetto reported the hiding places of twenty-six Jews, who were shot in the Fosse Ardeatine massacre of 1943 (postwar she served seven years of a 12 year sentence and died in 1981)
The attitude of the Italian Fascists (in their Italian Social Republic German puppet state in northern Italy) towards Italian Jews drastically changed in November 1943, after the Fascist authorities declared them to be of &quot;enemy nationality&quot; during the Congress of Verona and begun to actively participate in the prosecution and arrest of Jews. However, this prosecution by Italian authorities did not extend to people descended from mixed marriages. Initially, after the Italian surrender, the Italian police had only assisted in the round up of Jews when requested to do so by the German authorities. But after the &quot;&quot;, in which Jews were declared to be foreigners and, in times of war, enemies, this changed. Police Order No. 5 on 30 November 1943, issued by the Minister of the Interior of the RSI Guido Buffarini Guidi, ordered the Italian police to arrest Jews and confiscate their property.

After September 1943, when the Italian northern half effectively came under German occupation, SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Karl Wolff, was appointed as the Supreme SS and Police Leader in Italy tasked with overseeing the final solution, the genocide of the Jews. Wolff assembled a group of SS personnel under him that had a vast experience in the extermination of Jews in Eastern Europe. Odilo Globocnik, appointed as Higher SS and Police Leader for the Adriatic coastal area, was responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews and Gypsies in Lublin, Poland, before being sent to Italy. Karl Brunner was appointed as SS and Police Leader in Bolzano, South Tyrol, Willy Tensfeld in Monza for upper and western Italy and Karl-Heinz Bürger was placed in charge of anti-partisan operations.

The security police and the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) came under the command of Wilhelm Harster, based in Verona, who had previously held the same position in the Netherlands. Theodor Dannecker, previously active in the deportation of Greek Jews in the part of Greece occupied by Bulgaria, was made chief of the &quot;Judenreferat&quot; of the SD and was tasked with the deportation of the Italian Jews. Not seen as efficient enough, he was replaced by Friedrich Boßhammer, who was, like Dannecker, closely associated with Adolf Eichmann. Dannecker committed suicide after being captured in December 1945 while Boßhammer assumed a false name after the war. He was discovered and sentenced to life in jail in West Germany in 1972 but died before ever serving any time.

General Kurt Mälzer, the German commander in Rome, died in 1952. The Austrian Ludwig Koch was the head of the Gestapo and the Fascist Italian police in Rome and received three years imprisonment after the war.

===Jews after the war===

It is estimated that about 10,000 Italian Jews were deported to concentration and death camps, of whom 7,700 perished in the Holocaust, out of a pre-war Jewish population that amounted to 58,500 (46,500 by Jewish religion and 12,000 converted or non-Jewish sons of mixed marriages). The surviving community was able to maintain its distinctiveness throughout the following decades and continued to have a significant role in the fields of politics, literature, science and industry. Writers such as Giorgio Bassani, Natalia Ginzburg and Primo Levi were among the leading figures of the Italian culture in the post-war years.

A significant event that marked the Italian Jewish community was the conversion to Catholicism of the Chief Rabbi of Rome, Israel Zolli, in 1945.

The size of the Italian Jewish community has faced a slight but continuous drop throughout the postwar decades, partly because of emigration to Israel or the United States and partly because of low birth rates, assimilation and intermarriage, especially in the small congregations of the North. A significant increase occurred during the 1970s due to the arrival of Iranian Jews (following the ousting of the Shah) and North African Jews (mainly coming from Libya in the aftermath of Gaddafi&#x27;s seizure of power).

==21st century==
In 2007 the Jewish population in Italy numbered around 45–46,000 people, decreased to 42,850 in 2015 (36,150 with Italian citizenship) and to 41,200 in 2017 (36,600 with Italian citizenship and 25–28,000 affiliated with the Union of Italian Jewish Communities), mainly because of low birth rates and emigration due to the financial crisis. There have been occasional antisemitic incidents in the last decades. On 13 December 2017 the Museum of Italian Judaism and the Shoah (MEIS) was inaugurated in Ferrara. The museum traces the history of the Jewish people in Italy starting from the Roman empire, and going through the Holocaust during the 20th century.

==Demographics==

In 2007, there were approximately 45,000 Jews in Italy, of a total Italian population of 60 million people (i.e., 0.05-0.1% of the total), not counting recent migrations from Eastern Europe. The greatest concentrations were in Rome (20,000 people) and Milan (12,000 people).

<text>Matthew Thomas Brimson (born 1 December 1970) is a former English cricketer. Brimson, a slow left arm orthodox bowler, played first-class cricket for Leicestershire. 

Born in Plumstead, Brimson was educated at Chislehurst and Sidcup Grammar School. He played briefly for the Kent Second Eleven (1990–1991) and studied at Durham University, where he represented the university side. He made 66 first-class and 45 List A appearances for Leicestershire, with best bowling figures of 5 wickets from 12 balls. 

He was accused of indecent exposure for a prank in a team photograph that appeared in the 2000 edition of &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;. The photo escaped the attention of editors, and Brimson avoided any punishment as he had already retired from cricket and gone into teaching by the time the incident came to light.

<doc id="1263624" wikidata="Q4118034" url="?curid=1263624" title="Interaction point">
<text>In particle physics, an interaction point (IP) is the place where particles collide in an accelerator experiment. The &quot;nominal&quot; interaction point is the design position, which may differ from the &quot;real&quot; or &quot;physics&quot; interaction point, where the particles actually collide. A related, but distinct, concept is the &quot;primary vertex&quot;: the reconstructed location of an individual particle collision.

For fixed target experiments, the interaction point is the point where beam and target interact. For colliders, it is the place where the beams interact.
Experiments (detectors) at particle accelerators are built around the nominal interaction points of the accelerators. The whole region around the interaction point (the experimental hall) is called an interaction region.
Particle colliders such as LEP, HERA, RHIC, Tevatron and LHC can host several interaction regions and therefore several experiments taking advantage of the same beam.

<text>Yaqui (or Hiaki), locally known as Yoeme or Yoem Noki, is a Native American language of the Uto-Aztecan family. It is spoken by about 20,000 Yaqui people in the Mexican state of Sonora and across the border in Arizona in the United States. It is partially intelligible with the Mayo language, also spoken in Sonora, and together they are called Cahitan languages.

==Phonology==

The remarks below use the orthography used by the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in the United States. There are also several orthographic systems used in Mexico differing slightly, mainly in using Spanish values for several consonants and Spanish spelling rules: &quot;rohikte&quot; would be written &quot;rojicte&quot;. There are minor differences in the sounds of Mexican and American dialects, the latter tending to exclude an intervocalic &quot;r&quot; and final &quot;k&quot;.

===Vowels===
Yaqui vowel sounds are similar to those of Spanish:

Vowels may be either short or long in duration. Often, long vowels are shortened when the word they are used in is used constructively: &#x27;maaso&#x27; (&#x27;deer&#x27;) is shortened to &#x27;maso&#x27; in &#x27;maso bwikam&#x27; (&#x27;deer songs&#x27;). Long vowels are written by doubling the vowel. Long vowels may change tone, but that is not represented in the written language. Yaqui has often been described as being a tonal or &quot;pitch accent&quot; language, but the modern forms of the language do not show any widespread and significant use of tonemes.

===Consonants===
The following consonantal sounds are present in Yaqui: b, ch, (d), (f), (g), h, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, y, and one or two glottal stops (IPA ), represented by an apostrophe. Except for the glottal stops, most of them are pronounced nearly the same as they are in English, but &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;k&quot; are not aspirated. In the IPA, they are respectively .

Many Yaqui speakers pronounce b and v exactly the same, as . That appears to be intrinsic to Yaqui, rather than from the influence of Spanish, which has a similar feature. Additionally, there are two consonants written as clusters: &quot;bw&quot; (IPA ) and &quot;kt&quot; (IPA ), &quot;bw&quot; being a rounded &quot;b&quot; (&#x27;bwikam&#x27;) and &quot;kt&quot; a simultaneous articulation of &quot;k&quot; and &quot;t&quot; (&#x27;rohikte&#x27;). The &quot;kt&quot; sound is found in many other Uto-Aztecan languages. Pronunciation of the rounded &quot;b&quot; as &quot;b&quot;+&quot;w&quot; and the &quot;kt&quot; as &quot;k&quot;+&quot;t&quot; is acceptable but non-native.

Also, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, and &quot;g&quot; are present only in English and Spanish loanwords and are substituted with the native sounds &quot;t&quot;/&quot;r&quot;/&quot;l&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;w&quot;/&quot;k&quot;, respectively.

In Mexico, many speakers substitute &quot;g&quot; for syllable-initial &quot;w&quot;. That is largely because Spanish lacks a /w/ phoneme. The phone [w] is present in Spanish not as an independent consonantal phoneme but as a variant of the vowel /u/ and the consonant /g/ when it is before a /u/ or /o/. The use of &quot;g&quot; in place of &quot;w&quot; is considered by Yaqui speakers as an influence from Spanish and not standard Yaqui usage, even in Mexico.

====Glottal stops====
There is at least one glottal stop, which is phonemic. There also appears to be a &quot;fainter&quot; glottal stop that is sometimes used between vowels but with apparently little predictability. Whether it is phonemic or not is still unclear.

===Sound symbolism===
Sound symbolism is present in Yaqui. For example, a word with the phoneme /l/ in it may be pronounced normally, to denote approval from the speaker, or with /r/ replacing the /l/, to denote disapproval or disfavor on the part of the speaker. Either form is correct.

===Devoicing===
Devoicing occurs at the ends of phrases. That is especially notable with the phoneme /m/ and with vowels. Yaqui speech often sounds &quot;breathy&quot; to English speakers.

===Gestures===
One word, &quot;laute&quot;, has two contradictory meanings in translation into English: &quot;quickly&quot; and &quot;slowly&quot;. (Incidentally, English has similar words of contrasting meanings: &quot;mercurial&quot;, which can mean either &quot;unhesitating&quot; or &quot;scatter-brained&quot;, and &quot;quite&quot; which can mean &quot;very&quot; or &quot;a little&quot;.)

&quot;Laute&quot; is often accompanied with a quick or slow open-handed movement to indicate the meaning, or it could be translated as &quot;at a different speed&quot; and requires a hand gesture to indicate the nature of the difference when that is needed for clarification.)

==Grammar==

===Syntax===
Yaqui word order is generally subject–object–verb.

The object of a sentence is suffixed with &quot;-ta&quot;.

===Word order structures===
====Subject object====
The following sentences display a variation of the language&#x27;s structure and the forms allowed. In the following example, we can see an S and an O. This structure of SO is allowable due to a common feature among languages— the verb/ copula to be. &#x27;He&#x27; is the subject in this example and since &#x27;he&#x27; shows no variation in positioning in the sentence, there will not be further explanation for it. The object in this example &#x27;child&#x27; has the possessor &#x27;him&#x27; preceding to show ownership, but what is being possessed by &#x27;him&#x27; is the child. Therefore, &#x27;child&#x27; has a nominalizer for being the object of the sentence and a possession marker on it for being possessed. Having the nominalizer on the &#x27;child&#x27; allows the subject &#x27;he&#x27; to imply a state of being on the &#x27;child&#x27;. This structure SO uses the &quot;to be&quot; verb/ copula, when information is being stated that x is y.

====Subject verb object====
In the following example, we can see an example of where the primary word order SOV, deviates to become SVO. Note the pronoun &#x27;I&#x27; doesn&#x27;t have any case marking active and is in pronoun form (see Cases on Pronouns). Next, on the first or main verb &#x27;able&#x27;, there isn&#x27;t any specification for the type of verb. When the main verb is followed by another verb, it seems the second verb becomes intransitivized. On the object of the sentence &#x27;axe&#x27;, there are multiple cases active: accusative case (the direct object of the verb), a plural suffix, and an instrumental case (the means by how or with what something gets done) on the noun.

====Object subject verb====
The following is an additional example that shows variant in word order than previously seen— OSV. In this structure, a suffix called connective is used to show that two constituents are being connected; simply, they function as a conjunction. Although this is a simple function, it is worth mentioning in understanding the way Yaqui functions as a system. The subject comes after the object in the correct subject pronoun form. Following is the verb &#x27;remember&#x27;, which may be a trigger to the word order. Perhaps this word order implies the topic should be &quot;who/what&quot; is being remembered.

===Case===
Yaqui is a &quot;noun-heavy&quot; agglutinative language.

For example, the first person singular pronoun &quot;in&quot; or &quot;ne&quot; (which varies by dialect), is more often used in the form &quot;inepo&quot;, which can be translated &quot;within me&quot;. The &quot;-(e)po&quot; ending is quite common and seems to denote much more than simple physical inclusion.

Cases are marked on the nouns with suffixes. The following is a list of all the cases that are marked in the language.
===Nouns===
Plural nouns are formed by adding the suffix &quot;-im&quot;, or &quot;-m&quot; if the noun ends in a vowel. If the noun ends in a &quot;t&quot;, it changes to &quot;ch&quot; when &quot;-im&quot; is added.

:* &quot;Tekil&quot; - Job
:* &quot;Tekilim&quot; - Jobs

If a plural noun is the object of a sentence, the suffixation of &quot;-t&quot; or &quot;-ta&quot; is not used.

===Verbs===
Usually, adding the suffix &quot;-k&quot; to a verb indicates past tense, though there are many exceptions. If a verb ends in a diphthong, &quot;-kan&quot; is added. If a verb ends in &quot;-i&quot;, &quot;-akan&quot; is added. If a verb ends in &quot;-o&quot; or &quot;-u&quot;, &quot;-ekan&quot; is added, and if a verb ends in &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-ikan&quot; is added. If a verb ends in &quot;-k&quot;, &quot;-an&quot; is added.

Regularly, &quot;-ne&quot; indicates the future.

====Tense and aspect====
Yaqui possess a &quot;prior state&quot; or &#x27;used to be, now deceased&#x27; suffix. It is -tu-káꞋu. This specific suffix attaches to a nominal noun to indicate a prior existence, but can also attach as a verb to reflect the state of a human noun (not only animate). For example, (suffixed as a verb) to the right.

The following is a table on the various tense markers that act more as aspectual values and epistemic states.
===Adjectives===
In Yaqui, adjectives very often act as verbs (in Afro-Asiatic linguistics, they would be called &quot;stative verbs&quot;). For instance, &quot;vemela&quot; or &quot;new&quot;, would most often be used to mean &quot;is new&quot;. Adjectives have tenses, the same as verbs.

===Reduplication===

Reduplication is present in Yaqui. 
Reduplicating the first syllable of a verb indicates habitual action:

:* &quot;eta&quot; - shuts
:* &quot;e&#x27;eta&quot; - usually shuts

Primary reduplication is also used to pluralize adjectives.

Reduplicating the second consonant of a verb is used to show that an action is performed rarely.

==Sample words and phrases==
:* &quot;o&#x27;ow&quot; - man
:* &quot;hamut&quot; - woman
:* &quot;tu&#x27;i hiapsek&quot; - kind (lit. &quot;good hearted&quot;)
:* &quot;yantela -&quot; peace
:* &quot;halla&#x27;i&quot; - friend
:* &quot;maaso&quot; - deer
:* &quot;aamu&quot; - to hunt
:* &quot;totoi&quot; (plural. &quot;totoim) -&quot; chicken

:* &quot;aman ne tevote em yevihnewi&quot; - &quot;I extend my greetings&quot;

Greetings often are very formal. The following formula of four phrases is often used even among close friends:
:* &quot;Lios em chania&quot; - &quot;Greetings!&quot; (to one person, to more than one: &quot;Lios em chaniavu&quot;) (lit. &quot;God preserves you!&quot;, &quot;Lios&quot; [sometimes pronounced &quot;Lioh&quot;] is a very early borrowing of the Spanish &quot;Dios&quot;)
:* &quot;Lios em chiokoe&quot; - (the reply to the above, lit. &quot;God pardons you!&quot;)
:* &quot;Empo allea&quot; - &quot;May you rejoice!&quot; (lit. &quot;In you happy&quot;, &#x27;allea&#x27; is said to be from the Spanish &#x27;alegre&#x27;, meaning &#x27;happy&#x27;)
:* &quot;Kettu&#x27;i&quot; - &quot;How kind!&quot;

===Kinship terminology===


== Language revitalization and teaching ==
In 2009, the Pascua Yaqui Tribal Council and the University of Arizona collaborated on a program in which tribal elders teach the Yaqui language to families. As of 2010, a revitalization project was underway at the university, &quot;using 30 year old audio tapes recorded by tribal member Maria Leyva.&quot; As of 2012, &quot;Any teaching materials, tools, lessons, audio lessons, etc.,&quot; on the website of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe were &quot;restricted to &#x27;Tribally enrolled Members&#x27; only.&quot;

<doc id="1263640" wikidata="Q7152593" url="?curid=1263640" title="Paul Moravec">
<text>Paul Moravec (born November 2, 1957) is an American composer and a university professor at Adelphi University on Long Island, New York and also a member of the composition department of the Mannes School of Music . Already a prolific composer, he has been described as a &quot;new tonalist.&quot; He is best known for his work &quot;Tempest Fantasy&quot;, which received the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Music. Among his compositions are two operas: &quot;The Letter&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Shining&quot; (2016).

==Biography==
Moravec was born in Buffalo, New York, and subsequently attended the Lawrenceville School, graduating in 1975. He received his B.A. in composition from Harvard University in 1980; while there, he performed with the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, one of the Holden Choirs. He won the Prix de Rome and studied at the American Academy in Rome after graduating. He then received the Master of Music (1982) and Doctor of Musical Arts (1987) in composition, both from Columbia University.

Moravec has taught at Dartmouth College (1987–96) and Hunter College (1997–98). He suffered from clinically diagnosed depression that worsened during the time immediately surrounding his departure from Dartmouth College, and underwent electroshock therapy. He is currently a university professor in the music department at Adelphi University, He also teaches composition at the Mannes School of Music, contributing to what &quot;The New York Times&quot; has called a &quot;renaissance&quot; in a college that went through academic and financial difficulties in the 1990s.

In 2004, Moravec received the Pulitzer Prize for Music for his work &quot;Tempest Fantasy&quot;. This prestigious award raised Moravec&#x27;s profile significantly, and he was appointed to several residencies. He was named the new honorary composer-member of the New York Composers Circle in September, 2006. He was also appointed the composer in residence for the 2007-2008 academic year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

In addition to his Pulitzer Prize, Moravec has received a Composer Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship, and the Charles Ives Prize and Goddard Lieberson Awards in American Composition. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2010.

He has been commissioned by such ensembles as the Dessoff Choirs, the Albany Symphony Orchestra, and the Harvard Glee Club.

==Musical style==
Moravec has been placed into a group called &quot;new tonalists&quot; by the critic Terry Teachout, who describes them as composers who are &quot;neither embarrassed nor paralyzed by tradition. Rather they accept it as a given.&quot; Thus, according to this analysis, his style is primarily tonal and neo-romantic. However, Moravec himself asserts: The term ‘new tonalist’ is a little outdated simply because of the passage of time[.] It had more relevance a few decades ago, when late modernism was dying or even dead. For my work, I regard the term only as a point of departure before considering each composition on a case-by-case basis. As a composer, I try always to make beautiful things, and I use whatever techniques and materials are useful for the particular composition at hand[.] Some of those materials are atonal or nontonal, but the overall harmonic context of my music derives from the tonal tradition, which after all is the lingua franca of Western music — essentially, Monteverdi to the Beatles and beyond.

Critic Jens F. Laurson described Moravec&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Tempest Fantasy&quot; as &quot;remarkably accessible music. Picturesque, conventionally beautiful at times, but without pandering to the ears’ lowest harmonic expectations. [It is] music that works with all the traditional tools from the composer’s workshop[,] which have changed surprisingly little since Bach - but Moravec uses them to create music anew.&quot; He named Federico Mompou, Claude Debussy, Paul Hindemith, Francis Poulenc, and Elliott Carter as clear musical influences in Moravec&#x27;s music. He also noted a clear disparity between Moravec&#x27;s music and that of minimalist composers Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and John Adams.

Critic Victor Carr Jr. characterizes Moravec&#x27;s musical language as &quot;generally tonal--and although it&#x27;s not consistently melodic, it&#x27;s always accessible. More than that, it&#x27;s highly engrossing[.]&quot;

==Musical works==
His best-known pieces include the Pulitzer-winning, Shakespeare-inspired &quot;Tempest Fantasy&quot;, a 30-minute chamber work scored for clarinet, violin, cello, and piano, which was premiered on May 2, 2003, at the Morgan Library in New York City by David Krakauer and Trio Solisti, for whom it was written; &quot;Northern Lights Electric&quot;, a 1994 work that combines a musical illustration of the Northern Lights with a musical depiction of electric light; and the 1998 cantata &quot;Fire/Ice/Air&quot;, which contrasts the journeys of Captain Robert Falcon Scott, on his expedition to the Antarctic, and Charles Lindbergh, on his trans-Atlantic flight. An oratorio, &quot;Blizzard Voices&quot;, about the Schoolhouse Blizzard of 1888, was commissioned by Opera Omaha and was premiered there in September 2008. He collaborated with Terry Teachout on &quot;The Letter&quot;, an opera based on the 1927 play by W. Somerset Maugham that was premiered in 2009 by the Santa Fe Opera.

<text>Patrol torpedo boat &quot;PT-34 was a of the [[United States Navy]], built by the [[Electric Launch Company]] of [[Bayonne, New Jersey]]. The boat was laid down asMotor boat submarine chaser &quot;PTC-14, but was reclassified as &quot;PT-34&quot; prior to its launch on 14 June 1941, and was commissioned on 12 July 1941.

==Service history==
&quot;PT-34&quot; was placed in service with Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Two` (PTRon 2), and was transferred to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three (PTRon 3) on 12 August 1941. Under the command Lt(jg). Robert B. Kelly (also the executive officer of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three), &quot;PT-34&quot; was based in the Philippines.

On 17 December 1941, , a passenger ship loaded with 1,200 passengers, struck a mine off Corregidor and sank with a large loss of life. &quot;PT-34&quot;, along with squadron mates and rescued some 280 survivors, who were distributed between Corregidor and French ship SS &quot;Si-Kiang&quot;.

On the night of 22 January 1942 during the Battle of the Points, Japanese troops of the 20th Infantry attempted a landing on the west coast of southern Bataan. Intercepted by &quot;PT-34&quot;, two barges were sunk, disrupting the landings. 

On 12 March 1942 the boat evacuated Admiral Francis W. Rockwell, General Richard Marshall (Deputy Chief of Staff, ), Col. Charles P. Stivers (G-1 [Personnel], ), Capt. Joseph McMicking (Philippine Army, Asst. G-2 [Intelligence], ) from Corregidor to Mindanao as part of the operation to evacuate General Douglas MacArthur to Australia. 
On the night of 8 April 1942, off Cebu, the and the torpedo boat &quot;Kiji&quot; were attacked by &quot;PT-34&quot; in concert with . Both PT boats reported seeing multiple torpedo hits on the &quot;Kuma&quot; from their attack, but according to Japanese Navy records examined after the war, the &quot;Kuma&quot; was hit in the bow by one of the torpedoes fired by &quot;PT-34&quot;, but it failed to detonate.

&quot;PT-34&quot; was attacked near Kauit Island by four Japanese F1M &quot;Pete&quot; floatplanes from the &quot;Sanuki Maru&quot; on 9 April 1942, in the aftermath of the &quot;Kuma&quot; attack. With three feet of water in the engine room, Lt. Kelly beached the boat, and abandoned it. &quot;PT-34&quot; was later strafed by Japanese aircraft, set on fire and destroyed. The crew suffered one KiA, one DoW, and three WiA. Kelly was later transported out of the Philippines along with three other officers of the squadron. The executive officer Iliff David Richardson remained in the Philippines with the guerrilla forces, and later an account of his experiences were published in a book (later made into a film) &quot;American Guerrilla in the Philippines&quot;.

<doc id="1263663" wikidata="Q2302610" url="?curid=1263663" title="Ideophone">
<text>An ideophone, also known as a mimetic word or expressive, is any word in a certain word class evoking ideas in sound imitation (onomatopoeia) to express an action, manner, or property. The class of ideophones is the least common syntactic category cross-linguistically; it occurs mostly in African, Australian, and Amerindian languages, and sporadically elsewhere. It is globally the only known word class that does not appear in English. Ideophones resemble interjections but are unclassifiable as such owing to their special phonetic or derivational characteristics, and based on their syntactic function within the sentence. They may include sounds that deviate from the language&#x27;s phonological system, imitating—often in a repetitive manner—sounds of movement, animal noises, bodily sounds, noises made by tools or machines, and the like.

While English does have ideophonic or onomatopoetic expressions, it does not contain a proper class of ideophones because any English onomatopoeic word can be included in one of the classical categories. For example, &quot;la-di-da&quot; functions as an adjective while others, such as &quot;zigzag&quot;, may function as a verb, adverb or adjective, depending on the clausal context. In the sentence &#x27;The rabbit zigzagged across the meadow&quot;, the verb zigzag takes the past –&quot;ed&quot; verb ending. In contrast, the reconstructed example *&quot;The rabbit &quot;zigzag zigzag&quot; across the meadow&quot; emulates an ideophone but is not idiomatic to English.

Dictionaries of languages like Japanese, Korean, Xhosa, Yoruba, and Zulu list thousands of ideophones. Sometimes ideophones are called &quot;phonosemantic&quot; to indicate that it is not a grammatical word class in the traditional sense of the word (like verb or noun), but rather a lexical class based on the special relationship between form and meaning exhibited by ideophones. In the discipline of linguistics, ideophones have sometimes been overlooked or treated as a subgroup of interjections.

==Characteristics==

The word ideophone was coined in 1935 by Clement Martyn Doke, who defined it in his &quot;Bantu Linguistic Terminology&quot; as follows.
Ideophones evoke sensory events. A well known instance of ideophones are onomatopoeic words—words that imitate the sound (of the event) they refer to. Some ideophones may be derived from onomatopoeic notions. In many languages, however, ideophones do not solely represent sound. For instance, in Gbaya, &quot;kpuk &quot;&#x27;a rap on the door&#x27; may be onomatopoeic, but other ideophones depict motion and visual scenes: &quot;loɓoto-loɓoto&quot; &#x27;large animals plodding through mud&#x27;, &quot;kiláŋ-kiláŋ&quot; &#x27;in a zigzagging motion&#x27;, &quot;pɛɗɛŋ-pɛɗɛŋ&quot; &#x27;razor sharp&#x27;.

Ideophones are often characterized as iconic or sound-symbolic words, meaning that there can be a resemblance between their form and their meaning. For instance, in West-African languages, voiced consonants and low tone in ideophones are often connected to largeness and heaviness, whereas voiceless consonants and high tones tend to relate to smallness and lightness. Reduplication figures quite prominently in ideophones, often conveying a sense of repetition or plurality present in the evoked event. The iconicity of ideophones is shown by the fact that people can guess the meanings of ideophones from various languages at a level above chance. However, the form of ideophones does not completely relate to their meaning; as conventionalized words, they contain arbitrary, language-specific phonemes just like other parts of the vocabulary.

===Grammar===
The grammatical function of ideophones varies by language. In some languages (e.g. Welayta, Yir-Yiront, Semai, Korean), they form a separate word class, while in others, they occur across a number of different word classes (e.g. Mundang, Ewe, Sotho, Hausa).

Despite this diversity, ideophones show a number of robust regularities across languages. One is that they are often marked in the same way as quoted speech and demonstrations. Sometimes ideophones can form a complete utterance on their own, as in English &quot;ta-da!&quot; or Japanese . However, in such cases the word ideophone is used as a synonym to interjection. Proper ideophones may occur within utterances, depicting a scene described by other elements of the utterance, as in Japanese &quot;Taro wa sutasuta to haya-aruki o shita&quot; &quot;Taro walked hurriedly&#x27; (literally &#x27;Taro did haste-walk &quot;sutasuta&quot;&#x27;). Ideophones are more like illustrations &quot;of&quot; events than responses &quot;to&quot; events. An ideophone like Gbaya &quot;kiláŋ-kiláŋ&quot; &#x27;in a zigzagging motion&#x27; displays a certain resemblance to the event (for instance, its irregular vowels and tones depicting the irregularity of the motion).

===Registers===
Languages may differ in the context in which ideophones are used. In some languages, ideophones are primarily used in spoken language (e.g. narrative contexts) and are rarely encountered in written language. In other languages (e.g. Ewe, Japanese), ideophones can be freely used in all registers. In general, however, ideophones tend to occur more extensively in spoken language because of their expressive or dramaturgic function.

==Examples==

===Japanese===

The Japanese language has thousands of ideophones, often called &quot;mimetics&quot;. The constructions are quite metrical 2-2, or 3-3, where morae play a role in the symmetry. The first consonant of the second word of the reduplication may become voiced if phonological conditions allow. Japanese ideophones are used extensively in daily conversations as well as in the written language.
* &quot;doki doki&quot; () – heart-pounding
* &quot;kira kira&quot; () – glittery
* &quot;shiin&quot; () – silence
* &quot;niko niko&quot; () – smile
* &quot;jii&quot; () – stare
* &quot;run run&quot; () – cheerful

===Tamil===
The Tamil language uses many ideophones, both in spoken (colloquial) and in formal usage. Ideophones are called irattaik kilavi (இரட்டைக் கிளவி) in Tamil grammar.
* &quot;sora sora&quot; () – rough (the sound produced when rubbing back and forth on a rough surface)
* &quot;vazha-vazha&quot; () – smooth, slippery
* &quot;mozhu-mozhu&quot; () – smooth (surface)
* &quot;kozhu-kozhu&quot; () – plump
* &quot;kozha-kozha&quot; () – slimy, gooey
* &quot;busu-busu&quot; () – soft and bushy
* &quot;kaNa-kaNa&quot; () - warm, hot
* &quot;giDu-giDu&quot; () – quickly, fast
* &quot;Tak-Tak&quot; () - quickly, rapidly
* &quot;maDa-maDa&quot; () – quickly, fast
* &quot;masa-masa&quot; () – sluggish, lethargic
* &quot;viru-viru&quot; () – energetically (also, spicy)
* &quot;choda-choda&quot; () – marshy, waterlogged
* &quot;paLa-paLa&quot; () – glittering, shiny
* &quot;veDa-veDa&quot; () – shaking, trembling
* &quot;chuDa-chuDa&quot; () – piping hot
* &quot;mAngu-mAngu&quot; () – laboriously
* &quot;gara-gara&quot; () – crunchy (as in food), gravely (as in voice)
* &quot;gaba-gaba&quot; () - wolfing down food
* &quot;doLa-doLa&quot; () - hanging loose (as in loose fitting)
* &quot;taLa-taLa&quot; () - lush (as in a lush plant/orchard)
* &quot;toNa-toNa&quot; () - annoyingly incessant

===Xhosa===

In Xhosa, as in closely related Zulu, ideophones can convey very complex experiential impressions or can just strengthen meanings of other words. The ideophone is often introduced using the verb .

Using :
* – to be silent
:: . &#x27;It is time to be silent.&#x27; [literally: &#x27;It is time to say .&#x27;]
* – to suddenly appear
:: . &#x27;The white people suddenly arrived in Africa.&#x27; [Literally: &#x27;The white people said in Africa.&#x27;])

Without using :
* – exact

* &quot;bhuxe&quot; – to stand motionless

<text>Skunk City is a Syracuse, New York neighborhood that for a number of years has been known by this name, and before 1886 was a rural part of the Town of Geddes. The area was first inhabited by Irish immigrants but later grew to include a variety of ethnic communities. The neighborhood boundaries are Geddes St. on the east, Grand Ave. and Burnet Park on the north, and West Onondaga St. on the south. Harbor Brook Retention area is to the west. The root of neighborhood&#x27;s name is not explicitly stated. While some attribute it to the unusually high number of skunks that roam the area at night, others cite the smell given off by the local creek.

<doc id="1263688" wikidata="Q154853" url="?curid=1263688" title="Diauehi">
<text>Diauehi (Modern , Urartian &quot;Diauehi&quot;, Greek &quot;Taochoi&quot;, Armenian &quot;Tayk&quot;, possibly Assyrian &quot;Daiaeni&quot;) was a tribal union located in northeastern Anatolia, that was recorded in Assyrian and Urartian sources during the Iron Age. It is usually (though not always) identified with the earlier Daiaeni (Dayaeni), attested in the Yonjalu inscription of the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser I&#x27;s third year (1118 BC) and in later records by Shalmaneser III (845 BC). While it is unknown what language(s) they spoke, they may have been speakers of a Kartvelian, Armenian, Iranian, or Hurrian language.

==Location==

Although the exact geographic extent of Diauehi is still unclear, many scholars place it in the Pasinler Plain in today&#x27;s northeastern Turkey, while others locate it in the Armenian–Georgian marchlands as it follows the Kura River. Most probably, the core of the Diauehi lands may have extended from the headwaters of the Euphrates into the river valleys of Çoruh to Oltu. The Urartian sources speak of Diauehi&#x27;s three key cities—Zua, Utu and Sasilu; Zua is frequently identified with Zivin Kale and Utu is probably modern Oltu, while Sasilu is sometimes linked to the early medieval Georgian toponym Sasire, near Tortomi (present-day Tortum, Turkey). 
The Diaeuhian city Šešetina may have corresponded to Şavşat, Turkey (Shavsheti in Georgian).

The region of Diauehi seems to have roughly corresponded to, or bordered, the previous Hayasa-Azzi territory.

==History==
In the early 8th century, Diauehi became the target of the newly emerged regional power of Urartu. Menua (810–785 BC) conquered part of Diaeuhi, annexing its most important cities: Zua, Utu, and Shashilu, and forcing the king of Diauehi, Utupursi(ni), to pay a tribute of gold and silver.

Menua&#x27;s son Argishti I (785–763 BC), campaigned against the Diauehi kingdom in 783. Argishti I defeated King Utupursi, annexing his possessions․ In exchange for his life, Utupursi was forced to pay a tribute including a variety of metals and livestock. Toward the end of his reign, Argishti I led yet another campaign against Utuspursi, who led a rebellion against the Urartians.

==Possible ethno-linguistic identification==

Diauehi is considered by some as a locus of Proto-Kartvelian; it has been described as an &quot;important tribal formation of possible proto-Georgians&quot; by Ronald Grigor Suny (1994).

According to Robert H. Hewsen, they may have been speakers of a language unrelated to any other in the Caucasus region.

However, they are mentioned by Diodorus Siculus as Xaoi, which Hewsen etymologizes as a Greek form of the Armenian endonym, Hayk&#x27;.

Massimo Forlanini proposed a connection between the name of the Diaeuhi tribe, Baltu, and the Hayasan deity, Baltaik. He also compared these to the name of the Hayasan mercenary, Waltahi.

==Connection to Daiaeni (Dayaeni)==

Some scholars have linked the Diaeuhi to the Bronze Age Daiaeni (Dayaeni) tribe, mentioned in 12th century BC Assyrian sources as being part of the Nairi confederation. This connection is mainly due to the phonetic similarities of the names Daiaeni and Diaeuhi.

The Daiaeni were powerful enough to counter the Assyrian forays, although in 1112 BC their king, Sien, was defeated by Tiglath-Pileser I. Sien was captured and later released on terms of vassalage.

Daiaeni appeared again in Assyrian texts nearly three centuries later when King Asia of Daiaeni (850–825 BC) was forced to submit to the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III in 845 BC, after the latter had overrun Urartu and made a foray into Daiaeni.

As the Daiaeni of Assyrian records seem to have been located further south than the Diaeuhi of Urartian records, Robert H. Hewsen and Nicholas Adontz proposed that the Diaieni originally inhabited a region between Palu and either Mush Province or Lake Van. They then moved north to Kars Province, where they battled the Urartians and later encountered Greek mercenaries, including Xenophon. They subsequently moved further northwest.

Archibald Sayce suggested that Daiaeni was named after an eponymous founder, Diaus, and thus meant &quot;people of the land/tribe of Diau(s)&quot;.

<doc id="1263697" wikidata="Q232287" url="?curid=1263697" title="Bipod">
<text>A bipod is a V-shaped portable attachment that helps support and steady a device, usually a weapon such as a long gun or a mortar. The term comes from the Latin prefix and Greek root , meaning &quot;two&quot; and &quot;foot&quot; respectively.

Bipods are designed to support the weight of the weapon&#x27;s front portion and barrel, and provide significant stability against unwanted side-to-side movements (i.e. canting) while allowing free movements ing around the transverse axis (pitching). Most modern bipods have foldable and/or telescoping legs, and allow some limited movements around the vertical axis (panning) and even the longitudinal axis (tilting).

A bipod by itself, with only two supporting legs, is not completely stable and needs to be reinforced by at least one more point of support to be steady, especially against the horizontal shearing force from recoils. This third point of support is typically the buttstock that is firmly pushed/braced against the shooter&#x27;s body, but can also be a baseplate (in mortars), sometimes with additional support from a monopod or a bean bag.

== Firearms ==


Bipods are commonly used on rifles and machine guns to provide a forward rest and reduce unwanted motion. They are also seen on other long-barreled weapons. Bipods permit operators to easily rest a weapon on objects, such the ground or a wall, reducing fatigue and increasing accuracy and stability. Bipods can be of fixed or adjustable length. Some can be tilted and also have their tilting point close to the barrel&#x27;s central axis, allowing the weapon to tilt left and right. Some designs also allow the weapon to be rotated side-to-side. There are three ways for bipods to be folded: away from the shooter, towards the shooter, or into a vertical foregrip.

=== History ===
The first known use of bipods on firearms can be traced back to hand cannons of the 12th century, which were cast iron barrels laid on top of short poles.

Bipods on rifles are first known to have been used in an improvised fashion during the mid-19th century, particularly by frontiersmen hunting American bison and other wild animals. For example, the painting &quot;The Long Shot&quot; by Howard Terpning shows native American hunters shooting a rifle with an improvised bipod consisting of two crossed arrows.

During the 20th century, use of dedicated bipods increased, and was seen on different types of rifles during wars. For example the Lewis gun (1914) was fitted with an adjustable bipod. The technology became more advanced, with hinged legs and even extendable or retractable legs. The Brixia M1923 machine gun used a bipod that could also be used as a harness allowing the user to move around firing the weapon handling only the spade grips.

One of the first companies to manufacture commercially successful bipods was Harris Engineering, Inc founded in 1979 in Barlow, Kentucky by Gerald Harris, Margaret Harris, and Susan Wilkerson. Before starting the company, Gerald had applied for a patent on the bipod. In 2019, their successful Harris Bipods have been produced for nearly forty years, and have remained relatively unchanged.

Recent advances in manufacture of bipods include use of lightweight materials such as aluminium, carbon fiber and titanium, use of different quick attachment and detachment mechanisms (Picatinny, M-LOK, etc. or even magnets) and various types of feet materials such as rubber, metal, or a &quot;basket&quot; designed to stop the bipod from sinking into soft surfaces such as fine sand or deep snow (inspired by ski poles and snowshoes).

=== Mounting standards ===
There are several mounting standards for attaching a bipod to a rifle, of which some well known are swivel stud, Picatinny, M-LOK and Versa Pod spigot mount. Starting in the late 2010s, the Arca-Swiss style also gained popularity in shooting competitions such as the Precision Rifle Series since the rail allows for stepless adjustment.

<doc id="1263702" wikidata="Q7612652" url="?curid=1263702" title="Steve Gilchrist">
<text>Steve Gilchrist (born July 7, 1954) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003 and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Mike Harris.

==Background==
His father, Gordon Gilchrist, was a Progressive Conservative member of the House of Commons of Canada.

Gilchrist was educated at Queen&#x27;s University, receiving a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1975. Prior to entering elected office, he operated a number of Canadian Tire franchise stores from 1971 to 1995, including one of the largest stores in the chain. Gilchrist was involved in several other business ventures, including the construction of a shopping centre (The Town &amp; Country Centre) in Cobourg, Ontario, in 1989, and a family farming operation in Alnwick/Haldimand Township.

==Politics==
Active in the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party since 1970, Gilchrist first ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1990 provincial election in the riding of Scarborough East, but placed third behind incumbent Liberal Ed Fulton and the winner, New Democrat Bob Frankford. Later that year, he was elected third vice president of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party. Two years later, he was acclaimed as President of the party and served from 1992 to 1994, succeeding Tony Clement. From 1990 to 1994, Gilchrist hosted various cable television shows on Trillium Cable in Scarborough.

The Tories won a majority government in the 1995 election under Mike Harris. In a rematch from 1990, Gilchrist easily defeated Frankford by almost 12,000 votes, the highest plurality of any Toronto riding. He was immediately elected chair of the Standing Committee on Resources Development and he was named a parliamentary assistant to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing in 1997.

Gilchrist was re-elected in the 1999 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Peter Vanderyagt by about 3,500 votes. On June 17, 1999, Gilchrist was named Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing but stepped aside to defend himself from allegations by the development industry in October 1999 after he had announced his intention to ban all development on the Oak Ridges Moraine. The allegations were proved to be unfounded, and he was exonerated but was not returned to cabinet. Shortly thereafter, he was appointed as co-chair of the Red Tape Commission and as a Commissioner on the Board of Internal Economy, the all-party committee that oversees the operation of the Ontario Parliament building.

While serving as a cabinet minister, Gilchrist was responsible for co-ordinating the forced amalgamation of municipal governments in Ottawa, Hamilton and Sudbury. The political debate on the future of the Oak Ridges Moraine also began during his tenure. He remained active on the file after his resignation until the passage of the &quot;Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act&quot; in 2001.

Gilchrist was elected as Chair of the Standing Committee on General Government and, on April 25, 2002, he was appointed as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Energy and Environment.

On June 28, 2001, Gilchrist was put in charge of a Select Committee tasked with the goal of reviewing alternative, i.e. &quot;green&quot;, fuel sources. In the same year, he backed Jim Flaherty&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to succeed Mike Harris as party leader. In 2002, he was appointed as the first Commissioner of Alternative Energy for the province of Ontario, a position he held until December 2003.

During his time in office, Gilchrist introduced many private member&#x27;s bills which were passed into law, including &quot;Bill 20, the Good Samaritans Act of 2001&quot; This act guarantees protects anyone who competently attempts to give first aid or render other medical assistance is protected from any legal liability. In December 2001, Gilchrist&#x27;s youngest sister underwent a successful heart transplant and, in response to the significant waiting times faced by patients hoping for organ donation, on May 5, 2003, Gilchrist introduced &quot;Bill 17, the Organ or Tissue Donation Statute Law Amendment Act, 2003&quot;. The bill would have required anyone obtaining a provincial license or health card to complete an organ donation form and would have prevented any other person from overturning the decision of the donor, after death.

Other private member&#x27;s bill&#x27;s which were passed into law included &quot;Bill 172, the Toronto Hospital Act, 1997&quot;, which merged the Toronto Hospital and the Ontario Cancer Institute, at their request; &quot;Bill 110, the Professional Foresters Act, 2000&quot;; and the Act that created the Ontario Association of Former Parliamentarians, &quot;Bill 65, the Ontario Association of Former Parliamentarians Act, 2000&quot;. He also introduced Bills which would have raised the minimum smoking age in Ontario, formally designated the August Civic Holiday as &quot;Simcoe Day&#x27;, prevented the demolition of any buildings designated as &quot;heritage buildings&quot; and one which would have required the paying of Ontario income tax on the benefits received by federal Senators and Members of Parliament. His most notable bill was &quot;Bill 17, the Ontario Natural Heritage Act, 2002&quot;, which became the basis of the government bill, the &quot;Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2002&quot;, which put in place the long-term protection for the Oak Ridges Moraine.

He lost his seat in the 2003 provincial election, falling to Liberal Mary Anne Chambers by almost 7,000 votes.

In addition to his public activism within the PC Party and as a Member of Provincial Parliament, Gilchrist was very active in the community, serving as a governor of the Central Ontario YMCAs for 11 years; vice-chair of the Rouge Park Alliance; director of the Oak Ridges Moraine Foundation; director of the Oak Ridge Moraine Land Trust; director of the East Scarborough Boys &amp; Girls Club and a member of a number of local ratepayers associations in Scarborough. For over twenty years, Gilchrist annually funded &quot;Gilchrist Science Scholarships&quot; at the University of Toronto Scarborough and various local high schools.

===Cabinet positions===

==After politics==
After the election, Gilchrist became involved with a wide range of projects and companies involved in different forms of renewable energy generation. He became the Vice-President of Canadian Hydrogen Energy Company, the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of hydrogen-based emissions reduction and fuel saving devices. In 2007, he was elected as a director of the National Hydrogen Association, in Washington, D.C., and has served as a special advisor to the board of Skypower Ltd., one of Canada&#x27;s largest wind and solar power companies. He also developed a company which has worked with governments in Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Asia to raise awareness of biomass-to-energy power generation opportunities and clean water generation. 

From 2001 to 2011, Gilchrist served as a Director and then Vice-President of the Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust, a volunteer organization whose goal is to place conservation easements over private and publicly held land on the Oak Ridges Moraine. Since 2005, Gilchrist has also served as a director of the Ontario Association of Former Parliamentarians and, in August 2015, he was elected as the Chair of that organization. He has been active in a wide range of media, including serving as the alternate host for &quot;Politically Speaking&quot; on Rogers Television in Durham Region, a frequent guest of TV shows such as the Michael Coren Show on CTS and a contributor of many newspaper articles dealing with environmental and energy topics. In April 2022, he became the host of the &quot;Naturally Northumberland&quot; radio show on Northumberland 89.7 Radio in Cobourg, Ontario. In May 2022, he was elected to the Board of Directors of the Northumberland County Housing Corporation. In November 2021, Gilchrist graduated with a Master of Environmental Science degree from University of Toronto Scarborough.

In June 2007, Gilchrist was nominated as the Conservative Party of Canada&#x27;s candidate in Ajax—Pickering for the next federal election. In March 2008, Gilchrist announced that he was stepping down as the candidate in order to return his full attention to his alternative energy business interests, including a proposed waste-to-energy facility in Ghana and an advanced recycling technology for municipalities in Canada.

<text>The Lord President&#x27;s Committee was a United Kingdom cabinet committee during the Second World War. This committee oversaw many aspects of home affairs, most notably the economy, and was vital to the smooth running of the British war economy and consequently the entire British war effort. Because of this it was always headed by a senior politician and became one of the responsibilities given to successive Lord Presidents of the Council. These were:
*Neville Chamberlain (11 May 1940 – 3 October 1940)
*Sir John Anderson (3 October 1940 – 24 September 1943)

<doc id="1263716" wikidata="Q379624" url="?curid=1263716" title="Heraclius II of Georgia">
<text>Heraclius II, also known as Erekle II () and The Little Kakhetian ( ; 7 November 1720 or 7 October 1721 [according to C. Toumanoff] – 11 January 1798), of the Bagrationi dynasty, was the king (&quot;mepe&quot;) of the Kingdom of Kakheti from 1744 to 1762, and of the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti from 1762 until his death in 1798. In the contemporary Persian sources he is referred to as Erekli Khan (), while Russians knew him as Irakly (). Heraclius is the Latinized form of his name.

From being granted the kingship of Kakheti by his overlord Nader Shah in 1744 as a reward for his loyalty, to becoming the penultimate king of the united kingdoms of Kakheti and Kartli in eastern Georgia, his reign is regarded as the swan song of the Georgian monarchy. Aided by his personal abilities and the unrest in Iran following Nader Shah&#x27;s death, Heraclius established himself as a de facto autonomous ruler, unified eastern Georgia politically for the first time in three centuries, and attempted to modernize the government, economy, and military. Overwhelmed by the internal and external menaces to Georgia&#x27;s precarious independence and its temporary hegemony in eastern Transcaucasia, he placed his kingdom under the formal Russian protection in 1783, but the move did not prevent Georgia from being devastated by the Persian invasion in 1795. Heraclius died in 1798, leaving the throne to his moribund heir, George XII.

== Early years ==
Heraclius was born on 7 November 1720 (or 7 October 1721 according to the historian Cyril Toumanoff) in Telavi, capital of the Kingdom of Kakheti, son of Teimuraz II of Kakheti and his wife Tamar of Kartli, daughter of Vakhtang VI. His childhood and early teens coincided with the Ottoman occupation of Kakheti from 1732 until 1735, when they were expelled by Nader Shah&#x27;s Persian troops in two successive campaigns in 1734 and 1735, by which the latter quickly reestablished Persian rule over Georgia.

Teimuraz sided with the Persians and was installed as a Persian &quot;vali&quot; (governor) in Kakheti, while Kilij Ali-Khan (Khanjal) was made that of neighboring Kartli. However, many Georgian nobles refused to accept the new regime and rose in rebellion in response to heavy tribute levied by Nader upon the Georgian provinces. Nonetheless, Teimuraz and Heraclius remained loyal to the shah, partly in order to prevent the comeback of the rival Mukhrani branch, whose fall early in the 1720s had opened the way to Teimuraz&#x27;s accession in Kartli.

From 1737 to 1739, Heraclius commanded a Georgian auxiliary force during Nader&#x27;s expedition in India and gained a reputation of an able military commander. He then served as a lieutenant to his father and assumed the regency when Teimuraz was briefly summoned for consultations in the Persian capital of Isfahan in 1744. In the meantime, Heraclius defeated a coup attempt by the rival Georgian prince Abdullah Beg of the Mukhrani dynasty and helped Teimuraz suppress the aristocratic opposition to the Persian hegemony led by Givi Amilakhvari. As a reward, Nader granted the kingship of Kartli to Teimuraz and of Kakheti to Heraclius in 1744, and also arranged the marriage of his nephew Ali-Qoli Khan, who eventually would succeed him as Adel Shah, to Teimuraz&#x27;s daughter Ketevan.

===Nader&#x27;s death and reign in Kakheti===
Yet, both Georgian kingdoms remained under heavy Persian tribute until Nader was assassinated in 1747. Teimuraz and Heraclius took advantage of the ensuing political instability in Persia to assert their independence and expelled Persian garrisons from all key positions in Georgia, including Tbilisi. In close cooperation with each other, they managed to prevent a new revolt by the Mukhranian supporters fomented by Ebrahim Khan, brother of Adel Shah, in 1748. They concluded an anti-Persian alliance with the khans of Azerbaijan who were particularly vulnerable to the aggression from Persian warlords and agreed to recognize Heraclius&#x27;s supremacy in eastern Transcaucasia. In 1749, he occupied Yerevan, and in June 1751, Heraclius defeated a large army commanded by a pretender to the Persian throne and his former ally, Azat-Khan in the Battle of Kirkhbulakh. After these particular events, Heraclius could largely afford to ignore the changing situation to the south of the Aras River. In 1752, the Georgian kings sent a mission to Russia to request 3,000 Russian troops or a subsidy to enable them to hire Circassian mercenaries in order to invade Persia and install a pro-Russian government there. The embassy failed to yield any results, however, for the Russian court was preoccupied with European affairs.

== King of Kartli and Kakheti ==
Around the same time, it had become apparent that Mashhad, a minor Afsharid remnant, was no longer functioning as the seat of the Iranian government. In 1762, Teimuraz II died while on a diplomatic mission to the court of St. Petersburg, and Heraclius succeeded him as King of Kartli, thus uniting eastern Georgia politically for the first time in three centuries. In 1762–1763, during Karim Khan Zand&#x27;s campaigns in Azerbaijan, Heraclius II tendered his &quot;de jure&quot; submission to him and received his investiture as &quot;vali&quot; (&quot;governor&quot;, &quot;viceroy&quot;) of &quot;Gorjestan&quot; (Georgia), the traditional Safavid office, which by this time however had become an &quot;empty honorific&quot;.

=== Alliance with Russia ===
In foreign policy, Heraclius was primarily focused on seeking a reliable protector that would guarantee Georgia&#x27;s survival. He chose Russia not only because it was Orthodox Christian, but in Lang&#x27;s account also because it would serve as a link to Europe, which he thought a model for Georgia&#x27;s development as a modern nation. Yet, Heraclius&#x27;s initial cooperation with Russia proved disappointing. His participation in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) did not lead to an anticipated reconquest of the Ottoman-held southern Georgian lands, for the Russian commanders in Georgia behaved in a highly condescending, often treacherous way, and Empress Catherine II treated the Caucasus front as merely a secondary theater of military operations. Still, Heraclius continued to seek firmer alliance with Russia, his immediate motivation being the Persian ruler Karim Khan&#x27;s attempts to bring Georgia back into the Persian sphere of influence. Karim Khan&#x27;s death in 1779 temporarily relieved Heraclius of these dangers, as Persia again became engulfed in chaos.

In 1783, the Russian expansion southward into the Crimea brought the Caucasus into Catherine II&#x27;s area of interest. In the Treaty of Georgievsk of 1783, Heraclius finally obtained the guarantees he had sought from Russia, transforming Georgia into a Russian protectorate, as Heraclius formally repudiated all legal ties to Persia and placed his foreign policy under the Russian supervision. However, during the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792), a Tbilisi-based small Russian force evacuated Georgia, leaving Heraclius to face new dangers from Persia alone. In 1790 Heraclius concluded the Treaty of the Iberians with western Georgian polities.

=== Qajar invasion ===
Mohammad Khan Qajar, who had managed to bring most of central Iranian plateau under his firm control by 1794, was inclined to revive the Persian Empire with the Caucasus again as its part. In 1795, after a swift reconquest of much of southeastern Caucasus, he demanded that Heraclius reacknowledged Persian suzerainty, promising in return to confirm him as vali. Heraclius refused, and in September 1795, the Persian army of 35,000 moved into Georgia. After the valiant defense of Tbilisi at the Battle of Krtsanisi, in which the king participated personally in the advance guard, Heraclius&#x27;s small army of 5000 men was almost completely annihilated and Tbilisi completely sacked. While becoming a witness of the fearful devastation of his capital and slaughter of its civilians, king Heraclius, who did not want to leave the battlefield and the city was spirited away by the last of his bodyguards and a few family members. The Persian invasion delivered a hard blow to Georgia from which it was not able to recover. Despite being abandoned at the critical moment, he still had to rely on belated Russian support and fought, in 1796, alongside the Russian expeditionary forces sent by Catherine into the Persian territories. But her death that year brought an abrupt change of policy in the Caucasus, and her successor Paul I again withdrew all Russian troops from the region. Agha Mohammad launched his second campaign to punish the Georgians for their alliance with Russia. However, his assassination in 1797 spared Kartli-Kakheti more devastation.

=== Coinage ===
Heraclius II&#x27;s &quot;curiously ambivalent position&quot; in these decades is reflected in the coins issued by him in his realm. Silver coins were struck with the name of Ismail III on it, or with the Zand-style inscription &quot;ya karim&quot; (&quot;O Gracious One&quot;), whereby an epithet to God was invoked, which actually referred to Karim Khan Zand. These coins were minted in Tbilisi up until 1799 – some twenty years after Karim Khan Zand&#x27;s death. In the same decades, the copper coins struck at Tbilisi bore three types of iconography; Christian, Georgian, &quot;and even&quot; Imperial Russian (such as the double-headed eagle). By minting the silver coins with a reference to Karim Khan Zand on it they were usable for trade in Iran, whereas the copper coins, struck for only local use, reflected Heraclius II&#x27;s political orientation towards Russia.

=== Court, efforts and final years ===
While maintaining certain Persian-type pomp at his court, he launched an ambitious program of &quot;Europeanization&quot; which was supported by the Georgian intellectual élites, but was not overwhelmingly successful because Georgia remained physically isolated from Europe and had to expend all available resources on defending its precarious independence. He strove to enlist the support of European powers and to attract Western scientists and technicians to give his country the benefit of the latest military and industrial techniques. His style of governing resembled that of contemporary enlightened despots in Central Europe. He exercised executive, legislative, and judicial authority and closely supervised the activities of government departments. Heraclius&#x27;s primary objective in internal policy was to further centralize the government through reducing the powers of the aristocracy. For this purpose, he attempted to create a governing élite composed of his own agents to replace the self-minded aristocratic lords in local affairs. At the same time, he encouraged peasant-vassals to supply the military force necessary to overcome the aristocracy&#x27;s resistance and protect the country from incessant marauding assaults from Dagestan known to Georgians as Lekianoba. In the words of the British historian David Marshall Lang, &quot;his vigilance in the care of his people knew no bounds. On campaign, he would sit up at night watching for the enemy, while in time of peace, he spent his life in transacting business of state or in religious exercise, and devoted but a few hours to sleep.&quot;

Heraclius died in 1798 still convinced that only Russian protection could ensure the continued existence of his country. He was succeeded by his weak and sickly son, George XII, after whose death Tsar Paul I annexed, in 1801, Kartli-Kakheti to Russia, terminating both Georgia&#x27;s independence and a millennium-long rule of the Bagrationi dynasty.

===Reforms===
During his reign, Heraclius enacted several reforms. Printing in Tbilisi resumed in 1749 and Heraclius set up his press. He wanted to print canonical liturgical texts and to standardize a language. During his rule, over 40 titles were printed, almost all liturgical, in runs of up to 1000. Heraclius strengthened royal authority and organized it on Russian lines. He launched efforts to repopulate the lands of Kartli-Kakheti, abandoned due to constant wars and other social reasons. For this purpose, he appointed agents, &quot;Mkrelebi&quot;, who were tasked with returning refugee serfs in Nakhichevan and Karabakh back to their lands, even with violence. He also lured migrants with tax exemptions for them. Heraclius approved violence to stop serfs from complaining, but landowners were blamed for runaways and a severe punishment was employed on them for sexually abusing their serfs. Heraclius had hard time disciplining his nobles. He forbade selling serfs without land twice in 1754 and 1770. He, the Catholicos and the &quot;Darbazi&quot; announced that prisoners of war and slaves would become free peasants on crown lands. Under Heraclius’s rule, freemen were more common as some Church peasants and veteran soldiers became freemen, but in overall most of the peasants remained still serfs.

Heraclius modernized agriculture by growing new varieties of grain in Tusheti. Grain became chipper and famines ended. Peasants paid taxes in fruit or walnuts. Factories were producing sugar, glass, cloth and armaments. Half of a tonne of silver was produced each year. For this purpose, Heraclius invited Greek miners from Levan to work in gold and silver deposits in Akhtala. Inheritance laws were passed which introduced protections for properties of merchants against the crown. Customs duty was set at two and a half percent and revenues increased in the 1760s. Under Heraclius, &quot;mdivanbegis sasamartlo&quot; (chief secretary&#x27;s courts) was formed, while the king’s Darbazi was functioning as a permanent supreme court and privy council. There were two ministers of foreign affairs: one Christian and one Muslim. Heraclius also created a police force. Ancient universities of Tiflis and Telavi were restored, where Bachmeister was taught.

Heraclius&#x27;s policies and explotation of peasants by landowners often resulted in rebellions: when lord Eliozashvili demanded more than the usual 50 days&#x27; work on his estates, serfs revolted and attacked his family, burned his church and stole casks of wine. In 1773, Pshav tribesmen destroyed castle of their lord and held him hostage, while in 1777, Ksani peasants revolted against the initiative of Heraclius to reestablish Duchy of Ksani, abolished by his father. In 1780, Heraclius introduced bonds which compelled the wealthy to lend three tumans to the state, which also faced opposition. 

In 1770s, Heraclius reformed his army with Russian advisers, training manuals and ranks. He created a regiment of guards based on the European model. An army was permanently paid, although it was still allowed to loot. Tbilisi had a gunpowder factory, although in a state of ramshackle. In 1774, Heraclius introduced mandatory conscription – one man from household served one month per year on his own expenses. Civic development lagged behind and plague resulted in 4,000 deaths in 1770.

Due to the Lezgin raids on population and unwillingness of the peasants to submit to the conscription, Heraclius heavily relied on recruiting foreign mercenaries, particularly among Cherkess clan, which was more civil than Lezgins and had a close sympathy towards Georgians. 

== Family ==

Heraclius II was married three times; first, he married Princess Ketevan Orbeliani in 1738 or Princess Ketevan Pkheidze in 1740. According to a relatively recently established version, Princess Orbeliani was repudiated by Heraclius before the marriage actually took place. Instead, he married Princess Mkheidze, who died in 1744. Of his first marriage, Heraclius had two children:

*Prince Vakhtang (1738 or 1742 – 1 February, 1756 or 1760), Duke of Aragvi (1747–1756);

==Legacy==

King Heraclius occupies a special place among the Georgian monarchs, with his name being associated with chivalry and valour among Georgians. However, Heraclius&#x27;s decision to sign Treaty of Georgievsk with Russia has been a matter of dispute among Georgians since the 19th century. It has been reported that those with different views on how to manage relations with Russia accordingly have different interpretations of Heraclius&#x27;s move. For example, the &quot;Society of Erekle II&quot;, established in 2009, seeks closer ties with Russia as opposed to the integration with the West. They primarily justify their position by alluding to Heraclius&#x27;s decision and claim that the Orthodox kinship with Russia was of paramount importance to preserve Georgian nationhood, while European culture may pose a threat to Georgian spirituality, especially Orthodox Christianity as a pillar of Georgianness. Others who hold more pro-Western views emphasize that King Heraclius saw Russia as a window to European civilization.

Erekleoba is an annual, traditional public feast celebrated at Hereclius II&#x27;s palace in Eastern Georgia&#x27;s city of Telavi on November 7 to pay tribute to his memory.

<text>Robert Edward Simon, Jr. (April 10, 1914 – September 21, 2015) was an American real estate entrepreneur, most known for founding the community of Reston, Virginia. He was the maternal uncle of feminist historian and writer Elizabeth Fox-Genovese.

== Early life ==
Simon was born in New York City in 1914, the son of Robert Sr. and Elsa Weil Simon, immigrants from Germany. He was raised in Manhattan along with his four siblings. He was of Jewish descent.

==Career==
===Reston===
After graduating from Harvard University, Simon took over the family real estate management and development business. In 1961, with the proceeds from the sale of a family property, Carnegie Hall, Simon purchased 6,750 acres (27 km2) of land in Fairfax County, Virginia and hired Conklin + Rossant to develop a master plan for the new town of Reston, Virginia, a planned community well known on the national level. (The town&#x27;s name was derived from Simon&#x27;s initials and the word &quot;town&quot;.)
Simon&#x27;s new town concept emphasized quality of life for the individual and provided a community where people could live, work, and play without driving long distances.

Simon returned to live in an apartment near Lake Anne in Reston in 1993 and helped celebrate Reston&#x27;s 40th birthday in 2004.
In that same year a bronze statue of Simon was placed on a park bench in Washington Plaza on Lake Anne, the original heart of the community he built.

A collection of Simon&#x27;s donated materials is housed at the Specials Collections Research Center at the George Mason University Libraries.

==Personal life==
Simon married four times. He was married to author and environmentalist Anne Wertheim Langman, daughter of Maurice Wertheim, and granddaughter of Henry Morgenthau Sr.

He died in Reston, Virginia in September 2015 at the age of 101. He was survived by his fourth wife (married 2004), Cheryl Terio-Simon; a daughter, Margo Prescott-Morris her 2 children (Robert&#x27;s grandchildren) Christine Doolin, Noah Prescott along with great-grandchildren Sara Collier, Austin Ingram, Ashton Prescott and 8 great-great grandchildren. Also his six stepchildren, Karen Terio, Betsy Langman Schulberg (married and divorced from Budd Schulberg), Deborah Langman Lesser, Lucinda Zilk, Tom Langman, and Adam Terio.

<text>The Hyborian Age is a fictional period of Earth&#x27;s history within the artificial mythology created by Robert E. Howard, serving as the setting for the sword and sorcery tales of Conan the Barbarian.

The word &quot;Hyborian&quot; is derived from the legendary northern land of the ancient Greeks, Hyperborea, and it is rendered as such in the earliest draft of Howard&#x27;s essay &quot;The Hyborian Age&quot;. Howard described the Hyborian Age taking place sometime after the sinking of Atlantis and before the beginning of recorded ancient history. Most later editors and adaptors such as L. Sprague de Camp and Roy Thomas placed the Hyborian Age around 10,000 BC. More recently, Dale Rippke proposed that the Hyborian Age should be placed further in the past, around 32,500 BC, prior to the beginning of the Last Glacial Maximum. Rippke&#x27;s date, however, has since been disputed by Jeffrey Shanks, who argues for the more traditional placement at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum.

Howard had an intense love for history and historical dramas; however, at the same time, he recognized the difficulties and the time-consuming research needed in maintaining historical accuracy. By conceiving a timeless setting – a &quot;vanished&quot; age – and by carefully choosing names that resembled our history, Howard avoided the problem of historical anachronisms and the need for lengthy exposition.

==Fictional history==

===Cataclysmic ancestors===
Howard explained the origins and history of the Hyborian civilization in his essay &quot;The Hyborian Age&quot;. The essay begins with the end of the Thurian Age (the setting for Howard&#x27;s King Kull stories) and the destruction of its civilizations, Lemuria and Atlantis, by a geological .

After this cataclysm, the surviving humans were reduced to a primitive state and a technological level hardly above the Neanderthal. Several such tribes migrated to the northern areas of what was left of the Thurian continent to escape destruction. They discovered the region to be safe, but covered with snow and already inhabited by a race of vicious white-furred apes. A vicious territorial war ensued until the humans drove the apes further North, past the Arctic Circle. Believing the apes were destined to perish, the humans turned to taming their harsh new home.

===Hyborian ancestors===
One thousand five hundred years later, the descendants of this initial group were called &quot;Hyborians&quot;. They were named after their highest ranking god deity, Bori. The essay mentions that Bori had actually been a great tribal chief of their past who had undergone deification. Their oral tradition remembered him as their leader during their initial migration to the north, though the antiquity of this man had been exaggerated.

By this point, the various related but independent Hyborian tribes had spread throughout the northern regions of their area of the world. Some of them were already migrating south at a &quot;leisurely&quot; pace in search of new areas in which to settle. The Hyborians had yet to encounter other cultural groups, but engaged in wars against each other. Howard describes them as a powerful and warlike race with the average individual being tall, tawny-haired, and gray-eyed. Culturally, they were accomplished artists and poets. Most of the tribes still relied on hunting for their nourishment. Their southern offshoots, however, had been practicing animal husbandry of cattle for centuries.

The only exception to their long isolation from other cultural groups came due to the actions of a lone adventurer, unnamed in the essay. He had traveled past the Arctic Circle and returned with news that their old adversaries, the apes, were never annihilated. They had instead evolved into apemen and, according to his description, were by then numerous. He believed they were quickly evolving to human status and would pose a threat to the Hyborians in the future. He attempted to recruit a significant military force to campaign against them, but most Hyborians were not convinced by his tales; only a small group of foolhardy youths followed his campaign. None of them returned.

===Beginnings of the Hyborian Age===
With the population of the Hyborian tribes continuing to increase, the need for new lands also increased. The Hyborians expanded outside their familiar territories, beginning a new age of wanderings and conquests. For 500 years, the Hyborians spread towards the south and the west of their nameless continent.

They encountered other tribal groups for the first time in millennia. They conquered many smaller clans of various origins. The survivors of the defeated clans merged with their conquerors, passing on their racial traits to new generations of Hyborians. The mixed-blooded Hyborian tribes were in turn forced to defend their new territories from pure-blooded Hyborian tribes which followed the same paths of migration. Often, the new invaders would wipe away the defenders before absorbing them, resulting in a tangled web of Hyborian tribes and nations with varying ancestral elements within their bloodlines.

The first organized Hyborian kingdom to emerge was Hyperborea. The tribe that established it entered their Neolithic age by learning to erect buildings in stone, largely for fortification. These nomads lived in tents made out of the hides of horses, but soon abandoned them in favor of their crude but durable stone houses. They permanently settled in fortified settlements and developed cyclopean masonry to further fortify their defensive walls.

The Hyperboreans were by then the most advanced of the Hyborian tribes and set out to expand their kingdom by attacking their backwards neighbors. Tribes who defended their territories lost them and were forced to migrate elsewhere. Others fled the path of Hyperborean expansion before ever engaging them in war. Meanwhile, the apemen of the Arctic Circle emerged as a new race of light-haired and tall humans. They started their own migration to the south, displacing the northernmost of the Hyborian tribes.

===Rulers of the West===
For the next thousand years, the warlike Hyborian nations advanced to become the rulers of the western areas of the nameless continent. They encountered the Picts and forced them back to the western wastelands, which would come to be known as the &quot;Pictish Wilderness&quot;. Following the example of their Hyperborean cousins, other Hyborians migrated Southward and created their own kingdoms.

The southernmost of the early kingdoms was Koth, which was established north of the lands of Shem and soon started extending its cultural influence over the southern shepherds. Just south of the Pictish Wilderness was the fertile valley known as &quot;Zing&quot;. The wandering Hyborian tribe which conquered it found other people already settled there. They included a nameless farming nation related to the people of the Shem and a warlike Pictish tribe who had previously conquered them. They established the kingdom of Zingara and absorbed the defeated elements into their tribe. Hyborians, Picts, and the unnamed kin of the Shemites would merge into a nation calling themselves Zingarans.

On the other hand, at the north of the continent, the fair-haired invaders from the Arctic Circle had grown in numbers and power. They continued their expansion south while in turn displacing defeated Hyborians to the south. Even Hyperborea was conquered by one of these barbarian tribes. But the conquerors here decided to maintain the kingdom with its old name, merged with the defeated Hyperboreans and adopted elements of Hyborian culture. The continuing wars and migrations would keep the state of the other areas of the continent for another five hundred years.

==The world==
The Hyborian Age was devised by author Robert E. Howard as the post-Atlantean setting of his Conan the Cimmerian stories, designed to fit in with Howard&#x27;s previous and lesser known tales of Kull, which were set in the Thurian Age at the time of Atlantis. The name &quot;Hyborian&quot; is a contraction of the Greek concept of the land of &quot;Hyperborea&quot;, literally &quot;Beyond the North Wind&quot;. This was a mythical place far to the north that was not cold and where things did not age.

Howard&#x27;s Hyborian epoch, described in his essay &quot;The Hyborian Age&quot;, is a mythical time before any civilization known to anthropologists. Its setting is prehistoric Europe and North Africa (with occasional references to Asia and other continents).

On a map Howard drew conceptualizing the Hyborian Age, his vision of the Mediterranean Sea is dry. The Nile, which he renamed the River Styx, takes a westward turn at right angles just beyond the Nile Delta, plowing through the mountains so as to be able to reach the Straits of Gibraltar. Although his Black Sea is also dry, his Caspian Sea, which he renames the Vilayet Sea, extends northward to reach the Arctic Ocean, so as to provide a barrier to encapsulate the settings of his stories. Not only are his Baltic Sea and English Channel dry, but most of the North Sea and a vast region to the west, easily including Ireland, are, too. Meanwhile, the west coast of Africa on his map lies beneath the sea.

===Nations and landmarks===
In his fantasy setting of the Hyborian Age, Howard created imaginary kingdoms to which he gave names inspired by or adapted from a variety of mythological and historical sources. Khitai is his version of China, lying far to the east; Corinthia is his name for a Hellenistic civilization, a name derived from the city of Corinth and reminiscent of the imperial fief of Carinthia in the Middle Ages. Howard imagines the Hyborian Picts occupying a large area in the northwest. The probable intended analogues are listed below; notice that the analogues are sometimes very generalized, and are portrayed by &quot;non-historical&quot; stereotypes. Most of these correspondences are drawn from &quot;Hyborian Names&quot;, an appendix featured in &quot;Conan the Swordsman&quot; by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter.
==Deities==
The Stygian followers of Set worship their deity with human sacrifice and actively venerate serpents, and Ishtar&#x27;s worshippers follow the pleasures of the flesh. In Vendhya, the followers of Asura seek truth beyond the illusions of the physical world, and the Hyborian devotees of Mitra are almost Christian in their merging of asceticism with a commitment to compassion and justice.

===Crom===
Crom is a deity in Robert E. Howard&#x27;s fantasy tales of the Hyborian Age. He is acknowledged as the chief god by the lead character Conan, and his proto-Celtic Cimmerian people.

The name &quot;Crom&quot; is probably derived from the Old Irish deity Crom Cruach or Crom Dubh.

Crom is the chief god of the Cimmerian pantheon, and he lives on a great mountain, from where he sends forth doom or death. It is considered useless to call upon Crom, because he is a gloomy and savage god who hates weaklings. However, Crom gives a man courage, free will, and the strength to fight his enemies, which the Cimmerians believe is all that is needed from him. Crom doesn&#x27;t care if individuals live or die, and his name is typically only invoked as an oath or curse. He is the only member of the Cimmerian pantheon named with any regularity.

Crom is never depicted as directly intervening or otherwise explicitly causing any event in the original Conan stories by Robert E. Howard. There is little consistent evidence in his works that Crom actually exists, in contrast to the demons and highly advanced aliens appearing in &quot;The God in the Bowl&quot; and &quot;The Tower of the Elephant&quot;, while the story &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot; implies that Set is one of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Great Old Ones. Howard&#x27;s story &quot;Black Colossus&quot; features a princess vocally directed by Mitra to recruit Conan as her champion, but Crom makes no such appearances.

Crom is exclusively a Cimmerian god, with other civilizations paying him little attention, and Conan swearing with Crom&#x27;s name immediately identifies him as a Cimmerian.

===Mitra===
Mitra is a personification of good, popular amongst people of the era.

He is probably loosely based on the Vedic and Zoroastrian figure by the same name, and in the Hyborian universe, his worship generally represents Christianity. In the essay &quot;The Hyborian Age&quot;, Howard writes that followers of Mitra are urged to forgive their enemies (though many of them fail to do so). Mitra&#x27;s religion is missionary; its adherents are sometimes martyred trying to spread their faith to hostile peoples.

Mitra&#x27;s worship is dominant, effectively the state religion, in the Hyborian countries corresponding to modern Western Europe. In lands corresponding to Asia and Africa, Mitra is, at best, one god among many, and his worship is forbidden in Stygia (Egypt and North Africa).

Mitra is the chief god of most of the civilized Hyborian kingdoms, including Aquilonia, Ophir, Nemedia, Brythunia, Corinthia, and Zingara. His worshippers are monolatristic, since at least one tale depicts priests of Mitra recognizing the existence of Set. He is depicted as a &quot;gentle&quot; god. In Khoraja, which is on the border between the Hyborian kingdoms and the Shemite ones, the worship of Mitra was largely forgotten in favor of the Shemite gods – but in hours of great need, Khorajans still call on Mitra and are answered (&quot;Black Colossus&quot;).

While Mitra and his followers are in general presented favorably in the Conan stories, in Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Hour of the Dragon&quot; they intolerantly persecute followers of Asura. Conan, being a &quot;barbarian&quot;, does not share this &quot;civilized&quot; prejudice and protects Asura&#x27;s followers, who prove helpful later.

The Mitra cult never practices sacrifice and values aesthetic simplicity. Thus, his shrines are usually unadorned and feature little or no iconography except for a single idol. The idol itself has the appearance of an idealized, bearded male figure and is the primary object of worship. However, being omnipresent and incorporeal, Mitra is not considered to reside in the icon, nor share its appearance. He is also symbolically represented by a phoenix in Howard&#x27;s writing, by an Ankh in the &quot;Age of Conan&quot; MMORPG, and by a bronze colossus in the survival video game &quot;Conan Exiles&quot;.

Mitra appears directly in Howard&#x27;s &quot;Black Colossus&quot;, where he speaks to Princess Yasmela of Khoraja and guides her in an hour of desperate danger. Mitra&#x27;s involvement has a significant effect on Conan&#x27;s career. Though he had never commanded more than a &quot;company of cut-throats&quot;, Conan emerges as a victorious general in a historically important battle involving tens of thousands of soldiers. Though Conan&#x27;s career would know many more ups and downs, this was an important step towards eventually becoming a king. From Mitra&#x27;s point of view, Conan was evidently the best choice to defeat a sworn enemy of the Hyborian kingdoms.

===Skelos===
Skelos is mentioned in &quot;The People of the Black Circle&quot;, &quot;The Hour of the Dragon&quot; and in the verse prologue to &quot;The Pool of the Black One&quot;. He is an evil god of death, and as many such ones, Odin for one, he is connected to wisdom and learning. The Bible of maltheists and necromancers in Conan’s days is called &quot;The Book of Skelos&quot;, whose author is Vathelos the Blind.

The blind seer Tiresias in Greek mythology was strongly connected to Hades, the realm of the dead. In Homer’s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Odysseus travels to Cimmeria, the forecourt of Hades, to confer with the shade of Tiresias.

Vatellen is the name of a volcanic mountain in reality lying where Luxor, capital of Stygia lies in the world of Conan. In &quot;The Hour of the Dragon&quot; Orastes resurrects Xaltotun with an incantation of Skelos, &quot;Ancient when Atlantis sank&quot;, i.e. much older than Stygia, let alone Set-worship. The idol worshipped by the dark priest-mage Rotath in the Kull story &quot;The Curse of the Golden Skull&quot; seems to be a grinning skull. In this story an earlier version of &quot;The Book of Skelos&quot; is mentioned. The god of Rotath is identical with the dark nameless god worshipped by Thuron in &quot;The Altar and the Scorpion&quot;. Skelos is one aspect of this great nameless one.

<text>Alexander Baumann, (born April 21, 1964) is a Canadian sports administrator and former competitive swimmer who won two gold medals and set two world records at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2007, he was regarded by the CBC, the national broadcaster, as &quot;the greatest swimmer in Canadian history&quot;, as the twin Olympic gold medals were Canada&#x27;s first in swimming since 1912.

Since he retired from competitive swimming, he has worked as an administrator in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

In May 2021, Baumann was appointed Chief Executive of Swimming Australia. At the end of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics held in 2021, Baumann subsequently resigned the position of CEO in August 2021, citing health reasons.

==Early years==
Born in Prague (former Czechoslovakia), Baumann was raised in Canada after his family moved there in 1969 following the Prague Spring. The family settled in Sudbury, Ontario, where, at the age of nine, Baumann became involved in competitive swimming, training at Laurentian University.

==Olympic career==
By the time he was seventeen, Baumann owned 38 Canadian swimming records and the world record in the 200-metre individual medley. He accepted a swimming scholarship and entered Indiana University to train under its legendary coach James &quot;Doc&quot; Counsilman; however with chronic pain in his shoulder, he made the decision to return to Sudbury to continue physical therapy and training under the direction of his long-time coach, Dr. Jeno Tihanyi. Forced to sit out the 1982 World Aquatic Championships in Ecuador due to his injury, Baumann&#x27;s training progressed enough that he was able to win gold in both 200 and 400-metre individual medley events at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, Australia, lowering his world record in the 200-metre event to 2:02.25 in the process. It was here that he met his future wife Australian swimmer Tracey Taggart. He also won the 400-metre individual medley event at the 1983 World University Games.

Prior to the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Baumann&#x27;s father died of complications from diabetes and his brother, Roman, died by suicide. Baumann persevered through these tragedies, as well as his lingering tendinitis and shoulder injuries, to enter the Olympics as one of Canada&#x27;s best Olympic hopes.

At the 1984 Olympics, Baumann was selected as Canada&#x27;s flagbearer for the opening ceremonies. He won gold medals in the 400-metre individual medley, setting a world record time of 4:17.41, and the 200-metre race, lowering the world mark to 2:01.42. The 400-metre gold was Canada&#x27;s first in swimming since 1912.

Baumann continued his swimming career with three gold medals at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh in the two individual medley events, and swimming anchor on Canada&#x27;s 4 × 100 m medley relay team. However, later that year, he won a silver and a bronze at the 1986 World Aquatics Championships in Madrid, Spain losing to a 19-year-old Hungarian swimmer, Tamás Darnyi.

Baumann shared a close bond with his coach of 14 years, Dr. Jeno Tihanyi. After the 1984 Olympics, the two authored a book titled &quot;Swimming with Alex Baumann: A Program for Competitive and Recreational Swimmers&quot;.

==Sports administration==

Subsequent to the 1987 Pacific Championships in Australia, Baumann retired from competitive swimming, initially working with Canadian broadcaster CBC for the 1988 Olympics, and also returning to Sudbury as a coach until 1991. Some speculated that Baumann was unable to find a coaching position due to his outspokenness. He criticized the Canadian Olympic Committee for dismissing Don Talbot and replacing him with Dave Johnson, as it was widely alleged that Talbot was fired for refusing to put the daughter of a Committee member on the national team. Baumann also criticized Swimming Canada for its subpar performances at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland in 1990.

===1996-2006: In Queensland Australia===
Baumann moved to Australia to enter graduate studies at the University of Queensland before becoming manager of sport programs with the Queensland Academy of Sport between 1996 and 1997. He then held various positions with the Queensland Government before becoming CEO of Queensland Swimming in 1999.

After a poor showing by Canada at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Baumann felt he had more to offer Canadian sport, and expressed interest in taking on the vacant leadership position at the Canadian Olympic Committee; however, the COC felt he did not have the business background to handle the job. Ultimately, Baumann was not offered the Canadian Olympic Committee position. This caused some controversy and criticism in Canada as many Canadian athletes and citizens felt he was the best choice for the job. A number of foreign sports organizations felt the same way, and he was courted heavily by the English Institute of Sport and the Queensland Academy of Sport, ultimately accepting the position of executive director for the Queensland Academy of Sport in 2002.

In 2004, after a dismal showing by Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, in which they failed to medal and their best finish was sixth place, head coach Dave Johnson was fired. The COC offered Baumann the CEO or head coaching position of Swimming Canada (Karen Spierkel had resigned as CEO on 3 May 2003 after the controversy surrounding Jennifer Carroll waving a Quebec flag on the podium during the 2002 Commonwealth Games) but he turned both down, saying that he would remain with the Queensland Academy. Several commentators panned Baumann as hypocritical as he was publicly critical of the Canadian swim program for several years from 2000 to 2004, right up to the Athens Olympics . In response, Baumann toned down his criticism.

===2006-2012: Head of Canada&#x27;s Summer Olympic Program===
On 27 September 2006, the Canadian Olympic Committee announced that Baumann was hired to take over Canada&#x27;s Road to Excellence initiative beginning in January 2007. Canada had achieved mediocre results at the 2004 Athens Olympics with a tally of only 12 medals in all events, which resulted in an overall 21st place national showing. These poor results prompted much criticism from Canadians. At that time, Baumann announced a goal for Team Canada: a top 16 finish in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and a top 12 finish at the 2012 London Games.

In the Beijing event, for the first time Canadian athletes were paid for medals earned. Gold medalists earned $20,000; silver medalists were paid $15,000; and bronze medalists $10,000. A total of $515,000 from the Athlete Excellence Fund was given to the medal winning athletes. At the Beijing Olympiad, Canada wound up finishing 19th in gold medals and 14th in total medals, and Baumann&#x27;s methods were vindicated.

In the 2012 London Olympic Games with the initiation of its &quot;Own the Podium&quot; programme, Canada finished 13th in total medals, thus improving on its performance in Beijing while falling somewhat short of its self-declared goal of 12th position. It finished the event with 18 medals: one gold, five silver and 12 bronze.

===2012-2017: Head of High Performance Sport New Zealand===
On 15 January 2012, High Performance Sport New Zealand announced the appointment of Baumann to the role of Chief Executive, effective 31 January 2012.

Baumann resigned in June 2017 due to the desire to move back to Australia to be closer to his children and extended family. Whilst he was in this position at the 2016 Rio Olympics, New Zealand won 18 medals in nine different sports, of which four were gold.

===Swimming Australia===
In April 2021 Alex Baumann was appointed as the Chief Executive of Swimming Australia.
In December 2017, Swimming Australia announced that it had appointed Baumann to the new role as Swimming Australia&#x27;s Chief Strategist, High Performance.

On 9 August 2021 Baumann announced his resignation as the CEO of Swimming Australia after only 3 months of tenure, citing health concerns and wanting to spend more time with his family.

==Awards and honours==
Baumann was named Canada&#x27;s male athlete of the year for 1984 and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was also named the Male World Swimmer of the Year by &quot;Swimming World magazine&quot; in the same year. In 1988, he was awarded the Order of Ontario.

Baumann was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1999.

Baumann was named Honorary Colonel of 412 VIP Transport Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force based in Ottawa in June 2011.

In 2012, Baumann received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.

==Personal life==
Baumann is married to Tracey Taggart, an Australian swimmer he met during the Brisbane 1982 Commonwealth Games. They married on 30 April 1988, and have two children: Tabitha and Ashton Baumann.

In March 2009, Baumann swam at the Ontario Masters Swim Championships. It was his first swim meet in 22 years. He continued where he left off, beating the world record in the 200 metre individual medley in the 45-49 age group category by more than 3.3 seconds with a time of 2:12.01.

His son, Ashton Baumann, is also a swimmer.

<doc id="1263740" wikidata="Q1351527" url="?curid=1263740" title="Tom Paxton">
<text>Thomas Richard Paxton (born October 31, 1937) is an American folk singer-songwriter who has had a music career spanning more than sixty years. In 2009, Paxton received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He is a music educator as well as an advocate for folk singers to combine traditional songs with new compositions.

Paxton&#x27;s songs have been widely recorded, including modern standards such as &quot;The Last Thing on My Mind&quot;, &quot;Bottle of Wine&quot;, &quot;Whose Garden Was This&quot;, &quot;The Marvelous Toy&quot;, and &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Boy&quot;. Paxton&#x27;s songs have been recorded by Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, the Weavers, Judy Collins, Sandy Denny, Joan Baez, Doc Watson, Harry Belafonte, Peter, Paul and Mary, the Seekers, Marianne Faithfull, the Kingston Trio, the Chad Mitchell Trio, John Denver, Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Flatt &amp; Scruggs, the Move, the Fireballs, Francesco Guccini and many others (see covers).

==Early life==
Paxton was born on October 31, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, to Burt and Esther Paxton. His father was &quot;a chemist, mostly self-educated&quot;, and as his health began to fail him, the family moved to Wickenburg, Arizona, where the young Paxton began riding horses at the numerous dude ranches in the area and was also first introduced to folk music, discovering the music of Burl Ives and others.

In 1948, the family moved to Bristow, Oklahoma, which Paxton considers to be his hometown. Soon after, his father died from a stroke. Paxton was about 15 when he received his first stringed instrument, a ukulele. He was given a guitar by his aunt when he was sixteen, and he soon began to immerse himself in the music of Ives and Harry Belafonte.

In 1955, Paxton enrolled at the University of Oklahoma, where he studied in the drama school. It was here that he first found other enthusiasts of folk music and discovered the music of Woody Guthrie and the Weavers. He would later note, &quot;Woody was fearless; he&#x27;d take on any issue that got him stirred up ... and he became one of my greatest influences.&quot; In college, he was in a group known as the Travellers, which sang in an off-campus coffeehouse.

==Career==
===Early career===

Upon graduating in 1959 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, Paxton acted in summer stock theatre and briefly tried graduate school before joining the Army. While attending the Clerk Typist School in Fort Dix, New Jersey, he began writing songs on his typewriter and spent almost every weekend visiting Greenwich Village in New York City during the emerging early 1960s folk revival.

Shortly after his honorable discharge from the Army, Paxton auditioned for the Chad Mitchell Trio via publisher Milt Okun in 1960. He initially received the part, but his voice did not blend well enough with those of the group members. However, after singing his song &quot;The Marvelous Toy&quot; for Okun, he became the first writer signed to Milt&#x27;s music publishing company, Cherry Lane Music Publishing.

Paxton soon began performing at The Gaslight Cafe in Greenwich Village, where he became a mainstay. In 1962, he recorded a privately produced live album at the Gaslight entitled, &quot;I&#x27;m the Man That Built the Bridges&quot;. During his stay in Greenwich Village, Paxton published some of his songs in the folk magazines &quot;Broadside&quot; and &quot;Sing Out!&quot;, and performed alongside such folksingers as Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Eric Andersen, Dave Van Ronk, and Mississippi John Hurt. Paxton met his future wife, Margaret Ann Cummings (known as &quot;Midge&quot;), at the Gaslight one night in January 1963 after being introduced to her by David Blue.

Pete Seeger learned a few of Paxton&#x27;s songs in 1963, including &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Boy&quot; (which Seeger performed at The Weavers reunion concert at Carnegie Hall) and &quot;What Did You Learn in School Today?&quot; Paxton increased his profile as a performer, appearing at the 1963 Newport Folk Festival, which was recorded by Vanguard Records. A month after Newport in 1963, Paxton married Midge. He began traveling the country on the coffeehouse and small-venue circuit before returning to New York. Paxton became involved with causes that promoted human rights, civil rights and labor rights. In 1963, Paxton and a group of other folk musicians performed and offered moral support to striking coal miners in Hazard, Kentucky. 

After returning to New York in 1964, Paxton signed with Elektra Records, a label which at that time featured a distinguished roster of folk musicians. He would go on to record seven albums for Elektra. As the folk revival hit its peak, Paxton began getting more work outside of New York City, including benefit concerts and college campus visits. In 1964, he took part in the Freedom Summer and visited the Deep South, with other folk musicians, to perform at voter registration drives and civil rights rallies. His civil rights song &quot;Beau John&quot; was written after attending a Freedom Song Workshop in Atlanta, Georgia, and the song &quot;Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney&quot; was written about the murders of three civil rights activists (Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner, and James Chaney) in the summer of 1964 by members of the Ku Klux Klan near Philadelphia, Mississippi. Paxton&#x27;s own compositions began to be increasingly recognized within folk music circles, and in other genres.

Of the songwriters on the Greenwich Village scene of the 1960s, Dave Van Ronk said, &quot;Dylan is usually cited as the founder of the new song movement, and he certainly became its most visible standard-bearer, but the person who started the whole thing was Tom Paxton ... he tested his songs in the crucible of live performance, he found that his own stuff was getting more attention than when he was singing traditional songs or stuff by other people ... he set himself a training regimen of deliberately writing one song every day. Dylan had not yet showed up when this was happening, and by the time Bobby came on the set, with at most two or three songs he had written, Tom was already singing at least 50 percent his own material. That said, it was Bobby&#x27;s success that really got the ball rolling. Prior to that, the folk community was very much tied to traditional songs, so much so that songwriters would sometimes palm their own stuff off as traditional.&quot;

In 1965, Paxton made his first tour of the United Kingdom. The tour was the beginning of a still-thriving professional relationship that has included yearly performances there. He met Bruce Woodley, one of the founding members of the Australian folk group The Seekers and they collaborated on the song &quot;Angeline (Is Always Friday)&quot; which The Seekers recorded and featured in their concerts, TV shows and a DVD. In 1967, the rock group Clear Light recorded a menacing and lengthy psychedelic version of Paxton&#x27;s song &quot;Mr. Blue&quot; on their only album &quot;Clear Light&quot;. Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton&#x27;s recording of &quot;The Last Thing on My Mind&quot; reached the top ten on the U.S. country singles charts in December 1967. Then in 1968, Paxton scored a Top 10 radio hit when The Fireballs recorded his song &quot;Bottle of Wine&quot;. In the 1960s, Paxton licensed one of his songs, &quot;My Dog&#x27;s Bigger than Your Dog&quot;, for use in a Ken-L Ration dog food commercial. Not too fazed by the success of some of his songs, Paxton continued writing and performing. He was not interested in jumping on the folk rock (or, as he once joked, &quot;folk rot&quot;) bandwagon though, and continued his folk singer-songwriter style on albums like &quot;Outward Bound&quot; (1966) and &quot;Morning Again&quot; (1968). On January 20, 1968, three months after the death of Woody Guthrie, Paxton and a number of other prominent folk musicians performed at the Harold Leventhal produced &quot;A Tribute to Woody Guthrie&quot; concert at New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall.

Paxton decided to try some more elaborate recording techniques, including neo-chamber music with string sections, flutes, horns, piano, various session musicians, as well as his acoustic guitar and vocals, similar to what his labelmate Judy Collins and his friend Phil Ochs were experimenting with around this time. Paxton finally broke into the album pop charts himself with &quot;The Things I Notice Now&quot; in the summer of 1969, and also charted with &quot;Tom Paxton 6&quot; in the spring of the following year. His song &quot;Whose Garden Was This&quot;, an environmentalist anthem written for the first Earth Day, was later recorded by John Denver and became the title track of Denver&#x27;s 1970 album. Another Paxton song Denver recorded was &quot;Forest Lawn&quot;, in whose lyrics Paxton satirized the &quot;theme park approach&quot; to death that Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, has been accused of having taken.

The diverse &quot;Baroque Folk&quot; experimentation on Paxton&#x27;s recordings was basically short-lived though, and he tended to think that the music was becoming too overproduced and away from the more natural acoustic roots that he loved best. Regarding this time, he said, &quot;the acoustic guitar has always been what I loved the most ... I &quot;know&quot; I didn&#x27;t have that rock mentality or anything. I was still a kid from a small town in Oklahoma. And I just wanted to hear folk songs.&quot; Paxton continued to sing and perform his songs on acoustic guitar at his live performances, and it was not too long before his albums would once again generally reflect his original traditional-sounding style.

===Middle career===
Paxton, his wife and their two daughters lived in Holland Park, London, for about four years in the early 1970s. After a stay in England due to professional success and love of the country, Paxton and Midge went on a tour of New Zealand and China and even appeared on a Chinese talk show. Paxton released &quot;How Come the Sun&quot; in 1971. The album gave him his highest chart ranking in the U.S. but it only reached number 120 and his next album, &quot;Peace Will Come&quot; (1972), barely even reached the charts. He soon returned to New York City and the Long Island town of East Hampton before moving to the Washington, D.C., area around 1977. After recording three albums for Reprise Records and a few for &quot;an English label that didn&#x27;t pan out well&quot;, Paxton signed with Vanguard Records, with whom he recorded a live album with Steve Goodman, &quot;New Songs From the Briarpatch&quot; (1977), which contained some of Paxton&#x27;s topical songs of the 1970s, including &quot;Talking Watergate&quot; and &quot;White Bones of Allende&quot; as well as a song dedicated to Mississippi John Hurt entitled &quot;Did You Hear John Hurt?&quot; In 1978, Paxton released his album &quot;Heroes&quot;, which contained a song, &quot;Phil&quot;, about his friend Phil Ochs, who had taken his own life in 1976. The album also includes the song &quot;The Death of Stephen Biko&quot;, which details the murder of anti-apartheid activist Stephen Biko in South Africa. 
Paxton&#x27;s 1979 album, &quot;Up and Up&quot;, contains the song &quot;Let the Sunshine&quot;, which addresses issues concerning environmentalism and solar energy. Paxton has also performed at the Clearwater Festival, an annual event, started by Pete Seeger, dedicated to environmentalism and cleaning up the Hudson River. His 1983 album &quot;Bulletin&quot; includes a song about Woody Guthrie entitled &quot;They Couldn&#x27;t Take the Music&quot;.

After recording for labels such as Mountain Railroad and Flying Fish in the 1980s, Paxton started his own label, Pax Records, in 1987. It was during this time that Paxton continued to suffer from an undiagnosed and deepening depression that affected his work. With some advice from Midge, he began to look for a solution and was eventually diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, for which he received ongoing treatment.

===Later career===
In the 1990s, Paxton began delving deeply into children&#x27;s music, recording nine children&#x27;s albums during the decade. In July 1994, Paxton was invited to perform at a folk festival in Israel, &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, and he played there and a series of concerts around Israel accompanied by folk guitarist and harmonica player Shay Tochner. Paxton recorded a live album in 1996 with his good friend Jim Rooney, and it contained some new comical songs about current events. Eric Weissberg, John Gorka, Robin and Linda Williams, among others, also performed; and the album was titled &quot;Live: For the Record&quot;. In the mid-1990s, Paxton also began to give more workshops in songwriting. 

In 2000, Paxton once again began to write more of the topical songs that had been prominent during his early career. In 2001, he released an album with Anne Hills entitled &quot;Under American Skies&quot;, and in 2002, he released an album of all new songs entitled &quot;Looking for the Moon&quot; (Appleseed Recordings). At the time of its release, Paxton was quoted saying that it might be his best album so far. &quot;Looking for the Moon&quot; contains the song &quot;The Bravest&quot;, which is about the firefighters who gave their lives while trying to save others in New York City on September 11, 2001. Around this time, Paxton began writing and releasing his &quot;Short Shelf Life Songs&quot; about current events for free download on his website. Paxton wrote a number of topical protest songs that were critical of the Bush administration&#x27;s actions. In 2007, he rewrote a song of his from 1965 entitled &quot;Lyndon Johnson Told The Nation&quot;, about the escalation of the war in Vietnam, and transformed it into &quot;George W. Told The Nation&quot;, about the surge in the Iraq war. In 2007, Tom Paxton became one of the founding members of the Copyright Alliance, whose purpose is to promote the cultural and economic benefits of copyrights. 

In 2008, Paxton rewrote his song &quot;I&#x27;m Changing My Name to Chrysler&quot;, about the federal loan guarantee to Chrysler in 1979, as &quot;I Am Changing My Name to Fannie Mae&quot;, about the 700 billion dollar &quot;bailout of the U.S. financial system&quot;. He continues to perform yearly tours of the United States and UK. 

In March 2015, Paxton released the studio album &quot;Redemption Road&quot;. In January 2017, Paxton released &quot;Boat in the Water&quot;, his sixty-third album.

Paxton is now in &quot;semi-retirement&quot;, though he still performs occasional shows and did a ten-venue UK tour in 2017.

Paxton toured the UK in 2018 and 2019 (11 venues), accompanied by The Don Juans. His shows featured his 2011 song &quot;What if, no matter&quot; (&quot;He couldn&#x27;t lay his hands on a gun&quot;).

Paxton has released several studio records in recent years, including &quot;Together&quot; in collaboration with John McCutcheon in 2023 and &quot;All New&quot; with Cathy Fink and Marcy Marxer. He has had a creative renaissance late in his career, co-writing multiple times a week with an array of artists including John McCutcheon, Jackson Emmer, and Buffalo Rose. Paxton and Buffalo Rose collaborated on a version of his song &quot;I Give You the Morning&quot; on their co-release &quot;Rabbit&quot; in 2022.

==Personal life and family==
Paxton was married to Margaret &quot;Midge&quot; Anne Cummings from 1963 until her death from a long illness in 2014. The couple have two daughters, Jennifer and Kate, and three grandsons. Jennifer is a history professor who has published courses for The Teaching Company. 

Over the years, the Paxtons traveled extensively as Midge supported her husband&#x27;s performing career and they took part in civil rights and antiwar demonstrations. They lived for two years in London, where Midge frequently performed before they returned to East Hampton, New York every summer and were part of a large network of friends who shared music interests, cookouts and holiday celebrations. After spending a few summers in Amagansett, the Paxtons finally moved to East Hampton in 1967, buying a house on Egypt Close the following year, where Midge said she was particularly proud of her work in the early movement of women’s rights movement.

Paxton has described his political views in the following way: &quot;My own politics more or less resembled Will Rogers&#x27;s politics. He had said that he belonged to no organized political party — he was a Democrat ... being young and impassioned almost automatically put me over on the radical side of most issues. Being older, I find myself still more or less there, somewhat to my surprise.&quot;

==Awards, honors, and nominations==

In February 2002, Paxton was honored with the ASCAP Lifetime Achievement Award in Folk Music. A few days later, he received three Wammies (Washington, DC, Area Music Awards); as Best Male Vocalist in the &quot;traditional folk&quot; and &quot;children&#x27;s music&quot; categories, and for Best Traditional Folk Recording of the Year for &quot;Under American Skies&quot; (2001). 

Paxton has been nominated four times for Grammy Awards, all since 2002. He was first nominated in 2002 for his children&#x27;s album, &quot;Your Shoes, My Shoes&quot;. The following year, &quot;Looking for the Moon&quot; received a 2003 nomination for &quot;Best Contemporary Folk Album&quot;. &quot;Live in the UK&quot; (2005), received a 2006 Grammy nomination in the &quot;Best Traditional Folk Album&quot; category. Most recently, his 2008 album &quot;Comedians and Angels&quot; received a 2009 nomination, also in the &quot;Best Traditional Folk Album&quot; category. Paxton was honored with a 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Recording Academy, and the formal announcement was made during the 51st Annual Grammy Awards telecast, which aired on February 8, 2009.

In 2004, the Martin Guitar Company introduced the HD-40LSH Tom Paxton Signature Edition acoustic guitar in his honor. In 2005, Paxton received a Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting at BBC Radio 2&#x27;s Folk Awards at London&#x27;s Brewery Arts Centre. In 2006, Paxton received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the North American Folk Music and Dance Alliance. On January 22, 2007, Paxton was honored with an official Parliamentary tribute at the House of Commons of the United Kingdom at the start of his 2007 UK tour. On May 3, 2008, Paxton was honored with a special lifetime tribute from the World Folk Music Association, and a concert was held at the Rachel M. Schlesinger Concert Hall and Arts Center at Northern Virginia Community College, Alexandria Campus, in Alexandria, Virginia.

<text>The United States National Agricultural Library (NAL) is one of the world&#x27;s largest agricultural research libraries, and serves as a national library of the United States and as the library of the United States Department of Agriculture. Located in Beltsville, Maryland, it is one of five national libraries of the United States (along with the Library of Congress, the National Library of Medicine, the National Transportation Library, and the National Library of Education). It is also the coordinator for the Agriculture Network Information Center (AgNIC), a national network of state land-grant institutions and coordinator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) field libraries.

NAL was established on May 15, 1862, by the signing of the Organic Act by Abraham Lincoln. It served as a departmental library until 1962, when the Secretary of Agriculture officially designated it as the National Agricultural Library. The first librarian, appointed in 1867, was Aaron B. Grosh, one of the founders of the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry.

==History==


NAL was established as the U.S. Department of Agriculture Library on May 15, 1862, by the signing of the Organic Act by Abraham Lincoln. In 1863, the library&#x27;s collection comprised 1,000 volumes that had been transferred from the U.S. Patent Office&#x27;s Agricultural Division. By 1889, the library&#x27;s collection had increased to 20,000 volumes, and a librarian from Amherst College was hired to create a classification system for the library&#x27;s collection. At this time, the library was located on the second floor of the Department of Agriculture&#x27;s main building. In 1893, William Cutter was hired as Librarian of the Department, and he began a reorganization effort to modernize the library and improve its effectiveness. His primary achievement was consolidating the library&#x27;s collection of 38,000 volumes into one central library; previously, more than half of the library&#x27;s collection was held in divisional libraries across the United States. By 1900, the library&#x27;s collection contained 68,000 volumes, and in 1915, the library was moved to a larger facility in the Bieber Office Building at 1358 B Street SW, Washington, DC. The library moved again in 1932 to facilities in the USDA&#x27;s South Building on Independence Avenue.

In 1934, the collection reached 250,000 volumes in size, and the library began participating in the Bibliofilm Service, which, along with the American Documentation Institute and the Science Service, supplied microfilm copies of articles to scientists. This was the first large-scale attempt by a library to provide copies of library materials to patrons rather than the original documents, and during its first year, over 300,000 copies were distributed.

During World War II, the Department of Agriculture underwent reorganization to address wartime needs. The library, which had been decentralized since 1920, was consolidated into a central facility under the direction of Department Librarian Ralph R. Shaw.

On May 23, 1962, the 100th anniversary of the library&#x27;s establishment, Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman officially designated the library as the National Agricultural Library, making it the third national library in the United States. In 1964, funds were appropriated by Congress to begin planning for a new library facility in Beltsville, Maryland, on the grounds of the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. Construction on the new facility began in 1965, and it first opened in 1969. In 2000, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman designated the building as the Abraham Lincoln Building.

==Facilities==
The main library is housed in the Abraham Lincoln Building, a seventeen-story facility on the grounds of the Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland. NAL also used to operate a Washington, D.C., branch known as the DC Reference Center, which was located in the USDA&#x27;s South Building.

===Paul L. Byrne Agricultural Teaching and Research Center===
The Paul L. Byrne Agricultural Teaching and Research Center is located at California State University, Chico and is part of the 800-acre Paul L. Byrne Memorial University Farm.

==Services==
===PubAg===
PubAg is search engine that gives the public enhanced access to research published by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists, and also to agriculturally relevant citations from the scientific literature. At its launch on January 13, 2015, PubAg made over 40,000 publications by USDA scientists available, and provided access to an additional 300,000 citations.

===Ag Data Commons===
Ag Data Commons is a repository and catalog for scientific datasets that are associated with publications by the USDA&#x27;s agricultural research service and other institutions. The data included is funded by the USDA, either in whole or in part.

===LCA Commons===
Hosted by the National Agricultural Library, the U.S. Life Cycle Assessment Commons (LCA Commons) is a collaboration among federal agencies, private industry, and academic researchers. The intention of LCA Commons is to aggregate and archive life cycle inventory data that represent US economic activities, making it freely available for re-use. It is geared for use in LCAs, supporting policy assessment, decision-making in technology implementation, and public disclosure of comparative product or technology assertions.

===i5K Workspace @ NAL ===
The i5k Workspace@NAL provides genome projects resulting from the i5k initiative with a space to display and share genome assemblies and gene models. In particular, the Workspace is geared towards research groups that do not have the resources to display the genome assembly and its features.

===AGRICOLA===

NAL maintains AGRICOLA (AGRICultural OnLine Access), the largest bibliographic database of agricultural literature in the world. It contains more than 4.1 million records for publications dating as far back as the 15th century. 78 percent of the records are for journal articles and book chapters, while 22 percent cover full-length books, journals, maps, electronic resources, and audiovisual materials. The database indexes publications from many disciplines related to agriculture, including veterinary sciences, entomology, forestry, aquaculture and fisheries, economics, food and human nutrition, and environmental sciences.

AGRICOLA originated in 1942 as the &quot;Bibliography of Agriculture&quot;, a printed index of article citation records. It was first digitized in 1970, when records were placed on magnetic tapes rather than reproducing them manually. The name was changed to AGRICOLA at this time, and the records were made available through database vendors such as Dialog and OCLC. In 1998, it became available to the general public for free on the World Wide Web.

===National Agricultural Library Special Collections===
The library&#x27;s Special Collections houses rare materials related to the history of agriculture, including books, manuscripts, paintings and drawings, seed catalogs, agricultural photographs, and posters from the 1500s to the present. The subjects covered include horticulture, entomology, poultry sciences, and natural history.

====Pomological Watercolor Collection====

Within the Special Collections, the Pomological Watercolor Collection holds over 7,500 original watercolors on botanical subjects created by USDA artists between 1886 and 1942, almost half of which are apples. It is a unique resource documenting new introductions of fruit and nut cultivars as well as specimens discovered by USDA&#x27;s plant explorers, representing 38 plant families in all. Some of these watercolors were published in the &quot;Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture&quot; in the 1902–1913 period, but many were never published at all.

Some 65 different artists are represented in the collection, of whom one-third were women. Just 9 of the 65 are responsible for more than 90% of the total: Deborah Griscom Passmore (over 1500 watercolors), Amanda Newton (over 1200), Mary Daisy Arnold, (over 1000), Royal Charles Steadman (over 850), J. Marion Shull (over 750), Ellen Isham Schutt (over 700), Bertha Heiges (over 600), Elsie E. Lower (over 250), and William Henry Prestele (over 100). Many of the pictures in the Pomological Watercolor Collection are available online through the library&#x27;s Digital Repository (see link below).

===National Agricultural Library Digital Repository===
The NAL Digital Repository, created in April 2006, serves as a digital archive of historical USDA documents. The repository contains over 600,000 pages of digitized texts. Publications contained in the repository include the issues of the &quot;Journal of Agricultural Research&quot; from 1913–1949 and the archives of the &quot;Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture&quot; dating back to 1894.

===Information Centers===
NAL also houses several specialized information centers, which provide access to comprehensive and essential information resources focusing on the specific aspects of agricultural subjects. In addition to the general reference services available at NAL, each center offers Internet access to resources enhancing information availability and dissemination. The centers have staff available to serve customers on-site as well as by phone, fax or email. The Information Centers at the National Agricultural Library include:

*Alternative Farming Systems Information Center
*Animal Welfare Information Center
*Food and Nutrition Information Center
**Nutrition.gov 
*Food Safety Research Information Office Center 
*National Invasive Species Information Center
*Rural Information Center
*Water and Agriculture Information Center

==== Animal Welfare Information Center ====
The Animal Welfare Information Center (AWIC) is a centralized resource of information products, services, and activities that provide information on animal welfare in research, teaching, testing, and exhibition as specified by the Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals Act of 1985. The 1985 Act was an amendment to the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (AWA), and mandated an information service at the NAL to provide information on employee training, preventing duplication of animal experiments, and improving animal experimentation methods by reducing or replacing animal use and minimizing animals&#x27; pain and distress. The center later became known as AWIC in 1986.

The AWIC provides educational outreach through its website, free in-person and virtual workshops and trainings, the USDA NAL Twitter feed, and monthly newsletters. Outreach topics focus on the AWA and its amendments, the Three Rs principles (reduction, replacement, and refinement of animal use), and alternatives literature searching. This information is available to the public, but is specifically targeted towards scientists, veterinarians, animal care staff, librarians, and students. AWIC also provides free literature searching services upon request.

AWIC supports the research community by assisting with their alternatives literature search, which is one way it meets the AWA requirement to consider alternatives. Scientists working with animals are required to provide their institution&#x27;s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) with documentation demonstrating that alternatives to painful or distressful procedures were considered and that experiments are not unnecessarily duplicative. These literature searches help identify 3Rs alternative methods to and within animal experimentation.

==== Food Safety Research Information Office Center ====
The Food Safety Research Information Office (FSRIO) collects, organizes, and disseminates food safety information in accordance with the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. The Act mandated that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) establish an office to collect and maintain information on food safety studies to prevent duplicative research projects and to assist the government and private research organizations in determining research priorities. The National Agricultural Library formally launched the office on July 2, 2001.

FSRIO&#x27;s mission also includes disseminating information to the general public on publicly funded (including university investigations) and, as much as possible, privately funded research initiatives. The office assists the Federal Government and private research entities with assessing food safety research needs; while also supporting the research community through organizing, collecting, and disseminating food safety research information. FSRIO also makes food safety investigations conducted through the Agricultural Research Service and from across other U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies available to researchers as well as projects from the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health.

FSRIO maintains a searchable database on more than 1,700 food safety research products dating from 1996 to the present. The collection is indexed using the National Agricultural Library Thesaurus (NALT). The Thesaurus and its glossary are online vocabulary tools of agricultural and related terms in English and Spanish cooperatively produced through NAL, USDA, the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture, and other Latin American agricultural institutions in the Agriculture Information and Documentation Service of the Americas (SIDALC). In 2016, FSRIO created a repository of &quot;Meet the Expert&quot; videos that include content from a variety of sources. The videos highlight the latest food safety research applications conducted at USDA and other federal agencies.

==== Food and Nutrition Information Center ====
In 1971, the Food and Nutrition Information Center (FNIC) was established as a national repository of training and educational materials for the staff of USDA&#x27;s Child Nutrition Programs (e.g. school lunch programs). The Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 furthered the mission of FNIC also to be a resource for state education agencies and interested members of the general public. FNIC covers topics related to dietary guidelines and supplements, and food composition. It also maintains a database of extensive food, nutrition, and related topics and resource lists. Currently, the FNIC website contains links to over 2,500 current and reliable resources on nutrition and is regularly updated by a staff of registered dietitians.

FNIC offers a Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) (established Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine) calculator for daily nutrient recommendations, healthy recipes, educational materials, professional resources, food labeling information, and consumer food safety information, among other resources. In 2019, FNIC expanded their Spanish language website, &quot;En Español” which offers over forty web pages translated into Spanish. With the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, FNIC expanded the site to offer a recipe page with recipes from both Federal and Cooperative Extension sites; the recipe library is updated regularly.

==== Nutrition.gov ====
Nutrition.gov is a USDA-sponsored website created and maintained by the Food and Nutrition Information Center. The website receives content guidance from a USDA working group of scientific experts in food and nutrition and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Launched in 2004, Nutrition.gov is a part of the USDA&#x27;s Obesity Intervention Plan and is funded by the Research, Education and Economics (REE) mission area of USDA. Nutrition.gov provides consumers with access to up-to-date, reliable information about food, healthy eating, food safety, and physical activity.

<doc id="1263748" wikidata="Q525997" url="?curid=1263748" title="Treaty of Georgievsk">
<text>The Treaty of Georgievsk (; ) was a bilateral treaty concluded between the Russian Empire and the east Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti on July 24, 1783. The treaty established eastern Georgia as a protectorate of Russia, which guaranteed its territorial integrity and the continuation of its reigning Bagrationi dynasty in return for prerogatives in the conduct of Georgian foreign affairs. By this, eastern Georgia abjured any form of dependence on Persia (who had been its suzerain for centuries) or another power, and every new Georgian monarch of Kartli-Kakheti would require the confirmation and investiture of the Russian tsar.

==Terms==
Under articles I, II, IV, VI, and VII of the treaty&#x27;s terms, Russia&#x27;s empress became the official and sole suzerain of Kartli-Kakheti&#x27;s rulers, guaranteeing the Georgians’ internal sovereignty and territorial integrity, and promising to &quot;regard their enemies as Her enemies&quot; 
Each of the Georgian kingdom&#x27;s tsars would henceforth be obliged to swear allegiance to Russia&#x27;s emperors, to support Russia in war, and to have no diplomatic communications with other nations without Russia&#x27;s prior consent.

Given Georgia&#x27;s history of invasions from the south, an alliance with Russia may have been seen as the only way to discourage or resist Persian and Ottoman aggression, while also establishing a link to Western Europe. In the past, Georgian rulers had not only accepted formal domination by Turkish and Persian emperors, but had also often converted to Islam, and sojourned at their capitals. Thus it was neither a break with Georgian tradition nor a unique capitulation of independence for Kartli-Kakheti to trade vassalage for peace with a powerful neighbor. Though Orthodox Christian, Russia was otherwise culturally alien, in the treaty&#x27;s preamble and article VIII the bond of Orthodox Christianity between Georgians and Russians was acknowledged, which tied the two, and Georgia&#x27;s primate, the Catholicos, became Russia&#x27;s eighth permanent archbishop and a member of Russia&#x27;s Holy Synod.

Other treaty provisions included mutual guarantees of an open border between the two realms for travelers, emigrants and merchants (articles 10, 11), while Russia undertook &quot;to leave the power for internal administration, law and order, and the collection of taxes [under the] complete will and use of His Serene Highness the Tsar, forbidding [Her Majesty’s] Military and Civil Authorities to intervene in any [domestic laws or commands]&quot;.
(article VI). Article III created an investiture ceremony whereby the Georgian kings of Kartli-Kakheti, upon swearing fealty to Russia&#x27;s emperors, would receive the royal regalia.

The treaty was negotiated on behalf of Russia by Lieutenant-General Pavel Potemkin, commander of Russia&#x27;s troops in Astrakhan and a delegate and cousin of General Prince Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin, who was the official Russian plenipotentiary. Kartli-Kakheti&#x27;s official delegation consisted of a Kartlian and a Kakhetian, both of high rank: Ioane, Prince of Mukhrani, (referred to in the Russian version of the treaty as &quot;Prince Ivan Konstantinovich Bagration&quot;), Constable of the Left-Hand Army and son-in-law of the Georgian king, and Adjutant-General Garsevan Chavchavadze, Governor of Kazakhi (&quot;aka&quot; Prince Garsevan Revazovich Chavchavadze, member of a Kakhetian princely family of the third rank, vassals of the Abashidze princes). These emissaries officially signed the treaty at the fortress of Georgievsk in the North Caucasus on July 24, 1783. The Georgian King Erekle II and the Empress Catherine the Great then formally ratified it in 1784.

==Aftermath==

The results of the Treaty of Georgievsk proved disappointing for the Georgians. King Erekle&#x27;s adherence to it prompted Persia&#x27;s new ruler, Agha Mohammad Khan, who had sent several ultimatums, to invade, as he sought to re-establish Persia&#x27;s traditional suzerainty over the region. Russia did nothing to help the Georgians during the disastrous Battle of Krtsanisi in 1795, which left Tbilisi sacked and Georgia ravaged (including the west Georgian kingdom of Imereti, ruled by Erekle II&#x27;s grandson, King Solomon II). Belatedly, Catherine declared war on Persia and sent an army to Transcaucasia. But her death shortly thereafter (November 1796) put an end to Russia&#x27;s Persian Expedition of 1796, as her successor, Paul, turned to other strategic objectives. Persia&#x27;s Shahanshah next contemplated the removal of the Christian population from eastern Georgia and eastern Armenia, launching the campaign from Karabagh. His goal was frustrated not by Russian resistance, but by a Persian assassin in 1797.

On January 14, 1798, King Erekle II was succeeded on the throne by his eldest son, George XII (1746–1800) who, on February 22, 1799, recognized his own eldest son, Tsarevich David (&quot;Davit Bagrationi-batonishvili&quot;), 1767–1819, as official heir apparent. In the same year Russian troops were stationed in Kartli-Kakheti. Pursuant to article VI of the treaty, Emperor Paul confirmed David&#x27;s claim to reign as the next king on April 18, 1799. But strife broke out among King George&#x27;s many sons and those of his late father over the throne, Erekle II having changed the succession order at the behest of his third wife, Queen Darejan Dadiani, to favor the accession of younger brothers of future kings over their own sons. The resulting dynastic upheaval prompted King George to secretly invite Paul I to invade Kartli-Kakheti, to subdue the Bagratid princes, and to govern the kingdom from St. Petersburg, on the condition that George and his descendants be allowed to continue to reign nominally – in effect, offering to mediatize the Bagratid dynasty under the Romanov emperors. Continued pressure from Persia, also prompted George XII&#x27;s request for Russian intervention.

Paul tentatively accepted this offer, but before negotiations could be finalized changed his mind and issued a decree on December 18, 1800 annexing Kartli-Kakheti to Russia and deposing the Bagratids. Paul himself died shortly thereafter. It is said that his successor, Emperor Alexander I, considered retracting the annexation in favor of a Bagratid heir, but being unable to identify one likely to retain the crown, on September 12, 1801 Alexander proceeded to confirm annexation. Meanwhile, King George had died on December 28, 1800, before learning that he had lost his throne. By the following April, Russian troops took control of the country&#x27;s administration and in February 1803 Tsarevich David Bagrationi was escorted by Russian troops from Tbilisi to St. Petersburg. He was pensioned, joined the Russian Senate, and retained his royal style until May 6, 1833 when he was demoted from &quot;tsarevich&quot; (the Russian equivalent of &quot;batonishvili&quot;) to &quot;prince&quot; (&quot;knyaz&quot;), along with other members of the deposed dynasty, following an abortive uprising in Georgia led by David&#x27;s uncle, Prince Alexandre Bagrationi. 

The Russians then ended the Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813 with a victory. By the Treaty of Gulistan (1813), Qajar Persia was forced to officially cede eastern Georgia to the Russian Empire.

Paul&#x27;s annexation of east Georgia and exile of the Bagratids remain controversial: Soviet historians would later maintain that the treaty was an act of &quot;brotherhood of the Russian and Georgian peoples&quot; that justified annexation to protect Georgia both from its historical foreign persecutors and its &quot;decadent&quot; native dynasty. Nonetheless, no bilateral amendment had been ratified altering article VI sections 2 and 3 of the 1784 treaty, which obligated the Russian emperor &quot;to preserve His Serene Highness Tsar Irakli Teimurazovich and the Heirs and descendants to his House, uninterrupted on the Throne of the Kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti...forbidding [Her Majesty’s] Military and Civil Authorities to intervene in any [domestic laws or commands].&quot;

==Legacy==

Ironically, that clause of the treaty would also be recalled during obscure late 20th century debates about restoration of the Russian monarchy. In 1948, Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov, (1917–1992), pretender to Russia&#x27;s throne, married Princess Leonida Georgievna Bagration-Moukhranskaya, (born 1914), a descendant of the &quot;Mukhranbatoni&quot; who negotiated the 1783 treaty, and thus a member of the once royal House of Bagrationi. The marriage produced an only child, Maria Vladimirovna, (born 1956), who has taken up her father&#x27;s claim as Russia&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; monarch. She and her son, George (born of her former marriage to Prince Franz Wilhelm of Prussia), have pretended to the Romanovs’ old grand ducal title. Her supporters argue that her father&#x27;s marriage to Leonida, alone among those contracted by Romanov males in exile since 1917, complied with the Romanov house law that required marriage to a princess of a &quot;royal or ruling family&quot; in order for descendants to claim the throne. That law also provided that upon extinction of all male dynasts, female Romanovs born of dynastic mothers become eligible to inherit the crown. Based on this rationale, Maria purports to have the strongest legal claim to the Russian throne in the event that Russia ever restores its monarchy.

Critics deny that Princess Leonida could be reckoned of royal rank by Romanov standards (the title of &quot;prince&quot; was one of nobility, not dynasty in Russia, except in the imperial family). They point out that the Bagration-Mukhranskys were demoted from dynastic status and incorporated into Russia&#x27;s ordinary nobility by 1833: Though the princess descended patrilineally from a dynasty that had ruled as kings in Armenia and Georgia since the Middle Ages, it had been reduced to the status of Russian nobility for over a century prior to the Russian Revolution. Leonida&#x27;s branch of the Bagratids, although genealogically senior, had not been regnant in the male line as kings of Georgia since 1505. Members of the family accepted court appointments under Russia&#x27;s emperors incompatible with claims to dynastic dignity. Moreover, when an imperial Romanov princess wed Prince Constantine Bagration-Mukhransky in 1911, the marriage was officially deemed non-dynastic by Nicholas II, and the bride, Tatiana Konstantinova Romanova, was obliged to renounce her succession rights.

While these facts are admitted, it is counter-argued that the demotion of the Bagratids, including the Mukhrani branch, violated the &quot;Treaty of Georgievsk&quot; and therefore failed to legally deprive any Bagrationi of royal rank. That fact, it is claimed, distinguishes Leonida from princesses of other once-sovereign families of the Russian Empire who married Romanovs. Nonetheless, it was the agnatic seniority of the &quot;Mukhranbatoni&quot;’s descent from Georgia’s former kings, rather than the broken treaty, that Vladimir Kirilovich cited in a 1946 decree recognizing the Bagration-Mukhranskys as dynastic for marital purposes, presumably so as to avoid the Russian Empire&#x27;s annexation of Georgia.

The language of article VI guaranteed the Georgian throne not only to King Erekle II and his direct issue, but also embraced &quot;the Heirs and descendants to his House&quot;. On the other hand, article IX offered to extend no more than &quot;the same privileges and advantages granted to the Russian nobility&quot; to Georgia&#x27;s princes and nobles. Yet first on the list of families submitted to Russia to enjoy noble (&quot;not&quot; royal) status was that of the &quot;Mukhranbatoni&quot;. That list included twenty-one other princely families and a larger number of untitled nobles, most of whom were enrolled in Russia&#x27;s nobility during the 19th century. The claims made on Maria&#x27;s behalf have long embittered Romanov descendants who belong to the Romanov Family Association. Many of them descend matrilineally from noble Russian princesses, some of whose families were also of &quot;dynastic&quot; origin, but cannot claim that a Treaty of Georgievsk has &quot;preserved&quot; their &quot;dynasticity&quot;.

In 1983, the Soviet authorities celebrated the bicentennial of the Treaty of Georgievsk, provoking protests from anti-Soviet Georgian dissidents. In this period, several monuments were erected to commemorate the treaty, among them the Russia–Georgia Friendship Monument along the Georgian Military Road. Georgia&#x27;s underground Samizdat publication, &quot;Sakartvelo&quot; (საქართველო), dedicated a special issue to the event, emphasizing imperial Russia&#x27;s disregard of the key agreements in the treaty. Underground political groups disseminated leaflets calling on Georgians to boycott the celebrations, and several young Georgian activists were arrested by the Soviet police.

<text>Krzysztof Wodiczko (born April 16, 1943) is a Polish artist known for his large-scale slide and video projections on architectural facades and monuments. He has realized more than 80 such public projections in Australia, Austria, Canada, England, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States.

War, conflict, trauma, memory, and communication in the public sphere are some of the major themes of his work. His practice, known as Interrogative Design, combines art and technology as a critical design practice in order to highlight marginal social communities and add legitimacy to cultural issues that are often given little design attention.

He lives and works in New York City and teaches in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he is currently professor in residence of art and the public domain for the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD). Wodiczko was formerly director of the Interrogative Design Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he was a professor in the Visual Arts Program since 1991. He also teaches as visiting professor in the Psychology Department at the Warsaw School of Social Psychology.

==Early life==
Wodiczko, son of Polish orchestra conductor Bohdan Wodiczko, as well having a Jewish mother, was born in 1943 during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and grew up in post-war communist Poland. In 1967 while still a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, he began collaborating with director Jozef Patkowski and the Experimental Studio on sound performances. He graduated in 1968 with an M.F.A. degree in industrial design and worked for the next two years at UNITRA, Warsaw, designing popular electronic products. From 1970 until his emigration to Canada in 1977, he designed professional optical, mechanical, and electronic instruments at the Polish Optical Works.

In 1969, Wodiczko collaborated with Andrzej Dluzniewski and Wojciech Wybieralski on a design proposal for a memorial to victims of Majdanek concentration camp in Poland. He also performed with &quot;Personal Instrument&quot; in the streets of Warsaw and participated in the &quot;Biennale de Paris&quot; as a leader of a group architectural project. He was a teaching assistant for two years, 1969–70, in the Basic Design Program at the Academy of Fine Arts before moving to the Warsaw Polytechnic Institute, where he taught until 1976. Throughout the 1970s he continued his collaborations on sound and music performances with various musicians and artists.

In 1971, Wodiczko began work on &quot;Vehicle&quot;, which he tested the following year on the streets of Warsaw. In 1972 he created his first solo installation: Corridor at Galeria Wspolczesna, Warsaw. The following year he began exhibiting with Galeria Foksal, Warsaw. In 1975, Wodiczko traveled for the first time to the United States where he was artist-in-residence at the University of Illinois, Urbana and exhibited at N.A.M.E. Gallery, Chicago. He participated again in the &quot;Biennale de Paris&quot;, this time as a solo artist.

In 1976, Wodiczko began a two-year artist-in-residence program at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. He emigrated from Poland in 1977, establishing residency in Canada teaching at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and began working with New York art dealer Hal Bromm, at whose Tribeca gallery Wodiczko&#x27;s first US exhibition was presented in 1977. In 1979 he taught at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto and continued teaching at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design until 1981. From 1981 to 1982 he was artist in residence at the South Australian School of Art (currently part of the University of South Australia in Adelaide). In 1983, Wodiczko established residency in New York City teaching at the New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury. The following year, he received Canadian citizenship and in 1986 resident-alien status in the United States. He began teaching at MIT in 1991, maintaining his residence in New York City while working in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

== Work ==

===Projections===
Wodiczko began developing his public projections in 1980 interfacing the facades of urban architecture – whether public monuments, public buildings, or corporate architecture – with images of the body to juxtapose the physical space of architecture with the psycho-social space of the public realm. &quot;In the process of our socialization,&quot; the artist writes, &quot;the very first contact with a public building is no less important than the moment of social confrontation with the father, through which our sexual role and place in society [are] constructed. Early socialization through patriarchal sexual discipline is extended by the later socialization through the institutional architecturalization of our bodies. Thus the spirit of the father never dies, continuously living as it does in the building which was, is, and will be embodying, structuring, mastering, representing, and reproducing his &#x27;eternal&#x27; and &#x27;universal&#x27; presence as a patriarchal wisdom-body of power.&quot;

In an often cited example, during his October 1984 exhibition at Hal Bromm Gallery, &quot;Krzysztof Wodiczko: Completing Facades,&quot; Wodiczko projected an image of the hand of Ronald Reagan, in formal dress shirt with cufflinks, posed in the pledge of allegiance, onto the north face of the AT&amp;T Long Lines Building in the Tribeca district of New York City four days before the presidential election of 1984. &quot;By creating a spectacle in which a fragment of the governing body, the presidential hand, was asked to stand for corporate business,&quot; writes Ewa Lajer-Burcharth, &quot;Wodiczko offered a suggestion about the class identity of those forces that – hidden under the guise of God, State, and Nation – are the actual receivers of the pledge of allegiance.&quot; During the gallery exhibition, a second projection took place on the Washington Square Arch on lower Fifth Avenue. In subsequent projections, the artist layered iconic representations of global capitalism, militarism, and consumerism with images of fragments of the body to suggest a consideration of our relation to public space that is contingent both to history and social and political ideologies of the present.

Art historian Patricia C. Phillips writes of the artist&#x27;s work: &quot;In his public projects of the past decade, Wodiczko has conducted a series of active mediations that combine significant public sites, tough subjects, and aggressive statements that are only possible because of their temporality. He applies the immediate force of performance to social and political problems. The rhythms of extenuating events and the brevity of each installation give his projected episodes the intensity of public, political demonstrations. His thoroughly staged, illuminated images often require months of preparation, yet they seem like surprise attacks – fiercely focused parasitic invasions of renowned institutional hosts.&quot;

Perhaps the best-known and most popular intervention of this nature was performed when the artist created a projection for Nelson&#x27;s column in Trafalgar Square, London in 1985. The South African government was at that time petitioning the British government for financial support. Wodiczko turned one of his projectors away from Nelson&#x27;s column projecting a swastika onto the tympanum of the temple-like façade of South Africa House, the South African diplomatic mission to the United Kingdom. Though the image remained only two hours before the police suspended the intervention as a &quot;public nuisance&quot; it lingered in public awareness much longer. It is frequently cited at conferences, in classroom discussions, and other forum as an example of successful urban guerrilla cultural tactics – that is, art and/or performance that is waged by unexpected means for the purpose of engaging an active response.

 In explaining the potential of cultural projects in the public sphere, the artist writes: &quot;I try to understand what is happening in the city, how the city can operate as a communicative environment… It is important to understand the circumstances under which communication is reduced or destroyed, and under what possible new conditions it can be provoked to reappear. How can aesthetic practice in the built environment contribute to critical discourse between the inhabitants themselves and the environment? How can aesthetic practice make existing symbolic structures respond to contemporary events?&quot; For Wodiczko, disrupting the complacency of perception is imperative for passersby to stop, reflect, and perhaps even change their thinking; so he built his visual repertoire to evoke both the historical past and the political present.

In this way, Wodiczko&#x27;s visual repertoire for his projections expanded beyond the body (ears, eyes, and hands as indicators of human sensibility) to include chains, missiles, tanks, coins, cameras, boots, swastikas, guns, candles, food baskets, and corporate logos. &quot;In these projections,&quot; writes Kathleen MacQueen, &quot;the artist alternates between symbolic, iconic, and indexical images – the principal relations an image can have to its subject, according to the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce – that is, predicated on a cultural reference, a physical resemblance, or a physical relation respectively. In many instances they scramble all relations: the hand, an index of the body – someone&#x27;s body – is also an iconic representation of communication that might symbolically represent an open or closed ideological position.&quot; The reductive, visual signs monumentally-sized to fit the facades on which they are projected, are not meant to read as logos for a political agenda, instead they suggest a perceptual contradiction to disrupt the kind of assumptions that beset the casual passerby.

Wodiczko&#x27;s visual interventions into public space are intended to alter what Jacques Rancière would later term the &quot;realm of the sensible&quot;. When the public views its urban monuments with sidelong glances out of the corners of its eyes, it accepts the monuments as natural and uncoded. By intercepting vision with projections, Wodiczko replaces an unconsidered reception with a critical one. This is the lesson of the Russian Formalists, of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s Verfremdungseffekt and of Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s understanding of Goethe&#x27;s belief that knowledge must quicken activity rather than lead to complacence.

The artist began to integrate direct activism into his projects in the late 1980s with his vehicles and his instruments, articles of design that would act as band-aids – not only healing social wounds but perhaps more importantly calling attention to them.

===Vehicles===

As homelessness reached over 100,000 in late 1980, Wodiczko used the ‘homeless vehicle’ as a source of discussion and discourse. While the artist had produced his first vehicle in Poland with additional conceptual versions designed when he lived in Canada, it was with his &quot;Homeless Vehicle Project&quot; of 1987–89, that he redirected &quot;attention from the work of art as dissent to the work of art as social action: in this case, the discussions and design collaboration with members of the homeless community to develop both a physical object and a conceptual design that would make their participation in the urban economy visible and self-directed.&quot; Wodiczko&#x27;s cart consisted of “a storage area for personal belongings, a washbasin that doubled as support for a table, a bin to hold cans and bottles, and, beneath its roof, just enough space for a desperate homeless man to sleep” The cart was used in New York and Philadelphia. The art sparked outrage as people thought the cart took up too much space resulting in the audience reaction becoming part of the art itself. The &quot;Homeless Vehicle Project&quot; was both symbolic and useful: the artist&#x27;s first work to use a collective process to legitimize the problems of a marginal community &quot;without legitimating the crisis of homelessness.&quot; While the public was cautious, the operators of the vehicles took the project seriously. According to Wodiczko, &quot;You see this in certain gestures, certain ways of behaving, speaking, dialoguing, of building up stories, narratives: the homeless become actors, orators, workers, all things which they usually are not. The idea is to let them speak and tell their own stories, to let them be legitimate actors on the urban stage.&quot; The attention to testimony as a transformative process while still tentative in the &quot;Homeless Vehicle Project&quot; became a significant performative process in the artist&#x27;s &quot;Instruments&quot; and eventually part of his projections as well. Through this art piece, Wodiczko was able to amplify the issue of homelessness in a society that dehumanizes and strips homeless people of their voice.

Wodiczko created &quot;Poliscar&quot; in 1991 as a kind of &quot;command center&quot; for communication and community activism – a vehicle equipped with first-aid supplies, video and radio transmission equipment, and tools for everyday survival, it could support legal, medical, and social crisis aid, the mobile units ranging from three to ten miles from a base station. &quot;Poliscar&quot; was a technological design for the disenfranchised public of the &quot;polis&quot; or public sphere. Later Wodiczko would merge his vehicles with his projections when working with war veterans (see &quot;Recent Work&quot;).

Wodiczko created the &quot;Personal Instrument&quot; in 1969, his first conceptual design work taken into the public sphere. Though he had a degree in industrial design and created popular electronics for a Polish manufacturer, his design philosophy was influenced by Russian constructivism epitomized by the poet/artist Vladimir Mayakovsky&#x27;s statement, &quot;the streets our brushes, the squares our palettes.&quot; &quot;The Personal Instrument&quot; consisted of a microphone, worn on the forehead, which retrieved sound while photo-receivers in gloves isolated and filtered the sound through the movement of the hand, which was then perceived discriminately by the artist, perceptually confined by the sound-proof headphones. By emphasizing selective listening, vital (under authoritarian restrictions) to a Polish citizen&#x27;s survival, Wodiczko intimated the prevalence of censored speech, registering &quot;dissent of a system that fostered one-directional critical thinking – listening over speech.&quot;

After his work with the homeless community in New York City and Philadelphia, Wodiczko returned to the possibilities of smaller, personal instruments as conceptual and functional objects to offset the problems of communication for urban migrants. Initially based on the iconic staff of the wandering prophet, the &quot;Alien Staff&quot; (1992 and its variant, 1992/93) was designed to mediate conversation between aliens (the juridical term designating all immigrants whether of legal or illegal status) and the franchised population of an urban environment. The staff not only presented an object of curiosity to passersby, causing them to interrupt their pace long enough to ask questions, it also became a repository of narrative recording and objects both sacred or necessary (e.g., green cards or family mementoes) to the lives of the immigrants. Influenced by Julia Kristeva&#x27;s &quot;Strangers to Ourselves&quot; (1991), Wodiczko developed new equipment in 1993 that focused even more directly on democratic speech rights for the performative stranger. &quot;Mouthpiece&quot; (&quot;Porte-parole&quot;) was intended to act as a protective zone so that the immigrant could expand her narrative outward into a collective experience thereby pulling her out of isolation. The video technology, to be worn over the mouth, makes strange the familiar thereby creating a point of entry for passersby to enter into conversation with the immigrant. Between 1993 and 1997, thirteen culturally displaced persons used variants of the &quot;Mouthpiece&quot; in Paris, Malmö, Helsinki, Warsaw, Amsterdam, Trélazé, and Angers.

=== Xenology ===
In its earliest sense, the ancient Greek &quot;xeinos&quot; was the guest who received hospitality, as opposed to the &quot;xeinodokos&quot; or &quot;host&quot;, who welcomed strangers and provided them with hospitality. It is from this perspective, that of the immigrant, the stranger within a society, as opposed to that of society or the &quot;xeinodokos&quot; viewing the outsider, that Wodiczko employs the term xenology: &quot;Xenology is the art of refusal to be fused, an art of delimitization, deidentification, and disintegration&quot; (&quot;Xenology: Immigrant Instruments&quot;, exhibition statement distributed at the Galerie Lelong, New York, 1996). Wodiczko calls xenology &quot;a new, nomadic, and yet undeveloped form of understanding and expression&quot;. Like the Eleatic Stranger (Xenos) in Plato&#x27;s &quot;The Sophist&quot;, the vehicle of Wodiczko&#x27;s xenology is a &quot;nomadic Sophist&quot;, a &quot;practitioner of democracy&quot; who &quot;recreate[s] an agora or forum each time he or she wishes to speak or listen.&quot;

==Recent work==

While working on &quot;Porte-parole&quot; in Europe, Wodiczko received an invitation from the filmmaker Andrzej Wajda to participate in an urban festival in Kraków using for the first time powerful Barco NV video projectors. Working with the Women&#x27;s Center, he merged for the first time the testimonial work that had evolved from his work with instruments with the visual impact of his well-known large-scale public projections. Testimony of domestic abuse spoken from the City Hall Tower created shockwaves in an overwhelmingly Catholic culture of denial.

In this way, Wodiczko continued in his testimonial video projections to respond to the needs of urban society&#x27;s marginal citizens who frequently survive outside the usual boundaries of juridical and social resources. In 2001, he merged the means of his instruments with the purpose of the projections in his &quot;Tijuana Projection&quot; executed for &quot;InSite&quot; 2000. In this public intervention, women working in the &quot;maquiladora&quot; industry of Tijuana, Mexico wore media technology designed to project their faces onto El Centro Cultural as they spoke emotionally of incest, police abuse, and work place discrimination in real time. As participants, their &quot;parrhesiastic&quot; speech was courageously offered at great risk to themselves for the purpose of moral and political change. Through the video projections, Wodiczko continues to develop the potential for aesthetic practice to effect social change as part of a wider discourse on agonistic pluralism prompted by such influences as Chantal Mouffe and Ludwig Wittgenstein.

The role of art in understanding and confronting conflict becomes an increasingly significant aspect of both Wodiczko&#x27;s aesthetic and pedagogical practices. This is true in his continued work with immigrants and his recent work with war veterans in the &quot;Veteran Vehicle Project&quot; as well as his public lectures and teaching seminars worldwide including his seminar on &quot;Trauma, Conflict, and Art&quot; for the Warsaw School of Social Psychology. Recently, Wodiczko has also created projections for the interiors of cultural spaces as a metaphor for our psychological isolation from broader social and political experience. His 2005 exhibition at Galerie Lelong in New York City, &quot;If you see something…&quot;, his 2009 installation in the Polish Pavilion for the 53rd Venice Biennale, &quot;Guests,&quot; position the viewer in relation to the consequences of global capitalism and the conflict produced as a result of the inequitable distribution of resources and opportunities. Krzysztof Wodiczko believes in the necessity for intellectuals to participate actively in society forging, as critic Jan Avgikos points out, &quot;a commitment to resistance and truth-telling that, while often derided as outmoded or impossible, remains a basic human impulse.&quot;

===&quot;...Out of Here: The Veterans Project&quot;===
In 2009, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston exhibited &quot;…Out of Here: The Veterans Project.&quot; The multimedia installation, which ran from November 4, 2009, to March 28, 2010, filled a dark and empty museum gallery with recorded voices and explosions, along with flashes of light, simulating the experience of a mortar attack in Iraq. On three walls of the gallery, projectors cast two horizontal rows of windows, creating the illusion that viewers were inside a darkened warehouse. The eight-minute audio track started with the bustle of traffic and citizens in an Iraqi city, brought in children&#x27;s laughter, and subtly overlapped an excerpt from an Al Jazeera broadcast of President Obama speaking about the need to endure in Iraq. Listeners also noted an Islamic call to prayer, forebodingly drowned out by the approach of a helicopter. Without much warning, soldiers began yelling and shooting. When the gunfire ceased, a mother was heard wailing, and the episode ended in ominous silence (voices recorded for Out of Here belonged to a mixture of Iraqi-Americans, United States soldiers, and actors).

In the process of creating &quot;Out of Here,&quot; Wodiczko opted to expand the dictionary definition of veteran. Traditionally, the term is described as &quot;a person who has served in a military force.&quot; Wodiczko has redefined veteran to include anyone who has lived in an area where war was fought at the time they lived there, for example, residents of Iraq from 2003 to 2011, or residents of Germany, England, France, etc. during World War II. The Iraqi-born civilians (veterans, by the artist&#x27;s definition) who contributed to &quot;Out of Here,&quot; including the woman who lent her voice to the audio track, offered a perspective altogether different from those of the American military who had been in Iraq. This careful manipulation of the term foreshadows the artist&#x27;s choice to insert his own thoughts in &quot;Out of Here,&quot; in addition to culling the testimonies of soldiers and Iraqis. Having lived through World War II in Poland and served in the Polish military during the cold war, Wodiczko is not merely working with veterans; he is one. The artist fulfills both old and new definitions of the word veteran.

One year later, &quot;Out of Here&quot; was shown at Galerie Lelong in New York City. This second iteration contained an excerpt from a different speech by the President, and mentioned the end of the war and the gradual withdrawal of troops. Speaking on the changes, the artist commented, &quot;It made the work more up to date…but the irony is that this project didn&#x27;t have to change much.&quot; Wodiczko cited the locations, Boston and New York, as sufficient to garner different readings of the work. &quot;The works in Boston and New York have different publics. New York&#x27;s character and the [art] shows gave &quot;Out of Here&quot; a big international audience as opposed to the more local audience in Boston.&quot; Collectively, these narratives paint a picture of the individual veterans who told them, the larger picture of the Iraq War, and the more subtle clues to the war&#x27;s repercussions.

===&quot;Abraham Lincoln: War Veteran Projection&quot;===
For &quot;Abraham Lincoln: War Veteran Projection&quot;, presented by More Art, Wodiczko engaged with dozens of American war veterans and their family members to explore the traumatic consequences of war. The artist interviewed a total of fourteen participants, recording conversations about war experiences, the difficult return to civilian life, loss, and guilt. These interviews were then edited into a video that was projected on the statue of Abraham Lincoln In Union Square Park.

Beginning as touring bassist for Ministry&#x27;s 1986 &quot;Twitch&quot; tour, Barker collaborated with frontman Al Jourgensen and collectively released &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot; in 1988. Although many musicians briefly contributed to Ministry in the nearly two-decade period after Barker joined the band, he and Jourgensen were the only continuous members. The dynamics between these two different personalities came to shape Ministry&#x27;s sound, along with a number of side-projects which they were involved in together.

In 2003, Barker left the band a year after the release of their eighth album &quot;Animositisomina&quot;. The decision was made official after the death of his father. Despite being in Ministry for almost 18 years, Jourgensen did not do anything to spur his departure. &quot;Over the years we&#x27;ve had strained relations as well as good times, and the last tour was no different than any other tour. That means it was extremely difficult and very intense and lots of fun,&quot; Barker had said.

It is often believed that Jourgensen and Barker were close bandmates and the latter played a huge creative role in the band. Jourgensen rebuffed these claims saying that their relationship was more like an arranged marriage and &quot;acrimonious.&quot; He said that they were never friends but business partners. Since leaving Ministry, Barker has distanced himself from Jourgensen and the two have had almost nothing positive to say about their relationship in the band.

Barker was quoted in a 2011 interview that it was &quot;tough to watch&quot; the band&#x27;s &quot;Fix: The Ministry Movie&quot; documentary as he could no longer associate himself with the band. When asked in a 2015 interview if he would ever work with Jourgensen again, he replied, &quot;I&#x27;m fairly confident we will not work together. We have zero relationship now.&quot; When asked why he left Ministry, he replied he was no longer willing to put up with the stupidity and decided that it was enough.

Barker has since moved on to other things and in 2016, seems to have more or less made peace with Ministry. &quot;Of course, that was a very intense time and extremely rewarding. That was quite a while ago and I rarely think about it. I&#x27;m still fascinated with the heaviest, ugliest music and it&#x27;s now hard to find the time for those pursuits. I am not in direct contact with Al these days.&quot;

In 2018, Jourgensen reconciled with Barker after they both made appearances at screenings for the documentary &quot;Industrial Accident: The Story of Wax Trax! Records&quot;. Jourgensen has stated he is eager to collaborate with Barker very soon. In March 2024, it was announced that Barker would reunite with Jourgensen to write, perform, and produce what is quite possibly the final Ministry album.

=== Lead into Gold ===
Lead into Gold is Barker&#x27;s current solo project. 

In Summer of 2018 he released the full length album &quot;The Sun Behind The Sun&quot;, followed by a North America tour with OhGr (Nivek Ogre) and Omniflux (Mahsa Zargaran). 

In Spring of 2023 Barker released another full length album &quot;The Eternal Present&quot;, followed by a North America tour with Skinny Puppy. 

=== Post-Ministry ===
Since 2003, Barker has spent his time recording new material, producing such acts as I Love You But I&#x27;ve Chosen Darkness and collaborating with artists such as Stayte (on their 2007 &quot;Cognitive Dissonance (The Art of Lying To Yourself)&quot; EP). He joined U.S.S.A. with Duane Denison (Tomahawk, ex-The Jesus Lizard) as bassist. The first album from his solo project Flowering Blight, entitled &quot;The Perfect Pair&quot;, was released on November 19, 2008, via the official website.

In 2011, Barker remixed the Deadly Apples song &quot;Self Inflicted Oppression&quot; with samples from Ministry&#x27;s &quot;Psalm 69&quot;. The remix was featured on the soundtrack for the documentary film &quot;Fix: The Ministry Movie&quot;.

Barker released &quot;Fix This!!!&quot; on April 10, 2012. This album features guests such as Chris Connelly, Ogre, Taylor Momsen, Puscifer, Deadly Apples, Alexis Marshall, Joshua Bradford, and Devix Szell.

In 2015, Barker joined the touring lineup of rock supergroup Puscifer as their bassist.

Barker is also one of the founders of Malekko Heavy Industry Corporation, a manufacturer of synthesizer modules and guitar effect pedals.

<doc id="1263763" wikidata="Q2615347" url="?curid=1263763" title="Battle of Krtsanisi">
<text>The Battle of Krtsanisi (, ) was fought between the army of Qajar Iran (Persia) and the Georgian armies of the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti and Kingdom of Imereti at the place of Krtsanisi near Tbilisi, Georgia, from September 8 to September 11, 1795, as part of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar&#x27;s war in response to King Heraclius II of Georgia’s alliance with the Russian Empire. The battle resulted in the decisive defeat of the Georgians, capture, and complete destruction of their capital Tbilisi, as well as the temporary absorption of eastern Georgia into the Iranian empire.

Although the Russian Empire had officially declared in the Treaty of Georgievsk of 1783 that it would protect Heraclius&#x27;s kingdom against any Iranian attempts to re-subjugate Georgia, Russia did not intervene to protect its ally. Subsequently, in order to restore Russian prestige, Catherine the Great launched a punitive campaign against Iran in 1796, but it was soon recalled after Catherine&#x27;s death the same year. The reestablishment of Iranian rule over Georgia did not last long, for the shah was assassinated in 1797 in Shusha, and the Georgian king died the year after. With Georgia laying in ruins and the central authorities in Iran occupied with the question of succession, the way was opened for Georgia&#x27;s annexation by Russia several years later by Tsar Paul.

As Iran could not allow the cession of Transcaucasia and Dagestan, which had been integral parts of Iran for centuries, the Battle of Krtsanisi directly led to two bitter Russo-Persian wars in 1804–1813 and 1826–1828, in which Fath Ali Shah, Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s successor, unsuccessfully attempted to reverse Russian military advances and restore Iranian authority north of the Aras and Kura rivers. After these wars, Iran ceded Transcaucasia and Dagestan to imperial Russia per the Treaty of Gulistan (1813) and the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828).

== Background ==
Eastern Georgia, composed of the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti, had been in the early modern era under Iranian suzerainty since the 1510s. In 1744, Nader Shah had granted the kingship of Kartli and Kakheti to Teimuraz II and his son Heraclius II, respectively, as a reward for their loyalty. When Nader Shah died in 1747, they capitalized on the chaos that had erupted in mainland Iran, and declared &quot;de facto&quot; independence. After Teimuraz II died in 1762, Heraclius II assumed control over Kartli, and united the two kingdoms in a personal union as the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, becoming the first Georgian ruler to preside over a politically unified eastern Georgia in three centuries. At about the same time, Karim Khan Zand had ascended the Iranian throne; Heraclius II quickly tendered his &quot;de jure&quot; submission to the new Iranian ruler, however, &quot;de facto&quot;, he remained autonomous. In 1783, Heraclius placed his kingdom under the protection of the Russian Empire in the Treaty of Georgievsk. In the last few decades of the 18th century, Georgia had become a more important element in Russo-Iranian relations than some provinces in northern mainland Persia, such as Mazandaran or even Gilan. Unlike Peter I, Catherine, the then ruling monarch of Russia, viewed Georgia as a pivot for her Caucasian policy, as Russia&#x27;s new aspirations were to use it as a base of operations against both Iran and the Ottoman Empire, both immediate bordering geo-political rivals of Russia. On top of that, having another port on the Georgian coast of the Black Sea would be ideal. A limited Russian contingent of two infantry battalions with four artillery pieces arrived in Tbilisi in 1784, but was withdrawn, despite the frantic protests of the Georgians, in 1787 as a new war against Ottoman Turkey had started on a different front.

In the next several years, Russia would be too occupied with Turkey (due to the 1768-74 war), Poland, and the European consequences of the French Revolution to give Georgia much attention. Even the consolidation of the Qajar dynasty under Agha Mohammad Khan, who had become the new owners to the Iranian throne and therefore the new heirs to the geo-politically rivalling empire that had been bordering Russia for centuries, did not divert Catherine from preoccupations in the west. In 1791, when Agha Mohammad Khan was in Tabriz, Heraclius asked General Gudovich, commander of the Russian Caucasian Line, for renewed military aid, but the government in St. Petersburg did not judge it expedient to send troops again to Georgia. In 1792, Gudovich told Heraclius that he would receive only diplomatic support in the advent of any Iranian onslaught. Despite being left to his own devices, Heraclius still cherished a dream of establishing, with Russian protection, a strong and united monarchy, into which the western Georgian Kingdom of Imereti and the lost provinces under Ottoman rule would all eventually be drawn.

The consequences of these events came a few years later, when a new dynasty, the Qajars, emerged victorious in the protracted power struggle in Persia. Their head, Agha Mohammad Khan, as his first objective, resolved to bring the Caucasus again fully under the Persian orbit.
For Agha Mohammad Khan, the resubjugation and reintegration of Georgia into the Iranian Empire was part of the same process that had brought Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz under his rule. He viewed, like the Safavids and Nader Shah before him, the territories no different than the territories in mainland Iran. Georgia was a province of Iran the same way Khorasan was. As the &quot;Cambridge History of Iran&quot; states, Georgia&#x27;s permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted in the same way as one would resist an attempt at the separation of Fars or Gilan. It was therefore natural for Agha Mohammad Khan to perform whatever necessary means in the Caucasus in order to subdue and reincorporate the recently lost regions following Nader Shah&#x27;s death and the demise of the Zands, including putting down what in Iranian eyes was seen as treason on the part of the &quot;wali&quot; of Georgia.

Finding an interval of peace amid their own quarrels and with northern, western, and central Persia secure, the Persians demanded Heraclius II to renounce the treaty with Russia and to reaccept Persian suzerainty, in return for peace and the security of his kingdom. The Ottomans, Iran&#x27;s neighboring rival, recognized Iran&#x27;s rights over Kartli and Kakheti for the first time in four centuries. Heraclius appealed then to his theoretical protector, Empress Catherine II of Russia, pleading for at least 3,000 Russian troops, but he was not listened to, leaving Georgia to fend off the Persian threat alone. Nevertheless, Heraclius II still rejected the Khan&#x27;s ultimatum.

== Battle ==

In August 1795, Agha Mohammad Khan crossed the Aras river with a 70,000-strong army. This force was divided in three: the left wing was sent in the direction of Erivan, the right one parallel to the Caspian Sea into the Mughan across the lower Aras towards Dagestan and Shirvan, while the Shah headed the centre force himself, advancing towards the fortress of Shusha in the Karabakh Khanate, which he besieged between 8 July and 9 August 1795. His right and left wing forced the Khans of Ganja and Erivan into alliance respectively. Having abandoned the siege of Shusha due to stiff resistance, which was further aided by Georgian crown prince Aleksandre, the Khan of Karabakh, Ibrahim Khan, eventually surrendered to Mohammad Khan after discussions, including the paying of regular tribute and to surrender hostages, though the Qajar forces were still denied entrance to Shusha. Since the main objective was Georgia, Mohammad Khan was willing to have Karabakh secured by this agreement for now, for he and his army subsequently moved further. While at Ganja, having secured Shirvan, he was joined by Javad Khan Qajar and the rest of his right wing contingent. At Ganja, Mohammad Khan sent Heraclius his last ultimatum, who received it in September 1795:

According to the author of the &quot;Fārsnāma-ye Nāṣeri&quot;, Ḥasan-e Fasāʼi, a contemporary Qajar era historian, Agha Mohammad Khan had declared in the letter:

His advisors divided, Heraclius ignored the ultimatum, but, sent couriers to St.Petersburg. Gudovich, who sat in Georgievsk at the time, instructed Heraclius to avoid &quot;expense and fuss&quot;, while Heraclius, together with Solomon II and some Imeretians headed southwards of Tbilisi to fend off the Iranians.

Agha Mohammad Khan at the same time marched directly on Tbilisi, with half of the army he crossed the Aras river with, though other estimations mention 40,000 instead of 35,000, and attacked the heavily fortified Georgian positions of Heraclius and Solomon on the southwestern limits of the city. Abandoned by several of his nobles, Heraclius II managed to mobilize around 5,000 troops, including some 2,000 auxiliaries from neighbouring Imereti under its King Solomon II, a member of the Georgian Bagrationi dynasty and thus distantly related to Heraclius II. The Georgians offered a desperate resistance and succeeded in rolling back a series of Persian attacks on September 9 and 10. After that, it is said that some traitors informed the Persians that the Georgians had no more strength to fight and the Qajars army cancelled their plan of going back to Persia, which they previously had. Early on September 11, Agha Mohammad Khan personally led an all-out offensive against the Georgians. Amid an artillery duel and a fierce cavalry charge, the Persians managed to cross the Kura River and outflanked the decimated Georgian army. Heraclius II attempted to mount a counterattack, but he had to retreat to the last available positions in the outskirts of Tbilisi. By nightfall, the Georgian forces had been exhausted and almost completely destroyed. The last surviving Georgian artillery briefly held the advancing Persians to allow Heraclius II and his retinue of some 150 men to escape through the city to the mountains. The fighting continued in the streets of Tbilisi and at the fortress of Narikala. In a few hours, Agha Mohammad Khan was in full control of the Georgian capital which was completely sacked and its population massacred. Among those killed in the city was the archbishop of Tbilisi, Doistheus. The Persian army marched back laden with spoil and carrying off some 15,000 captives. The Georgians had lost 4,000 men in the battle, the Iranians 13,000; a third of their total force.

An eye-witness, having entered the city several days after the bulk of the Iranian troops had withdrawn, described what he saw:

== Aftermath ==
On his return, after the conquest of Tbilisi and being in effective control of eastern Georgia, Agha Mohammad was formally crowned Shah in 1796 in the Mughan plain, just like his predecessor Nader Shah was about sixty years earlier. As &quot;The Cambridge History of Iran&quot; notes; &quot;Russia&#x27;s client, Georgia, had been punished, and Russia&#x27;s prestige, damaged.&quot; Heraclius II returned to Tbilisi to rebuild the city, but the destruction of his capital was a death blow to his hopes and projects. Upon learning of the fall of Tbilisi General Gudovich put the blame on the Georgians themselves. To restore Russian prestige, Catherine II declared war on Persia, upon the proposal of Gudovich, and sent an army under Valerian Zubov to the Qajar possessions on April of that year, but the new Tsar Paul I, who succeeded Catherine in November, shortly recalled it.

Agha Mohammad Shah was later assassinated while preparing a second expedition against Georgia in 1797 in Shusha and the seasoned king Heraclius died early in 1798. Reassessment of Iranian hegemony over Georgia did not last long; in 1799 the Russians marched into Tbilisi. The next two years were a time of muddle and confusion, and the weakened and devastated Georgian kingdom, with its capital half in ruins, was easily absorbed by Russia in 1801. As Iran could not permit or allow the cession of Transcaucasia and Dagestan the consequences of the Krtsanisi battle would also directly lead up to two wars between the nations. The Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) and Russo-Persian War (1826-1828) would eventually force the cession of the aforementioned regions to Imperial Russia per the Gulistan and Turkmenchay of 1813 and 1828 respectively.

<doc id="1263764" wikidata="Q5294040" url="?curid=1263764" title="Donald Black (sociologist)">
<text>Donald Black (1941 – January 30, 2024) was an American sociologist who was a university professor of the social sciences at the University of Virginia until his retirement in 2016. Black received his Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Michigan in 1968, and he taught at the law schools of both Yale and Harvard before moving to Virginia in 1985.

Black authored &quot;The Behavior of Law&quot;, &quot;The Manners and Customs of the Police&quot;, and &quot;Sociological Justice&quot;, all of which present various aspects of his theory of law. More recently, &quot;The Social Structure of Right and Wrong&quot; extended his theory to address conflict management more broadly, focusing on instances where people handle conflicts through means other than the law, such as through gossip, avoidance, suicide, or feuding. Black&#x27;s latest book, &quot;Moral Time&quot;, identified the causes of moral conflict in all human relationships.

Black also founded &quot;pure sociology&quot;, a distinctive theoretical approach that explains human behavior with its social geometry. Since pure sociology is a general sociological paradigm, it may be applied to subjects other than law, conflict, and conflict management—for example, art, religion, and ideas.

Black died on January 30, 2024.

<doc id="1263769" wikidata="Q810873" url="?curid=1263769" title="Batonishvili">
<text>Batonishvili (, ) is a title for royal princes and princesses who descend from the Kings of Georgia from the Bagrationi dynasty.

&quot;Batonishvili&quot; is suffixed after or before the given names e.g. David &quot;Batonishvili&quot; or &quot;Batonishvili&quot; Ioane, etc.

==History==
The title was eventually borne not only by the children of the reigning king (&quot;mepe&quot;), but by all male-line descendants of past kings. The customary attribute or form of address for a &quot;batonishvili&quot; was &quot;უგანათლებულესი&quot; (&quot;uganatlebulesi&quot;) (&quot;Most Brilliant&quot; or &quot;Most High&quot;).

There were several types of noble in the monarchies of the Caucasus, some exercising more or less sovereign authority at times, whose titles are prone to be confused with the title and rank of Batonishvili when translated from Georgian into other languages. This is partially because there were no precise Western equivalents for those titles, and partially because they all came to be translated by the Russian word for prince, &quot;Knyaz&quot;, as Russia increasingly dominated the region. 

A list of Georgian titled families was attached to the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk between Georgia and Russia pursuant to Article IX&#x27;s promise that Russia would allow those families to &quot;...enjoy all the same privileges and advantages granted to the Russian nobility&quot;. Inexplicably, the list did not differentiate among the ranks of the families included therein (although they were apparently listed in descending order of rank). Russia eventually added all of them to the Fifth Book of Nobility, wherein were already included nobles that held the title of prince but who had no claim to sovereign or quasi-sovereign rank. The first family named on the treaty&#x27;s list was that of Bagrationi, to which belonged Georgia&#x27;s king and agnates, but henceforth they and all of the other families were accorded the title of &quot;Knyaz&quot; and the rank of ordinary nobleman in Russia. 

In fact, members of the Kartli (including Mukhranian progeny of King Vakhtang V), Kakheti, and Imereti branches of the Bagrationi dynasty all bore the title of &quot;batonishvili&quot; in Georgia and had descendants living in Russia in the 19th century. The heirs of Kakheti and Imereti had been deported to Russia after their kingdoms were annexed in 1801 and 1810 respectively. Yet at the Russian court they were allowed to bear the Russian title equivalent to Batonishvili, Tsarevich, until 1833, the year following the abortive 1832 Georgian plot to restore the Georgian crown which had been led by Alexandre Batonishvili. Henceforth Georgia&#x27;s royal heirs and their descendants were demoted to &quot;Knyaz&quot;, as Prince Gruzinsky and Prince Imeretinsky, respectively.

<text>The Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi (once commonly spelled Unkiar Skelessi, and translating to The Treaty of &quot;the Royal Pier&quot; or &quot;the Sultan&#x27;s Pier&quot;) was a treaty signed between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire on July 8, 1833, following the military aid of Russia against Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt that same year. The treaty brought about an alliance between the two powers, as well as a guarantee that the Ottomans would close the Dardanelles to any foreign warships if the Russians requested such action. The treaty would have significant consequences regarding the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s foreign relations, especially with Great Britain and Ireland, as the terms of the treaty worried the other great powers of Europe.

==Background==
Mehmed Ali, ostensibly only a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, was seeking to increase his personal power and gain control over Palestine, Syria, and Arabia. In order to justify the assault on his liege, he used the pretext of a personal dispute with the pasha of Acre.

===Egyptian advance===
In late 1831, he sent his newly reformed army towards Syria, under the command of his son Ibrahim Pasha, resulting in the Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–1833) against the Ottoman sultan, Mahmud II. Ibrahim&#x27;s forces quickly captured Gaza and Jerusalem, and successfully laid siege to Acre before marching on to Aleppo and Damascus, “winning successive battles against Mahmud’s new troops, which were not yet a match for so practiced an enemy”; by June 18, 1832, Ibrahim had managed to seize control of all of Syria. For a time, the Egyptian army halted while Mehmed Ali attempted to negotiate with the Sultan. However, once it became clear that diplomacy had failed, Ibrahim led his forces into Anatolia itself where he rallied opponents of the Sultan and captured the city of Konya on November 21. Mahmud II dispatched a large army to try to halt the Egyptian advance, but it was crushed in the Battle of Konya on December 21 and “in a single blow [opened] the way for a complete conquest of Anatolia.” Ibrahim continued his advance until he was within striking distance of Istanbul, the Ottoman capital.

===Response===
Panic spread through the imperial city as the Egyptian army pushed closer to the seat of Ottoman authority. Mahmud II urgently dispatched pleas for assistance to both Britain and France, but was turned down due to domestic concerns as well as the involvement of both nations in managing the state of affairs after the recently ended Belgian Revolution. Lord Kinross argues that this left the Sultan no choice but to call upon his former enemy, Russia, for assistance. According to Bailey, the response from the Tsar was so positive and swift, that Mahmud II hesitated in accepting, believing it might be a trap. Nevertheless, the Sultan was willing to welcome any help he could receive, and accepted the Russian offer. The Tsar immediately dispatched a sizeable force of troops to block the potential Egyptian advance on Istanbul. It is unclear exactly how many troops the Tsar sent; Lord Kinross claims it was an army of approximately 18,000 men in total while Bailey suggests it may have been a force more than twice that size of nearly 40,000 troops. Regardless of the exact size of the Russian host, it was formidable enough to cause Ibrahim to decide to begin negotiating with the Sultan rather than risk a battle with the Russians. Thus, the mere presence of Russian troops was enough to halt the Egyptian onslaught.

===European reaction===
The presence of Russian troops so close to the Ottoman capital also worried Britain and France considerably. Seeing this potential threat forced the two nations into action. Lord Palmerston, the British Foreign Secretary, led the effort and brought strong diplomatic pressure “to bear upon the Sultan to insist on the Russian withdrawal, in return for concessions to Mehmed Ali and an Anglo-French guarantee against his further invasion.” Diplomacy was not the only tool they employed however, as both the British and the French dispatched fleets to the Dardanelles. This action served the dual purpose of coercing the Sultan to accept their demanding proposal, while also threatening the Russians and checking any further military action they might take.

===Consequences of the conflict and intervention===
The Sultan finally submitted, which led to the Convention of Kütahya in May 1833, which officially granted Mehmed Ali control of Syria, Adana, Tripoli, Crete, and Egypt, though these titles were not guaranteed to be hereditary upon his death. As soon as this peace was established, the Russians began the process of removing their troops from Ottoman territory. It seemed as though things had come to a reasonable end, but soon after the withdrawal of all Russian troops, the British government learned that two days prior to the completion of this evacuation, the Sultan Mahmud II had signed the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi with Tsar Nicholas I. This realization alarmed British leaders, as it seemed to indicate that Russia now held an enormous amount of influence over the Ottoman Empire and its affairs.

==Treaty==
The quickly negotiated treaty, signed on July 8, 1833, consisted primarily of a defensive alliance between Russia and the Ottoman Empire which was to initially last for eight years, and included pledges to discuss matters of security with one another. This bound the two empires together in a significant way and seemed to give the Russians the opportunity for future military interventions in the Ottoman Empire, effectively making it a protectorate of the Russian state. While this portion of the treaty was itself important, the most significant feature was its secret article.

===Secret Article===

This article called for an alternative to Ottoman military support per the terms of the treaty; rather than sending troops and arms in support of their Russian allies, the Ottomans would close the Dardanelles to all foreign warships at Russia&#x27;s command. Below is the full text of the secret article:

“In virtue of one of the clauses of Article I of the Patent Treaty of Defensive Alliance concluded between the Imperial Court of Russia and the Sublime Porte, the two High Contracting Parties, are bound to afford to each other, mutually substantial aid, and the most efficacious assistance, for the safety of their respective dominions. Nevertheless, His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, wishing to spare the Sublime Ottoman Porte the expense and inconvenience which might be occasioned to it by affording such substantial aid, will not ask for that aid, if circumstances should place the Sublime Porte under the obligation of furnishing it. The Sublime Porte, in place of aid which it is bound to furnish in case of need according to the principal of reciprocity of the Patent Treaty, shall confine its action in favour of the Imperial Court of Russia to closing the Strait of the Dardanelles, that is to say, to not allowing any foreign vessel of war to enter therein, under any pretext whatsoever.”

===Interpretations of the Secret Article===
This article was highly controversial and its true meaning is still a matter of debate. There is disagreement over what exactly the terms of the closing of the Dardanelles would be. Some interpret the lack of any specific mention of Russian warships to mean that their ships were not included with those to be barred passage through the Dardanelles. Others point out that this same lack of any specific provision for Russian warships indicates that the treaty did not grant them any special rights. There is also debate over what is meant by the phrase “in case of need.” Some believe this meant only while Russia was at war, while others interpreted it to mean that the Dardanelles would be closed to foreign warships at all times. These speculations began when the British discovered the full scope of the treaty. The secret article was not officially communicated to the British government until January 16, 1834, but they were aware of it several months before that point.

The British interpreted the treaty and its secret clause to have a potentially great impact on their relations with Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and the established balance of power. Hale argues that Lord Palmerston was stung into action “since he mistakenly believed that [the treaty’s] secret clause had given Russian warships free passage through the straits.” Additionally, Palmerston and the rest of the British government saw that “while the immediate advantages of the treaty were slight, the ‘potential advantage to Russia’ was very great, in that ‘in accustoming the Porte to the position of vassal’ Russia had ‘prepared the way for a repetition of the 1833 expedition.’” They feared that this potential for future Russian intervention in the Ottoman Empire would threaten British connections with India and trade in the Near East as a whole, though as Bailey puts it, “The Foreign Secretary’s immediate concern, however, was the problem of the Straits.” This interpretation of the treaty was to shape British foreign policy towards the Ottoman Empire for decades to come.

==Consequences of the treaty==
According to Bailey, the signing of the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi was what fully awakened Britain to “the importance of the Ottoman Empire’s geographical, political, and economic position in Europe.” In the short term, the British protested the treaty, claiming that it violated the Anglo-Ottoman Treaty of 1809, which set forth terms that no foreign warship would be allowed to enter the straits. Their formal protest concluded “if the stipulations of that treaty (Unkiar Skelessi) should hereafter lead to the armed interference of Russia in the internal affairs of Turkey, the British government will hold itself at liberty to act upon such an occasion, in any manner which the circumstances of the moment may appear to require.” The French also issued a similar statement regarding their concerns about possible Russian military interference. These two statements were indicative of how seriously the terms of the treaty were taken by the Western powers.

In the longer term, the British became convinced that a different approach was needed, and committed to a policy that “the Ottoman Empire was to be preserved, supported, reformed, and strengthened.” From that point forward, the British, under Palmerston&#x27;s leadership, took a number of actions to enact this new policy towards the Ottoman Empire. These ranged from increased trade with the Ottomans to a strengthening of the British fleet in the Levant and offers of both military and naval missions to Mahmud II both to aid the Sultan should Mehmed Ali threaten further military action, and “as a gesture to redress Britain’s former neglect.”

While Britain certainly took the most active role, it was not the only European power which took an interest in the Ottoman Empire as a result of this treaty. Not long after the signing of the treaty, Austria and Prussia joined Russia in the Münchengrätz Convention of September 18, 1833, which committed the powers to opposing further expansion by Mehmed Ali and to “maintain[ing] Ottoman integrity.” In July 1840, a broader coalition was formed including Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, which agreed to protect the Sultan&#x27;s government against Mehmed Ali; this agreement, known as the Convention of London (1840) also required that the Ottomans declare that the straits would be closed to all non-Ottoman warships in peacetime. European support, specifically that of the British, also aided in the ultimate submission of Mehmet Ali; in an agreement signed in June 1841, he accepted the limitation of his army in exchange for guarantees of hereditary governorship of Egypt for his family. This marked “the emergence of Britain as a more active player in the Near Eastern power game, and the Ottoman Empire’s main ally for the next 37 years.” Thus, the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi had long-lasting effects on the future of the Ottoman Empire, and especially on European outlooks towards that same future.

==End of the treaty==
Not long after its signing, the terms of the treaty would be progressively weakened by other treaties and agreements. The Convention of London (1840) took the first big step by compelling the Ottomans to keep the straits closed to all non-Ottoman warships in peacetime. This helped assuage the British fear that the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi had effectively granted the Russian fleet free passage through the straits and into the Mediterranean. Another step towards nullifying the treaty came in the form of the London Straits Convention the following year. This agreement barred all warships from entering the straits, save those of allies of the Sultan in wartime. While it may seem that this agreement does not change much, it is important to remember that at this point, Britain was one of the Sultan&#x27;s allies. Thus, this would allow the British fleet to enter the straits in times of war, eliminating the perceived exclusive right of the Russians to do so. By this point, the most important aspect of the treaty had effectively been negated. Russo-Ottoman relations continued to deteriorate in the following decade, and while it is unclear when the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi was entirely invalidated, it can be said with certainty that the coming of the Crimean War meant the end of any potential for the continuation of the Russo-Ottoman alliance set out in the treaty.

==Political career==

===Member of Parliament===
In 1992, Baramidze was elected to the Parliament of Georgia from bloc &quot;Green Party of Georgia&quot; and served as the Secretary for the Commission of Human Rights and National Minorities and as a member of the Parliamentary Defense and Security Commission. He was also elected a member of the State Coordination Commission of Georgia&#x27;s participation in NATO Partnership for Peace Program (PFP). In 1995, he was one of the co-founders of Eduard Shevardnadze&#x27;s Union of Citizens of Georgia Party and was elected its deputy chairman, acting as Secretary General of the party from 1995 through 1996.
In the 1995 parliamentary elections, he was elected from the Didube district of Tbilisi from bloc &quot;Union of citizens of Georgia&quot;. In 1996, he was elected Chairman of the Investigation Commission of the Parliamentary Anti-Corruption Committee. As a result of anti-corruption activities, he masterminded having the following several ministers resign, D. Gulua (Minister of Agriculture), P. Injia (Minister of Communications and Postage), D. Zubitashvili (Minister of Energy), D. Iakobidze (Minister of Finance) and D. Eliashvili (Chairman of Department of Gas of Georgia) among them.

In 1996, Baramidze was elected chairman of the parliamentary faction of the Union of Citizens of Georgia. A year later, he started joint Georgian government-UNDP program on Corruption Investigation Center becoming its first director.

From 1998 through 1999, Baramidze worked as an Associate Researcher at Institute for the Study of Diplomacy of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., conducting research on U.S. government policy, structures and functions as well as on political, military and defense issues in Caucasus.

Upon his return to Georgia in 1999, he was re-elected to the parliament from Didube district and elected Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee in 2000 and Chairman of the Faction of the United Democrats of Parliament of Georgia in 2002, subsequently playing a pivotal role in the Rose Revolution in November 2003.

===Ministerial positions===

With the new government in power in late 2003, he was appointed Minister of Internal Affairs of Georgia.

He was seen as a member of the government faction grouped around the then Prime Minister (and Rose Revolution leader) Zurab Zhvania that were seen to be in opposition to the President Mikheil Saakashvili. As such he publicly cast doubt upon the official explanation for Zhvania&#x27;s death due to carbon monoxide poisoning and instead appeared to endorse the possibility of foul play stating &quot;none of the versions [of explanation for his death] should be ruled out.&quot;

In June 2004, he was appointed Minister of Defense replacing Gela Bezhuashvili. In December 2004, he was moved to the post of Vice Premier and State Minister for Euro-Atlantic Integration.

<text>The Sudbury Star is a Canadian daily regional newspaper published in Sudbury, Ontario. It is owned by the media company, Postmedia. It is the largest daily paper in Northeastern Ontario by circulation.

==History==

The &quot;Sudbury Star&quot; began as a daily in January 1909 as the &quot;Northern Daily Star&quot;, in competition with the city&#x27;s established daily &quot;Sudbury Journal&quot;, but it was in immediate financial trouble and folded within just six months. Staff took over ownership of the struggling newspaper, led by foreman William Edge Mason, who then found 10 prominent investors to provide financial backing to the paper. W.E. Mason Equipment was created to take over management of the paper, and by World War I the paper was flourishing and the &quot;Sudbury Journal&quot; was out of business. In 1922 Mason acquired the &quot;North Bay Nugget&quot; in North Bay.

In 1935, Mason launched the city&#x27;s first commercial radio station, CKSO.

In 1948, Mason died and ownership of the paper was taken over by his W.E. Mason Estate. The &quot;Nugget&quot; was almost immediately sold in an employee buyout, but the &quot;Sudbury Star&quot; remained under the ownership of Mason&#x27;s estate until 1950, when J. R. Meakes, Mason&#x27;s successor as publisher and general manager, bought the paper with co-investors George Miller, Jim Cooper and Bill Plaunt. The same investment group launched CKSO-TV, the city&#x27;s first television station and the first television station in Canada not owned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in 1953.

In 1955 the paper was acquired by Thomson Newspapers. Meakes remained as publisher and general manager until his retirement in 1975.

In the early 1960s, the city saw a &quot;newspaper war&quot; between two startup weekly newspapers, the &quot;Sudbury Sun&quot; and the &quot;Star&quot;-owned &quot;Sudbury Scene&quot;. The &quot;Sun&quot;, a publication of Northland Publishers, was out of business by 1962, and filed a competition lawsuit against the &quot;Scene&quot;, alleging that the &quot;Scene&quot; had deliberately undercut the &quot;Sun&quot;&#x27;s advertising rates to protect Thomson&#x27;s monopoly on English-language periodical publication in the city. The federal trade practices commission ruled in Thomson&#x27;s favour.

The paper was sold to Southam Newspapers in 1996, to Osprey Media in 2001, and to Sun Media in 2007. In 2015 Postmedia Network acquired Sun Media.

In October 2013 the paper moved from its longtime home at 33 MacKenzie Street in Sudbury to new offices at 128 Pine Street. In 2020, the paper moved again, to an office building on Regent Street in the Lily Creek neighbourhood.

The current managing editor of the &quot;Sudbury Star&quot; is Don MacDonald, who assumed the role in 2014.

<doc id="1263778" wikidata="Q469561" url="?curid=1263778" title="Irakli Okruashvili">
<text>Irakli Okruashvili () (born November 6, 1973) is a Georgian politician who had served on various high-ranking posts in the Government of Georgia under President Mikheil Saakashvili, including being the Minister of Defense from December 2004 until being dismissed in November 2006.

In September 2007, Okruashvili staged a public comeback to Georgian politics, openly confronting Mikheil Saakashvili and creating the opposition party Movement for United Georgia. On September 27, 2007, Okruashvili was briefly arrested at his party headquarters on the charges of corruption, money laundering, and abuse of office. In 2007 he left Georgia and was granted political asylum in France. He was sentenced to 11-year prison term in Georgia in absentia in March 2008. In October 2010, he, remaining in France, joined Sozar Subari, Levan Gachechiladze and Erosi Kitsmarishvili in the new Georgian Party.

Okruashvili was sentenced to five years in prison for allegedly participating in group violence in anti-government rallies organized in June 2019. However, President Salome Zourabichvili pardoned him, alongside Gigi Ugulava, on May 15, 2020.

On March 8, 2022, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence stated that Okruashvili had arrived in Ukraine, together with other Georgian volunteers, to fight against the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

== Political career ==

Irakli Okruashvili was born in Tskhinvali, South Ossetian AO, Georgian SSR. He graduated from Faculty of International Law and Relations at Tbilisi State University. He then worked as an attorney.

===In government===

Okruashvili served as the Deputy Minister of Justice from 2000 to 2001. He joined Mikhail Saakashvili&#x27;s United National Movement and was elected as a member of Tbilisi Assembly (Sakrebulo) in 2002. After the Rose Revolution, Okruashvili was appointed the Person Authorized (governor) of the president of Georgia in Shida Kartli (to which breakaway South Ossetia was a de jure part) in December 2003 and established strong anti-corruption and anti-smuggling measures in the region.

He served as the Prosecutor General from January 2004 until Saakashvili appointed him Interior Minister in June 2004 and moved him to the post of defence minister in December 2004. During his tenure as defence minister, Okruashvili was known for advocating military actions against the separatists in South Ossetia.

Okruashvili said on May 1, 2006, that he would resign if Georgia failed to restore control over breakaway South Ossetian by January 1, 2007.

On November 10, 2006, Saakashvili appointed him Minister for Economic Development. Davit Kezerashvili became the Minister of Defence. Okruashvili resigned as Minister for Economic Development on November 17, 2006.

===In opposition===

On September 25, 2007, he announced the formation of the new opposition Movement for United Georgia and unleashed criticism on President Saakashvili, accusing him of corruption, incompetency and human rights violations. He also raised new concerns around Zurab Zhvania&#x27;s death, challenging the official investigation point of view and personally accused the Georgian president in planning the murder of businessman Badri Patarkatsishvili.

Speculations about Okruashvili&#x27;s planned party had been circulating for a long time already and many commentators expected, what they called, &quot;a war of compromising materials&quot; in case of Okruashvili&#x27;s political comeback. The presentation was preceded by the controversies over financial irregularities surrounding the party&#x27;s new office and the arrest of Mikheil Kareli, Orkuashvili&#x27;s close associate and governor of Shida Kartli, on the charges of corruption.

=== Arrest ===
On September 27, 2007, Okruashvili was detained on charges of extortion, money laundering, and abuse of office while Georgia&#x27;s defense minister. On September 28, 2007, several opposition parties organized a peaceful mass rally in Okruashvili&#x27;s support at the Parliament of Georgia.

On October 8, 2007, in a video taped confession released by the General Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, Okruashvili pleaded guilty to large-scale bribery through extortion and negligence while serving as minister and retracted his accusations against the president, winning release on bail of 10 million Georgian lari. He also said that his earlier accusations levelled against Saakashvili were not true and were aimed at gaining political dividends for himself and Badri Patarkatsishvili and at discrediting the President of Georgia. Some opposition leaders said Okruashvili&#x27;s statement had been made under duress. Okruashvili declared, however, that he had decided to cooperate with the investigation to &quot;mitigate [his] situation&quot;.

=== Expulsion from Georgia ===

After he pleaded guilty, Okruashvili was released. Okruashvili left Georgia around November 1, 2007. He subsequently said he was forced into exile; the government said he had asked to leave because of medical issues.

On November 5, 2007, Okruashvili made a surprise appearance on Imedi TV from Munich, claiming that he had been forced to retract accusations against President Saakashvili while being in jail. A Georgian prosecuting officer, however, rejected Okruashvili&#x27;s allegations, while the senior members of the Parliament of Georgia for the ruling party described him &quot;an instrument in the hands of Patarkatsishvili&quot;, the owner of Imedi TV, who financed opposition rallies against the Georgian government.

On November 14, 2007, following a Prosecutor&#x27;s Office request, a court in Tbilisi ruled that Okruashvili be returned to police custody pending investigation. In December 2007, he was arrested in Germany at the request of Georgia, but was later transferred to France, where a court ruled that he be freed on bail with Georgia&#x27;s extradition request to be examined on April 16, 2008. In the meantime, a Georgian court found him guilty of &quot;large-scale extortion&quot; and sentenced him to 11 years in prison in absentia on March 28, 2008. On April 23, 2008, he was granted political asylum. The French courts ultimately rejected the extradition request as well.

In September 2008 &quot;Reuters&quot; reported Okruashvili had said that Saakashvili had long planned the 2008 South Ossetia war but had executed it poorly. While defence minister from 2004 to 2006 he and Saakashvili worked together on military plans to retake South Ossetia and Abkhazia, saying &quot;Abkhazia was our strategic priority, but we drew up military plans in 2005 for taking both Abkhazia and South Ossetia as well&quot;.

In October 2010, Okruashvili resigned his position in the Movement for United Georgia and shortly afterwards joined with the high-profile Georgia-based politicians — Sozar Subari, Levan Gachechiladze, and Erosi Kitsmarishvili to establish a new opposition party, the Georgian Party.

=== Return, imprisonment and release===
In a phone interview with the Tbilisi-based Maestro TV on May 22, 2011, he said &quot;On May 25 I will be in Georgia together with my people. I will not talk about details. On May 25 we will manage to put an end to Saakashvili&#x27;s regime with minimal losses. If there is a great public support, the losses will be minimal. So, everybody should acknowledge the responsibility, which should be assumed before our country.&quot;

After government change in Georgia Okruashvili, who faces multiple criminal charges in Georgia, returned from his French exile back to his home country. But despite a broad amnesty for political prisoners he was arrested upon arrival in the Tbilisi airport on November 20, 2012. Georgian Justice Minister, Tea Tsulukiani, commented, that she shared the view that Okruashvili &quot;was subjected to politically-motivated persecution by the [previous] authorities.&quot; &quot;But it does not automatically mean that he is innocent in those criminal charges that he may face; it requires investigation,&quot; Tsulukiani told journalists. &quot;There are number of criminal charges brought against him and the most recent one is related to setting up of illegal armed groups and that is related to the events of May, 2011 [during street protest rallies]. It requires further probe and I think that Okruashvili returned in order to prove his truth.&quot; Irakli Okruashvili was released from a courtroom on January 11. His release was made possible after Okruashvili was cleared of bribe-taking and extortion charges during a hearing in the Court of Appeals on January 10 and after the Tbilisi City Court accepted on January 11 a motion from prosecutors to release Okruashvili from custody on GEL 15,000 bail. A trial into negligence will be continued later in the Tbilisi City Court.

After his release Okruashvili gave an interview to Reuters to define the reasons of his return to Georgia after several years of residence in France under political asylum. Okruashvili sayd Georgia&#x27;s prosecution does not use him as &quot;a golden witness&quot; against President Saakashvili, as it was suggested in the Georgian media, and there was no big agreement with the new government about any issue. &quot;My return (to the country) was just based on my decision and that`s it&quot;, Okruashvili said.

<doc id="1263779" wikidata="Q1073336" url="?curid=1263779" title="Consolamentum">
<text>Consolamentum (called heretication by its Catholic opponents) was the unique sacrament of the Cathars. Cathars believed in original sin, and – like Gnostics – believed temporal pleasure to be sinful or unwise. The process of living thus inevitably incurred &quot;regret&quot; that required &quot;consolation&quot; to move nearer to God or to approach heaven. It occurred only twice in a lifetime: upon confirmation in the faith and upon impending death. It was available to both men and women who made a commitment to the faith. Following the ceremony the consoled individual became a &quot;Cathar Perfect&quot; or &quot;Parfait&quot;.

According to the Albigenses and other Cathars, the &quot;consolamentum&quot; was an immersion (or baptism) in the Holy Spirit. It implied reception of all spiritual gifts including absolution from sin, spiritual regeneration, the power to preach, and elevation to a higher plane of perfection.

==The ritual==
Reference to the trinity was systematically replaced with the name of Christ since the doctrine of the Albigenses and Cathars professed a modalistic or (in the east) adoptionistic doctrine about God&#x27;s nature. 

The ritual took various forms; some used the entire New Testament scripture whilst others relied on extracts such as the Gospel of John while administering consolation. There were reportedly some remote cases where holy water was used as a cleansing agent during &quot;consolamentum&quot; being profusely poured over the recipient&#x27;s head until he/she was completely wet (as opposed to sprinkling).

In contrast to Catholic ceremonies, the form used by the majority of Cathars only required verbal blessings and scriptures administered to the person to be consoled, and did not involve s such as consecrated bread or wine, because these would pass through the body and become befouled. Dying persons might abstain from food in order that their body be as pure as possible as it passed into eternity.

According to a few known cases in the latter years of Catharism, the terminally ill would voluntarily undertake a complete fast known as the endura. It was only undertaken when death was clearly inevitable. It was a form of purification and separation from the material world which was controlled by the evil one. They believed that this final sacrifice ensured their reunification with the Good God.

Laying on of hands was always part of the ceremony. Some historians have stated that incidents of ecstatic utterances during &quot;consolamentum&quot; was actually glossolalia, or &quot;speaking in tongues&quot;, which demanded that the rite be guarded even more secretly, since this practice occurring outside of the Catholic Church was considered witchcraft, and was punishable by death.

==After the ritual==
Once consoled, Parfaits were required to be pescatarian, to be celibate, and to dedicate their lives to travelling and teaching Cathar doctrines. These Parfaits were the leaders of the Cathar communities.

The vast majority of believers did not receive &quot;consolamentum&quot; until on the verge of death. Once given the &quot;consolamentum&quot;, the same rules applied to them except for not being expected to travel or preach from their deathbed. This allowed most Cathars to live somewhat ordinary lives, and receive &quot;consolamentum&quot; shortly before passing away.

<text>Dry transfers (also called rub-ons or rubdowns) are decals that can be applied without the use of water or other solvent. The decal itself is on a backing material such as paper or plastic sheeting much like a transparency. The dry transfer is placed in the desired location with the backing side up. The decal is then applied by burnishing the backing with a stylus or similar object such as a ballpoint pen. The contact side of the decal includes a pressure-sensitive adhesive; the combination of heat and pressure causes the decal to stick more strongly to the new surface than to the backing. When the backing is removed, the decal remains. This allows for ink only where needed even if the pattern is delicate, because the backing supports the decal while it is being applied.

Dry transfers are used in manual technical drawing when standard graphic elements such as title blocks, forms, patterned lines, shading, piping or electronic schematic symbols need to be repetitively used. Use of a dry transfer reduces drawing time and standardizes appearance. Dry transfer lettering such as Letraset brand is used where hand-drawn lettering is laborious to apply. From the 1960s to the 1980s, dry transfers featuring action scenes were a popular children&#x27;s pastime.

<text>Tetri () is a fractional currency used in the country of Georgia. It was put into circulation in 1995.

The name &quot;tetri&quot; (&quot;white&quot;) was adopted from the term describing golden, silver or copper coins known in ancient and medieval Georgia.

The plural of the term &quot;tetri&quot; is &quot;tetrebi.&quot; However, the Georgian language uses the singular form when the quantity is specified, so in practice the plural of &quot;tetri&quot; is just &quot;tetri.&quot;

In some instances tetri is informally referred to as &quot;kapiki&quot;, derived from the Russian fractional currency kopek from the Soviet era.

100 tetri = 1 lari.
