<text>The Grand Trianon () is a French Baroque style château situated in the northwestern part of the Domain of Versailles in Versailles, France. It was built at the request of Louis XIV as a retreat for himself and his &quot;maîtresse-en-titre&quot; of the time, the Marquise de Montespan, and as a place where he and invited guests could take light meals (&quot;collations&quot;) away from the strict etiquette of the royal court. The Grand Trianon is set within its own park, which includes the Petit Trianon (a smaller château built in the 1760s, during the reign of Louis XV).

==&quot;Trianon de porcelaine&quot;==

Between 1663 and 1665, Louis XIV purchased the hamlet of Trianon, on the outskirts of Versailles. In 1670, he commissioned the architect Louis Le Vau to design a porcelain pavilion (&quot;Trianon de porcelaine&quot;) to be built there. 

The façade was made of white and blue Delft-style porcelain (ceramic) tiles from the French manufactures of Rouen, Lisieux, Nevers and Saint-Cloud. Construction began in 1670 and was finished two years later. Since it was made of porcelain, the building suffered from deterioration. Louis XIV ordered its demolition in 1686 and replaced it with a larger building.

==&quot;Trianon de marbre&quot;==
===Under Louis XIV===
By 1686, the fragile porcelain tiles of the &quot;Trianon de porcelaine&quot; had deteriorated to such a point that Louis XIV ordered the demolition of the pavilion and its replacement with one made of stronger material. Commission of the work was entrusted to the architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart. Hardouin-Mansart&#x27;s new structure was twice the size of the porcelain pavilion, and the material used was red marble from Languedoc. 

Begun in June 1687, the new construction (as we see it today) was finished in January 1688. It was inaugurated by Louis XIV and his secret wife, the Marquise de Maintenon, during the summer of 1688. 

Hardouin-Mansart&#x27;s early plans for the building were substantially altered during construction, with the original intention of keeping the core of the &quot;Trianon de porcelaine&quot; intact vetoed in favor of an open-air peristyle with a screen of red marble columns facing onto the garden. At least three other structures were built at the center of the new building and then torn down before the peristyle was settled on, during the frantic building activity of the summer of 1687. The sloping Mansard roof of the original design, meant to harmonize with the roof of the &quot;Trianon de porcelaine&quot;, was vetoed by the king, who felt it looked too &quot;heavy&quot; on the structure. The long interior gallery which forks west from the main wing was built on the spot of a favorite outdoor promenade that Louis XIV enjoyed at the old &quot;Trianon de porcelaine&quot;. 

The interior design scheme departed significantly from what Louis XIV and his architects had established at the Palace of Versailles. Louis reputedly ordered the architects to &quot;Paint everything white. No gilt or color for the walls of Trianon.&quot; This was a departure from the variegated marbles, rich colors, and gilding which defined the interiors at Versailles. Instead of the heavy ornamentation on display in the palace, the walls of the Trianon were covered in delicately carved wood &quot;boiseries&quot;, with plaster friezes, pilasters, and capitals of noticeably more refined, delicate appearance.

The Trianon was home to Louis XIV&#x27;s extended family, housing his son and heir Louis, Grand Dauphin from 1703 to 1711. The domain was also a favourite retreat of the Duchess of Burgundy, the wife of his grandson Louis de France, the parents of Louis XV. In the later years of Louis XIV&#x27;s reign, the Trianon was the residence of the King&#x27;s sister-in-law Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, Dowager Duchess of Orléans and known at court as &quot;Madame&quot;. Her son, Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, future son-in-law of Louis XIV and Regent of France, lived there with his mother. Louis XIV even ordered the construction of a larger wing for the Trianon, which was begun in 1708 by Hardouin-Mansart; this wing, called &quot;Trianon-sous-Bois&quot;, housed the Orléans family, including Louis XIV&#x27;s legitimised daughter Françoise-Marie de Bourbon. 

The king&#x27;s youngest grandson, Charles de France, and his wife Marie Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans also resided there. The Orléans family, who had apartments at the Palace of Versailles, were later replaced by Françoise-Marie&#x27;s sister; the Duchess of Bourbon, &quot;Madame la Duchesse&quot;, lived at the Trianon and later built the Palais Bourbon in Paris, the design of which copied the Trianon. 
In 1708, the prototypes for the &quot;commodes Mazarine&quot;, then called &quot;bureaux&quot;, were delivered to the Trianon by André-Charles Boulle. The first Duke of Antin, Louis Antoine de Pardaillan de Gondrin, director of the Bâtiments du Roi, wrote to Louis XIV: &quot;I was at the Trianon inspecting the second writing desk by Boulle; it is as beautiful as the other and suits the room perfectly.&quot;

In 1717, Peter the Great of Russia, who was studying the palace and gardens of Versailles, resided at the Trianon; the Peterhof Palace was inspired by Versailles.

===Louis XV and after===

Louis XV did not bring any changes to the Grand Trianon. In 1740 and 1743, his father-in-law, Stanisław Leszczyński, former king of Poland, stayed there during his visits to Versailles. In 1741, Louis XV gifted the Grand Trianon to his wife Marie Leszczyńska. Later, it was during a stay at Trianon that Louis XV fell ill before being transported to the Palace of Versailles, where he died on 10 May 1774.

No more than his predecessor had, Louis XVI brought no structural modifications to the Grand Trianon. His wife, Queen Marie Antoinette, who preferred the Petit Trianon, gave a few theatrical representations in the &quot;galerie des Cotelle&quot;, a gallery with paintings by Jean l&#x27;Aîné Cotelle representing the bosquets of Versailles and Trianon. 

During the French Revolution of 1789, the Grand Trianon was left to neglect. At the time of the First French Empire, Napoleon made it one of his residences, and he furnished it in the Empire Style. Napoleon lived at Trianon with his second wife, Marie Louise of Austria. The next royals to live at the Grand Trianon were the King and Queen of the French – Louis Philippe I and his Italian wife Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies. He was a descendant of the Regent Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, and she was a niece of Marie Antoinette. In October 1837, Marie d&#x27;Orléans (daughter of Louis Philippe I) married Alexander of Württemberg at the Grand Trianon. Louis Philippe made sanitary alterations to the Grand Trianon, moving the kitchens and offices to the basement and adding plumbing. Despite these changes &quot;the general character of the palace was unchanged, and even the original arrangement of the rooms was preserved,&quot; according to Pierre de Nolhac.

In 1873, Marshal François Achille Bazaine was imprisoned for treason at the Grand Trianon and his trial took place in the peristyle.

In 1920, the Grand Trianon hosted the negotiations and signing of the Treaty of Trianon, which left Hungary with less than one-third of its pre-World War I land size. To Hungarians, the word &quot;Trianon&quot; remains to this day the symbol of one of their worst national disasters.

In 1963, Charles de Gaulle ordered a renovation of the building. 

A popular site today for tourists visiting Versailles, it is also one of the French Republic&#x27;s presidential residences used to host foreign officials.

<text>Corey Jermaine Simon Sr. (born March 2, 1977) is an American politician and former professional football player. A member of the Republican Party, he has served as the Florida State Senator from the 3rd district since 2022. He played as a defensive tackle for eight seasons in the National Football League (NFL).

He played college football for the Florida State Seminoles, earned consensus All-American honors, and was a member of a BCS National Championship team. He was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles with the sixth overall pick in the 2000 NFL draft, and he played professionally for the Eagles, Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans. He was selected to the 2004 Pro Bowl.

==Early life==
Simon was born in Pompano Beach, Florida. He attended Blanche Ely High School, where he played for the Ely Mighty Tigers high school football team. As a senior, he was the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;&#x27;s defensive player of the year, named to the All-USA squad by &quot;USA Today&quot;, and a Super Prep Dream Team selection.

==College career==
Simon accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Florida State University, where he played for coach Bobby Bowden&#x27;s Seminoles teams from 1996 to 1999. He was considered to be the most dominating defensive lineman in college football. Following his senior season, Simon was a first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) selection, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American. He was also a finalist for the Lombardi Award and Outland Trophy. He ended his career at FSU by helping his team win a BCS National Championship. His 44 tackles behind the line of scrimmage tied the Seminoles&#x27; career record set by Ron Simmons.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia Eagles===

The Philadelphia Eagles selected him in the first round (sixth pick overall) of the 2000 NFL draft, and he played for the Eagles from 2000 until 2004. He started in four NFC Championship games during his six seasons with the Eagles. Philadelphia reached the Super Bowl once during these years, losing Super Bowl XXXIX to the New England Patriots, 24–21. After the 2004 season, the Eagles placed the franchise tag on Simon, which he refused to sign. After contract negotiations failed to produce a long-term deal, the Eagles lifted the franchise tag, making Simon an unrestricted free agent.

===Indianapolis Colts===
Simon signed with the Indianapolis Colts, for whom he played the entire 2005 season. In 2006, Simon underwent surgery, was placed on the Physically Unable to Perform / Non-Football Injury list during training camp, and did not play in any games. He did not attend Super Bowl XLI with other inactive players. However, he was still delivered a ring. He was once coined &quot;the missing piece to the Super Bowl puzzle&quot;.

On August 1, 2007, Colts owner Jim Irsay stated that Simon&#x27;s release from the team was imminent, once a settlement could be reached. The team announced Simon&#x27;s release on August 4.

===Tennessee Titans===
On August 28, 2007, the Tennessee Titans signed Simon. On October 25, Simon announced that he was retiring from professional football after eight seasons in the NFL because of polyarthritis.

==NFL career statistics==


==Political career==
On June 13, 2022, Simon announced his candidacy for Florida&#x27;s Third senatorial district, running as a Republican against Democrat Loranne Ausley, after serving as CEO of Volunteer Florida. Due to redistricting, the Florida Legislature redrew Florida&#x27;s Third senatorial district boundaries to the east and reduced the Democratic advantage seen in previous elections. Simon had the backing and was recruited by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Senate President Kathleen Passidomo and Senator Ben Albritton, due to his association with Florida State University football. Simon canceled a debate with the &quot;Tallahassee Democrat&quot; and the League of Women Voters, labeling them a &quot;liberal farce&quot;. Simon also accused Ausley and the Florida Democratic Party of funding racist advertisements depicting photos of children with nearby bullet holes and targets, as well as Simon in a target frame with stray bullets to the side. The flyer was produced by the Florida Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, led by Minority Leader Lauren Book. Simon campaigned heavily against votes Ausley made during her time in the Florida Legislature such as voting against the Fairness in Women&#x27;s Sports Act (SB 1028) which specifies that an athletic team or sport that is designated for females, women, or girls may not be open to students of the male sex, based on the student&#x27;s biological sex listed on the student&#x27;s official birth certificate at the time of birth. Simon also repeatedly went after her vote against the Parental Rights in Education Act, which prohibits &quot;classroom instruction&quot; on sexual orientation or gender identity in &quot;kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards&quot;. On November 8, 2022, Simon defeated Ausley in the general election with 53% of the vote. Simon is the first African American Republican State Senator from Florida since Reconstruction.

<doc id="1250486" wikidata="Q6490259" url="?curid=1250486" title="Larry Elliott">
<text>Larry Elliott (born 29 August 1955) is an English journalist and author who focuses on economic issues. He was the economics editor at &quot;The Guardian&quot; until November 2024, and has published seven books on related issues, six of them in partnership with Dan Atkinson.

==Early life==
Elliott was educated at St Albans School, an independent school for boys in St Albans, Hertfordshire, in southern England, followed by Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he read history.

==Journalistic career==
* &quot;The Evening Post-Echo&quot;, Hemel Hempstead, 1978 to 1983
* Press Association, 1983 to 1988
* &quot;The Guardian&quot;, 1988 to date

Elliott&#x27;s areas of particular interest are globalisation, trade, Europe, development, and the interface between economics and the environment. He is on the editorial board of &quot;Catalyst&quot;, on the board of the Scott Trust, a council member of the Overseas Development Institute and a visiting fellow at the University of Hertfordshire.

Elliott&#x27;s 2007 book, &quot;Fantasy Island,&quot; argued that the British economy was weaker than it appeared and that a recession could dramatically damage its base of services. He supported Britain leaving the European Union and voted to leave the European Economic Community in the 1975 referendum.

Elliott, an outspoken critic of the European Union, authored articles for &quot;The Guardian&quot; such as “Brexit is a rejection of Globalisation”. He stated that the British people&#x27;s decision to leave the European Union in 2016 is testament to its failure to act on its promises to protect its member states from the worst effects of globalisation, which he considers would have included the funding of more affordable homes and the provision of more employment opportunities. 

Elliott was economics editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot; from 1996 to November 2024.

<doc id="1250487" wikidata="Q6761676" url="?curid=1250487" title="Maria Zofia Czartoryska">
<text>Countess Maria Zofia Czartoryska née &quot;Sieniawska&quot; (15 April 1699–21 May 1771) was a Polish szlachcianka (noblewoman). By birth she was member of powerful Sieniawski family and by marriage she was member of House of Dönhoff and House of Czartoryski.

==Early life==
Countess Maria Zofia was daughter of Count Adam Mikołaj Sieniawski and Princess Elżbieta Lubomirska.

==First marriage==
She married firstly Count Stanislaus Ernst von Dönhoff in 1724. She was his second wife. He was previously married to his cousin, Countess Johanna Katharina von Dönhoff (1686-1723). Maria Zofia&#x27;s stepdaughter Countess Konstanza von Dönhoff later married Prince Janusz Aleksander Sanguszko.

==Inheritance==
After her father&#x27;s death in 1726, Maria Zofia inherited his Ruthenian estates including 35 towns, 235 villages and Berezhany fortress, she was also the only heir of her first husband&#x27;s estates and of her mother&#x27;s fortune.

==Second marriage==
Among the candidates to the hand of one of the wealthiest women in Europe were Prince Charles de Bourbon-Condé, Count of Charolais, supported by France (Louis XV even invited Maria Zofia to Versailles); Portuguese infante Dom Manuel de Bragança supported by the Habsburgs (proposed as the next King of Poland, due to the tenets of the Löwenwolde&#x27;s Treaty), Jan Klemens Branicki, Franciszek Salezy Potocki, Jan Tarło and August Aleksander Czartoryski, who eventually won the competition, full of duels and speech encounters due to support of Augustus II, as the latter was afraid of increase of power of his opponents. She married August Aleksander Czartoryski on 17 July 1731 in Warsaw.

<doc id="1250490" wikidata="Q723654" url="?curid=1250490" title="Brook trout">
<text>The brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is a species of freshwater fish in the char genus &quot;Salvelinus&quot; of the salmon family Salmonidae native to Eastern North America in the United States and Canada. Two ecological forms of brook trout have been recognized by the US Forest Service. One ecological form is long-lived potamodromous populations in Lake Superior known as coaster trout or coasters. The second ecological form is the short-living predaceous anadromous populations which are found in northern lakes and coastal rivers from Long Island to Hudson Bay, which are referred to as salters. In parts of its range, it is also known as the eastern brook trout, speckled trout, brook char (or charr), squaretail, brookie, or mud trout, among others. Adult coaster brook trout are capable of reaching sizes over 2&quot; &quot;feet in length and weigh up to 6.8&quot; &quot;kg (15&quot; &quot;lb), whereas adult salters average between 6 and 15&quot; &quot;inches in length and weigh between 0.5 and 2.3&quot; &quot;kg (1 and 5&quot; &quot;lb). The brook trout is characterized by its distinctive olive-green body with yellow and blue-rimmed red spots, white and black edged orange fins, and dorsal vermiculation. The diet of the brook trout is restrictive to the season and location of the fish, but will typically consist of terrestrial and aquatic insects, fry, crustaceans, zooplankton, and worms.

Throughout history, non-native brook trout have been transplanted beyond its native borders, where it has spread across North America and much of the world. These brook trout have been introduced since the 1800s by means of artificial propagation and aquaculture in hope of promoting fishery resources. Through this transplantation, brook trout have been observed to affect native populations by outcompeting, preying upon, and hybridizing with many native aquatic species. This invasive nature via human-mediated introductory has led to their classification in the list of the top 100 globally invasive species.

Since the 19th century, isolated native eastern brook trout populations have faced extirpation due to stream pollution, habitat destruction, invasive species, and waterway damming. Although facing these pressures, the brook trout is not listed as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but native population decline has been observed. 

==Taxonomy==
The scientific name of the brook trout is &quot;Salvelinus fontinalis&quot;. Initially, the brook trout was scientifically described as &quot;Salmo fontinalis&quot; by the naturalist Samuel Latham Mitchill in 1814. The species was later moved to the char genus &quot;Salvelinus&quot;, which in North America also includes the lake trout, bull trout, Dolly Varden, and the Arctic char. The specific epithet &quot;fontinalis&quot; comes from the Latin for &quot;of a spring or fountain&quot;, in reference to the clear, cold streams and ponds in its native habitat.

===Subspecies===
There is little recognized systematic substructure in the brook trout, but the two subspecies have been proposed. The aurora trout (&quot;S. f. timagamiensis&quot;) is a subspecies native to two lakes in the Temagami District of Ontario, Canada. The silver trout (&quot;S. agassizii&quot; or &quot;S. f. agassizii)&quot; is an extinct trout species or subspecies last seen in Dublin Pond, New Hampshire, in 1930. It is considered by fisheries biologist Robert J. Behnke as a highly specialized form of brook trout.

===Hybrids===

The brook trout produces hybrids both with its congeners the lake trout (S.&quot; namaycush&quot;) and the Arctic char (&quot;S. alpinus&quot;), and intergeneric hybrids with the brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;).

The splake is an intrageneric hybrid between the brook trout and lake trout (&quot;S. namaycush&quot;). Although uncommon in nature, they are artificially propagated in substantial numbers for stocking into brook trout or lake trout habitats. Although they are fertile, back-crossing in nature is behaviorally problematic and very little natural reproduction occurs. Splake grow more quickly than brook trout, become piscivorous sooner, and are more tolerant of competitors than brook trout.

The tiger trout is an intergeneric hybrid between the brook trout and the brown trout. Tiger trout rarely occur naturally but are sometimes artificially propagated. Such crosses are almost always reproductively sterile. They are popular with many fish-stocking programs because they can grow quickly, and may help keep coarse fish (wild non &quot;sport&quot; fish) populations in check due to their highly piscivorous (fish-eating) nature.

The sparctic char is an intrageneric hybrid between the brook trout and the Arctic char.

== Ecological forms ==
The US Forest Service has recognized two ecological forms of brook trout, salters and coasters. The forms express the same general features but vary in size, behavior, and location.

=== Coasters ===
A potamodromous population of brook trout native to lacustrine regions, which migrate into tributary rivers to spawn, are called &quot;coasters&quot;. Coasters tend to be larger than most other populations of brook trout, often reaching 6 to 7 lb (2.7 to 3.2 kg) in size. They also commonly live for longer periods of time and exhibit more predacious behavior than their counterparts. Many coaster populations have been severely reduced by overfishing and habitat loss by the construction of hydroelectric power dams on Lake Superior tributaries. In Ontario, Michigan, and Minnesota efforts are underway to restore and recover coaster populations.

=== Salters ===
When Europeans first settled in Eastern North America, semi-anadromous or sea-run brook trout, commonly called &quot;salters&quot;, ranged from southern New Jersey, north throughout the Canadian maritime provinces, and west to Hudson Bay. Salters are a short-lived form of brook trout that inhabit smaller bodies of water and exhibit less predacious behavior than coasters. They may spend up to three months at sea feeding on crustaceans, fish, and marine worms in the spring. During this time they won&#x27;t stray more than a few miles from the river mouth, but then return to freshwater tributaries to spawn in the late summer or autumn. While in saltwater, salters gain a more silvery color, losing much of the distinctive markings seen in freshwater. However, within two weeks of returning to freshwater, they assume typical brook trout color and markings. Salters have faced threats such as habitat destruction, water pollution, and water way damming that have led to their declining population numbers across the Northeastern United States.

==Description==
The brook trout has a dark green to brown color, with a distinctive marbled pattern (called vermiculation) of lighter shades across the flanks and back and extending at least to the dorsal fin, and often to the tail. A distinctive sprinkling of red dots, surrounded by blue halos, occurs along the flanks. The belly and lower fins are reddish in color, the latter with white leading edges. Often, the belly, particularly of the males, becomes very red or orange when the fish are spawning. Typical lengths of the brook trout vary from , and weights from . The maximum recorded length is and maximum weight . Brook trout can reach at least seven years of age, with reports of 15-year-old specimens observed in California habitats to which the species has been introduced. Growth rates are dependent on season, age, water and ambient air temperatures, and flow rates. In general, flow rates affect the rate of change in the relationship between temperature and growth rate. For example, in spring, growth increased with temperature at a faster rate with high flow rates than with low flow rates.

==Range and habitat==
Brook trout are native to a wide area of Eastern North America, but are increasingly confined to higher elevations southward in the Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia and northwest South Carolina, Canada from the Hudson Bay basin east, the Great Lakes–Saint Lawrence system, the Canadian maritime provinces, and the upper Mississippi River drainage as far west as eastern Iowa. Their southern historic native range has been drastically reduced, with fish being restricted to higher-elevation, remote streams due to habitat loss and introductions of brown and rainbow trout. As early as 1850, the brook trout&#x27;s range started to extend west from its native range through introductions. The brook trout was eventually introduced into suitable habitats throughout the western U.S. during the late 19th and early 20th centuries at the behest of the American Acclimatization Society and by private, state, and federal fisheries authorities. Acclimatization movements in Europe, South America, and Oceania resulted in brook trout introductions throughout Europe, in Argentina, and New Zealand. Although not all introductions were successful, a great many established wild, self-sustaining populations of brook trout in non-native waters.

===Habitat===

The brook trout inhabits large and small lakes, rivers, streams, creeks, and spring ponds in cold temperate climates with mild precipitation. Clear spring water with adequate cover and moderate flow rates is indicative of strong habitability for brook trout. They exhibit high levels of adaptability when exposed to habitat changes from environmental effects, and have been observed to exhibit more resilience to habitat change than other &quot;Salvelinus&quot; species. The typical pH range of brook trout waters is 5.0 to 7.5, with pH extremes of 3.5 to 9.8 possible. Water temperatures typically range from . Warm summer temperatures and low flow rates are stressful on brook trout populations—especially larger fish.

==Ecology and reproduction==

===Diet===
Brook trout have a diverse diet that includes larval, pupal, adult forms of aquatic insects (typically caddisflies, stoneflies, mayflies, and aquatic dipterans), adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers, and crickets) that fall into the water, crustaceans, frogs and other amphibians, molluscs, smaller fish, invertebrates, and even small aquatic mammals such as voles and sometimes other young brook trout.

===Reproduction===
The female constructs a depression in a location in the stream bed, sometimes referred to as a &quot;redd&quot;, where groundwater percolates upward through the gravel. One or more males approach the female, fertilizing the eggs as the female expresses them. Most spawning involve peripheral males, which directly influences the number of eggs that survive into adulthood. In general, the larger the number of peripheral males present, the more likely the eggs will be cannibalized. The eggs are slightly denser than water. The female then buries the eggs in a small gravel mound where they hatch in 4 to 6 weeks.

== Life cycle ==
Following the deposition of up to 5,000 eggs in gravel beds by the female brook trout, the eggs enter an incubation period from the winter months to early spring. During this incubation period, the eggs source oxygen from the stream that passes through the gravel beds and into their gel-like shells. The eggs will then successively hatch into miniature fry that rely upon their yolk sac for nutrients to compensate for the lack of nutrients provided by the parental trout during the early stages of development. In the ensuing stage of their life cycle, the fry will seek cover from predatory species in rock crevices and inlets. During this period of hiding, the trout will begin to mature into fingerlings by summer and start expressing parr marks to aid in camouflage. At this point, most brook trout will be between 2 and 3 inches in length. Finally, in succeeding months, the trout will fully mature into a trout that is approximately between 10 and 34 inches long and capable of spawning in the fall months. These fully developed adult brook trout will express a vibrant olive-green back, cherry red underbelly, black accented fins, and wavy dorsal patterns. A typical adult brook trout will live to the age of 3 to 4 years old, with occasional brooks living to over the age of 4.
==Angling==
The brook trout is a popular game fish with anglers, particularly fly fishermen. 
 Until it was displaced by introduced brown trout (1883) and rainbow trout (1875), the brook trout attracted the most attention of anglers from colonial times through the first 100 years of U.S. history. Sporting writers such as Genio Scott &quot;Fishing in American Waters&quot; (1869), Thaddeus Norris &quot;American Anglers Book&quot; (1864), Robert Barnwell Roosevelt &quot;Game Fish of North America&quot; (1864) and Charles Hallock &quot;The Fishing Tourist&quot; (1873) produced guides to the best-known brook trout waters in America. As brook trout populations declined in the mid-19th century near urban areas, anglers flocked to the Adirondacks in upstate New York and the Rangeley lakes region in Maine to pursue brook trout. In July 1916 on the Nipigon River in northern Ontario, an Ontario physician, John W. Cook, caught a brook trout, which stands as the world record.
Today, many anglers practice catch-and-release tactics to preserve remaining populations. Organizations such as Trout Unlimited have been at the forefront of efforts to institute air and water quality standards sufficient to protect the brook trout. Revenues derived from the sale of fishing licenses have been used to restore many sections of creeks and streams to brook trout habitat.

=== Record ===
The current world angling record brook trout was caught by Dr. W. J. Cook on the Nipigon River, Ontario, in July 1915. The trout weighed only because, at the time of weighing, it was badly decomposed after 21 days in the bush without refrigeration. A brook trout, caught in October 2006 in Manitoba, is not eligible for record status since it was released alive. This trout weighed about based on the accepted formula for calculating weight by measurements, and it currently stands as the record brook trout for Manitoba.

==Artificial propagation and aquaculture==

Since the 1800s, brook trout populations have been grown by artificial propagation and aquaculture. Artificial propagation in fish is the process by which eggs are inseminated, hatched, and grown in a controlled environment that minimizes unfavorable environmental pressures. The fish are then released into the wild when they have reached the appropriate age and size. This process was introduced as a way to counteract the effects of overfishing and aquatic habitat loss and to reinforce brook trout populations across the Northeastern United States. Hatchery rearing was also introduced to raise brook trout in large numbers for food production and sale for human consumption.

The process of artificial propagation in brook trout begins by decreasing the temperature of the adult trout&#x27;s propagation tank to mimic the seasonal changes associated with brook trout spawning season. The acclimated trout are then collected, and the eggs are gently massaged out of the female trout into a collection vessel, and then inseminated with the milt of a male brook. Next, the inseminated eggs are strained of the milt and transferred to a jar for several weeks to develop into viable embryos. Once the eggs have begun to hatch, the fry are transported into rearing tanks where they will grow and develop before their release into the wild. Their rearing tanks typically consist of large circular tanks with a constant water flow going through them to allow a current to circulate through the tank and keep it clean (some more elaborate systems operate on a re-circulation system where the water is filtered and reused). The fish are typically fed a pelleted food consisting of 40–50% protein and 15% fat made from fish oil, animal protein, plant protein and vitamins and minerals. Finally, once the fish have reached a viable size, around 2 inches in length, they are released into the wild.

This means of brook trout aquaculture has sparked controversy due to potential decrease in the fishes fitness, adaptability, and environmental resilience, effectively posing a threat to native brook trout populations. Arguments against artificial propagation of brook trout claim that it can cause a degradation of the overall genetic pool due to the possibility of inbreeding among individuals. This lack of genetic variation could lead to certain populations of brook trout to become extirpated from their deficiency in adaptability.

==Conservation status==
As early as the late 19th century, native brook trout in North America became extirpated from many watercourses as land development, forest clear-cutting, and industrialization took hold. Streams and creeks that were polluted, dammed, or silted up often became too warm to hold native brook trout, and were colonized by transplanted smallmouth bass and perch or other introduced salmonids such as brown and rainbow trout. The brown trout, a species not native to North America, has replaced the brook trout in much of the brook trout&#x27;s native water. If already stressed by overharvesting or by temperature, brook trout populations are very susceptible to damage by the introduction of exogenous species. Many lacustrine populations of brook trout have been extirpated by the introduction of other species, particularly percids, but sometimes other spiny-rayed fishes.

In addition to chemical pollution and algae growth caused by runoff containing chemicals and fertilizers, air pollution has also been a significant factor in the disappearance of brook trout from their native habitats. In the U.S., acid rain caused by air pollution has resulted in pH levels too low to sustain brook trout in all but the highest headwaters of some Appalachian streams and creeks. Brook trout populations across large parts of eastern Canada have been similarly challenged; a subspecies known as the aurora trout was extirpated from the wild by the effects of acid rain.

Organizations such as Trout Unlimited and Trout Unlimited Canada are partnering with other organizations such as the Southern Appalachian Brook Trout Foundation, the Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture, and state, provincial, and federal agencies to undertake projects that restore native brook trout habitat and populations.

===As an invasive species===
Although brook trout populations are under stress in their native range, they are considered an invasive species where they have been introduced outside their historic native range. In the northern Rocky Mountains, non-native brook trout are considered a significant contributor to the decline or extirpation of native cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarki&quot;) in headwater streams. Invasive brook trout populations may provoke territorial competition with the native cutthroat trout that can impede the recovery efforts of cutthroat trout by environmental agencies. Non-native brook trout populations have been subject to eradication programs in efforts to preserve native species. In Yellowstone National Park, anglers may take an unlimited number of non-native brook trout in some watersheds. In the Lamar River watershed, a mandatory kill regulation for any brook trout caught is in effect. In Europe, introduced brook trout, once established, have had negative impacts on growth rates of native brown trout (&quot;S. trutta&quot;).

<text>Brian Patrick Dawkins Sr. (born October 13, 1973), nicknamed &quot;Weapon X&quot;, is an American former professional football player who was a safety for 16 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the Philadelphia Eagles. He played college football for the Clemson Tigers and was selected by the Eagles in the second round of the 1996 NFL draft. In his last three seasons, he played for the Denver Broncos.

Regarded as one of the greatest safeties of all time, Dawkins was viewed as the leader of the Eagles defense, named to nine Pro Bowls and five All-Pro teams during his career. He also made one Super Bowl appearance with the Eagles in XXXIX, which was played in his home city of Jacksonville, Florida. In addition to his playing career, Dawkins served the Eagles as an executive of football operations for player development from 2016 to 2018 and was with the organization when they won Super Bowl LII. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018.

==High school and college career==

Dawkins graduated from William M. Raines High School in Jacksonville, Florida in 1992. He played both football and basketball in high school, and helped lead the basketball team to a Class 3A championship. Dawkins was not highly recruited out of high school, but received a scholarship offer from Clemson University at the request of his high school teammate, Patrick Sapp.

Dawkins was a three-year starter at free safety for the Clemson Tigers football team, finishing his career with 247 tackles and 11 interceptions. He received first-team All-ACC Honors in 1995 and was selected by the Associated Press and &quot;Sporting News&quot; as a second-team All-American as a senior when his team-high six interceptions tied him for the conference lead. He was named the first-team strong safety on Clemson&#x27;s all-centennial team in 1996 and was selected to their Athletic Hall of Fame in 2009. On January 11, 2013, Clemson University established the Brian Dawkins Lifetime Achievement Award to annually honor a former Clemson player for their performance on the field, contributions in leadership and community service.

On February 28, 2009, the Denver Broncos signed Dawkins to a five-year, $17 million contract that included $7.2 million guaranteed. He joined another teammate, Correll Buckhalter, who also signed with the Broncos. The contract also included a termination clause that permitted Dawkins to opt out of the contract after two years and receives an extra $1.8 million, virtually making the contract for two years and $9 million. Dawkins could have also earned an additional $10 million in performance incentives. The Philadelphia Eagles and Dawkins were discussing a possible two-year contract before Dawkins received interest from the Denver Broncos.

Head coach Josh McDaniels named Dawkins the starting free safety to begin the regular season, alongside strong safety Renaldo Hill and cornerbacks Champ Bailey and Andre Goodman. In Week 10, he collected a season-high 14 combined tackles (12 solo) during a 27–17 loss at the Washington Redskins.

He started all 16 games in 2009 and recorded 116 combined tackles (95 solo), 11 pass deflections, two interceptions, and a forced fumble. Following the 2009 season, Dawkins was named to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team as a first team safety alongside Ed Reed; the second team safety group consisted of Darren Sharper and future Hall of Famer Troy Polamalu.

====2010====
On January 18, 2010, the Denver Broncos mutually parted ways with defensive coordinator Mike Nolan. They promoted linebackers coach Don Martindale to defensive coordinator. Head coach Josh McDaniels elected to retain the starting secondary in 2009. Dawkins was sidelined for two games (Weeks 6–7) due to a knee injury. He further aggravated his knee injury and was inactive for another three games (Weeks 13–15). On December 7, 2009, the Denver Broncos fired head coach Josh McDaniels after they fell to a 3–9 record. In Week 16, he collected a season-high nine combined tackles and deflected a pass during a 24–23 win against the Houston Texans. He finished the season with 66 combined tackles (55 solo), five pass deflections, two sacks, and an interception in 11 games and 11 starts.

Head coach John Fox named Dawkins the starting strong safety to begin the regular season, alongside free safety Rahim Moore. He started in the Denver Broncos&#x27; season-opener against the Oakland Raiders and collected a season-high nine combined tackles in their 23–20 loss. On October 23, 2011, Dawkins made five combined tackles and two sacks during an 18–15 win at the Miami Dolphins in Week 7.

On January 19, 2012, it was announced that Dawkins would play in the 2012 Pro Bowl as a late injury replacement for Pittsburgh Steelers&#x27; safety Troy Polamalu.

===Retirement===
After calling Coach John Fox on April 23, 2012, Dawkins announced via Twitter that he was retiring from the NFL. His reasoning was he wanted to retire while he was still healthy. He planned to stay in Colorado, and wanted to begin coaching high school football that fall.

On April 28, 2012, Dawkins alongside Jeffrey Lurie announced that he would sign a one-day contract, and retire as a member of the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles retired Dawkins&#x27; number 20 in a ceremony at half-time of their September 30 game against the New York Giants. The Eagles have retired only nine players&#x27; jerseys in franchise history, which goes back more than 80 years.

===Hall of Fame===
On February 4, 2018, it was announced that Dawkins was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and was one of five players selected. Dawkins joined Randy Moss, Brian Urlacher, Ray Lewis, and former Eagles teammate Terrell Owens.
On August 4, 2018, Dawkins was officially inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and attended the ceremony at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. He was the first former Clemson player to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

===Legacy===
Over the span of his career, Dawkins developed a reputation as a ball-hawking safety and became the unquestioned leader of the Philadelphia Eagles&#x27; defense. He earned the nickname &quot;Weapon X,&quot; a codename of Marvel character Wolverine, the comic book superhero known for relentless aggression. He emerged as one of the top safeties in the league and was a defensive captain for the majority of his stints with both the Philadelphia Eagles and Denver Broncos. Dawkins is considered to be one of the top safeties in NFL history and was ranked as the fifth best safety in NFL history by NFL analyst Gil Brandt.

As a captain and unquestioned leader, Dawkins has acted as a mentor to multiple players early in their career, including Al Harris, Chris Harris Jr., Jason Avant, and Quintin Mikell. Chris Harris Jr. credits Dawkins and Champ Bailey for urging the Denver Broncos&#x27; coaching staff to play him as an undrafted rookie after he showed promise and performed well in practice squad.

==Post-playing career==

On September 5, 2012, it was announced that Dawkins was hired as an NFL studio analyst by ESPN.

On July 30, 2016, Dawkins returned to the Eagles to take a role on the team&#x27;s scouting staff. On August 17, 2016, Dawkins was given the new role of Football Operations Executive to assist with player development.

On May 22, 2018, Dawkins resigned as Football Operations Executive to seek other opportunities.

==Personal life==

Dawkins was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida. In an interview, Dawkins talked about getting married: &quot;I went to college at Clemson, and she (Connie) transferred there my second year, after one year at Jacksonville University. The night before going back to school our junior year, I asked her to marry me. Her grandfather gave us $100. Fifty-nine dollars for my ring and $41 for hers—and we eloped. We went to the Justice of the Peace.&quot; He first saw his future wife, Connie Kerrin, in junior high school and began dating her while attending William M. Raines High School; she was a majorette while he played football and basketball. They graduated in 1992. In early 2007, Dawkins and his wife had twin daughters, Chonni and Cionni. Both daughters were born two months premature but are now both perfectly healthy. Dawkins, with his wife, Connie, also have two other children, Brian Jr. and Brionni. Brian Jr. played for the Clemson Tigers as a cornerback. After eloping in 1994, the couple had a wedding ceremony with family and friends at the Palm Beach Breakers Hotel in July 2009.

Dawkins is a Christian. Dawkins has said that his Christian faith has helped against depression and suicidal thoughts. During his NFL Hall of Fame speech, Dawkins said, &quot;Thank you, Heavenly Father. Thank you, Heavenly Father, for blessing me with the sense to understand that I did not do everything by myself ... You have guided me the whole way, orchestrated my life ... You stayed faithful to me, and I cannot wait to see what You&#x27;re going to do with me next.&quot;

While with the Eagles, Dawkins had been a resident of Voorhees Township, New Jersey, but put his house there up for sale after joining the Broncos.

After Dawkins signed with the Broncos in 2009, Dan Leone, an Eagles employee who was a gate chief at Lincoln Financial Field was fired by the Eagles after Leone posted messages on his Facebook page expressing his disappointment in the team. Dawkins announced that he would give his two allotted game tickets for the 2009 Eagles-Broncos game to Leone, saying, &quot;I felt it would be a good thing, to reach out to that individual and just let him know how much I appreciate it.&quot;

Dawkins&#x27; nephew, Dalyn Dawkins played for Colorado State and was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Tennessee Titans.

In April 2019, it was announced that Wawa and Dawkins teamed up to create a hoagie called &quot;The Dawk&quot;. It has grilled chicken, Parmesan cheese, spinach, tomato, pickles, sweet peppers, and yellow mustard. It was available for a limited time and only at the Wawa in Dawkins&#x27;s hometown of Jacksonville, Florida.

<text>Joachim &quot;Jim&quot; Lambek (5 December 1922 – 23 June 2014) was a Canadian mathematician. He was Peter Redpath Emeritus Professor of Pure Mathematics at McGill University, where he earned his PhD degree in 1950 with Hans Zassenhaus as advisor.

== Biography ==
Lambek was born in Leipzig, Germany, where he attended a Gymnasium. He came to England in 1938 as a refugee on the &quot;Kindertransport&quot;. From there he was interned as an enemy alien and deported to a prison work camp in New Brunswick, Canada. There, he began in his spare time a mathematical apprenticeship with Fritz Rothberger, also
interned, and wrote the McGill Junior Matriculation in fall of 1941. In the spring of 1942, he was released and settled in Montreal, where he entered studies at McGill University, graduating with an honours mathematics degree in 1945 and an MSc a year later. In 1950, he completed his doctorate under Hans Zassenhaus becoming McGill&#x27;s first PhD in mathematics.

Lambek became assistant professor at McGill; he was made a full professor in 1963. He spent his sabbatical year 1965–66 in at the Institute for Mathematical Research at ETH Zurich, where Beno Eckmann had gathered together a group of researchers interested in algebraic topology and category theory, including Bill Lawvere. There Lambek reoriented his research into category theory.

Lambek retired in 1992 but continued his involvement at McGill&#x27;s mathematics department. In 2000 a festschrift celebrating Lambek&#x27;s contributions to mathematical structures in computer science was published. On the occasion of Lambek&#x27;s 90th birthday, a collection &quot;Categories and Types in Logic, Language, and Physics&quot; was produced in tribute to him.

== Scholarly work ==
Lambek&#x27;s PhD thesis investigated vector fields using the biquaternion algebra over Minkowski space, as well as semigroup immersion in a group. The second component was published by the Canadian Journal of Mathematics. He later returned to biquaternions when in 1995 he contributed &quot;If Hamilton had prevailed: Quaternions in Physics&quot;, which exhibited the Riemann–Silberstein bivector to express the free-space electromagnetic equations.

Lambek supervised 17 doctoral students, and has 75 doctoral descendants as of 2020. He has over 100 publications listed in the Mathematical Reviews, including 6 books. His earlier work was mostly in module theory, especially torsion theories, non-commutative localization, and injective modules. One of his earliest papers, , proved the Lambek–Moser theorem about integer sequences. In 1963 he published an important result, now known as Lambek&#x27;s theorem, on character modules characterizing flatness of a module. His more recent work is in pregroups and formal languages; his earliest works in this field were probably and . He is noted, among other things, for the Lambek calculus, an effort to capture mathematical aspects of natural language syntax in logical form, and a work that has been very influential in computational linguistics, as well as for developing the connections between typed lambda calculus and cartesian closed categories (see Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence). His last works were on pregroup grammar.

<doc id="1250505" wikidata="Q6744080" url="?curid=1250505" title="Mallard BASIC">
<text>Mallard BASIC is a BASIC interpreter for CP/M produced by Locomotive Software and supplied with the Amstrad PCW range of small business computers, the ZX Spectrum +3 version of CP/M Plus, and the Acorn BBC Micro&#x27;s Zilog Z80  second processor.

In the 1980s, it was standard industry practice to bundle a BASIC interpreter with microcomputers, and the PCW followed this practice. While the PCW was primarily a dedicated word processor for business use running LocoScript, it was running on top of the CP/M operating system.

There were many existing implementations of BASIC for CP/M, such as Digital Research&#x27;s CBASIC and the third-party ZBasic, but they followed the earlier 1970s model of compilers that were fed source code prepared in a separate text editor. BASIC was not built-in in these cases, the user would prepare a program and then invoke BASIC to run it.

In contrast, home computers of the era had moved to using BASIC as the primary interface for the machine. Instead of booting into CP/M or a similar OS, these machines booted directly into a BASIC normally stored on ROM. These also included a built-in screen editor. Mallard was based on this model, with an integrated editor that was tailored for the PCW&#x27;s non-standard 90-column screen.

Although the PCW actually had excellent monochrome graphics support for its time and specification, closely comparable to the Hercules Graphics Card for IBM PC compatible computers, Mallard BASIC had no graphics support whatsoever. Instead, Locomotive Software optimised it for business use, with, for instance, full ISAM random-access file support, making it easier to write database applications.

It was also optimised for speed — it is named after the LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard locomotive, the fastest steam locomotive in the world, once again displaying the company&#x27;s fondness for railway-oriented nomenclature. In fact, the Locomotive Software name came from the phrase &quot;to run like a train&quot; and it was this theme that was used to name Mallard BASIC — no other Locomotive Software product was named after anything railway-oriented.

The Acorn version was designed simply to run the Compact Software small business accounting products Acorn was including to target its Z80 second processor at small businesses. Mallard&#x27;s major innovation designed specifically for Acorn was the addition of the Jetsam B*-tree keyed access filing system to give similar (but superior) features to the Miksam product Compact had originally designed around.

Graphics could be implemented by loading the GSX extension to CP/M, but this was cumbersome for BASIC programmers.

The lack of graphics support was rectified by several BASIC toolkits, of which the most popular was Lightning Extended BASIC (LEB — see external links). This patched Mallard BASIC, replacing the redundant codice_1 keyword with codice_2, which could be followed by a wide variety of parameters to allow sophisticated graphics (for the time) to be drawn on screen, saved to disc, printed, and so on.

Probably the most widespread Mallard application ever was RPED, the text editor supplied with the PCW. The name was short for Roland Perry&#x27;s EDitor, the program having been quickly written by Roland Perry, the Amstrad executive running the computer product development, when it was realised that CP/M-80 came with no usable full-screen editor, but users had a requirement to edit configuration files. The same problem was apparent with DOS Plus and MS-DOS supplied with IBM-compatible Amstrad computers, but the RPED for those machines was written in Intel 8086 assembler, and not Mallard BASIC.

The IBM PC version of Mallard Basic is still available from LocoScript Software as an MS-DOS program, which will run under Windows as a disc-only version with licence or with the full Introduction &amp; Reference manual.

<doc id="1250506" wikidata="Q335685" url="?curid=1250506" title="Atlantic voyage of the predecessor of Mansa Musa">
<text>In 1324, while staying in Cairo during his hajj, Mansa Musa, the ruler of the Mali Empire, told an Egyptian official whom he had befriended that he had come to rule when his predecessor led a large fleet in an attempt to cross the Atlantic Ocean and never returned. This account, recorded by the Arab historian al-Umari, has attracted considerable interest and speculation as a possible instance of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. The voyage is popularly attributed to a Mansa Abu Bakr II, but no such mansa ever reigned. Rather, the voyage is inferred to have been undertaken by Mansa Muhammad ibn Qu.

A precise date for the suggested voyage is not known, though it is interpreted as having occurred in or shortly before 1312, the year Musa is inferred to have become mansa. No clear evidence of the fate of the voyage or even its existence has ever been found.

==Musa&#x27;s account==

Mansa Musa stayed in Cairo for three months in 1324 while en route to Mecca for the hajj. While there, he befriended an emir named Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Amir Hajib, who was the governor of the district of Cairo Musa was staying in. Ibn Amir Hajib later relayed to the scholar al-Umari what he had learned of Mali from his conversations with Musa. In one such conversation, Ibn Amir Hajib had asked Musa how he had become king, and Musa responded:

Al-Umari’s record of this conversation is the only known account of this voyage, as it is not mentioned by other medieval Arab historians or West African oral tradition. Nonetheless, the possibility of such a voyage has been taken seriously by several historians.

==Identity of Musa&#x27;s predecessor==

The identity of the mansa responsible for the voyage has been subject to some confusion. Al-Umari’s record of Musa’s account does not mention the mansa’s name, the only indication of his identity is that he was Musa’s predecessor. According to the Arab historian Ibn Khaldun, writing several decades later, Musa’s predecessor as mansa was Muhammad ibn Qu. As such, several historians have attributed the voyage to Mansa Muhammad.

Many sources call the mansa in question Abu Bakr II. However, the inclusion of a Mansa Abu Bakr II in the list of Malian rulers is an error that originated in a mistranslation of Ibn Khaldun’s text by the 19th-century European historian Baron de Slane. De Slane translated Ibn Khaldun as saying that the kingship passed from Muhammad to Abu Bakr, then to Musa. However, in the original Arabic text, Abu Bakr is only mentioned in his role as the progenitor of Musa&#x27;s lineage, not as a ruler. The Abu Bakr in question was a brother of Sunjata, the founder of the Mali Empire, and apparently never himself ruled. Another figure named Abu Bakr did rule as mansa, but he was the predecessor of Sakura, not Musa.

Additionally, some historians have suggested without elaboration that the voyage should be attributed to Mansa Qu, who was the father and predecessor of Muhammad ibn Qu according to Ibn Khaldun.

==Interpretation==

No uncontroversial evidence of pre-Columbian contact between Africa and the Americas has ever been found. Regardless of whether any of the Malian ships ever reached the Americas, they apparently never returned to Africa and there were not any long-term economic consequences of the voyage.

The river on the sea described by the survivor of the first expedition is presumably the Canary Current. The inclusion of this fact in Musa&#x27;s account indicates that Musa had some awareness of the oceanographic conditions of the open Atlantic. The Canary Current flows from West Africa to the Americas, which would have facilitated travel from Africa to the Americas but prevented it in the opposite direction.

Ivan van Sertima and Malian researcher Gaoussou Diawara proposed that the voyage reached the New World. Van Sertima cites the abstract of Columbus&#x27;s log made by Bartolomé de las Casas, according to which the purpose of Columbus&#x27;s third voyage was to test both the claims of King John II of Portugal that &quot;canoes had been found which set out from the coast of Guinea [West Africa] and sailed to the west with merchandise&quot; as well as the claims of the native inhabitants of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola that &quot;from the south and the southeast had come black people whose spears were made of a metal called guanín ... from which it was found that of 32 parts: 18 were gold, 6 were silver, and 8 copper.&quot;

However, scholars dispute evidence of any such voyage reaching the Americas, and that there are insufficient evidentiary grounds to suppose there has been contact between Africa and the New World at any point in the pre-Columbian era. Haslip-Viera et al. noted in particular that &quot;no genuine African artifact has ever been found in a controlled archaeological excavation in the New World&quot;. Karl Taube, a professor at UC Riverside specializing in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican history writes there &quot;simply is no material evidence of any Pre-Hispanic contact between the Old World and Mesoamerica before the arrival of the Spanish in the sixteenth century&quot;.

==Legacy==

Mansa Musa himself appears to have considered his predecessor&#x27;s plan to be impractical. The main point he appears to have been trying to make to Ibn Amir Hajib is that his predecessor&#x27;s failed voyage paved the way to his becoming king. Likewise, it has been speculated that the lack of information in oral tradition about the voyage reflects a view that the mansa&#x27;s voyage was a shameful abdication of duty.

In modern times, the voyage has become more celebrated. The Malian historian Gaoussou Diawara has remarked that the mansa should be looked up to by modern politicians as an example of a ruler who valued science and discovery over holding onto power.

<doc id="1250509" wikidata="Q73768" url="?curid=1250509" title="Marius Goring">
<text>Marius Re Goring (23 May 191230 September 1998) was an English stage and screen actor. He is best remembered for the four films he made with Powell &amp; Pressburger, particularly as Conductor 71 in &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; and as Julian Craster in &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. He is also known for playing the titular role in the long-running TV drama series, &quot;The Expert&quot;. He regularly performed French and German roles, and was frequently cast in the latter because of his name, coupled with his red-gold hair and blue eyes. However, in a 1965 interview, he explained that he was not of German descent, stating that &quot;Goring is a completely English name.&quot;

==Life and career==
Goring was born in Newport, Isle of Wight, the son of the eminent physician and researcher Dr Charles Buckman Goring (1870-1919), the author of &quot;The English Convict&quot;, and Kate Winifred (née Macdonald, 1874–1964), a professional pianist of Scottish descent who was also a suffragette. He had an older brother, Donald, who died in Yemen, in 1936, from injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. After attending The Perse School in Cambridge, where he became a friend of an older boy, the future documentary film maker Humphrey Jennings, Goring studied modern languages at the universities of Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna and Paris. Encouraged by both of his parents to pursue his acting ambitions, he made his professional debut in 1927 playing Harlequin. He studied under Harcourt Williams at the Old Vic dramatic school from 1929 to 1932. In 1931, he toured Germany and France with the English Classical Players performing in Shakespearean and classic English plays. Having become fluent in French and German, he joined La Compagnie des Quinze, under the directorship of Michel Saint-Denis, in 1934. He would later encourage Saint-Denis to come to England and work as a director. His early stage career in England included appearances at the Old Vic, Sadler&#x27;s Wells and in the West End from 1932 through to 1940. During that period, he played a variety of Shakespearean roles at the Old Vic, including the title role in &quot;Macbeth&quot; and Romeo in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1933), Feste in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1937), in addition to Trip in Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;. He first worked in the West End in a 1934 revival of Granville-Barker&#x27;s &quot;The Voysey Inheritance&quot; at the Shaftesbury Theatre.

In 1929, he became a founding member of British Equity, the actors&#x27; union, served on its council from 1949 and was three times its vice-president from 1963 to 1965, 1975 to 1977 and again from 1980 to 1982. Goring&#x27;s relationship with his union was fraught with conflict: he took it to litigation on three occasions. In 1978, regarding the issue of the supremacy of a referendum to decide Equity rules, he took it as far as the House of Lords and won his case. In 1992, he unsuccessfully sought to end the restriction on the sale of radio and television programmes to apartheid South Africa. Stressing that he opposed apartheid and would not perform for segregated audiences, he argued that the ban was depriving actors of work, and stated that he wished to stage a production of the play &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; with an all-black cast. This particular litigation nearly bankrupted him, due to heavy court costs.

In November 1931, at the age of nineteen, he married twenty-nine year old Mary Westwood Steel (1902-1994) at Gretna Green, Scotland (they had a second marriage ceremony in a London register office in February 1932) and their only child, a daughter Phyllida Mariette Goring, was born in March 1932 and died in 2018. The marriage did not succeed and he became engaged in 1935 to ballet choreographer and designer, Susan &#x27;Susy&#x27; Salaman, older sister of Merula Salaman, wife of Alec Guinness. Susy contracted acute encephalitis in late 1935 and was left brain-damaged. Goring wanted to go ahead with the wedding but Susy&#x27;s father, Michel Salaman, would not allow it.

In 1935, he co-founded the London Theatre Studio with Michel Saint-Denis, George Devine and Glen Byam Shaw. It trained actors, directors and designers and was a precursor of the Old Vic Theatre School; Goring taught Shakespeare there. It had to close in late 1939 due to the outbreak of war.
 

Goring&#x27;s film career began with an uncredited role in &quot;The Amateur Gentleman&quot; (1936) with Douglas Fairbanks Jr and a small speaking role in &quot;Rembrandt&quot; (also 1936). He shared his one scene in this film with the star Charles Laughton, with whom he had previously worked on stage at the Old Vic. He made two further films released in 1939: &quot;Flying Fifty-Five&quot; with Derrick de Marney where he showed off his comedic skills playing an amusing drunkard and co-starred with Conrad Veidt in his first Powell and Pressburger film, &quot;The Spy in Black&quot;, an intriguing spy thriller set during World War One, where he played a German officer for the first of many times in his film career.

When war was declared in September 1939, he was back in the West End as Pip in a production of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, adapted for the stage by Alec Guinness. Along with all other plays, it was closed down temporarily by the war but was the first to resume when theatres were reopened in early 1940. He joined the British Army in June 1940, and was seconded in 1941 to the BBC as supervisor of radio productions broadcasting to Germany as part of the BBC German Service (Londoner Rundfunk). He made broadcasts under the name Charles Richardson (using his father&#x27;s first name and maternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name), because of the association of his name with Hermann Göring. In 1944 he became a member of the intelligence staff of SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force) where he attained the rank of colonel. Because of the broadcasts he had been making to Germany, set up by the Foreign Office as a counter to William Joyce (Lord Haw-Haw), he was put on a Nazi hit-list.

In 1941, he married his second wife, the German actress Lucie Mannheim (1899-1976). Mannheim, who was Jewish, had been a principal actress in the Berlin Theatre but had to leave Germany when the Nazis came to power. She worked with Goring in many stage productions from the 1930s onwards and in seven episodes of &quot;The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, one of which he wrote especially for her, as well as in several films. Mannheim died in 1976, and the next year Goring married television director/producer Prudence Fitzgerald (1930-2018), who had directed him in many episodes of &quot;The Expert&quot;.

In the film &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946) Goring played Conductor 71, whose role is to &#x27;conduct&#x27; Peter Carter (David Niven) to the afterlife. In &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, he played Julian Craster, a young composer who wins the heart of ballerina Vicky Page (Moira Shearer) and clashes with the imperious ballet impresario, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook). In the film &quot;Odette&quot; released in the UK in 1950, Goring played the role of Colonel Henri, a German Abwehr (Military Intelligence) officer who deceived and captured Odette. The film is based on the true story of Odette Sansom, the first living woman to be awarded the George Cross. The real Odette Sansom was later a witness at his marriage to Prudence Fitzgerald in 1977. He played Colonel Günther von Hohensee in &quot;So Little Time&quot; (1952), which also featured Maria Schell, one of his rare romantic leads and frequent roles playing a German officer. He considered the film one of his favourites, alongside the four films he made with Powell and Pressburger.

His TV work included starring as Sir Percy Blakeney in &quot;The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (ITV, 1955) (a role which he also performed in a 1952-53 radio show), a series which he also co-wrote and produced; Theodore Maxtible in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; (BBC, 1967); Professor John Hardy in &quot;The Expert&quot; (BBC, 1968–1976); Paul von Hindenburg in &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot; (BBC, 1974); King George V in &quot;Edward &amp; Mrs. Simpson&quot; (Thames, 1980) and Emile Englander in &quot;The Old Men at the Zoo&quot; (BBC, 1983).

Goring&#x27;s voice provides the narration of the sound and light show performed regularly in the evening at the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.

He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1979 and appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1991. He died from stomach cancer in 1998 aged 86 at his home in Rushlake Green, East Sussex, survived by his third wife, Prudence and daughter, Phyllida. He is buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, Warbleton, East Sussex near Rushlake Green with his wife, Prudence, who died in 2018.

==Portrayal in fiction==
Goring appears as a character in the 2023 BBC radio play, &quot;A Wireless War&quot;, in which he is recruited by the Radio Drama Company to voice Adolf Hitler in a serial about the rise of Nazi Germany. He is played by Josh Bryant-Jones.

<text>Gabrielle Pizzi (1940 – 5 December 2004), born Gabrielle Wren, was an Australian art dealer who promoted Aboriginal art from the Western Desert from the early 1980s. She created the Gallery Gabrielle Pizzi in Melbourne in 1987.

In 1990, Gabrielle Pizzi took contemporary Aboriginal art, including that of Anatjari Tjakamarra, to the Venice Biennale and to Madrid. Pizzi curated 11 Contemporary Aboriginal Artists for the 1990 Australian Pavilion.

==Early life==
Born Gabrielle Wren in Sydney, she moved to Hobart when she was five years old. Later she moved to Melbourne as a teenager. She was the daughter of Norah and Anthony Wren; her father was one of the eight children of John Wren.

==Career==
Pizzi created Gallery Gabrielle Pizzi in 1987 in Flinders Lane, Melbourne, showing Western Desert art from Papunya Tula and Yuendumu. She held exhibitions there every three weeks for around 20 years.

She worked with art advisers from community art centres, ensuring that artists were paid correctly and new artists supported. Pizzi was known as a woman with great integrity who treated the artists with enormous respect.

Pizzi was a pioneer in the Aboriginal art world and made it her life&#x27;s mission to have Aboriginal art accepted as powerful contemporary art, and since 1990, regularly curated exhibitions of Australian Aboriginal art internationally. &quot;Australian Art Collector&quot; wrote “Pizzi stands alone among commercial dealers in her longstanding efforts to take Aboriginal art to the world&quot;, and described her as being &quot;instrumental in securing its international profile&quot;.
She brought the work of artists such as Ronnie Tjampitjinpa, Mick Namarari Tjapaltjarri and Emily Kame Kngwarreye to the world, showing Aboriginal art in exhibitions in Venice, Bangalore, Moscow, and Jerusalem. She also showed artists from Maningrida, including John Mawurndjul, James Iyuna and Jimmy An.gunguna.

Pizzi donated 21 works of Aboriginal art and fashion to the National Gallery of Victoria.

In addition to her career as an art dealer, Pizzi was an activist for animal rights and Palestinian rights in Israel.

==Death ==
Pizzi died of cancer after eighteen months&#x27; illness. She was survived by her daughter, Samantha.

<text>Grenland is a traditional district in Telemark county, in the south-east of Norway. &quot;Grenland&quot; has referred to varying locations throughout history. In modern times, Grenland refers to the areas of the municipalities of Skien, Porsgrunn, Bamble, and Siljan. Sometimes the municipalities Kragerø and Drangedal are also considered to be part of the area. The region encompasses and has 122,978 inhabitants (2004), which translates as 12% of the area and 64% of the population of Telemark.

Grenland is the core area of a slightly larger traditional district known as Nedre Telemark (&quot;Lower Telemark&quot;) which includes all of Grenland plus Midt-Telemark Municipality and the Heddal area of Notodden Municipality.

Grenland is also used as the name of an urban agglomeration consisting of the cities of Skien and Porsgrunn.

==History==
In the early Viking Age, before Harald Fairhair, Grenland was a petty kingdom. Originally &quot;Grenland&quot; was probably the name of the region surrounding the lake Norsjø in Nedre Telemark. Grenland was located within the old &quot;Grænafylket&quot; (or Grenafylket) county which contained all of Grenland plus the coastal region known as &quot;Vestmar&quot;.

&quot;Vestmar&quot; is assumed to signify the land to the west of the sea (&quot;mar&quot;), however &quot;sea&quot; in this case should be interpreted as fjord, i.e. Langesundsfjorden. Vestmar was described as a county already in the 8th century AD.

The name &quot;Grenland&quot; is derived from a people, the &quot;Grener&quot;, i.e. &quot;the land of the Grener&quot;. It is mentioned as a Gothic nation by Jordanes in his work Getica from about 551 AD: &quot;Sunt quamquam et horum positura &quot;Granii&quot;, Agadii, Eunixi, Thelae, Rugi, Harothi, Ranii.&quot; (Getica, III:24)

===20th century===
During the period of the municipality mergers in Norway, the chief administrative officer (&quot;fylkesmann&quot;) in Telemark proposed that the municipalities Skien, Solum, Gjerpen, Porsgrunn, Eidanger and Brevik be merged to form a large urban municipality centered on Skien. The municipalities had been closely integrated since the establishment of the Hydro factory at Herøya, and conurbation between the settlements was also significant.

However, the idea was opposed by Solum as well as Porsgrunn, Eidanger and Brevik and soon fell out of grace. Eidanger proposed a merger with Brevik and Porsgrunn, and the enlarged Porsgrunn municipality was finally created on 1 January 1964. Brevik lost its city status in the process. In light of this merger, the central authorities saw only one possible solution; a similar merger between Solum, Gjerpen and Skien. Unlike the first proposal, this was met by protests from Gjerpen - to no avail, as the case went to the Norwegian Parliament. The result was a significantly enlarged Skien municipality. On 1 January 1968 an area from the old Gjerpen and Solum municipalities with 3,554 inhabitants was moved to Porsgrunn.

In addition, the urban municipalities of Langesund and Stathelle were incorporated into the rural municipality of Bamble. Like Brevik, both Langesund and Stathelle lost their city status. Siljan municipality remained unaffected by the mergers, contrary to the initial expectations.

<text>Robert Keith Horry ( ; born August 25, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player and current sports commentator. Seven times a National Basketball Association (NBA) champion in his 16-season career, he is widely considered one of the greatest clutch performers and winners in NBA history.

He was given the nicknames &quot;Big Shot Rob&quot; for his clutch shooting in important games and &quot;Cheap Shot Rob&quot; for dirty play. 

Horry is one of four NBA players to win championships with three teams: two with the Houston Rockets, three with the Los Angeles Lakers, and two with the San Antonio Spurs. He holds NBA records for most steals in a Finals game and for most three-point shots made in a playoff game without a miss. 

Horry now works as a commentator on Spectrum SportsNet for the Lakers.

==Early life==
Robert Keith Horry was born on August 25, 1970, in Harford County, Maryland. Soon afterwards his father, Staff Sergeant Robert Horry Sr., divorced his mother, Leila, and moved to South Carolina. Horry grew up in Andalusia, Alabama. Later, when Robert Sr. was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia, the father and son met weekly.

As a senior at Andalusia High School, Horry won the Naismith Alabama High School Player of the Year Award.

==College career==
Horry attended the University of Alabama, where he played college basketball for Coach Wimp Sanderson, and he was a teammate of fellow future NBA player Latrell Sprewell.

At Alabama, Horry played from 1988 to 1992. He started 108 of the 133 games he played and helped the Tide win three Southeastern Conference (SEC) tournament titles and twice reached the NCAA&#x27;s Sweet 16 round. Alabama compiled a 98–36 record during his four seasons. He set a school record for career blocked shots (282). He was selected to the All-Southeastern Conference, the SEC All-Defensive and the SEC All-Academic teams. Years later, Horry returned to the university to finish his degree and graduated in spring 2021.

==Professional career==
===Houston Rockets (1992–1996)===
Horry was selected 11th overall in the 1992 NBA draft in the first round by the Houston Rockets as a small forward. He spent his first four seasons with the Rockets, helping them win the NBA championship in 1994 and 1995. He set an individual NBA Finals record with seven steals in a game. During his years with the Rockets, Horry wore number 25.

In Game 7 of the 1993 Western Conference Semifinals against the Seattle SuperSonics, he hit a jump shot with the shot clock expiring and 33 seconds left in regulation to put the Rockets up 93–91. The Rockets, however, lost in overtime and lost the series. In February 1994, he and Matt Bullard were traded to the Detroit Pistons for Sean Elliott, but Elliott failed a physical because of kidney problems, so the trade was rescinded. Horry said that the trade falling through probably saved his career. Horry went on to be a key member of the Rockets&#x27; title teams and began to build his &quot;Big Shot&quot; reputation by hitting a game-winning jumper with 6.5 seconds left in Game 1 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, then hitting a three to put Houston up 104–100 with 14.1 seconds left in a 106–103 win in Game 3 of the 1995 NBA Finals against the Orlando Magic. The Rockets went on to win Game 4 and their second championship.

Horry later said that out of his seven championship victories, this was the one he was the most proud of because the Rockets were the sixth seed in the Western Conference.

===Phoenix Suns (1996–1997)===
On August 19, 1996, Horry was traded to the Phoenix Suns, along with Sam Cassell, Chucky Brown and Mark Bryant, for former NBA Most Valuable Player Charles Barkley. Horry had been criticized in Houston for not taking enough shots and felt that was what prompted the Rockets to trade him. On January 5, 1997, he had an on-court altercation with Suns coach Danny Ainge. Horry had been performing poorly that game and had just been substituted out. He walked up to Ainge and threw a towel at his face. Horry was suspended by the Suns for two games. Suns GM Jerry Colangelo wanted to suspend Horry for longer but, at that time, the Collective Bargaining Agreement allowed a maximum of two games.

===Los Angeles Lakers (1997–2003)===
Horry was traded, along with Joe Kleine, to the Los Angeles Lakers on January 10, 1997, for Cedric Ceballos and Rumeal Robinson. Because the Lakers had retired jersey number 25 to honor Gail Goodrich, Horry wore the number 5. On May 6, 1997, he hit seven three-point shots in a row, setting the NBA record for most three-point shots made in an NBA playoff game without a miss.

During the 1999–2000 season, Horry played behind A.C. Green, but frequently played more minutes off the bench than the starters, especially during the playoffs. In the 2000 Finals against the Indiana Pacers, the Lakers took a 2–1 lead into Game 4 in Indiana. The game went into overtime. Shaquille O&#x27;Neal fouled out, but Kobe Bryant led a run to seal the Laker victory. Horry finished with 17 points in 37 minutes, his high for the Finals. The Lakers won the 2000 NBA Finals in six games. Horry averaged 7.6 points and 5.4 rebounds per game throughout the 2000 playoffs.

In the 2000–01 season, Horry played behind Horace Grant, but once again played big minutes in the playoffs. He played in 16 Lakers 2001 playoffs games, averaging 5.9 points. In the Finals, the Lakers dropped Game 1 before winning Game 2. In Game 3, in Philadelphia, he scored 12 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter, including a critical three-pointer with 47.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter to make it 92–88. He followed this with four consecutive free throws in the last 21 seconds to help seal a 96–91 Laker victory. In Game 4, Horry made three of the Lakers&#x27; 10 total three-pointers as the Lakers rolled to a 100–86 victory. The Lakers won Game 5, 108–96, to clinch their second straight championship. He has said this victory was the second-proudest of his career, after the 1995 NBA Finals.
In the 2001–02 season, he was the backup power forward to Samaki Walker, starting just 23 games. In the playoffs, Horry started 14 of the Lakers&#x27; 19 games, playing an average of 37 minutes, a game with averages of 9.3 points and 8.1 rebounds a game. Horry built his reputation for clutch play in Game 4 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals against the Sacramento Kings. Trailing two games to one in the series and facing Game 5 in Sacramento, the Lakers were down by as many as 24 points in the first half. Eventually, the Lakers cut the lead to 99–97 with 11.8 seconds to play. On the final possession, after Kobe and Shaq missed consecutive layups, Sacramento center Vlade Divac knocked the ball away from the basket in an attempt to run out the clock. However, the ball bounced right to Horry, who hit a three-pointer as time expired to win Game 4 100–99. A day later, Magic Johnson called Horry &quot;one of the 10 best clutch players in league history&quot;. The Lakers would win the series in 7 games and sweep the New Jersey Nets 4–0 in the NBA Finals to complete a three-peat. Horry started all four games in the Finals.

On March 5, 2003, Indiana Pacers center Jermaine O&#x27;Neal swatted the inside pass for Shaquille O&#x27;Neal to a wide-open Horry, who hit the game-winning shot.

In the 2003 playoffs, the Lakers were attempting to win their fourth straight NBA championship. In the closing seconds of Game 5 of the Western Conference Semifinals, Horry&#x27;s potential game-winning shot rattled in and out, putting a halt to the Lakers&#x27; rally from a 25-point deficit. The Lakers were eliminated in six games. Horry was 0-18 from the three-point line during the series.

===San Antonio Spurs (2003–2008)===
Following the 2002–03 season, Horry became a free agent. Citing concerns over family, all of whom live in Houston, he signed with the San Antonio Spurs. During the 2002–03 season, the Lakers had increased Horry&#x27;s minutes to nearly 30 a game. With the Spurs, coach Gregg Popovich cut his minutes significantly. In the 2003–04 season, the Spurs won 57 games and reached the 2004 playoffs where they swept the Memphis Grizzlies in four games, before losing in six games to the Los Angeles Lakers.

During the following season, the Spurs reached the 2005 playoffs. Horry went 38 of 85 from three-point range. In Game 5 of the 2005 NBA Finals, after only scoring three points in the first three quarters, he scored 21 of the Spurs&#x27; points in the fourth quarter and overtime. The Spurs went on to win Game 5, 96–95, after Horry hit a game-winning three-point shot with 5.9 seconds left. ESPN columnist Bill Simmons wrote, &quot;Horry&#x27;s Game 5 ranks alongside MJ&#x27;s Game 6 in 1998, Worthy&#x27;s Game 7 in 1988, Frazier&#x27;s Game 7 in 1970, and every other clutch Finals performance over the years&quot;.

During the 2007 playoffs, Horry body-checked Phoenix Suns&#x27; point guard Steve Nash, drawing a flagrant foul call. During the ensuing commotion, Raja Bell was assessed a technical foul for charging at him. Horry was ejected from the game and suspended for Games 5 and 6. Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire and Boris Diaw, who left the bench, were suspended for Game 5. The Spurs won the two ensuing games and moved on to the 2007 NBA Finals, where they swept the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Horry began wearing the number 25 again after the 2006–07 season. After the 2007–08 season, Horry became a free agent but went unsigned, marking his last professional season.

===Records and honors===
When he retired, Horry held the record for three-pointers all-time in the NBA Finals with 56, having eclipsed Michael Jordan&#x27;s record of 42. Five players passed him before the 2023 NBA finals. He holds the NBA playoffs record for most three-point field goals made in a game without a miss (seven) against the Utah Jazz in Game 2 of the 1997 Western Conference Semifinals. He holds the NBA record for most steals in an NBA finals game.

In 2009, Horry played in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge against the Philippine Basketball Association All-Stars at Araneta Coliseum in Manila.

Horry was the first player to accumulate 100 steals, 100 blocked shots, and 100 threes in one season. In 2010, he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. (Steals &amp; blocks were not recorded until the 1973-74 season and the three-point line was not implemented until the 1979-80 season)

Horry has played in three Game 7s which went to overtime; the 1993 Western Conference Semifinals, as a member of the Houston Rockets, the 2002 Western Conference Finals with the Los Angeles Lakers, and the 2006 Western Conference Semifinals with the San Antonio Spurs.

However, it went right to Horry, who hit the game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Lakers a 100–99 victory and tie the series at 2 going back to Sacramento for Game 5. L.A. eventually beat the Kings in 7 and went on to win their third straight NBA championship.

<doc id="1250523" wikidata="Q1538326" url="?curid=1250523" title="MoSCoW method">
<text>The MoSCoW method is a prioritization technique used in management, business analysis, project management, and software development to reach a common understanding with stakeholders on the importance they place on the delivery of each requirement; it is also known as &quot;MoSCoW prioritization&quot; or &quot;MoSCoW analysis&quot;.

The term &quot;MOSCOW&quot; itself is an acronym derived from the first letter of each of four prioritization categories:
M - &quot;Must have&quot;,
S - &quot;Should have&quot;,
C - &quot;Could have&quot;,
W - &quot;Won’t have&quot;.

The interstitial &quot;O&quot;s are added to make the word pronounceable. While the &quot;O&quot;s are usually in lower-case to indicate that they do not stand for anything, the all-capitals &quot;MOSCOW&quot; is also used.

== Background ==

This prioritization method was developed by Dai Clegg in 1994 for use in rapid application development (RAD). It was first used extensively with the dynamic systems development method (DSDM) from 2002.

MoSCoW is often used with timeboxing, where a deadline is fixed so that the focus must be on the most important requirements, and is commonly used in agile software development approaches such as Scrum, rapid application development (RAD), and DSDM.

== Prioritization of requirements ==

All requirements are important, however to deliver the greatest and most immediate business benefits early the requirements must be prioritized. Developers will initially try to deliver all the &quot;Must have&quot;, &quot;Should have&quot; and &quot;Could have&quot; requirements but the &quot;Should&quot; and &quot;Could&quot; requirements will be the first to be removed if the delivery timescale looks threatened.

The plain English meaning of the prioritization categories has value in getting customers to better understand the impact of setting a priority, compared to alternatives like &quot;High&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot; and &quot;Low&quot;.

The categories are typically understood as:

; Must have
: Requirements labelled as &quot;Must have&quot; are critical to the current delivery timebox in order for it to be a success. If even one &quot;Must have&quot; requirement is not included, the project delivery should be considered a failure (note: requirements can be downgraded from &quot;Must have&quot;, by agreement with all relevant stakeholders; for example, when new requirements are deemed more important). &quot;MUST&quot; can also be considered an acronym for the Minimum Usable Subset.

; Should have
: Requirements labelled as &quot;Should have&quot; are important but not necessary for delivery in the current delivery timebox. While &quot;Should have&quot; requirements can be as important as &quot;Must have&quot;, they are often not as time-critical or there may be another way to satisfy the requirement so that it can be held back until a future delivery timebox.

; Could have
: Requirements labelled as &quot;Could have&quot; are desirable but not necessary and could improve the user experience or customer satisfaction for a little development cost. These will typically be included if time and resources permit.

; Won&#x27;t have (this time)
: Requirements labelled as &quot;Won&#x27;t have&quot;, have been agreed by stakeholders as the least-critical, lowest-payback items, or not appropriate at that time. As a result, &quot;Won&#x27;t have&quot; requirements are not planned into the schedule for the next delivery timebox. &quot;Won&#x27;t have&quot; requirements are either dropped or reconsidered for inclusion in a later timebox. (Note: occasionally the term &quot;Would like to have&quot; is used; however, that usage is incorrect, as this last priority is clearly stating something is outside the scope of delivery). (The BCS in edition 3 &amp; 4 of the Business Analysis Book describe &#x27;W&#x27; as &#x27;Want to have but not this time around&#x27;)

===Variants===
Sometimes W is used to mean &quot;wish&quot; (or &quot;would&quot;), i.e. still possible but unlikely to be included (and less likely than &quot;could&quot;). This is then distinguished from X for &quot;excluded&quot; for items which are explicitly not included. Would is used to indicate features that are not required now, but should be considered in architectural terms during the design as future expansion opportunities - this avoids the risk of dead-end designs that would inhibit a particular feature being offered in the future.

== Use in new product development ==
In new product development, particularly those following agile software development approaches, there is always more to do than there is time or funding to permit (hence the need for prioritization). 

For example, should a team have too many potential epics (i.e., high-level stories) for the next release of their product, they could use the &quot;MoSCoW method&quot; to select which epics are &quot;Must have&quot;, which &quot;Should have&quot;, and so on; the minimum viable product (or MVP) would be all those epics marked as &quot;Must have&quot;. Oftentimes, a team will find that, even after identifying their MVP, they have too much work for their expected capacity. In such cases, the team could then use the &quot;MoSCoW method&quot; to select which features (or stories, if that is the subset of epics in their organisation) are &quot;Must have&quot;, &quot;Should have&quot;, and so on; the minimum marketable features (or MMF) would be all those marked as &quot;Must have&quot;. If there is sufficient capacity after selecting the MVP or MMF, the team could then plan to include &quot;Should have&quot; and even &quot;Could have&quot; items too. 

== Criticism ==
Criticism of the MoSCoW method includes: 
* Does not help decide between multiple requirements within the same priority.
* Lack of rationale around how to rank competing requirements: why something is &quot;must&quot; rather than &quot;should&quot;. 
* Ambiguity over timing, especially on the &quot;Won&#x27;t have&quot; category: whether it is not in this release or not ever. 
* Potential for political focus on building new features over technical improvements (such as refactoring).

== Other methods ==
Other methods used for product prioritization include:

* Kano model prioritization method

<text>The Treaty of Finckenstein (Persian: عهدنامه فین‌کنشتاین), often spelled Finkenstein, was a treaty concluded between France and Iran (Persia) in the Finckenstein Palace (now Kamieniec, Poland) on 4 May 1807 and formalised the Franco-Persian alliance.
Napoleon I guaranteed the integrity of Persia, recognized part of Georgia and the other parts of Transcaucasia and a part of the North Caucasus (Dagestan) as Fath Ali Shah&#x27;s possession, and was to make all possible efforts for restoring those territories to him. Napoleon also promised to furnish the Shah with arms, officers and workmen. France on its side required the Shah to declare war against the United Kingdom, to expel all British people from Persia, and to maintain an open way if France wanted to attack British possessions in the far east. 

Despite the treaty, France failed to achieve diplomatic success in Persia, and none of its provisions were fully implemented. Furthermore, just two months after signing the treaty with Persia, France concluded the Treaties of Tilsit with Russia, effectively abandoning Iran in its struggle against Russian expansion.

On 12 March 1809, the United Kingdom signed a treaty with Persia forcing the French out of that country.

<text>John Mirak (; March 11, 1907 – January 31, 2000) was an Armenian-American businessman who owned several car dealerships and automotive businesses in Massachusetts. He and his family are widely known for their contributions to Armenian society in both the diaspora and the republic.

He was born on March 11, 1907, in the city of Arapgir in the Ottoman Empire. He immigrated to the United States in 1920 after becoming an orphan after the Armenian genocide and married Artemis Mirak, also a genocide survivor from Arapgir.

In 1932 he established The Arlington Center Garage and Service Corporation and with the help of his sons. Then, he started Mirak Chevrolet in Arlington, Massachusetts, in 1936. His dealerships later also included Hyundai. Mirak also had a Lincoln-Mercury-Nissan dealership which closed in the 1990s. The Mirak Chevrolet-Hyundai dealership is located at 1125 Massachusetts Ave. in Arlington, Massachusetts. The Mirak Lincoln-Mercury-Nissan dealership was located at 956 Massachusetts Ave. in Arlington, Massachusetts. In the place where Mirak Lincoln-Mercury-Nissan used to be, a business called RCN is in its place.

He died on January 31, 2000, at Lahey Hitchcock Clinic in Burlington, Massachusetts, at the age of 92 of complications from a stroke.

<text>Titleist (pronounced &quot;title-ist&quot;) is an American brand of golf equipment produced by the Acushnet Company, headquartered in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, United States. Established in 1932 by Philip E. Young, it focuses on golf balls, such as common dominant model, the ProV1. Clubs and golf bags.

The name Titleist is derived from the word &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;title holder&quot;.

== History ==

Philip E. Young, a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, founded Titleist in 1932. When playing a round of golf with his dentist, Young missed a sure putt that seemed to be caused by the weight of the ball. He then asked his dentist friend to X-ray the ball and the film showed that the rubber core was off-center. After this initial discovery, Young took X-rays of more golf balls and found that most were poorly constructed with off-center cores and prone to erratic shots. This inspired Young to produce his own line of golf balls, which would become known as Titleist.

In 1930, Young developed a machine that could uniformly wind rubber string around a rubber core, making a &quot;dead center&quot; golf ball. He named the ball &quot;Titleist,&quot; noting it was the &quot;winner&quot; of the quest to create the best for the game. The golf division of the Acushnet Process Company produced the Titleist golf ball in 1935, which became the company&#x27;s most successful product.

In 1948, Titleist introduced &quot;Dynamite Thread&quot; to increase the yardage of their balls. A year later, Titleist became the most used ball at the U.S. Open Tournament.

Titleist was purchased by American Brands (later renamed to Fortune Brands) in 1976. In 1985, American Brands sold off the Acushnet Company&#x27;s Acushnet Rubber division, which was Acushnet&#x27;s original business (circa early 1900s).

On December 8, 2010, Fortune Brands announced that it would soon sell or spin off Titleist and some other brands. It was then announced on May 20, 2011, that a Korean group associated with Fila Korea, Ltd. and Mirae Asset Private Equity would purchase Acushnet for $1.23 billion in cash.

==Golf balls==
===Pro V1===

The &quot;Pro V1&quot; ball made its debut on the PGA Tour at Las Vegas on October 11, 2000, the first week it was available to the pros. A longtime Titleist user, Billy Andrade, won that first tournament with the new ball. The Pro V1 was available to the public by December. The Pro V1 was a dramatic change in innovation for the golf ball market as a whole and for the brand, which had traditionally used a wound-ball construction (with a liquid-filled core center) for its top-of-the-line golf balls.

Shortly after its introduction the Titleist Pro V1 became the most played ball on the PGA Tour and has been for the past 20 years, picking up the most worldwide wins from both direct brand ambassadors (meaning they play Titleist equipment) and players who are not directly under contract and considered brand ambassadors from Titleist. Three years after Titleist&#x27;s initial breakthrough with the Pro V1 came the Pro V1x, a ball with 60 fewer dimples. The combination of a larger firmer core, a thinner cover, and 60 fewer dimples resulted in a ball that retained the same soft feel of the Pro V1 while reducing spin and increasing distance.

In December 2007, Acushnet lost a patent infringement suit brought by Callaway. The following November, Callaway won an injunction in a Delaware court, ruling that sales of the Pro V1 golf balls must be stopped from January 1, 2009, with professionals being able to continue with their use until the end of the year. Acushnet immediately announced that they would be appealing the decision. Acushnet somewhat redesigned the Pro-V1 during the dispute. On August 14, 2009, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the judgment against Acushnet and ordered a new trial. On March 29, 2010, a federal jury ruled in favor of Acushnet (Titleist), and found that the Callaway patents were invalid.

== Endorsements ==

Titleist has maintained endorsement deals with many leading professional players, including Ludvig Åberg, Cameron Smith, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, and Will Zalatoris.

Players previously contracted with Titleist include Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy, before both moved to Nike and then later TaylorMade, and Phil Mickelson, who switched to Callaway shortly after his 2004 Masters Tournament win.

<text>A teaching assistant (TA) or education assistant (EA) is an individual who assists a professor or teacher with instructional responsibilities. TAs include &quot;graduate teaching assistants&quot; (GTAs), who are graduate students; &quot;undergraduate teaching assistants&quot; (UTAs), who are undergraduate students; &quot;secondary school TAs&quot;, who are either high school students or adults; and &quot;elementary school TAs&quot;, who are adults (also known as &quot;paraprofessional educators&quot; or &quot;teacher&#x27;s aides&quot;).

By definition, TAs assist with classes, but many graduate students serve as the sole instructor for one or more classes each semester as a teaching fellow or graduate student instructor, although in some American states, such as Florida, they are called &quot;teaching assistants&quot;. Graduate and adult TAs generally have a fixed salary determined by each contract period (usually a semester or an academic year); however, undergraduates and high school students are sometimes unpaid and in the US and other countries with the credit system, receive course credits in return for their assistance.

==Graduate==
Graduate teaching assistants (often referred to as GTAs or simply TAs) are graduate students employed on a temporary contract by a department at a college or university in teaching-related responsibilities. In New Zealand, Australian, and some Canadian universities, graduate TAs are known as tutors. North American graduate TA positions provide funding for postgraduate research—although the main purpose is to provide teaching support—and it often serves as a first career step for aspiring academics. TA responsibilities vary greatly and may include: tutoring; holding office hours; invigilating tests or exams; and assisting a professor with a large lecture class by teaching students in recitation, laboratory, or discussion sessions. Professors may also use their teaching assistants to help teach discussions during regular class. This gives the graduate student opportunity to use their teaching skills, as many are in pursuit of teaching careers. Some graduate students assist in distance education courses by meeting with the students as professors are not able to. Graduate TAs should not be confused with teaching fellows (TFs) or graduate student instructors (GSIs), who are graduate students who serve as the primary instructors for courses. However, at some universities, such as those in the Florida State University System, there are neither teaching fellows nor graduate student instructors, and &quot;teaching assistant&quot; is the only title used.

===Tutorials===
In British, Australian, New Zealand, South African, Indian, Italian, Irish and some Canadian universities, a &quot;TA&quot; is often, but not always, a postgraduate student or a lecturer assigned to conduct a seminar for undergraduate students, often known as a tutorial. At the University of Cambridge, tutors are known as &quot;supervisors&quot;, and tutorials are &quot;supervisions&quot;. The equivalent of this kind of tutor in the United States and the rest of Canada is known as a graduate teaching assistant or a graduate student instructor (GSI).

==Undergraduate==
UTAs or JTAs (Junior Teacher Assistants) usually serve as true assistants to a class; they typically have taken the course with which they are assisting, often with the same professor, and have performed well in it. This case is less common for GTAs, since many would have been undergraduates at other institutions. Unlike professors and GTAs, UTAs generally do not have a fixed salary but instead are paid by the hour, earn credit hours, or volunteer their time.

==High school==
The term &quot;teaching assistant&quot; is used in a school setting for students or adults that assist a teacher with one or more classes. The responsibilities, situations, and conditions of these individuals&#x27; involvement differ from those in higher education. A less formal position, a TA job in secondary education is generally determined by the supervising teacher. Common tasks include assisting students with their work, and taking attendance. Most of the responsibilities of Teaching Assistants do not require the academic expertise of the professor in charge. Some teaching assistants at this level may teach portions of the class lessons, or teach lessons to small groups of students who need extra instruction. Many TAs work &quot;one-on-one&quot; with special needs students; these TAs shadow their student and assist with classwork, organization, and behavior management. In some parts of the United States it is customary or even required that each classroom have one certified teacher and one or more co-teachers or teaching assistants.

Students attending high school and middle schools can take a course, usually an elective, and perform tasks such as grade and record scores on homework or tests. The teacher in this setting reviews the grading to assign partial credit on tests and uses discretion.

==Elementary school==
An elementary school teaching assistant is an adult who is hired to help a teacher with class-related duties, which are similar to those encountered in middle and high school settings. They are sometimes referred to as paraprofessionals (&quot;paras&quot; for short) or teacher&#x27;s aides. Elementary school teaching assistants are generally hired on a contract that lasts the entire academic year. Teaching assistants aide with multiple duties within schools and can be hired in special education as well.

<text>USS &quot;LST-558&quot; was a United States Navy tank landing ship in commission from 1944 to 1946.

&quot;LST-558&quot; was laid down on 11 February 1944 at Evansville, Indiana, by the Missouri Valley Bridge and Iron Company. She was launched on 14 April 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Henry Goodman, and commissioned on 8 May 1944.

During World War II, &quot;LST-558&quot; was assigned to the Pacific Theater of Operations and participated in the following operations:

*Capture and occupation of southern Palau Islands — September and October 1944
*Leyte landings — October and November 1944
*Lingayen Gulf landing — January 1945
*Zambales-Subic Bay — January 1945
*Iwo Jima - Assault and occupation, 19 to 25 February 1945

<doc id="1250539" wikidata="Q1198772" url="?curid=1250539" title="Warta Poznań">
<text>Warta Poznań () is a multi-sports club based in Poznań, Poland. The name means &quot;the Guard&quot; in Polish and also the name of the river Warta on which Poznań is located. As of the 2024–25 season, they compete in the second division, after being relegated from the 2023–24 Ekstraklasa.

Founded in 1912, the association football club are two-time winners of the Polish Football Championship, in 1929 and 1947. In 2020, Warta returned to the Polish Ekstraklasa after being absent for 25 years. The club also played in the top level of the Polish football league system from 1927 to 1939, 1946 to 1950, and 1993 to 1995.

In its history, the club celebrated many successes in disciplines such as boxing (the club won the Polish championship 11 times between 1927 and 1939), field hockey (the club won the Polish championship 12 times between 1963 and 1980) and tennis (Wiesław Gąsiorek of Warta was Polish champion 12 times between 1959 and 1970). In total, Warta teams, sportsmen and sportswomen won almost 800 medals in Polish championship competitions in different sports disciplines.

==History==
===Beginnings (1912–1918)===

On 15 June 1912, the Warta Poznań Sports Club (Klub Sportowy Warta Poznań) was established, which later became known as &quot;the first lady of Wielkopolska&quot;. Its founders were young Poles who previously played in the German clubs in Poznań, including Marian Bey, Stefan Malinowski, Stefan Mórkowski, brothers Edmund and Franciszek Szyc and Ludwik Zysnarski. They were included in the first board of the club, whose first president - as the oldest member of the board - became Franciszek Szyc. His brother Edmund was appointed secretary, and Marian Bey was the team captain. At the founding meeting, white and green were chosen as statutory colours. In addition to football, Warta formed an athletics section in 1912 and then a tennis section in 1914.

During German rule, matches involving Polish teams were forbidden, which prompted the decision to organize the first Wielkopolska football championship in 1913, in which three teams participated: Warta Poznań, Posnania and Ostrovia Ostrów Wielkopolski. Warta became the first champion. The results were as follows: Posnania - Warta 1–1, Warta - Ostrovia 3–2, Ostrovia - Warta 3–4, Warta - Posnania 2–2.

The inaugural championship of the region resulted in a surge of football popularity in Poznań. New football teams emerged such as Trytonia founded in Łazarz and a team called Sparta established in Jeżyce. In 1914, despite the start of hostilities related to the outbreak of World War I, efforts were made in Poznań to organize sports events, which was made more difficult by the martial law imposed by the Germans. In general, the regulations did not allow any kind of meeting or assembly to be held without official permits. Despite these difficulties, in 1914 the second Wielkopolska Championships were held, in which only two teams participated: Warta Poznań and KS Posnania. In this two-legged tie, Warta smoothly defeated Posnania 6–3 and 2–1.

There is no reliable information about the 1915 Wielkopolska championship. But Warta also played various friendly matches against Polish and German teams during the war years, including Fever Kościan (1–3 and 5–5) and DSV Posen (2–2) in 1915, and Stella Gniezno (2–2) in 1916. Particularly noteworthy was the 4–0 victory against DSV Posen in 1916 - DSV (Deutscher Sport Verein) was a German football club considered the best football club in Poznań until then. In 1917, Warta celebrated its 5th anniversary year by organising a tournament with the participation of the best football teams from Poznań.

Also in 1917, Franciszek Rotnicki became chairman of the club and, during his chairmanship (1917–1924), he laid the structural foundations for Warta&#x27;s future successes. It was said at the time: &quot;... A man of great authority, energetic and enterprising. It is he, together with a skilfully selected group of associates, who builds solid foundations for the future size of the club in this difficult period.&quot;.

=== Interwar period (1918–1939) ===

World War I hostilities caused enormous losses. Out of 100 Warta club members in 1914, 45 fought in the war, and two founding membersEdmund Szyc and Stefan Malinowskidied in the war. During the successful Greater Poland Uprising against German partitioning authorities, many footballers from Poznań volunteered for military service to fight for their country but the restoration of an independent Polish state after 123 years in 1918 also provided new opportunities, as Polish sports clubs were able to function without interference from foreign powers.

In 1919, pre-war sports structures were re-activated, and the first post-war Wielkopolska championship was held. Five teams entered the competition, including four teams from Poznań - Unia, Warta, Posnania, and Pogoń - as well as Ostrovia from Ostrów Wielkopolski. Warta won the championship, after beating Ostrovia 7–1, Unia 3–2, Posnania 7–0 and Pogoń 7–0. In the following year, the regional championship was abandoned because of the Polish-Soviet War.
In 1921, the first Polish national football championship was successfully held (the championship was previously started and then abandoned in 1920 because of the Polish–Soviet War). It was run similar to a cup competition, according to the &quot;spring-autumn&quot; system, until 1927. In the spring, Warta participated in the Klasa A regional district championship (Warta became champion in 1921, 1922, 1923 and 1926, in 1924-1925 no champion was crowned), with football clubs from Wielkopolska such as Warta, Pogoń and Stella Gniezno. In the autumn, the winners from five regional districts played against each other at national level. Under the club chairmanship of Stanisław Broniarz (chairman 1924 to 1927, deputy chairman 1927 to 1929), Warta was a leading proponent and founding member of the Polish football league, which was launched in 1927.

The interwar period was Warta&#x27;s golden era and Warta was a leading football team in Poland. Between 1922 and 1928, Warta was always in the top three teams in the Polish football championship (there was no championship in 1924). Finally, with the Hungarian coach Béla Fűrst in charge, Warta won its first Polish football championship in 1929. In that season, Warta won 15 out of 24 league matches, it lost fewest goals of all teams (33) and it had - jointly with Cracovia - the best goal difference (+25).

The global economic crisis of 1929 negatively affected Polish sports clubs, including Warta. Despite these difficulties, throughout the 1930s, Warta was again in the top three football clubs in the top division on four occasions. In 1932, Kajetan Kryszkiewicz and Friedrich Scherfke were jointly the top goal scorers in the league, with 15 goals each. Other sports disciplines also fared well. In 1920, the Poznań municipal government handed over large sports grounds to Warta. Warta launched new sports sections, including field hockey (1923), boxing (1924), swimming (1928) and ice hockey (1930). Warta&#x27;s boxing team won the Polish championship 11 times and Warta&#x27;s athletics team won the Polish championship five times.
Warta Poznań encouraged innovations in sports in the inter-war period. In 1929, the victorious Warta match against the Dutch champions Philips Eindhoven (today&#x27;s PSV Eindhoven) was the first football match broadcast on Polish radio (Warta won 5–2). In September 1933, the Warta match against Legia Poznań was the first football match in Poland to be played using artificial lighting.

Polish teams did not yet participate in annual European football club competitions, but the Warta team travelled abroad on many occasions to play friendly games and to take part in football tournaments. Every year, various football teams from Germany, Hungary and elsewhere travelled to Poznań to play Warta. In September 1934, for example, FC Milan (today&#x27;s AC Milan) travelled to Poznań to play against Warta (Warta lost 1–3).

===World War II (1939–1945)===
At the start of World War II in 1939, the football season was interrupted and was never completed. The club was forced to suspend its operations. Poles were not permitted to participate in organised sports events during the German occupation, but some Warta football players clandestinely took part in an unofficial Poznań football championship in 1940 and 1941, with games played on football pitches on the outskirts of town.

During the war, the German occupiers destroyed many documents and club mementos. Some former Warta sportsmen and board members were murdered in German concentration camps. For example, former Warta footballers Marian Einbacher and Adam Knioła were murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp, while former Warta club chairman Stanisław Broniarz was murdered in the Gross-Rosen concentration camp. Three pre-war players, Marian Spoida, Konrad Ofierzyński and Telesfor Banaszkiewicz, were among Poles murdered by the Soviets in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940.

===Postwar period (1945–1990)===

A formal general meeting was held on 18 March 1945 and the club&#x27;s operations were revived. Already in the first post-war season of the Polish football league in 1946, Warta finished the season in second place, losing in the final against Polonia Warsaw (for two years after the war, the Polish championship was contested like a cup competition).

A year later in 1947, Warta played outstanding football under the direction of the Hungarian coach Károly Fogl. In the semi-final of the Polish championship competition, Warta won against AKS Chorzów 4–1 and 2–0. In the final, Warta beat Wisła Kraków 2–0 away in Kraków. Interest in the final match in Poznań was enormous and the stadium attendance was higher than nominal capacity (over 20 000 spectators). The exciting match finished with Warta&#x27;s victory 5–2 and Warta won its second – and so far, last – championship title in its history.

However, the Stalinism era ended the series of Warta&#x27;s successes, as regional Communist leadership favoured the local rival Lech Poznań. In 1949, Warta was de facto forced to change its name to Związkowiec Poznań, which resulted in the disappearance of the historical name Warta. In 1950, Warta was forced to merge with the sports club HCP, which belonged to the Hipolit Cegielski Poznań works – a leading industrial company in Poznań. The HCP team played under the name Stal and the merged club used the name. In the same year, Warta&#x27;s football team was relegated from the top division. From 1951 to 1956, the club played under the name Stal Poznań.
On 29 December 1956, a general meeting of the club decided to return to the old name Warta. The Hipolit Cegielski Poznań works continued to sponsor the club. Their involvement did not return Warta to its former glory, but it significantly helped to develop the club&#x27;s logistical base. Warta received funds to re-develop its sports facilities and was able to use the Edmund Szyc Stadium (then called &quot;22 July Stadium&quot;) with a capacity of 60,000.

During the post-war period, the Warta football team never returned to the top flight. However, Warta celebrated successes in other sports – most notably, in field hockey and tennis. In field hockey, Warta won the Polish championship 12 times between 1963 and 1980 and they were runners-up nine times between 1957 and 1981. Warta participated in the EuroHockey Club Champions Cup (Europe&#x27;s premier field hockey club competition) six times between 1969 and 1977, coming fifth in Europe in the 1969 EuroHockey Club Champions Cup.

In the Polish tennis league, Warta&#x27;s tennis team became Polish champions in 1965 and 1970 and were runners-up in 1961, 1964, 1966, and 1969. Warta&#x27;s tennis section was particularly known for the individual achievements of Wiesław Gąsiorek, who was Polish men&#x27;s singles champion 12 times between 1959 and 1970.

In 1989, at the end of the Communist period, Warta and Hipolit Cegielski Poznań works parted ways. After some negotiations, the Edmund Szyc Stadium and the sports grounds were transferred to the club.

===Post-Communist period (1990–2018)===

At the beginning of the 1990s, Warta returned to the top tier of the Polish football league system after 43 years for two seasons 1993/94 and 1994/95.

After relegation in 1995, Warta mostly played in the third tier of the league system over the next decade. The Edmund Szyc Stadium fell into disrepair by 1998. Warta subsequently played its football matches in the Warta Poznań Stadium &quot;-&quot; former training ground of the Edmund Szyc stadium, nicknamed Ogródek (Little Garden).

In the 2007–08 season, Warta returned to the second tier of the Polish football league system.
In January 2011, former model and new owner Izabella Łukomska-Pyżalska became chairwoman. Debts of the ailing club were repaid and the budget was increased. Warta started to play its games in the Municipal Stadium in Poznań. However, Warta remained in the second tier. After relegation in 2013 and because of club debts, Warta landed in the fourth tier of the league system where it spent two seasons 2014/2015 and 2015/16.

In 2016, Warta was promoted to II liga (the third tier of the league system).

In 2018, Warta was able to advance to I liga (the second tier) again. 

However, by the autumn of 2018, the club&#x27;s finances were in serious trouble. The situation was so desperate that the football team captain Bartosz Kieliba said: &quot;Several months of player wages are in arrears, there is no certainty whether we will ever play another game, which does not help our work in training or our stance in matches&quot;.

=== Period of renewal (2018–present) ===
In August 2018, businessman Bartłomiej Farjaszewski bought the football section of Warta (under the name: Warta Poznań SA) and repaid the club&#x27;s debts. Following the legal separation in 2018, there are now two organisations: Warta Poznań SA focuses on all football teams, whereas KS Warta Poznań continues as a multi-sports club (which includes fencing, field hockey and swimming sections, among others).

In June 2019, Piotr Tworek replaced Petr Němec as football coach. In 2020, with experienced players such as Bartosz Kieliba and Łukasz Trałka, Warta surprisingly finished the 2019–20 I liga season in third place. After winning the promotion playoffs, Warta returned to the Polish Ekstraklasa after being absent for 25 years.
At the start of the 2020–21 season, many football pundits predicted Warta&#x27;s relegation. Defying all expectations, with new players such as striker Mateusz Kuzimski (summer 2020 signing) and winger Makana Baku (on loan from January 2021), Warta finished fifth in the league, missing out on qualification to the Europa Conference League by just one point. This represented Warta football team&#x27;s best result since winning the football championship in 1947.

Following Warta&#x27;s poor start to the 2021-22 season (17th place in the league with only eight points in thirteen league games), Dawid Szulczek replaced Piotr Tworek as football coach in November 2021. Under Szulczek, Warta finished 11th in the league in the 2021–22 season and 8th in the 2022–23 season.

They contested the 2023–24 season much in the same way as their recent top-flight campaigns, with a below-average budget and limited transfer activity. On 18 April 2024, Szulczek announced he would not extend his contract and would depart Warta at the end of the season. On 25 May that year, the last matchday, Warta suffered a 0–3 loss to Jagiellonia Białystok and were jumped in the standings by Korona Kielce following their away win over Lech Poznań. As a result, Warta finished 16th and were relegated, ending their four-year stay in the top division.

As the Warta Poznań Municipal Stadium (Ogródek) does not conform to Ekstraklasa licensing requirements, the senior Warta football team plays its home games in the Stadion Dyskobolii Grodzisk Wielkopolski. Warta Poznań also has youth teams (both boys and girls) in different age groups in the Central Junior League, a women&#x27;s football team and an amputee football team. The club is well known for initiatives to protect the natural environment and its support for social inclusion, and has plans for an eco-friendly new stadium in future. In May and June 2024, they were in talks to host their home games at the Enea Stadion from the start of the 2024–25 season, before Warta&#x27;s negotiations with the venue&#x27;s operator ultimately fell through.

<text>Jacob Edward Peavy (born May 31, 1981) is an American former professional baseball pitcher, who is currently an on-air analyst for MLB Network. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, and San Francisco Giants. He batted and threw right-handed.

While with the Padres, he won the 2007 NL Cy Young Award after recording the Pitching Triple Crown that year. He was traded from the White Sox to the Red Sox in 2013, and helped them to a World Series title later that season. A year later he was traded to the San Francisco Giants, with whom he won another title that season. He is the second starting pitcher after Don Gullett to win two consecutive World Series championship titles with different teams, one in each league. He is one of ten players in Major League history to have won back-to-back World Series championships titles on different teams (Joc Pederson, Ben Zobrist, Jack Morris, Bill Skowron, Clem Labine, Don Gullett, Allie Clark, Ryan Theriot, Will Smith).

==Early life==
Jacob Edward Peavy was born on May 31, 1981, in Mobile, Alabama.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Peavy was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 15th round (472nd overall) of the 1999 MLB draft out of high school (St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal School). He was named the high school player of the year in the state of Alabama. Peavy declined an offer to pitch for Auburn University in order to accept the Padres&#x27; contract offer.

Peavy pitched for the Arizona League Padres and the Idaho Falls Braves in 1999 and the Fort Wayne Wizards in 2000. In 2001, Peavy played with the Lake Elsinore Storm and the Mobile BayBears. He split the 2002 season between the BayBears and the San Diego Padres.

===San Diego Padres (2002–2009)===
====2002–2006====
Peavy was called up from Double-A to make his major league debut on June 22, 2002, against the New York Yankees at Qualcomm Stadium. He lost the game, allowing one run on three hits in six innings while striking out four. In total, Peavy had six wins and seven losses with a 4.52 earned run average (ERA) and 90 strikeouts. The Padres won just 66 games and were in the cellar of the NL West. In his sophomore season, Peavy started 32 games (194.2 IP), with a 4.11 earned run average, a 12–11 record, and 156 strikeouts. The Padres finished last in their division again at a 64–98 record.

During his third year of major league experience in 2004, Peavy emerged as the Padres&#x27; ace starting pitcher and one of the best pitchers in baseball. He compiled a 15–6 record, struck out 173 in 166 innings, and led Major League Baseball with a 2.27 ERA. He became the youngest pitcher to win an ERA title since Dwight Gooden in 1985. On September 17, 2004, Peavy allowed Barry Bonds&#x27; 700th career home run. Additionally Peavy would later end up being the final pitcher Bonds ever faced in his career, on September 26th, 2007.

On March 5, 2005, he signed a four-year, $14.5 million contract and held a club option for 2009 extension with the Padres.

During the 2005 season, Peavy was selected for the National League All-Star team and ended the regular season leading the National League in strikeouts with 216 (in 203 innings). He was second in the majors to Minnesota&#x27;s Johan Santana who had 238 strikeouts. In addition, he finished the season with a 13–7 record, 2.88 ERA, a strikeout-to-walk ratio of over 4:1 and WHIP of 1.044.

After the Padres won the National League West in 2005, Peavy missed the rest of the season with a broken rib, which he apparently suffered while celebrating.
Peavy was the captain of Team USA in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, held in San Diego. He started the opening game for the U.S., a 2–0 win over Mexico, giving up just one hit and no runs over three innings. He did not factor in the decision in the second-round game against Japan, as he gave up three runs in five innings in a game that the U.S. won, 4–3.

In 2006, Peavy got off to a rocky start, in part due to mechanical adjustments brought on by various off-season injuries. Although Peavy would go only 11–14 with a 4.09 ERA, he still managed to finish second in the National League in strikeouts with 215, one shy of both his 2005 league-leading total and of the 2006 NL strikeout leader, Aaron Harang, who logged 32 more innings than Peavy. In the playoffs, the Padres again faced the St. Louis Cardinals in the first round. As the game one starter, Peavy had a much stronger outing than his 2005 playoff game, but the Padres again lost to the Cardinals.

====2007–2009====
On July 1, 2007, for the second time in his career, Peavy was named to the 2007 NL All-Star Team. On July 9, he was named as the starting pitcher for the NL. On August 2, Peavy struck out Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder Jeff DaVanon, for his 1000th career strikeout.

Peavy won the pitching Triple Crown in 2007, leading the National League with 19 wins, 240 strikeouts, and a 2.54 ERA. Since the divisional play era started in 1969, Peavy is only the eighth player to accomplish this feat. On October 23, Peavy won the Players Choice Award for Outstanding NL Pitcher. He added the NL Cy Young award—as a unanimous choice—on November 15, becoming just the 10th National League player in history to win the Cy Young Award in a unanimous vote (Sandy Koufax was unanimously selected three times).

The completion of the 2007 campaign represented Peavy&#x27;s sixth year in the league. Over that six-year period Peavy collected two strikeout champion awards, two major league ERA titles, and a unanimous, triple-crown Cy Young Award.

On December 12, 2007, he signed a 4-year extension, worth $52 million with the Padres. At the time the contract was the largest in Padres history. The contract included a $22 million option for 2013.

On April 5, 2008, Peavy pitched a two-hit complete game over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The following day, still-images from FOX sports video feed from the game showed a dirty, brown substance on the index and middle fingers, along with his thumb. Manager Bud Black defended Peavy saying that &quot;it was a mixture of dirt and rosin&quot;. In the two games immediately following the report, Peavy posted a 1–0 record with a 1.92 ERA. In May, he went on the DL with a sore throwing elbow. He returned on June 12 and pitched six shutout innings with four strikeouts. He ended 2008 with only a 10–11 record, but had one of the lowest run support per start of any pitcher in the league, and finished the season with a 2.85 ERA.

Peavy had been the subject of numerous trade rumors during the 2008 offseason, amidst reports that the Padres were looking to reduce salaries and build on young players for the future. In November 2008, Peavy added the New York Yankees to the list of teams he would accept a trade to. The list included several teams from the NL including the Atlanta Braves, St. Louis Cardinals, the Chicago Cubs, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Houston Astros. Peavy preferred to be in the NL, so the Yankees would not be involved. The Astros and Cardinals decided they would not pursue Peavy after talking with GM Kevin Towers on what they would have to give up.

In November 2008, the Padres were working with the Braves on a Peavy trade, in which Peavy would be traded to Atlanta for SS Yunel Escobar, OF Gorkys Hernández, P Blaine Boyer and one of P Charlie Morton or P Jo-Jo Reyes. The Padres wanted the two top prospects in the organization as well, pitcher Tommy Hanson and outfielder Jordan Schafer, but after a few weeks, the Braves decided to move on to bring in a few free agents.

In spring training, Peavy pitched 14 total innings with no runs allowed, 10 strikeouts and no walks. He rejected a trade to the Chicago White Sox, which included Aaron Poreda and Clayton Richard, saying that remaining in San Diego was best for him and his family. On May 22, Peavy hurt his ankle rounding third base against the Chicago Cubs in a start where he earned the win with 6 scoreless innings and 10 strikeouts a day after rejecting a trade to the White Sox. On June 12, Peavy learned he had a strained tendon in the back of his ankle, suffered in the May 22 start. He was placed on the DL the same day. At the time of his injury, Peavy was 6–6 with 3.96 ERA and 92 strikeouts.

===Chicago White Sox (2009–2013)===
On July 31, Peavy agreed to a trade to the Chicago White Sox in a last-minute trade deadline day deal for Clayton Richard, Aaron Poreda, Adam Russell and Dexter Carter.

In his first start for the White Sox, Peavy pitched 5 innings, giving up 3 runs (all earned), and striking out 5, getting the win against the Kansas City Royals. Peavy went 3–0 in his time with the White Sox compiling his year&#x27;s record to 9–6. In his 2009 stint with the White Sox he shut out the Detroit Tigers on two occasions.
In 2010, Peavy started 2–5 with a 6.05 ERA. Peavy then won five consecutive starts with a 1.99 ERA. On July 6, while pitching in the second inning against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Peavy injured his right arm and immediately walked off the field. He was diagnosed with a detached latissimus dorsi muscle in his back. He underwent surgery on July 14, 2010, at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and was knocked out for the remainder of the season.

Due to various injuries and fatigue, Peavy was limited to only pitching in 19 games in 2011. Peavy started 18 games and came out of the bullpen once for the first time ever in his MLB career. Peavy finished the season posting a win–loss record of 7–7 with an ERA of 4.92 and 95 strikeouts.

Peavy was named the AL Pitcher of the Month for April 2012, pitching 3–1 with a 1.67 ERA and 33 strikeouts in 5 starts, all quality starts. Peavy threw 2 consecutive complete games and one shutout. On July 8, 2012, Peavy was selected to the All-Star Game as a replacement for C. J. Wilson. Peavy was awarded the 2012 American League Gold Glove Award, sharing the award with Tampa Bay&#x27;s Jeremy Hellickson. It was the first Gold Glove award of his career. On October 30, 2012, Peavy signed a two-year, $29 million extension with a vesting option for 2015, keeping him with the White Sox at least through the 2014 season.

On June 4, 2013, Peavy came out of a game against the Seattle Mariners in the fourth inning with a left rib fracture and was placed on the disabled list. Prior to that, he had registered a 4.30 ERA, 1.16 WHIP and 66/15 K/BB ratio in 67 innings. He was activated from the DL and made his first start against the Atlanta Braves on July 20.

===Boston Red Sox (2013–2014)===
On July 30, 2013, Peavy was traded to the Boston Red Sox along with Brayan Villarreal in a three-team trade, in which José Iglesias went to the Detroit Tigers and Avisail García, J. B. Wendelken, Frankie Montas and Cleuluis Rondon went to the White Sox. On August 3, Peavy had a winning debut as the Red Sox defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 5–2.

On October 30, 2013, Peavy and his fellow Boston Red Sox teammates won the World Series, the first of Peavy&#x27;s career. After the victory parade, in which Red Sox players and coaches rode through the streets of Boston on duck boats, Peavy purchased the duck boat that carried him and teammate Jon Lester, to commemorate the season.

===San Francisco Giants (2014–2016)===
On July 26, 2014, the Boston Red Sox traded Peavy to the San Francisco Giants along with cash considerations for pitching prospects Edwin Escobar and Heath Hembree. This trade reunited Peavy with manager Bruce Bochy. Having worn number 44 throughout his career, Peavy wore jersey number 43, since number 44 is retired in honor of Giants&#x27; Hall of Famer Willie McCovey.

After losing his first three quality starts as a Giant, including a perfect game through innings, Peavy switched his jersey number from 43 to 22 for good luck; number 22 was his jersey number from Mobile, Alabama. On August 13, 2014, in a 7–1 home win over his former team the Chicago White Sox, Peavy recorded his first career win as a Giant after switching numbers. On August 30, 2014, in a 3–1 home win against the Milwaukee Brewers, Peavy struck out Aramis Ramírez for his 2,000th career strikeout, three days after teammate Tim Hudson got his. He did not allow a hit until the eighth inning to Mark Reynolds.

He won the first game of the 2014 NLDS against the Washington Nationals on October 3, 2014. On October 29, 2014, Peavy won his second consecutive World Series ring, despite losing both his starts, after the Giants defeated the Royals, 3–2, in Game 7. Peavy became the second starting pitcher after Don Gullett to win two consecutive World Series championship titles with two teams, one in each league. He is one of ten players in Major League history to win back-to-back World Series championship titles on different teams. (Will Smith, Joc Pederson, Ben Zobrist, Ryan Theriot, Jack Morris, Bill Skowron, Don Gullett, Clem Labine, and Allie Clark)

On December 19, 2014, Peavy agreed to a two-year deal worth $24 million to stay with the Giants. He went on to play with San Francisco through the 2016 season; in his three years with the Giants he had a 19–19 record and 3.97 ERA, with 238 strikeouts and 78 walks in 308 innings pitched. He became a free agent on November 3, 2016.

==Post-playing career==
Peavy did not pitch in MLB or the minor leagues during the 2017 season. In May 2018, he stated his interest in a comeback. He officially announced his retirement on May 5, 2019. In 2023, he was announced as a new inductee of the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame.

== Broadcasting career ==
In March 2022, Peavy joined MLB Network as an on-air analyst and has since appeared on multiple MLB Network shows including MLB Tonight.

==Scouting report==
Peavy&#x27;s repertoire included six pitches, although he mostly used a four-seam fastball at 88–92 mph and a slider in the low 80s. He also had a two-seam fastball, a curveball, a changeup, and a cutter. Peavy tended to throw the curve and change more against lefties, and he did not use his two-seamer or cutter often. Peavy&#x27;s two-seam fastball acted primarily as a sinker and induced many ground balls. This allowed Peavy to induce many double plays when runners were on base. Peavy liked to run his fastballs in on lefties and make the pitch break back into the zone, similar to a power version of Greg Maddux&#x27;s technique.

==Personal life==
Peavy married his high school sweetheart, Katie Alford, in 2000, when he was 19 years old. They have four sons: Jacob, Wyatt, Judson, and Waylon. Peavy&#x27;s divorce was finalized on November 28, 2017, and he and his ex maintain joint custody of their children.

Peavy is legally blind without corrective lenses. He is an outspoken Christian and has been interviewed about his religion. Peavy has a tattoo on his forearm with the word &quot;Outsider&quot;.

In 2008, Peavy bought a ranch in Wilcox County, Alabama called Southern Falls Plantation. The property includes a bowling alley, saloon, hunting lodge, and replica of Fenway Park. In 2013, Peavy bought for the plantation a World War II duck boat formerly used by Boston Duck Tours for tourist purposes and special events like the 2013 World Series Parade. He hopes it will become a family heirloom. During a World Series Game 6 pre-game press conference, Peavy&#x27;s son let the media know that his dad would purchase the family a cable car for the ranch if the Giants won the 2014 World Series, which they did. Once shipped to Alabama, it was planned to be converted into a bar.

Peavy is a fan of Alabama Crimson Tide football and was invited to be a guest for ESPN&#x27;s College Gameday on the campus of Alabama in 2013.

In 2015, Peavy stated he had been a smokeless tobacco user since he was in fifth grade.

Peavy started playing guitar in 2002 when he and Tim Flannery were with the San Diego Padres. He has since performed at several benefit concerts.

During the San Francisco Giants&#x27; 2016 spring training camp, Peavy learned that he had been the victim of a Ponzi-like scheme at the hands of his financial advisor who had siphoned away some $15 million to $20 million of his retirement savings.

<doc id="1250549" wikidata="Q3320796" url="?curid=1250549" title="Euskobarómetro">
<text>The Euskobarómetro (&quot;Basque-barometer&quot;) is a sociological statistical survey in the Basque Country (&quot;País Vasco&quot;), an autonomous community of Spain. It is conducted by the Department of Political Science of the University of the Basque Country.

==Technique==
The poll does not cover Navarre or the Basque areas of France; where Basque nationalism is generally believed to be weaker than in the three provinces of the Basque Country autonomous community.
It is based on personal interviews at home.

== On Basque separatism ==
Because the Spanish government has passed laws outlawing formal referendums about the possibility of Basque independence, the Euskobarómetro is one of the better gauges available of the extent of Basque political sentiment. According to the survey, a significant number of Basques support independence of their region from Spain, but rather few support the violence of groups such as ETA:

* 33% favor Basque independence, 31% federalism, 32% autonomy, 2% centralism. (2% undecided or not answering)
*Asked whether they agree or disagree with the statement, &quot;Today in Euskadi it is possible to defend all political aspirations and objectives without the necessity of resorting to violence&quot;, 87% agree and only 4% disagree (9% undecided or not answering). In fact, 33% of those who identify politically with ETA-affiliated Batasuna agreed with the statement.
*Asked directly about their views of ETA, 60% rejected ETA totally and another 18% identified themselves as former ETA sympathizers who no longer support the group. Another 13% agreed with ETA&#x27;s ends, but not their means. 3% said that their attitude towards ETA was mainly one of fear, 2% indifference. Only 2%, all identified with Batasuna, gave ETA support even as mild as &quot;justified, with criticism&quot;. 2% were undecided or did not answer. Even within Batasuna, 63% rejected ETA&#x27;s violence.

<doc id="1250550" wikidata="Q7194203" url="?curid=1250550" title="Pillow block bearing">
<text>A pillow block bearing (or plummer block) is a mounting used to support a rotating shaft with the use of bearings and various accessories. The assembly consists of a mounting block which houses a bearing. The block is mounted to a foundation, and a shaft is inserted, allowing the inner part of the bearing/shaft to rotate. The inside of the bearing is typically larger diameter than the shaft to ensure a tight fit. Set screws, locking collars, or set collars are commonly used to secure the shaft. Housing material for a pillow block is typically made of cast iron or cast steel.

==Types==
A pillow block usually refers to a housing with an included anti-friction bearing, wherein the mounted shaft is in a parallel plane to the mounting surface and perpendicular to the center line of the mounting holes, as contrasted with various types of flange blocks or flange units.

=== Bearing types ===
A pillow block may contain a bearing with one of several types of rolling elements, including ball, cylindrical roller, spherical roller, tapered roller, or metallic or synthetic bushing. The type of rolling element defines the type of pillow block.

=== Plummer blocks ===
Pillow blocks differ from &quot;plummer blocks&quot; which are bearing housings supplied without any bearings and are usually meant for higher load ratings and a separately installed bearing. Plummer block bearings are designed for more corrosive environments. The fundamental application of both types is the same, which is to mount a bearing safely enabling its outer ring to be stationary while allowing rotation of the inner ring. The housing is bolted to a foundation through the holes in the base.

== Construction ==
Bearing housings may be either split type or solid type. Split type housings are usually two-piece housings where the cap and base may be detached, while solid are single-piece housings.

=== Dust and water protection ===
Various sealing arrangements may be provided to prevent dust and other contaminants from entering the housing. Thus, the housing provides a clean environment for the environmentally sensitive bearing to rotate free from contaminants while retaining lubrication, either oil or grease, increasing its performance and duty cycle. 

=== Materials ===
Bearing housings are usually made of grey cast iron. However, various grades of metals can be used to manufacture the same, including ductile iron, steel, stainless steel, and various types of thermoplastics and polyethylene-based plastics.

The bearing element may be manufactured from 52100 chromium steel alloy (the most common), stainless steel, plastic, or bushing materials such as SAE660 cast bronze, SAE841 oil impregnated sintered bronze, or synthetic materials.

== Standards ==
ISO 113 specifies internationally accepted dimensions for plummer blocks.

<doc id="1250552" wikidata="Q898473" url="?curid=1250552" title="Paper chromatography">
<text>Paper chromatography is an analytical method used to separate colored chemicals or substances. It can also be used for colorless chemicals that can be located by a stain or other visualisation method after separation. It is now primarily used as a teaching tool, having been replaced in the laboratory by other chromatography methods such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC).

This analytic method has three components, a mobile phase, stationary phase and a support medium. The mobile phase is a solution that travels up the stationary phase by capillary action. The mobile phase is generally a mixture of non-polar organic solvent, while the stationary phase is polar inorganic solvent water. Here, paper is used to support the stationary phase, water. Polar water molecules are held inside the void space of the cellulose network of the paper. The difference between TLC and paper chromatography is that the stationary phase in TLC is a layer of adsorbent (usually silica gel, or aluminium oxide), and the stationary phase in paper chromatography is less absorbent paper.

A paper chromatography variant, two-dimensional chromatography, involves using two solvents and rotating the paper 90° in between. This is useful for separating complex mixtures of compounds having similar polarity, for example, amino acids.

== R&quot;ƒ&quot; value, solutes, and solvents ==
The retention factor (R&quot;ƒ&quot;) may be defined as the ratio of the distance travelled by the solute to the distance travelled by the solvent. It is used in chromatography to quantify the amount of retardation of a sample in a stationary phase relative to a mobile phase. R&quot;ƒ&quot; values are usually expressed as a fraction of two decimal places. 
* If R&quot;ƒ&quot; value of a solution is zero, the solute remains in the stationary phase and thus it is immobile. 
* If R&quot;ƒ&quot; value = 1 then the solute has no affinity for the stationary phase and travels with the solvent front. 
For example, if a compound travels 9.9 cm and the solvent front travels 12.7 cm, the R&quot;ƒ&quot; value = (9.9/12.7) = 0.779 or 0.78. R&quot;ƒ&quot; value depends on temperature and the solvent used in experiment, so several solvents offer several R&quot;ƒ&quot; values for the same mixture of compound. A solvent in chromatography is the liquid the paper is placed in, and the solute is the ink which is being separated.

==Pigments and polarity==
Paper chromatography is one method for testing the purity of compounds and identifying substances. Paper chromatography is a useful technique because it is relatively quick and requires only small quantities of material. Separations in paper chromatography involve the principle of partition. In paper chromatography, substances are distributed between a stationary phase and a mobile phase. The stationary phase is the water trapped between the cellulose fibers of the paper. The mobile phase is a developing solution that travels up the stationary phase, carrying the samples with it. Components of the sample will separate readily according to how strongly they adsorb onto the stationary phase versus how readily they dissolve in the mobile phase.

When a colored chemical sample is placed on a filter paper, the colors separate from the sample by placing one end of the paper in a solvent. The solvent diffuses up the paper, dissolving the various molecules in the sample according to the polarities of the molecules and the solvent. If the sample contains more than one color, that means it must have more than one kind of molecule. Because of the different chemical structures of each kind of molecule, the chances are very high that each molecule will have at least a slightly different polarity, giving each molecule a different solubility in the solvent. The unequal solubility causes the various color molecules to leave solution at different places as the solvent continues to move up the paper. The more soluble a molecule is, the higher it will migrate up the paper. If a chemical is very non-polar it will not dissolve at all in a very polar solvent. This is the same for a very polar chemical and a very non-polar solvent.

When using water (a very polar substance) as a solvent, the more polar the color, the higher it will rise on the papers.

==Types==

===Descending===
Development of the chromatogram is done by allowing the solvent to travel down the paper. Here, the mobile phase is placed in a solvent holder at the top. The spot is kept at the top and solvent flows down the paper from above.

===Ascending===
Here the solvent travels up the chromatographic paper. Both descending and ascending paper chromatography are used for the separation of organic and inorganic substances.
The sample and solvent move upward.

===The ascending and descending method===
This is the hybrid of both of the above techniques. The upper part of ascending chromatography can be folded over a rod in order to allow the paper to become descending after crossing the rod.

===Circular chromatography===
A circular filter paper is taken and the sample is deposited at the center of the paper. After drying the spot, the filter paper is tied horizontally on a Petri dish containing solvent, so that the wick of the paper is dipped in the solvent. The solvent rises through the wick and the components are separated into concentric rings.

===Two-dimensional===
In this technique a square or rectangular paper is used. Here the sample is applied to one of the corners and development is performed at a right angle to the direction of the first run.

== History of paper chromatography ==
The discovery of paper chromatography in 1943 by Martin and Synge provided, for the first time, the means of surveying constituents of plants and for their separation and identification. Erwin Chargaff credits in Weintraub&#x27;s history of the man the 1944 article by Consden, Gordon and Martin. There was an explosion of activity in this field after 1945.

<doc id="1250565" wikidata="Q723488" url="?curid=1250565" title="Howard Buffett">
<text>Howard Homan Buffett (August 13, 1903 – April 30, 1964) was an American businessman, investor, and politician. He was a four-term Republican United States Representative for the state of Nebraska. He was the father of Warren Buffett, the billionaire businessman and investor.

==Early life==
Howard Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska, to Henrietta Duvall Buffett and Ernest P. Buffett, owners of a grocery business. Ernest P. Buffett&#x27;s parents were second cousins, both having mainly English descent. The Buffet surname (renamed to Buffett) originates in France with a Huguenot weaver, named John Buffett, who became Buffett&#x27;s first American Buffett ancestor when he immigrated to New York in the late-1600s. Howard Buffett attended public schools and graduated from the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1925. While a student, Buffett was a brother of the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. He married Leila Stahl on December 27, 1925. The Buffetts were active members of the Dundee Presbyterian Church. After failing to secure a job in the family grocery business, he started a small stock brokerage firm.

==Career==
Entering the investment business, Buffett also served on the Omaha board of education from 1939 to 1942. In 1942 he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nebraska district in which Omaha was located. In that election, Buffett was seen as &quot;a Republican sacrificial lamb in Nebraska&#x27;s second district when FDR was a popular wartime leader.&quot; Nevertheless, he went on to win the Republican nomination in the primary and then the subsequent general election.

He was reelected twice. In 1948 he again was the Republican nominee for another term, but was defeated for reelection; however, he was the Republican nominee for the office again in 1950 and won the office back. In 1952 Buffett decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha, Buffett-Falk &amp; Co., in which he worked until shortly before his death. He also served as the campaign manager for conservative Senator Robert A. Taft in Taft&#x27;s 1952 presidential campaign.

According to Warren Buffett biographer Roger Lowenstein:

==Political philosophy==
Howard Buffett is remembered for his highly libertarian Old Right stance, having maintained a friendship with Murray Rothbard for a number of years. He &quot;would invariably draw &#x27;zero&#x27; ratings from the Americans for Democratic Action and other leftist groups.&quot;

Buffett was a vocal critic of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. Of the Truman Doctrine, he said: &quot;Our Christian ideals cannot be exported to other lands by dollars and guns.&quot; Buffett was also &quot;one of the major voices in Congress opposed to the Korean adventure,&quot; and &quot;was convinced that the United States was largely responsible for the eruption of conflict in Korea; for the rest of his life he tried unsuccessfully to get the Senate Armed Services Committee to declassify the testimony of CIA head Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, which Buffett told [Rothbard] established American responsibility for the Korean outbreak.&quot; The CIA failed to predict the Marxist invasion of the Republic of Korea in 1950, just as it had failed to predict the Soviet Atomic Bomb the previous year, it was these intelligence failures that Rear Admiral Hillenkoetter testified about.

Speaking on the floor of Congress, he opposed military interventionism:
In the summer of 1962, he wrote &quot;an impassioned plea... for the abolition of the draft&quot; in the &quot;New Individualist Review&quot;. Buffett wrote:

In addition to non-interventionism overseas, Howard Buffett strongly supported the gold standard because he believed it would limit the ability of government to inflate the money supply and spend beyond its means. His son Warren Buffett is not an advocate of the gold standard.

== Personal life ==
Buffett married Leila Stahl Buffett (March 18, 1904 – August 30, 1996). They had three children:
* Warren Buffett (son): businessman, investor, and philanthropist, Chairman &amp; CEO of Berkshire Hathaway
** Peter Buffett (grandson): musician, composer, and producer
** Howard Graham Buffett (grandson): Corporate board member of Berkshire Hathaway
*** Howard Warren Buffett (great-grandson): Public relations professor at Columbia University
**Susan Alice Buffett (granddaughter)

<doc id="1250582" wikidata="Q3986091" url="?curid=1250582" title="The Brand New Monty Python Bok">
<text>The Brand New Monty Python Bok was the second book to be published by the British comedy troupe Monty Python. Edited by Eric Idle, it was published by Methuen Books in 1973 and contained more print-style comic pieces than their first effort, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Big Red Book&quot;.

The white dust jacket was printed with some realistic looking smudged fingerprints on the front, leading to several complaints and returned copies from booksellers. These complaints paled in comparison to the fuss created about the cover printed on the actual book. The title of the fake cover was &quot;Tits &#x27;n Bums&quot;, appearing as a pornographic magazine with a background photo of several intertwined naked women, but purporting to be a church magazine with articles such as &quot;Are you still a verger?&quot;, and a &#x27;weekly look at church architecture&#x27;. As Michael Palin remembered: &quot;Our publisher Geoffrey Strachan told the story of an elderly lady bookseller from Newbury who refused to believe the fingerprints were put there deliberately. &#x27;In that case I shall sell the books without their jackets&#x27;, she said and slammed the phone down so quickly that Geoffrey was unable to warn her that beneath each dust-cover was a mock soft-core magazine&quot;.

The book contained an amalgamation of print-style pieces and material derived from Flying Circus sketches. Examples of the former include an interconnected series of jokes based on figures of speech and an advertisement for the fictional Welsh martial art of Llap Goch, which claims to be able to teach students how to grow taller, stronger, faster, and more deadly in a matter of days. Examples of the latter include Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Salad Days&quot; and the Travel Agent sketch, a collection of stereotypes about annoying tourists and the perils of inter-country air travel.

In 1974 a paperback edition was issued as The Brand New Monty Python Papperbok, containing the same contents minus the &quot;Tits &#x27;n Bums&quot; book cover. In 1981 both this book and &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Big Red Book&quot; were reissued as a hardback book entitled The Complete Works Of Shakespeare And Monty Python: Volume One - Monty Python. Paperback editions of both these books were reissued again in 1986 as The Monty Python Gift Boks, sold together inside an outer cover which folded out into a mini poster.

<doc id="1250592" wikidata="Q6722293" url="?curid=1250592" title="Mac Harb">
<text>Mac Harb (born November 10, 1953) is a former Canadian politician, who served successively in local Ottawa positions, as a Member of the House of Commons, and as a Senator for Ontario. He resigned his seat as Senator in 2013 amidst the Canadian Senate expenses scandal.

== Life and career ==
Harb, was born in Chaat, Lebanon, and emigrated to Canada to study at the University of Ottawa in 1973. He subsequently worked as an engineer at Northern Telecom and a professor at Algonquin College in Ottawa. Harb was elected to Ottawa City Council in 1985 and served as deputy mayor in 1987 and 1988.

He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1988 federal election as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Ottawa Centre. He supported Jean Chrétien&#x27;s bid to succeed John Turner as leader of the Liberal Party in 1990 and remained a Chrétien loyalist throughout his career as an MP.

In September 2003, Harb was appointed to the Senate of Canada on Chrétien&#x27;s recommendation.

In March 2009, Harb attempted to introduce a bill that would have limited the East Coast seal hunt to only those with aboriginal treaty rights. No senator seconded his motion to introduce the bill, something that other senators could not recall happening in over two decades. He also attempted to introduce a bill in June 2011 that would outlaw commercial seal hunting, and had introduced a third bill against the seal hunt in May 2012. PETA subsequently honoured him as their &quot;Canadian Person of the Year&quot;.

== Local Ottawa politics ==

After the 1991 Ottawa municipal election, Harb, who was a Liberal MP and had supported fiscally conservative, pro-business candidate Jacquelin Holzman, admitted to &quot;quietly encourag[ing]&quot; Marc Laviolette to enter the race to split the vote, because he &quot;couldn&#x27;t stomach Smith&#x27;s left-wing social agenda&quot; and the thought of Nancy Smith winning.

== Senate expense scandal ==
On December 6, 2012, Harb was named in relation to the Canadian Senate expenses scandal due to expenses for a property in Pembroke, Ontario. In May 2013, the Senate Internal Economy Committee found that Harb had incorrectly claimed $51,482.92 of living and travel expenses and ordered him to repay it, which was done by July 5, 2013. The committee had earlier advised Harb to repay $231,000 of claimed expenses dating back to 2005 to avoid an extensive audit into his finances. Harb stated that his repayment was done &quot;under protest&quot; since he intended to challenge the validity of the committee&#x27;s findings in the Ontario Divisional Court. On August 26, 2013, he repaid a further $180,166.17, for a total reimbursement of $231,649.07, after which he resigned his Senate seat. In February 2014, Harb was charged with fraud and breach of trust in connection with these expense claims. Those charges were later withdrawn by the Crown in May 2016, after the acquittal of Senator Mike Duffy on his own expense-related criminal charges.

<text>The International Council of Community Churches (ICCC) is a Christian religious association of ecumenically co-operating Protestants and Independent Catholics. Based in Loudon, TN in the United States, it is the main organization of the Community Church movement. The ICCC is a member of Churches Uniting in Christ, the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA and the World Council of Churches. In 2010, the ICCC had 148 congregations with 68,300 members. Membership is concentrated primarily in the Midwest. However, there are several congregations in California, New York, and Florida. According to the World Council of Churches, the council has 108,806 members worldwide.

==History==
In 1950, the biennial council of the Peoples Church of Christ and Community Centers led by Joseph M. Evans (until then all Afro-American) and the National Council of Community Churches led by the Rev. Roy A. Burkhardt (until then all Caucasian) joined in a historic merger. At the time, their joining represented the largest interracial merger of religious bodies in America. The new creation was the International Council of Community Churches. Member churches united to be a fellowship of ecumenically minded, freedom-loving congregations cooperating in fulfilling the mission of the church in the world. As a post-denominational movement, the council has witnessed and worked for Christian unity, justice and reconciliation in human society.

==Polity==
Local congregations own the council and determine its emphases and operation. They do so by sending delegates to an annual conference. Each local church is entitled to two voting delegates, of which both may be laity or one each lay and clergy (but not two clergy.) Decisions about council policy are made by the local church delegates voting at the annual conference. Delegates elect a volunteer board. The board hires and supervises staff and oversees everyday operations. The Rev. Bruce N. Merton is the current executive director. The president is the Rev. Robert Fread. 

=== Constitution and bylaws ===
The ICCC use a constitution and bylaws to help govern the operation of the annual conference. These were last amended in 2019.

<doc id="1250626" wikidata="Q7438642" url="?curid=1250626" title="Scouts Australia">
<text>Scouts Australia is a trading name of The Scout Association of Australia, which is the largest scouting organisation in Australia, with over 50,000 Youth Program Participants, and is a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. It was formed in 1958 and incorporated in 1967. It operates personal development programs for children and young adults from 5 to 25 years of age with programs successively opened to girls after 1971.

The organisation&#x27;s current stated purpose is to &quot;contribute to the development of young people in achieving their full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual potentials as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members of their local, national and international communities&quot;.

Participation in the organisation&#x27;s programs declined in the late 20th and early 21st centuries despite opening participation to girls and ever younger children and Australia having a high population growth rate, well above the world average. According to a 2014 media article, &quot;Scouts Australia is hoping [to] arrest a steady decline in membership. In 1979 the organisation had 114,500 youth members, today there are 52,000.&quot; According to its own annual reports participation decreased from 84,502 in 2,126 groups in 2001 to 63,200 in 1,836 groups in 2005, while in 2012 there were 49,181 children and youth, 2,587 young adult Rovers and 14,113 adult leaders and support roles in 1,486 groups and, in 2022, there were 48,796 children and youths, 2,792 young adult Rovers and 15,147 adult leaders and support roles in 1,321 groups. The organisation has an exceptionally high number of adults compared to its number of youth participants with a ratio of more than one adult for every three youths.

== Structure ==
Scouts Australia is a council which is not elected by, representative of or accountable to the Scouts, the adults in Scouting or Scout groups. The council consists of a majority of members elected by the council itself, office bearers appointed by the council or its national executive committee, state and territory office bearers appointed by the national executive committee and a smaller number of representatives from state and territory branch councils which are similarly not elected by, representative of or accountable to the Scouts, the adults in Scouting or Scout groups. The council usually meets just once a year. Real control lies with its national executive committee. Its national executive committee sets policy and programs and coordinates its state and territory branches.

The New South Wales, Victorian and Tasmanian state branches are incorporated under special Acts of the state parliaments. while the Western Australian, South Australian, Queensland, Northern Territory, and Australian Capital Territory branches are incorporated by registration under the ordinary Associations Incorporation Acts. Each state or territory branch maintains its distinct structure, operational methods, and rules. However, all branches operate the same programs for children and young adults under a common uniform and common award scheme structure set by the national executive committee.

The national executive committee appoints the organisation&#x27;s Chief Scout, currently David Hurley, the Governor-General of Australia. In the past, the organisation&#x27;s positions of chief scouts and state branch chief scouts had usually been held, respectively, by the governor-general or governor of the state. When he was the governor-general from 1989 to 1996, Bill Hayden declined to be the organisation&#x27;s chief scout. In 2015, the actor Shane Jacobson was appointed as the Chief Scout of the Victorian branch. The organisations position of Chief Scout of its Australian Capital Territory branch was allowed to lapse and has been left vacant. In 1942, Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, the Governor of Queensland, resigned as the Boy Scouts Association&#x27;s Chief Scout of Queensland because of the failure of the Queensland branch to respond to his call for reforms to its centralisation effort that led to the severance of the Mount Morgan Blue Boy Scouts.

== History ==

For the history of Boy Scouts and the Scout Movement in Australia generally, see Scouting and Guiding in Australia.

The organisation was formed in 1958 under the name &quot;&#x27; Australian Boy Scouts Association&quot;, as a branch of the Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom. Before its formation, branches of the Boy Scouts Association had been formed in each Australian state. Initially, each Australian state branch was directly responsible to the Imperial Headquarters of the Boy Scouts Association in London. In 1922, the Boy Scouts Association formed its Australian Federal Council, consisting of nominees of its Australian state branches, to achieve cooperation and coordination at a national level. The Boy Scouts Association later appointed an Australian commissioner. The Australian Federal Council functioned as a branch of the Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom, and the Australian commissioner was appointed by the Imperial Headquarters in London. The Australian Federal Council of the Boy Scouts Association became a member of the International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement in 1953, rather than being represented through the Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom. In 1958, when the Australian Boy Scouts Association was formed, it succeeded the Australian Federal Council of the Boy Scouts Association.

In 1967, the organisation was incorporated by royal charter as a branch of the Scout Association of the United Kingdom. Each of the Australian state branches and the Papua New Guinea branch of the Scout Association became branches of the Australian Boy Scouts Association. In 1975, the organisation&#x27;s Papua New Guinea branch became an independent organisation.

In 1971, the organisation dropped the word &quot;boy&quot; from its name when it changed its name from the Australian Boy Scouts Association to the Scout Association of Australia. Until 1976, it admitted only British Subjects to membership and programs and other nationalities only on special conditions and approval. After 1976, British subjects continued to be automatically admitted to membership while foreign subjects, including residents were still subject to special conditions and approval.

In 1997, the organisation adopted the trading name Scouts Australia.

=== Program reviews ===

In 1969 the organisation began a review of its youth programs under its Design for Tomorrow Committee and implemented its New Design program in 1971. The program involved a new name, new branding, new uniforms, and new award schemes. It failed to attract an increase in participants and led to considerable disaffection and loss of long-term leaders and supporters and the formation of Australian affiliates of the traditionalist Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association while its decline in participation continued.

In 1979, following years of disaffection and concerns that the organisation, like its parent organisation in the United Kingdom, would disband Rovers, the organisation formed its national Rover council, composed of Rovers (ages 18 to 25), appointed by each of its seven branch Rover councils. The national Rover council elects an executive to represent Rovers in the organisation&#x27;s affairs and the chairperson of the National Rover Council is a member of the organisation&#x27;s national executive committee.

In 1997, the organisation adopted the new trading name Scouts Australia, new logo, uniforms, and branding to be more appealing, but participation rates and numbers continued to decline.

In 2001, the organisation formed its National Youth Council in an attempt to engage youth and provide opportunities for youth leadership at its national level. It was composed of just 25 Scouts, Venturers, and Rovers, met face to face twice a year and online throughout the rest of the year. Despite this, youth participation rates and numbers continued to decline. The National Youth Council was disbanded in 2018.

A further program review commenced in 2013. In 2019, at the 25th Australian Scout Jamboree a new program and logo and branding were launched, with the intention of modernising Scouts Australia&#x27;s brand, and moving Scouting more in line with Australian curriculums.

== Religion ==

Scouts Australia is a non-religious organisation. To enrol with Scouts Australia you are required to make the Scout Promise. In 2017, with the launch of &quot;The Adventure Begins&quot;, a new promise option allows Scouts to &quot;do my best to be true to my &quot;spiritual beliefs&quot;&quot;, to further open the promise to all religious faiths. The other more established option for the Australian Scout Promise includes the phrase &quot;do my best to do my duty to &quot;my&quot; God&quot;, allowing some flexibility in the interpretation of &quot;my God&quot;.

Historically, Scouting in Australia was rooted in Christianity as that was the world view of Scouts founder, Lord Baden-Powell. Although Britain is now a majority non-religious nation Christianity was the dominant faith in both Britain and Australia in Scouting&#x27;s early days.

More recently, participants have come from many faiths, although the majority of Scout groups promote an interfaith approach to religion. Many Scout groups have been formed within existing communities and specific religious traditions as &quot;sponsored groups&quot;, such as Coptic Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Islamic and Jewish.

== Scout Promise and Law ==
=== Scout Promise ===
There are two versions of the Australian Scout Promise which individuals may choose to select: 

Option One: 

On my honour, 

I promise to do my best, 

To do my duty to my God and 

To the King of Australia, 

To help other people, 

And to live by the Scout Law. 

Option Two: 

On my honour, I promise 

To do my best, 

To be true to my spiritual beliefs, 

To contribute to my community and our world, 

To help other people, 

And to live by the Scout Law.

=== Scout Law ===
Be Respectful - 
Be friendly and considerate. 
Care for others and the environment. 

Do What is Right - 
Be trustworthy, honest and fair.
Use resources wisely. 

Believe in Myself - 
Learn from my experiences. 
Face challenges with courage.

== Children and youth programs ==
=== Age sections ===
Youth development in the organisation&#x27;s programs is divided into several age group stages. The age groups encourage movement through the sections as the youth matures. The sections are:

* Joey Scouts (5–7 years): helping to develop a child&#x27;s sense of personal identity. Motto: Discover Adventure
* Cub Scouts (8–10 years): aims to develop a sense of adventure and achievement and a chance to grow their character. Motto: Create the Path
* Scouts (11–14 years): promotes leadership and teamwork, as well as an appreciation of the outdoors. Motto: Explore the Unknown
* Venturer Scouts (15–17 years): develops leadership and management skills, as well as an understanding of camping and the environment. Motto: Look Wide
* Rover Scouts (18–25 years): continues to develop leadership skills, as well as placing a strong emphasis on service to the community and other parts of the organisation. Motto: Beyond the Horizon
=== Uniform ===
The core uniform is a navy blue shirt with the relevant youth section colour across the sleeves and collar, a scarf, and a woggle. The adult leader&#x27;s shirt is only dark blue.

The section colours are:

* Tan for Joeys
* Yellow for Cubs
* Green for Scouts
* Maroon for Venturers
* Red for Rovers

=== Award scheme ===
The youth award scheme in Australian Scouting consists of awards for proficiency in an adventurous activity, participation in major events, recognition of service, gallantry and meritorious service, and for the practice of Scouting (Queen&#x27;s Scout, Baden-Powell Award, etc.).

The peak award for each section is the Joey Scout Promise Award, Grey Wolf Award, Australian Scout Award, Queen&#x27;s Scout Award, and Baden-Powell Scout Award respectively. (The &#x27;Queen&#x27;s Scout Award&#x27; may be renamed as the &#x27;King&#x27;s Scout Award&#x27;, if King Charles III accepts Royal Patronage of the Scout Association of Australia after May 2023.)

=== Lone Scouts ===
Lone Scout Groups are for youth unable to attend or find a local Scout group. Lones can include people with impairments that inhibit attending regular meetings, people who are constant travellers or go to places at which they are unable to attend a group i.e. boarding school or isolated communities. Lone Scout Groups may hold camps or other gatherings to enable their members to come together but, between such events, deliver Scouting virtually via internet, radio and post.

=== International connections ===

The organisation operates in the non-sovereign Australian Indian Ocean Territories of:
* Christmas Island
* Cocos (Keeling) Islands

Two Scout troops in Singapore are affiliated with the organisation.

The organisation is a founder member of the Asia-Pacific Region of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. In the field of support and co-operation with other national member organisations of the Asia Pacific region, the organisation has contributed to a number of international friendship and community development-oriented projects. Over the years, Australian Scouts have supported emerging Scout organisations in the South Pacific. A twinning project with the Bangladesh Scouts, known as the &quot;Bangladesh-Australia Child Health&quot; (BACH) project, made a dramatic impact on child health in project villages during its operation from 1986 to 1992. The organisation has a twinning project with the Nepal Scouts known as NATURE Project and involves the reforestation of the Kristi Landslide.

In 1988 the organisation hosted the 16th World Scout Jamboree and the 31st World Scout Conference. Some 15,000 Scouts from 94 countries attended the jamboree at Cataract Scout Park near Sydney. An Australian Scout Jamboree has been held every three years since 1934 except for the years of the Second World War. The Scout Jamboree is the organisation&#x27;s largest event but an Australian Rover Moot and an Australian Venture are also held every three years.

== Adult training and awards ==

Training institute

In 1996 Scouts Australia became a registered training organisation (RTO), trading as the Scouts Australia Institute of Training (SAIT). Scouts Australia&#x27;s adult leader training program now leads adults and Rover Scouts to a Certificate III in Business and a Certificate IV in Leadership and Management, as well as the Scouting Woodbadge qualification. Woodbadge Leaders and Rovers can then undertake the Diploma of Leadership and Management qualification through SAIT.

In 2011, the institute added a number of the SIS10 qualifications to its scope, and changes are occurring in the individual state branches to allow Adventurous Activity Leader training to also lead to the Certificate IV in Outdoor Recreation. Adventurous Activities Leaders are leaders who specialise in the running of advanced adventurous activities, such as abseiling, rock climbing, scuba diving and mountain biking, as opposed to the everyday running of a Scout group and more basic activities such as camping and hiking.

Adult Recognition Awards

Adult Recognition Awards (formerly Good Service Awards) are presented each year by the Chief Scout of each branch and are presented for service to Scouting over and above what is expected of someone who is simply carrying out the duties of their position. These awards can be nominated by anyone affiliated with Scouts Australia.



== Awards for gallantry and meritorious conduct ==
Awards for Gallantry are made by the Chief Scout of Australia for actions involving risk, for example for saving someone from a burning building to individual participants or groups.

Awards for meritorious conduct are awarded for actions that may not have involved risking of life but still display courage, endurance, initiative, or devotion to duty, often under suffering. As with Awards for Gallantry, these awards are made by the Chief Scout of Australia to individuals or groups depending on the circumstances.

== Sexual abuse cases ==
Scouts Australia was called before the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse for its failures in handling complaints against its leaders.

In 2014, Darryl Rubiolo, a former Scout Association of Australia leader, publicity officer, leader trainer, St. George Area Commissioner and member of the New South Wales state branch council, was convicted of serial child sex offences against three boys aged 9, 13 and 14, between 1975 and 1987 while he was an official of the Scout Association of Australia. Rubiolo was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison with a non-parole period of one year.

In 2012, Steven Larkins, a former leader in New South Wales, was imprisoned for offences he had committed 15 years earlier.

In February 2000, Roderick Albert Joseph Corrie, a former NSW Branch Commissioner and scout leader of nearly thirty-two years was convicted of child sexual offences. &quot;Corrie, one of the most senior and highly decorated Scouts in NSW, was jailed for seven years in February 2000 after pleading guilty in the District Court to eight most serious of 77 charges of sexually abusing children as young as 11, including rape and buggery, occurring 1969–1995. Two years earlier, Corrie had been convicted of eight charges of &quot;aggravated indecent assault&quot; and placed on a bond, given counselling and 70 hours of community service.&quot; The head of Scouts Australia, &quot;Dr. Bruce Munro, apologised to the families of those abused after &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; obtained a copy of a 14-page report written by a senior Scout leader in 1981 that detailed serious allegations of Corrie abusing four boys, one aged 12 at the time. Munro admitted that those allegations were not properly investigated or referred to the police and that although Corrie was initially suspended, he was then simply allowed to transfer as a leader to a North Shore Scouting group. Even after police began investigating Corrie in 1994, he was allowed to continue having contact with, and sexually abusing, scouts until at least May 1995.&quot;

Mark Geoffrey Fisher, the scoutmaster at 1st Hunters Hill troop in New South Wales from 1969 to 1988, pleaded guilty to charges of 35 sex offences involving eight boys aged between 11 and 15 between 1971 and 1988.

In 2017, former scout leader Neville Budge was convicted of sexually abusing eight young boys between the years of 1995 and 2002, whilst working as a Scout leader in the Belmont and Geelong district, Victoria. The court referred to his manipulative and predatory actions, labelling his crimes as being &quot;simply abhorrent&quot;.

In 2017, former scout leader Chris Edmondson was convicted of the sexual abuse of three young boys between 1975 and 1978 in Warrandyte. On one occasion he sexually abused a young boy for having not known a test answer. Edmondson was jailed in Queensland in 2006, released in 2012, then jailed in Victoria in 2015 again, had his sentence extended in 2016 and would have been eligible for parole in January 2019. The outcome of the proceedings is unclear to date.

Former scout leader Kim Richard Harvey was jailed for the sexual abuse of 15 teenage boys in Melbourne&#x27;s South Eastern suburbs between the years of 1974 and 1989. Harvey&#x27;s behaviour posed a uniquely disturbing pattern, whereby premeditated grooming was a natural part of his &#x27;game&#x27;, often plying his victims with alcohol, lollies, and pornography. Harvey&#x27;s crimes were not just isolated to local scout halls but continued throughout various camping trips, and activities in his role as a leader with Scouts Victoria.

Since then, Scouts Australia put child safety training and procedures in place to try to protect the children under their care.

<text>In mathematical logic, the calculus of structures is a proof calculus with deep inference for studying the structural proof theory of noncommutative logic. The calculus has since been applied to study linear logic, classical logic, modal logic, and process calculi, and many benefits are claimed to follow in these investigations from the way in which deep inference is made available in the calculus.

<doc id="1250647" wikidata="Q453153" url="?curid=1250647" title="Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus">
<text>Monty Python&#x27;s Fliegender Zirkus (&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;) is a pair of 45-minute Monty Python German television comedy specials produced by WDR for West German television. The two episodes were respectively first broadcast in January and December 1972 and were shot entirely on film and mostly on location in Bavaria, with the first episode recorded in German and the second recorded in English and then dubbed into German.

== Production ==

While visiting the UK in the early 1970s, German entertainer and TV producer Alfred Biolek became aware of the Pythons and, excited by their innovative and absurd sketches, invited them to Germany in 1971 to write a special German episode of their &quot;Flying Circus&quot; show and to act in them. Despite mixed audience reception, a second episode was produced in 1972.

According to producer Biolek, the Pythons were initially somewhat reluctant to the idea of going to Germany to produce comedy for a German audience. Biolek had only seen a few shows, but he was impressed with the concept of the Flying Circus. Specifically, it stood out to him that they were both good comedians and good actors—a combination that Biolek rarely saw in the German comedy scene at the time. Biolek arranged to meet with the Pythons in the BBC&#x27;s bar in London to convince them &quot;with many arguments and even more gin and tonics&quot; to come to Germany for a brief visit. Eric Idle has described the conception of the specials as &quot;The Germans came to us and said &#x27;Look, we haven&#x27;t got a sense of humour, but we understand you do. Can we use yours? Terry Jones recalled Biolek&#x27;s inquiry as an opportunity &quot;to do silly things in Germany&quot;.

The Pythons agreed to visit Biolek in Munich in order to explore options for possible material, but did not want to commit at this point. During their visit, the troupe wanted to get a better understanding of German culture and humour. In fact, the visit, and the resulting two shows &quot;can be viewed as a considered attempt to broaden the stereotypical picture of Germans&quot; by the Pythons. Michael Palin also noted, &quot;All I know is that it reversed all one&#x27;s prejudices. Python has done very, very well in Germany, and the movies do extremely well. ... Whenever anyone says, you know, the Germans have no sense of humour, say no, hang on, hang on, they got Monty Python before a lot of other countries.&quot; During their visit to Germany, the Pythons attended the Oktoberfest and Olympiastadion in Munich, and also visited nearby Dachau concentration camp. The Pythons&#x27; visit to Germany in 1971 coincided with the widely celebrated 500th birthday of painter Albrecht Dürer, and the group&#x27;s second visit with the highly anticipated 1972 Summer Olympics. Both events had an obvious impact on the material created by the Pythons for their first episode, including the &quot;Silly Olympics&quot; skit, and the &quot;Anita Ekberg Sings Albrecht Dürer&quot; skit, thus situating their style of humour in a local cultural context.

&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Fliegender Zirkus&quot; was produced by Biolek and translator Thomas Woitkewitsch in co-production with Westdeutscher Rundfunk. The first episode was written in English, and then translated by Woitkewitsch. However, translating humour within this transnational production—especially when based on idioms—was a general challenge, as Palin recalls.

Since none of the Pythons spoke German sufficiently, Woitkewitsch needed to provide them with phonetic transcriptions of the skits, which they then needed to learn by heart. Jones recalled that this posed a considerable challenge to the troupe; he also mentions that because of the rigorous repetition required in production, he was still able to recite the German version of &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; over 40 years later. 
Despite the coaching and re-iterative translation efforts, the Pythons&#x27; accents remained rather strong, and according to Woitkewitsch the overall pacing was off. While these language issues may have contributed to the first show&#x27;s weak critical reception, Woitkewitsch suggests that they also lent it a &quot;secret charm&quot;.

These troubles with troupe members&#x27; timing and German accents led to their recording the second episode in English; only John Cleese and Palin delivered their lines in German well enough to be easily understood by native speakers. The other Python performers all had very thick accents (particularly Jones), making them difficult to understand. In some cases the episode was broadcast with German subtitles.

The second episode was the final television show that Cleese recorded with the group, having already announced his decision to only commit to film and stage productions in future. The episode also featured Terry Gilliam taking more acting roles than before.

== Sketches ==
The &quot;Colin &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris vs Colin &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris&quot; and &quot;Hearing Aid Shop&quot; sketches in the second show had previously featured in &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;.

Footage of the &quot;Silly Olympics,&quot; &quot;Little Red Riding Hood,&quot; &quot;Flashers&#x27; Love Story,&quot; and &quot;The Philosophers&#x27; Football Match&quot; sketches from these German specials was regularly used to fill time between live stage performances, as seen in &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; (the former two re-dubbed in English). &quot;Silly Olympics&quot; (minus the relay for the deaf part) and &quot;The Philosophers&#x27; Football Match&quot; were also used in the 2014 reunion shows at London&#x27;s O2 Arena.

Several new sketches were written specifically for this show, including &quot;William Tell&quot;, &quot;Little Red Riding Hood,&quot; and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; as performed by a herd of cows. Only &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; was translated from its original appearance on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; (Series 1, Episode 9), although &quot;Ten Seconds of Sex&quot; from the second show also appeared in Series 3, Episode 9 of &quot;Flying Circus&quot; around the same time.

Both Alfred Biolek and Thomas Woitkewitsch are featured in guest roles. German footballer Franz Beckenbauer makes an appearance in The Philosophers&#x27; Football Match skit. The first skit of the first episode also features Claudia Doren, then an announcer at Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR).

==Episodes==
==Reception==
The first show received mixed reviews. Opinion surveys taken after the episode was broadcast revealed that 8% of the audience found the show to be very good, 15% found it to be very bad, and 43% found it to be good. Producer Biolek recalled that &quot;This [the first show] was an absolute flop, it cannot be stated differently, as well as in terms of viewership and especially in terms of reviews.&quot; Biolek retrospectively believes that the German audience was not ready for Pythonesque humour, since it was more used to more traditional sketch comedy, by comedians such as Rudi Carrell and Heinz Erhardt. In fact, the producers did expect early on that especially the older parts of the German audience would not connect with the Pythons&#x27; style of humour.
Biolek attributes the production of the second show to Westdeutscher Rundfunk&#x27;s general progressive stance towards entertainment production at the time, and specifically to the support of the head of the entertainment sector, Hannes Hoff.

== Alternative Versions ==
The versions of the two episodes released on home video outside Germany differ from the versions aired on ARD. The ARD version of the first episode is missing the 6-minute &quot;Bavarian Restaurant&quot; sketch. The ARD version of the second episode trims some shots, mostly from &#x27;The Tale of Happy Valley&#x27; sketch. On the other hand, the ARD version also features two sequences missing from the DVD version: &#x27;Schwimmkurs mit Arthur Lustgarten&#x27; &quot;(Swimming Course with Arthur Lustgarten)&quot; and &#x27;Eine wichtige Information für Raucher&#x27; &quot;(An Important Information for Smokers)&quot;. Also, in the ARD version, Eric Idle&#x27;s &#x27;I Want A Hearing Aid&#x27; sketch has been moved to the end of the episode.

== Media ==
Guerilla Films released both episodes on a single VHS tape in 1998, available in either PAL or NTSC format. The American A&amp;E Network used this release as the basis of their DVD releases of the same material, with the first episode being included on &quot;Monty Python Live&quot; and the second episode included on &quot;The Life of Python&quot;. (This arrangement resulted in the second episode being omitted from A&amp;E&#x27;s otherwise-complete 16-DVD box set of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.)

The Australian DVD company Rainbow Entertainment also released both episodes on one DVD.

The Swiss publisher Haffmans released a hardbound book containing the scripts of both episodes, with introductions and essays by the German producers, in 1998.

Both episodes have been shown on the Paramount Comedy Channel in the UK and on PBS in the US in 2007.

As of April 2018, both episodes are available for streaming on Netflix. In December 2023 they were added to BritBox UK and ITVX.

The German DVD label Pidax has released the German DVD of the series in 2018. Episode 1 is featured in German language only; Episode 2 has German and English audio (with previously cut scenes being in English with German subtitles). The German TV-exclusive sketches of Episode 2, &quot;&#x27;Schwimmkurs mit Arthur Lustgarten&#x27;&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Eine wichtige Information für Raucher&quot;&#x27; are contained as separate bonus features; also, the German TV cut of &#x27;The Tale of Happy Valley&#x27; sketch is available as a bonus feature.

== Lost sketches ==
Several behind-the-scenes photos from the specials&#x27; production were published in the group&#x27;s autobiography, some of which were from sketches cut from the specials:
* A version of the &quot;Marriage Guidance Counsellor&quot; sketch.
* A sketch involving a flute player (Graham Chapman) in front of a German sign.
* A version of the &quot;Sir Edward Ross&quot; sketch
* An alternate ending to the first special, in which two stage hands are carrying a giant sign that says ENDE off a huge field. Behind the sign is Terry Jones&#x27; singer character from the Albrecht Dürer sketch.

<text>WLBZ (channel 2) is a television station in Bangor, Maine, United States, affiliated with NBC and owned by Tegna Inc. The station&#x27;s studios are located on Mount Hope Avenue in Bangor, and its transmitter is located on Rider Bluff in Holden.

Although identifying as a separate station in its own right, WLBZ is considered a semi-satellite of sister station WCSH (channel 6) in Portland. WLBZ&#x27;s master control, as well as some internal operations, are housed at WCSH&#x27;s studios on Congress Square in Downtown Portland. WLBZ clears all network programming as provided through its parent, simulcasts most of WCSH&#x27;s newscasts (with local weather inserts) and airs most of its syndicated programming (though in some cases at different times). There are also some programs that only air on WLBZ while some are only seen on WCSH. WLBZ also airs separate station identifications and commercial inserts. Although WLBZ and WCSH are based in different locations and technically serve separate markets, the two essentially operate as one station. With their combined resources, the stations provide statewide coverage not offered by any other outlet in Maine.

WLBZ previously served as the default NBC affiliate for the Presque Isle market, which did not have an affiliate of its own. It is carried in the local tier of Spectrum&#x27;s cable system in Presque Isle, and is also offered as the NBC affiliate in the Presque Isle Dish Network and DirecTV channel lineups. This changed in 2020, however, with the sign-on of NBC affiliate WWPI-LD by CBS/Fox/CW+ affiliate (and sister station of rival WABI-TV) WAGM-TV. In addition to its main signal, WLBZ operates low-power digital repeater WGCI-LD on VHF channel 4. Licensed to Skowhegan, this station has a transmitter in Norridgewock&#x27;s Larone section. 

==History==
The station began broadcasting on September 12, 1954, as WTWO (sometimes rendered as &quot;W-TWO&quot;), an independent station locally owned by Murray Carpenter. The following January, it began carrying some CBS programming, becoming a full affiliate by September 1955 (prior to this, CBS programming was seen on WABI-TV (channel 5), which became a primary NBC affiliate). In 1958, WTWO was sold to the Rines family&#x27;s Maine Broadcasting System, owner of WLBZ radio (620 AM), WCSH-AM-TV in Portland, and WRDO in Augusta. The new ownership changed the station&#x27;s call letters to WLBZ-TV that June to match its new radio sister (which the Rines had owned since 1944). (The WTWO calls now reside on the NBC affiliate in Terre Haute, Indiana.) The following year, channel 2 swapped affiliations with WABI-TV and joined NBC in order to match WCSH-TV; the two stations also began to share a secondary ABC affiliation (previously, ABC programming was only cleared on WABI). The ABC arrangement remained in place until 1965, when WEMT (channel 7, now WVII-TV) signed on as a full-time ABC affiliate.

In its first decades on the air, channel 2 was best known as the home of Eddie Driscoll. He hosted many programs on the station including &quot;Weird&quot;, &quot;Dialing for Dollars&quot;, &quot;The Great Money Movie&quot;, and &quot;My Backyard&quot;. Driscoll was also known for his improvisation skills and sense of humor. He retired from WLBZ-TV in 1986, and died on September 24, 2006, after suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

In the 1970s, WLBZ-TV added a repeater in Calais, W57AQ on channel 57, with a transmitter in Meddybemps shared with W61AO (which repeated WABI-TV). W57AQ allowed cable systems in Atlantic Canada to distribute WLBZ by a microwave link from the border, doubling or even tripling the station&#x27;s coverage area and viewership. Most Canadian cable systems dropped WLBZ after 1996 once American television signals became available to them by satellite, with the last one doing so in 2010. Although a &quot;flash-cut&quot; to digital on VHF channel 8 was considered, it was instead decided to return the W57AQ license to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which deleted it on April 29, 2010.

In 1981, WLBZ radio was sold off, becoming WACZ (it is now WZON); in 1997, the -TV suffix was dropped. In 1998, the Maine Broadcasting System (by this time controlled by the Rines-Thompson family) sold WLBZ and WCSH to the Gannett Company. In 2000, the station essentially began serving as a semi-satellite of WCSH, when commercials and network programming began to be played from Portland. However, as early as 1989, WLBZ had been reducing its personnel and consolidating some internal operations with WCSH.

In 2002, WLBZ signed on a digital signal on UHF channel 25, bringing NBC&#x27;s high definition programming to Eastern and Central Maine. WLBZ&#x27;s broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009. However, the station kept its digital operations on channel 25 until September 10, when it was moved to the VHF channel 2 space previously occupied by the analog service.

In 2012, WLBZ&#x27;s station logo was immortalized in a running sketch series for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; called &quot;Maine Justice&quot;, a parody of courtroom shows featuring a judge and a bailiff with Louisiana accents who &quot;try&quot; to act like New Englanders. The sketch returned later that season, namely the March 9, 2013, episode.

This aired in the same year Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish&#x27;s AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for WLBZ. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations (such as WLBZ) should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement. The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.

On June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. WCSH and WLBZ were retained by the latter company, named Tegna.

==News operation==
Originally, WLBZ operated its own news department and produced local newscasts from its Bangor studios. For most of its history, it was a solid, if distant, second in Nielsen ratings behind WABI. In 1989, WLBZ began simulcasting some of WCSH&#x27;s newscasts prepared with a statewide view. Initially, this was limited to morning, noon, and weekend newscasts; however, on June 26, 2000, WLBZ dropped its 5:30 p.m. newscast in favor of WCSH&#x27;s newscast, with the 11 p.m. newscast following suit on September 11. WLBZ still aired separate newscasts covering Bangor weeknights at 5 and 6 (which were locally produced at its facilities), with all other newscasts originating from the WCSH studios in Portland. By 2015, the 5 p.m. newscast had also been converted to a simulcast; on October 8, 2015, the 6 p.m. newscast, WLBZ&#x27;s last standalone newscast, was discontinued and replaced with a WCSH-produced newscast. As mentioned, these statewide programs tend to take on a regional feel with coverage from Portland, Bangor, or wherever news occurs around the state. During the weeknight newscasts, WLBZ still produces its own weather forecast segments from Bangor with meteorologist Steve McKay. On August 9, 2010, there was an expansion of the statewide weekday morning show to 4:30 with the new segment being called &quot;News Center Early Morning Report&quot;.

WLBZ and WCSH have used the &quot;News Center&quot; branding for their newscasts since the 1970s, even before consolidating. Additionally, both stations featured Frank Gari&#x27;s &quot;Good News&quot; music package from 1986 until October 22, 2008, when it was dropped (except during &quot;Storm Center&quot; coverage) in favor of standardized music and graphics seen on other Gannett stations.

After then-WB affiliate WPXT in Portland shut down its news department in Fall 2002, WLBZ and WCSH entered into a news share agreement with that station resulting in a nightly prime time newscast. Originally called &quot;News Center at 10 on Maine&#x27;s WB 51&quot;, it was seen every night for thirty minutes. On weeknights, news and sports segments originated from WCSH&#x27;s facilities while WLBZ produced the weather segment from its studios. Weekend broadcasts aired entirely from Portland. &quot;News Center at 10&quot; was formatted in a similar manner to the statewide shows simulcasted on WLBZ and WCSH except for having a slight Portland focus since WPXT was that market&#x27;s WB affiliate. In September 2006, the production became known as &quot;News Center at 10 on The CW Portland&quot; after WPXT switched to The CW. WLBZ&#x27;s role in the newscast was eliminated on November 6, 2008, when WCSH moved the prime time broadcast to its &quot;News Center Weather Plus&quot; feed and entirely reoriented the newscast to the Portland market (with WLBZ no longer doing the weather forecast). The &quot;News Center Weather Plus&quot; feed on WLBZ-DT2 and the live video on their websites was replaced with the national Weather Plus service. &quot;News Center at 10&quot; was eventually canceled by WCSH after a six-year run.

An outdoors and human-interest program called &quot;Bill Green&#x27;s Maine&quot; airs Saturday nights at 7 on WCSH and WLBZ. In 2003, WCSH launched &quot;207&quot;, a local lifestyle/entertainment magazine-type show which airs weeknights at 7 pm on both stations simultaneously. The &quot;207&quot; name comes from Maine&#x27;s telephone area code.

In October 2005, WLBZ and WCSH began offering NBC Weather Plus on new second digital subchannels. Known as &quot;News Center Weather Plus&quot;, the service could also be seen on the websites of both stations through live streaming video and digital cable. In late-December 2008 as a result of Weather Plus closing on a national level, WLBZ-DT2 and WCSH-DT2 shifted to a format featuring a loop of local news headlines and weather forecasts. The service retained the &quot;News Center Weather Plus&quot; branding and digital cable carriage but the online live video was dropped. WCSH&#x27;s weeknight meteorologist Joe Cupo can sometimes be seen on &quot;News Center Weather Plus&quot; providing statewide weather forecasts. Like the main signal, WGCI offers &quot;News Center Weather Plus&quot; on its second digital subchannel. As of February 2014, the channel no longer broadcasts on television.

In addition to the main studios in Bangor and Portland, WLBZ and WCSH share two bureaus in the state. This includes the Midcoast Bureau (on Camden Street/US 1) in Rockport and the Lewiston–Auburn Bureau (on Main Street/ME 11/ME 100/US 202) in Lewiston.

In January 2018, WLBZ and its sister station WCSH rebranded their newscasts under the &quot;News Center Maine&quot; moniker.

On June 1, 2020, WLBZ and WCSH premiered an hour-long weekday newscast at 4 p.m.

<doc id="1250649" wikidata="Q142617" url="?curid=1250649" title="Tata Institute of Fundamental Research">
<text>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) is a leading research Institute under the Department of Atomic Energy of the Government of India. It is a public deemed university located at Navy Nagar, Colaba in Mumbai. It also has a centres in Bangalore, Pune and Hyderabad. TIFR conducts research primarily in the natural sciences, the biological sciences and theoretical computer science.

==History==
Homi J. Bhabha, known for his role in the development of the Indian atomic energy programme, wrote to the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust requesting financial assistance to set up a scientific research institute. With support from J.R.D. Tata, then chairman of the Tata Group, TIFR was founded on 1 June 1945, and Homi Bhabha was appointed its first director. The institute initially operated within the campus of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore before relocating to Mumbai later that year. TIFR&#x27;s new campus in Colaba was designed by Chicago-based architect Helmuth Bartsch and was inaugurated by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on 15 January 1962.

Shortly after Indian Independence, in 1949, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) designated TIFR to be the centre for all large-scale projects in nuclear research. The first theoretical physics group was set up by Bhabha&#x27;s students B.M. Udgaonkar and K.S. Singhvi. In December 1950, Bhabha organised an international conference at TIFR on elementary particle physics. Several world-renowned scientists attended the conference, including Rudolf Peierls, Léon Rosenfeld, William Fowler as well as Meghnad Saha, Vikram Sarabhai and others providing expertise from India. In the 1950s, TIFR gained prominence in the field of cosmic ray physics, with the setting up of research facilities in Ooty and in the Kolar gold mines.

In 1957, India&#x27;s first digital computer, TIFRAC was built in TIFR. Acting on the suggestions of British physiologist Archibald Hill, Bhabha invited Obaid Siddiqi to set up a research group in molecular biology. This ultimately resulted in the establishment of the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore twenty years later. In 1970, TIFR started research in radio astronomy with the setting up of the Ooty Radio Telescope. Encouraged by the success of ORT, Govind Swarup persuaded J. R. D. Tata to help set up the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope near Pune, India.

TIFR attained the official deemed university status in June 2002. To meet the ever-growing demand of space needed for research labs and accommodation institute is coming up with a new campus at Hyderabad.

==Research==
Research at TIFR is distributed across three schools, working over the mathematical sciences, natural sciences, technology and computer science.

===School of Mathematics===
Since its birth in the 1950s, several contributions to mathematics have come from TIFR School of Mathematics. Notable contributions from TIFR mathematicians include Raghavan Narasimhan&#x27;s proof of the embedding of open Riemann surfaces in formula_1, C. S. Seshadri&#x27;s work on projective modules over polynomial rings and M. S. Narasimhan&#x27;s results in the theory of pseudo differential operators.

Narasimhan and Seshadri wrote a seminal paper on stable vector bundles, work which has been recognised as one of the most influential articles in the area. M. S. Raghunathan started research at TIFR on algebraic and discrete groups, and was recognised for his work on rigidity.

===School of Natural Sciences===
The School of Natural Sciences is further split into seven departments working in several areas of physics, chemistry and biology.

Within physics, the Department of Theoretical Physics (DTP) was set up by Bhabha, who conducted research in high energy physics and Condensed Matter Physics. The department worked on the major advances in this period such as Quantum Field Theory, string theory, and superconductivity. The current faculty includes Sandip Trivedi, Shiraz Minwalla, Abhijit Gadde, and Gautam Mandal. Several early faculty members at the institution were renowned in their fields. These include Ashoke Sen, who conducted seminal work on String Theory, specifically S-Duality, while at this institution. Other distinguished members were Spenta Wadia, Sunil Mukhi, Deepak Dhar and Nandini Trivedi.

The Department of Astrophysics works in areas like stellar binaries, gravitational waves and cosmology. TIFR is involved in building India&#x27;s first gravity wave detector. 
The High Energy Physics Department, TIFR has been involved in major accelerator projects like the KEK, Tevatron, LEP and the LHC. TIFR also runs the Pelletron particle accelerator facility. Bhabha&#x27;s motivation resulted in the development of an NMR spectrometer for solid state studies. 
The Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Material Sciences also conducts experimental research in high-temperature superconductivity, nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.

===School of Technology and Computer Science===
The School of Technology and Computer Science grew out of early activities carried out at TIFR for building digital computers. Today, its activities cover areas such as Algorithms, Complexity Theory, Formal Method, Applied Probability, Learning Theory, Mathematical Finance, Information Theory, Communications, etc.

===Department of Biological Sciences===
The Department Of Biological Sciences was set up by Obaid Siddiqi in early 1960s as a molecular biology group. Over the years has expanded to encompass various other branches of modern biology. The department has fourteen labs covering various aspects of modern molecular and cell biology.

<text>Olga Isabel Viscal Garriga (May 5, 1929 – June 1, 1995) was a public orator and political activist. Born in Brooklyn, New York, she moved to Puerto Rico, where she was a student leader and spokesperson of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party&#x27;s branch in Rio Piedras. As an advocate for Puerto Rican independence, she was sentenced to eight years in a U.S. federal penitentiary, for refusing to recognize the sovereign authority of the United States over Puerto Rico.

==Early years==
Olga Isabel Viscal Garriga was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1929. Her parents, Francisco Viscal Bravo and Laura Garriga Gonzalez, had moved there from Puerto Rico in the early 1920s. Olga was one of seven children born to the couple. The children were the fourth-great-grandchildren of Field Marshal Don Juan Andres Daban y Busterino, who served as the Spanish-appointed Governor and General Captain of Puerto Rico from 1783 to 1789. Her parents returned with the family to Puerto Rico, settling in Rio Piedras. Viscal was raised and educated there, after having witnessed discrimination against Puerto Ricans in New York. As she grew up, she strongly disagreed with U.S. policies that limited human rights, freedom of speech, and self-determination in Puerto Rico.

==Student activist==
Viscal enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico, where she earned her Doctoral Degree in Political Sciences. During the late 1940s, and while finishing her Ph.D., she became a student leader and spokesperson of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party&#x27;s branch in Rio Piedras. The Party was headed by Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos, and favored the forceful expulsion of the U.S. from Puerto Rico.
On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements in the archipelago. The Senate, controlled by the &quot;Partido Popular Democrático&quot; (PPD) and presided by Luis Muñoz Marín, approved the bill that day. This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the &quot;Ley de la Mordaza&quot; (Gag Law) when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jesús T. Piñero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948.

Under this new law it would be a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both.

Viscal, who befriended Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos, was a talented orator and political activist. Although she was not directly involved in any violent act in 1950, Viscal was arrested because she participated in a demonstration that turned deadly in Old San Juan, after the police and other authorities opened fire on the demonstrators, one of whom was killed. She was detained on November 2, along with Carmen María Pérez Roque and Ruth Mary Reynolds (The American/Puerto Rican Nationalist) and held in the &quot;La Princesa&quot; jail. During her trial in the federal court in Old San Juan, she was uncooperative with the U.S. government prosecution and refused to recognize the authority of the U.S. over Puerto Rico. She was sentenced to eight years in prison for contempt of court, and released after serving five.

==Later years==
After her release from prison, Viscal went to Cuba, where she was the Puerto Rican representative to the Cuban Parliament. As such, she met with Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. She was a devout Catholic, and thus became disillusioned with Castro&#x27;s politics and selectively atheist policies. After publicly criticizing Castro, she escaped from Cuba with the help of her younger sister, Irma. Olga Viscal Garriga died in June 1995 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. She was the mother of three children, Pedro, Olga and Maria Luz.

==Legacy==
Viscal Garriga was the inspiration for the main character &quot;Antígona,&quot; in the play &quot;La Pasión Según Antígona Pérez&quot; (The Passion According to Antígona Pérez), written by Puerto Rican playwright Luis Rafael Sánchez.

There is a plaque, located at the monument to the Jayuya Uprising participants in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, honoring the women of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Viscal Garriga&#x27;s name is on the fifteenth line of the third plate.

<text>Vilhjálmur Einarsson (5 June 1934 – 28 December 2019) was an Icelandic track and field athlete, and triple-jump silver medalist at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. Vilhjálmur grew up in the East-Icelandic fishing village of Reyðarfjörður and was the son of Einar Stefánsson and Sigríður Vilhjálmsdóttir.

In 1956 Vilhjálmur set a new Olympic Record by jumping 16.26 m in the triple jump, only to be surpassed by Brazil&#x27;s Adhemar da Silva in the same competition. This was the most unexpected result of the Olympics that year, and his silver medal was Iceland&#x27;s first ever Olympic medal. In 1958 he took bronze in the triple jump at the European Athletics Championships in Stockholm, Sweden, with 16.00 m. His personal best was 16.70 m set in 1960 in Laugardalsvöllur, Iceland. He was named Icelandic Sportsperson of the Year five times, more times than anyone else.

Vilhjálmur was also a headmaster of three schools: Héraðsskólinn in Laugarvatn, Reykholtsskóli in Reykholt, and Menntaskólinn in Egilsstaðir, where he later worked as a part-time mathematics teacher. He also was a painter, specializing in landscape painting, and his work has been on display in several art galleries in Iceland.

He attended Dartmouth College. His son Einar Vilhjálmsson later represented Iceland in the men&#x27;s javelin throw at the Summer Olympics (1984, 1988 and 1992).

<doc id="1250657" wikidata="Q4740840" url="?curid=1250657" title="Amazon Bookstore Cooperative">
<text>Amazon Bookstore Cooperative was a feminist bookstore located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that operated from 1970 to 2012. It was the only lesbian/feminist bookstore in the U.S.at some point, but certainly not at its beginning. The shop was named after the Amazons, a mythological tribe of fierce and independent women. In 1994 Amazon.com was founded and within a year, problems started for Amazon Bookstore. Terms of a lawsuit by Amazon bookstore resulted in a small settlement, and a requirement that Amazon Bookstore go by the name &#x27;Amazon Bookstore Collective&#x27; to reduce confusion with Amazon.com.

==Early years==
In 1970 when Amazon was founded by Rosina Richter Christy and Julie Morse Quist, it was far from a full-fledged bookstore. The books were kept in the front room of the collective they lived in and books were only available from 3 to 6 PM or by special arrangement. This arrangement lasted for about two years before the book store moved to Minneapolis&#x27; Lesbian Resource Center and then migrated through a series of different storefront addresses. Working conditions were sometimes difficult and included an unsafe neighborhood and a building with no heat where pipes froze and people had to wear gloves inside the store.

==Lawsuit==
In 1999, the cooperative sued Amazon.com for trademark infringement. After sometimes acrimonious legal proceedings, the case was settled in November of that year, with Amazon Bookstore assigning its common law rights in the Amazon name to Amazon.com; and Amazon.com giving a license back to Amazon Bookstore Cooperative for use of the Amazon name.

==True Colors==

The business announced that they were closing down at the end of June 2008, and buyers came forth to carry on the store as an independent bookstore. Ruta Skujins, with the help of her partner, Joann Bell, decided to take over the store. Transfer of the ownership of the store happened at the end of June, according to an e-mail sent by the store to customers on June 17.

In November 2008 it was announced that the store changed ownership and as a result, the Amazon name could not be used by the new owner as it was owned by Amazon.com. The new owner of the bookstore, Ruta Skujins, changed the name of the store to True Colors Bookstore, and both names were in use during the transition period. The bookstore began experiencing financial difficulties in late 2011, with the store closing in February 2012 due to this.

==Influence and significance==
Amazon became &quot;the oldest independent feminist bookstore in North America&quot; and was probably &quot;the oldest in the English speaking world&quot;. It had an impact that extended both beyond its immediate area and beyond the United States.

It also had a presence in popular culture. Cartoonist and graphic novelist Alison Bechdel was inspired to create the fictional Madwimmin Books in &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; based on experiences at the store.

<doc id="1250659" wikidata="Q3115187" url="?curid=1250659" title="Sweet Caroline">
<text>&quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; is a song written and performed by American singer Neil Diamond and released in May 1969 as a single with the title &quot;Sweet Caroline (Good Times Never Seemed So Good)&quot;. It was arranged by Charles Calello, and recorded at American Sound Studio in Memphis, Tennessee.

==Inspiration==
Neil Diamond has provided different explanations for the song&#x27;s origins. In a 2007 interview, he stated the inspiration for the song was John F. Kennedy&#x27;s daughter, Caroline Kennedy, who was 11 years old at the time it was released. Diamond sang the song for her at her 50th birthday celebration in 2007. On December 21, 2011, in an interview on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Early Show&quot;, Diamond said that a magazine cover photo of Caroline Kennedy as a young child on a horse with her parents John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy created an image in his mind, and the rest of the song came together about five years after seeing the picture. However, in 2014, Diamond said the song was about his then-wife Marcia Murphey, but he needed a three-syllable name to fit the melody.

==Performance==

The song reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the week ending August 16, 1969, and was certified gold by the RIAA on August 18, 1969, for sales of one million singles. &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; was also the first of Diamond&#x27;s 58 entries on the US Easy Listening chart, peaking at No. 3.

In the autumn of 1969, Diamond performed &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; on several television shows. It later reached No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart in March 1971.

In July 2021, &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; re-entered the UK Singles Chart again 50 years after its first UK release, following its use by England supporters during Euro 2020. It re-entered the chart at No. 48 on the week ending July 15 and a week later it rose to No. 20.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; called the song &quot;sensational&quot;, highlighting the fact that Diamond&#x27;s &quot;material and production sound take on a completely different dimension in this love ballad which maintains a warm glow throughout with occasional surges of strength&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;Neil Diamond stirs rich excitement with this voluptuous new &#x27;Sweet Caroline&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; called it a &quot;hard hitting love ballad&quot; with &quot;exceptional production and vocal workout&quot;. The song has proven to be enduringly popular and, as of November 2014, has sold over two million digital downloads in the United States.

==Alternative versions==
There are three distinct mixes of this song. In the original mono 45 mix, the orchestra and glockenspiel are more prominent than in the stereo version on the &quot;Brother Love&#x27;s Travelling Salvation Show&quot; LP. The third version was a remix found only on the initial CD release of Diamond&#x27;s 1974 compilation &quot;His 12 Greatest Hits&quot;. This version has the orchestra mixed down and has the background vocals mixed up. It has a longer fade as well. A live version of the song is on his 1972 &quot;Hot August Night&quot; LP.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Diamond changed some of the lyrics to &quot;Hands ... washing hands ... don&#x27;t touch me ... I won&#x27;t touch you.&quot;

==Use at sporting events==
===United States===
The National Football League&#x27;s Carolina Panthers have played the song as a victory song at all home games since 1996. In 2020, the Panthers played the song to an empty Bank of America Stadium in honor of all front-line workers in the COVID-19 pandemic.

The song has been played at Fenway Park, home of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Boston Red Sox, since at least 1997 and in the middle of the eighth inning at every game since 2002. On opening night of the 2010 season at Fenway Park, the song was performed live by Diamond himself. Several days after the Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013, Neil Diamond led the crowd at Fenway Park in a rendition of the song. The New York Yankees, the longtime rivals, showed their support for the city by playing the song over Yankee Stadium&#x27;s loudspeakers the day after the incident. Sales of the song surged nearly 600 percent in the week after the bombings, to 19,000 copies, up from 2,800 the week before. Diamond said that he would donate his royalties from those sales to the One Fund Boston charity to help the people affected by the bombings.

The Iowa State Cyclones have used &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; as a football victory song since 2006.

Since 2008, the University of Pittsburgh has used &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; as an unofficial school sing-along song by inserting &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Pitt!&quot; over the instrumental three-beat &quot;Ba Ba Ba&quot; interval after the title refrain and replacing the repeated phrase (often added by fans, although not in the original recording) &quot;So good&quot; with &quot;Go Pitt!&quot; The song started as a rallying anthem played between the third and fourth quarters of Pittsburgh Panthers football games, but has been adopted for use during other university sports contests, alumni events, and student ceremonies, including graduation commencement ceremonies, and references to the song have appeared on various school merchandise. However, Pitt&#x27;s arch-rival, West Virginia University, &quot;adapts&quot; the song for their own purposes to troll Pitt, even when Pitt is not the opponent.

&quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; is sometimes part of the regular rotation of songs during sports events at other universities, including the University of North Carolina.
Out of a speculated concern with the song&#x27;s lyrics in the wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, the university removed the song from the rotation of music played at football games prior to the 2012 season. However, performances resumed to loud renditions at Penn State football games in September 2013.

On February 22, 2020, newly crowned WBC and &quot;The Ring&quot; heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury sang the song live in the ring at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas to celebrate his knockout victory against Deontay Wilder following the conclusion of their rematch. Fury had also previously sung &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; at a press conference ahead of his fight against Francesco Pianeta in 2018.

=== Canada ===
The song is used at the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s Erie Otters home games, where fans replace the &quot;bum, bum, bum&quot; with &quot;London sucks!&quot; in reference to the rival London Knights.
The National Hockey League Vancouver Canucks regularly play this song at Rogers Arena, their home rink, during 3rd-period stoppages in play to energize the home crowd.

===United Kingdom===
Fans of the Northern Ireland national football team adopted the song as an anthem after it was played in the post-match stadium celebrations after defeating England in 2005. The song has been used at home games ever since. Northern Irish darts player Daryl Gurney began using the song as his walk-on song in 2015 for Professional Darts Corporation events, in tribute to the football team.

On June 29, 2021, at the Round of 16 of the UEFA Euro 2020 championships, after the England national football team won 2–0 against Germany, England supporters amongst the 40,000 spectators who were present at Wembley Stadium remained and sang the song after the match. The team manager, Gareth Southgate, remarked &quot;So, to be able to send them home feeling as they do tonight, to hear them at the end ... I mean, you can&#x27;t beat a bit of &#x27;Sweet Caroline&#x27;, can you? That&#x27;s a belter, really.&quot; During post-match interviews, the team captain, Harry Kane, was visibly moved as he paused to listen to the singing crowd, remarking: &quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s special. I&#x27;m speechless, I don&#x27;t know what to say.&quot; After their 2–1 semi-final win against Denmark, the England players led the crowd through a rendition of the song.

The song was subsequently adopted by the England women&#x27;s football team on their run to victory in Euro 2022, being played in the stadiums after each game as England won; Chloe Kelly, who scored the winning goal in the final, was being interviewed pitch side after the win but ran off with the microphone when the song started playing to sing along with the team.

Reading started using the song as requested by the players in their first season in the Premiership for the 2006/07 season. According to former player Glenn Little, this was selected as part of a celebration of their record-winning 106-point Championship season. However, it was not until 2015, when Little suggested it should be re-established, that it became a fan favourite. The song was later adopted by supporters of Aston Villa during their Championship game against Stoke City in February 2019, as they battled from an early deficit to obtain a draw. After the game, Aston Villa had 12-game unbeaten run, which enabled them to reach the 2019 English Football League play-offs. Subsequently, they continued to sing the song after they won a pivotal penalty shootout at their cross-city rivals West Bromwich Albion, before eventually winning the play-offs and winning promotion to the Premier League for the 2019–20 season. The club players had later continued their strong association with the song, and sang the song within their dressing room, after a pivotal draw at their final match of the season, to narrowly escape relegation from the Premier League by only one point.

For cricket in England, the home crowd at Lord&#x27;s, along with the players of the England cricket team, sang the song after their boundary count win at the Final of the 2019 Cricket World Cup.

The song was played in Arthur Ashe Stadium after British tennis player Emma Raducanu won the 2021 US Open Women&#x27;s singles final.

On November 15, 2021, the Swiss national football team sang the song after a 4–0 win against Bulgaria in honor to the Northern Ireland national football team, who drew against the Italy national football team, thus permitting the Swiss to qualify directly to the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

The song is also played before the main event of Matchroom Sports boxing cards in the UK and sometimes overseas.

===Mexico===
The song is also played at the Algodoneros de Unión Laguna stadium whenever the team wins a match, considered as a victory song for the locals. Remixes of the song are also played there on important events, accompanied by fireworks.

===Mixed martial arts===
UFC middleweight fighter Darren Till has adopted the song as his entrance music beginning at UFC Fight Night: Thompson vs. Till.

==Legacy==
In 2019, &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2020 the song by Neil Diamond was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==DJ Ötzi version==
Austrian singer DJ Ötzi released a version of the song in 2009 through UMG. His version reached number 19 on the German singles chart, staying for 18 weeks in the German charts. It also peaked at number 18 on the Austrian charts. The song was also included on his album &quot;Hotel Engel (Gold Edition)&quot;.

<doc id="1250664" wikidata="Q5250402" url="?curid=1250664" title="Deep inference">
<text>In mathematical logic, deep inference names a general idea in structural proof theory that breaks with the classical sequent calculus by generalising the notion of structure to permit inference to occur in contexts of high structural complexity. The term &quot;deep inference&quot; is generally reserved for proof calculi where the structural complexity is unbounded; in this article we will use non-shallow inference to refer to calculi that have structural complexity greater than the sequent calculus, but not unboundedly so, although this is not at present established terminology.

Deep inference is not important in logic outside of structural proof theory, since the phenomena that lead to the proposal of formal systems with deep inference are all related to the cut-elimination theorem. The first calculus of deep inference was proposed by Kurt Schütte, but the idea did not generate much interest at the time.

Nuel Belnap proposed display logic in an attempt to characterise the essence of structural proof theory. The calculus of structures was proposed in order to give a cut-free characterisation of noncommutative logic. Cirquent calculus was developed as a system of deep inference allowing to explicitly account for the possibility of subcomponent-sharing.

<text>In mathematical logic, a proof calculus or a proof system is built to prove statements.

==Overview==
A proof system includes the components:
* Formal language: The set &quot;L&quot; of formulas admitted by the system, for example, propositional logic or first-order logic.
* Rules of inference: List of rules that can be employed to prove theorems from axioms and theorems.
* Axioms: Formulas in &quot;L&quot; assumed to be valid. All theorems are derived from axioms.

A formal proof of a well-formed formula in a proof system is a set of axioms and rules of inference of proof system that infers that the well-formed formula is a theorem of proof system.

Usually a given proof calculus encompasses more than a single particular formal system, since many proof calculi are under-determined and can be used for radically different logics. For example, a paradigmatic case is the sequent calculus, which can be used to express the consequence relations of both intuitionistic logic and relevance logic. Thus, loosely speaking, a proof calculus is a template or design pattern, characterized by a certain style of formal inference, that may be specialized to produce specific formal systems, namely by specifying the actual inference rules for such a system. There is no consensus among logicians on how best to define the term.

==Examples of proof calculi==
The most widely known proof calculi are those classical calculi that are still in widespread use:
*The class of Hilbert systems, of which the most famous example is the 1928 Hilbert–Ackermann system of first-order logic;
*Gerhard Gentzen&#x27;s calculus of natural deduction, which is the first formalism of structural proof theory, and which is the cornerstone of the formulae-as-types correspondence relating logic to functional programming;
*Gentzen&#x27;s sequent calculus, which is the most studied formalism of structural proof theory.

Many other proof calculi were, or might have been, seminal, but are not widely used today.

*Aristotle&#x27;s syllogistic calculus, presented in the &quot;Organon&quot;, readily admits formalisation. There is still some modern interest in syllogisms, carried out under the aegis of term logic.
*Gottlob Frege&#x27;s two-dimensional notation of the &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; (1879) is usually regarded as introducing the modern concept of quantifier to logic.
*C.S. Peirce&#x27;s existential graph easily might have been seminal, had history worked out differently.

Modern research in logic teems with rival proof calculi:
*Several systems have been proposed that replace the usual textual syntax with some graphical syntax. proof nets and cirquent calculus are among such systems.
*Recently, many logicians interested in structural proof theory have proposed calculi with deep inference, for instance display logic, hypersequents, the calculus of structures, and bunched implication.

<doc id="1250676" wikidata="Q3520135" url="?curid=1250676" title="Deemed university">
<text>In India, a deemed university or deemed-to-be-university is an accreditation granted to higher educational institutions in India by the Ministry of Education. According to the ministry&#x27;s definition, the accreditation indicates, &quot;an Institution of higher education, other than universities, working at a very high standard in specific area of study&quot; and the accreditation grants &quot;the academic status and privileges of a university&quot;.

==Deemed university status==
The higher education system in India includes both private and public universities. Public universities are supported by the Government of India and the state governments, while private universities are mostly supported by various bodies and societies. Universities in India are recognized by the University Grants Commission, which draws its power from the &quot;University Grants Commission Act, 1956&quot;. In addition to this, 15 Professional Councils are established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and coordination. The status of a deemed to be university allows full autonomy in courses, syllabus, admissions and fees. , the UGC lists 137 institutes which were granted the deemed to be university status. According to this list, the first institute to be granted deemed university status was Indian Institute of Science which was granted this status on 12 May 1958. The state with the most deemed universities is Tamil Nadu with 28 universities having deemed status.

Section 12 (B) of the UGC Act of 1956 also grants the UGC the right to &quot;allocate and disburse, out of the Fund of the Commission, grants to Universities...&quot; As such, the UGC categorizes institutes as either &quot;declared fit to receive Central/UGC assistance under Section 12 (B) of the UGC Act–1956&quot;, or not, and notes this status at the lists published. Updates to these declarations are done in meetings of the UGC and published in the minutes. The latest list, , lists 50 institutes as fit to receive Central/UGC assistance.

==Other types==
Other types of universities under the regulatory purview of the UGC include:
* Central universities, or Union universities are established by Act of Parliament and are under the purview of the Department of Higher Education.
* State universities are run by the state government of each of the states and territories of India, and are usually established by a state legislative assembly act.
* Institute under State Legislature Act is an Institution established or incorporated by a State Legislature Act, in India. Institutes that are &#x27;under State Legislature Act&#x27; enjoy academic status and privileges of state universities.
* State private universities are established under the State Act approved by the UGC. They can grant degrees but they are not allowed to have off-campus affiliated colleges.

<doc id="1250682" wikidata="Q7842639" url="?curid=1250682" title="Trinity Christian College">
<text>Trinity Christian College is a private Christian college in Palos Heights, Illinois. It was founded in 1959 by a group of Chicago businessmen who wanted to establish a college providing students with a Christian higher education in a Reformed tradition as a college in Illinois. The college offers degrees in more than 70 programs of study. In 2023-2024 they reduced the employees by 10 percent. 

== Campus ==
The Martin and Janet Ozinga Chapel, a 1200-seat facility, provides practice and rehearsal rooms for the music department, and houses the campus ministries program under the direction of the campus chaplain. The Grand Lobby has hosted a variety of events beneath its stained glass window, the first of a series of stained glass panels hung throughout the building designed to celebrate Trinity Christian&#x27;s mission in Reformed higher education.

The Heritage Science Center comprises 38,000-square feet (3,500 m2) of classroom and lab space for chemistry, biology, and physics programs, as well as classrooms and a lecture hall for technology and computer science studies.

The Art and Communication Center (ARCC), provides Trinity Christian students with art and design studios, a graphic design lab, student gallery, The Marg Kallemeyn (black box) Theatre for the performing arts, and the Seerveld Gallery that welcomes guest artists and student artists.

New athletics fields and a new athletics complex have been in development with completion of the DeVos Athletics and Recreation Center in the autumn of 2013. The facility features a state of the art lab for exercise students, a bouldering wall, and a fitness center.

== Academics ==
Trinity Christian College claims a cohesive approach to its core curriculum of philosophy, history, English, and theology. The traditional (not including adult learners) student body has grown to more than 1000 undergraduates taught by more than 80 instructors. Although students are drawn from predominantly Reformed and Presbyterian church backgrounds, students also come from other Christian traditions such as Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic.

In Fall 2012, Trinity began its first two master&#x27;s degree programs, in counseling psychology and special education. Although they added several more education masters, they have discontinued them all and no longer offer masters degrees in education. The school also began a three-year speech and language pathology program, in which students take classes at Trinity for three years majoring in communication disorders. Then for two years students can attend either Saint Xavier University in Chicago, Illinois or Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Michigan to finish their bachelor&#x27;s degree from Trinity and receive a master&#x27;s degree in speech language pathology.

=== Accreditation and memberships ===
Trinity Christian College is a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU) and the Council for Independent Colleges (CIC). The college is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission.

===Adult undergraduate programs===
In 1998 Trinity Christian College opened the TRACS department, now called Adult Undergraduate Programs, to serve the needs of the non-traditional student. Adults 23 years of age and older can complete their college degree through this program.

The Adult Undergraduate Programs are offered in a cohort format, so students begin the program as part of a group (20 maximum) and move through each course together. The cohort format encourages friendships and creates a supportive environment. Each course in the Adult Programs is accelerated. Courses that would normally require 16 weeks to finish are completed in five-, six- or seven-week periods. Classes cover the necessary course material in a shorter time frame, helping students finish their degrees and/or teaching license in less than two years. Courses are held on the same night of the week during the same time period (usually 6 p.m.–10 p.m.) throughout the program.

===Graduate studies===
In 2012 Trinity Christian College began offering two graduate level programs: a Master of Arts in Special Education and a Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology.

The Graduate Studies Special Education program is for those who have already completed an undergraduate degree and have a valid teaching license. Students attend class just one night a week, on the same evenings throughout the entire program, for 1 ½ years. Some courses are blended with online instruction. The program is offered at the main campus in Palos Heights, Illinois. This program no longer exists.

== Athletics ==
The Trinity Christian athletic teams are called the Trolls. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference (CCAC) since the 1987–1988 academic year. The teams are also a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA), primarily competing as an independent in the North Central Region of the Division I level.
Trinity Christian competes in 14 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, track &amp; field and volleyball. Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track &amp; field and volleyball.

===Soccer===
The women&#x27;s soccer team collected Trinity&#x27;s first national title by winning the NCCAA National Soccer Tournament in 2005, and returned to the NCCAA national finals in 2007.

<text>Susquehanna University is a private liberal arts college in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States. Its name is derived from the original Susquehannock settlers of the region. Founded in 1858 as a missionary institute, it became a four-year liberal arts college in 1895. It is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Susquehanna is classified among &quot;Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts &amp; Sciences Focus&quot;, though it also has a business school, master&#x27;s degrees in education and joint-degree programs in engineering and for a Master of Business Administration. It also offers the only bachelor&#x27;s degree in luxury brand marketing and management in the U.S. 

The academic programs are within the four schools of the Arts, Humanities, Natural and Social Sciences, and the AACSB International-accredited Sigmund Weis School of Business. Susquehanna University enrolls more than 2,200 undergraduate students from 33 states and 23 countries, and maintains a student-to-faculty ratio of 13 to 1. Most students are required to live on campus all four years and as of 2012, all students participate in a cross-cultural study away or service-learning experience known as the GO Program.

==History==

===Founding and early years===

The institution was founded by Benjamin Kurtz, its first president. Having already assisted in the founding of Gettysburg Seminary, Kurtz wanted to create another institution to expand the form of American Lutheranism that he advocated.

Kurtz&#x27;s mission was to &quot;educate men for the gospel ministry ... who cannot take a full course of training adapted to their age and circumstances; a course so thorough in theology as will qualify them to be able and faithful ministers of Christ.&quot; The American Lutherans of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, provided 50 students, pledged $22,000, and offered the provisional use of its church facilities. However, they stipulated that the institute be expanded to a junior college and that a sister college for women also be formed.
On September 1, 1858, the Missionary Institute of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and Susquehanna Female College were established and legally recognized 23 days later. It had two departments: the theology department and the classical department. In 1873, the sister college disbanded and the institute became co-educational. 

The institute officially became known as Susquehanna University in 1895.

===20th century===

The 20th century brought many changes. The institution had recently begun offering bachelor degrees and changed its name to reflect that. In 1903, the board approved Susquehanna’s colors, orange and maroon.

By the 1920s, student enrollment skyrocketed, accommodations were refurbished and the campus expanded, and academic departments and offerings were enhanced.

==Academics==

Susquehanna University is a private, non-profit liberal arts college in central Pennsylvania devoted primarily to undergraduate education. It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Susquehanna has a student-to-faculty ratio of 13:1 with 90% of full-time faculty holding a doctorate or highest equivalent degree.

The institution offers more than 100 majors, minors and programs and allows students to design their own major, complete a double degree, or start undeclared. Susquehanna offers pre-professional programs in pre-law, pre-veterinary medicine and teaching, and coordinates with Thomas Jefferson University for allied health, Temple University for dentistry and Case Western Reserve University, Columbia University, and Washington University in St. Louis for 3+2 dual-degree engineering programs. It has articulation agreements with the University of Nicosia in Cyprus that offers an accelerated path to earn a Master of Business Administration degree and with Capital University Law School to pursue a Doctorate of Law. In 2016, an average of 96% of graduates were enrolled in graduate school or employed within six months of graduation.

===Organization and administration===

Susquehanna University consists of four schools: School of the Arts, School of Humanities, School of Natural and Social Sciences, and the Sigmund Weis School of Business. 

Susquehanna University is governed by the president, a governing board of trustees, and a team of administrators.

===Rankings===

===Study abroad===

The GO Program, as part of a school policy adopted in 2009, requires all Susquehanna students go off-campus for cross-cultural learning. Students have a choice between GO Short programs of 2–3 weeks or semester-long GO Long programs. In 2013, the GO Program was awarded the Andrew Heiskell Award for Innovation in International Education

==Campus==

The Susquehanna University campus spans in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. There are more than 50 buildings on campus, primarily in the style of Georgian architecture. The campus has four buildings that are Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-certified (LEED) by the U.S. Green Building Council: two residence halls, the Natural Sciences Center, and the Admission House. 

Kurtz Lane, named after the founding president, is a pedestrian way that runs through the center of campus. A portion of the lower lane is lined with ginkgo trees.
Students are guaranteed housing all four years, and nearly all students live on campus. Students can choose from traditional corridor-style halls, suites, townhouses, apartments, and family-style houses, each requiring no more than a 10-minute walk to class.

===Selinsgrove and Seibert halls===
Selinsgrove Hall is a -story brick structure constructed in 1858 in the Italianate style. The roof features a wooden cupola and the structure was previously featured on the institution&#x27;s logo. Seibert Hall is a -story brick structure constructed in 1902 in a restrained Colonial Revival style. Both Selinsgrove Hall and Seibert Hall, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

===Admission House===
In 2017, the institution dedicated a $7 million space to welcome prospective students and families. According to the Susquehanna&#x27;s website, Admission House was funded through contributions from the board of trustees. Unlike most other buildings on campus, the Admission House has a white facade instead of a naturally red-brick exterior. The building was designed by architect Peter Bohlin of Bohlin Cywinski Jackson as a modern take on a barn to pay tribute to central Pennsylvania’s agricultural tradition, even though the institution does not offer an agriculture academic program. 

===Apfelbaum Hall===

Apfelbaum Hall was built in 1999 and houses the Sigmund Weis School of Business and the communications department.
===Natural Sciences Center===
The Natural Sciences Center is a $32-million academic building that houses Susquehanna’s biology, chemistry, earth and environmental science, neuroscience, ecology, health care studies, and pre-professional programs. It received Silver LEED certification. The building was dedicated in 2010.

===Solar array===
In 2018, Susquehanna University completed a solar array with WGL Energy to supply 30 percent of the institution&#x27;s electricity. At the time, it was the largest college- or university-sponsored solar array in Pennsylvania, and one of the largest solar projects in the Commonwealth. The 12,000-panel array is estimated to produce over 5,300 megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity per year.

== Student life ==
Susquehanna University offers more than 150 student clubs and organizations, a variety of honor societies and professional organizations, and 11 Greek Life organizations.

===Traditions===
First-Year Students&#x27; Move In Day welcomes first-year students by sending orientation team members out to carry all new students&#x27; belongings into their dorm rooms. Many faculty and staff will also assist with the move-in process.

Thanksgiving Dinner is held prior to students leaving for Thanksgiving vacation. Students are served a turkey dinner by faculty, staff, and the president.

Christmas Candlelight Service is one of Susquehanna&#x27;s most cherished traditions. Held in Weber Auditorium in early December, the service includes songs, readings, and prayers and finishes with everyone in attendance holding a lit candle.

&#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas sees students come to the campus center dressed in their pajamas and indulge in cookies and cocoa while enjoying a reading of the classic Christmas tale.

<text>Walter Stanborough Sutton (April 5, 1877 – November 10, 1916) was an American geneticist and biologist whose most significant contribution to present-day biology was his theory that the Mendelian laws of inheritance could be applied to chromosomes at the cellular level of living organisms. This is now known as the Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory.

==Early life==
Sutton was born in Utica, New York, and was raised on a farm as the fifth of seven sons to Judge William B. Sutton and his wife, Agnes Black Sutton, in Russell, Kansas. On the farm, he developed a mechanical aptitude by maintaining and repairing farm equipment, an aptitude that proved helpful later as he worked on oil drilling rigs and with medical instrumentation.

==University of Kansas==
After graduating high school in Russell, he enrolled at the University of Kansas in engineering in 1896. Following the death of his younger brother (John) from typhus in 1897, Sutton switched his major to biology with an interest in medicine. While at the University of Kansas, both he and his older brother, William Sutton, played basketball for Dr. James Naismith. Sutton distinguished himself as a student by being elected to both Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi and receiving both bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees by 1901. For his Masters thesis, he studied the spermatogenesis of &quot;Brachystola magna&quot;, a large grasshopper indigenous to the farmlands upon which Sutton was raised.

==Columbia University==
Considering the advice of his mentor at KU, Dr. C. E. McClung, Sutton moved to Columbia University for further study of zoology under Dr. Edmund B. Wilson. It was here that Sutton wrote his two significant works in genetics – &quot;On the morphology of the chromosome group in Brachystola magna&quot; and &quot;The chromosomes in heredity&quot;. Effectively, Sutton could now explain &quot;why the yellow dog is yellow&quot;.

The German biologist Theodor Boveri independently reached the same conclusions as Sutton, and their concepts are often referred to as the Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory. Sutton&#x27;s hypothesis was widely accepted by most scientists, particularly cytologists, at the time. The continued work of Thomas Hunt Morgan at Columbia brought the theory to universal acceptance by 1915 through his studies of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, the fruit fly, even as William Bateson continued to question the theory until 1921.

Sutton did not complete his PhD in Zoology as he originally planned. At the age of 26, he returned to the Kansas oil fields for 2 years. There he was able to perfect a device to start large gas engines with high pressure-gas and develop hoisting apparatuses for deep wells. Sutton&#x27;s mechanical aptitudes never left him. His father finally directed him to return to his medical studies and he did so returning to Columbia University in 1905.

Sutton&#x27;s medical studies proceeded through the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. While he continued to work on patents associated with oil drilling, Sutton also began at this stage to apply his mechanical aptitude to improving medical instruments. With credit for his graduate studies at both the University of Kansas and Columbia University, Sutton obtained his doctorate in medicine in 1907 graduating with &quot;high standing&quot;. He then began an internship at Roosevelt Hospital in New York working in the surgical division headed by Dr. Joseph Blake.

==Career==
In addition to his clinic duties at Roosevelt Hospital, Sutton was also able to work with the Surgical Research Laboratory at the College of Physicians and Surgeons. With that support, he was able to begin developing and improving a variety of medical and surgical practices including improving anesthetic techniques, and perfecting abdominal irrigation.

In 1909, Sutton returned to Kansas City, Kansas where his family had relocated and his father and brother were in law practice. Sutton was appointed assistant professor of surgery at the four-year-old University of Kansas Medical School. The tenuous nature of the appointment at the young school led him to also maintain a private practice and serve on the staff of St. Margaret&#x27;s Hospital as well as the university&#x27;s Bell Memorial Hospital. For six years, Sutton performed a wide range of surgeries carefully documenting the procedures. He published several articles related to these cases going back to his internship at Roosevelt.

In 1911, he had accepted a commission as a First Lieutenant in the United States Army Medical reserve Corps. This eventually led to his taking a leave of absence from the university in February 1915 to serve at the American Ambulance Hospital outside Paris. Sutton and others from his days at Columbia and Roosevelt arrived at College of Juilly on February 23 where hospital facilities had been set up only 40 miles from the front lines of World War I. Within 2 months, he was surgeon-in-chief handling administrative duties in addition to his surgical responsibilities. His inventive aptitude was perhaps never more valued as he developed fluoroscopic techniques to identify and localize shrapnel within the soldier&#x27;s bodies and then removed the foreign items with instruments of his own design. After his return, he documented these techniques in Binnie&#x27;s Manual of Operative Surgery. Sutton&#x27;s return sailing from France was on June 26, 1915, having stayed only four months, but have made a significant contribution to wartime medical treatment.

Dr. Sutton died rather unexpectedly at the age of 39 due to complications from acute appendicitis.

<text>The traditional Welsh poetic meters consist of 24 types of poetic meter, called Y Pedwar Mesur ar Hugain in Welsh. They are all written in cynghanedd of varying degrees of complexity.

Although called &quot;traditional,&quot; they were compiled – and later redefined at least once – in the Late Middle Ages and omit some of the older forms such as the &quot;englyn milwr&quot;. Only a few of them were widely used by the professional poets (&quot;Beirdd yr Uchelwyr&quot;), and the use of some of the more complicated ones is confined to occasional poems of technical virtuosity dating to the end of the Middle Ages.

The twenty four traditional Welsh poetic meters are:
*Awdl-gywydd
*Byr-a-thoddaid
*Cadwynfyr
*Clogyrnach
*Cyhydedd Fer
*Cyhydedd Hir
*Cyhydedd Naw Ban
*Cyrch-a-chwta
*Cywydd Deuair Fyrion
*Cywydd Deuair Hirion: see Cywydd
*Cywydd Llosgyrnog
*Englyn Proest Cyfnewidiog
*Englyn Proest Cadwynog
*Englyn Unodl Crwca
*Englyn Unodl Union
*Gorchest Beirdd
*Gwawdodyn Byr
*Gwawdodyn Hir
*Hir-a-thoddaid
*Rhupunt Byr
*Rhupunt Hir
*Rhupunt Hwyaf
*Tawddgyrch Cadwynog
*Toddaid

<text>The Gila trout (Oncorhynchus gilae) is a species of salmonid, related to the rainbow trout, native to the Southwest United States. Prior to 2006 the Gila trout was federally listed as endangered. In July 2006, after much work by the Game and Fish departments in New Mexico and Arizona, the US Forest Service and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Gila trout was down-listed to threatened, with a special provision called a &quot;4d rule&quot; that will allow limited sport fishing – for the first time in nearly half a century. By the time the Gila trout was closed to fishing in the 1950s, its numbers and range were so depleted and so reduced this copper-colored trout simply wasn&#x27;t very accessible to anglers. As of 2011 there is fishing in both states for this fish.

==Range==
The Gila trout is native to tributaries of the Gila River in Arizona and New Mexico. The Gila trout is found historically in the Verde and Agua Fria drainages in Arizona. A note in the archives of Aldo Leopold, dated 1923, contains anecdotal evidence of a native trout in Tonto Creek, AZ. Gila trout have persisted in five streams within the Gila National Forest, New Mexico, including: Iron, McKenna, and Spruce creeks in the Gila Wilderness Area, along with Main and South Diamond creeks in the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Area.

==Description==
Gila trout have a yellow body, with black spots. The average total length is about ; with maximum total length approximately . Gila trout are closely related to Apache trout. However, Apache trout can have a spot behind and in front of the pupil (eye) and big noticeable spots on the body whereas Gila trout are characterized by numerous small dark spots on the upper half of the body.

==Biology==
Gila trout can be found in small mountain water streams, and in confined pools. They are opportunistic feeders that feed on aquatic insects such as trichopterans, ephemeropterans, chironomids, and coleopterans, as well as small fishes.

==Reproduction==
Depending on the water temperature, spawning season occurs in late spring and summer. The number of eggs produced from females held in hatcheries averaged about 150. The maximum fecundity observed was 686 eggs.

==Conservation==
The Gila trout has been threatened by competition and hybridization with introduced game fish such as the rainbow trout. However, the primary cause of reduced Gila trout populations is habitat loss caused by loss of water flow and shade-giving trees, caused in turn by fires, human destruction of riparian vegetation, livestock overgrazing, agricultural irrigation and water diversion, and channelization of streams in the Gila trout&#x27;s native range. By the time the Gila trout was listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1967 its range had reduced from several hundred miles of stream to just 20 in the Gila Wilderness and Aldo Leopold Wilderness. After listing USFWS began an aggressive program of stream restoration, removing the introduced trout, restoring and repairing riparian vegetation (to maintain cooler water temperatures), and restocking restored streams with young Gila trout. The Mora National Fish Hatchery and Technology Center in northern New Mexico keeps brood stocks of the Gila trout and supplies the fish for restocking. The species is now more secure than it was in the 1970s, having been moved to 10 new streams, though populations and habitat are still far below those originally established. Conservationists hope to eventually delist the species and allow fishing, thus forming alliances with fishermen in order to help preserve the species. Major wildfires and drought will always play a major role in the status of any trout species.

<doc id="1250741" wikidata="Q294351" url="?curid=1250741" title="Siniša Mihajlović">
<text>Siniša Mihajlović (, ; 20 February 1969 – 16 December 2022) was a Serbian football manager and professional footballer who played as a defender.

Mihajlović had an illustrious playing career, winning the European Cup with Red Star Belgrade in 1991 before moving to Italy, making 353 appearances for Serie A sides Roma, Sampdoria, Lazio and Inter Milan and winning league titles with the latter two clubs. Considered by many to be among the best free kick takers of all time, he holds the all-time record in Serie A for most goals from free kicks with 28 goals. He won 63 caps and scored 10 goals for Yugoslavia from 1991 to 2003, of which his first four caps in 1991 represented SFR Yugoslavia, and played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000 tournaments.

Mihajlović retired from playing in 2006, becoming assistant manager at Inter. He managed six Serie A clubs from 2008 to 2022, starting and finishing with Bologna and also including Fiorentina, Torino and AC Milan. He was the coach of the Serbia national team from May 2012 to November 2013. He was diagnosed with leukemia in 2019 and died from the disease in 2022.

==Early life==
Born in Vukovar into a working-class family of a Bosnian Serb father and a Croat mother, Mihajlović was raised in Borovo Naselje with a younger brother, Dražen (b. 1973). Their father Bogdan (d. 2011) was a truck driver at the Građevinar construction company in Vukovar, while their mother Viktorija worked in the Borovo shoe factory. Mihajlović identified as a Serb, but said that he viewed Croatia as his country as well.

During the Croatian War of Independence, his home was destroyed by Croatian forces, among whom was his childhood best friend, an ethnic Croat, forcing his parents to flee. His maternal uncle called his mother and said that she should stay in Borovo, and that Siniša&#x27;s father was to be killed. His uncle was arrested when the Serbian Volunteer Guard took over Borovo, but was freed because he was related to Mihajlović. In a 2016 interview Mihajlović said he had forgiven his childhood friend in a meeting in Zagreb prior to the crucial Euro 2000 qualification match between FR Yugoslavia and Croatia.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Mihajlović started playing organized football with his hometown team NK Borovo. He quickly marked himself out as a talented youngster, making the SR Croatia select squad for the Yugoslav inter-republic youth football tournaments.

In 1986, he was attached to NK Borovo&#x27;s first team. Playing in the SR Croatia provincial league (third tier competition on the Yugoslav club football pyramid), his first team debut took place on 25 May 1986 against Šparta in Beli Manastir. The match ended 1–1 with Mihajlović scoring a goal. The 17-year-old also got his first taste of professionalism with his first monthly salary being CHF500.

In late 1986, Red Star Belgrade representatives led by scout Kule Aćimović came to watch the seventeen-year-old in a friendly Borovo played against FK Rad, but decided not to sign him.

Then in late spring 1987, with NK Rijeka and Dinamo Vinkovci both seeking to sign Mihajlović, Dinamo Zagreb—led by club president Ivo Vrhovec and head coach Ćiro Blažević—also expressed an interest; their youth players Zvonimir Boban and Robert Prosinečki had been playing with Mihajlović on the SR Croatia select youth team at inter-republic and provincial youth tournaments and recommended him to the team. After seeing Mihajlović in a training session, Blažević took him with the rest of the first team to Sassari for an impromptu getaway between two league matches towards the end of the season, and gave him a substitute appearance in Dinamo shirt in a friendly against local club Torres Sassari.

In September 1987, Mihajlović was invited to join Dinamo&#x27;s youth squad for a friendly tournament in Salem, West Germany where he performed well. However, no deal was agreed again as the club&#x27;s head coach Ćiro Blažević felt that Dinamo already had players for the central midfield position that were &quot;just as good if not better&quot;, such as incoming Haris Škoro as well as club mainstay Marko Mlinarić and returnee Stjepan Deverić. With Dinamo only prepared to offer a stipend-based agreement rather than a professional contract, Mihajlović decided to continue with NK Borovo.

The decision not to take Dinamo&#x27;s offer cost Mihajlović a place in the Yugoslavia under-20; head coach Mirko Jozić had told him that he would not be called up for the upcoming FIFA World Youth Championship in Chile unless he signed with the Zagreb club.

===Vojvodina===
Mihajlović signed for FK Vojvodina in 1988, as part of a group of players acquired by the club, which included defensive midfielder Slaviša Jokanović, and defenders Budimir Vujačić and Miroslav Tanjga. The club won the Yugoslav league title, with Mihajlović scoring four goals in 31 appearances. The following 1989–90 season saw Vojvodina compete in the European Cup for only the second time in their history, but lost in the first round to Hungarian champions Honvéd.

===Red Star Belgrade===
Mihajlović joined Red Star Belgrade on 10 December 1990 in a high-profile transfer with a transfer fee of DM1 million paid out to Vojvodina. Arriving at a club coached by his old Vojvodina mentor Ljupko Petrović, Mihajlović was brought in to establish a robust presence on the left side of midfield as well as to score set-piece goals. In the European Cup semi-final return leg versus Bayern Munich, Mihajlović scored both Red Star goals—a free-kick opener and the injury time winner with a shot that deflected off Klaus Augenthaler. In the final, Red Star defeated Olympique de Marseille on penalties, after a 0–0 draw at full time, with Mihajlović being one of the shootout scorers.

Mihajlović was also in the team later that year when Red Star Belgrade won the Intercontinental Cup, defeating Colo-Colo 3–0. He was then included by Yugoslavia national football team to UEFA Euro 1992, but the nation was disqualified from the competition by United Nations sanctions due to the Yugoslav Wars.

===Roma===
In the summer of 1992, amid interest from Juventus, Mihajlović signed for Roma for a reported ITL8.5 billion (~US$5.9 million) transfer fee, at the request of head coach Vujadin Boškov, also a new arrival to Olimpico. The club were looking to improve on their previous season&#x27;s 5th place league finish.

Mihajlović secured a regular first team spot in the left midfield, and the team finished 10th in the league. Mihajlović also played a significant part in Roma&#x27;s UEFA Cup campaign where they reached the quarterfinals—losing to Borussia Dortmund in a tie that saw the Serb score a trademark free-kick for a 1–0 first leg lead, before being beaten 2–0 in the return. Due to a long-term injury to Roma&#x27;s left back Amedeo Carboni midway through the season, coach Boškov moved Mihajlović to the left back position.

The 1993–94 season started with new head coach Carlo Mazzone in charge after Boškov was sacked. In addition to the four foreigners already at the club, the club brought in Argentine Abel Balbo thus increasing competition for three foreign spots. Mihajlović continued as a left back under the new manager. In the 1993–94 season, the club finished 7th, and out of Europe for the second season running.

Years later, talking about his playing days, Mihajlović referred to his stay in Roma as &quot;the two worst seasons of my entire career&quot;.

===Sampdoria===
In 1994, Mihajlović joined Sampdoria, who were the third-placed club in previous season&#x27;s Serie A standings and the Coppa Italia winners, coached by Sven-Göran Eriksson. Also arriving the same summer were Inter stalwarts Walter Zenga and Riccardo Ferri as part of the deal that took goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca the other way.

In his four seasons at Sampdoria, Mihajlović saw limited success in the Serie A. In the European competitions, however, he helped Sampdoria reach the 1994–95 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup semifinal, where they were defeated by Arsenal on penalties.

In June 1998, Mihajlović represented FR Yugoslavia at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, playing all Yugoslav matches in the tournament. He scored a goal against Iran, and conceded an own goal against Germany. This made Mihajlović one of five players to score both a goal and an own goal in the World Cup; the other ones being Ernie Brandts, Ruud Krol, Gustavo Peña and Mario Mandžukić.

===Lazio===
In the summer of 1998, Mihajlović was brought to Lazio by head coach Sven-Göran Eriksson and club president Sergio Cragnotti for £8.5 million. He won his first trophy in Italy as Lazio beat Juventus in the Supercoppa Italiana during late August 1998. The club finished 7th in Serie A.

Strengthening the squad for a serious run at the Serie A title, in addition to Mihajlović, the summer 1998 transfer window also saw Cragnotti bring in Dejan Stanković from Red Star Belgrade, established goalscorer Marcelo Salas from River Plate, and finally striker Christian Vieri from Atlético Madrid.

With Lazio, Mihajlović reached the final of the 1999 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, winning the last edition of that competition with a 2–1 victory against RCD Mallorca. Lazio also won the 1999 UEFA Super Cup. Mihajlović played 26 times and scored seven goals during the 1999–2000 Serie A season as Lazio won their second &quot;Scudetto&quot;. Mihajlović completed the double by helping Lazio win the 2000 Coppa Italia.

Mihajlović represented Yugoslavia internationally again, at the Euro 2000 tournament. In the first Yugoslav game of the tournament, he was sent off against Slovenia. He served a one-game suspension before playing the last two games of the tournament.

Mihajlović won his last trophy with Lazio in 2004, beating Juventus in the Coppa Italia final.

===Inter Milan===
In 2004, Mihajlović was released from Lazio and joined his friend and former teammate Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan on a free transfer, signing a one-year deal. On 16 June 2005 Mihajlović signed a one-year extension. On 9 April 2006, in a league away game versus Ascoli, he scored his 27th career free-kick goal in the Serie A championship. He retired after the 2005–06 season.

During his time with Inter, he made 43 appearances and scored 6 goals, all from direct free kicks.

==International career==
Playing as a youth international, Mihajlović featured in 5 games at the 1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.

Between 1991 and 2003, Mihajlović was capped 63 times and scored 10 goals for the Yugoslavia/Serbia and Montenegro. He participated at the 1998 FIFA World Cup where he scored a free-kick against Iran as Yugoslavia reached the second round. He also participated at UEFA Euro 2000. He was sent off in Yugoslavia&#x27;s opening game against Slovenia but returned after a one match ban with Yugoslavia reaching the quarterfinal. His final international was a June 2003 European Championship qualification match away against Finland.

==Style of play==
Early into his playing career, Mihajlović marked himself out with an extraordinary long-distance striking, crossing, and passing ability. His precise curling yet hard-driven left-footed shot allowed him to score free-kick goals on a regular basis. A set-piece and penalty kick specialist, Mihajlović has said that he has scored free-kicks from as far as 35 yards, adding in a 2000 interview with BBC Sport: &quot;I like to shoot with a swerve into both sides of the net. I often try scoring directly from the corners.&quot;. Regarded as one of the greatest free kick takers of all time, he was capable of both scoring and creating chances from dead ball opportunities, and holds the record for the most goals in Serie A from free-kicks, alongside Andrea Pirlo, with 28 goals, as well as the record for second most goals from free kicks for a single Serie A club in all competitions, with 43, behind Alessandro Del Piero. Along with Giuseppe Signori, he is one of only two players who have scored a hat-trick from free kicks in Serie A, a feat which he accomplished during his time with Lazio, in a 5–2 win over Sampdoria, on 13 December 1998, during the 1998–99 season.

During his club career in Yugoslavia with Vojvodina and Red Star Belgrade as well as during his early spell at Roma, he played on the left side of midfield as winger, or as an attacking midfielder or second striker on occasion, where he was known for his stamina, speed, foot-work, and ability to cover the flank with his runs, as well as his excellent ball-striking ability with his left foot, and his ability to dictate attacking plays in midfield. Upon moving to Italy, midway through his first season in Serie A, Mihajlović was moved to the position of left back by Roma head coach Vujadin Boškov. The following season, under Roma&#x27;s new head coach Carlo Mazzone, he mostly continued at left back while occasionally being deployed as a defensive midfielder, although his performances in this position were somewhat inconsistent due to his limited tactical sense. In 1994, after transferring to Sampdoria under head coach Sven-Göran Eriksson, Mihajlović was moved to the centre of the team&#x27;s defensive line, and remained in this position for the rest of his career. He later excelled in this newfound centre back role, where he functioned as a sweeper, due to his consistent defensive displays, physique, intelligence, leadership, and tenacity, as well as his good technique, touch on the ball, and long passing ability, which enabled him to play the ball out from the back; he drew praise from manager Carlo Mazzone, in particular, who described him as one of the best players in the world in his position.

==Managerial career==
===Assistant at Inter Milan===
After retiring from playing at Inter Milan, Mihajlović began a coaching career at San Siro as assistant to head coach Roberto Mancini. Mihajlović and Mancini had played together for five seasons at Sampdoria and Lazio.

Mihajlović&#x27;s free-kick expertise has been praised by Zlatan Ibrahimović, who after several successful free-kicks thanked the then assistant coach Mihajlović who had trained him for two years at Inter.

Mancini was fired in June 2008 by club president Massimo Moratti at the end of the 2007–08 season to make way for José Mourinho. Mihajlović left the club at the same time.

===Bologna===
On 3 November 2008, Mihajlović was appointed to replace Daniele Arrigoni at Serie A relegation-battling club Bologna. His Serie A bench debut came on 8 November 2008 at home versus Roma. The match ended in a 1–1 draw. His tenure began with five consecutive league draws before a 5–2 victory against relegation rivals Torino on 13 December 2008.

Mihajlović was sacked by Bologna on 14 April 2009 in the wake of a 1–4 home defeat against Siena, which dragged the team back into the relegation zone with seven matches remaining in the season. His tenure suffered from media rumours that he had numerous high-profile disagreements with senior players at the club which led to the poor form that eventually cost him the job. Under new head coach Giuseppe Papadopulo, Bologna avoided relegation to the Serie B on the last day of the season with a win over Catania.

===Catania===
On 8 December 2009, Mihajlović was appointed new head coach of Catania, taking over from Gianluca Atzori.
 He signed a contract until June 2011 with &quot;gli elefanti&quot;, hiring Dario Marcolin—his former teammate at Lazio and colleague on Mancini&#x27;s coaching staff at Inter—to be his assistant. Arriving at the club last in Serie A, Mihajlović made his debut with a home loss against relegation rivals Livorno. However, the following week, his team beat heavily favoured Juventus away in Turin with a 1–2 scoreline.

A string of good results, together with a number of key January signings such as former Argentine international striker Maxi López, helped Mihajlović keep the team out of the relegation zone. On 13 March 2010, Catania won 3–1 against league leaders and Mihajlović&#x27;s former team Inter Milan.

Led by Mihajlović, Catania finished the season in 13th spot, well out of the relegation zone.

He resigned at the end of the season on 24 May 2010 amid reports linking him to incumbent UEFA Champions League winners Inter as a replacement for outgoing boss José Mourinho, which did not come to anything in the end.

===Fiorentina===
On 3 June 2010, Mihajlović was announced as the new head coach of Fiorentina, replacing outgoing Cesare Prandelli who had left the Tuscan club to become the manager of the Italy national team.

Fiorentina had finished the 2009–10 Serie A campaign in eleventh place, but had made the Champions League round-of-16 stage where they were eliminated by Bayern Munich on away goals. Mihajlović signed a two-year contract on a salary of just under €1 million per year. Mihajlović stated that making Europe was a realistic goal for the season.

====2010–11 season====
The team suffered poor form in the first part of the season, with injuries to some key players. They finished the first half of the season in twelfth spot. Mihajlović signed winger Valon Behrami from West Ham United, but the alternating home and away form improved only slightly as the head coach experimented with various tactical formations.

In February 2011, Fiorentina won on the road for the first time in the season with a win at Palermo. In March 2011, the team recorded two straight wins for the first time in the season, climbing up to eighth spot. The club finished the league season with 12 wins (only three of those away from home), 11 losses, and 15 draws, which secured ninth place – twelve points out of a European spot.

====2011–12 season====
During the summer 2011 transfer season, Mihajlović was strongly linked with a return to Inter in head coaching capacity, with some Italian papers even reporting the specific date of his unveiling at the &quot;nerazzurri&quot; following supposed successful negotiations with Inter&#x27;s sporting director Marco Branca. However, Mihajlović denied those claims, pledging to stay on in Florence.

The season began in August 2011, with a Coppa Italia win over AS Cittadella. However, poor league form including five matches without a win put Mihajlović&#x27;s position under pressure. At a home match against Genoa in October 2011, Fiorentina&#x27;s supporters shouted abuse from the terraces throughout the match with calls for Mihajlović&#x27;s sacking and even racist banners and chants targeting the coach&#x27;s ethnicity. The fans&#x27; verbal abuse of Mihajlović made headlines for the next couple of days and sections of Fiorentina support issued an apology to the coach by hanging a banner outside of the stadium. Mihajlović was sacked on 7 November 2011, one day after a 1–0 away loss to ChievoVerona. The team was in 13th place in the league with 12 points from 10 matches.

===Serbia===
In May 2012, the Football Association of Serbia signed Mihajlović to become the head coach of the Serbia national team until the end of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Serbia finished third in Group A of the qualifying phase in October 2013 after which he resigned.

===Sampdoria===
On 20 November 2013, Sampdoria named Mihajlović as the new head coach in place for Delio Rossi. He signed a one-year rolling contract with automatic extension in case of a successful escape from relegation in the ongoing season, with his assistant coach Nenad Sakić (a former Sampdoria player himself) following him too.

During his first season in charge, he guided Sampdoria to significant improvements in results and easily escaped relegation. He successively agreed to stay for one more season, after talks with new president Massimo Ferrero, who took over from the Garrone family in July 2014. In the first weeks of the 2014–15 season, he managed to obtain eight points and no defeats in the first four games of the season, overseeing quality performances from players such as Stefano Okaka. On 1 June 2015 he wrote an open letter to confirm his departure as the head coach of Sampdoria.

===Milan===

On 16 June 2015, Milan officially sacked Filippo Inzaghi, appointing Mihajlović as their new manager, with a contract until 30 June 2017. During his tenure at the club, he was highly praised for trusting and giving playing opportunities to Gianluigi Donnarumma, who was only 16 years old at the time. Mihajlović was sacked on 12 April 2016.

===Torino===

On 25 May 2016, Mihajlović was officially appointed as the new manager of Torino, taking over from Gian Piero Ventura. He made his debut on the &quot;Granata&quot; bench on 13 August 2016 at the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino with a 4–1 home win over Pro Vercelli in the third round of the Coppa Italia. Mihajlović fielded Torino with an aggressive 4-3-3 formation and by the midway point of the season registered a record for points (29) whilst under the presidency of Urbano Cairo, but a less brilliant second half of the season ended with Torino in ninth place. He was sacked on 4 January 2018 following a 2–0 defeat to Juventus in the Coppa Italia.

===Sporting CP===
On 18 June 2018, Mihajlović took over as manager of Sporting CP, signing a three-year contract with the Portuguese club. Nine days after his arrival, he was sacked due to change of executive staff.

===Return to Bologna===
On 28 January 2019, Bologna parted ways with Filippo Inzaghi due to a series of poor results, and Mihajlović took over at the club for the second time in his managerial career.

The team scored 30 points in his first 17 games, in comparison with 14 points achieved under Inzaghi; thanks to those results, Mihajlović managed to keep Bologna into the top flight with ease, and he was retained as manager for the following season.

On 13 July 2019, Mihajlović announced that he had been diagnosed with an acute form of leukemia, but that he planned to stay in charge of the club while undergoing treatment.

Mihajlović was sacked on 6 September 2022, after Bologna secured only three points from its first five matches in Serie A, ending his three-and-a-half-year spell with the club.

==Controversies==
===As a player===
Mihajlović developed and fostered a reputation as a hard-nosed, tough-tackling player with a short fuse and no fear. As such he had many physical and verbal run-ins with opposing players that occasionally spilled outside of the pitch.

Already known as a player not backing away from physical play, the 22-year-old was one of the main protagonists of the ill-tempered 1991 Yugoslav Cup Final between Red Star and Hajduk Split on 8 May 1991 at the JNA Stadium in front of 7,000 spectators. Although of secondary importance to Red Star, which was getting ready for the European Cup Final three weeks later, the match still featured a degree of tension due to pitting a Serbian side against a Croatian one in an atmosphere of inter-ethnic incidents between Croats and Croatian Serbs in eastern Slavonia and Dalmatia regions of SR Croatia, including Mihajlović&#x27;s hometown Borovo that saw a massacre only six days before the final. Early in the match Hajduk&#x27;s 23-year-old defender Igor Štimac and Mihajlović began insulting each other, and according to Mihajlović during one of their exchanges Štimac told him: &quot;I hope our guys kill all of your family in Borovo.&quot; In the 70th minute Mihajlović slid in for a hard tackle on another Hajduk player Grgica Kovač that led to play temporarily being stopped as both sets of players confronted each other. Mihajlović was led away by Hajduk player Ante Miše (the two knew each other as they were both from Borovo) who grabbed him by the hair while Red Star&#x27;s Ilija Najdoski grabbed Hajduk&#x27;s Slaven Bilić by the hair at which point Štimac jumped into the fracas with a raised fist attempting to punch Najdoski. Mihajlović received a second yellow for the challenge on Kovač, and the referee Adem Fazlagić also gave Štimac a second yellow, which meant both players got sent off.

Several years later, in October 2000, Mihajlović raised a storm of controversy due to allegedly directing racist remarks at Arsenal&#x27;s Patrick Vieira. The incident occurred during an ill-tempered Lazio vs Arsenal UEFA Champions League match on 17 October 2000 at Stadio Olimpico. Throughout the contest, Mihajlović had run-ins with several Arsenal players, including Martin Keown and Robert Pires. After the final whistle, Mihajlović and Vieira were seen trading insults and trying to get at one another physically before being restrained by teammates. After the match, Vieira spoke to the media, accusing Mihajlović of racist abuse, saying that Mihajlović had called him &quot;nero di merda&quot; (black piece of shit) or &quot;fucking black monkey.&quot; Mihajlović subsequently apologized, but contended that his words were in retaliation to Vieira calling him a &quot;zingaro di merda&quot; (Gypsy piece of shit). Two months later, in December 2000, Mihajlović came under police investigation over the event for possibly violating an anti-racism law in Italy. Italian investigators planned on using Mihajlović&#x27;s own post-game admission about insulting Vieira to file charges of violating a 1993 law that criminalizes the &quot;spreading ... of ideas based on racial or ethnic superiority or hate&quot;, but no charges were made. Six years later Mihajlović and Vieira became part of the same team when the Senegalese-born Frenchman joined Inter where Mihajlović was already assistant to head coach Roberto Mancini. Vieira was later one of the guests for Mihajlović&#x27;s testimonial match on 28 May 2007 in Novi Sad.

On 7 November 2003, Mihajlović received an eight-match suspension by UEFA for spitting at and kicking Chelsea&#x27;s Adrian Mutu during a Champions League group stage match. Six and a half years later, Mihajlović became the head coach of Fiorentina, where Mutu was playing at the time.

===As a manager===
A vocal and outspoken presence, known for his leadership, Mihajlović attracted much controversy throughout both his playing and coaching careers, for his political views and affiliations.

Amid Javier Clemente&#x27;s failure to qualify the Serbia national team for Euro 2008, and Serbian press reports that then Inter Milan assistant coach Mihajlović was set to take over, Mihajlović publicly came out against the Serbia FA (FSS) president Zvezdan Terzić, accusing him in October 2007 of &quot;giving national team call-ups to players [he had private contracts with] in order to boost their transfer value&quot;. Terzić did not directly respond to the accusation, which Mihajlović repeated several months later during early March 2008 in the wake of Terzić&#x27;s time on the run from Serbian law enforcement over accusations of player transfer fee skimming.

In May 2012, Mihajlović landed the Serbia national team head coaching job (under the new FA president Tomislav Karadžić) and instituted a new code-of-conduct to be signed by players called up for international duty. One of the central points was his insistence that players sing the national anthem before matches. On 28 May, after Adem Ljajić failed to do so despite signing the code-of-conduct, Mihajlović removed him from the national team.

In December 2012, Mihajlović sued football agent Zoran Đurić for libel over his claims expressed during SOS channel&#x27;s &quot;Total Soccer&quot; programme that &quot;sports agents Fali Ramadani and Sergio Berti have a large influence on Mihajlović&#x27;s national team squad selection&quot;.

In late March 2013, in the wake of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier loss to Croatia, Mihajlović and Terzić reignited their public feud from six years prior, with the former Serbian FA president—who had in the meantime returned to the country from being on the run and completed a prison term following a plea deal—repeating Đurić&#x27;s accusation about Mihajlović having &quot;his national team match day squads selected by Sergio Berti&quot;. Mihajlović announced plans to sue Terzić for libel over the remark.

==Personal life and death==
Mihajlović was married to Arianna Rapaccioni, an Italian former television presenter, with whom he had five children: three sons and two daughters. On 13 July 2019, Mihajlović announced that he had been diagnosed with an acute form of leukemia, but would stay on as manager of Bologna. He underwent a bone marrow transplant after three cycles of chemotherapy.

In October 2021, he became a grandfather, after his daughter Virginia gave birth to a daughter. The father is Alessandro Vogliacco, who, at the time, played for Genoa.

Mihajlović died on 16 December 2022 at a clinic in Rome, following complications of leukemia.

<doc id="1250742" wikidata="Q1034039" url="?curid=1250742" title="Canyon de Chelly National Monument">
<text>Canyon de Chelly National Monument ( ) was established on April 1, 1931, as a unit of the National Park Service. Located in northeastern Arizona, it is within the boundaries of the Navajo Nation and lies in the Four Corners region. Reflecting one of the longest continuously inhabited landscapes of North America, it preserves ruins of the indigenous tribes that lived in the area, from the Ancestral Puebloans (also known as the Anasazi) to the Navajo. The monument covers and encompasses the floors and rims of the three major canyons: de Chelly, del Muerto, and Monument. These canyons were cut by streams with headwaters in the Chuska Mountains just to the east of the monument. None of the land is federally owned. Canyon de Chelly is one of the most visited national monuments in the United States.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Chelly&quot; is a Spanish borrowing of the Navajo word&quot; &quot; (or &quot;Tsegi&quot;), which means &quot;rock canyon&quot; (literally &quot;inside the rock&quot; &lt; &quot;tsé&quot; &quot;rock&quot; + &quot;-yiʼ&quot; &quot;inside of, within&quot;). The Navajo pronunciation is . The Spanish pronunciation of &quot;de Chelly&quot; was adapted into English, apparently modeled on a French-like spelling pronunciation, and is now .

==History==

Canyon de Chelly is thought to have been sporadically occupied by Hopi Indians from &quot;circa&quot; 1300 to the early 1700s, when the Navajo then moved into the canyon from places in northern New Mexico. From that time forward it has served as a home for Navajo people before it was invaded by forces led by future New Mexico governor Lt. Antonio Narbona in 1805, during which time 115 Navajos were slain and 33 taken captive. In 1863, Col. Kit Carson sent troops through the canyon, killing 23 Navajo, seizing 200 sheep, and destroying hogans, as well as peach orchards and other crops. The resulting demoralization led to the surrender of the Navajos and their removal to Bosque Redondo, New Mexico.

==Description==
Canyon de Chelly is entirely owned by the Navajo Tribal Trust of the Navajo Nation. It is the only National Park Service unit that is owned and cooperatively managed in this manner. About 40 Navajo families live in the park. Access to the canyon floor is restricted, and visitors are allowed to travel in the canyons only when accompanied by a park ranger or an authorized Navajo guide. The only exception to this rule is the White House Ruin Trail. This trail has reopened from 2 August 2024 to 29 September 2024 without a fee; it will again reopen seasonally in April 2025, with exact times &amp; fees to be determined.
The park&#x27;s distinctive geologic feature, Spider Rock, is a sandstone spire that rises from the canyon floor at the junction of Canyon de Chelly and Monument Canyon. Spider Rock can be seen from South Rim Drive. It has served as the scene of a number of television commercials. According to traditional Navajo beliefs, the taller of the two spires is the home of Spider Grandmother.

Most park visitors arrive by automobile and view Canyon de Chelly from the rim, following both North Rim Drive and South Rim Drive. Ancient ruins and geologic structures are visible, but in the distance, from turnoffs on each of these routes. Deep within the park is Mummy Cave. It features structures that have been built at various times in history. Private Navajo-owned companies offer tours of the canyon floor by horseback, hiking or four-wheel drive vehicle. The companies can be contacted directly for prices and arrangements. No entrance fee is charged to enter the park, apart from any charges imposed by tour companies. Commercial air tours are to be banned starting June 2025, barring legal challenges to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Park Service Dec. 2024 Air Tour Management Plan decision.

Accommodations for visitors are located in the vicinity of the canyon, on the road leading to Chinle, which is the nearest town.

The National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 1970.

<text>Cape Krusenstern National Monument and the colocated Cape Krusenstern Archeological District is a U.S. National Monument and a National Historic Landmark centered on Cape Krusenstern in northwestern Alaska. The national monument was one of fifteen new National Park Service units designated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980. It was initially declared a national monument under the authority of the Antiquities Act by President Jimmy Carter on December 1, 1978.

Cape Krusenstern is primarily a coastal plain, containing large lagoons and rolling hills of limestone. The bluffs record thousands of years of change in the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea, as well as evidence of some 9,000 years of human habitation. The park&#x27;s central features, 114 beach ridges at the eponymous cape, alternate between sandy and gravelly ridges and narrow ponds. Located entirely above the Arctic Circle in a region of permafrost, the monument&#x27;s lands include typical thermokarst features.

==Description==
Cape Krusenstern National Monument comprises the coast of the Chukchi Sea from the opening of the Hotham Inlet at the mouth of the Kobuk River, extending northwards along the coast to a point just short of Imikruk Lagoon. It extends inland about , with a high point in the north at Kikmiksot Mountain () in the Mulgrave Hills and in the south at Mount Noak () in the Igichuk Hills. The coastline is marked by a series of lagoons separated from the sea by sandspits. The largest is the Krusenstern Lagoon at Cape Krusenstern. Others include the Kotlik, Imik and Aukulak Lagoons.

The local bedrock is composed of limestone, dolomite, phyllite and chert from the Precambrian through Devonian times. The land was glaciated during the Illinoian glaciation, but was free of permanent ice during the Wisconsonian glaciation. Longshore currents have deposited beach ridges since then for 6,000 years.

===Archaeological district===
The archeological district comprises 114 ancient beach ridges which formed approximately 60 years apart. They provide a sequential look at over 5000 years of habitation. The area in the National Historic Landmark is vast, making this one of the largest NHLs in the U.S., along with the Adirondack Park. The national historic landmark was designated on November 7, 1973.

The beach ridges are the primary reason for the area&#x27;s preservation, which serves to safeguard evidence of 5,000 years of occupation by the Inupiat people, and more than 9,000 years of human occupation. Initial investigations by archaeologist J. Louis Giddings in the late 1940s found campsites on the cape as much as 4,000 years old, and even older sites on the mainland. University of Washington researchers have undertaken several years of excavations to document about one third of the beach complex. Researchers found campsites, hearths and animal bones, with a few stone tools and pieces of pottery. In newer locations the team documented the remains of semi-subterranean houses built into the beach ridges, such as the Old Whaling site.

The oldest mainland sites such as Battle Rock, Rabbit Mountain and the Lower Bench date to the Paleo-Arctic tradition, about 10,000 to 7,000 years before present. Similar materials have been recovered in the Trail Creek caves of Bering Land Bridge National Preserve on the Seward Peninsula. The Palisades site has yielded materials from the Northern Archaic period dating to about 6,000 years before the present. Later periods described in the region include the Arctic Small Tool tradition and the Northern Maritime tradition. The western Thule culture, which used dogs and seal oil extended from 950 AD to 1400, and was succeeded by the Kotzebue culture from about 1400 to about 1850, when Europeans began to affect native cultures. Kotzebue sites are widespread within the monument.

===Later history===

Europeans visited the Cape Krusenstern region to pursue whales beginning in the 1850s. During the American Civil War the Confederate raider &quot;CSS Shenandoah&quot; captured whalers in the area.

In early modern times the Kotzebue area was the site of Qatnut, a kind of trade fair for the region&#x27;s native people. Qatnut is still celebrated in modern times in the city of Kotzebue, Alaska every other summer. A short-lived gold rush brought prospectors to the Seward Peninsula and Kotzebue in the 1890s. A few 20th century structures exist in the monument, including an Alaska Road Commission cabin at Anigaaq that has been evaluated for historic significance. In the 1950s the area&#x27;s lack of good natural harbors, a desire to develop the Alaskan frontier facing the Soviet Union and the Operation Plowshare drive for the peaceful use of nuclear weapons brought proposals for Operation Chariot, a proposed deepwater harbor at Cape Thompson northwest of the monument, to be excavated using nuclear devices. The project, though popular elsewhere in Alaska, was opposed by native leaders and was discarded.

==Ecology and environment==

The lands within the monument, which lies entirely above the Arctic Circle, are all tundra in which the permafrost dominates soils and vegetation. The monument is in a permafrost region. In the lowland areas the land is shaped by thermokarst forces. Typical thermokarst features seen in the monument include pingos, polygon ice wedges and thaw ponds. Low vegetation covers the land, mainly in tussocks of cottongrass, with shrubby growth of willow, Labrador tea, dwarf birch, mountain alder and other species in moist tundra areas. Wetter areas in the southern part of the monument feature grasses and sedges. Upland regions are Arctic tundra, with lichen, saxifrage, willow and heather. Few trees grow, and the white spruce that do grow are confined to the southeastern corner of the monument.

The coastal region supports a variety of large terrestrial and marine mammals. The abundant caribou are part of the West. Large predators include brown bears and wolf packs. Smaller mammals include snowshoe and Arctic hares, weasels, minks, otters, porcupines and a few wolverines. Marine mammals in or near monument waters include fin, bowhead, gray and beluga whales. Seal species include ringed, spotted, bearded and ribbon seals, with occasional walruses. Ringed seals are hunted by native subsistence hunters, and occasionally beluga whales and walrus are hunted as well.

Fish species include five species of salmon, burbot, several species of whitefish, Arctic char, Dolly Varden trout, herring and northern pike.

Water birds of all kinds nest in the monument. Nesting species include tundra swan, mallard, green-winged teal, common eider, Canada goose, and horned and red-necked grebes. Sandhill cranes also nest on the tundra, with common, Arctic and yellow-billed loons. Seabirds include glaucous gulls, Arctic terns, long-tailed jaegers and common murres. Landbirds include willow and rock ptarmigans. Predatory landbirds include peregrine falcons, snowy owls and goshawks. Endangered species at Cape Krusenstern include the possibly extinct Eskimo curlew, and threatened spectacled eider and Steller&#x27;s eider.

Weather in the coastal monument is subject to extremes. Average low temperatures in January are , and can reach nighttime lows of . Summer temperatures average around , and can reach . Since the park is above the Arctic Circle, the sun does not set from June 3 to July 9, and the sun is visible for only hours on the winter solstice, with long periods of twilight on either side of sunrise and sunset. As is the case over all of northern Alaska, the aurora borealis is often visible on winter nights when solar activity is high. Snow can happen at any time of the year. The coast can be stormy, with winds of to . Visitors must take care against hypothermia in the cool, damp environment.

===Mining===
The Red Dog mine is the world&#x27;s largest zinc mine. The mine opened in 1989, located about northeast of the monument, close to Noatak National Preserve on land owned by the NANA Regional Corporation, an Alaskan native corporation. The mine is operated by Teck Cominco Alaska. A haul road from the mine crosses monument lands to a small port facility on the monument&#x27;s shore a few miles south of the northern boundary, from which the concentrated lead and zinc powder is shipped during the 100 ice-free days of the year. About of the road are within the monument. A 2006 study measured high lead and cadmium concentrations in voles and birds sampled near the road compared to those at a control location. The animal sample was a follow-up to an earlier study that found elevated lead and cadmium levels in mosses near the road. The contamination is attributed to dust blown from trucks on the haul road. Following the first study changes were made to the trucks to contain dust and a sampling program was put into effect to monitor dust release.

==History and administration==

Cape Krusenstern National Monument was established as one of fifteen new National Park Service properties established by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980. It was first declared a national monument by President Jimmy Carter on December 1, 1978 using his authority under the Antiquities Act when Congressional negotiations on the proposed ANILCA bill were stalled. ANILCA was finally passed in 1980, and signed by Carter on December 2, 1980. As is the case in most national park lands in Alaska, subsistence hunting by local residents is permitted. No part of the monument is designated as a national preserve, which would allow sport hunting. About 19% of monument lands are owned by native corporations.

The monument&#x27;s headquarters are at the Northwest Arctic Heritage Center in Kotzebue, across the Hotham Inlet from Cape Krusenstern. Offices and visitor services for Kobuk Valley National Park and Noatak National Preserve are in the same facility. The units are managed together as the Western Arctic National Parklands, with a single Park Service superintendent in charge.

<text>Oakham School is a public school (English fee-charging boarding and day school) in Oakham, Rutland, England.

The school was founded in 1584 by Archdeacon Robert Johnson, along with Uppingham School, a few miles away. They share a common badge design (and a strong rivalry), but while Uppingham&#x27;s colours tend towards blue and white, Oakham&#x27;s are black and red.

Under headmaster John Buchanan, in 1971 Oakham was the first boys&#x27; independent secondary school in Britain to accept both male and female pupils throughout the whole school and not just in the sixth form. In 1995, it was the first public school to go on-line.

==History==

Oakham School was founded in 1584 by Robert Johnson, Archdeacon of Leicester. Johnson received an income from four church positions and used this wealth to set up a number of charitable institutions, including the two free grammar schools at Oakham and Uppingham. As someone on the Puritan wing of the Church of England he had a strong belief in the benefits of education.

According to Johnson&#x27;s statutes for the school, &quot;the schoolmaster shall teach all those grammar scholars that are brought up in Oakham, freely without pay, if their parents be poor and not able to pay, and keep them constantly to school.&quot; The master of the school was to teach Hebrew, Latin and Greek. Although the schooling was free, permanent attendance meant the loss to a family of an income, so not many very poor would have attended, or wanted the education. The master could supplement his income of £24 per year by taking in boarders. Johnson was careful to ensure that his schools were sufficiently endowed. This endowment was confirmed by royal charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I.

The original school building was restored in the eighteenth century and remained the sole classroom for 300 years. In 1749 a case involving payment of rates recorded that &quot;the school of Uppingham is not nor hath been of equal repute with that of Oakham.&quot; The headmastership of John Doncaster (1808–46), himself a previous pupil at the school, saw the school advance academically: &quot;This was the man who returned to his old school at the age of thirty-six, with University honours and university experience, to give it fresh life, and to set a mark on it which it never quite lost&quot;. Even so, numbers attending were well below 50, and while Uppingham flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century, Oakham did not to the same extent. Even so, in 1869 Oakham was one of the founding members of the Headmasters&#x27; Conference (HMC). In 1875 as a result of the Endowed Schools Act 1869 that threatened the continued existence of the school, there were just 2 day boys and 2 boarders in the school. The exhausted headmaster, William Spicer Wood (1846–75), retired and the new headmaster lasted just three years before being dismissed.

All classes were still taught in the one room - the original old school, which still exists next to the parish church. The school did see some development. Science and modern languages had recently been added to the curriculum. The subjects examined for a scholarship within the school were English history (1066-1603), geography of the British Isles, English grammar, arithmetic, English composition and dictation. A more successful headmaster, E. V. Hodge, headmaster from 1879 to 1902, saw numbers increase, to 125 in 1896, with slightly more boarders than day boys. Then followed onto the scene three successful headmasters - Walter Lee Sargant (1902–29) under whom numbers rose to over 200 with consequent new buildings, Francis Cecil Doherty (1929–34), who went on to be headmaster of Lancing), and Grosvenor Talbot Griffith (1935–57) who took the numbers to over three hundred - before the advent of John Buchanan.

The 125 of Hodge&#x27;s time was a temporary peak - by 1905 numbers had fallen back to 66. Sargant&#x27;s response to the obvious financial difficulties which accompanied this decline (there were just 80 boys in the school when he commenced his headmastership) was to apply in 1910 for direct grant status, and to become in effect the boys&#x27; grammar school for Rutland at the same time as continuing as a public school for the boarders. New facilities for science teaching were created, boarding accommodation was improved with new building and extensions, and then a new school house was built. Pupil numbers rose again, to 105 in 1910, and to 200 in 1923.

The Memorial Chapel was dedicated on 29 October 1925; it was built as a memorial to the 68 old boys and masters who were killed in the First World War. The Memorial Library was opened in 1955 by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester as a memorial to the 82 old boys who were killed in the Second World War.

John David Buchanan took over from Talbot Griffith in 1958, and played himself in quietly until the Circular 10/65 which demanded comprehensivisation of maintained schools, of which Oakham was one as a direct grant school for the Rutland dayboys. He and the Rutland Local Education Authority did not agree on the possibilities of re-organisation of Rutland&#x27;s schools, and as a result in 1970 the school (then 700 in size, all boys) reverted to full independence from the local authority, and in 1971, Oakham admitted female pupils for the first time, with the intention from the beginning of being co-educational throughout. The school is co-educational throughout the whole age range (10-18), with an approximately 50:50 split at all levels (ca. 550 boys and 500 girls in 2011–12). There are an equal number of girls&#x27; houses (8) to boys&#x27; houses. When Buchanan retired in 1977 the school was 950 in total size (ca. 550 boys and 400 girls), and the next headmaster, Richard Bull (1977–84, before he went on to be headmaster of Rugby) continued the co-education process; but it was not until 1990 that the process was completed during the headmastership of Graham Smallbone (1985–96) and equality of numbers gained. When Tony Little, later headmaster of Eton, took over in 1996 there were 528 boys and 510 girls in a school of 1038. Furthermore, the school is evenly spread between boarders and day, although there do exist &quot;day boarders&quot; from 13 and &quot;transitional boarders&quot; from 10 to 13.

In 1981, the school was the subject of an action brought by Novello &amp; Co and the Music Publishers Association (UK) for photocopying sheet music for Christmas carols. This was the first case of its kind in the UK. The High Court settlement ordered the school to pay £4250 in damages plus costs.

In 1984 the quatercentenary of the school was celebrated by a visit from Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

In 2005 Oakham School was one of fifty independent schools found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel which had allowed them to drive up fees for thousands of parents. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared.

==Lower school==

The current school set-up comprises three distinct &quot;levels&quot; of education. The lower school, for children aged 10–13, is also known as &quot;Jerwoods&quot; after the benefactor Old Oakhamian John Jerwood. The buildings that comprise it mostly date back to the early 1970s, when the four houses that comprise the area were established, but the main building, now part of the boys&#x27; boarding site known as &#x27;Hodges&#x27;, was the old vicarage, which was bought by the school in 1870. The girls&#x27; boarding site, formally Lincoln house, is in a round building to the west. The four Houses have both day and boarding students, Sargants and Peterborough for boys and Ancaster and Lincoln for girls, are found on different floors of the main eastern building, which also houses all seven classrooms. During their time in the lower school, pupils study all of the core subjects (mathematics, English, science, history and geography) as well as French and either German or Spanish, religious education, Latin, Design &amp; Technology and ICT. There is also a carousel system of creative and performing arts courses, which include textiles, 2D art and sculpture, and a separate carousel for drama and dance, and pupils take part in a physical education scheme of swimming and general ball skills.

==Middle school==
All pupils study English (language and literature), mathematics, a dual-award science course, and a foreign language (French, German or Spanish) to GCSE, as well as at least two of history, geography and RP (Religion &amp; Philosophy). Pupils then choose two subjects from a selection, including a second foreign language, drama and theatre studies, Textiles, Painting, Sculpture, Design &amp; Technology, sports science and a combined Greek and Latin course.

There are ten houses in the middle school, six boarding and four day houses, split evenly between boys and girls. The day houses are located at the north end of campus, in the grounds of the former Oakham Workhouse, later Catmose Vale Hospital. The main building houses the two girls&#x27; houses, Gunthorpe and Hambleton, while the boys&#x27; houses, Barrow and Clipsham, are in a newer house alongside. The Girls Full-boarding houses, Rushbrokes and Buchanans, are just south of the Schanschieff day site. The Girls transitional boarding house, Stevens, is located alongside the boys counterpart, Wharflands, in the center of the campus. The boys full-boarding houses Chapmans and Haywoods are on Kilburn road ( the western-most part of the campus)

==Upper school==
Oakham offers both the International Baccalaureate (IB) and AS/A2 levels.

===AS/A2 levels===
Most students take four subjects at AS Level and continue to A2 level in at least three of those subjects.

===International Baccalaureate (IB)===
In the upper school, all students take six subjects.

In 2019, 49.34% of pupils scored A*-A for their A-Levels examination, whereas 51.88% scored A*-A for their GCSEs. The average IB score for students in 2019 was 36.7.

==Houses==
Oakham School has a total of 16 houses; 2 in the upper school (1 for boys and 1 for girls), 10 in the middle school (5 boys houses, 5 girls; 4 full boarding, 2 flexi-boarding, 4 day) and 4 in the lower school (Jerwoods) (2 boys, 2 girls).

===Upper school===
There are two houses for the seventh form, School House for boys and Round House for girls. Both are in Chapel Close.

==Sport==

Oakham offers a range of sports to its pupils; main sports for boys are rugby (Daily Mail champions twice), hockey, cricket and athletics, and for girls are hockey, netball, tennis and athletics. The school has won the Ashburton Shield in shooting on three occasions. OO RSF Shouler won the Queens Prize at the imperial meeting in 2021 Sovereign&#x27;s Prize.

The school offers, both the Combined Cadet Force and The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award; in the latter it has gained awards at the three levels of bronze, silver and gold. In November 2000 the Duke of Edinburgh came to the school to present the 1000th Gold Award.

Oakham have won the National Schools cup final in rugby three times, 2002, 2003, and 2023.

Prior to 2003 Leicestershire County Cricket Club occasionally played games on the school grounds.
