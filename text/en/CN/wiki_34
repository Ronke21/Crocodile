<text>Auckland City () was a territorial authority with city status covering the central isthmus of the urban area of Auckland, New Zealand. It was governed by the Auckland City Council from 1989 to 2010, and as a territory within the wider Auckland Region, was also governed by Auckland Regional Council. Auckland City was disestablished as a local authority on 1 November 2010, when Auckland City Council was amalgamated with other councils of the Auckland Region into the new Auckland Council. At the time of its disestablishment, the city had a resident population of around 450,000.

The Auckland City included the Auckland CBD – a major financial and commercial centre – the surrounding suburbs, and Hauraki Gulf islands such as Waiheke and Great Barrier Island.

==Geography==
The mainland part of Auckland City occupied the Auckland isthmus, also known as the Tāmaki isthmus. The Waitematā Harbour, which opens to the Hauraki Gulf, separated North Shore City from the isthmus. The Manukau Harbour, which opens to the Tasman Sea, separated Manukau City from the isthmus. The distance between the two harbours is particularly narrow at each end of the isthmus. At the western end, the Whau River, an estuarial arm of the Waitematā Harbour, comes within two kilometres of the waters of the Manukau Harbour on the west coast and marks the beginning of the Northland Peninsula. A few kilometres to the southeast at Ōtāhuhu, the Tāmaki River, an arm of the Hauraki Gulf on the east coast, comes just 1200 metres from the Manukau&#x27;s waters. Being part of the Auckland volcanic field, much of the isthmus is mantled with volcanic rocks and soils, and several prominent scoria cones dot the isthmus.

Many Hauraki Gulf islands were part of Auckland City. Such islands of the inner gulf included Rangitoto, Motutapu, Browns Island, Motuihe, Rakino, Ponui and Waiheke, while the outer gulf islands included Little Barrier Island, Great Barrier and the Mokohinau Islands.

== Local government ==
In November 1989, central government restructured local authorities throughout New Zealand. After substantial protests and legal challenges, Auckland City was merged with eight smaller local authorities to form a new Auckland City Council. The new Auckland City had double the population of the old. However, amalgamation, forced onto local authorities often against their will, was criticised to have led to less democracy and higher rates for the same services.

A further restructuring and amalgamation brought all seven councils in the area and the Auckland Regional Council into one &quot;SuperCity&quot; (Auckland Council), starting 1 November 2010.

===Coat of arms===
== Demography ==

Auckland City was the most populous local authority in the country, with a population of 450,300 at 30 June 2010. In 2010 it was made up of 188 ethnic groups, making it New Zealand&#x27;s most diverse city, and slightly more diverse than in 2007, when 185 ethnic groups had been counted. In 2010, the life expectancy was 83 years for women, and 79.6 years for men, while the average age of the population was 33.4 years, with 35.9 years for the whole country.

In 2009, Auckland was rated the fourth-best place to live in the world, in human resources consultancy Mercer&#x27;s annual survey.

== Economy ==

In the year to March 2009, Auckland City had 353,000 jobs, of which 26.3% was held by property and business services, as well as 65,655 businesses, making up 13.1% of New Zealand&#x27;s businesses and 16.2% of New Zealand&#x27;s jobs. Over 2009 to the month of March, Auckland City&#x27;s unemployment rate increased to 5.6%, compared to the overall New Zealand unemployment rate of 4.5%. In addition the city&#x27;s economic output declined by 2.4%. Gareth Stiven, the economic manager of Auckland City, stated that this was because the city&#x27;s economy was heavily involved with service industries, such as banking and insurance, which were affected by financial crises. However, over the last five years of its existence, Auckland&#x27;s economic growth averaged 1.4% each year, higher than the average of the region and the nation.

In 2003 three of the ten largest companies in New Zealand (Air New Zealand, Fletcher Building, and Foodstuffs) were headquartered in Auckland City. Many large corporations were housed within Auckland CBD, the central part of Auckland City.

Air New Zealand has its worldwide headquarters, called &quot;The Hub&quot;, off Beaumont and Fanshawe Streets in the Western Reclamation; the airline moved there from the Auckland CBD in 2006. In September 2003 Air New Zealand was the only one of the very largest corporations in New Zealand to have its headquarters within the Auckland CBD.

<text>The Countess Kathleen and Various Legends and Lyrics (1892) is the second poetry collection of W. B. Yeats.

It includes the play &quot;The Countess Cathleen&quot; and group of shorter lyrics that Yeats would later collect under the title of &quot;The Rose&quot; in his &quot;Collected Poems&quot;.

This volume includes several of Yeats&#x27; most popular poems, including &quot;The Lake Isle of Innisfree&quot;, &quot;A Faery Song&quot;, &quot;When You are Old&quot;, and &quot;Who Goes with Fergus&quot;. (The last is sung by Stephen Dedalus to his mother as she lies dying in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.)

Many of these poems also reflect Yeats&#x27; new-discovered interest in alchemy and esotericism.

<text>The Egg Bowl (traditionally named the “Battle for the Golden Egg”) is the name given to the Mississippi State–Ole Miss football rivalry. It is an American college football rivalry game played annually between Southeastern Conference members Mississippi State University and Ole Miss (The University of Mississippi).

The teams first played each other in 1901. Since 1927 the winning squad has been awarded possession of The Golden Egg trophy. The game has been played every year since 1944, making it the tenth longest uninterrupted series in the United States. Ole Miss leads the series 66–46–6 through the 2024 season.

The game is an example of the intrastate sports rivalries between two public universities, one often bearing the state&#x27;s name alone, and the other often being a land-grant university named a &quot;State University&quot;. Like most such rivalries, it is contested at the end of the regular season, in this case during the Thanksgiving weekend. The Egg Bowl has been played on Thanksgiving 23 times, including from 1998 to 2003, in 2013, and from 2017 to 2023. The game now alternates between the two respective campuses. Contests in odd-numbered years are played in Starkville, Mississippi at Miss St, and even-numbered years in Oxford, Mississippi at Ole Miss.

==Series history==
The first game in the series was played on October 28, 1901, at Mississippi State. Mississippi State, defeated Ole Miss, nicknamed the Red and Blue at that time, by a final score of 17–0. The two squads met on the gridiron every year from 1901 until 1911 and then, after a three-year hiatus, resumed the series in 1915; since that 1915 meeting the two teams have met on the field every season with the exception of the 1943 season, when neither school fielded teams due to World War II.

From 1973 through 1990, the game was played at Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium in Jackson, which seats about 62,000. The stadium was centrally located in the state and the state&#x27;s only venue capable of seating the anticipated crowd; for many years Vaught–Hemingway Stadium in Oxford seated only about 32,000 and Scott Field in Starkville seated only about 31,000. Both campus venues have been considerably expanded and are now capable of accommodating the expected crowds, and both have been continually upgraded to the point where they are superior in amenities to Veterans Memorial Stadium.

At one point the level of intensity was such that a victory by one of the schools in this game could salvage what had otherwise been a poor season. This dynamic has proven not to be applicable every year, however; in 2004 Ole Miss won the game but fired its coach, David Cutcliffe, the next year following a disappointing season.
Mississippi State dominated the first part of the series with a 17–5–1 record against Ole Miss. However, Ole Miss leads the series, in part due to its performance in the rivalry under Johnny Vaught, who went 19–2–4 against Mississippi State, and later by Billy Brewer who went 8-3. Ole Miss has a similar advantage in winning percentage in games played both in Oxford and Starkville. 

===The Golden Egg trophy===
The Bulldogs (Mississippi State) dominated the early days of the series including a 13-game A&amp;M winning streak from 1911 to 1925 during which time the bulldogs outscored the Red and Blue by a combined 327–33. Through 1925 Ole Miss had won only five times out of 23 total contests. In 1926 when the Red and Blue ended their 13-game losing streak by defeating A&amp;M 7–6 in Starkville, the Ole Miss fans rushed the field with some trying to tear the goalposts down. Mississippi State fans did not take well to the Ole Miss fans destroying their property and fights broke out. Some State fans defended the goal posts with wooden chairs, and several injuries were reported. According to one account:

To prevent such events in the future, students of the two schools created The Golden Egg, a large trophy which has been awarded to the winning team each year since 1927. In the event of a tie, the school that won the game the previous year kept the trophy for the first half of the new year and then the trophy was sent to the other school for the second half of the new year.

The trophy is a large football-shaped brass piece mounted to a wooden base and traditionally symbolizes supremacy in college football in the state of Mississippi for the year. The footballs used in American football in the 1920s were considerably more ovoid and blunter than those in use today and similar to the balls still used in rugby; the trophy thus, to modern eyes, more resembles an egg than a football.

The game was given the nickname &quot;Egg Bowl&quot; by &quot;The Clarion-Ledger&quot; sportswriter Tom Patterson in 1979.

==Notable games==

*1901: The first ever meeting between the two schools was delayed for 40 minutes because of a dispute between the rivals over the eligibility of A&amp;M&#x27;s Norvin E. (Billy) Green, who had played for the Ole Miss squad the year before. Eventually it was agreed that Green would not play and the game kicked off with A&amp;M going on to win by a score of 17–0.
*1902: The second contest resulted in the first Ole Miss victory by a score of 21–0. 
*1903: The third meeting between the Aggies and the Red and Blue resulted in the first tie in series history and marked the first time that neither team was shut out. A&amp;M entered the contest undefeated, untied, and unscored upon. A&amp;M led 6–0 for most of the games, but Ole Miss tied the score with less than a minute to go when halfback Fred Elmer went 70 yards for a touchdown and Edgar Moss kicked the extra point to make it 6–6 (touchdowns were worth 5 points at the time). Those were the only points that the Aggies would surrender that season, as they went to tie Tulane in their final contest of the season by a score of 0–0.
*1904: This marked the first time that the game was played off campus, with the two squads meeting at the Mississippi and West Alabama Fairgrounds as part of the fair. Ole Miss went on to win 17–5.
*1905: This game featured two firsts, the first time the game was played in Jackson and the first time the game was played on Thanksgiving. The games was held at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds and because there was no barrier to stop them, the crowd poured out onto the playing field for a closer look at what, for many, was their first college game. The curious got so close that at one point, the Ole Miss captain refused to continue until the field was cleared. A&amp;M won 11–0.
*1906 – Passing Fancy: James C. Elmer of Ole Miss caught the first forward pass in the history of the rivalry. Elmer&#x27;s kicking accounted for 13 points in a 29-5 rout. For the first time the game marked the end of the season for not one but both teams.
*1907: Ole Miss and Mississippi A&amp;M played a scoreless first half in extremely muddy conditions. Before the second half began, Ole Miss head coach Frank A. Mason brought out an urn filled with whisky-laced coffee in an attempt to warm his players. Sloppy second-half play resulted in a 15-0 A&amp;M victory. After the game, many of the Ole Miss players blamed Mason for the loss. When asked if his team was returning home that night, Mason replied &quot;Yes, the team is going north at 11 o&#x27;clock. I&#x27;m going in another direction, and hope I never see them again!&quot; It would be his final game as head coach.
*1908: With a 44–6 victory the Aggies became the first of the squads to claim consecutive wins in the series. A&amp;M scored a total of eight touchdowns (only worth five points at that time) in the game.
*1911: Earlier that week a new set of stands had been added on the east side of The Fairgrounds in Jackson. As the teams prepared for kickoff the new stands collapsed injuring at least 60 people, some seriously. Despite the disaster, the game proceeded without interruption and resulted in A&amp;M winning 6-0. The Aggies would end the season in Havana, Cuba for their first ever postseason appearance, a 12–0 victory over the Havana Athletic Club in the Bacardi Bowl.
*1915: After a three-year hiatus the two squads met on the gridiron in a game played in Tupelo. A&amp;M rolled to a 65–0 victory. The contest remains the most one-sided in series history.
*1918 – Gotcha! Twice!: This marked the only time that the two teams would square off twice in the same season. A&amp;M won the first game in Starkville 34–0 and completed the sweep taking the second in Oxford 13–0. The Rebels were coached that season by legendary future A&amp;M baseball coach C.R. &quot;Dudy&quot; Noble
*1926 – A&amp;M&#x27;s Streak Ends: Ole Miss ended a 13-game losing streak to A&amp;M with a 7-6 win in Starkville. The ensuing melee between fans prompted the purchase of a football-shaped trophy to be awarded to the winner each year upon their victory, and kept on their respective campus until the game was played again the following year.
*1927 – First Game for The Trophy: In the first game after the commissioning of the Golden Egg Trophy was played on Thanksgiving Day in Oxford. Ole Miss posted back-to-back wins against A&amp;M for the first time since 1909–10, winning 20–12.
*1936: Mississippi State got its first win in the series since the creation of the Golden Egg ending an Ole Miss 10-game unbeaten streak (9–0–1) in the series by a final score of 26–6.
*1964: The 17-year unbeaten streak (14–0–3) by Ole Miss against MSU came to an end as the Bulldogs claimed a 20–17 victory.
*1976 and 1977: Mississippi State won the Egg Bowl these two years but had to forfeit the wins due to NCAA sanctions.
*1983 – The Immaculate Deflection, or the Wind Bowl: In what has become known to Ole Miss and State fans as &quot;The Immaculate Deflection,&quot; the 1983 Egg Bowl played in Jackson is notable because the wind helped preserve Ole Miss&#x27; 24–23 victory. Down by a point with 24 seconds left in the game, State kicked what would have been a 27-yard game-winning field goal. Bulldog freshman kicker Artie Cosby kicked it straight and long and what appeared to be over the crossbar, but as the ball reached the goal posts, a 40 mph gusting wind suspended the ball midair before it reached the uprights, after which it fell short of the goal post, securing the victory for the Rebels.
*1991 – Back to Campus: In the first Egg Bowl played on either campus since 1972 and the first played at Starkville since 1971, first year head coach Jackie Sherrill led the Bulldogs to a 24–9 win, State&#x27;s first over Ole Miss in Starkville since 1942, ending an 0–11–3 drought. 
*1992 – The Stand: In a defensive struggle that saw a combined 12 turnovers between the two, a goal line stand of epic proportions by the &quot;Red Death&quot; defense ultimately gave Ole Miss the win. State had 11 plays on consecutive possessions inside the Rebel 10 with under four minutes to play, but Ole Miss kept them out of the end zone. The first possession ended on a third down pass that was intercepted in the end zone by Michael Lowery who returned the ball out to the 2-yard line. A couple of plays later, Rebel running back Cory Philpot fumbled the ball back to the Dogs, the Rebels&#x27; 7th turnover on the day. On the ensuing possession, MSU had fourth and goal and the pass was incomplete. However, pass interference on Orlanda Truitt kept the drive alive, moving the ball to the 2. However, the next four plays resulted in negative yardage, with the final pass falling incomplete with only 20 seconds remaining. The Rebels won 17–10.
*1997: The 1997 contest was notable for two things: first for the melee that broke out between the teams before the game kicked off and second for the dramatic way in which it ended. Trailing 14–7 with 2:12 remaining the Rebels put together a 64-yard drive that culminated with a 10-yard TD pass to WR Andre Rone. Ole Miss then elected to attempt a two-point conversion to take the lead rather than kick the extra point for the tie. Rebel QB Stewart Patridge completed a pass Cory Peterson with 25 seconds left that gave Ole Miss a 15–14 lead. A late pass by Mississippi State was intercepted by Ole Miss DB Tim Strickland to secure the win for the Rebels. Both teams finished the regular season 7-4, but only Ole Miss was invited to a bowl game, their first since 1992. 
*1998: Mississippi State clinched the SEC West division title after winning 28–6. This win sent MSU to the SEC Championship Game (the first and currently only time a Mississippi team has played for the SEC Championship) where they were defeated 24–14 by eventual national champion Tennessee. This was also Tommy Tuberville&#x27;s last game as Ole Miss coach. Tuberville departed two days after this game to accept the same position at SEC West rival Auburn, with the Rebels hiring Tennessee offensive coordinator David Cutcliffe as Tuberville&#x27;s replacement. 
*1999 – The Pick and the Kick: This game is best known for its dramatic ending. Down 20–6, State rallied late in the 4th to tie the game. With 20 seconds left, instead of kneeling the ball to go to overtime, the Rebels decided to run a play, deep in their own territory. Rebel quarterback Romero Miller dropped back and lobbed a deep pass which was deflected by the hands and then the foot of Mississippi State cornerback Robert Bean before being intercepted by Eugene Clinton and returned deep into Rebel territory. On the next play, with 8 seconds left, Bulldog kicker Scott Westerfield kicked a 44-yard game-winning field goal.
*2003 – Number 100: The 2003 game marked the 100th game of the heated rivalry. Ole Miss earned a share of its first SEC West division title with Eli Manning leading the team to a dominating 31-0 win. A torrential downpour prevailed much of the game. It was the Rebels first shutout win over the Bulldogs since 1971 (48–0). This Egg Bowl marked Jackie Sherrill&#x27;s final game as a football coach as in the middle of the 2003 season he had announced his retirement. Sherrill had an overall record of 7–6 against the Rebels.
*2007 – The Comeback: MSU trailed 14–0 with less than 8 minutes left to play in the fourth quarter when Ole Miss Head Coach Ed Orgeron elected to go for a fourth down at the Ole Miss 49-yard line. Rebel running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis was stopped for a loss turning the ball over on downs. The Bulldogs drove in, scored a touchdown, seized the momentum and went on to win the game 17–14. Ole Miss fired Head Coach Ed Orgeron after the Rebels finished 0–8 in the SEC.
*2008 – Croom&#x27;s Farewell: In Houston Nutt&#x27;s first Egg Bowl as the Ole Miss Head Coach, the Rebels would avenge the loss from 2007 in impressive form, utterly dominating Mississippi State in Oxford by the score of 45–0. The game featured the largest margin of defeat in any Egg Bowl game since 1971 and was the second shutout win in 5 years for Ole Miss. The game brought Ole Miss to 8–4 (5–3 in the SEC) and eventually secured them a bid to the 2009 Cotton Bowl Classic. The loss dropped MSU to 4–8 (2–6 in the SEC). MSU head coach Sylvester Croom, resigned only hours later, leaving MSU after 5 years at the helm and with a career record of 21–38.
*2009: The Rebels, fresh off an upset win over LSU, came into Starkville with an 8–3 record and a #20 ranking, while the Bulldogs had already clinched bowl ineligibility at 4–7. However, Mississippi State&#x27;s Anthony Dixon ran for 133 yards and a touchdown, backup quarterback Chris Relf ran for 131 yards a touchdown and completed two touchdown passes, and cornerback Corey Broomfield sealed the 41–27 win by returning an interception for a touchdown in the fourth quarter.
*2012: Ole Miss QB Bo Wallace threw for 294 yards and five touchdowns—including three to Donte Moncrief—as the Rebels used a huge second half to rout No. 25 MSU 41-24 on Saturday night. It was a sweet win for Ole Miss (6-6, 3-5 Southeastern Conference), which won the Egg Bowl for the first time since 2008. Ole Miss would later vacate this win due to NCAA violations.
*2013: MSU claimed a 17–10 overtime win over Ole Miss on a cold, Thanksgiving night at Davis Wade Stadium. It was the first Egg Bowl overtime game. Injured Bulldog quarterback Dak Prescott came off the bench with his team trailing 10–7 in the middle of the 4th quarter, leading MSU to a game-tying field goal that forced overtime. In overtime, Prescott scored a touchdown on fourth down from the three yard line. On the ensuing Ole Miss possession, Nickoe Whitley stripped the ball from Rebel quarterback Bo Wallace as he tried to score a game-tying touchdown. Mississippi State&#x27;s Jamerson Love recovered the ball in the endzone to seal the victory.
* 2014: The 2014 game was of particular importance due to its implications on post-season play. MSU entered the game with a 10–1 overall record, 6–1 in conference play, and a #4 ranking in the College Football Playoff poll. A win for MSU, coupled with a loss by Alabama in the Iron Bowl, would give the Bulldogs the SEC West championship and a berth in the SEC Championship Game. Ole Miss entered the game #19, marking only the fifth time in the rivalry&#x27;s history, and the first since 1999, that both teams entered the Egg Bowl ranked. For the first time since 1964, the game was televised by a national network. CBS, acknowledging the importance of the game, along with contractual limitations on how many times it can feature each team in its SEC package, passed on televising the Iron Bowl and chose to carry the Egg Bowl instead. In an upset, Ole Miss knocked off MSU 31–17. The victory was highlighted by a strong performance from Ole Miss running back Jaylen Walton who had a career-high with 148 yards rushing including a 91-yard touchdown. Ole Miss would later vacate this win due to NCAA violations.
* 2015: #18 Ole Miss raced to a 21–0 first quarter lead and never looked back in a decisive 38–27 win over #21 MSU at Davis Wade Stadium. The Rebels finished 10–3 (6–2 in the SEC) after Sugar Bowl win over Oklahoma State. MSU regrouped after the Egg Bowl to beat North Carolina State at the Belk Bowl and finished the year 9–4 (4–4 in the SEC). 
* 2016: Ole Miss and Mississippi State entered the game tied with 2-5 conference records. A home win for Ole Miss would have clinched bowl eligibility for the Rebels whereas a win for MSU would have given a 5-7 Bulldogs a chance to play in a bowl game due to the school&#x27;s Academic Progress Rate (and lack of bowl eligible teams). In a mild upset, MSU won 55-20 thanks largely to the performance of sophomore quarterback Nick Fitzgerald who rushed for a school-record 258 yards. The 35-point spread was the largest ever for the Bulldogs in Oxford. 
* 2017: Following a dislocated ankle injury for Bulldog quarterback Nick Fitzgerald early in the first quarter, the unranked Rebels built a 24–6 third quarter lead over the Bulldogs in Starkville. Despite five MSU turnovers, true freshman quarterback Keytaon Thompson would lead the Bulldogs to a unanswered 15-point rally in the fourth quarter to finish the game as a 31–28 loss for Mississippi State. 
* 2018 – The Egg Brawl: This game was notable for a brawl that occurred at the end of the third quarter. Ole Miss, trailing 28–3, appeared to score a touchdown to end the quarter. One of the MSU players continued fighting for the ball long after Ole Miss player A.J. Brown crossed the goal line with the ball. Players then started to shove each other, and eventually punches were exchanged and the benches cleared. Four players, one for Ole Miss and three for MSU, were ejected, and every player on both teams was given an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. The touchdown that Brown had appeared to score was then taken off the board due to the game clock expiring before the snap. MSU won 35–3, but would later vacate the victory due to NCAA violations.
* 2019 - The Piss and the Miss : After Elijah Moore caught a touchdown with 0:04 left in the 4th quarter to cut the lead to 21–20, he performed a touchdown celebration mimicking a dog urinating in the end zone. The ensuing 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was enforced on the extra point attempt, which kicker Luke Logan missed. The miss kept the game at 21–20, allowing the Bulldogs to run off the remaining seconds for the victory. Ole Miss fired Head Coach Matt Luke after the game.
*2022 - Leach&#x27;s Last Win: Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart threw a late touchdown with 1:25 left, capping a 99 yard drive. However, the Bulldogs stopped the following two point conversion to seal a 24-22 victory. This game would end up being the final game coached by MSU&#x27;s Mike Leach before his unexpected death.
*2023 - Road to 11 Wins: Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Caden Prieskorn early in the fourth quarter to give the Rebels (10-2, 6-2 SEC, No. 12 CFP) a 10-point lead. The win pushed the Rebels closer to an 11 win season for the first time in school history. They would complete the task by capping off the season with a 38-25 victory over No. 10 Penn State in the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium. .

<text>Glutathione &quot;S&quot;-transferases (GSTs), previously known as ligandins, are a family of eukaryotic and prokaryotic phase II metabolic isozymes best known for their ability to catalyze the conjugation of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) to xenobiotic substrates for the purpose of detoxification. The GST family consists of three superfamilies: the cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal—also known as MAPEG—proteins. Members of the GST superfamily are extremely diverse in amino acid sequence, and a large fraction of the sequences deposited in public databases are of unknown function. The Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI) is using GSTs as a model superfamily to identify new GST functions.

GSTs can constitute up to 10% of cytosolic protein in some mammalian organs. GSTs catalyse the conjugation of GSH—via a sulfhydryl group—to electrophilic centers on a wide variety of substrates in order to make the compounds more water-soluble. This activity detoxifies endogenous compounds such as peroxidised lipids and enables the breakdown of xenobiotics. GSTs may also bind toxins and function as transport proteins, which gave rise to the early term for GSTs, &quot;ligandin&quot;.

==Classification==

Protein sequence and structure are important additional classification criteria for the three superfamilies (cytosolic, mitochondrial, and MAPEG) of GSTs: while classes from the cytosolic superfamily of GSTs possess more than 40% sequence homology, those from other classes may have less than 25%. Cytosolic GSTs are divided into 13 classes based upon their structure: alpha, beta, delta, epsilon, zeta, theta, mu, nu, pi, sigma, tau, phi, and omega. Mitochondrial GSTs are in class kappa. The MAPEG superfamily of microsomal GSTs consists of subgroups designated I-IV, between which amino acid sequences share less than 20% identity. Human cytosolic GSTs belong to the alpha, zeta, theta, mu, pi, sigma, and omega classes, while six isozymes belonging to classes I, II, and IV of the MAPEG superfamily are known to exist.

===Nomenclature===
Standardized GST nomenclature first proposed in 1992 identifies the species to which the isozyme of interest belongs with a lower-case initial (e.g., &quot;h&quot; for human), which precedes the abbreviation GST. The isozyme class is subsequently identified with an upper-case letter (e.g., &quot;A&quot; for alpha), followed by an Arabic numeral representing the class subfamily (or subunit). Because both mitochondrial and cytosolic GSTs exist as dimers, and only heterodimers form between members of the same class, the second subfamily component of the enzyme dimer is denoted with a hyphen, followed by an additional Arabic numeral. Therefore, if a human glutathione &quot;S&quot;-transferase is a homodimer in the pi-class subfamily 1, its name will be written as &quot;hGSTP1-1.&quot;

The early nomenclature for GSTs referred to them as Y proteins, referring to their separation in the Y fraction (as opposed to the &quot;X and Z&quot; fractions) using Sephadex G75 chromatography. As GST sub-units were identified they were referred to as Ya, Yp, etc. with if necessary, a number identifying the monomer isoform (e.g. Yb1). Litwack &quot;et al&quot; proposed the term &quot;Ligandin&quot; to cover the proteins previously known as Y proteins.

In clinical chemistry and toxicology, the terms alpha GST, mu GST, and pi GST are most commonly used.

== Structure ==
The glutathione binding site, or &quot;G-site&quot;, is located in the thioredoxin-like domain of both cytosolic and mitochondrial GSTs. The region containing the greatest amount of variability between the assorted classes is that of helix α2, where one of three different amino acid residues interacts with the glycine residue of glutathione. Two subgroups of cytosolic GSTs have been characterized based upon their interaction with glutathione: the Y-GST group, which uses a tyrosine residue to activate glutathione, and the S/C-GST, which instead uses serine or cysteine residues.

:GST proteins are globular proteins with an &quot;N&quot;-terminal mixed helical and beta-strand domain and an all-helical &quot;C&quot;-terminal domain.

The porcine pi-class enzyme pGTSP1-1 was the first GST to have its structure determined, and it is representative of other members of the cytosolic GST superfamily, which contain a thioredoxin-like &quot;N&quot;-terminal domain as well as a &quot;C&quot;-terminal domain consisting of alpha helices.

Mammalian cytosolic GSTs are dimeric, with both subunits being from the same class of GSTs, although not necessarily identical. The monomers are approximately 25 kDa in size. They are active over a wide variety of substrates with considerable overlap. The following table lists all GST enzymes of each class known to exist in &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, as found in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database.

== Evolution ==

Environmental challenge by natural toxins helped to prepare &quot;Drosophilae&quot; for DDT challenge, by shaping the evolution of &quot;Drosophila&quot; GST - which metabolizes both.

== Function ==

The activity of GSTs is dependent upon a steady supply of GSH from the synthetic enzymes gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase, as well as the action of specific transporters to remove conjugates of GSH from the cell. The primary role of GSTs is to detoxify xenobiotics by catalyzing the nucleophilic attack by GSH on electrophilic carbon, sulfur, or nitrogen atoms of said nonpolar xenobiotic substrates, thereby preventing their interaction with crucial cellular proteins and nucleic acids. Specifically, the function of GSTs in this role is twofold: to bind both the substrate at the enzyme&#x27;s hydrophobic &quot;H&quot;-site and GSH at the adjacent, hydrophilic G-site, which together form the active site of the enzyme; and subsequently to activate the thiol group of GSH, enabling the nucleophilic attack upon the substrate. The glutathione molecule binds in a cleft between &quot;N&quot;- and &quot;C&quot;-terminal domains - the catalytically important residues are proposed to reside in the &quot;N&quot;-terminal domain. Both subunits of the GST dimer, whether hetero- or homodimeric in nature, contain a single nonsubstrate binding site, as well as a GSH-binding site. In heterodimeric GST complexes such as those formed by the cytosolic mu and alpha classes, however, the cleft between the two subunits is home to an additional high-affinity nonsubstrate xenobiotic binding site, which may account for the enzymes&#x27; ability to form heterodimers.

The compounds targeted in this manner by GSTs encompass a diverse range of environmental or otherwise exogenous toxins, including chemotherapeutic agents and other drugs, pesticides, herbicides, carcinogens, and variably-derived epoxides; indeed, GSTs are responsible for the conjugation of β1-8,9-epoxide, a reactive intermediate formed from aflatoxin B1, which is a crucial means of protection against the toxin in rodents. The detoxification reactions comprise the first four steps of mercapturic acid synthesis, with the conjugation to GSH serving to make the substrates more soluble and allowing them to be removed from the cell by transporters such as multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1). After export, the conjugation products are converted into mercapturic acids and excreted via the urine or bile.

Most mammalian isoenzymes have affinity for the substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, and spectrophotometric assays utilising this substrate are commonly used to report GST activity. However, some endogenous compounds, e.g., bilirubin, can inhibit the activity of GSTs. In mammals, GST isoforms have cell specific distributions (for example, α-GST in hepatocytes and π-GST in the biliary tract of the human liver).

GSTs have a role in the bioactivation process of clopidogrel prodrug.

==Role in cell signaling==
Although best known for their ability to conjugate xenobiotics to GSH and thereby detoxify cellular environments, GSTs are also capable of binding nonsubstrate ligands, with important cell signaling implications. Several GST isozymes from various classes have been shown to inhibit the function of a kinase involved in the MAPK pathway that regulates cell proliferation and death, preventing the kinase from carrying out its role in facilitating the signaling cascade.

Cytosolic GSTP1-1, a well-characterized isozyme of the mammalian GST family, is expressed primarily in heart, lung, and brain tissues; in fact, it is the most common GST expressed outside the liver. Based on its overexpression in a majority of human tumor cell lines and prevalence in chemotherapeutic-resistant tumors, GSTP1-1 is thought to play a role in the development of cancer and its potential resistance to drug treatment. Further evidence for this comes from the knowledge that GSTP can selectively inhibit &quot;C&quot;-Jun phosphorylation by JNK, preventing apoptosis. During times of low cellular stress, a complex forms through direct protein–protein interactions between GSTP and the &quot;C&quot;-terminus of JNK, effectively preventing the action of JNK and thus its induction of the JNK pathway. Cellular oxidative stress causes the dissociation of the complex, oligomerization of GSTP, and induction of the JNK pathway, resulting in apoptosis. The connection between GSTP inhibition of the pro-apoptotic JNK pathway and the isozyme&#x27;s overexpression in drug-resistant tumor cells may itself account for the tumor cells&#x27; ability to escape apoptosis mediated by drugs that are not substrates of GSTP.

Like GSTP, GSTM1 is involved in regulating apoptotic pathways through direct protein–protein interactions, although it acts on ASK1, which is upstream of JNK. The mechanism and result are similar to that of GSTP and JNK, in that GSTM1 sequesters ASK1 through complex formation and prevents its induction of the pro-apoptotic p38 and JNK portions of the MAPK signaling cascade. Like GSTP, GSTM1 interacts with its partner in the absence of oxidative stress, although ASK1 is also involved in heat shock response, which is likewise prevented during ASK1 sequestration. The fact that high levels of GST are associated with resistance to apoptosis induced by a range of substances, including chemotherapeutic agents, supports its putative role in MAPK signaling prevention.

===Implications in cancer development===

There is a growing body of evidence supporting the role of GST, particularly GSTP, in cancer development and chemotherapeutic resistance. The link between GSTP and cancer is most obvious in the overexpression of GSTP in many cancers, but it is also supported by the fact that the transformed phenotype of tumor cells is associated with aberrantly regulated kinase signaling pathways and cellular addiction to overexpressed proteins. That most anti-cancer drugs are poor substrates for GSTP indicates that the role of elevated GSTP in many tumor cell lines is not to detoxify the compounds, but must have another purpose; this hypothesis is also given credence by the common finding of GSTP overexpression in tumor cell lines that are not drug resistant.

==Clinical significance==

In addition to their roles in cancer development and chemotherapeutic drug resistance, GSTs are implicated in a variety of diseases by virtue of their involvement with GSH. Although the evidence is minimal for the influence of GST polymorphisms of the alpha, mu, pi, and theta classes on susceptibility to various types of cancer, numerous studies have implicated such genotypic variations in asthma, atherosclerosis, allergies, and other inflammatory diseases.

Because diabetes is a disease that involves oxidative damage, and GSH metabolism is dysfunctional in diabetic patients, GSTs may represent a potential target for diabetic drug treatment. In addition, insulin administration is known to result in increased GST gene expression through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and reduced intracellular oxidative stress, while glucagon decreases such gene expression.

Omega-class GST (GSTO) genes, in particular, are associated with neurological diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s, Parkinson&#x27;s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; again, oxidative stress is believed to be the culprit, with decreased GSTO gene expression resulting in a lowered age of onset for the diseases.

=== Release of GSTs as an indication of organ damage ===
The high intracellular concentrations of GSTs coupled with their cell-specific cellular distribution allows them to function as biomarkers for localising and monitoring injury to defined cell types. For example, hepatocytes contain high levels of alpha GST and serum alpha GST has been found to be an indicator of hepatocyte injury in transplantation, toxicity and viral infections.

Similarly, in humans, renal proximal tubular cells contain high concentrations of alpha GST, while distal tubular cells contain pi GST. This specific distribution enables the measurement of urinary GSTs to be used to quantify and localise renal tubular injury in transplantation, nephrotoxicity and ischaemic injury.

In rodent pre-clinical studies, urinary and serum alpha GST have been shown to be sensitive and specific indicators of renal proximal tubular and hepatocyte necrosis respectively.

==GST-tags and the GST pull-down assay==

GST can be added to a protein of interest to purify it from solution in a process known as a pull-down assay. This is accomplished by inserting the GST DNA coding sequence next to that which codes for the protein of interest. Thus, after transcription and translation, the GST protein and the protein of interest will be expressed together as a fusion protein. Because the GST protein has a strong binding affinity for GSH, beads coated with the compound can be added to the protein mixture; as a result, the protein of interest attached to the GST will stick to the beads, isolating the protein from the rest of those in solution. The beads are recovered and washed with free GSH to detach the protein of interest from the beads, resulting in a purified protein. This technique can be used to elucidate direct protein–protein interactions. A drawback of this assay is that the protein of interest is attached to GST, altering its native state.

A GST-tag is often used to separate and purify proteins that contain the GST-fusion protein. The tag is 220 amino acids (roughly 26 kDa) in size, which, compared to tags such as the Myc-tag or the FLAG-tag, is quite large. It can be fused to either the &quot;N&quot;-terminus or &quot;C&quot;-terminus of a protein. In addition to functioning as a purification tag, GST acts as a chaperone for the attached protein, promoting its correct folding, as well as preventing it from becoming aggregated in inclusion bodies when expressed in bacteria. The GST tag can easily be removed following purification by addition of a protease if a suitable protease-cleavage site has been inserted between the GST-tag and the protein of interest (which is usually included in many commercially available sources of GST-tagged plasmids).

<text>Hocus Pocus, or What&#x27;s the Hurry, Son? is a 1990 novel by Kurt Vonnegut.

==Plot summary==
In an editor&#x27;s note at the beginning of the book, Vonnegut claims to have found hundreds of scraps of paper of varying sizes, from wrapping paper to business cards, sequentially numbered by their author to form a narrative. The breaks between pieces of paper often signal a sort of ironic &quot;punchline&quot;.

The main character is Eugene Debs Hartke, a Vietnam War veteran and carillonneur who realizes that he has killed exactly as many people as the number of women he has had sex with. The character&#x27;s name is an homage to American labor and political leader Eugene V. Debs and anti-war senator Vance Hartke, both from Vonnegut&#x27;s home state, Indiana. Upon his discharge from the military, Hartke becomes a professor at Tarkington College in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York, but is later fired for sexual misconduct.

Hartke then becomes a teacher at a private prison in the nearby town of Athena, New York. The prison is run by a Japanese corporation and overseen by Hartke&#x27;s occasional acquaintance, Hiroshi Matsumoto. The prison is populated entirely by black inmates, America having been resegregated by both race and class. Hartke sets about teaching the inmates how to read.

After a massive prison break, the escaped inmates occupy Tarkington College and take the staff hostage. With the old prison destroyed in the breakout, Tarkington becomes a prison with Hartke as its warden. When it becomes known that the breakout was led by one of his former students, Hartke is accused of collaboration and becomes an inmate himself.

Upon completion of the riddle on the final page, Eugene&#x27;s number of sexual partners and confirmed kills is found to be 82.

==Film adaptation==
In March 2021, Uri Singer acquired the rights to adapt the novel into a film.

==Analysis==
The motif of the inhabitants of Tralfamadore influencing human history, here in a work of fiction within the story, recurs from Vonnegut&#x27;s previous work &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; (1959). The title of the fictional story is &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Tralfamadore&quot;, a reference to &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. concludes that the author of the fictional story, not named in the text, is intended to be recurring Vonnegut character Kilgore Trout. Kirkus Reviews called the presence of a brief reference to Tralfamadore &quot;standard Vonnegut&quot;.

<text>Wesley Darcel Walker (born May 26, 1955) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL) from 1977 to 1989.

==Early life==
Walker graduated from Carson High School in Carson, California, where he set many receiving and return records, and was an All-American for the California Golden Bears, catching 86 passes for 2,206 yards and 22 touchdowns over the course of four seasons, an average of 25.7 yards per catch. Walker also participated on the California Golden Bears track and field team, anchoring their 4 × 100 m relay team to a 2nd-place finish at the 1975 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships.

==Professional career==
Connie Carberg, the first female scout in NFL history was credited with helping the Jets in their selection of Walker in the second round of the 1977 NFL draft. Walker had a limited start in his first weeks as a starter, catching six total passes in his first three games, although the October 2 game against the New England Patriots saw him catch his first touchdown pass from Richard Todd. He had his biggest game against the Oakland Raiders on October 23 with a game of 178 yards on four catches with a touchdown. In total of 14 games, he caught 35 passes for 740 yards with three touchdowns. The following season saw him break out. On opening day against Miami, he caught two touchdown passes while finishing with 108 yards on four receptions in a 33–20 victory. Six weeks later, he caught five passes for 154 yards with a touchdown in his best game in yardage for the year, which saw two more 100-yard games in a full slate of sixteen games. He caught 48 passes for 1,169 yards (averaging 24.3 yards per reception) with eight touchdowns. For his efforts, he was named to the Pro Bowl. He was the first Jet to lead the league in receiving yards since Don Maynard did so in the American Football League era and is currently the last Jet to lead the category as of 2023. Walker played in just nine games in 1979, catching 23 passes for 569 yards with five touchdowns. In the ninth week against Houston, he caught four passes for 111 yards, but he suffered a knee injury on a tackle by safety Mike Reinfeldt that knocked him out for the game and ultimately the rest of the year. Walker sprained his neck in the preseason before managing to get back in time for opening day in 1980. He then missed six games with a deep thigh bruise in the middle of the season. In total, he caught 18 passes for 376 yards with one touchdown.

Walker played in 13 games for the 1981 season, catching 47 passes for 770 yards with nine touchdowns. In his first playoff game as a receiver, facing the Buffalo Bills, he caught three passes for 24 yards in the 31–27 loss. The strike-shortened 1982 season saw Walker lose no steps in nine games. He caught 39 passes for 620 yards with six touchdowns while receiving a Pro Bowl selection. He had his first three-touchdown game on December 6 in a 28–13 win over Detroit. In the Wild Card round against the Cincinnati Bengals, he caught eight passes for 145 yards for a touchdown in the 44–17 victory. He continued his ways in the Divisional Round versus Los Angeles, catching seven passes for 169 yards and a touchdown to opening the scoring in a 17–14 victory. It would not extend to the AFC Championship against Miami, where he caught one pass for zero yards in a 14–0 loss. His best receiving season came in 1983, when he had 61 receptions to go with 868 yards and eight touchdowns in a full season of play.
He played in twelve games in 1984 and caught 41 passes for 623 yards with seven touchdowns. He played the same number of games the following year and caught 34 passes for 725 yards with five touchdowns while the Jets made the playoffs. He caught four passes for 54 yards in a 26–14 loss to New England. In 1986, he appeared in each game and caught 49 passes for 1,016 yards with a career-high twelve touchdowns. Four of them (a career best in a game for Walker) came in the September 21 game against Miami, which included both the game-tying and game-winning touchdown from Ken O&#x27;Brien in a wild 51–45 victory. The Jets made the playoffs for the fourth and final time with Walker on the roster. In the Wild Card game versus Kansas City, he caught two passes for 45 yards in the 35–15 victory. In the Divisional Round game against Cleveland, he caught the first score of the game from Pat Ryan while catching one other pass in a game that the Jets lost 23–20 in double overtime. Walker played in just five games in 1987, which was marred by a strike that saw Walker and other players not cross the picket lines while replacement players were used for three weeks. He separated his shoulder early against the Seattle Seahawks and ended up missing the rest of the season, having caught nine whole passes for 190 yards and one touchdown. He played in just six games of the 1988 season due to ankle issues, catching eight passes for 89 yards, with his last catch being against Atlanta on November 26. On April 12, 1990, the Jets cut Walker, and he retired not long after that.

He was noted for his great speed, averaging over 20 yards per reception over many seasons (his career average was 19 yards per reception). Legally blind in his left eye, Walker eventually retired as an all-time leader for the Jets. He had caught 438 passes for 8,306 yards and 71 touchdowns, which was second all-time to Don Maynard in each category in Jets history (he has stayed 2nd in receptions and touchdowns as of 2024). On October 8, 2012, he was inducted into the Jets Ring of Honor alongside teammate Mark Gastineau.

==Personal life==
Walker is now a retired physical education teacher at Park View Elementary School in Kings Park, New York, and an occasional sports radio show commentator. He has two sons and a daughter. His older son, John, was a 3x All-American lacrosse player at The United States Military Academy at West Point. His younger son, Austin, played lacrosse at Johns Hopkins University. He is also the godfather of Alexandra Florant, the daughter of the track and field star Carl Florant.

Like many former NFL players, Walker has a variety of ailments as a direct result from his playing days, which he detailed in a revealing 2016 interview with &quot;Long Island Pulse Magazine&quot;. He graduated from Mercy College.

Walker was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Football Category with the Class of 2000.

<text>Rotary Connection was an American psychedelic soul band, formed in Chicago in 1966.

In addition to their own recordings, including their 1967 debut album &quot;Rotary Connection&quot;, the band backed Muddy Waters on his 1968 psychedelic blues album &quot;Electric Mud&quot;. The band&#x27;s members included Minnie Riperton, who would later emerge as a solo artist.

==Career==
===Foundation and debut album===
The highly experimental band was the idea of Marshall Chess, son of Chess Records founder Leonard Chess. Marshall was the director behind a start-up label, Cadet Concept Records, and wanted to focus on music outside of the blues and rock genres, which had made the Chess label popular. This led Marshall to turn his attention to the burgeoning psychedelic movement. He recruited Charles Stepney, a vibraphonist and classically trained arranger and producer. Marshall then recruited members of a little-known white rock band, the Proper Strangers: Bobby Simms, Mitch Aliotta, and Ken Venegas. Sidney Barnes, a songwriter within the Chess organization, also joined, as did Judy Hauff and a Chess receptionist named Minnie Riperton, who would later be successful in her own solo career. Marshall also called up prominent session musicians associated with the Chess label, including guitarist Phil Upchurch and drummer Morris Jennings. Chess described the band&#x27;s members as &quot;the hottest, most avant garde rock guys in Chicago&quot;.

The band released their self-titled debut album in late 1967. It had various styles, borrowing heavily from pop, rock, and soul, but was not radio friendly. The album also boasted an Eastern influence through its use of the sitar on the tracks &quot;Turn Me On&quot; and &quot;Memory Band&quot;. Stepney&#x27;s arrangements, brought to life by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, imbued the album with a certain dreamlike quality; this would become a trademark of both the arranger and the mouthpiece.

===&quot;Electric Mud&quot; and &quot;The Howlin&#x27; Wolf Album&quot;===
As a result of the success of &quot;The Rotary Connection&quot;, Chess felt that he could revive the career of bluesmen Muddy Waters and Howlin&#x27; Wolf, by recording two albums of experimental, psychedelic blues with members of Rotary Connection as the backing band for the singers, producing the albums &quot;Electric Mud&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Howlin&#x27; Wolf Album&quot; (1969). Chess hoped the new albums would sell well among fans of psychedelic rock bands influenced by Muddy Waters and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. In place of Muddy Waters and Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s regular musicians were Gene Barge, Pete Cosey, Roland Faulkner, Morris Jennings, Louis Satterfield, Charles Stepney and Phil Upchurch. Cosey, Upchurch and Jennings joked about calling the group &quot;The Electric Niggers&quot;. Marshall Chess liked the suggestion, but Leonard Chess refused to allow the name. Ultimately, blues purists criticized the psychedelic sound of &quot;Electric Mud&quot; and &quot;The Howlin&#x27; Wolf Album&quot;.

===Further albums, Texas International Pop Festival and disbandment ===
In 1968, Rotary Connection released their second and third albums, &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;Peace&quot;. &quot;Aladdin&quot; found Riperton assuming a more prominent vocal role than the &quot;background instrument&quot; status she had on the debut. The latter was a Christmas release, with strong messages of love and understanding for a nation in the grips of Vietnam. The album&#x27;s cover art featured a hippie Santa Claus. &quot;Peace&quot; was notable for being involved in controversy: an anti-war cartoon, in a December 1968 edition of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, featured a graphic image of a bruised and bloodied Santa on a Vietnam battlefield. Mistaking this cartoon for the album&#x27;s cover art, a drunken executive at Montgomery Ward cancelled all shipments of the album.

On August 30, 1969, the band played at the Texas International Pop Festival followed by the Palm Beach Pop Festival on November 29. Rotary Connection released three more albums: &quot;Songs&quot;, in 1969, a collection of drastic reworkings of other artists&#x27; songs, including Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;Respect&quot; and The Band&#x27;s &quot;The Weight&quot;; &quot;Dinner Music&quot; in 1970, in which they added elements of folk and country into the mix along with some electronic experimentation; and &quot;Hey, Love&quot; in 1971, a more jazz-oriented LP on which the band was billed as the New Rotary Connection. From this album came &quot;I Am the Black Gold of the Sun&quot;.

The outfit disbanded in 1974.

=== Revival ===
As part of the documentary film series &quot;The Blues&quot; (2003), produced by Martin Scorsese, members of the Rotary Connection recorded with rapper Chuck D and members of The Roots, to reflect the legacy of &quot;Electric Mud&quot; (1968).

<text>Deadeye Dick is a novel by Kurt Vonnegut originally published in 1982.

==Plot summary==
The novel&#x27;s main character, Rudy Waltz, or &quot;Deadeye Dick&quot;, commits accidental manslaughter as a child when he shoots a gun out of a window and fatally strikes a pregnant woman. Rudy was so traumatized and guilt-ridden by the incident that he lives life as an asexual &quot;neuter,&quot; neither homosexual nor heterosexual. He tells the story of his life as a middle-aged expatriate hotel manager in Haiti, which symbolizes New York City, until the end, when the stream of time of the story catches up with him. At this point, he confronts an event that has been suggested and referred to throughout the novel. The generic Midwestern town of Midland City, Ohio, in which Rudy was raised, is virtually destroyed by a neutron bomb, all the people in the town dying. At the ending of the book, it appears that Rudy, while he may not have fully come to terms with his actions, has at least come to live with them.

Another key theme throughout the book is the relationship between Waltz and his parents and brother, Felix. His father, as a young man, lived in Austria and was one of the few people who was actually friends with Adolf Hitler before his rise to power. His father is also a failed artist, who does his best to protect Rudy, to the point when he insists on going to jail just to effectively make a point. Rudy&#x27;s brother was the president of NBC, who is fired after his fourth marriage breaks up.

==Place in the Vonnegut universe==
&quot;Deadeye Dick&quot; is set mostly within fictional Midland City, Ohio, which is also the setting for one of Vonnegut&#x27;s other seminal works, &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;. Several characters, locations, or concepts from that novel are mentioned in passing or have an active role in the story (e.g. Rabo Karabekian, Dwayne and Celia Hoover, the Mildred Barry Memorial Center for the Arts, and Barrytron Ltd., amongst others).

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Deadeye Dick&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #56, and stated that &quot;The Vonnegut idiom of brief, flip, casual paragraphs lets him sneak through some shrewd blows under the lighthearted camouflage, but though often moving the technique sometimes rings hollow [...] Read the book, but warily.&quot;

<text>The Cowan rail accident occurred at 7:20pm on 6 May 1990 when the 3801 Limited special steam passenger train returning from the Morpeth Jazz Festival was struck in the rear by the following CityRail inter-urban passenger service. The steam train had stalled while attempting to climb the steep gradient from the Hawkesbury River to Cowan, New South Wales, and it was found that sand applied to the rails to regain traction had interfered with the signals and given the following train a false clear indication.

== Overview ==

The crash occurred approximately south of Brooklyn, New South Wales, near the Boronia No. 3 tunnel. The railway line at this point, known as the Cowan Bank, is 2.5% (1 in 40) grade and, as the special hauled by steam locomotive 3801 passed southwards through the No. 3 tunnel, the wheels of the locomotive started to slip. The driver of 3801 applied sand to the rails to improve traction, but the train came to a complete stop approximately 50 metres clear of the tunnel. Passengers on the steam train reported seeing a signal fluctuating aspects between green and yellow. The following CityRail V set inter-urban train, which had been halted at the northern entrance to Boronia No. 4 tunnel for 10 minutes by a red stop signal, received a green indication and proceeded, colliding with the steam train shortly after.

The impact killed the driver of the inter-urban train, Gordon Hill, and a passenger who was riding in its cab, as well as four passengers in the rear carriage of 3801&#x27;s train. The passengers killed were the recently retired Vice Chancellor of the University of Sydney, John Manning Ward, his wife and daughter, and the wife of the University&#x27;s Registrar. 99 passengers were injured, 11 of those seriously. The force of the crash completely destroyed the last carriage of the steam train, and was enough to break the locomotive coupling and push the engine 12 metres forward.

A subsequent coronial inquiry, headed by NSW State Coroner Derrick Hand, found in December 1990 that the sand that had been applied to the track by 3801 to aid traction had insulated the train from the rails, meaning that the track circuits failed to detect the presence of the first train, allowing the following inter-urban train to be given a false green (clear) aspect (known as a wrong-side failure). Mr Hand also considered it likely that a passenger on 3801 had applied a handbrake on the third carriage, and that this, combined with the heavy load, the steep grade and the curvature of the line, had prevented the steam train from restarting. No fault was found with the signalling system, although the coroner recommended that it be upgraded as soon as possible.

== Contributing factors ==

Contributing factors include:
* AC track circuits, which are less sensitive at detecting rail vehicles.
* Sand on the rails insulated the train&#x27;s wheels and prevented the track circuit from detecting it - the train effectively became invisible to the signalling system. 
* The signalling system was two-aspect colour light - a three aspect colour light may have provided the driver of the following train with more warning.
* No sand removal system fitted to 3801.
* No mechanism (at the time) for train-to-train or train-to-signalman communication (communication with signal boxes was only possible by track-side phones).
* It is believed that the handbrakes on one of the carriages may have been applied as a stunt.

== Consequences ==

* An interim ban was placed on the use of steam locomotives on the NSW railway system. The ban was lifted 9 months later.
* Operators were required to use one State Rail employee on each train
* Operators were required to carry insurance cover of $10 million. The government agreed to underwrite any claims exceeding that amount.

<doc id="1240641" wikidata="Q17125544" url="?curid=1240641" title="Lickorish–Wallace theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Lickorish–Wallace theorem in the theory of 3-manifolds states that any closed, orientable, connected 3-manifold may be obtained by performing Dehn surgery on a framed link in the 3-sphere with ±1 surgery coefficients. Furthermore, each component of the link can be assumed to be unknotted.

The theorem was proved in the early 1960s by W. B. R. Lickorish and Andrew H. Wallace, independently and by different methods. Lickorish&#x27;s proof rested on the Lickorish twist theorem, which states that any orientable automorphism of a closed orientable surface is generated by Dehn twists along 3&quot;g&quot; − 1 specific simple closed curves in the surface, where &quot;g&quot; denotes the genus of the surface. Wallace&#x27;s proof was more general and involved adding handles to the boundary of a higher-dimensional ball.

A corollary of the theorem is that every closed, orientable 3-manifold bounds a simply-connected compact 4-manifold.

By using his work on automorphisms of non-orientable surfaces, Lickorish also showed that every closed, non-orientable, connected 3-manifold is obtained by Dehn surgery on a link in the non-orientable 2-sphere bundle over the circle. Similar to the orientable case, the surgery can be done in a special way which allows the conclusion that every closed, non-orientable 3-manifold bounds a compact 4-manifold.

<text>Always Never the Same is the thirteenth studio album by American rock band Kansas, released in 1998.
This album consists of mostly covers of the band’s previous work, re-recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra. New songs include &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;The Sky Is Falling&quot;, &quot;Need to Know&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Preamble&quot;. &quot;Prelude &amp; Introduction&quot; is a medley of the Kansas songs &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;, &quot;Point of Know Return&quot;, &quot;Opus Insert&quot;, and &quot;Lamplight Symphony&quot;. The album also includes a cover of The Beatles’ &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; was also recorded during this time, in case strong sales would bring forth a second symphonic album, but was never released. This is the final Kansas album to include new songs from lead singer/keyboardist Steve Walsh.

<doc id="1240647" wikidata="Q4907744" url="?curid=1240647" title="Bilibil people">
<text>Prior to 1904, the Bilibil people lived on an island offshore from Madang, Papua New Guinea, trading clay pots along the coast from Karkar Island to western Morobe Province. The island was too small to produce enough food for the inhabitants, and the trade therefore was an essential element of their life. They moved to the mainland to their existing village site to improve their subsistence levels. They speak the Bilibil language, an Austronesian language.

==Pot making==

Bilibil women make pots, which are still produced in the traditional way. Clay for the pots is collected locally, and mixed with sand and water. The pots are hollowed out with stones and smoothed on the outside by beating with a flat board. Before they are fired, red clay is painted on the pots. This turns them a glossy red and black when they are pulled out of the fire.

The pots are put to many uses; most importantly, they are used for bride price ceremonies. Sometimes pots are still bartered for food. Inland people meet the Bilibils at a pre-arranged place, and pots are exchanged for taro and yams from the mountains. No money is used in these exchanges.

==Relationship to the ocean==
Traditionally the Bilibils have been great seamen. They built large two-masted canoes which they would use to travel hundreds of kilometres along the coast to trade with other villages. Tools for boat building were made from wood, pig&#x27;s bone, sharpened bamboo and stone. In 1978, it had been 40 years since a traditional canoe had been built by the Bilibil people, and the skills for building these boats had been almost lost. Four elderly men taught the others how to build a canoe using local trees for the hull, the outrigger and the supports. The sail was woven out of pandanus leaves, a shelter was built from bamboo with palm leaves for a roof, and a wooden cockatoo, a clan totem, was attached to the mast.

== Bilibil traditions ==
Traditional houses had roofs that came to the ground, and each clan had a men&#x27;s house which the women were not allowed to enter. Nowadays each family lives in their own house. They are made from bush materials and have large airy verandahs. The houses are about two metres off the ground; the women sit underneath and make their pots.

Most of the cooking and eating is done outside. Yams and taro are the staple diet and these are grown in large gardens behind the village. The men do the initial preparation of a new garden, but the women do most of the gardening. The yams are ready for harvest in June, and the harvest is celebrated with yam feasts. June is also the traditional new year as marked by the appearance of the Pleiades.

Young men are initiated into manhood by the older Bilibil men who take them over to Bilibil Island for about 12 days and instruct them in the way to behave as adults. When they return to the village, they are paraded through the houses and a celebration is held with feasting and dancing.

<text>, or JOLF, is a Japanese radio station based in Yurakucho, Chiyoda ward, Tokyo, headquartered near the Tokyo Imperial Palace. It is also the main company of the Nippon Broadcasting Group. Nippon Broadcasting System is a subsidiary of Fuji Media Holdings and both companies are affiliated with the Fujisankei Communications Group.

Reportedly the most listened-to radio station in the world in 1990, Nippon Broadcasting System was instrumental in the creation of several companies including Fuji Television in 1957, Pony Canyon in 1966 and the Fujisankei Communications Group in 1967. Nippon Broadcasting System is also the home of the long-running radio program &quot;All Night Nippon&quot;.

==History==

Founded in 1954, it is together with Nippon Cultural Broadcasting, the flagship station of the National Radio Network. From July 15, 1954, to September 30, 1967, the station used the abbreviation &quot;NBS&quot; derived from Nippon Broadcasting System. Since October 1, 1967, it has used the call sign JOLF and identified itself with the last two letters &quot;LF&quot;.

In 1990, Nippon Broadcasting System sued its rival Radio Nippon to prevent it from using both the &quot;R · F · Radio Japan&quot; and &quot;Radio Japan&quot; trademarks. Nippon Broadcasting System lost the lawsuit.

In 1992, Nippon Broadcasting System started broadcasting in C-QuAM stereo, continuing until March 31, 2024.

A labor union was formed at Nippon Broadcasting System for the first time in September 12, 2005.

Nippon Broadcasting System was historically the parent company of Fuji Television despite the latter being a much larger company than the former. Both companies were founded in the 1950s and were part of the Fujisankei Communications Group. In 2005, the relation between the two companies was reversed and Nippon Broadcasting System became the subsidiary of Fuji Television.

In April 2006, the radio broadcaster and its station license was spun off into a new separate company called &quot;Nippon Broadcasting System&quot; owned by Fuji Television. Fuji Television absorbed the rest of the old Nippon Broadcasting System company that was founded in 1954 and took over its assets. As a result, former subsidiaries of Nippon Broadcasting System such as Pony Canyon were transferred to Fuji Television who was later renamed Fuji Media Holdings in 2008.

<text>Joseph Anthony Manchin III ( ; born August 24, 1947) is an American businessman and retired politician who served as a United States senator from West Virginia from 2010 to 2025. He was West Virginia&#x27;s only congressional Democrat until he registered as an independent in 2024. Manchin served from 2001 to 2005 as the 27th secretary of state of West Virginia and from 2005 to 2010 as the 34th governor of West Virginia. Before entering politics, he co-founded and was president of Enersystems, his family owned and operated coal brokerage company.

Manchin won the 2004 West Virginia gubernatorial election by a large margin and was reelected by an even larger margin in 2008. He won the 2010 special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by incumbent Democrat Robert Byrd&#x27;s death with 53.5% of the vote, and in 2012 was elected to a full term with 60.6% of the vote. Manchin won a second term in 2018 with 49.6% of the vote. In all his Senate elections, he drastically outperformed Democratic presidential nominees in the state. Manchin represented the most Republican-leaning constituency of any Democrat or independent in Congress during his tenure.

Manchin has called himself a &quot;centrist, moderate, conservative Democrat&quot; and was generally regarded as the Senate Democratic caucus&#x27;s most centrist member. He opposed President Barack Obama&#x27;s energy policies, including reductions and restrictions on coal mining; voted against cloture for the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010 (not voting on the bill itself); supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s border wall and immigration policies; and voted to confirm most of Trump&#x27;s cabinet and judicial appointees, including Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. On the other hand, Manchin voted against repeated attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, voted to convict Trump in both of his impeachment trials, voted against Amy Coney Barrett&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court, voted to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, and was a Senate sponsor of the Inflation Reduction Act. He is among the more non-interventionist members of the Democratic caucus, having repeatedly called for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and opposed most military interventions in Syria.

After the 2020 elections, Manchin became a key swing vote in the Senate, which was split 50–50 between Democrats and Republicans but controlled by Democrats because Vice President Kamala Harris was the tiebreaker. Since passing legislation with only Democratic support required Manchin&#x27;s vote, he wielded a large influence in the 117th Congress. During the 118th Congress, he was again considered a key swing vote in the Senate, alongside Kyrsten Sinema. In November 2023, Manchin announced he would not run for reelection. In 2024, he left the Democratic Party to become an independent, and later clarified that he would not run for any office, ending speculation that he might be a candidate in the 2024 United States presidential election.

As of 2025, Manchin is the most recent Democrat to hold non-judicial statewide office in West Virginia. 
== Early life and education ==
Joseph Anthony Manchin III was born on August 24, 1947, in Farmington, West Virginia, a small coal mining town. He is the second of five children of Mary O. (née Gouzd) and John Manchin. The name &quot;Manchin&quot; was derived from the Italian name &quot;Mancina&quot;. His father was of Italian descent, and his paternal grandparents emigrated to the United States from the town of San Giovanni in Fiore, in Calabria. Manchin&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Czechoslovak immigrants.

Manchin&#x27;s father owned a carpet and furniture store, and his grandfather, Joseph Manchin (Giuseppe Mancina), owned a grocery store. His father and his grandfather each served as mayor of Farmington. Manchin&#x27;s uncle, A. James Manchin, was a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates and later served as West Virginia Secretary of State and Treasurer.

Manchin graduated from Farmington High School in 1965. He entered West Virginia University on a football scholarship in 1965, but an injury during practice ended his football career. Manchin graduated in 1970 with a degree in business administration and went to work for his family&#x27;s business. Manchin has been a close friend of former Alabama Crimson Tide football coach Nick Saban since childhood.

== Business interests ==

=== Enersystems coal brokerage ===
In 1988, Manchin founded Enersystems, a waste coal brokerage company based in Fairmont, West Virginia. Manchin was president of Enersystems until 2000, when he entered politics and gave control of the company&#x27;s daily operations to his son, Joe Manchin IV. At some point during his tenure as governor, Manchin moved his Enersystems holdings into a blind trust. In a financial disclosure from 2020, Manchin reported that his non-public shares of Enersystems were worth between $1 million and $5 million and that between 2011 and 2020 he was paid $5,211,154 in dividend income from them. In 2020, he received over $500,000 in dividends. Enersystems is 71% of Manchin&#x27;s investment income and 30% of his net worth.

=== Other investments ===
Since his election to the U.S. Senate in 2010, Manchin has listed AA Properties as a non-public asset on his annual financial disclosures. AA Property is reportedly 50% controlled by Manchin, and has, among other things, been an investor in Emerald Coast Realty, which owns a La Quinta hotel in Elkview, West Virginia.

== Early political career ==
Manchin was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1982 at age 35 and in 1986 was elected to the West Virginia Senate, where he served until 1996. He ran for governor in 1996, losing the Democratic primary election to Charlotte Pritt. At that time, he supported the Republican candidate for governor, Cecil Underwood, who went on to win. Manchin was elected Secretary of State of West Virginia in 2000, defeating Libertarian candidate Poochie Myers, 89.4% to 10.6%.

== Governor of West Virginia ==

In 2003, Manchin announced his intention to challenge incumbent Democratic governor Bob Wise in the 2004 Democratic primary. Wise decided not to seek reelection after a scandal, and Manchin won the Democratic primary and general election by large margins. His election marked the first time since 1964 that a West Virginia governor was succeeded by another governor from the same party.
In July 2005, Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship sued Manchin, alleging that Manchin had violated Blankenship&#x27;s First Amendment rights by threatening increased government scrutiny of his coal operations in retaliation for Blankenship&#x27;s political activities. Blankenship had donated substantial funds into campaigns to defeat a proposed pension bond amendment and oppose the reelection of state Supreme Court Justice Warren McGraw, and he fought against a proposed increase in the severance tax on extraction of mineral resources. Soon after the bond amendment&#x27;s defeat, the state Division of Environmental Protection (DEP) revoked a permit approval for controversial new silos near Marsh Fork Elementary School in Raleigh County. While area residents had complained for some time that the coal operation there endangered their children, Blankenship claimed that the DEP acted in response to his opposition to the bond amendment.

During the Sago Mine disaster in early January 2006 in Upshur County, West Virginia, Manchin confirmed incorrect reports that 12 miners had survived; in actuality only one survived. Manchin later acknowledged that a miscommunication had occurred with rescue teams in the mine. On February 1, 2006, he ordered a stop to all coal production in West Virginia pending safety checks after two more miners were killed in separate accidents. Sixteen West Virginia coal miners died in mining accidents in early 2006.

Manchin easily won reelection to a second term as governor in 2008 against Republican Russ Weeks, capturing 69.81% of the vote and winning every county.

== U.S. Senate ==
=== Elections ===

==== 2010 ====
Due to Senator Robert Byrd&#x27;s declining health, there was speculation about what Manchin would do if Byrd died. Manchin refused to comment on the subject until Byrd&#x27;s death, except to say that he would not appoint himself to the Senate. Byrd died on June 28, 2010, and Manchin appointed Carte Goodwin, his 36-year-old legal adviser, on July 16.

On July 20, 2010, Manchin announced he would seek the Senate seat in a special election for the remaining two years of Byrd&#x27;s term. In the August 28 Democratic special primary, he defeated former Democratic congressman and former West Virginia Secretary of State Ken Hechler. In the special general election, he defeated Republican businessman John Raese, 53.5%-43.4%.

==== 2012 ====

Manchin ran for reelection to a full-term in 2012. According to the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling, early polling found Manchin heavily favored, leading Representative Shelley Moore Capito 50–39, 2010 opponent John Raese 60–31, and Congressman David McKinley 57–28. Manchin did not endorse President Barack Obama for reelection in 2012, saying that he had &quot;some real differences&quot; with the presumptive nominees of both major parties. Manchin found fault with Obama&#x27;s economic and energy policies and questioned Romney&#x27;s understanding of the &quot;challenges facing ordinary people&quot;.

Manchin defeated Raese and Mountain Party candidate Bob Henry Baber, winning 61% of the vote.

==== 2018 ====

In 2018, Manchin ran for reelection. He was challenged in the Democratic primary by Paula Jean Swearengin. Swearengin is an activist and coal miner&#x27;s daughter who was supported by former members of Bernie Sanders&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign. She criticized Manchin for voting with Republicans and supporting Trump&#x27;s policies. Manchin won the primary with 70% of the vote.

On the Republican side, Manchin was challenged by West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. In August 2017, Morrisey publicly asked Manchin to resign from the Senate Democratic leadership. Manchin responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t give a shit, you understand?&quot; to a &quot;Charleston Gazette-Mail&quot; reporter. &quot;I just don&#x27;t give a shit. Don&#x27;t care if I get elected, don&#x27;t care if I get defeated, how about that?&quot;

Manchin won the November 6 general election, defeating Morrisey 49.57%-46.26%.

==== 2024 ====

Manchin has said he will not run for reelection in 2024. He indicated that he would not be leaving politics, saying he would be &quot;traveling the country and speaking out, to see if there is an interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle, and bring Americans together&quot;. In May and again in June 2023, he refused to rule out running for president as a third-party candidate instead of seeking reelection in 2024. Senators John Hickenlooper, Gary Peters, and Jon Tester publicly urged Manchin not to run for president in 2024 and to instead seek reelection.

On May 31, 2024, Manchin announced that he would leave the Democratic Party and file as an independent but would remain a member of the Senate Democratic Caucus, alongside fellow independent Senators Bernie Sanders, Angus King, and Kyrsten Sinema. By remaining in the Senate Democratic Caucus, Manchin remained chair of the Senate Energy Committee for the remainder of the 118th United States Congress. In the statement issued alongside his announcement filing as an independent, Manchin accused both the Republican and Democratic parties of &quot;partisan extremism&quot; and of &quot;leaving West Virginia behind for partisan politics&quot;. He said that to &quot;stay true to myself and remain committed to put country before party, I have decided to register as an independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America&#x27;s sensible majority&quot;. With his decision, the Senate had the most independents in a single Congress since the ratification of the 17th Amendment.

=== Tenure ===
==== Obama years (2010–2017) ====
Manchin was first sworn in to the U.S. Senate by Vice President Joe Biden on November 15, 2010, succeeding interim senator Carte Goodwin. In a 2014 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview, Manchin said his relationship with Obama was &quot;fairly nonexistent.&quot;

==== Trump years (2017–2021) ====

According to &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;, which tracks congressional votes, Manchin voted with Trump&#x27;s position 50.4% of the time during his presidency.

Manchin initially welcomed Trump&#x27;s presidency, saying, &quot;He&#x27;ll correct the trading policies, the imbalance in our trade policies, which are horrible.&quot; He supported the idea of Trump &quot;calling companies to keep them from moving factories overseas&quot;. Manchin voted for most of Trump&#x27;s cabinet nominees. He was the only Democrat to vote to confirm Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, one of two Democrats to vote to confirm Scott Pruitt as EPA Administrator, and one of three to vote to confirm Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

Manchin voted for Trump&#x27;s first two Supreme Court nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. In the former case, he was one of three Democrats (alongside Joe Donnelly and Heidi Heitkamp) to vote to confirm; in the latter case, he was the only one. He opposed the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, citing the closeness to the upcoming presidential election.

Manchin voted to convict in both Trump impeachment trials.

==== Biden years (2021–2025) ====
According to data journalism site &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;, Manchin has voted with Biden&#x27;s position 87.9% of the time as of January 2023. Because the Senate was evenly divided between Democratic and Republican members during the early portion of the Biden administration, Manchin&#x27;s ability to deny Democrats a majority made him very influential.

In January 2022, &quot;The Hill&quot; reported that Manchin &quot;spent heavily on private security&quot; during the last three months of 2021 &quot;as he became a prime target for progressive protesters angry at his role blocking a reconciliation package in the Senate&quot;. According to &quot;The Hill&quot;, &quot;climate change protesters surrounded Manchin’s car in a parking garage in early November. In October, protesters in kayaks swarmed Manchin’s yacht, parked at a Washington marina where he lives&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;a source close to Manchin told The Hill the senator and his family had been subjected to specific threats, both in Washington and in West Virginia&quot;.

On March 25, 2022, Manchin announced that he would vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.

On November 9, 2023, Manchin announced that he will not seek reelection in 2024. He said that his decision was made &quot;after months of deliberation and long conversations&quot; with his family, adding that he would instead be &quot;traveling the country and speaking out to see if there is an interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle and bring Americans together&quot;.

In early 2024, Manchin announced he was registering as independent, and later that year announced he would not run for reelection, but did not rule out running for office in the future. Manchin said his biggest regret during Biden&#x27;s presidency was voting for the American Rescue Plan, saying that it helped increased inflation.

Jim Justice won the West Virginia Senate seat Manchin vacated.

=== Funding ===
Manchin received the most funding from the oil and gas industry of any senator from May 2020 to May 2021, including $1.6 million in donations from fossil fuel PACs. He also receives funding from individuals and PACs connected to law and real estate, among others.

In June 2021, ExxonMobil lobbyist Keith McCoy said that Manchin was one of its key targets for funding and that he participated in weekly meetings with the company.

On September 30, 2021, an MSNBC news reporter asked Manchin about his opposition to the Build Back Better Act, accusing him of having a conflict of interest with provisions within the bill: &quot;Sir, the company you founded, Enersystems, provides coal to power plants that would be impacted by one of the proposals in the plan. How is that not a conflict of interest?&quot; Manchin replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve been in a blind trust for 20 years. I have no idea what they&#x27;re doing.&quot;

== Presidential politics ==
In 2023, Manchin &quot;stoked rumors about his presidential ambitions by holding a call with No Labels supporters and meeting with influential community leaders from Iowa, a state that holds outsized sway in guiding the trajectory of the presidential primaries&quot;. In May 2023, and again in June 2023, he refused to rule out running for president of the United States as a third-party candidate in 2024. Reports indicated that the centrist group No Labels was seeking to support a third-party presidential campaign and that the organization viewed Manchin as a potential candidate.

Manchin now serves as a No Labels National Co-Chair, and on July 17, 2023, he and former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman Jr. headlined a No Labels Common Sense Agenda Town Hall in Manchester, New Hampshire.

On February 15, 2024, during a City Club of Cleveland forum, he said he would pick U.S. senator Mitt Romney or former U.S. senator Rob Portman as his running mate if he ran for president.

On February 16, 2024, Manchin announced that he would not run for president.

After President Biden withdrew from the 2024 race on July 21, 2024, Manchin expressed interest in running for president at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, but opted not to, saying he would have preferred that the convention be an open contest. After Kamala Harris picked Tim Walz as her running mate, Manchin said, &quot;I can think of no one better than Governor Walz to help bring our country closer together&quot;, although he refrained from formally endorsing Harris. Manchin ultimately refused to endorse Harris, citing her call to end the filibuster in the United States Senate.

== Political positions ==

Manchin is often considered a moderate, or even conservative, Democrat. He has called himself a &quot;centrist, moderate conservative Democrat&quot; and &quot;fiscally responsible and socially compassionate.&quot; CBS News has called him &quot;a rifle-brandishing moderate&quot; who is &quot;about as centrist as a senator can get.&quot; The American Conservative Union gave him a 25% lifetime conservative rating and the progressive PAC Americans for Democratic Action gave him a 35% liberal quotient in 2016. In February 2018, a &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; study found that Manchin had voted with Trump&#x27;s position 71% of the time in Trump&#x27;s first year in office, but by the end of Trump&#x27;s presidency, Manchin had voted with the president only 50.4% of the time. Manchin voted with Biden 88.9% of the time as of September 2022. In 2013, the &quot;National Journal&quot; gave Manchin an overall score of 55% conservative and 46% liberal. In 2023, the Lugar Center ranked Manchin fourth among senators for bipartisanship.

On December 13, 2010, Manchin participated in the launch of No Labels, a nonpartisan organization &quot;committed to bringing all sides together to move the nation forward.&quot; As of September 2014, Manchin was an honorary co-chair of No Labels. In November 2014, he stepped down from his honorary post after No Labels campaigned for a Republican challenger to an incumbent Democratic senator. In 2017, Manchin once again became an honorary co-chair of No Labels.

On February 6, 2022, Manchin endorsed Senator Lisa Murkowski in her reelection campaign that year. Murkowski said she would likewise endorse him for reelection if he ran in 2024.

On November 9, 2023, Manchin announced that he would not seek reelection in 2024.

=== Abortion ===
Manchin was raised as &quot;pro-life&quot;. He has mixed ratings from both the abortion-rights and anti-abortion movements&#x27; political action groups. On August 3, 2015, he broke with Democratic leadership by voting in favor of a Republican-sponsored bill to terminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood both in the United States and globally. He has the endorsement of Democrats for Life of America, a Democratic PAC that opposes abortion.

On March 30, 2017, Manchin voted against H.J.Res. 43, which allowed states to refuse to give Title X grant money to organizations for reasons unrelated to their ability to provide the services needed. Trump signed the bill. In April 2017, Manchin endorsed the continued funding of Planned Parenthood. Also in 2017, Planned Parenthood gave him a rating of 44%. In January 2018, Manchin joined two other Democrats and most Republicans by voting for a bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks. In June 2018, upon Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy&#x27;s retirement, Manchin urged Trump not to appoint a judge who would seek to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; but to instead choose a &quot;centrist&quot;.

In 2019, Manchin was one of three Democrats to join all Republicans in voting for a bill to require that doctors care for infants born alive after a failed abortion.

In February 2022, Manchin was the only Democratic senator to vote against an abortion proposal, Women&#x27;s Health Protection Act, that would have included limiting the states&#x27; ability to restrict abortion access, among other expansions.

In May 2022, Manchin said that he would again vote against his party&#x27;s bill, the Women&#x27;s Health Protection Act, which included codifying federal abortion rights as the Supreme Court appeared poised to overturn &quot;Roe&quot;. Manchin said the bill went too far and that he would support a narrower measure that still included codifying &quot;Roe&quot;. He was the only Senate Democrat to oppose the legislation.

=== Appeals to join the Republican Party ===
Before his Senate swearing-in in 2010, rumors suggested that the Republican Party was courting Manchin to change parties. Republicans later suggested that Manchin was the source of the rumors. Republicans attempted to convince him to switch parties in 2014 after they took control of the Senate. He rejected their overtures. As the 2016 elections approached, reports speculated that Manchin would become a Republican if the Senate were in a 50–50 tie, but he later said he would remain a Democrat at least as long as he remained in the Senate. In 2018, Manchin said that he became and remained a Democrat because everyone that he knew growing up in Farmington, West Virginia was a Democrat during the New Deal era.

In 2021, during the time Manchin opposed the Biden-supported Build Back Better bill, several Republicans urged Manchin to join the Republican Party. During appearances on Fox News, Republicans Mitch McConnell, Jim Justice, Jeff Van Drew, Bill Hagerty, and Tom Cotton each suggested that Manchin join their party. Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn also said that they had attempted to convince Manchin to do so.

In 2022, Donald Trump wrote in a Truth Social post: &quot;The fact is, Joe Manchin should have been brought into the Republican Party long ago&quot;.

=== Broadband ===
In December 2018, after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced a pause on the funding program for wireless broadband during its conduct of an investigation, Manchin announced his intent to hold the renomination of Brendan Carr in protest of the move. Manchin lifted his hold the following week after the FCC promised that it would make funding for wireless broadband in rural areas a priority.

In August 2019, Manchin sent FCC Chairman Ajit Pai eight letters that contained results from speed tests across West Virginia as part of an effort to highlight incorrect broadband coverage maps in the state.

=== D.C. and Puerto Rico statehood ===
In a November 10, 2020, interview, Manchin said that he did not &quot;see the need for the D.C. statehood with the type of services that we&#x27;re getting in D.C. right now&quot; and that he was &quot;not convinced that&#x27;s the way to go.&quot; Of Puerto Rico statehood, Manchin said that he opposed it but was open to discussion. In a January 10, 2021 interview, he did not affirm his opposition to statehood for D.C. or Puerto Rico, saying only, &quot;I don&#x27;t know enough about that yet. I want to see the pros and cons. So I&#x27;m waiting to see all the facts&quot;. On April 30, 2021, Manchin came out against the D.C. Statehood bill that had passed the House of Representatives, suggesting that D.C. could instead be given statehood by constitutional amendment.

=== Disaster relief ===
In May 2019, Manchin and John Cornyn introduced the Disaster Recovery Funding Act, a bill that would direct the Office of Management and Budget to release $16 billion for disaster relief funding within 60 days to nine states and two U.S. Territories. Manchin said that West Virginia had been awaiting funding for rebuilding for three years since a series of floods in June 2016. The bill died in committee.

In August 2019, Manchin announced $106 million in disaster relief funding for West Virginia.

=== Education ===
In February 2019, Manchin said the collapse of an omnibus education reform proposal resulted from state lawmakers not laying the groundwork for broad support for the proposal. Manchin said, &quot;You don&#x27;t do major reform, policy changes, for the whole education system in a 60-day session without public hearings. There should have been a whole year of going out and speaking to the public.&quot; He stated his support for homeschooling and private schools as well as his opposition to funding &quot;them with public dollars.&quot;

=== Energy and environment ===

Manchin sits on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and supports a comprehensive, &quot;all-of-the-above&quot; energy approach that includes coal.

Manchin&#x27;s first bill in the Senate dealt with what he called the EPA&#x27;s overreach. After the EPA vetoed a previously approved permit for the Spruce Mine in Logan County, West Virginia, he offered the EPA Fair Play Act, which would &quot;clarify and confirm the authority of the Environment Protection Agency to deny or restrict the use of defined areas as disposal sites for the discharge of dredged or filled material&quot;. Manchin said the bill would prevent the EPA from &quot;changing its rules on businesses after permits have already been granted.&quot;

Environmentalists have criticized Manchin for his family ties to the coal industry. He served as president of Energysystems in the late 1990s before becoming active in politics. On his financial disclosures in 2009 and 2010, his reported earnings from the company were $1,363,916 and $417,255, respectively. Critics have said his opposition to health regulations that would raise industry expenses is due to his stake in the industry; West Virginia&#x27;s Sierra Club chapter chair Jim Sconyers said, &quot;he&#x27;s been nothing but a mouthpiece for the coal industry his whole public life.&quot; Opinions on the subject are mixed; &quot;The Charleston Gazette&quot; wrote, &quot;the prospect that Manchin&#x27;s $1.7 million-plus in recent Enersystems earnings might tilt him even more strongly pro-coal might seem remote, given the deep economic and cultural connections that the industry maintains in West Virginia.&quot;

Manchin supports building the Keystone XL Pipeline from Canada. He has said, &quot;It makes so much common sense that you want to buy oil off your friends and not your enemies.&quot; The pipeline would span over 2,000 miles across the United States.

In 2011, Manchin was the only Democratic senator to support the Energy Tax Prevention Act, which sought to prohibit the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas. In 2012, Manchin supported a failed GOP effort to &quot;scuttle Environmental Protection Agency regulations that mandate cuts in mercury pollution and other toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants&quot;, while West Virginia&#x27;s other senator, Jay Rockefeller, did not.

In December 2014, Manchin was one of six Democratic senators to sign a letter to the EPA urging it to give states more time to comply with its rule on power plants and calling for an elimination of the 2020 targets in the final rule.

Manchin criticized President Barack Obama&#x27;s environmental regulations as a &quot;war on coal&quot; and demanded what he called a proper balance between the needs of the environment and the coal business. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that while professing environmental concerns, he has consistently stood up for coal, adding, &quot;no one is going to stop using fossil fuels for a long time.&quot; Manchin &quot;does not deny the existence of man-made climate change&quot;, the &quot;Times&quot; wrote, but &quot;is reluctant to curtail it.&quot; In February 2017, he was one of two Democratic senators to vote to confirm Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

In June 2017, Manchin supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, saying he supported &quot;a cleaner energy future&quot; but that the Paris deal failed to strike &quot;a balance between our environment and the economy.&quot;

In April 2019, Manchin was one of three Democratic senators who voted with Republicans to confirm David Bernhardt, an oil executive, as Secretary of the Interior.

In February 2019, after Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called for a vote on the Green New Deal in order to get Democratic members of the Senate on record regarding the legislation, Manchin expressed opposition to the plan:

In 2021, Manchin opposed the &quot;Clean Electricity Performance Program&quot; in a budget reconciliation bill, leading to its removal from that bill.

In October 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; named Manchin one of the United States&#x27; top &quot;climate villains&quot;, writing that he &quot;uses his position to hold climate legislation hostage on behalf of the fossil fuel industry&quot;.

In December 2024, Manchin revealed that he supported the Inflation Reduction Act only after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, because of the 2021-2023 global energy crisis.

=== Federal budget ===
Manchin has co-sponsored balanced budget amendments put forth by Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), Richard Shelby (R-AL), and Mark Udall (D-CO). He has also voted against raising the federal debt ceiling.

Manchin has expressed strong opposition to entitlement reform, describing Mitch McConnell&#x27;s comments in October 2018 on the need to reform entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare as &quot;absolutely ridiculous.&quot; In January 2019, Manchin supported both Republican and Democratic bills to end a government shutdown. He was the only Democrat to break from his party and vote in favor of the Republican proposal.

On August 1, 2019, the Senate passed a bipartisan budget deal that raised spending over current levels by $320 billion and lifted the debt ceiling for the following two years in addition to forming a course for funding the government without the perceived fiscal brinkmanship of recent years. Manchin joined Tom Carper and Republicans Mitt Romney and Rick Scott in issuing a statement asserting that &quot;as former Governors, we were responsible for setting a budget each year that was fiscally responsible to fund our priorities. That&#x27;s why today, we, as U.S. Senators, cannot bring ourselves to vote for this budget deal that does not put our country on a fiscally sustainable path.&quot;

=== Foreign policy ===
Manchin is critical of American military intervention overseas, particularly in Afghanistan and Syria. He has repeatedly demanded the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and has opposed most military intervention in Syria.

On June 21, 2011, Manchin delivered a speech on the Senate floor calling for a &quot;substantial and responsible reduction in the United States&#x27; military presence in Afghanistan.&quot; He said, &quot;We can no longer afford to rebuild Afghanistan and America. We must choose. And I choose America.&quot; Manchin&#x27;s remarks were criticized by Senator John McCain (R-AZ) as &quot;at least uninformed about history and strategy and the challenges we face from radical Islamic extremism.&quot; Manchin made similar remarks in a press conference on January 7, 2014, arguing that &quot;all of the money and all of the military might in the world will not change that part of the world.&quot; He said that by the end of the year, the American troops in that country should be at Bagram Airfield alone. After the deaths of three American soldiers in Afghanistan in November 2018, Manchin renewed his calls for the withdraw of American troops from the country, saying that both presidents Obama and Trump had expressed support for taking troops out of the country but had not done so. &quot;They all seem to have the rhetoric, and no one seems to have the follow-up. It&#x27;s time to come out of there,&quot; he said.

Manchin introduced legislation to reduce the use of overseas service and security contractors. He successfully amended the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act to cap contractors&#x27; taxpayer-funded salaries at $230,000.

Following the Ghouta chemical attack in August 2013 during the Syrian Civil War, Manchin said, &quot;There is no doubt that an attack occurred and there is no doubt it was produced under the Assad regime. It&#x27;s not clear cut if Assad gave the order himself. It has not been proven.&quot; He opposed any strikes on the Syrian Government in retaliation for the attacks. Instead, he introduced a joint resolution with Senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) requesting that President Obama come up with a long-term strategy on Syria and work diplomatically to ensure the destruction of Syria&#x27;s chemical weapons. On September 16, 2014, Manchin announced that he would vote against a possible Senate resolution to arm Syrian opposition fighters. &quot;At the end of the day, most of the arms that we give to people are used against us. Most of the people we train turn against us,&quot; he said. He referred to plans calling for ground troops in Syria, which had been proposed by some Republican senators, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as &quot;insanity,&quot; but supported the 2017 Shayrat missile strike launched by order of President Trump in response to a chemical weapons attack allegedly perpetrated by the Syrian Government. Manchin said that &quot;yesterday&#x27;s strike was important to send a message to the Syrian regime and their Russian enablers that these horrific actions will not be tolerated.&quot;

In April 2017, Manchin was one of eight Democratic senators to sign a letter to President Trump noting government-subsidized Chinese steel had been placed into the American market in recent years below cost and had hurt the domestic steel industry and the iron ore industry that fed it, calling on Trump to raise the steel issue with President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China Xi Jinping in his meeting with him.

In April 2017, following a North Korea senior official declaring that the U.S. had created &quot;a dangerous situation in which a thermonuclear war may break out at any minute,&quot; Manchin stated that North Korea had &quot;to understand that we will retaliate&quot; and that he did not believe the U.S. would not respond if North Korea continued to play &quot;their games.&quot; In May 2018, Manchin accused Kim Jong-un of accelerating &quot;the nuclear threat&quot; of North Korea in a manner that would enable him to receive concessions and that Kim Jong-un was &quot;in a serious, serious problem with his country and the people in his country&quot; without China.

In June 2017, Manchin was one of five Democrats who, by voting against a Senate resolution disapproving of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, ensured its failure. Potential primary opponent Paula Jean Swearengin charged that because of Manchin&#x27;s vote, weapons sold to the Saudis &quot;could possibly end up in the hands of terrorists.&quot;

In June 2017, Manchin co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

In July 2017, Manchin urged Trump to block the sale of the Chicago Stock Exchange to Chinese investors, arguing that China&#x27;s &quot;rejection of fundamental free-market norms and property rights of private citizens makes me strongly doubt whether an Exchange operating under the direct control of a Chinese entity can be trusted to &#x27;self-regulate&#x27; now and in the future.&quot; He also expressed concern &quot;that the challenges plaguing the Chinese market—lack of transparency, currency manipulation, etc.—will bleed into the Chicago Stock Exchange and adversely impact financial markets across the country.&quot;

In November 2017, in response to efforts by China to purchase tech companies based in the U.S., Manchin was one of nine senators to cosponsor a bill that would broaden the federal government&#x27;s ability to prevent foreign purchases of U.S. firms by increasing the strength of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The scope of the CFIUS would be expanded to allow it to review and possibly decline smaller investments, and add national security factors for CFIUS to consider, including whether information about Americans would be exposed as part of transactions or whether a deal would facilitate fraud.

In November 2017, after the West Virginia Commerce Department announced an agreement with China Energy to invest $83.7 billion in shale gas development and chemical manufacturing projects in West Virginia after state Commerce Secretary Woody Thrasher and China Energy President Ling Wen signed a memorandum of understanding, Manchin said that he was thrilled with the signing and that he was satisfied that China Energy recognized West Virginians as the hardest-working people in the world.

In March 2018, Manchin blamed China for Trump&#x27;s imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, noting that the U.S. was the largest importer of steel while 50% of steel was produced in China, and that he believed that prices would increase as a result of the tariffs.

In 2019, Manchin and Republican Marco Rubio drafted a Middle East policy bill with provisions that rebuked President Trump over withdrawals of troops from Syria and Afghanistan and a measure authorizing state and municipal governments to punish companies after they oppose Israel via boycott, divestment or sanctions. The measure also reauthorized at least $3.3 billion for Israel&#x27;s military financing in addition to extending Jordan&#x27;s security aid, granting new sanctions on individuals giving their support to the Syrian government and ordering the Treasury Department to determine whether the Central Bank of Syria was money laundering. The bill passed in the Senate in a 77 to 23 vote in February 2019.

On January 8, 2019, Manchin was one of four Democrats to vote to advance a bill imposing sanctions against the Syrian government and furthering U.S. support for Israel and Jordan as Democratic members of the chamber employed tactics to end the United States federal government shutdown of 2018–2019. In April 2019, he endorsed Republican senator Susan Collins in her 2020 reelection campaign.

In May 2019, Manchin cosponsored the South China Sea and East China Sea Sanctions Act, a bipartisan bill reintroduced by Marco Rubio and Ben Cardin that was intended to disrupt China&#x27;s consolidation or expansion of its claims of jurisdiction over both the sea and air space in disputed zones in the South China Sea.

In October 2019, Manchin was one of six senators to sign a bipartisan letter to Trump calling on him to &quot;urge Turkey to end their offensive and find a way to a peaceful resolution while supporting our Kurdish partners to ensure regional stability&quot; and arguing that to leave Syria without installing protections for American allies would endanger both them and the US.

In March 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Manchin and Murkowski led the drafting of the Ban Russian Energy Imports Act. The act would declare a national emergency pursuant to existing law and ban most fossil fuel imports from Russia for the war&#x27;s duration. At introduction it was sponsored by 18 senators, a mixture of Republicans, Democrats, and independents.

=== Guns ===
In 2012, Manchin&#x27;s candidacy was endorsed by the National Rifle Association (NRA), which gave him an &quot;A&quot; rating. Following the Sandy Hook shooting, Manchin partnered with Republican senator Pat Toomey to introduce a bill that would have strengthened background checks on gun sales. The Manchin-Toomey bill was defeated on April 17, 2013, by a vote of 54–46; 60 votes would have been required to pass it. Despite the fact that the bill did not pass, the NRA targeted Manchin in an attack ad.

Manchin was criticized in 2013 for agreeing to an interview with &quot;The Journal&quot; in Martinsburg, West Virginia, but demanding that he not be asked any questions about gun control or the Second Amendment.

In 2016, referring to the difficulty of keeping guns out of the hands of potential terrorists in the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub shooting, Manchin said, &quot;due process is what&#x27;s killing us right now.&quot; This comment drew the criticism of both the NRA and the Cato Institute, which accused Manchin of attacking a fundamental constitutional principle. &quot;With all respect,&quot; commented Ilya Shapiro of Cato, &quot;due process is the essential basis of America.&quot;

In October 2017, following the Las Vegas shooting, Manchin stated that it was &quot;going to take President Trump, who looks at something from a law-abiding gun owner&#x27;s standpoint, that makes common sense and gun sense&quot; for progress to be made on gun legislation and that he would not rule out reviving the Manchin-Toomey bill if the legislation attracted enough Republican cosponsors.

In a March 2018 interview, a month after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and shortly before the March For Our Lives demonstrations, Manchin stated that the Manchin-Toomey bill should serve as the base for a new gun control law and that Trump expressing support for background checks would set his legacy and &quot;give Republicans enough cover to support this in the most reasonable, responsible way.&quot;

In August 2019, following two more mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, Manchin said that Trump had &quot;a golden opportunity to start making America safe again by starting with this basic building block of background checks.&quot; Manchin also noted his disagreement with the position of House Minority Whip Steve Scalise that existing gun background check measures were sufficient, adding that even though he was &quot;a law-abiding gun owner,&quot; he would not sell a gun through a gun show or online to someone whose history he was unsure of. On September 5 of that year, Manchin and Trump met in the White House for a discussion on gun-control legislation. According to a White House official, Trump told Manchin of his &quot;interest in getting a result&quot; so dialogue could resume &quot;to see if there&#x27;s a way to create a reasonable background check proposal, along with other ideas.&quot;

=== Health care ===
In 2010, Manchin called for &quot;repairs&quot; of the Affordable Care Act and repeal of the &quot;bad parts of Obamacare.&quot; On January 14, 2017, Manchin expressed concern at the strict party-line vote on repealing Obamacare and said he could not, in good conscience, vote to repeal without a new plan in place. He added, however, that he was willing to work with Trump and the GOP to formulate a replacement. In June 2017, Manchin and Bob Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania warned that repealing Obamacare would worsen the opioid crisis. In July 2017, he said that he was one of about ten senators from both parties who had been &quot;working together behind the scenes&quot; to formulate a new health-care program, but that there was otherwise insufficient bipartisanship on the issue.

In September 2017, Manchin released a statement expressing that he was skeptical of a single-payer health care system being &quot;the right solution&quot; while noting his support for the Senate considering &quot;all of the options through regular order so that we can fully understand the impacts of these ideas on both our people and our economy.&quot;

During 2016–2017, Manchin read to the Senate several letters from constituents about loved ones&#x27; deaths from opioids and urged his colleagues to act to prevent more deaths. Manchin took &quot;an unusual proposal&quot; to President Trump to address the crisis and called for a &quot;war on drugs&quot; that involves not punishment but treatment. He proposed the LifeBOAT Act, which would fund treatment. He also opposes marijuana legalization. In January 2018, Manchin was one of six Democrats who broke with their party to vote to confirm Trump&#x27;s nominee for Health Secretary, Alex Azar.

In his 2018 reelection campaign, Manchin emphasized his support for Obamacare, running an ad where he criticized a lawsuit that sought to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

In January 2019, Manchin was one of six Democratic senators to introduce the American Miners Act of 2019, a bill that would amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to swap funds in excess of the amounts needed to meet existing obligations under the Abandoned Mine Land fund to the 1974 Pension Plan as part of an effort to prevent its insolvency as a result of coal company bankruptcies and the 2008 financial crisis. It also increased the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund tax and ensured that miners affected by the 2018 coal company bankruptcies would not lose their health care.

In a May 2019 letter to Attorney General William Barr, Manchin and Republican Susan Collins wrote that the Affordable Care Act &quot;is quite simply the law of the land, and it is the Administration&#x27;s and your Department&#x27;s duty to defend it&quot; and asserted that Congress could &quot;work together to fix legislatively the parts of the law that aren&#x27;t working&quot; without letting the position of a federal court &quot;stand and devastate millions of seniors, young adults, women, children and working families.&quot;

=== Immigration ===
Manchin is opposed to the DREAM Act, and was absent from a 2010 vote on the bill. He supports construction of a wall along the southern border of the United States. He opposed the Obama administration&#x27;s lawsuit against Arizona over that state&#x27;s immigration enforcement law. Manchin voted against the McCain-Coons proposal to create a pathway to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants without funding for a border wall and he voted against a comprehensive immigration bill proposed by Susan Collins which gave a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers as well as funding for border security.

Manchin voted to withhold funding for &quot;sanctuary cities&quot; and in support of President Trump&#x27;s proposal to give a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, build a border wall, and reduce legal immigration. On June 18, 2018, he came out against the Trump administration family separation policy. In September 2019, Manchin was the only Democrat on the Senate Appropriations panel to vote for a $71 billion homeland security measure that granted Trump the $5 billion he had previously requested to build roughly 200 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border.

=== Infrastructure ===

In response to a leaked story that the Biden administration would pursue a $3 trillion infrastructure package, Manchin appeared to support the spending, calling for an &quot;enormous&quot; infrastructure bill. He also expressed openness to paying for the bill by raising taxes on corporations and wealthy people, despite the fact that this would likely eliminate any possible bipartisan support.

In December 2021, Manchin signaled that he was not likely to vote for the Biden-supported Build Back Better Act, saying, &quot;I cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve tried everything humanly possible. I can&#x27;t get there.&quot; Manchin named growing inflation, the national debt, and the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as reasons for opposition. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki responded that Manchin&#x27;s comments &quot;represent a sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position, and a breach of his commitments to the president and the senator&#x27;s colleagues in the House and Senate&quot;. The United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), which represents West Virginia coal miners and endorsed Manchin in the 2018 United States Senate election in West Virginia, urged him to revisit his opposition; the UMWA noted that the bill included an extension of a fund providing benefits to coal miners with black lung disease as well as tax incentives for manufacturers to build facilities in coalfields, which would employ thousands of out-of-work miners.

Also in December 2021, Manchin expressed displeasure with the tactics Democrats used to pressure him into supporting the Build Back Better Act. In an interview with &quot;Politico&quot;, he said, &quot;They figure, &#x27;surely to God we can move one person. Surely, we can badger and beat one person up.&#x27; Well, guess what? I’m from West Virginia. I’m not from where they’re from, [where] they can just beat the living crap out of people and think they’ll be submissive... I just got to the wit’s end... It’s not the president, it’s the staff. They drove some things and they put some things out that were absolutely inexcusable”.

Continued negotiations between Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer eventually resulted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which incorporated some of the Build Back Better Act&#x27;s climate change, healthcare, and tax reform proposals while excluding its social safety net proposals. Manchin expressed his support for the Inflation Reduction Act on July 27, 2022. On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act on a 51–50 vote, with Manchin voting in favor and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking a tie. On August 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the Act into law.

In February 2023, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that Manchin was &quot;livid&quot; over how the Biden administration was implementing the Inflation Reduction Act. He was especially concerned about &quot;a delay in new guidelines on who gets the law’s generous electric vehicle tax credits&quot;.

In July 2024, Manchin and John Barrasso introduced S. 4753, the Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024, aiming to speed the permitting process for energy infrastructure and mineral development. The bill would affect both fossil fuel and electric power transmission projects.

=== LGBT rights ===
On December 9, 2010, Manchin was the sole Democrat to vote against cloture for the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act, which contained a provision to repeal Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell. In an interview with the Associated Press, Manchin cited the advice of retired military chaplains as a basis for his decision to vote against repeal. He also indicated he wanted more time to &quot;hear the full range of viewpoints from the citizens of West Virginia.&quot; A day later, he was publicly criticized at a gay rights rally for his position on the bill. On July 26, 2017, he voiced opposition to Trump&#x27;s proposed ban on transgender service in the United States military.

As of 2015, Manchin was the only member of the Senate Democratic Caucus to oppose same-sex marriage. On February 14, 2018, he cosponsored S.515, a bill that would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify that all provisions shall apply to legally married same-sex couples in the same manner as other married couples. As of March 18, 2019, he is the only member of the Senate Democratic Caucus who is not a cosponsor of the Equality Act. He has said that he believes &quot;no one should be afraid of losing their job or losing their housing because of their sexual orientation&quot; but does not believe the current version of the Equality Act &quot;provides sufficient guidance to the local officials who will be responsible for implementing it.&quot; In November 2022, Manchin reversed his prior position and voted to advance and pass legislation, the Respect for Marriage Act, which protects same-sex marriages under federal law.

In March 2021, Manchin was the only Democrat to vote for a failed amendment to rescind funding from public schools that allow transgender youth to participate in the sporting teams of their gender identity.

The Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT rights group in America, gave Manchin a score of 48% in the 116th Congress. He received a score of 30% in the 115th Congress, 85% in the 114th Congress, and 65% in the 113th Congress.

=== Drugs ===
In June 2011, Manchin joined Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) in seeking a crackdown on Bitcoin currency transactions, saying that they facilitated illegal drug trade transactions. &quot;The transactions leave no traditional bank transfer money trail for investigators to follow, and leave it hard to prove a package recipient knew in advance what was in a shipment,&quot; using an &quot;&#x27;anonymizing network&#x27; known as Tor.&quot; One opinion website said the senators wanted &quot;to disrupt the Silk Road drug website.&quot;

In May 2012, in an effort to reduce prescription drug abuse, Manchin successfully proposed an amendment to the Food and Drug Administration reauthorization bill to reclassify hydrocodone as a Schedule II controlled substance.

In 2018, Manchin secured a provision in the Opioid Crisis Response Act that ensured additional opioid funding for West Virginia after the bill had previously granted funding based on states&#x27; overall opioid overdose death counts as opposed to the overdose death rate. Manchin stated that the bill before his intervention was &quot;basically using a blanket before when giving money&quot; and added that the bill was incentivizing &quot;companies to do the research to produce a product that gives the same relief as the opioid does, but is not (addictive).&quot; The bill passed in the Senate in September.
In April 2019, Manchin cosponsored the Protecting Jessica Grubb&#x27;s Legacy Act, legislation that authorized medical records of patients being treated for substance use disorder being shared among healthcare providers in case the patient provided the information. Cosponsor Shelley Moore Capito stated that the bill also prevented medical providers from unintentionally providing opioids to individuals in recovery.

In May 2019, when Manchin and Capito announced $600,000 of funding for West Virginia through the Rural Communities Opioid Response Program of the Department of Health and Human Services&#x27; Health Resources and Services Administration, Manchin stated that the opioid epidemic had devastated every community in West Virginia and that as a senator &quot;fighting against this horrible epidemic and helping fellow West Virginians have always been my top priorities.&quot;

In July 2019, Manchin issued a release in which he called for a $1.4 billion settlement from Reckitt Benckiser Group to be used for both programs and resources that would address the opioid epidemic.

=== Senior citizens ===
To help locate missing senior citizens, Manchin introduced the Silver Alert Act in July 2011 to create a nationwide network for locating missing adults and senior citizens modeled after the AMBER Alert. Manchin also sponsored the National Yellow Dot Act to create a voluntary program that would alert emergency services personnel responding to car accidents of the availability of personal and medical information on the car&#x27;s owner.

Manchin said in 2014 that he &quot;would change Social Security completely. I would do it on an inflationary basis, as far as paying into payroll taxes, and change that, to keep us stabilized as far as cash flow. I&#x27;d do COLAs—I&#x27;d talk about COLA for 250 percent of poverty guidelines.&quot; Asked whether this meant he would &quot;cut benefits to old people,&quot; Manchin said that &quot;a rich old person... won&#x27;t get the COLAs.&quot; He asked: &quot;Do you want chained CPI? I can live with either one.&quot;

=== Economics ===
In 2018, Manchin was one of 17 Democrats to break with their party and vote with Republicans to ease the Dodd-Frank banking rules.

Manchin opposed Trump&#x27;s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He called it &quot;a closed process&quot; that &quot;makes little impact in the paychecks of the people in his state.&quot; At the same time, he posited the bill contains &quot;some good things... Initially people will benefit,&quot; although ultimately voting against it. In turn, NRSC spokesman Bob Salera stated that he had &quot;turned his back and voted with Washington Democrats.&quot;

Manchin opposed the January 2018 government shutdown. &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that he helped end the shutdown by threatening not to run for reelection unless his fellow Democrats ended it.

In March 2019, Manchin was a cosponsor of a bipartisan bill to undo a drafting error in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that mandated stores and restaurants to have to write off the costs of renovations over the course of 39 years via authorizing businesses to immediately deduct the entirety of costs of renovations.

On February 2, 2021, Manchin announced his opposition to an increase from $7.25 to $15 per hour in the federal minimum wage, but said he was open to a smaller increase, perhaps to $11, and higher for parts of the country with a higher cost of living, like Massachusetts, New York, and California. He also argued that the minimum wage should be index-linked, saying, &quot;Once it gets above $11 it should be indexed, so it never becomes a political football again.&quot; Along with seven other Democrats, Manchin opposed a $15 minimum wage proposal by Bernie Sanders as part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and forced Democrats to limit extended unemployment benefits in the same bill.

=== Veterans ===
In February 2017, Manchin and Roy Blunt introduced the HIRE Veterans Act, which establishes a tiered recognition program within the Department of Labor to award employers based on their contributions to veteran employment. The legislation passed in April 2017.

In January 2019, Manchin was one of five senators to cosponsor the VA Provider Accountability Act, a bipartisan bill meant to amend Title 38 of the United States Code to authorize the under secretary of health to report &quot;major adverse personnel actions&quot; related to certain health care employees at the National Practitioner Data Bank along with applicable state licensing boards.

In July 2019, Manchin and Republican Marsha Blackburn introduced the Providing Veterans Access to In-State Tuition Act, a bill that would remove a three-year post-discharge requirement and thereby enable student veterans eligibility to receive in-state tuition rates from public schools in the event they decide to use their Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits.

In August 2019, Manchin and Capito announced a collection of grants that totaled to over $7 million intended to aid homeless veterans under the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs&#x27; (VA) Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) Program.

=== Voting rights ===
On June 6, 2021, in an op-ed published in the &quot;Charleston Gazette-Mail&quot;, Manchin expressed his opposition to the For the People Act due to its lack of bipartisan support. But he has expressed his support for a reinforced version of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and urged its passage in the Senate. Shortly thereafter, several Democratic lawmakers accused Manchin of supporting Jim Crow laws by opposing the For the People Act, a signature piece of legislation of the Democratic majority, aiming to expand voting rights, among other provisions.

The bill has universal Republican opposition, and so would require the filibuster to be eliminated in order to pass. Manchin defended his opposition to it, saying, &quot;I think there&#x27;s a lot of great things in that piece of legislation, but there&#x27;s an awful lot of things that basically don&#x27;t pertain directly to voting.&quot; In the op-ed, he also elaborated on his view of eliminating the filibuster: &quot;I cannot explain strictly partisan election reform or blowing up the Senate rules to expedite one party&#x27;s agenda.&quot;

== Legacy ==
From 2021 until he became an Independent in 2024, Manchin was the only Democrat holding congressional or statewide partisan office in West Virginia. Although Democrats have not won West Virginia in a presidential election since 1996, or even a single county in the state since 2012, Manchin held his U.S. Senate seat from 2010 to 2025. 

In September 2018, GQ called Manchin &quot;the last Democrat in Trump country.&quot; In October 2021, Richard Luscombe wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Manchin was a Democrat in name only because he opposed Biden&#x27;s Build Back Better Act. In November 2023, the &quot;Associated Press&quot; called Manchin &quot;the last in a line of formidable West Virginia Democrats who promoted coal interests&quot;, in line with Manchin&#x27;s predecessors such as Robert Byrd, Jay Rockefeller, and Jennings Randolph.

Senator Jon Tester said, &quot;Manchin is going to be remembered as somebody who has been difficult to work with, but got a lot of things done&quot;. Tester unsuccessfully tried to persuade Manchin to change the Senate filibuster. Journalist Burgess Everett said Manchin&#x27;s &quot;name is now synonymous with any single member of Congress who&#x27;s willing to hold up an entire party&#x27;s agenda&quot;.

After Kamala Harris lost the 2024 United States presidential election to Donald Trump, Manchin criticized many of the Democratic Party&#x27;s positions and said that its brand was &quot;toxic.&quot; Manchin said he will remain an independent and had no plans to run for political office in the future.

== Personal life ==
Manchin is a member of the National Rifle Association and a licensed pilot. He married Gayle Heather Conelly on August 5, 1967. Together they have three children: Heather Manchin Bresch, Joseph IV, and Brooke.

Manchin is Catholic.

In 2006 and 2010, Manchin delivered commencement addresses at Wheeling Jesuit University and at Davis &amp; Elkins College, receiving honorary degrees from both institutions.

In December 2012, Manchin voiced his displeasure with MTV&#x27;s new reality show &quot;Buckwild&quot;, which was set in his home state&#x27;s capital of Charleston. He asked the network&#x27;s president to cancel the show, contending that it depicted West Virginia in a negative, unrealistic fashion. The show ended after its first season.

In a lawsuit filed in July 2014, John Manchin II, one of Manchin&#x27;s brothers, sued Manchin and his other brother, Roch Manchin, over a $1.7 million loan. The lawsuit alleged that Joe and Roch Manchin borrowed the money to keep the doors open at the family-owned carpet business run by Roch, that no part of the loan had yet been repaid, and that the defendants had taken other measures to evade compensating John Manchin II for non-payment. John Manchin II withdrew the suit on June 30, 2015.

As of 2018, according to OpenSecrets.org, Manchin&#x27;s net worth was more than $7.6 million.

As of 2022, Manchin lived on a yacht in the Potomac River when in Washington, and his net worth was estimated to be $12 million.

<text>The New Jersey Junction Railroad (NJJ) was part of the New York Central Railroad and ran along the Hudson River in Hudson County, New Jersey, from the West Shore Railroad (NYCRR) yards at Weehawken Terminal south to Jersey City. It later owned an extension to the north, separated by the Weehawken yard from the original line.

What would become part of the NJJ was the Hoboken and Hudson River Turnpike, chartered in 1857 to build a road from the north of Hoboken to Bull&#x27;s Ferry near the Bergen County line. The New York and Bull&#x27;s Ferry Railroad was chartered in 1861, and renamed the New York and Fort Lee Railroad the year after. This railroad had been projected by the Erie Railroad as a much larger line, stretching from Hoboken to the New York state line along the Hudson River. The first two miles of this projected road, built on part of the Hoboken and Hudson River Railroad from Jersey City to the north side of Hoboken, opened in 1870, and was controlled by the Erie from the outset. The connection to the Long Dock Tunnel was made by way of the Morris and Essex Railroad; when they abandoned their line in favour of using the Bergen Tunnels, the Fort Lee assumed control of the connection to the tunnel. By the end of its life, the road reached the Township of Union. 

With the opening of the Weehawken Tunnel by the NYCRR in 1884, the NYCRR began to expand their reach through Hudson County. The NJJ was incorporated under the laws of New Jersey on February 27, 1886. The New York and Fort Lee was leased to the New Jersey Junction Railroad on June 30, 1886. With the exception of the connection to the Long Dock Tunnel (which would become the Docks Connecting Railway), most of its trackage was transferred to the NJJ, though south of Weehawken the NJJ constructed new trackage parallel to the existing line to allow the Erie to reach its Weehawken yards under lease. On July 1, 1886, the NJJ was leased for 100 years to the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. The full line south to the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s lines in Jersey City opened for freight in May 1887 and passengers in June 1887.

The NJJ owned the entire stock of the New Jersey Shore Line Railroad, Jersey City and Bayonne Railroad, and State Line and Stony Point Railroad; only the former constructed track, subsuming what remained of the Hudson River Turnpike. On October 24, 1914, the NJJ was reorganized as a merger with the New Jersey Shore Line Railroad.

In 1952, the New York Central Railroad officially subsumed the New Jersey Junction Railroad, which it had controlled since its beginning. The line eventually passed under control of CSX and Norfolk Southern as their River Line and Weehawken Branch. The southern section is now being used for New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, from North Bergen south to Hoboken, with freight now running along the former Northern Railroad of New Jersey on the other side of the New Jersey Palisades.

<doc id="1240661" wikidata="Q2050200" url="?curid=1240661" title="S-Curve Records">
<text>S-Curve Records is an American record label founded in 2000 by former Mercury Records executive Steve Greenberg. It is based in New York City. In 2001 the label established a distribution and licensing agreement with EMI Records. Among the hits released by S-Curve between 2000 and 2004 were &quot;Who Let the Dogs Out?&quot; by Baha Men, &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot; by Fountains of Wayne and Joss Stone&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;the Soul Sessions&quot; and &quot;Mind Body &amp; Soul&quot;. All of these artists received multiple Grammy nominations, with Baha Men winning the &quot;Best Dance Recording&quot; Grammy in 2001.

In 2007 Greenberg relaunched the label after a two-year hiatus, during which he served as President of Columbia Records. In 2010, the label&#x27;s distribution deal with EMI came to an end and S-Curve entered into a new U.S. distribution deal, with Universal Music Group. From 2012 to 2015, Warner Music Group distributed the label outside of North America.

The S-Curve roster and catalog include titles by Andy Grammer, JJ Rosa, Leslie Odom Jr., We the Kings, Yola, Rwandan star Bruce Melodie, Bay Ledges, Daisy the Great, Netta Barzilai, Rachel Crow, Maxi Priest, Michael Blume, Hailey Knox, Duran Duran, Betty Wright, Fountains of Wayne, Baha Men, The Beu Sisters, Sarah Hudson, Tom Jones, Little Jackie, Diane Birch, Nikki Jean, David Broza, Joshua Henry, Conkarah, Rozzi Crane, A Great Big World, Swamp Dogg, Night Bus, A-WA, Care Bears on Fire, Sinking Ships, Tinted Windows and Joss Stone.

S-Curve&#x27;s 2011 release by Betty Wright and the Roots, &quot;Betty Wright: The Movie&quot; was nominated for a Grammy in the &quot;Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance&quot; category. Andy Grammer&#x27;s debut album has yielded the hit singles &quot;Keep Your Head Up&quot; (certified Platinum in the U.S.) &quot;Miss Me&quot; and &quot;Fine By Me&quot; (certified Gold). His follow-up album, &quot;Magazines or Novels&quot;, contained the triple-platinum selling single &quot;Honey, I&#x27;m Good&quot; and the gold-certified &quot;Good to Be Alive (Hallelujah)&quot;. Grammar&#x27;s 2016 release &quot;Fresh Eyes&quot; has been certified Platinum in the US, Canada, and Australia. In July 2012, S-Curve released Joss Stone&#x27;s &quot;the Soul Sessions Vol. II&quot;, a sequel to her 2003 debut album, produced by Greenberg, who also produced Stone&#x27;s first two albums during the label&#x27;s initial incarnation. That album achieved Top 10 statues on both the Billboard 200 album chart and the UK Albums Chart. AJR has earned five platinum singles on the S-Curve label, they are no longer on the label. Maxi Priest was nominated for a 2021 Grammy in the &quot;Best Reggae Album&quot; category for his S-Curve release &quot;It All Comes Back To Love.&quot;

Besides releasing music, S-Curve&#x27;s business interests include music publishing and the company&#x27;s equity stakes in online media companies Vydia, Eko (formerly Interlude), YouNow, Stationhead, Selectable Media (formerly Nabbr), Hyperactivate (creators of Hashtag Art) and Soomla. In 2011 and 2012, music videos released by S-Curve using Eko&#x27;s interactive video technology won MTV &quot;O Music Awards&quot; for &quot;Most Innovative Video&quot;: Grammer&#x27;s &quot;Keep Your Head Up&quot; and We the Kings&#x27;s &quot;Say You Like Me.&quot;

The record label and publishing company were acquired by BMG Rights Management in November 2015, with Greenberg continuing at the helm. S-Curve continues to independently own stakes in its portfolio of tech companies.

In 2021, the label relaunched in a partnership with Disney Music Group. As of 2024, the label entered into a distribution deal with Sony Music&#x27;s The Orchard. S-Curve&#x27;s back catalog remains with BMG.

<text>In physics, a parity transformation (also called parity inversion) is the flip in the sign of &quot;one&quot; spatial coordinate. In three dimensions, it can also refer to the simultaneous flip in the sign of all three spatial coordinates (a point reflection):

formula_1

It can also be thought of as a test for chirality of a physical phenomenon, in that a parity inversion transforms a phenomenon into its mirror image.

All fundamental interactions of elementary particles, with the exception of the weak interaction, are symmetric under parity transformation. As established by the Wu experiment conducted at the US National Bureau of Standards by Chinese-American scientist Chien-Shiung Wu, the weak interaction is chiral and thus provides a means for probing chirality in physics. In her experiment, Wu took advantage of the controlling role of weak interactions in radioactive decay of atomic isotopes to establish the chirality of the weak force. 

By contrast, in interactions that are symmetric under parity, such as electromagnetism in atomic and molecular physics, parity serves as a powerful controlling principle underlying quantum transitions.

A matrix representation of P (in any number of dimensions) has determinant equal to −1, and hence is distinct from a rotation, which has a determinant equal to 1. In a two-dimensional plane, a simultaneous flip of all coordinates in sign is &quot;not&quot; a parity transformation; it is the same as a 180° rotation.

In quantum mechanics, wave functions that are unchanged by a parity transformation are described as even functions, while those that change sign under a parity transformation are odd functions.

==Simple symmetry relations==
Under rotations, classical geometrical objects can be classified into scalars, vectors, and tensors of higher rank. In classical physics, physical configurations need to transform under representations of every symmetry group.

Quantum theory predicts that states in a Hilbert space do not need to transform under representations of the group of rotations, but only under projective representations. The word &quot;projective&quot; refers to the fact that if one projects out the phase of each state, where we recall that the overall phase of a quantum state is not observable, then a projective representation reduces to an ordinary representation. All representations are also projective representations, but the converse is not true, therefore the projective representation condition on quantum states is weaker than the representation condition on classical states.

The projective representations of any group are isomorphic to the ordinary representations of a central extension of the group. For example, projective representations of the 3-dimensional rotation group, which is the special orthogonal group SO(3), are ordinary representations of the special unitary group SU(2). Projective representations of the rotation group that are not representations are called spinors and so quantum states may transform not only as tensors but also as spinors.

If one adds to this a classification by parity, these can be extended, for example, into notions of
*&quot;scalars&quot; () and &quot;pseudoscalars&quot; () which are rotationally invariant.
*&quot;vectors&quot; () and &quot;axial vectors&quot; (also called &quot;pseudovectors&quot;) () which both transform as vectors under rotation.

One can define reflections such as

formula_2

which also have negative determinant and form a valid parity transformation. Then, combining them with rotations (or successively performing &quot;x&quot;-, &quot;y&quot;-, and &quot;z&quot;-reflections) one can recover the particular parity transformation defined earlier. The first parity transformation given does not work in an even number of dimensions, though, because it results in a positive determinant. In even dimensions only the latter example of a parity transformation (or any reflection of an odd number of coordinates) can be used.

Parity forms the abelian group formula_3 due to the relation formula_4. All Abelian groups have only one-dimensional irreducible representations. For formula_3, there are two irreducible representations: one is even under parity, formula_6, the other is odd, formula_7. These are useful in quantum mechanics. However, as is elaborated below, in quantum mechanics states need not transform under actual representations of parity but only under projective representations and so in principle a parity transformation may rotate a state by any phase.

=== Representations of O(3) ===
An alternative way to write the above classification of scalars, pseudoscalars, vectors and pseudovectors is in terms of the representation space that each object transforms in. This can be given in terms of the group homomorphism formula_8 which defines the representation. For a matrix formula_9
* scalars: formula_10, the trivial representation
* pseudoscalars: formula_11
* vectors: formula_12, the fundamental representation
* pseudovectors: formula_13
When the representation is restricted to formula_14, scalars and pseudoscalars transform identically, as do vectors and pseudovectors.

==Classical mechanics==
Newton&#x27;s equation of motion formula_15 (if the mass is constant) equates two vectors, and hence is invariant under parity. The law of gravity also involves only vectors and is also, therefore, invariant under parity.

However, angular momentum formula_16 is an axial vector,
formula_17

In classical electrodynamics, the charge density formula_8 is a scalar, the electric field, formula_19, and current formula_20 are vectors, but the magnetic field, formula_21 is an axial vector. However, Maxwell&#x27;s equations are invariant under parity because the curl of an axial vector is a vector.

==Effect of spatial inversion on some variables of classical physics==
The two major divisions of classical physical variables have either even or odd parity. The way into which particular variables and vectors sort out into either category depends on whether the &quot;number of dimensions&quot; of space is either an odd or even number. The categories of &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;even&quot; given below for the &quot;parity transformation&quot; is a different, but intimately related issue.

The answers given below are correct for 3 spatial dimensions. In a 2 dimensional space, for example, when constrained to remain on the surface of a planet, some of the variables switch sides.

===Odd===
Classical variables whose signs flip when inverted in space inversion are predominantly vectors. They include:

===Even===
Classical variables, predominantly scalar quantities, which do not change upon spatial inversion include:

==Quantum mechanics==

===Possible eigenvalues===

In quantum mechanics, spacetime transformations act on quantum states. The parity transformation, formula_22, is a unitary operator, in general acting on a state formula_23 as follows: formula_24.

One must then have formula_25, since an overall phase is unobservable. The operator formula_26, which reverses the parity of a state twice, leaves the spacetime invariant, and so is an internal symmetry which rotates its eigenstates by phases formula_27. If formula_26 is an element formula_29 of a continuous U(1) symmetry group of phase rotations, then formula_30 is part of this U(1) and so is also a symmetry. In particular, we can define formula_31, which is also a symmetry, and so we can choose to call formula_32 our parity operator, instead of formula_22. Note that formula_34 and so formula_32 has eigenvalues formula_36. Wave functions with eigenvalue formula_37 under a parity transformation are even functions, while eigenvalue formula_38 corresponds to odd functions. However, when no such symmetry group exists, it may be that all parity transformations have some eigenvalues which are phases other than formula_36.

For electronic wavefunctions, even states are usually indicated by a subscript g for &quot;gerade&quot; (German: even) and odd states by a subscript u for &quot;ungerade&quot; (German: odd). For example, the lowest energy level of the hydrogen molecule ion (H2+) is labelled formula_40 and the next-closest (higher) energy level is labelled formula_41.

The wave functions of a particle moving into an external potential, which is centrosymmetric (potential energy invariant with respect to a space inversion, symmetric to the origin), either remain invariable or change signs: these two possible states are called the even state or odd state of the wave functions.

The law of conservation of parity of particles states that, if an isolated ensemble of particles has a definite parity, then the parity remains invariable in the process of ensemble evolution. However this is not true for the beta decay of nuclei, because the weak nuclear interaction violates parity.

The parity of the states of a particle moving in a spherically symmetric external field is determined by the angular momentum, and the particle state is defined by three quantum numbers: total energy, angular momentum and the projection of angular momentum.

===Consequences of parity symmetry===

When parity generates the Abelian group formula_3, one can always take linear combinations of quantum states such that they are either even or odd under parity (see the figure). Thus the parity of such states is ±1. The parity of a multiparticle state is the product of the parities of each state; in other words parity is a multiplicative quantum number.

In quantum mechanics, Hamiltonians are invariant (symmetric) under a parity transformation if formula_43 commutes with the Hamiltonian. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, this happens for any scalar potential, i.e., formula_44, hence the potential is spherically symmetric. The following facts can be easily proven:
*If formula_45 and formula_46 have the same parity, then formula_47 where formula_48 is the position operator.
*For a state formula_49 of orbital angular momentum formula_50 with z-axis projection formula_51, then formula_52.
*If formula_53, then atomic dipole transitions only occur between states of opposite parity.
*If formula_54, then a non-degenerate eigenstate of formula_55 is also an eigenstate of the parity operator; i.e., a non-degenerate eigenfunction of formula_55 is either invariant to formula_43 or is changed in sign by formula_43.

Some of the non-degenerate eigenfunctions of formula_55 are unaffected (invariant) by parity formula_43 and the others are merely reversed in sign when the Hamiltonian operator and the parity operator commute:
formula_61

where formula_62 is a constant, the eigenvalue of formula_43,
formula_64

==Many-particle systems: atoms, molecules, nuclei==

The overall parity of a many-particle system is the product of the parities of the one-particle states. It is −1 if an odd number of particles are in odd-parity states, and +1 otherwise. Different notations are in use to denote the parity of nuclei, atoms, and molecules.

===Atoms===
Atomic orbitals have parity (−1)&quot;ℓ&quot;, where the exponent ℓ is the azimuthal quantum number. The parity is odd for orbitals p, f, ... with ℓ = 1, 3, ..., and an atomic state has odd parity if an odd number of electrons occupy these orbitals. For example, the ground state of the nitrogen atom has the electron configuration 1s22s22p3, and is identified by the term symbol 4So, where the superscript o denotes odd parity. However the third excited term at about 83,300 cm−1 above the ground state has electron configuration 1s22s22p23s has even parity since there are only two 2p electrons, and its term symbol is 4P (without an o superscript).

===Molecules===
The complete (rotational-vibrational-electronic-nuclear spin) electromagnetic Hamiltonian of any molecule commutes with (or is invariant to) the parity operation P (or E*, in the notation introduced by Longuet-Higgins) and its eigenvalues can be given the parity symmetry label + or - as they are even or odd, respectively. The parity operation involves the inversion of electronic and nuclear spatial coordinates at the molecular center of mass.

Centrosymmetric molecules at equilibrium have a centre of symmetry at their midpoint (the nuclear center of mass). This includes all homonuclear diatomic molecules as well as certain symmetric molecules such as ethylene, benzene, xenon tetrafluoride and sulphur hexafluoride. For centrosymmetric molecules, the point group contains the operation i which is not to be confused with the parity operation. The operation i involves the inversion of the electronic and vibrational displacement coordinates at the nuclear centre of mass. For centrosymmetric molecules the operation i commutes with the rovibronic (rotation-vibration-electronic) Hamiltonian and can be used to label such states. Electronic and vibrational states of centrosymmetric molecules are either unchanged by the operation i, or they are changed in sign by i. The former are denoted by the subscript g and are called gerade, while the latter are denoted by the subscript u and are called ungerade. The complete electromagnetic Hamiltonian of a centrosymmetric molecule
does not commute with the point group inversion operation i because of the effect of the nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian. The nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian can mix the rotational levels of g and u vibronic states (called &quot;ortho-para&quot; mixing) and give rise to &quot;ortho&quot;-&quot;para&quot; transitions

===Nuclei===
In atomic nuclei, the state of each nucleon (proton or neutron) has even or odd parity, and nucleon configurations can be predicted using the nuclear shell model. As for electrons in atoms, the nucleon state has odd overall parity if and only if the number of nucleons in odd-parity states is odd. The parity is usually written as a + (even) or − (odd) following the nuclear spin value. For example, the isotopes of oxygen include 17O(5/2+), meaning that the spin is 5/2 and the parity is even. The shell model explains this because the first 16 nucleons are paired so that each pair has spin zero and even parity, and the last nucleon is in the 1d5/2 shell, which has even parity since ℓ = 2 for a d orbital.

==Quantum field theory==

If one can show that the vacuum state is invariant under parity, formula_65, the Hamiltonian is parity invariant formula_66 and the quantization conditions remain unchanged under parity, then it follows that every state has good parity, and this parity is conserved in any reaction.

To show that quantum electrodynamics is invariant under parity, we have to prove that the action is invariant and the quantization is also invariant. For simplicity we will assume that canonical quantization is used; the vacuum state is then invariant under parity by construction. The invariance of the action follows from the classical invariance of Maxwell&#x27;s equations. The invariance of the canonical quantization procedure can be worked out, and turns out to depend on the transformation of the annihilation operator:
formula_67
where formula_68 denotes the momentum of a photon and formula_69 refers to its polarization state. This is equivalent to the statement that the photon has odd intrinsic parity. Similarly all vector bosons can be shown to have odd intrinsic parity, and all axial-vectors to have even intrinsic parity.

A straightforward extension of these arguments to scalar field theories shows that scalars have even parity. That is, formula_70, since
formula_71
This is true even for a complex scalar field. (Details of spinors are dealt with in the article on the Dirac equation, where it is shown that fermions and antifermions have opposite intrinsic parity.)

With fermions, there is a slight complication because there is more than one spin group.

==Parity in the Standard Model==

===Fixing the global symmetries===
Applying the parity operator twice leaves the coordinates unchanged, meaning that must act as one of the internal symmetries of the theory, at most changing the phase of a state. For example, the Standard Model has three global U(1) symmetries with charges equal to the baryon number , the lepton number , and the electric charge . Therefore, the parity operator satisfies for some choice of , , and . This operator is also not unique in that a new parity operator can always be constructed by multiplying it by an internal symmetry such as for some .

To see if the parity operator can always be defined to satisfy , consider the general case when for some internal symmetry present in the theory. The desired parity operator would be . If is part of a continuous symmetry group then exists, but if it is part of a discrete symmetry then this element need not exist and such a redefinition may not be possible.

The Standard Model exhibits a symmetry, where is the fermion number operator counting how many fermions are in a state. Since all particles in the Standard Model satisfy , the discrete symmetry is also part of the continuous symmetry group. If the parity operator satisfied , then it can be redefined to give a new parity operator satisfying . But if the Standard Model is extended by incorporating Majorana neutrinos, which have and , then the discrete symmetry is no longer part of the continuous symmetry group and the desired redefinition of the parity operator cannot be performed. Instead it satisfies so the Majorana neutrinos would have intrinsic parities of .
===Parity of the pion===
In 1954, a paper by William Chinowsky and Jack Steinberger demonstrated that the pion has negative parity.
They studied the decay of an &quot;atom&quot; made from a deuteron () and a negatively charged pion () in a state with zero orbital angular momentum formula_72 into two neutrons (formula_73).

Neutrons are fermions and so obey Fermi–Dirac statistics, which implies that the final state is antisymmetric. Using the fact that the deuteron has spin one and the pion spin zero together with the antisymmetry of the final state they concluded that the two neutrons must have orbital angular momentum formula_74 The total parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the particles and the extrinsic parity of the spherical harmonic function formula_75 Since the orbital momentum changes from zero to one in this process, if the process is to conserve the total parity then the products of the intrinsic parities of the initial and final particles must have opposite sign. A deuteron nucleus is made from a proton and a neutron, and so using the aforementioned convention that protons and neutrons have intrinsic parities equal to formula_76 they argued that the parity of the pion is equal to minus the product of the parities of the two neutrons divided by that of the proton and neutron in the deuteron, explicitly formula_77 from which they concluded that the pion is a pseudoscalar particle.

===Parity violation===


Although parity is conserved in electromagnetism and gravity, it is violated in weak interactions, and perhaps, to some degree, in strong interactions. The Standard Model incorporates parity violation by expressing the weak interaction as a chiral gauge interaction. Only the left-handed components of particles and right-handed components of antiparticles participate in charged weak interactions in the Standard Model. This implies that parity is not a symmetry of our universe, unless a hidden mirror sector exists in which parity is violated in the opposite way.

An obscure 1928 experiment, undertaken by R. T. Cox, G. C. McIlwraith, and B. Kurrelmeyer, had in effect reported parity violation in weak decays, but, since the appropriate concepts had not yet been developed, those results had no impact. In 1929, Hermann Weyl explored, without any evidence, the existence of a two-component massless particle of spin one-half. This idea was rejected by Pauli, because it implied parity violation.

By the mid-20th century, it had been suggested by several scientists that parity might not be conserved (in different contexts), but without solid evidence these suggestions were not considered important. Then, in 1956, a careful review and analysis by theoretical physicists Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang went further, showing that while parity conservation had been verified in decays by the strong or electromagnetic interactions, it was untested in the weak interaction. They proposed several possible direct experimental tests. They were mostly ignored, but Lee was able to convince his Columbia colleague Chien-Shiung Wu to try it. She needed special cryogenic facilities and expertise, so the experiment was done at the National Bureau of Standards.

Wu, Ambler, Hayward, Hoppes, and Hudson (1957) found a clear violation of parity conservation in the beta decay of cobalt-60. As the experiment was winding down, with double-checking in progress, Wu informed Lee and Yang of their positive results, and saying the results need further examination, she asked them not to publicize the results first. However, Lee revealed the results to his Columbia colleagues on 4 January 1957 at a &quot;Friday lunch&quot; gathering of the Physics Department of Columbia. Three of them, R. L. Garwin, L. M. Lederman, and R. M. Weinrich, modified an existing cyclotron experiment, and immediately verified the parity violation. They delayed publication of their results until after Wu&#x27;s group was ready, and the two papers appeared back-to-back in the same physics journal.

The discovery of parity violation explained the outstanding puzzle in the physics of kaons.

In 2010, it was reported that physicists working with the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider had created a short-lived parity symmetry-breaking bubble in quark–gluon plasmas. An experiment conducted by several physicists in the STAR collaboration, suggested that parity may also be violated in the strong interaction. It is predicted that this local parity violation manifests itself by chiral magnetic effect.

===Intrinsic parity of hadrons===
To every particle one can assign an intrinsic parity as long as nature preserves parity. Although weak interactions do not, one can still assign a parity to any hadron by examining the strong interaction reaction that produces it, or through decays not involving the weak interaction, such as rho meson decay to pions.

This followed the launch of the first stereo broadcasting line on April 1, 1980. TOKYO FM serves as the key station. The council’s secretariat is located in the JFN Center Building at 1-8 Koji-cho, Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo, near the headquarters of TOKYO FM, with many member bureaus’ Tokyo branch offices also situated in the building.

==List of affiliates==
Stations are listed in Japanese order of prefectures which is mirrored in ISO 3166-2:JP.
=== FMQ League ===

FMQ League () is a group of radio stations mostly comprising JFN affiliates in the region of Kyūshū; FM Okinawa is not a part of this group, but FMQ League is joined by FM Yamaguchi from Chūgoku region. FM Fukuoka serves as the chief station.

===Areas without a JFN station===
The prefectures the JFN is yet to have a presence are Chiba, Ibaraki, Kanagawa, Kyoto, Nara, Saitama, Wakayama and Yamanashi. Ibaraki had no assigned frequency, the local frequency was used by NHK FM in 1992.

==== Frequency assigned, but yet to be launched ====
* Nara - 85.8 MHz
* Wakayama - 77.2 MHz

<doc id="1240680" wikidata="Q1422396" url="?curid=1240680" title="Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)">
<text>The Treaty of Madrid (also known as the Treaty of Limits of the Conquests) was an agreement concluded between Spain and Portugal on 13 January 1750. In an effort to end decades of conflict in the region of present-day Uruguay, the treaty established detailed territorial boundaries between Portuguese Brazil and the Spanish colonial territories to the south and west. Portugal also recognized Spain&#x27;s claim to the Philippines while Spain acceded to the westward expansion of Brazil. The treaty included a mutual guarantee of support in case either state&#x27;s American colonies were attacked by a third power. 

Most notably, Spain and Portugal expressly abandoned the papal bull, &quot;Inter caetera&quot;, and the treaties of Tordesillas and Zaragoza as the legal basis for colonial division.

:&quot;See also Spanish–Portuguese War (1735–1737)&quot;
Earlier treaties, such as the Treaty of Tordesillas and the Treaty of Zaragoza, drawn up by both countries and mediated by Pope Alexander VI, stipulated that the Portuguese empire in South America could extend no further west than 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands (called the Tordesillas meridian, approximately the 46th meridian). Had those treaties remained unchanged, the Spanish would have held both what is today the city of São Paulo and all land to the west and south. Thus, Brazil would be only a fraction of its present-day size.

Gold was discovered in Mato Grosso in 1695. Starting in the 17th century, Portuguese explorers, traders, and missionaries from the state of Maranhao in the north, and gold-seekers and slave-hunters (the famous of São Paulo} in the south, had penetrated far to the west and south-west of the old treaty line, also looking for slaves.

New captaincies (administrative divisions) created by the Portuguese beyond Brazil&#x27;s previously-established boundaries: Minas Gerais, Goias, Mato Grosso, and Santa Catarina.

==National motivations==
===Portugal===
The Portuguese wanted to strike a balance between the boundary claims of Spain and Portugal by allotting the greater part of the Amazon basin to themselves and that of the Rio de la Plata to Spain. They also sought to secure the undisputed sovereignty of the gold and diamond districts of Goiás and Mato Grosso for the Portuguese Crown, as well as to secure Brazil&#x27;s frontier by the retention of the Rio Grande do Sul and the acquisition of the Spanish Jesuit missions (&quot;Seven Peoples&quot;) on the left bank of the Uruguay River. They hoped that the meeting would allow them to secure the western frontier of Brazil and river communication with Maranhão-Pará by ensuring that navigation on the rivers Tocantins, Tapajos and Madeira remained in Portuguese hands.

===Spain===
Spain wanted to stop the westward advance of the Portuguese, who had already encroached on much of what was theoretically Spanish territory, even though it consisted mostly of virgin jungle. They also sought to transfer to Spain the Portuguese colony of Sacramento, which had functioned as a back door for the illegal Anglo-Portuguese trade with the Viceroyalty of Peru, and which rendered the Spanish city of Buenos Aires dangerously exposed to foreign invasion. Furthermore, they hoped to undermine the Anglo-Portuguese alliance, and thus eventually facilitate a Spanish-Portuguese alliance against British aggression and ambition in South America.

==International context==
The Philippines and Moluccas were under Spanish sovereignty.

==Structure==
The original treaty was in both Portuguese and Spanish, and consists of a lengthy preamble and 26 articles.

==Terms==
The Treaty of Madrid was based on the principles of &quot;Uti possidetis, ita possideatis&quot; from Roman law (&quot;who owns by fact owns by right&quot;) and &quot;natural boundaries&quot;, stating respectively in the preamble: &quot;each party must stay with what it now holds&quot; and &quot;the boundaries of the two Domains... are the sources and courses of the most notable rivers and mountains&quot;, and thereby authorizing the Portuguese to retain the lands they had occupied at the expense of the Empire of Spain. The treaty also stipulated that Spain would receive the Sacramento Colony and Portugal the Misiones Orientales. They were seven independent Jesuit missions of the upper Uruguay River. The Treaty of Tordesillas was specifically abrogated.

The treaty sensibly sought to follow geographic features in fixing the boundary: it moved westward from a point on the Atlantic coast south of Rio Grande do Sul, then northward irregularly following parts of the Uruguay, Iguaçu, Paraná, Paraguay, Guapore, Madeira, and Javari Rivers, and north of the Amazon, ran from the middle Negro to the watershed between the Amazon and Orinoco basins and along the Guiana watershed to the Atlantic.

Soon after the signing of the treaty, two commissions for demarcation were created. The northern one was chaired by the State Governor of Grão-Pará and Maranhão, and the southern one by the Portuguese Governor of Rio de Janeiro.

==Aftermath==
The Treaty of Madrid was significant because it substantially defined the modern boundaries of Brazil. However, the resistance of the Jesuits to surrendering their missions, and the refusal of the Guaraní to be forcibly relocated, led to the nullification of the treaty by the subsequent Treaty of El Pardo, signed by both countries in 1761.

The opposition by the Guaraní led to the Guaraní War of 1756. There were frequent skirmishes in the Banda Oriental after the 1750 treaty. The terms of the Treaty of Madrid, with a few exceptions, were re-established in the First Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1777, and that treaty was again negated in 1801.

<text>The Percy V. Pennybacker Jr. Bridge in Austin, Texas, is a through-arch bridge across Lake Austin which connects the northern and southern sections of the Loop 360 highway, also known as the &quot;Capital of Texas Highway&quot;. Due to its arched weathering-steel bridge and the rolling hills on its northern side, this structure is regarded as a scenic route in Texas.

In 2001, 48,000 vehicles crossed the bridge daily. Ten years prior to this, 22,000 vehicles had crossed the bridge daily.

== Specifications ==
The bridge is constructed such that no part of the structure touches the water below. The bridge is long with a central arched span. This design keeps Lake Austin free from support columns because the recreational lake (really a dammed stretch of the Colorado River) is popular with boaters and waterskiers. The untied arch suspension span is suspended by 72 steel cables. At the time of its construction, it was only the second bridge of its design in the world.

The bridge has four lanes, two in each direction, separated by a middle barrier wall. The bridge also has a bike and pedestrian lane. The bike access on the bridge is one reason for Loop 360&#x27;s popularity with cyclists. The south approach provides a turnaround under the bridge along with lake access for public boating.

=== Aesthetics ===
The steel bridge has a uniform weathered rust finish allowing the bridge to blend in with the surrounding hills and lake.

==History==

=== Planning ===
Originally envisioned as a western circular road, Loop 360 began planning in 1962. As part of Loop 360&#x27;s construction, a contractor was selected to cut into the rock at the site of the future bridge and approach roads due to the area&#x27;s terrain. This rock debris was deposited along the lakeshore at the site of the proposed bridge, raising environmental concerns. At one point, the Austin Navigation Board considered legal action against the contractor responsible for the rock debris.

Throughout the design and build process, concerns were expressed by elected officials and residents over the environmental effects of such a bridge, particularly the possibility of concrete pillars being driven into the lakebed. The bridge was redesigned in 1978 as a tied-arch bridge to avoid placing pillars into the water.

The contract for the bridge was let in late 1979.

=== Construction ===

The 600 short tons (544,311 kg) of steel for the bridge were produced in Japan. The bridge structures were fabricated in Ulsan, Korea by Hyundai Heavy Industries. The steel structures were shipped on the Jundale freighter to the Port of Houston and then trucked to the bridge site. The bridge was erected by Bristol Steel of Bristol, Virginia. The roadway surface is built from of concrete. The finish was sandblasted to ensure even weathering for an amber patina. The construction was coordinated by Clearwater Constructors (Hensel Phelps) of Denver, Colorado. Ed Westall was the project coordinator, Buddy Johnson was the project supervisor and David W. McDonnold was the bridge designing engineer. The bridge cost US$10 million to build.

Additionally, a local metal fabricator, Beck Tool &amp; Manufacturing (Thomas L. Beck, Owner) was contracted to machine many of the critical components that anchor the cables suspending the roadway. Major structural steelwork was finished by July 1982

=== Completion ===
The bridge was dedicated officially November 29, 1982 by Austin mayor Carole McClellan and other public officials and opened for traffic December 3, 1982.

== Naming ==
The bridge is named for Percy V. Pennybacker Jr., who designed bridges for the Texas Highway Department and was a pioneer in the technology of welded structures. Pennybacker, a resident of Austin since 1939, worked for the department for over 20 years before retiring in 1957.

== Awards ==
The bridge won first place in the 1984 Federal Highway Administration&#x27;s Excellence in Highway Design competition. In 1992, the Austin members of the Consulting Engineers Council of Texas were surveyed and selected the bridge as the most innovative example of Austin architecture.

<text>Gold Rush Daze is a 1939 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon directed by Ben Hardaway and Cal Dalton. The short was released on February 25, 1939.

==Plot==

A dog-faced prospector drives to the hills to dig for gold. A local gas station attendant warns him that he is wasting his time, then goes on to tell the story of his own fruitless chase for gold; since 1849, he pursued strikes around the world and never had any success. The cartoon shows the attendant&#x27;s various stops including the California Gold Rush, the Comstock Lode, and various other efforts globally that never (literally) pan out. Then, as the attendant finishes his story, a fellow rides up with news that there has indeed been gold found in the hills. The attendant steals the prospector&#x27;s car to chase this rush, telling him he can have the gas station.

Included in the film is a short, farcical musical number, “My Sweetheart Needs Gold for Her Teeth.&quot;

<text>Lusik and Marut are villages located on the absolute shoreline some 57 kilometres north of Madang on the north-west coast of Papua New Guinea, and are pristine examples of a traditional coastal villages. Lusik faces out to the open ocean, and Marut borders a bay overlooking Kabukum Island.

On the ocean shoreline some of the wonderful coastal trees which thrive under these conditions can be noticed, Barontonia or Box Fruit. This tree is one of the few plants which flower at night to be pollinated by nectar eating bats. As soon as the sun comes up the flower drops off. Nearby is a Calophyllum, with its trunk growing along the ground in search of light. At the waters edge it then grows upward towards the light. This type of tree is extremely important for the coastal people, as the trunks from these trees is used to make the outrigger canoes needed for fishing.

Northern cassowary (Casuarius unappendiculatus), known locally as a muruk, lives in this village. In the wild, these unique territorial birds, not unlike an ostrich or an emu, feed almost exclusively on fallen fruit. Males are smaller than females and alone care for the eggs and young. Eggs are laid on bare ground. Cassowaries are valued by villagers for their meat and feathers. Though wild individuals are wary and avoid man, captive birds are pugnacious and should be avoided for their sometimes lethal kick. This specimen is allowed to range in the forest and scrub near the village, and is fed mainly by the village people.

The men and women of the village work at tending the yam and taro gardens set back in the hinterland. During May and June the Yam Festival is held, with all helping with the harvest and sharing the crop, which is then stored in houses in the village. Celebratory feasts follow.

The housing is all built from traditional materials of bamboo walls, with Kunai grass roofing. The flooring is made from bamboo or libum, a palm not unlike coconut. The housing is built well clear of the ground for ventilation, and fires are often built under the house to reduce the problem of mosquitoes. In these villages, the women do not use a kitchen (or &quot;haus kuk&quot;), but cook their meals of taro, yams, greens in coconut milk over fires in the open.

Walking from Lusik to Marut around the coast, a fine example of Strangler Fig tree can be noticed. It has grown from the base of a Calophyllum tree and has thrown out its aerial roots to a large distance around the host tree.

At the headland between the two villages one can come to a wonderful stand of pandanus trees, with stilt roots providing nourishment and physical support for the main tree.

The tribal chief of these villages is Didol. It is alleged that his great grandparents moved to this land when it was occupied by the Sereureu, who were dwarfs with long fingers, a tail, long nose, big ears and a thick mouth. These people lived in trees, and did not cook their food, but ate all raw. Didol&#x27;s great grandfather fought them and killed most of them, taking over their land. It is said that a few of these people still live in the trees deep in the jungle.

The chief of the village (&quot;Kukurai&quot;) is a hereditary position. His father took over the role after leading a band of his clansmen to battle against neighbouring clans. In victory, he was elected Kukurai, a position then handed down to Didol after his death. His eldest son will inherit the role in time.

Little bay near the village is home to a myriad collection of sea cucumbers or beche de mer, sea stars, corals and fish all within a few feet of the shore.

<text>In topology, a branch of mathematics, a Dehn surgery, named after Max Dehn, is a construction used to modify 3-manifolds. The process takes as input a 3-manifold together with a link. It is often conceptualized as two steps: &quot;drilling&quot; then &quot;filling&quot;.

==Definitions==

* Given a 3-manifold formula_1 and a link formula_2, the manifold formula_1 drilled along formula_4 is obtained by removing an open tubular neighborhood of formula_4 from formula_1. If formula_7, the drilled manifold has formula_8 torus boundary components formula_9. The manifold &quot;formula_1 drilled along formula_4&quot; is also known as the link complement, since if one removed the corresponding closed tubular neighborhood from formula_1, one obtains a manifold diffeomorphic to formula_13.
* Given a 3-manifold whose boundary is made of 2-tori formula_9, we may glue in one solid torus by a homeomorphism (resp. diffeomorphism) of its boundary to each of the torus boundary components formula_15 of the original 3-manifold. There are many inequivalent ways of doing this, in general. This process is called Dehn filling.
* Dehn surgery on a 3-manifold containing a link consists of &quot;drilling out&quot; a tubular neighbourhood of the link together with &quot;Dehn filling&quot; on all the components of the boundary corresponding to the link.

In order to describe a Dehn surgery, one picks two oriented simple closed curves formula_16 and formula_17 on the corresponding boundary torus formula_15 of the drilled 3-manifold, where formula_16 is a meridian of formula_20 (a curve staying in a small ball in formula_1 and having linking number +1 with formula_20 or, equivalently, a curve that bounds a disc that intersects once the component formula_20) and formula_17 is a longitude of formula_15 (a curve travelling once along formula_20 or, equivalently, a curve on formula_15 such that the algebraic intersection formula_28 is equal to +1). 
The curves formula_16 and formula_17 generate the fundamental group of the torus formula_15, and they form a basis of its first homology group. This gives any simple closed curve formula_32 on the torus formula_15 two coordinates formula_34 and formula_35, so that formula_36. These coordinates only depend on the homotopy class of formula_32.

We can specify a homeomorphism of the boundary of a solid torus to formula_15 by having the meridian curve of the solid torus map to a curve homotopic to formula_32. As long as the meridian maps to the surgery slope formula_40, the resulting Dehn surgery will yield a 3-manifold that will not depend on the specific gluing (up to homeomorphism). The ratio formula_41 is called the surgery coefficient of formula_20.

In the case of links in the 3-sphere or more generally an oriented integral homology sphere, there is a canonical choice of the longitudes formula_17: every longitude is chosen so that it is null-homologous in the knot complement—equivalently, if it is the boundary of a Seifert surface. 

When the ratios formula_44 are all integers (note that this condition does not depend on the choice of the longitudes, since it corresponds to the new meridians intersecting exactly once the ancient meridians), the surgery is called an integral surgery. 
Such surgeries are closely related to handlebodies, cobordism and Morse functions.

==Examples==

* If all surgery coefficients are infinite, then each new meridian formula_32 is homotopic to the ancient meridian formula_16. Therefore the homeomorphism-type of the manifold is unchanged by the surgery.

* If formula_1 is the 3-sphere, formula_4 is the unknot, and the surgery coefficient is formula_49, then the surgered 3-manifold is formula_50.

* If formula_1 is the 3-sphere, formula_4 is the unknot, and the surgery coefficient is formula_53, then the surgered 3-manifold is the lens space formula_54. In particular if the surgery coefficient is of the form formula_55, then the surgered 3-manifold is still the 3-sphere.

* If formula_1 is the 3-sphere, formula_4 is the right-handed trefoil knot, and the surgery coefficient is formula_58, then the surgered 3-manifold is the Poincaré dodecahedral space.

==Results==

Every closed, orientable, connected 3-manifold is obtained by performing Dehn surgery on a link in the 3-sphere. This result, the Lickorish–Wallace theorem, was first proven by Andrew H. Wallace in 1960 and independently by W. B. R. Lickorish in a stronger form in 1962. Via the now well-known relation between genuine surgery and cobordism, this result is equivalent to the theorem that the oriented cobordism group of 3-manifolds is trivial, a theorem originally proved by Vladimir Abramovich Rokhlin in 1951.

Since orientable 3-manifolds can all be generated by suitably decorated links, one might ask how distinct surgery presentations of a given 3-manifold might be related. The answer is called the Kirby calculus.

<text>The Harvard–Yale football rivalry is renewed annually with The Game, an American college football match between the Crimson football team of Harvard University and the Bulldogs football team of Yale University.

Though the winner does not take possession of a physical prize, the matchup is usually considered the most important and anticipated game of the year for both teams, regardless of their season records. The Game is scheduled annually as the last contest of the year for both teams; as the Ivy League does not participate in postseason play for football, The Game is the final outing for each team&#x27;s graduating seniors. Some years, the rivalry carries the additional significance of deciding the Ivy League championship.

The weekend of The Game includes more than just the varsity matchup; the respective Yale residential college football teams compete against &quot;sister&quot; Harvard house teams the day before. The Game is third among most-played NCAA Division I football rivalries. Yale leads the series 71–61–8.

&quot;Harvard and Yale generally duke it out in the academic arena&quot;, but geographic proximity, the history of Yale&#x27;s founding and social competition between the respective student and alumni bodies animate the athletic rivalry.

Former Harvard football head coach Joe Restic, who held the position for 23 seasons, quipped regarding his relationship with former Yale football head coach and National Football Foundation/College Football Hall of Fame member Carm Cozza, who held the position for 32 seasons: &quot;Each year, we&#x27;re friends for 364 days and rivals for one.&quot; 

The athletic rivalry is historically the second oldest in American intercollegiate athletics, with Rutgers vs Princeton being the oldest, having played the first ever college football game.

The signature Harvard fight song, &quot;Ten Thousand Men of Harvard&quot;, names Yale in the famous final stanza. The song is sung in the Harvard football locker room after a victory regardless of the opponent. The song is among six Harvard fight songs that mention Yale. &quot;Down the Field&quot; is Yale&#x27;s signature fight song and Harvard is the named foe. The song is among five that mention Harvard. Two of the songs, &quot;Bingo, That&#x27;s the Lingo&quot; and &quot;Goodnight, Harvard&quot;, have been sung substituting Princeton for Harvard when appropriate. Cole Porter composed the former and Douglas Moore the latter.

The football rivalry is among the most admired rivalries on the American athletic scene. The schools and the rivalry established the template for American college football. The Game is the most prominent athletic contest between the schools and has accounted for many of either rival&#x27;s best-publicized athletic feats. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; (College Edition) rated the athletic rivalry sixth-best among American athletic collegiate rivalries behind, in order, AlabamaAuburn, DukeNorth Carolina, UCLAUSC, ArmyNavy and CalStanford. The football rivalry was ranked 8th among Athlon Sports&#x27;s top 25 rivalries in the history of college football.

==Significance==

&quot;A whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard&quot; from &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; by Herman Melville examples public fascination beyond athletics with both institutions. Twelve past presidents of the United States have earned an undergraduate or professional degree from one of the universities. The list includes: John Adams, John Quincy Adams, George Herbert Walker Bush, George Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, Gerald Ford, Rutherford B. Hayes, John F. Kennedy, Barack Obama, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft.

Theodore Roosevelt, a fan of football, is considered often the savior of football in the early 20th century. Roosevelt, who attended the second Harvard–Yale game as a first year student at Harvard College in 1876, has been quoted, &quot;In life as in football, the principle to follow is hit the line hard&quot;. Roosevelt suggested turn-of-the-century &quot;manly virtues&quot; were taught and reinforced on the gridiron.

Walter Camp, captain of the 1878 and 1879 Yale football teams, is considered often &quot;the father&quot; of American football and its most ardent popularizer. Camp attended almost every important rule committee meeting for the sport to his death in 1925 while napping between sessions of the Intercollegiate Football Rule Committee. Camp attended a rules meeting for the sport when he was a student at Hopkins School in New Haven, Connecticut. Camp wrote professionally about the sport, popularizing All-American teams with Caspar Whitney for &quot;This Week&#x27;s Sports&quot; magazine. Eventually &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine featured the annual selections.

The rivalry has been noted in American athletic and popular culture. The University of Mississippi&#x27;s first football team, organized by Alexander Bondurant, adopted Yale blue and crimson for team colors in 1893. Newspapers printed &quot;Bull Tales&quot;, Garry Trudeau&#x27;s collegiate precursor to &quot;Doonesbury&quot; published in the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;, often featuring Brian Dowling and Calvin Hill, in the run-up to the 1968 Yale vs. Harvard football game. &quot;Burns, Baby Burns&quot;, the fourth episode in the eighth season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, depicts Mr. Burns returning to Springfield, Massachusetts after attending The Game.

Thomas G. Bergin, better known for commentary on &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; and longtime Sterling Professor of Romance languages at Yale University, authored &quot;The Game: The Harvard Yale Football Rivalry 1875 – 1983&quot;, published in 1984.

Owen Johnson&#x27;s Dink Stover, Gilbert Patten&#x27;s Frank Merriwell and F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s Tom Buchanan played football for Yale.

===Historical significance===

The first contest was held in 1875, two years after the inaugural Princeton – Yale football contest. Harvard athlete Nathaniel Curtis challenged Yale&#x27;s captain, William Arnold to a rugby-style game. The next season Curtis was captain. He took one look at Walter Camp, then only 156 pounds, and told Yale captain Gene Baker &quot;You don&#x27;t mean to let that child play, do you? ... He will get hurt.&quot;

The Harvard-Yale series is the third most played rivalry in collegiate football history, including 139 games since 1875. In the series, Yale has 70 wins, Harvard has 61 wins, and the teams have tied eight times. Only two collegiate rivalries have played more often than Harvard-Yale. Princeton and Yale have played 143 times since 1873, and Lafayette College and Lehigh University (known simply as &quot;The Rivalry&quot;), have played the most, 157 games, dating back to 1884.

Yale and Harvard have played major roles in advancing and shaping intercollegiate athletics. The first American intercollegiate sporting event took place August 3, 1852 after Yale invited Harvard to a race of crews. The first intercollegiate contests in ice hockey, soccer or five-on-five basketball contests featured teams from Harvard and Yale. Many now century-old aspects of American football were introduced by Harvard or Yale students or athletes. Yale introduced cheerleading at athletic events in 1890. Harvard introduced spring practice to collegiate football March 14, 1889. Yalies sang &quot;Hold the Fort&quot; during the 1892 Harvard game, considered the first public performance of a collegiate &quot;fight song&quot;.

===Reform and Roosevelt===

Years later, representatives from Harvard, Yale and Princeton were summoned to the White House October 9, 1905, by Theodore Roosevelt to discuss reforms to mitigate unnecessarily violent, unsportsmanlike play and minimize resultant fatalities and injuries in football. Roosevelt sought reform of rules to quell misgivings about the sport he admired. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot; advocated reform if not abolishment of the sport. The era&#x27;s progressives, muckrakers, university faculties and presidents—particularly at Harvard, led by its president, Charles W. Eliot and NYU, led by its president Henry MacCracken—and the general public had misgivings about the sport&#x27;s safety and place in higher and secondary school education. Walter Camp, Bill Reid, and Arthur T. Hillebrand attended the meeting, representing respectively Yale, Harvard and Princeton.

The &quot;Grim Reaper Smiles on the Goalposts&quot; cartoon, published December 3, 1905, in the &quot;Cincinnati Commercial Tribune&quot; depicting the Grim Reaper sitting on the crossbar of a goalpost overlooking a mound of uniformed dead bodies exhibited how the press presented the problem. November 25 Union College halfback Harold Moore was knocked unconscious in a game versus NYU. Moore, age 19, died of a cerebral hemorrhage six hours later. MacCracken called a meeting of university leaders to suggest protective gear be worn by the athletes. Reformers requested deemphasis or suspension of the sport. The press reported that 18 athletes, 15 of whom were high school students, died from football-related injuries during the 1905 season. The era has been described as the &quot;first concussion crisis&quot; for the sport.

A meeting convened December 28, 1905, with 62 schools represented to appoint a rules committee. January 12 the American Football Rules Committee met. March 31 the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States was established, the corporate forerunner to the NCAA.

Rules were changed: the flying wedge was banned, the neutral zone was created, and the distance increased to ten yards from five yards for a first down.

===Council of Ivy Group Presidents===
Decades later the eight universities that administer athletic programs and competition under the auspices of the Council of Ivy Group Presidents, better known as the Ivy League, reiterated reforms
rooted in requests made during the series of meetings. Agreements among the athletics departments at Harvard, Yale and Princeton in 1906, 1916 (the &quot;Three Presidents Agreements&quot; on eligibility), and a revision of that agreement in 1923 have been considered precursors to the Ivy Group Agreement, each agreement addressing amateurism and college football.

The Ivy Group Agreement, adopted in 1945, states for football, &quot;the players be truly representative of the student body and not a group of special recruited and trained athletes&quot;. Harvard president Nathan Pusey and Yale president A. Whitney Griswold collaborated closely toward the eventual implementation of the Ivy League in 1954 with the &quot;Agreement&quot; extended to all sports. Round-robin play started in 1956 for football among programs representing Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University.

==Game results==

† The 1881 game is recognized by both teams as a Yale victory due to four fewer safeties.

‡ Hosted ESPN&#x27;s College Gameday.

All games since 1956 are Ivy League contests. The teams did not play in 2020 due to the Ivy League cancelling the 2020 football season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Regular season overtime was introduced for Division I-AA in 1981 and was first used in the 2005 game.
==Stadiums==
The contests are hosted in stadiums listed on the U.S. National Register of Historical Places and are U.S. National Historic Landmarks. They are among the oldest gridiron football stadiums.

=== Yale Bowl ===
Designs for the Rose Bowl and Michigan Stadium were influenced by the Yale Bowl Stadium. When the Bowl was built by Charles Ferry in 1914
the Colosseum of Pompeii in Italy was the only other known structure in the world engineered by digging a hole then using the displaced dirt to build the surrounding wall or berm. The Bowl had the largest seating capacity for a stadium in the world upon completion of construction. Head coach Carm Cozza likened the feeling of running through the tunnel onto the Bowl to a gladiator entering the arena.

The Yale Bowl, completed before World War I, presaged a collegiate stadium-building blitz associated with the game&#x27;s popularity in the Roaring Twenties. The modern era of college football, with radio broadcasts coast to coast of gridiron exploits by Red Grange or the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame, began soon after the construction of stadiums that rivaled the Yale Bowl&#x27;s seating capacity. The Rose Bowl venue, its annual post-season contest, and the plethora of venues and post-season football contests known as &quot;bowls&quot; has been attributed to the Yale Bowl.

Walter Camp had been the long-tenured treasurer of the Yale Athletic Union, precursor to the later professional athletic department administration. Yale swim athlete and team manager Robert Moses—acknowledged later in life as the power broker of urban planning and a &quot;master builder&quot;—had disagreements with Camp regarding the Athletic Union&#x27;s treasury. Moses wrote editorials in two campus papers and lobbied Camp and the administration for larger sums for the minor sports (every sport save football, rowing and hockey) from the fund swelled by football receipts. Camp conceded little. Camp&#x27;s big idea was to fund eventually the Yale Bowl Stadium.

The Walter Camp Memorial Arch greets visitors to the Walter Camp Fields on Derby Avenue in front of the Bowl. A seven-person committee, including Yale Law School Dean Robert Hutchins, who would later abolish a storied football program at University of Chicago, raised money for the arch from a variety of sources, including 224 colleges and universities, and 279 high schools and prep schools.

=== Harvard Stadium ===
Harvard Stadium was built in 1903. The 25th Anniversary Reunion gift by the Harvard Class of 1879 funded the project.

The stadium is the nation&#x27;s oldest permanent concrete structure dedicated to intercollegiate athletics. The stadium mimics the Panathenaic Stadium. Henry Lee Higginson, founder of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and first president of the Harvard Club of Boston, donated the land, known as Soldier&#x27;s Field, for a memorial to Harvard men who were killed during the American Civil War.

Camp accommodated Harvard on the issue of widening the playing field to &quot;open up&quot; play from the almost perpetual rugby scrum that characterized the sport. The rules reform movement, which gained impetus after the 1905 meeting at the White House, demanded action. 
The present standardized playing field width was as wide as could be accommodated in Harvard Stadium, the first football stadium constructed with reinforced concrete and a pioneering execution in the construction of large structures. The forward pass was adopted instead of an even wider field. The rule change is mentioned often as the most important in the history of the sport. John Heisman championed the forward pass and is credited with lobbying successfully influential members of the IIAUS American Football Rules Committee to adopt the change.

==Notable contests==

=== 1875 ===
The game, a rugby contest in fact but called &quot;Foot Ball&quot;, played November 13 in New Haven at Hamilton Park was won by Harvard. The &quot;Foot Ball Match&quot; was played under &quot;concessionary rules&quot;. Harvard conceded to aspects of the soccer-like &quot;Foot Ball&quot; played by Yale while Yale conceded likewise to Harvard&#x27;s rugby-informed play, featured in the Harvard–McGill game of 1874.

The contest has been noted as the first ever when both teams donned coordinated uniforms. The teams fielded fifteen athletes to a side. Through plebiscite, Harvard students picked crimson over magenta as the school color and athletic nickname.

Yale would win consecutively ten games and tie once before Harvard would win again, 12–6 in 1890, a season Harvard claimed a national championship. Harvard&#x27;s record in the series was once 9–23–5 through the start of World War I. &quot;Harvard felt a certain loss of manhood in not winning a single football game with Yale in the eighties and only to win one in the nineties&quot;, historian Samuel Eliot Morison noted in &quot;Three Centuries of Harvard 1636–1936&quot;.

=== 1876 ===

The 1876 game was the first won by Yale, and the first game Walter Camp played in. Eugene V. Baker was the captain. O. D. Thompson scored on Harvard.

=== 1887 ===
On November 24, the year&#x27;s Thanksgiving holiday, Yale defeated Harvard, 17–8, at the Polo Grounds in New York City before 18,000 spectators. Harvard had yielded six points total the entire season. For the third time in the brief history of the rivalry both squads sported undefeated and untied records. William H. Corbin, the 1888 team captain and future Yale head coach known as &quot;Pa&quot; Corbin, is credited with leading Yale to the victory and a 9–0 record, with Harvard&#x27;s season ending with a 10–1 record. The game ball was discovered and picked up by an oyster boat in the water in March 1890 and returned to Yale.

=== 1890 ===
The 1890 game was played on November 22 at Hampden Park in Springfield, Massachusetts. Harvard ended the season undefeated and untied, 11–0, defeating Yale, 12–6. Yale finished the season with a 12–1 record. The victory is considered possibly the greatest in the history of Harvard Crimson football and Arthur Cumnock, team captain, as Harvard&#x27;s greatest football player. Harvard won its second game in the series and ended a streak that included one tie and ten losses.

Cumnock, who captained the 1889 and 1890 Crimson teams, is credited with convening the first spring practice in collegiate football.

=== 1891 ===
The 1891 game was held on November 21, again in Springfield, again with Harvard and Yale undefeated and untied for the contest; Yale won 10–0. Yale finished the season with a 13–0 record. Harvard, nursing a 23-game win streak over two seasons, ended the season 13–1.

The play of the game was a fumble returned for a touchdown by Laurie Bliss. Frank Hinkey separated Crimson back Hamilton Forbush Corbett from the ball that Bliss retrieved on the fly.

=== 1892 ===
Harvard introduced the flying wedge to football November 19 at the beginning of the second half before 21,000 spectators. Captain Vance McCormack warned his Yale teammates upon witnessing the formation, &quot;Boys, this is something new but play the game as you have been taught. Keep your eyes open and do not let them draw you in&quot;.

Lorin F. Deland, an unpaid adviser to the Harvard team and an avid chess player, suggested the tactic. Yale won, 6–0.

The flying wedge was outlawed two years after its introduction. Bergin writes, &quot;The legacy of the wedge is perceptible in the austere rules of today&#x27;s game, by which a &#x27;man in motion&#x27; can run away from the line literally, but if he takes a step forward before the ball is snapped his team is penalized. Offensive lineman must not move a muscle or even turn their heads before the snap.&quot;

Deland would coach Harvard for three games in 1895 and co-author with Walter Camp the seminal &quot;Football&quot; published in 1896.

Mass-momentum plays based on the flying wedge were the rage in the sport. The result was mayhem that eventually prompted intervention in 1905 by Teddy Roosevelt to help reform rules governing play.

=== 1894 ===
Held on November 24, Yale won the 1894 game 12–4, at Hampden Park. The contest, a bloody mess of a game, was known for on-field and off-field
violence. In an era before players employed protective equipment of any type, the result of rough play was a given; however, competition between the Yale and Harvard football programs was placed on hiatus, seven players denoted in &quot;dying condition&quot; after the contest, according to the German daily newspaper &quot;Munchener Nachrichten&quot;.

Frank Hinkey has been alleged to have broken the collarbone of a Harvard player following a fair catch. Yale tackle Fred Murphy broke the nose of Harvard&#x27;s Bob Hallowell during an official&#x27;s conference; in turn, Murphy absorbed a hard hit later in the contest that hospitalized him. Rumors circulated after the game that he died in a local hospital. Violence ensued among fans in the streets of Springfield.

The Harvard faculty voted by a two-to-one margin to abolish football. Harvard president Charles W. Eliot supported the faculty. Eliot opined, &quot;Football is to academics what bull fighting is to agriculture&quot;.

The Harvard Corporation sided, however, with alumni and students who championed the sport. The Harvard Board of Overseers invited Camp to chair an investigative committee to determine the extent of &quot;character-building&quot; as well as &quot;brutality&quot; on college and prep school football fields. Rev. Joseph Twichell, Endicott Peabody and Henry E. Howland were among the committee&#x27;s members.

Ray Tompkins, a former teammate of Camp&#x27;s, as well as a two-time captain at the guard position, confided to Camp during the crisis of &#x27;94 that football was too American to be abrogated by any one or more faculty. Tompkins later would be namesake to the building, Ray Tompkins House, that serves as the administrative headquarters for Yale athletics.

Yale and Harvard took a two-year hiatus on the football rivalry. The programs have played annually ever since, excluding the World War I and World War II years and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== 1898 ===
On the November 19 game, two future members of the National Football Foundation/College Football Hall of Fame showcased apt athletic and leadership ability, leading Harvard to a 17–0 victory. Both would later coach the Crimson. Bill Reid, a fullback, scored two touchdowns versus Yale. Harvard achieved a rare victory in the series, its third in 19 contests. Reid was rewarded with his picture published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Percy D. Haughton was on the gridiron, too, for the Crimson.

The now traditional end of season scheduling started this date and continues to the present.

=== 1900 ===
On November 24 in Orange, Connecticut at Yale Field, the undefeated and untied Harvard and Yale teams met once more, with Yale winning 28–0. Gordon Brown, a four-time first team All American at the guard position, captained a team that held eleven of thirteen opponents scoreless.

=== 1903 ===
On November 21, Harvard hosted Yale at Harvard Stadium for the first time. Yale won, 16–0, before an estimated crowd of 40,000.

Harvard opened the facility with a game versus Dartmouth the week before.

=== 1905 ===
November 25 was the conclusion of another undefeated, untied season for Yale. An estimated crowd of 43,000 at Soldiers Field witnessed a 6–0 Yale win and enough violent play to prompt the delivery of a note from the benefactor who donated to Soldiers Field to Harvard, Henry Lee Higginson, to Crimson head coach Bill Reid. The note requested the withdrawal of the Crimson team from the playing field; Reid ignored the request.

Bob Forbes was the only player to cross the goal line.

Harvard finished the season 8–2–1, Yale 10–0.

=== 1908 ===
The game played November 21 marked the end of a six-game winning streak for Yale. Harvard won, 4–0, on a field goal by Victor Kennard, a fullback, at Yale Field in Orange, Connecticut. Hamilton Fish III, captain of the 1909 team (and acting captain 1908 when that year&#x27;s captain was injured) was a mainstay at tackle the 1907–1909 seasons.

Percy Haughton, Harvard&#x27;s first professional coach, was understood to have strangled to death a bulldog during the pregame pep talk. This contest was his first as a head coach versus Yale. Contemporary research concludes that at worse Haughton &quot;strangled&quot; a &quot;papier mache&quot; bulldog and tied another such creation to the back fender of his automobile.

=== 1909 ===
On November 20 in Boston, Harvard and Yale competed for the national championship. Ted Coy captained the Yale squad which shutout Harvard, 8–0. Coy threw a touchdown pass and Harvard didn&#x27;t advance pass the Yale 30 yard line the entire contest. Harvard fielded two future NFF/College Football Hall of Fame members, Bob Fisher—a future head coach for the Crimson—and Hamilton Fish. The pair were respectively right guard and right tackle on offense. Their coach Percy Haughton also would win election to the Hall of Fame.

Harvard would dominate the series from 1909 to 1922, earning an 8–1–2 record.

=== 1914 ===
The game played on November 21 was the inaugural event at the Yale Bowl. William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt were said to be among the spectators, a throng estimated at between 70,000 and 74,000. Harvard won, 36–0.

The day&#x27;s memorable play was a 98-yard touchdown run after a recovered fumble by Jeff Coolidge. Coolidge gathered the Yale fumble with Harvard leading by two touchdowns.

&quot;Yale has the Bowl but Harvard has the punch&quot; was reportedly repeated often in the press the next day.

=== 1915 ===
On November 20, Harvard defeated Yale 41–0, the program&#x27;s largest margin of victory in the series. Team captain Eddie Mahan scored four touchdowns and kicked five extra points.

The week before the Yale game and subsequent to the Brown game, won 16–7 by Harvard, William J. Bingham, a track star and team captain, authored an announcement under byline in the November 15 issue of the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot;. Bingham thought poorly of the cheering and singing among students at the Brown game and announced a pep rally for Thursday to support Mahan and head coach Haughton before the Yale game. Bingham was appointed Harvard&#x27;s first athletic director a decade later. He held the position 1926–1951.
Harvard&#x27;s most prestigious athletic award is named in his honor, the winner announced at the Harvard Varsity Club&#x27;s annual Senior
Letterwinner Dinner.

=== 1919 ===
Harvard coach Bob Fisher&#x27;s team concluded an undefeated regular season November 22 with a 10–3 victory at the Stadium before an estimated crowd of 50,000.

Arnold Horween, who would later coach the Crimson, kicked a field goal and Eddie Casey scored on a reception in the first half. Robert Sedgwick helped anchor an outstanding offensive and defensive line that day and throughout the season. Only one touchdown was scored against Harvard during the season.

Harvard won later the 1920 East–West Tournament Bowl, now known as the Rose Bowl, versus the Oregon Webfoots, now known as the Oregon Ducks, 10–7.

=== 1920 ===
Harvard dominated completely Yale at the Bowl, 9–0, before an estimated crowd of nearly 80,000. Charles Buell kicked two field goals and Arnold Horween kicked one while Harvard controlled the line of scrimmage. The Harvard team outrushed its Yale counterpart 195 yards to 68 and outpassed it 124 yards to 43. Buell quarterbacked the national champions.

=== 1923 ===
On November 24, the game was played on, according to Grantland Rice, &quot;a gridiron of seventeen lakes, five quagmires and a water hazard&quot; in Boston. Yale won, 13–0. Ducky Pond, future Yale head coach and All American for the season, returned a fumble 67 yards for a touchdown, Yale&#x27;s first touchdown versus Harvard since World War I.

Yale head coach T.A. Dwight Jones, future member of the College Football Hall of Fame, advised before the opening kickoff, &quot;Gentlemen, you are about to play Harvard. You will never do anything else so important for the rest of your lives.&quot; Yale, who defeated Army and then Princeton at the Yale Bowl before crowds of an estimated 80,000 and ended the season scoring 230 points and yielding 38, entered the contest with claim to the national championship. &quot;Memphis&quot; Bill Mallory, Century Milstead and Mal Stevens contributed to the victory. Bill Mallory, team captain and future member of the College Football Hall of Fame, kicked two field goals in the third quarter to complete the scoring.

The Yale athletics department awards a prize commemorating Mallory, who died in a plane crash while serving in the Army Air Forces in World War II, to &quot;the senior man who, on the field of play and in his life at Yale, best represents the highest ideals of American sportsmanship and Yale tradition&quot;. The winner is announced at Class Day.

The 1956 Yale Banner, the senior class yearbook, published, &quot;Bill Mallory was, to put it mildly, an all-around football player. He backed the line sharply, ran effectively, kicked field goals with unbelievable skill, and blocked flawlessly. It was his leadership, perhaps, more than any other factor, that brought Yale its last undefeated, untied season.&quot; The 1960 Yale football team would duplicate the feat.

=== 1925 ===
On November 21, the game, between a 5–2 Yale team and a 4–3 Harvard team, ended in what the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; hailed as &quot;a scoreless victory&quot;. T.A.D. Jones&#x27;s charges could not decide what play to call on the Harvard one-foot line against Bob Fisher&#x27;s defense as time ran down in the fourth quarter.

Yale was in &quot;scoring position&quot; six times over the course of the contest, but never crossed the goal line. This game is the last scoreless tie in the series.

=== 1931 ===
The November 21 contest showcased the final gridiron competition between Yale captain Albie Booth and Harvard captain Barry Wood, who lettered three times each in football, ice hockey and baseball.

Harvard was undefeated at 7–0. Yale was 3–1–2. Booth kicked a late fourth quarter field goal, the sole points scored.

=== 1932 ===
The November 19 game was played for 35,000 to 50,000 fans at Yale Bowl, including Babe Ruth, a &quot;loyal Crimson fan&quot; among them, who endured an unreleting rain off Long Island Sound. Walter Levering and Walter Marting scored touchdowns and Yale shut out Harvard 13–0. Walter Marting&#x27;s son, Walter Marting, Jr., known as Del, would win varsity letters three seasons in the sixties and participate in the rivalry&#x27;s historic 1968 contest.

=== 1936 ===
On November 21, Yale won, 14–13, at the Bowl. Heisman Trophy winner Larry Kelley captained the squad. Future Heisman trophy winners Clint Frank and Kelley collaborated on a 42-yard pass play, Kelley scoring, to forge a 14–0 halftime lead. Harvard missed an extra point in the fourth quarter and Yale held on for the win. Yale, with a 7–1 record, was ranked 12th in the final AP Poll.

=== 1937 ===
On November 20 Harvard won, 13–6, through snow flurries at the Stadium. The teams rushing attacks totaled 434 yards. Harvard&#x27;s Torbert Macdonal, who would captain the 1939 Crimson team, gained 102 yards on 10 carries. Yale&#x27;s Al Hessberg gained 98 yards on 15 carries. Clint Frank scored on a one-yard run in the third quarter.

Yale&#x27;s second Heisman Trophy winner played with a severe injury most of the contest but made &quot;fifty tackles&quot; according to Stanley Woodward, the sports journalist credited with the first printed mention of the &quot;ivy colleges&quot; or Ivy League, of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. Woodward hailed Frank &quot;the best football player we have seen&quot; since World War I. The Yale team finished 12th in the final AP Poll ranking.

=== 1941 ===
November 22 was Harvard senior Endicott Peabody II&#x27;s final performance versus Yale. Peabody started three straight seasons on the offensive line. Harvard rushed from scrimmage for 270 yards, Don McNicol accounting for 179 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries.

Harvard shut out Yale, 28–0, in 1940, and shut out Yale, 14–0, in 1941.

Peabody finished sixth in the balloting for the season&#x27;s Heisman Trophy, and later served a term as governor of Massachusetts.

=== 1949 ===
On November 19, Yale won, 29–6, led by Levi Jackson, its first African-American captain. Jackson was born in Branford, Connecticut, and reared in New Haven, where he was a graduate of Hillhouse High School. Jackson had been a sergeant in the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps during World War II before matriculating at Yale. Jackson scored the day&#x27;s first and second touchdowns.

;1952
On November 22, Yale won, 41–14, at the Stadium. The box score noted Charley Yeager scored Yale&#x27;s 41st point on a pass reception, from the holder. (Conversions were worth one point, kicked, run, or passed in that era.) Yeager, who stood 5 feet, 5 inches and weighed 145 pounds, was Yale&#x27;s head football manager. Yeager wore a pristine jersey numbered 99 as he scored on a square-out route, flanked right.

&quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; reported the Walter Mittyesque feat in subsequent issues. At the time, rumblings were heard that Harvard might cease fielding a football team.

=== 1955 ===
The November 19 game was won by Yale, 21–7. Ted Kennedy, in jersey numbered 88, caught a pass for a touchdown in the third quarter for Harvard&#x27;s sole touchdown in New Haven on a snowy day before a crowd that included his brother, Senator John F. Kennedy, Connecticut&#x27;s governor Abe Ribicoff, and New York City&#x27;s mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. Denny McGill scored Yale&#x27;s 20th point on an interception. Offensive tackles Phil Tarasovic, the team captain, and William Post Lovejoy, winner of the Mallory Award for the class of 1956, helped Yale running backs Gene Coker, Al Ward, and Denny McGill gain 238 rushing yards on 45 carries. Harvard, in turn, was held to 78 rushing yards on 33 carries.

Charley Yeager was recalled as fondly as he might be by Harvard denizens of the Dillon Field House. &quot;Remember Charley Yaeger&quot; was chalked prominently in block letters on the Harvard athletics center during the week leading up to Yale&#x27;s win.

Crimson coach Lloyd Jordan, a future member of the College Football Hall of Fame, was replaced by John Yovicsin in the off season.

=== 1956 ===
On November 24, Denny McGill gained 116 yards on 8 carries and scored on runs of two and seventy-eight yards to stake Yale a 14–0 lead. Play turned unsportsmanlike toward the end of Yale&#x27;s 42–14 rout, clinching the inaugural Ivy League football title.

The Ivy League athletic conference became fully operational in 1956. Yale won the first Ivy League football title with an undefeated, untied record playing a round-robin schedule versus Harvard, Princeton, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth and Penn.

=== 1957 ===
On November 23, Harvard first year head coach John Yovicsin, recommended by Dick Harlow, brought his team to New Haven with an injured starting quarterback. Yale lead 34–0 by halftime; the Harvard Class of 1947 dispatched a telegram to Yovicsin&#x27;s counterpart, Jordan Olivar, to &quot;Please&quot; take it easy on the Crimson in the second half. Yale scored 20 points to complete the scoring.

Including this contest, the Crimson would enjoy a 35–24–1 record versus the Bulldogs over the next six decades under three head coaches, Yovicsin, Restic and Murphy. By contrast, the Yale program had six coaches during the period, four during Murphy&#x27;s career at Harvard.

=== 1960 ===
Mike Pyle, future Chicago Bears center and NFL All-Pro, captained an undefeated, untied Yale team to the 1960 Ivy League football title, 14th place on the AP Poll, and a share of the Lambert Trophy after Yale routed Harvard, 39–6, on November 19. Pyle, who would captain the 1963 NFL Championship–winning Bears, lead the last untied and undefeated Yale team since 1923.

Yale&#x27;s first play from scrimmage netted a 41-yard touchdown run by Ken Wolfe. Harvard quarterback Charlie Ravenal turned over a pitchout that John Hutcherson returned 42 yards for a touchdown early in the afternoon. Harvard scored with Yale leading, 39–0.

=== 1963 ===
The game played November 30, which Yale won, 20–6, was postponed from November 23 in mourning for assassinated president of the United States John F. Kennedy, Harvard College Class of 1940 and Yale University 1962 honor and commencement speaker. Arrangements had been made during the week by the Secret Service for Kennedy to attend the contest at Yale after the trip to Dallas. Kennedy had earned a JV football letter at Harvard. Chuck Mercein lead all running backs with 63 total rushing yards and made two of three PATs.

=== 1967 and 1968 ===
&quot;The games played in 1967 and 1968 were a pair of back-to-back thrillers unique in the chronicles. Both were filled with action, great individual efforts, and costly misplays, each terminating in breathtaking climaxes ... each had the outline of high melodrama&quot;, Tom Bergin wrote the above in his definitive &quot;The Game: The Harvard-Yale Football Rivalry, 1875–1983&quot;.

Yale won, 24–20, on a soggy playing surface under clearing skies on November 25, 1967, at the Yale Bowl. A crowd of 68,315, understood as the largest crowd to attend a football game in the Ivy League era, was present.

Yale scored first on a recovery in the endzone. Offensive end Del Marting scored. The second score, off a lengthy improvisational quarterback scramble by Dowling, was a 53-yard pass completion to Calvin Hill. Hill remarked to Dan Jenkins, reporting for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;We do that a lot. It&#x27;s kind of a play. Dowling gets in trouble and I wave my hand and he throws it to me.&quot; A fieldgoal was the 17th point. Then, Harvard scored three touchdowns, one each in the second, third and fourth quarters. Harvard, led by left handed quarterback Ric Zimmerman, Vic Gatto (next year&#x27;s captain) and Ray Hornblower, overcame a seventeen-point Yale lead to score twenty unanswered points. Then, late in the fourth quarter Dowling delivered deftly a 66-yard pass to Del Marting for the winning touchdown. Yale claimed the victory soon after Ken O&#x27;Connell fumbled on Harvard&#x27;s next series.

The game played November 23, 1968, was highlighted by the Crimson scoring 16 points in the final 42 seconds to tie a highly touted Bulldog squad. Harvard All Ivy punter and Harvard Varsity Club Hall of Fame member Gary Singleterry has recalled that the 1968 game and season was a triumph of the human spirit for Harvard football.

Harvard head coach John Yovicsin substituted twice quarterback Frank Champi—number 27, the man of the moment who earned one varsity H at Harvard—for George Lalich to reignite the Crimson&#x27;s nearly-extinguished offense. Champi singed the Yale defense at the close of the first half with a touchdown drive (however, Yovicsin returned Champi to the bench at the start of the second half), then Champi, again substituting for the lackluster Lalich, immolated the Yale defense in the closing minutes of the contest. Yale lost six fumbles, an all-time record, adding logs to the fire.

Poor officiating and poor timekeeping contributed to the outcome, Yale partisans and players have suggested; nonetheless, Pete Varney, who would later play in the MLB, ran a slant route and caught a pass right in front of Yale linebacker Ed Franklin, giving Harvard its 29th point.

Yale had a 16-game winning streak. Both teams were 8–0. For the first time since 1909, both adversaries were undefeated and untied for the contest. Yale was ranked at the lower end of a few top national college football polls. Calvin Hill, soon to be the first ever and only Ivy League football athlete selected in the first round of the NFL draft, and Tommy Lee Jones, an offensive guard for Harvard, were in uniform.

The Penn Quakers finished third in the standings and won five League games by close scores but were defeated by Harvard, 28–6, and Yale, 30–13. By contrast, Yale had defeated, in order, excluding the Penn game—which was Yale&#x27;s fifth win in the League—Brown, 35–15, Columbia, 29–7, Cornell 25–13, Dartmouth, 47–27, and Princeton, 42–17.

The Yale roster included two future Rhodes Scholars, Kurt Schmoke and Tom Neville, who would later captain a Yale football squad. The Harvard roster included one future Rhodes Scholar, Paul Saba.

The outcome inspired &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; to print the logically impossible &quot;Harvard Beats Yale, 29–29&quot; headline. This headline was later used as the title for a 2008 documentary about this Game, directed by Kevin Rafferty.

&quot;Yale Daily News&quot; editors headlined &quot;Johns Stage Dramatic Rally Tie Elis For Title, 29 – All&quot; at top right half of frontpage of its November 25, 1968, issue.

John T. Downey, a Yale football letterwinner before joining the CIA, was a prisoner-of-war in 1968. His Chinese captors allowed correspondences from home while he endured solitary confinement. Downey received from a friend a postcard announcing Yale had won, 29–13. Months later he learned of the &quot;loss&quot;.

=== 1969 ===
On November 22, Yale outlasted Harvard, 7–0, and shared the League football title with Dartmouth and Princeton. Each team suffered one loss.

Future NFL defensive back and coach Don Martin and Bill Primps, who scored the sole touchdown, combined for 162 rushing yards. Captain Andy Coe lead the defense to the shutout. Harvard&#x27;s offense help preserve the shutout. The unit advanced to the Yale ten yard line in the last few minutes of the fourth quarter but missed anticlimactically a 32-yard field goal attempt moments before game time expired.

=== 1972 ===
In Boston on November 25, Yale overcame a 17–0 Harvard second quarter lead with 28 unanswered points. Yale won, 28–17.

Dick Jauron, who rushed for 183 yards, setting the all-time record in the series, and captain Dick Perschel, at linebacker, lead the Bulldogs to the come-from-behind victory. Harvard&#x27;s Ted DeMars rushed for 153 yards, including an 86-yard first quarter touchdown. Harvard was held scoreless after quarterback Eric Crone&#x27;s one-yard touchdown run and the successful conversion kick. Momentum swung away from Harvard after fumbling on its one-yard line later in the quarter. Tyrell Henning scored eventually for Yale. Momentum swung seemingly further toward Yale when a Harvard punt was blocked on the subsequent set of downs; however, Jauron was stopped at the 1-yard line before halftime. Jauron scored on a seventy-four run early in the third quarter.

Jauron, among a myriad of awards, won the Gridiron Club of Greater Boston George H. &quot;Bulger&quot; Lowe award for the season.

=== 1974 ===
On November 22, Harvard Stadium was the setting for a late fourth quarter 95-yard drive that defeated an undefeated and untied Yale team. Senior quarterback, first year starter and eventual All Ivy First Team football selection Milt Holt lead the Harvard offense to the winning touchdown through a Yale defense that lead the League in many statistical categories. Holt scored on a sweep around left end for Harvard&#x27;s 20th point. The Crimson won, 21–16. Harvard and Yale both finished the season 6–1 in the League and shared the title.

Gary Fencik caught 11 passes for 187 yards in the losing effort. Fencik was one of a total of six varsity letterwinners on the field—with Yale teammates Elvin Charity and Vic Staffieri (whom Carm Cozza described as &quot;the best captain I ever had&quot; when Staffieri lead the 1976 Bulldogs team), and Bill Emper, Dan Jiggetts, and Pat McInally for Harvard—who were named later to the Ivy League Silver Anniversary team. Greg Dubinetz, a Yale senior lineman, was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the ninth round of the 1975 NFL draft and enjoyed a brief professional football career.

=== 1975 ===
The game played November 22 in New Haven—the outcome elevating Harvard to its first undisputed League football championship (it had shared titles three other seasons since 1956, the League&#x27;s first year) – featured future Chicago Bears teammates Harvard captain Dan Jiggetts and Yale captain Gary Fencik. Fencik helped win Super Bowl XX and a Gold Record with the Bears.

Harvard won, 10–7, on a fourth quarter field goal by Mike Lynch with 0:33 on the official time clock.

=== 1978 ===
Future three-time Super Bowl champion Kenny Hill ran well from the I formation, 154 yards on 25 carries, and scored down a sideline on an 18-yard pitchout, and Yale won, 35–28, in Boston on November 18. Larry Brown, Harvard&#x27;s senior quarterback, set a Harvard standard for touchdown passes in The Game. Neil Rose, Ryan Fitzpatrick, a future NFL starting quarterback, and Chris Pizzotti would each toss four touchdowns versus Yale in 2001, 2003, and 2007, respectively, matching Brown.

Brown would teach a seminar at Harvard on the multiflex the next academic semester.

The most memorable pass of the afternoon was tossed by a future participant in the NFL. Tight end John Spagnola, a future eleven year NFL veteran and participant in Super Bowl XV, lofted a spiral to fellow receiver Bob Krystyniak for a touchdown to conclude a trick play. The extra point provided the 21-point cushion Brown almost wore out with two more touchdown passes.

Carm Cozza fielded questions on the 1968 contest for a portion of his post-game interview.

=== 1979 ===
On November 17, Harvard upset, 22–7, an undefeated, untied, 13.5 point Las Vegas-favored Yale team in New Haven before an estimated crowd of 72,000. &quot;The Crimson&quot; was shocked by the outcome, publishing the following week a sports column under the headline &quot;The Shock of 1979&quot;. Yale had clinched the League title the week before with a 35–10 victory over Princeton at Palmer Stadium. Not even the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; sports editor, or a peer at any of the other seven League newspapers, predicted Harvard would win.

Harvard running back Jim Callinan and the offense set the tone with an opening game drive of 74 yards, 64 by the run, on 17 plays. Callinan caught a 23-yard touchdown pass later in the afternoon. Harvard ran for 152 yards from scrimmage while Yale managed 92 yards. Yale fumbled six times but recovered three, unlike the 1968 Yale team that fumbled six times with Harvard recovering each fumble.

Harvard lost its starting and backup quarterback before the season started. Injuries forced four other quarterbacks onto the field with hope each had mastered Joe Restic&#x27;s complicated multiflex offense. Brian Buckley, Ron Cuccia, Mike Smerczynski, Joe Lahti, Mike Buchannan, and Burke St. John—who quarterbacked the 22 – 7 victory—were each listed at least once as the Crimson&#x27;s starting quarterback during the season. Harvard employed two tightends and an unbalanced offensive line to control the line scrimmage.

Harvard finished the season 3 – 6 and thwarted again a Yale team a win away from an unblemished football season. Yale would have celebrated its first undefeated, untied season since 1960 and its second in 56 years with a win. Yale clinched sole possession of the League football title the week before at Princeton.

=== 1983 ===
The game played on November 19 marked the 100th time the programs met on the gridiron. Harvard won, 16–7, in New Haven. Captain, linebacker and later Bingham Award winner Joe Azelby led the Crimson. Harvard outrushed Yale 259 yards to 61. Yale endured its worst season of all time, finishing 1–9.

Tragedy struck the ensuing post-game celebration on the field when a Harvard student was struck by a toppled goal post. 

Yale led the series 54–38–8 at the 100 game mark.

=== 1987 ===
On November 21, the weather conditions at the Bowl were somewhat similar to the 1967 NFL Championship Game in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Game time temperature approached the high teens and 40 mph wind chilled the &quot;real feel&quot; temperatures to sub-zero Fahrenheit throughout the day. Harvard won, 14–10, before an announced crowd of 66,548.

Joe Restic guided the Crimson 8–2 overall and 6–1 League records, both bests for Restic. Harvard won the League football title.

=== 1993 ===
On November 20, a gameball was presented to Theo Epstein, a &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; sports section editor. Epstein, later a noted sports executive, authored a column calling for Yale head coach Carm Cozza to retire, published the day before the 110th contest in the series. The column appeared to arouse the Bulldogs. Harvard, the program playing its last game under Joe Restic, appeared aroused, too. The 33–31 outcome is the all–time highest combined score in the series. Both teams had each won one game, and not versus Princeton, in the League entering the contest. The teams both finished with 3–7 overall records.

Twenty five years before, almost to date, Harvard achieved a climatic 29–29 win versus Yale. &quot;The New York Times&quot; sportswriter William N. Wallace wrote &quot;Twenty-five years ago Harvard scored 26 points in the last 42 seconds at Cambridge to tie Yale, 29–29, in an epic battle between two undefeated teams.&quot; (Wallace authored an authoritative book on an important game in the Princeton–Yale football rivalry, &quot;Yale&#x27;s Ironmen: A Story of Football + Lives in the Decade of the Depression + Beyond&quot;.) Harvard mounted a fourth quarter comeback, and though it mauled the Yale return man and caused a melee on an onside kick after scoring on a 77-yard pass and a run play for the 2-point coconversion, the Crimson couldn&#x27;t send off Restic with a victory.

=== 1995 ===
On November 18 in New Haven, Harvard, 1–6 in the League, defeated Yale, 22–21. Coach Murphy&#x27;s charges would soon dominate the series. Murphy scored an astounding 17–6 versus four Yale counterparts, including Carm Cozza.

=== 1999 ===
On November 20, quarterback Eric Walland and receiver Eric Johnson set single game Yale records for passing yardage, passing attempts and completions, 437 yards on 42 completions from 67 attempts, and receiving yardage and receptions, 244 yards and 21 receptions. Yale won the contest on a touchdown pass to Johnson from Walland with 0:29 remaining in the game.

Yale rallied late and in thrilling fashion to win the year before and the year after.

=== 2001 ===
On November 17, Harvard defeated Yale, 35–23, in New Haven. The win sealed the Crimson&#x27;s first perfect season since 1913. Percy Haughton had last lead Harvard to undefeated and untied seasons, 9–0, in 1912 and 1913. Yale&#x27;s three-game win streak in the series ended. Neil Rose completed four touchdown passes.

=== 2004 ===
On November 20, the Harvard team, a team that eight times scored at least 30 points against an opponent during the season, completed the program&#x27;s third undefeated season with a 35–3 victory versus Yale. Future NFL quarterback and Buffalo Bills captain Ryan Fitzpatrick, who captained the Harvard team, earned the season&#x27;s Frederick Greeley Crocker award as team MVP and the Asa Bushnell Cup as League Player of the Year. Fifteen Harvard athletes were named to the All-Ivy squad. The undefeated season was Tim Murphy&#x27;s second in four seasons.

Yale undergraduate pranksters, led by Michael Kai and David Aulicino, won handily, too. The 2004 Harvard–Yale prank gained national press coverage through the early part of the week following the contest. &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, among other news, sports and entertainment media, gave notice that Harvard fans raised cards in unison that read &quot;WE SUCK&quot;. Yale fans applauded appreciatively in acknowledgement from the other side of Soldiers Field.

=== 2005 ===
Clifton Dawson&#x27;s 258th carry for the season, a record, delivered to Harvard the triple-overtime victory, 30–24, on November 19 in New Haven. The contest was the longest ever at the Bowl and in Ivy League football history. Yale led, 21–3, in the third quarter.

Dawson is the Crimsom leader in career rushing attempts (958), career rushing yards (4,241), single-season rushing yards (1,302), career rushing touchdowns (60), and single-season rushing touchdowns (20).

=== 2009 ===
On November 21, Harvard won 14–10. The contest concluded horribly for Yale head coach Tom Williams.

Yale nursed a 10–0 halftime lead to a 10–7 lead late in the fourth quarter. Then Williams, on fourth down and 22 yards to go for a first down from the Yale 26, chose to fake a punt. The attempt netted fifteen yards.

Harvard was behind 10–0 late in the fourth quarter. Harvard scored its first touchdown covering 76 yards in six plays. When Yale&#x27;s fake punt failed Collier Winter soon passed to Chris Lorditch for the winning touchdown. Moments later Harvard linebacker Jon Takamura intercepted a pass to end the game. Williams was soon released from his contract for presenting misleading information about being a candidate for a Rhodes Scholarship.

The Yale Freshmen Council loss the battle versus university administration over design of a T-shirt, approved by class-wide vote, that quoted F. Scott Fitzgerald. The T-shirt was banned that quoted the sentiment voiced by Amory Blaine from &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; that &quot;Harvard men are sissies&quot;.

=== 2014 ===
Conner Hempel completed a 35-yard touchdown pass to Andrew Fischer with 0:55 remaining in the contest and Harvard defeated Yale 31–24. Harvard won outright the football title on November 22. A Yale victory would have created a three-way tie for the League football title among Dartmouth, Harvard and Yale. Harvard led 24–7 at the end of the third quarter. Harvard finished season ranked in several Top 20 college football polls for its NCAA division.

The Emmy-winning ESPN College GameDay was broadcast from Boston. Lee Corso predicted Yale would win on the premiere college football television show. A little more than a week before the contest, Yale students protested the cost of the football program, particularly given the recent poor record.

Tyler Varga gained 127 yards on 30 carries and scored two touchdowns for Yale but Harvard completed the season undefeated and untied, the third time during Tim Murphy&#x27;s tenure.

Deon Randall for Yale and Norm Hayes for Harvard captained the teams, the first time African American athletes represented each rival at the opening coin toss. Both were voted First team All-Ivy football, Randall at receiver (for the second straight year) and Hayes at defensive back. Tim Murphy was voted Coach of the Year.

=== 2015 ===
The football game held November 21 was the first that ended after sunset at the Bowl, and was won by Harvard, 38–19. The 2:30 kickoff forced play after dusk. Harvard extended to nine games its winning streak versus Yale, the longest winning streak in the series. Harvard shared the League title, the third straight season it shared or won outright the title, another school record.

Justice Shelton-Mosley gained 119 yards, scoring two touchdowns, on five receptions, and scored on an eight-yard run from scrimmage. The first touchdown reception covered fifty-three yards, the second covered thirty-five yards. The fourth quarter eight-yard touchdown run ended his day. Shelton-Mosley was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year.

=== 2016 ===
The game played November 19 in Boston ended two streaks. Yale won, 21–14, denying Harvard its fourth consecutive shared or outright Ivy League football title, and ending Yale&#x27;s nine-game losing streak in The Game.

=== 2019 ===
Like many previous iterations of The Game, the regular season finale between Yale and Harvard had Ivy League Championship implications. Yale and Dartmouth began the day tied for the Ivy League lead, at 5–1 in conference play. Yale was ranked 25th in the national FCS coaches poll entering the game after defeating 19th ranked Princeton a week before. The first half of the 136th edition of The Game surprised odds makers with a 15-3 Harvard lead.

Halftime began at 1:40 PM, but the start of the third quarter was delayed when a small group of protesters staged a sit-in at midfield and were soon joined by more than 500 spectators, including students and alumni from Harvard and Yale. Among the causes being protested, the media coverage focused most on the calls for the two universities to divest from fossil fuel holdings and Puerto Rican debt. Play resumed a just over an hour later after security escorted out the 42 individuals who refused to leave.

For most of the second half, the Crimson had a commanding lead over the Bulldogs, including 19- and 17-point leads in the fourth quarter. With 90 seconds left in the game, a successful onside kick aided Yale in scoring two touchdowns to force overtime. Both teams scored touchdowns on their first overtime possessions. The Bulldogs started with the ball in the second overtime and quickly scored a touchdown. On the ensuing Harvard possession the Bulldogs forced the Crimson to go four and out, ending the two-overtime struggle. The 50–43 score handed Yale a share of the Ivy League Championship, their second title in three years.

The conclusion was threatened by the early sunset and the lack of lights in the 105-year-old stadium. The second half began at 2:48 PM, the sunset occurred at 4:26 PM, and the deciding Yale stop took place at 4:38 PM. The thriller game itself, along with its importance in the Ivy League standings as well as the unexpected sit-in, led observers to immediately declare it a classic, with the &quot;New Haven Register&quot;, a popular local newspaper, stating that the game, &quot;instantly took on legendary status in the annals of one of college football&#x27;s most prestigious rivalries&quot;. 

Notably, Harvard running back Aidan Borguet delivered an outstanding performance, totaling 269 rushing yards and 4 touchdowns on 11 carries. He averaged 24.5 yards per carry.

==Noteworthy pranks==
===1933===
Prior to The Game Handsome Dan II, Yale&#x27;s bulldog mascot, was kidnapped (allegedly by members of the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;); then, the morning after a 19–6 upset by Harvard over Yale, after hamburger was smeared on the feet of the statue of John Harvard that sits in front of University Hall in Harvard Yard, an image was captured of Handsome Dan licking John Harvard&#x27;s feet. The photo ran on the front page of papers throughout the country.

===1955===
Three greased pigs diverted the attention of 56,000 spectators at halftime on a snowy Saturday in New Haven. The pigs eluded tackles by groundskeepers and &quot;compiled the most yards rushing of the afternoon&quot;, reported Charles Steedman of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;. Rumor had it the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; was responsible for the exhibition of porcine football skill on the gridiron. The Crimson reported &quot;in any event it was certain [the pigs] hadn&#x27;t been playmates of Handsome Dan&quot;.

===1961===
According to &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;: &quot;In 1961, The Crimson handed out a parody of The Yale Daily News indicating that President John F. Kennedy &#x27;40 would be at the game in New Haven. At The Game, Robert Ellis Smith &#x27;62, the President of The Crimson, wore a mask of the President and walked onto the field, flanked by &#x27;Secret Service&#x27; agents as the Harvard Band played &#x27;Hail to the Chief.&#x27; Reportedly, thousands of spectators were fooled.&quot;

===1969===
Two staffers of the Harvard College paper published and distributed a mock copy of &quot;The Yale Daily News&quot;, datelined November 22, 1969. Readers were greeted with headlines &quot;Disease Strikes 16 Eli Football Starters; Bulldogs Forced to Forfeit Harvard Game&quot; and &quot;Last Year&#x27;s Stars Want to Fill in&quot;. Female cheerleaders were the alleged source of an STD rampaging through the football roster. Yale was in its first semester of coeducation.

===1983===
Several Yale students, dressed as members of the Harvard marching band, walked on to the field at halftime with the Harvard band and released a number of greased piglets on to the field.

===1992===
During the halftime show, the Harvard University Band attempted to alter the concluding &quot;H-and-Y&quot; joint formation by instead forming an &quot;X&quot; over the Yale Precision Marching Band&#x27;s &quot;Y&quot; in an effort to symbolically &quot;X out&quot; Yale. The YPMB, having become aware of the Harvard prank, instead formed an &quot;H&quot;, with the effect that the Harvard band &quot;Xed out&quot; Harvard.

===2004===
The prank at the 2004 edition of The Game was a card stunt in which Yale students, costumed as the Harvard pep squad, handed out placards to some 1,800 Harvard partisans, with instructions to hold them up after each Harvard score to spell out &quot;Go Harvard&quot;. When raised, however, the cards actually displayed &quot;WE SUCK&quot;, to the delight of the Yale students, alumni, and fans across the field. Harvard won the game, 35–3. Harvard students refused to believe eyewitnesses to the prank until video irrefutably confirmed it. The prank was featured by various print media, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot;, and MSNBC.

===MIT &quot;Hacks&quot;===

MIT has a roster of &quot;Hacks&quot; against supposed haughtiness by Harvard. Both universities are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

During the second quarter in 1982 at Harvard Stadium, a Harvard score was immediately followed by a huge black weather balloon inflating near midfield. &quot;MIT&quot; was proclaimed in painted letters on the slowly inflating balloon until it exploded, spraying powder over a few square yards of the field. Again in Harvard Stadium, MIT students secretly replaced the &quot;VE-RI-TAS&quot; insignia on the scoreboard with &quot;HU-GE-EGO&quot; in 2006.

==Little Red Flag==

The Little Red Flag is a talisman that since 1884 has been waved by Harvard&#x27;s &quot;most loyal fan&quot; after each score by Harvard against Yale. The original pennant was made of brick-red and magenta silk with an olive &quot;H&quot; stitched to one side. The original pennant was retired to a secret location when Paul Lee assumed the honor of waving a replacement after each score by Harvard.

The tradition began with Frederick Plummer, class of 1888, who attended the HarvardYale game 59 times between 1884 and his death in 1948. In 1950, when the flag appeared among the various unassigned items in Plummer&#x27;s estate, William Bentinck-Smith, then editor of the Harvard Alumni Bulletin, suggested awarding the honor of carrying the flag on the day of The Game to the Harvard man in attendance who had seen the largest number of Yale games – and for the 1951 game it was awarded to Spencer Borden, class of 1894. The succession of holders has continued consecutively with Allen Rice, Richard P. Hallowell, Douglas Hamilton, James Dwinell, Harold Sedgewick, Sam McDonnell, Burdette Johnson, William Markus, Paul Lee, and Dick Bennink honored.

<text>Ultimate Six is a seven-issue comic book limited series and crossover between Spider-Man and the Ultimates (2003), featuring the Ultimate Marvel version of the Sinister Six. The series was written by Brian Michael Bendis, penciled by Trevor Hairsine and inked by Danny Miki.

==Publication history==

The story takes place after the events shown in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #46.

==Plot summary==
Electro wakes up from his three-week coma and goes on a rampage before being confronted by Captain America, Iron Man, and Black Widow. After appearing on TV, Kraven the Hunter and his lawyer are confronted by Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Wasp, and Hawkeye to question him about his &quot;enhancements&quot;. Hawkeye prevents Kraven from running off while Wasp disables the camera run by Kraven the Hunter&#x27;s camera operator. The Ultimates detain the two villains in a maximum-security S.H.I.E.L.D. superhuman prison beneath the Triskelion along with Sandman, Doctor Octopus, and Green Goblin. As Hank Pym tries to get information from them during his interrogation on them, Nick Fury informs the five captives that they are detained because they have illegally altered their genetic code. Sharon Carter is having Kraven taken to his cell where he briefly assumes his gruesome and animalistic appearance that included fangs, claws, large muscles, big hands, and big feet before his inhibitor collar activates. Osborn is convinced that &quot;There will be six&quot; prisoners.

Pym continues his interrogation on the criminal. Osborn starts to turn into Green Goblin as Pym grows big to subdue him. Six weeks later, Pym gives a status report on his interrogation to Nick Fury and the rest of the Ultimates. Otto Octavius wants to cooperate with his captors and is granted access to a laboratory, where his metal tentacles are held. He wills his tentacles to attack and then shuts down the prison&#x27;s power, releasing the others.

Iron Man investigates the ruins where he finds Pym injured and unconscious under some rubble which does not bode well for Wasp who goes to meet up with Iron Man. Nick Fury immediately sends agents to collect Peter Parker just in case Osborn goes after him. Fury introduces him to the Ultimates, who do not believe that Spider-Man is a teenager and reminds them that he has defeated all five escapees on his own. From a secret retreat, Norman Osborn places a call to Chief of Staff Stone in regard to Nick Fury.

Norman Osborn and his fellow villains take refuge in Kingpin&#x27;s house in The Hamptons. The President chews out Nick Fury in regard to the call from Osborn who blackmails the government or he would publicize his treatment at the hands of S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury dispatches the Ultimates. After Doctor Octopus hacks into the Triskelion, the five escapees then attack the Triskelion. Nick Fury asks for the status of Bruce Banner and Magneto. A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent states that Magneto is still locked up.

S.H.I.E.L.D. takes Spider-Man&#x27;s Aunt May into protective custody while Fury and the Ultimates pick up the pieces at the Triskelion. Nick Fury is informed by Iron Man that Banner fell asleep after reading some magazines where he&#x27;ll be awake in three days and that Magneto nearly suffocated when his oxygen supply was cut off during the blackout until the back-up systems for it kicked in. The escaped villains have abducted Peter Parker who was in costume and unmasked. They tie him to a chair as Kraven assumes his animalistic form and attacks Peter for costing him his TV show and causing his wife to leave him. Otto subdues Kraven as Osborn reprimands Kraven while stating that he is the weakest of the group. Osborn then humiliates Peter by recounting the accident that created him as he claims that he and Otto were Peter&#x27;s parents in a way while calling him &quot;my boy&quot;. Osborn then tells Peter that they will attack the White House and he wants Peter to join them. Peter refuses and breaks free. Osborn then threatens Aunt May and Mary Jane if Peter does not join them. The six attack the White House, but a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier arrives on the scene.

The six and the Ultimates battle it out on the White House lawn. Captain America tells Parker that his aunt is safe and he turns on the Green Goblin. Iron Man has S.H.I.E.L.D. Control upload a genetic code sequence to his armor which enables him to do a temporary genetic paralysis on Sandman, Wasp defeats Doctor Octopus, and Thor defeats Electro while also defeating Kraven before he can attack Spider-Man in the Oval Office. Goblin attacks Captain America when his son Harry appears on the lawn asking him to stop.

While Harry talks to his father, the Ultimates bring him down. Harry tells Peter that he will kill all of them for what they did to his father. All villains are detained again and Peter Parker is reunited with his Aunt. Electro claims that he was biding his time to attack Osborn, Kraven is strapped to the bed claiming that either Doctor Octopus and Green Goblin mind-controlled him, Sandman is placed in different jars, and Doctor Octopus is told that his tentacles are in a different facility. A doctor tells Wasp the status of her husband and to inform Nick Fury of when Pym wakes from his coma. With Norman Osborn in a cryogenic chamber with half of his face in Green Goblin form, Captain America and Nick Fury talk about how the next war will be a genetic war and that the people in power decide what the wars will be fought over.

<text>OfficeMax is an American office supplies retailer founded in 1988. As an independent chain, it was the third-largest office supply retailer in the United States. Following a 2013 merger, it is currently a brand and subsidiary of Office Depot.

==History==
OfficeMax was founded in Cleveland on April 1, 1988, by Bob Hurwitz and Michael Feuer. Hurwitz served as executive chairman and chief executive officer, and Feuer was the president and chief operating officer. On July 5, 1988, OfficeMax opened its first retail store in the Golden Gate Shopping Center in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. Hurwitz left the company in 1993 and Feuer became the chairman and chief executive officer.

OfficeMax grew by acquisition with Office World first in November 1990, with Office World executive and Montgomery Ward becoming minority shareholders. In 1990, Office Square stores were purchased from Kmart, in exchange for a 22% equity stake. In 1991, Kmart increased its stake in OfficeMax to 92%. In January 1992, OfficeMax acquired five sites from Highland Superstores in Boston. OW Office Warehouse, a Virginia-based regional chain, was acquired on June 30, 1992. The company then acquired BizMart, its largest acquisition (104 stores) to date, in 1993 from Intelligent Electronics. On August 16, 1993, OfficeMax joined Kmart and most of the other Kmart-owned banners in the &quot;largest power center&quot; Kmart operated in Utica, Michigan. OfficeMax acquired a 19% stake in Corporate Express, a contract stationer. In May 1994, Kmart put a plan in front of its stockholders to sell 20% to 30% of each of its specialty store subsidiaries shares on the open market to pay down debt and fund future expansion of the subsidiaries. Kmart&#x27;s shareholders turn down the proposal at their June 3 annual meeting. In November 1994, FurnitureMax store within a store concept begins testing in the Cleveland market. In 1995, Kmart sold off 51% of OfficeMax shares, spinning off the company and became a NYSE-(OMX) publicly traded corporation, based in Shaker Heights, Ohio.

===Public corporation===
In 1995, OfficeMax became one of a handful of companies doing business through internetMCI. Around this time Kmart sold the remaining 25% of the OfficeMax shares it held. On July 14, 1996, a new kiosk program called BatteryMax was test launched in two Phoenix stores. BatteryMax were operated by Batteries for Everything.

OfficeMax also filed lawsuits for infringement for use of the &quot;Max&quot; name against Med Max and Circuit City for CarMax, its used car business. For the next few years OfficeMax and its rivals, Staples and Office Depot, continued to open new stores, saturating the market segment.

OfficeMax developed regional delivery centers, and invested in its super-regional PowerMax distribution centers in Las Vegas, Nevada, Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and Birmingham, Alabama after litigation began with previous logistics and shipping provider.

A small sized store concept, OfficeMax PDQ, test was launched in Woodmere, Ohio, in late June 1998. By 2001, the chain operated 960 stores. That year, OfficeMax began closing underperforming stores in some neighborhoods and in regions where it did not have a strong presence. In 2003, OfficeMax was acquired by Boise Cascade Corporation for $1.3 billion. The following year, the combined company split into two: its wood and paper operations were acquired by Madison Dearborn Partners, and the remaining company adopted the OfficeMax name.

In December 2012, OfficeMax operated 941 stores in 47 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Mexico; that year, net sales were $6.9 billion, down from $8.3 billion in 2008.

===Merger with Office Depot===
It was announced on February 20, 2013, that OfficeMax and Office Depot would combine in an all-stock deal, creating the largest U.S. office-supplies chain. However, as of May 2, 2013, a lawsuit filed by a stockholder, Hollander v. OfficeMax Inc et al., U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 13-3330 was filed to block the merger, which would pay all OfficeMax shareholders 2.69 shares of Office Depot in exchange for a single share in OfficeMax. Eric Hollander said in a statement &quot;OfficeMax, if properly exposed to the market for corporate control, would bring a price materially in excess of the amount offered in the proposed transaction...&quot; Office Depot said on May 5, 2013, that it would hold a special meeting with shareholders after the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission finished reviewing documents relating to its merger with OfficeMax.

The merger with Office Depot closed on November 5, 2013. On December 10, Office Depot, Inc. announced that it had chosen Boca Raton, Florida for its global headquarters post-merger, closing the OfficeMax headquarters in Naperville, Illinois.

Following the merger, the two chains integrated, though many retain the OfficeMax name. Some have since closed, while others rebranded as Office Depot following renovations. The first OfficeMax closed permanently on May 16, 2015.

===New Zealand branch closures===
On 26 August 2020, OfficeMax announced that it would be closing all 14 of its New Zealand branches and shift operations online in response to growing online usage and the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand.

<text>In the theory of 3-manifolds, a compression body is a kind of generalized handlebody.

A compression body is either a handlebody or the result of the following construction:

: Let formula_1 be a compact, closed surface (not necessarily connected). Attach 1-handles to formula_2 along formula_3.

Let formula_4 be a compression body. The negative boundary of C, denoted formula_5, is formula_6. (If formula_4 is a handlebody then formula_8.) The positive boundary of C, denoted formula_9, is formula_10 minus the negative boundary.

There is a dual construction of compression bodies starting with a surface formula_1 and attaching 2-handles to formula_6. In this case formula_9 is formula_3, and formula_5 is formula_10 minus the positive boundary.

Compression bodies often arise when manipulating Heegaard splittings.

<text>Daniel Carl Wuerffel (born May 27, 1974) is an American former football quarterback who played college football for the Florida Gators and professional football in the National Football League (NFL). At Florida, he was a prolific passer under head coach Steve Spurrier. Wuerffel led the NCAA in touchdown passes in 1995 and 1996 and set numerous school and conference records during his career. During his senior year in 1996, he won the Heisman Trophy while leading the Gators to their first national championship. In 2013, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

After graduating from the University of Florida, he was selected in the 1997 NFL draft by the New Orleans Saints. He spent six years in the league with four teams, including the Green Bay Packers, the Chicago Bears and the Washington Redskins, though his playing time and on-field success in the NFL was limited. Wuerffel also played one season in NFL Europe, where he led the Rhein Fire to a league championship in World Bowl 2000.

After retiring from professional football, Wuerffel returned to New Orleans to work with Desire Street Ministries, a nonprofit organization that seeks to help impoverished neighborhoods through spiritual and community development. Wuerffel had first become involved with the organization while playing for the Saints in the late 1990s, and as the organization attempted to recover from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he became its executive director. Under Wuerffel, Desire Street Ministries moved its headquarters to Atlanta and expanded its programs to other inner cities in the American South.

==Early life==
Wuerffel was born in Pensacola, Florida, in 1974, the son of a Lutheran minister who was a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force. While he was growing up, his family and he lived in South Carolina, Spain, Nebraska, and Colorado before he attended Fort Walton Beach High School in Fort Walton Beach, Florida.

Wuerffel was a standout high school football and basketball player for the Fort Walton Beach Vikings. In football, he led the Vikings to an undefeated season as a senior quarterback, while winning the Florida Class 4A state football championship in 1991 and earning the number two national ranking in &quot;USA Today&quot;. Wuerffel was widely considered the top high school football recruit in the state of Florida, and &quot;USA Today&quot;&#x27;s high school player of the year in Florida during his senior year. He graduated from high school as his class co-valedictorian.

==College career==
===1993–1994===
Wuerffel accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played quarterback for head coach Steve Spurrier&#x27;s Florida Gators football team from 1993 to 1996. One of the most decorated players in Florida&#x27;s football history, he was a key member of the Gators teams that won four consecutive Southeastern Conference titles between 1993 and 1996. Wuerffel graduated from the university with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in public relations, and was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a &quot;Gator Great&quot; in 2006. On September 30, 2006, Wuerffel was inducted into the Gator Football Ring of Honor alongside his former coach Spurrier and two other former Gator players, Jack Youngblood and Emmitt Smith. Wuerffel was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2013.

The 1993 season was the first in which the Gators were ranked in the AP top 10 every week. In the second week, quarterbacks Wuerffel and Terry Dean throw a total of seven interceptions against Kentucky. With eight seconds left, Wuerffel threw a pass down the middle to walk-on receiver Chris Doering for the game-winning touchdown; Gator play-by-play announcer Mick Hubert shouted, &quot;Doering&#x27;s got a touchdown!&quot; The next week, Florida recovered and defeated Heath Shuler-led and fifth-ranked Tennessee 41–34 in a &quot;shootout&quot;.

===1995–1996===

Wuerffel had split playing time with fellow quarterback Terry Dean for much of the 1993 and 1994 seasons. With Dean graduated, Wuerffel was the clear starter coming into the 1995 season, and he made the most of his opportunity. The Gators went through the regular season undefeated, and Wuerffel set several Southeastern Conference (SEC) and NCAA records for passing, including the SEC season record for touchdown passes and the NCAA record for passing efficiency . Highlights included a September win over rival Tennessee in which Florida rallied from a 30–14 deficit to win 62–37 behind Wuerffel&#x27;s SEC record 6 touchdown passes. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; had sent a team of reporters to cover the top-10 matchup and had planned to put Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning on the cover. However, after the Gators&#x27; win, they decided to put Wuerffel on the cover instead, bringing him his first major national attention.

He led the Gators to the Bowl Alliance National Championship game following the 1995 season, but ultimately lost 62–24 to the Nebraska Cornhuskers in the Fiesta Bowl. Wuerffel won the 1996 Heisman Trophy, as the outstanding college football player in America, while quarterbacking the Gators into their second consecutive Bowl Alliance national championship game with help from teammates Fred Taylor at running back; Reidel Anthony, Ike Hilliard, and Jacquez Green at wide receiver; and Jeff Mitchell on the offensive line. Wuerffel and the Gators won the 1996 national championship in decisive fashion by defeating the Florida State Seminoles 52–20 in the Sugar Bowl.

===Individual awards and honors===
Wuerffel was a first-team All-American in 1995, and a consensus first-team All-American in 1996. He received the Sammy Baugh Trophy in 1995, the Davey O&#x27;Brien Award in 1995 and 1996, and the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award in 1996, and was named the Quarterback of the Year by the Touchdown Club of Columbus in 1996. Wuerffel declined to be included on &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s All-America team as well as its Scholar-Athlete of the Year award, saying, &quot;That&#x27;s not the type of person I am or would like to portray myself as.&quot; His Gators teammates picked him as the squad&#x27;s most valuable player in 1995 and 1996; his coaches chose him as one of the Gators&#x27; team captains. He was later named to &quot;The Gainesville Sun&quot;&#x27;s Florida Gators Team of the Century in 1999, was chosen by the &quot;Sun&quot; as the number one player in the first 100 years of Gators football, and was listed as a member of the Florida Gators 100th Anniversary Team in 2006.

He is one of only two Heisman Trophy winners to also receive the Draddy Trophy, which is presented annually by the National Football Foundation and the College Football Hall of Fame to the nation&#x27;s top football scholar-athlete. Wuerffel was also a first-team Academic All-American in 1995 and 1996.

He finished his Gator career by completing 708 of 1,170 passes for 10,875 yards with 114 touchdown passes, the best in SEC history and second-most in major college history. His career pass efficiency rating of 163.56 was the best in major college history and his percentage of passes which went for a touchdown (9.74) ranked first in collegiate history. In 1995, his efficiency rating of 178.4 set a single-season collegiate record. During his Heisman-winning season of 1996, he completed 207 of 360 passes for 3,625 yards (an SEC record at the time) for 39 touchdowns (leading the nation) and his efficiency rating of 170.6 made him the first quarterback to ever post a rating of 170 or better in back-to-back years.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
Wuerffel was considered a &quot;marginal&quot; prospect for the 1997 NFL draft. As such, the New Orleans Saints selected Wuerffel in the fourth round of the 1997 NFL Draft as the third quarterback selected in the draft. He was selected to potentially serve as the number three quarterback, as the team already had Heath Shuler and Jim Everett on the roster under new head coach Mike Ditka. He played for the Saints for three seasons from to . Wuerffel spent the offseason before the 2000 NFL season with the Rhein Fire in NFL Europa, where he led the team to a league championship and was named MVP of World Bowl 2000. He spent single seasons as a backup with the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears in 2000 and 2001. Wuerffel was drafted by the Houston Texans in the 2002 NFL Expansion Draft, only to be traded to the Washington Redskins a week later, reuniting him with college coach Steve Spurrier. Wuerffel started several games that season, alternating with fellow Florida Gator alumnus Shane Matthews, but was released by the team before the 2003 season, much to the chagrin of Spurrier.

After not being signed by another team in 2003, Wuerffel decided to retire from professional football in February 2004.

==Personal life==
Wuerffel began work at Desire Street Ministries, a nonprofit, faith-based organization focusing on spiritual and community development in areas of New Orleans.

The All Sports Association of Fort Walton Beach created the Wuerffel Trophy in his honor in 2005. Florida sculptor W. Stanley Proctor created the design which commemorates Danny Wuerffel, &quot;as he prays after a touchdown. It is awarded annually by the All Sports Association of Fort Walton Beach, Florida to the athlete who best exemplifies Wuerffel&#x27;s character on the field of play and in the classroom.

In June 2011, &quot;The Gainesville Sun&quot; reported that Wuerffel was suffering from Guillain–Barré syndrome, a disorder of the nervous system, and was undergoing treatment for it.

In 2014, Emerald Bay Country Club in Destin, Florida, hosted the 1st Annual Danny Wuerffel Golf Classic, known as the &quot;Danny Cup&quot;. A small stretch of road between the Mid-Bay Bridge and Highway 98 in Destin, still his parents&#x27; home, has been dedicated as &quot;Danny Wuerffel Way&quot; by the Florida state legislature.

Wuerffel is currently a motivational speaker, executive director of Desire Street Ministries and maintains a personal website at dannywuerffel.com .

Before the Pickleball craze hit the US, Wuerffel was one of the first celebrity players trying to grow the game. In 2022, Wuerffel hosted his first Picklebowl tournament, a play on the Super Bowl, the event is a Celebrity Pro–am, where a Professional plays with celebrity from their Alma mater. In the first event ever Wuerffel and his teammate Kyle Yates, who was a former UF tennis player, won the event. Yates and Wuerffel successfully defended their Picklebowl title in 2023 in Atlanta at the Intercollegiate Tennis Association

<text>A Quonset hut is a lightweight prefabricated structure of corrugated galvanized steel with a semi-circular cross-section. The design was developed in the United States based on the Nissen hut introduced by the British during World War I. Hundreds of thousands were produced during World War II, and military surplus was sold to the public. The name comes from the site of their first deployment at Quonset Point at the Davisville Naval Construction Battalion Center in Davisville, Rhode Island.

== Design and history ==
The first Quonset huts were manufactured in 1941 when the United States Navy needed an all-purpose, lightweight building that could be shipped anywhere and assembled without skilled labor. They could be assembled in a day by a 10-person team using only hand tools.

The George A. Fuller construction company manufactured them, and the first was produced within 60 days of signing the contract. In 1946, the Great Lakes Steel Corporation claimed &quot;the term &#x27;Quonset,&#x27; as applied to builders and building materials, is a trade mark owned by the Great Lakes Steel Corporation.&quot; But the word is often used generically. Today similar structures are made by many contractors in countries around the world.

The original design was a structure framed with steel members with an radius. The most common design created a standard size of with a radius, allowing of usable floor space with optional overhangs at each end for protection of entrances from the weather. Other sizes were developed, including and warehouse models.

The sides were corrugated steel sheets, and the two ends were covered with plywood which had doors and windows. The interior was insulated and had pressed wood lining and a wood floor. The building could be placed on concrete, on pilings, or directly on the ground with a wood floor. The original design used low-grade steel, which was later replaced by a more rust-resistant version. The flexible interior space was open, allowing use as barracks, latrines, medical and dental offices, isolation wards, housing, and bakeries.

Between 150,000 and 170,000 Quonset huts were manufactured during World War II, and the military sold its surplus huts to the public after the war. Many remain standing throughout the United States as outbuildings, businesses, or even homes, and they are often seen at military museums and other places featuring World War II memorabilia. Many were also used around the United States for temporary postwar housing, such as Rodger Young Village for veterans and their families in Los Angeles, California, and the Quonset Park complex of married student housing at the University of Iowa. Some are still in active use at United States military bases. The U.S. Department of Energy continues to utilize Quonset huts as supporting structures (fabrication and machine shops, warehouses, etc.) at the Nevada National Security Site. The repurposed huts were common enough that Sherwin-Williams introduced a line of paint called &quot;Quon-Kote&quot; specifically designed to stick to the metal structures.

== In popular culture ==
After World War II, surplus Quonset huts became popular as housing in Hawaii. They became known as &quot;&quot;kamaboko&quot; houses&quot; due to their half-cylindrical shape, similar to a slab of &quot;kamaboko&quot;.

The situation comedy &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, which aired on CBS from 1964 to 1969, featured Quonset huts as the barracks housing at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California.

<text>Samuel Butman (April 30, 1788 – October 9, 1864) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Maine. A farmer and War of 1812 veteran, Butman served in the Maine State House before entering the U.S. House of Representatives, where he represented Maine&#x27;s seventh congressional district. Late in life he entered the Maine State Senate, where he served as the chamber&#x27;s president.

Butman was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, on April 30, 1788. His family moved to Dixmont in present-day Maine (then a region of Massachusetts) in 1805. There his father, an American Revolutionary War veteran, worked as a farmer.

During the War of 1812, Butman served as captain of a militia company that participated in the ill-fated Battle of Hampden. In 1820, he attended the state constitutional convention. Two years later, in 1822, he was elected to the Maine State House, and served that year and from 1826 to 1827. Butman left the state legislature to serve in the 20th and 21st Congresses (March 4, 1827 – March 3, 1831) in the U.S. House of Representatives as a representative of Maine&#x27;s seventh district.

In 1846, Butman was county commissioner of Penobscot County. He served in the State Senate and was its president in 1853. He died in Plymouth, Maine, on October 9, 1864.

<text>Philip Charles Testa (April 21, 1924 – March 15, 1981), also known as &quot;The Chicken Man&quot;, was an Italian-American mobster known for his brief leadership of the Philadelphia crime family of the Italian-American Mafia. He became boss of the Philadelphia crime family after the previous boss and his close friend, Angelo Bruno, was murdered by Bruno&#x27;s own &quot;consigliere&quot;, Antonio Caponigro, who, in turn, was ordered killed by The Commission for murdering a boss without permission.

Testa&#x27;s nickname came from his involvement in a poultry business. About a year after Bruno&#x27;s death, Testa was killed by the blast of a nail bomb at his home in South Philadelphia. The assassination was allegedly ordered by Testa’s own underboss, Peter Casella, as part of the Second Philadelphia Mafia War.

==Early life==
Testa was born to Sicilian immigrants in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and lived in South Philadelphia with his family in his teenage years. In South Philadelphia he met and befriended future mob boss Angelo Bruno. He later married Alfia Arcidiacono (records show her family owned a farm in Salem County, New Jersey). In early police dossiers on Testa, he was identified by law enforcement as not having a legitimate source of income and was solely dependent from winnings as a &quot;common gambler.&quot;

Testa and his wife had a son who also became involved in organized crime, Salvatore Testa, and was killed three years after his father.

In 1970, Testa became underboss of Angelo Bruno. When Bruno was murdered in 1980, Testa became boss, appointing Nicodemo Scarfo as &quot;consigliere&quot;.

==Death and aftermath==

One month before Testa was murdered, he, Frank Narducci Sr., Harold and Mario Riccobene, Pasquale Spirito, Joseph Ciancaglini, and several associates were indicted in a federal racketeering case that centered on gambling and loansharking operations run by the mob. The case was based on an investigation called Operation Gangplank and was one of the first built on the RICO Act by the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office in Philadelphia. On March 15, 1981, Testa returned to his home in South Philadelphia that was across the street from Stephen Girard Park. As he was opening the door to his twin home at 2117 Porter Street, a nail bomb exploded under his front porch. His death was allegedly ordered by his underboss and drug trafficker Peter Casella and capo Frank Narducci Sr., which later resulted in Narducci being gunned down and Casella being banished from the Mob and fleeing to Florida.

Testa&#x27;s murder sparked a war within the family. Nicodemo Scarfo seized the top position for himself, promoting his long time friend Chuckie Merlino as his underboss and Testa loyalist Frank Monte as his &quot;consigliere&quot;. Scarfo went on to lead the family for a decade with a bloody rampage, fueled by paranoia and aggression.

==In popular culture==
Testa&#x27;s violent death is referenced in the opening lines of musician Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s song &quot;Atlantic City&quot;. He was portrayed by Larry Romano in the film &quot;The Irishman&quot;.

<text>Ultimate War is a comic book limited series produced by Marvel Comics featuring the Ultimates and the Ultimate X-Men. The series contains four books, released between December 8, 2002 and February 23, 2003. It was written by Scottish comics author Mark Millar with art by Chris Bachalo.

It is collected as part of the &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; series of trade paperbacks. This was the first time the Ultimates as a team had crossed over with characters from the Ultimate Marvel Universe.

==Plot==

Previously, the X-Men defeated Magneto and pronounced him dead. Rather than turning Magneto over to the authorities and virtually ensuring the death penalty for him, Professor X secretly brainwashed his old friend and tried to rehabilitate him. However, the Beast inadvertently leaked this plan to Magneto&#x27;s Brotherhood, believing that he was chatting with an online girlfriend. The Brotherhood used this to entrap Beast and gained enough knowledge to free their leader.

Meanwhile, Iceman has left the X-Men, forced out by his worried parents after he sustained injuries in the fight against Proteus, while three more X-Men, Wolverine, Cyclops and Kitty Pryde, are on a mission to the Savage Land.

The US government is irate over Magneto&#x27;s reappearance and demands explanations from Nick Fury. Fury and his Ultimates track down the Xavier Mansion, whose location was hitherto unknown, and find it empty, the X-Men having relocated. Nick Fury comes to the incorrect conclusion that the X-Men have joined forces with Magneto to fight mankind.

In preparing to battle the X-Men, Captain America reveals he knows more about Wolverine; they fought together in World War II, when Logan went under the name James &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; Howlett. The X-Men&#x27;s plane returns, with only Logan and Kitty on board. Wolverine claims Cyclops has died heroically in the Savage Land. The truth, which Jean later learns, is that Wolverine tried to kill Cyclops and left him for dead so as to be with Jean.

Charles Xavier meets with Magneto to negotiate a truce, intending to use the meeting as a diversion to allow Wolverine to track down Magneto&#x27;s base. Magneto anticipates Xavier&#x27;s double-cross, tracks down the X-Men&#x27;s new base in turn, and anonymously tips off their whereabouts to the Ultimates. The Ultimates track down the X-Men and have an all-out fight.

The Ultimates nearly defeat the X-Men, who are only saved by the timely return of Iceman. All of the X-Men escape except Charles Xavier, who stays behind to delay the Ultimates and is captured by Nick Fury.

<text>USS &quot;New Ironsides&quot; was a wooden-hulled broadside ironclad built for the United States Navy during the American Civil War. The ship spent most of her career blockading the Confederate ports of Charleston, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina, in 1863–65. &quot;New Ironsides&quot; bombarded the fortifications defending Charleston in 1863 during the First and Second Battles of Charleston Harbor. At the end of 1864 and the beginning of 1865 she bombarded the defenses of Wilmington in the First and Second Battles of Fort Fisher.

Although she was struck many times by Confederate shells, gunfire never significantly damaged the ship or injured the crew. Her only casualty in combat occurred when she was struck by a spar torpedo carried by the . Eight crewmen were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in 1865. The ship was destroyed by fire in 1865 after she was placed in reserve.

==Design and description==
After the United States received word of the construction of the Confederate casemate ironclad, , Congress appropriated $1.5 million on 3 August to build one or more armored steamships. It also ordered the creation of a board to inquire into armored ships. The U.S. Navy advertised for proposals for &quot;iron-clad steam vessels of war&quot; on 7 August and Gideon Welles, the Secretary of the Navy, appointed the three members of the Ironclad Board the following day. Their task was to &quot;examine plans for the completion of iron-clad vessels&quot;. They evaluated 17 different designs, but recommended only three on 16 September.

The three ironclad ships differed substantially in design and degree of risk. The was the most innovative design by virtue of its low freeboard, shallow-draft iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had not previously been tested by any navy. Its designer John Ericsson&#x27;s guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved. The wooden-hulled &#x27;s most novel feature was her armor of interlocking iron rails. The &quot;New Ironsides&quot; was much influenced by the and was the most conservative design of the three, which copied many of the features of the French ship. The well-known Philadelphia engine-building firm of Merrick &amp; Sons made the proposal for &quot;New Ironsides&quot;, but they did not have a slipway so they subcontracted the ship to William Cramp &amp; Sons. William Cramp claimed credit for the detailed design of the ship&#x27;s hull, but the general design work was done by Merrick &amp; Sons.

&quot;New Ironsides&quot; was long between perpendiculars and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . The ship displaced , more than her designed displacement. To minimize her draft, &quot;New Ironsides&quot; was given a wide beam and a flat bottom. She had a rectangular ram that projected forward from her bow. The ship&#x27;s crew consisted of 449 officers and men.

A two-piece rudder was fitted to &quot;New Ironsides&quot;, but it proved unsatisfactory in service as the ship became more unmanageable as her speed increased. The rudder was blamed at the time, but the very full shape of the ship&#x27;s hull aft was the most likely cause as it screened the rudder from the flow of water behind the hull. The ship&#x27;s hull was coppered to reduce fouling.

===Propulsion===
&quot;New Ironsides&quot; had two simple horizontal two-cylinder direct-acting steam engines driving a single brass propeller. Steam was provided by four horizontal fire-tube boilers at a working pressure of . The engines produced which gave the ship a maximum speed around . &quot;New Ironsides&quot; carried of coal and her propeller could be disengaged to reduce drag while under sail alone. The ship was barque-rigged with three masts that were used only for long-distance voyages, and were removed, with their rigging, once on station. The best speed under sail and steam together was only about .

===Armament===

The ship&#x27;s main armament was originally going to consist of 16 smoothbore, muzzle-loading Dahlgren guns mounted on the gun deck. However, the navy was less than impressed by the performance of 9-inch Dahlgrens during the Battle of Hampton Roads and wanted more powerful guns. Accordingly, the design changed while the ship was under construction to accommodate fourteen 11-inch Dahlgren guns and two muzzle-loading , 150-pounder Parrott rifles. Two , 50-pound Dahlgren rifles were fitted on the upper deck as chase guns. They were replaced by 60-pound Dahlgren rifles by October 1864.

Each 11-inch gun weighed approximately and could fire a shell at a range of at an elevation of 15°. The muzzle-loading Parrott rifles fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The 17-caliber guns weighed each. The 50-pounder Dahlgren rifles weighed approximately . The small size of the gun ports limited the guns, however, to a maximum elevation of 4.5° which reduced their range to less than .

The existing wooden carriages for 11-inch guns were too long to fit in &quot;New Ironsides&quot;″s cramped battery. A new iron carriage was built where the gun rode in a cradle that slid on iron rails. The new carriages pivoted at the gun ports to minimize the size of the ports. Two compressors, or clamps, were fitted to squeeze the rails and increase friction between the rails and the cradle, but these were not strong enough to handle the recoil force when the gun was fired. Two more compressors were fitted as well as rope to restrain the guns, but neither was entirely satisfactory. The problem was not resolved until December 1862 when strips of ash wood were placed underneath the compressors; the friction of iron on wood was double that of iron on iron and the increased friction solved the problem.

===Armor===
&quot;New Ironsides&quot; had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was thick; below the waterline it was reduced to . It reached above the waterline and below. Above the belt the battery was protected by 4.5-inch armor, but the bow and stern were left unprotected. Although not initially part of the design, transverse bulkheads were added during construction to protect the ends of the battery. They consisted of of wrought iron backed by of white oak. The deck was three inches of yellow pine beneath of wrought iron. Mirroring French practice, the armor plates were secured to the ship&#x27;s hull and deck by countersunk screws. The armor plates were cut with a groove on each side and an iron bar was inserted between each plate to better distribute the shock of impact. The side armor was backed by of wood. A conning tower with three-inch sides was also added during construction. It was placed behind the funnel and the mainmast, and had no visibility directly forward. It was small and could only fit three people.

Each of the ship&#x27;s gun ports was protected by two armored shutters, each thick. Each shutter rotated on an axle at its top operated from inside the battery. In combat these shutters frequently cracked or broke when hit; rarely was a shutter jammed in either the open or closed position.

==Construction and career==
&quot;New Ironsides&quot; was named in honor of , which earned the nickname &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; during her engagement with in the War of 1812. As &quot;Constitution&quot; herself was still in commission, the name was unavailable for a new ship. Merrick &amp; Sons was awarded a $780,000 contract for the ship on 15 October 1861 for delivery in nine months. A $500 penalty was imposed for each day past 15 July 1862 that the ship was delayed. Commodore Charles Stewart sponsored the ship as she was launched on 10 May 1862. She was commissioned on 21 August, but the navy did not invoke the penalty for late delivery. On 27 September the navy paid Merrick &amp; Sons $34,322.06 for &quot;extras&quot;, presumably the armored bulkheads, shutters, and conning tower not included in the original specifications.

The day after &quot;New Ironsides&quot; was commissioned, she sailed for Hampton Roads where Rear Admiral Goldsborough had been requesting her since July. He feared a Confederate sortie down the James River to attack his ships and did not believe that his armored sloop &quot;Galena&quot; and the prototype ironclad &quot;Monitor&quot; would be enough. On 31 August, Secretary Welles ordered &quot;New Ironsides&quot; back to Philadelphia for post-trial repairs. Her voyage to Hampton Roads had revealed problems with her steering, gun recoil, and lack of speed. A start was made on the gun recoil problem when she was ordered to return to Hampton Roads on 23 September, but the other two problems proved to be intractable. She was kept ready to respond to a Confederate attack with steam up while mechanics were sent to fix the recoil problems and the crew was training.

&quot;New Ironsides&quot; joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Port Royal, South Carolina, on 17 January 1863. When she first arrived, the ship exchanged her masts and rigging for poles suitable for signaling. Rear Admiral Du Pont ordered that the ship&#x27;s funnel be cut down to improve the visibility from the conning tower, but the fumes from the funnel nearly asphyxiated the men in the conning tower and on the gun deck, and the funnel had to be restored. He also attempted to move the conning tower to a better position, but it was too heavy for the equipment available.

The day after the Confederate casemate ironclads and sortied and briefly captured two Union ships on 31 January, &quot;New Ironsides&quot; was ordered to patrol off Charleston Harbor. The ship remained at Charleston for the rest of the year except for brief intervals at Port Royal. She participated in the First Battle of Charleston Harbor on 7 April 1863, when nine Union ironclads entered the harbor and conducted a prolonged, but inconclusive, bombardment of Fort Sumter. &quot;New Ironsides&quot; served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Du Pont during the battle. He and his staff occupied the conning tower during the engagement, which forced the ship&#x27;s captain to command the ship from the gun deck. Admiral Du Pont&#x27;s pilot was unfamiliar with &quot;New Ironsides&quot;″ quirks, and the channel used during the attack was shallower in places than her deep draft; she maneuvered erratically and had to anchor several times to avoid going aground. The monitors and collided with &quot;New Ironsides&quot; as they attempted to move past her, but no damage was suffered by any of the ships. As the ship was withdrawing she anchored directly over a Confederate &quot;torpedo&quot; (mine) that was filled with of gunpowder that failed to detonate. During the bombardment &quot;New Ironsides&quot; fired only a single broadside, but she was hit over 50 times in return without significant damage or casualties.

&quot;New Ironsides&quot; repeatedly bombarded Confederate positions in the successful campaign to take Fort Wagner on Morris Island beginning with the Second Battle of Fort Wagner on 18 July through the next two months and the Second Battle of Charleston Harbor. During this time the ship was the target of a failed spar torpedo boat attack on 21 August. While resupplying ammunition on 8 September, &quot;New Ironsides&quot; was called to provide cover for the monitor which had grounded between Fort Sumter and Cummings Point. &quot;New Ironsides&quot; anchored in front of Fort Moultrie and forced the Confederate gunners to seek cover; she fired 483 shells and was struck at least 70 times. The ship also contributed crewmen for the landing party that unsuccessfully attempted to seize Fort Sumter on the night of 8–9 September. Between July and October &quot;New Ironsides&quot; fired 4439 rounds and was hit by at least 150 heavy projectiles, none of which inflicted any significant damage or casualties.
Another spar torpedo attack was made by the semi-submersible on the night of 5 October 1863. The attack was successful, but the damage was minor, and only one man later died of his wounds. &quot;New Ironsides&quot; remained on station until 6 June 1864 when she returned to Port Royal preparatory to a return to Philadelphia for repairs and a general overhaul. Her masts and rigging were replaced and most of the ship&#x27;s crew with time remaining on their enlistments were transferred to other ships in the squadron. The ship arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 24 June and was decommissioned six days later to begin her refit.

&quot;New Ironsides&quot; completed her overhaul in late August 1864, now under the command of Commodore William Radford, but did not join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in Hampton Roads until October when her crew finished gunnery training. She participated in a major assault in December on Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in an effort to stop blockade running into the port of Wilmington. Though this attack was called off on Christmas Day after an extensive bombardment, the Union fleet returned to resume the operation on 13 January 1865. &quot;New Ironsides&quot; was one of several warships that heavily shelled Fort Fisher, preparing the way for a ground assault that captured the position on 15 January. Afterward and for the next few months, &quot;New Ironsides&quot; supported Union activities on the James River. She was decommissioned on 6 April 1865 and was laid up at League Island, Philadelphia, where, on the night of 16 December 1865, &quot;New Ironsides&quot; was destroyed by a fire. The ship was towed to shallow water where she burned and sank. Her wreck was salvaged and her boilers were offered for sale in 1869.

<text>The Air Force Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (AFROTC) is one of the three primary commissioning sources for officers in the United States Air Force and United States Space Force, the other two being the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) and Air Force Officer Training School (OTS). A subordinate command of the Air University within the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), AFROTC is aligned under the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accessions and Citizen Development at Maxwell AFB, Alabama. The Holm Center, formerly known as the Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS), retains direct responsibility for both AFROTC and OTS.

AFROTC is the largest and oldest source of commissioned officers for the U.S. Air Force. AFROTC&#x27;s stated mission is to produce quality leaders for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force. AFROTC units are located on 145 college and university campuses with 1100+ additional institutions of higher learning participating in &quot;cross-town agreements&quot; that allow their students to attend AFROTC classes at a nearby &quot;host&quot; college or university. According to AFROTC HQ, in 2006, AFROTC commissioned 2,083 USAF Second Lieutenants, with AFROTC enrollment ranging from 23,605 in 1985 to 10,231 in 1993, and around 13,000 enrolled today.

==History==
The Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) was established with the passage of the National Defense Act of 1916, with Army ROTC established in 1916 followed by Naval ROTC in 1926. The 1916 act established program guidelines that remained in effect until 1964.

The National Defense Act of 1920 continued ROTC, and units to train aeronautically rated officers for the then-U.S. Army Air Corps were created. By 1926, seven such units existed, at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, the University of California, the University of Illinois, and the University of Washington. A lack of funds and facilities to support flight training near the colleges during the interwar period and the meager output of the programs (about fifty lieutenants a year combined) in relation to manpower requirements for the number of Air Corps Reserve units forced the units at Texas A&amp;M, Georgia Tech, and the University of Washington to cease in 1928, with the remaining units subsequently training only non-rated (i.e., ground) officers. Since the Air Corps had virtually no requirements for non-rated officers, it closed the units at Illinois in 1931, the University of California and New York University in 1932, and MIT in 1935. Air Corps officers were subsequently accessed via either the U.S. Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York or via the Aviation Cadet Program at locations in Texas, California, and Alabama. As opposed to USMA, whose graduates all received bachelor&#x27;s degrees and were commissioned as Regular Army officers, Aviation Cadets could be accessed without undergraduate college degrees and were all commissioned as Reserve officers. This remained the norm for the Army Air Corps and its successor, the U.S. Army Air Forces, through the end of World War II.

After World War II, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, as Chief of Staff of the Army, signed General Order No. 124, establishing Army Air Forces ROTC units at 78 colleges and universities throughout the nation. In September 1947, with the establishment of the U.S. Air Force as an independent service, these units became Air Force ROTC units. Administrative responsibility for Air Force ROTC was assigned to the Air University (AU) at Maxwell AFB, Alabama.

In 1971, women were admitted to the Air Force ROTC program, having been previously limited to commissioning only via Officer Training School (OTS).

Beginning in 1973, eligible Air Force enlisted men and women pursuing a college degree who were interested in becoming USAF commissioned officers were also afforded the opportunity to enroll in Air Force ROTC through competitive selection to the AFROTC Airman Scholarship and Commissioning Program (AECP). AECP replaced the former BOOTSTRAP program and provided a full AFROTC scholarship in addition to whatever Veterans Administration educational benefits these Airmen were entitled to. However, unlike BOOTSTRAP where enrollees remained on active duty and received full pay and benefits while pursuing a degree and a commission, AECP selectees were required to separate from active duty and their time spent in AECP was not creditable for accrual of active duty service.

In 1978, Air Training Command (ATC) assumed responsibility for AFROTC programs. That same year, opportunities for undergraduate pilot training were afforded to female cadets. Future astronaut, Colonel Eileen Collins, USAF (Retired) was one of the first AFROTC cadets selected for pilot training upon graduation.

On July 1, 1993, ATC merged with Air University to form the Air Education and Training Command (AETC). Air University became a direct reporting unit (DRU) under AETC and AFROTC continued to be aligned under Air University.

In February 1997, AFROTC and Officer Training School merged under a newly created parent organization, Headquarters, Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS). This restructuring placed oversight for three-quarters of Air Force officer production under one command and facilitated the sharing of manpower and expertise with minimum effect on the day-to-day operations of either organization. In June 2008, HQ AFOATS was re-designated as the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accessions and Citizen Development, merging administrative responsibility for Air Force ROTC, OTS, Air Force Junior ROTC (AFJROTC), and the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), especially the CAP Cadet Program.

In 2016, authority for CAP was transferred from AETC and the Holm Center to Air Combat Command (ACC) via 1st Air Force (1AF) / Air Forces Northern (AFNORTH) at Tyndall AFB, Florida. The relationship(s) of AFROTC, OTS and AFJROTC to AETC and the Holm Center remained unchanged.

In 2020, United States Space Force officers also began commissioning through the AFROTC program.

==Organization==
AFROTC units at colleges and universities are called &quot;detachments,&quot; and are headed by an active duty USAF officer in the rank of colonel or lieutenant colonel who functions as both the Detachment Commander for USAF purposes and with the nominal title of professor of aerospace studies (PAS) within the institution&#x27;s academic community. Most colleges and universities will designate the AFROTC detachment as the Department of Aerospace Studies. Depending on the detachment size, the PAS is typically assisted by one to four assistant professors of aerospace studies (APAS), also all active-duty USAF officers. Most APAS hold the rank of captain; however, some are also first lieutenants or majors. Approximately three USAF non-commissioned officers and one senior non-commissioned officer will typically provide military administrative support and are often augmented by one to two civilian staff support employees of the academic institution. Larger detachments may also have a Lieutenant Colonel serve as a vice commander.

Within AFROTC detachments, the students (referred to as &quot;cadets&quot;) are organized into wings, groups, squadrons, and flights, mirroring the USAF functional wing structure. The AFROTC detachment&#x27;s cadet wing or cadet group is separated into two divisions: the General Military Course (GMC) consisting of the first two years of training, and the Professional Officer Course (POC) consisting of the last two years of training. The AFROTC program is also divided into two training functions: the Academic Classroom Program (Aerospace Studies classes) and Cadet Activities (i.e., Leadership Laboratory, Physical Training, and other training).

== Aerospace Studies (AS) ==
Aerospace Studies (AS) classes are the academic portion of AFROTC. The General Military Course (GMC) is a two-year course, consisting of AS100 and AS200 cadets, designed to motivate and prepare cadets for entry into the Professional Officer Course (POC). Each AS100 and AS200 course is designed as a weekly, one academic-hour course. The POC is a two-year course, consisting of AS300 and AS400, designed to prepare cadets for active duty as Air Force officers. Each course in the POC is designed as a weekly, three academic-hour course. Specific topics covered in the AS classes are as follows:

:AS100 – Heritage and Values of the Air Force: Structure and missions of Air Force organizations, officership, and professionalism. Introduction to communication skills.

:AS200 – Team and Leadership Fundamentals: Beginnings of manned flight and the development of aerospace power from World War I to present-day current operations.

:AS300 – Leading People and Effective Communication: Anatomy of leadership, role of discipline in leadership situations, and the variable affecting leadership. Case studies and practical application in Leadership Laboratory (LLAB). The current AS300 curriculum was previously taught as the AS400 curriculum until the 1990s, when it was shifted to the junior year.

:AS400 – National Security Affairs/Preparation for Active Duty: The role of the professional military leaders in a democratic society, international developments on strategic preparedness, and active-duty assignment preparation. The National Security Studies portion of the current AS400 curriculum was previously taught as the AS300 curriculum until the 1990s, when it was shifted to the senior year.

The AS400 program previously included a single academic term Flight Instruction Program (FIP) private pilot ground school course taught by an aeronautically rated USAF officer on that AFROTC detachment&#x27;s staff. This course was mandatory for all cadets slated for undergraduate pilot training on graduation who did not already hold an FAA private pilot certificate or higher and was optional for all other cadets. AFROTC cadets who lacked an FAA private pilot&#x27;s certificate or higher initially received 38 flight hours of USAF-funded flight instruction in light aircraft from a civilian contractor near the college or university. In 1974, this was reduced to 25 flight hours, ensuring that these cadets were able to safely solo. With increasingly fewer aeronautically rated USAF officers assigned to AFROTC instructor positions and the subsequent establishment of Initial Flight Training (IFT) for all USAF 2d Lieutenants commissioned via USAFA, AFROTC, and OTS slated for undergraduate pilot training or undergraduate navigator training (now known as undergraduate combat systems officer training), FIP was eliminated from AFROTC in 1991.

== Leadership Laboratory (LLAB) ==
Leadership Laboratory (LLAB) is a weekly 2-hour pass/fail class that trains and prepares cadets for Field Training (FT), develops leadership skills, and promotes esprit de corps among all cadets. At some universities, credit hours may be given for completing LLAB; often universities only give credit hours for completing AS classes. For GMC cadets, LLAB provides new cadets with basic skills and knowledge to be a functional member of the cadet corps, prepares them in Warrior Knowledge and Drill and Ceremonies (marching), and teaches leadership, followership, and teamwork skills. For POC cadets, LLAB furthers leadership and followership skills learned at FT by planning and implementing the activities under the supervision of the active-duty cadre.

Specific LLAB activities are determined by the detachments themselves and thus vary across the nation. Some specific activities include: Field trips to Air Force bases and stations (to include Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard installations), Field Days, physical fitness tests and competitions, Drill and Ceremonies, leadership-building exercises, and Air Force officer career days.

== Scholarship programs ==
AFROTC offers a variety of highly competitive college scholarships, ranging from 3-year and 4-year scholarships offered to graduating high school seniors, 2-year and 3-year scholarships to college students enrolled as AFROTC cadets, and 2-, 3- and 4-year scholarships offered to enlisted military personnel.

AFROTC Scholarships offered to high school seniors are categorized as follows:

:Type 1: Pays full college tuition, most fees and $900 per year for books. Approximately 5 percent of AFROTC four-year scholarship winners will be offered a Type 1 scholarship, mostly in technical fields such as engineering, chemistry, meteorology, applied mathematics or computer science.

AFROTC Scholarships offered to in-college students are as follows:

:In-College Scholarship Program (ICSP): Open to college freshmen and sophomores in any major. Program is divided into two selection phases and awards-

::ICSP Phase One: Open only to students enrolled in the Air Force ROTC program. Eligible applicants are nominated for ICSP Phase One by their school’s AFROTC detachment commander. Nominees for each detachment are rank-ordered by the detachment commander based on their leadership ability, grades, fitness, and overall participation in the Air Force ROTC program. Headquarters AFROTC makes the final decision and awards scholarships. The nomination deadline is between 10 February and 28 February of each year.

All cadets selected through ICSP Phase One are awarded a Type 2 scholarship (capped at $18,000 per year for tuition, $600 per year for books).

Freshman nominees are awarded three-year scholarships and sophomore nominees are awarded two-year scholarships. All scholarships activate the following fall term.

::ICSP Phase Two: Open to college freshman and sophomores in any major. ICSP Phase One nonselects and students not enrolled in Air Force ROTC are eligible to apply for ICSP Phase Two. Eligible applicants are nominated for ICSP Phase Two by the commander of the detachment serving the school where they attend or the school where they will attend once they join Air Force ROTC. Students not currently enrolled in Air Force ROTC must be interviewed by the detachment commander or his/her designee. The deadline for detachments to submit a nomination is 30 June. The board meets in July, and those selected are typically notified by 1 August of each year.

A limited number of cadets selected through ICSP Phase Two are awarded a Type 2 scholarship (capped at $18,000 per year for tuition, $600 per year for books). Most scholarship selected students are awarded a Type 3 scholarship (capped at $9,000 per year for tuition and $600 per year for books).

Freshmen nominees are awarded three-year scholarships, and sophomore nominees are awarded two-year scholarships. All scholarships activate the fall term following their distribution.

:ICSP Phase Three: Depending on officer production and funding, a limited number of qualified sophomore ICSP Phase Two nonselects may be offered Type 6 scholarships. This process takes place at the same time ICSP Phase Two results are released.

:Express Scholarship: Designed to meet Air Force ROTC officer production requirements in specific fields and year groups. This program awards Type 1 scholarships paying full college tuition, most fees and $600 per year for books. In many cases, these scholarships can activate during the same term as nomination. The Express Scholarship program is operated on a fully qualified basis. Those students who meet the qualifications are awarded the scholarship and do not meet a scholarship selection board. The processing of the scholarship award is completed at the local AFROTC detachment. Eligible majors are Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering and Meteorology.

:Express Scholarship (Foreign Language): Designed to meet Air Force ROTC officer production requirements in specific fields and year groups. This program awards Type 1 scholarships paying full college tuition, most fees and $600 per year for books. In many cases, these scholarships can activate during the same term as nomination. The Express Scholarship (Foreign Language) program is operated on a fully qualified basis. Those students who meet the qualifications are awarded the scholarship and do not meet a scholarship selection board. The processing of the scholarship award is completed at the local AFROTC detachment. Eligible majors are: Arabic, Azerbaijani, Bengali, Cambodian, Chinese, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Kasakh, Kurdish, Malay, Pashtu, Persian-Iranian/Persian-Afghan, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Swahili, Thai, Turkish, Uighur, Urdu/Punjabi, Uzbek and Vietnamese. Most candidates will eventually become USAF officers in the Intelligence career field.

Charles McGee Leadership Award (CMLA): This 2 year scholarship offers the same benefits of a Type 2 scholarship. Unlike the ISCP, this scholarship is unique in being offered to all qualified cadets who are not already on scholarship. New POC who satisfactorily complete Field Training will be offered the scholarship alongside their contract as a POC. This award can also be converted into a $10,000 per academic year &quot;Housing Scholarship&quot; that can be used to pay for on-campus housing.

AFROTC Scholarships offered to enlisted military personnel are as follows:

Airman Scholarship and Commissioning Program (ASCP): Successor program to the former BOOTSTRAP Program and Airman Education and Commissioning Program (AECP). ASCP permits active duty USAF airmen and junior non-commissioned officers to separate from active duty and receive a scholarship worth up to $18,000 per year while pursuing their commission through Air Force ROTC.

Professional Officer Course – Early Release Program (POC-ERP): Offers active duty Air Force enlisted personnel an opportunity for an early release from active duty to enter AFROTC and receive a commission as an Air Force officer. Members selected for POC-ERP will separate from active duty, sign a contract with AFROTC and become full-time college students. This program is open to undergraduate degrees only and cannot be used for postgraduate degrees. Upon completion of all undergraduate degree and commissioning requirements, cadets are commissioned as second lieutenants and returned to active duty in USAF for a period of at least four years, with longer service commitments required for those selected for flight training. POC-ERP is open to all academic majors. While in AFROTC, individuals will no longer receive military pay or benefits. All members applying for POC-ERP are required to provide proof that they have the financial means to make it through the program. Enlisted personnel selected for POC-ERP may use their Montgomery GI Bill benefits while in the program along with any additional grants or scholarships for which they may qualify.

Scholarships for Outstanding Airman to ROTC (SOAR): The SOAR program allows USAF enlisted personnel to separate from active duty and receive a scholarship worth up to $18,000 per year while pursuing their commission through AFROTC. Students may not pay the difference to attend higher-cost schools.

Nurse Enlisted Commissioning Program (NECP): The Nurse Enlisted Commissioning Program (NECP) offers active duty Air Force enlisted personnel the opportunity to earn a commission while completing their bachelor&#x27;s degree in nursing. NECP students graduate, take the NCLEX, and then attend COT. Students will attend COT upon completion of their bachelor&#x27;s degree and this will be their commissioning source. Those selected for NECP remain on active duty and are administratively assigned to an Air Force ROTC detachment. Their duty is to attend school as a full-time college student. NECP cadets may participate in the program for up to 24 consecutive months, depending on prior academic preparation and age limitations. During the program, they attend school year-round to include summer terms.

== Cadet organization ==
AFROTC classifies cadets into the following basic categories of training with respect to Field Training attendance and commissioning:

:Basic Cadet (BC): Cadets who are part of the GMC but are not scheduled to attend FT the following summer. Normally AS100 cadets.

:Basic Cadet Leader (BCL): Cadets scheduled to attend FT in the upcoming summer. Normally AS200 cadets, or if dual-enrolled in AS100 and AS200 classes, AS250 cadets.

:Intermediate Cadet Leader (ICL): Cadets who have successfully completed FT but are not scheduled to commission in the upcoming year. Normally AS300 cadets.

:Senior Cadet Leader (SCL): Cadets who have satisfactorily completed FT and are scheduled to be commissioned in the upcoming year. Normally AS400 cadets.

:Extended Cadet Leader (ECL): Cadets who have completed the AFROTC curriculum but need additional time to complete their academic degree, such as 5-year engineering program students. Normally AS700 cadets or, if on scholarship, AS800 cadets.

Note, in September, 2024 Initial Military Training (IMT) and Field Training Preparation (FTP) were reclassified as Basic Cadet (BC) and Basic Cadet Leader (BCL), respectively.

A Cadet who has completed the first two years of academic classes but did not pass Field Training or attain a FT slot is an AS500 cadet.

Detachments organize cadets after the active-duty wing structure to the best of their ability, compensating for variable sizes and circumstances. GMC cadets participate as the underclassmen while the POC cadets participate as the upperclassmen. POC cadets have completed Field Training and are assigned leadership positions in the corps. Cadets are classified and assigned rank commensurate with their position and level of responsibility within the cadet wing and with respect to FT completion.

=== General Military Course ===
General Military Course cadets (formerly Cadet Airmen) are all cadets who have not satisfactorily completed Field Training. AS100 BC cadets hold the Cadet Fourth Class (C/4C) rank while AS200 BCL cadets hold Cadet Third Class Rank (C/3C). GMC cadets are not committed to joining the Air Force unless on AFROTC scholarship. If contracted, AS100 cadets receive a monthly tax-free stipend of $300 while AS200 cadets receive $350.

GMC cadets on contract are also considered to be inactive enlisted members in the Obilgated Reserve Section (ORS) of the Air Force Reserve serving without pay. Their Air Force Reserve enlisted ranks will range from Airman Basic (AB, pay grade E-1) to Staff Sergeant (SSgt, pay grade E-5) with higher grades based on prior enlisted military experience in the Active Component or Reserve Component of the U.S. armed forces or other qualifying credentials (i.e., senior Civil Air Patrol cadets or former high school AFJROTC cadets with four years of participation enlisting at Airman First Class {A1C, E-3}, etc.).

=== Professional Officer Course ===
Professional Officer Course cadets (formerly Cadet Officers), AS300 (ICL), AS400 (SCL), and AS700 (ECL), are cadets who have satisfactorily completed Field Training or have received a Field Training deferment. POC cadets wear cadet officer rank (Cadet Second Lieutenant (C/2d Lt) – Cadet Colonel (C/Col)). Unlike the Air Force Academy, for juniors and seniors there is no rank of Cadet Second Class or Cadet First Class, respectively. With some exceptions, all POC cadets are considered to be &quot;on contract&quot; and are committed to being commissioned as officers in the Air Force or Space Force upon completion of their academic degree.

Like GMC cadets on contract, POC cadets are considered to be inactive enlisted members of the Air Force Reserve, serving without pay between the grades of E-1 and E-5, with said enlisted status terminating upon commissioning. However, POC cadets are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and thus in strictly legal cases (such as sexual assault occurring within the cadet corps) they are considered as &quot;civilians.&quot; As contracted cadets, AS300 cadets also receive a monthly tax-free stipend of $450 and AS400 cadets receive $500. POC cadets are required to meet USAF height and weight standards, pass the USAF Fitness Assessment (FA) each academic semester, and meet a minimum cumulative and term GPA requirement of 2.5. Repeatedly failing to meet any of these standards may result in disenrollment from AFROTC. All POC cadets must also hold at least one leadership position within the cadet wing or group as designated by the detachment cadre&#x27;s Commandant of Cadets (COC).

In some cases, students with academic requirements that exceed four years (typically engineers and other technical majors in five-year programs) continue the AFROTC program for additional semesters as needed. During these additional years these cadets (AS700 or AS800, if on scholarship) are only minimally required to participate in LLAB and maintain retention standards. It is important to note that this is not the case for schools with co-op programs that entail a total of four years of classes and one year of cooperative experience. In these cases the cadets are classified as AS300&#x27;s their first POC year and AS400&#x27;s their second and third POC years. The cadets will not attend aerospace classes, Physical Training, or Leadership Lab during their co-op blocks (they will be on Periods of Non-Attendance) and otherwise complete the program like any four-year major.

=== Cadet Wing ===
The cadet wing (cadet group at smaller detachments) is organized to mirror the active-duty objective wing structure and is composed entirely of AFROTC cadets. Cadet rank is determined by the positions and levels of responsibility in which they hold. Cadet wings strive to include positions similar to those found in active-duty wings but additional positions may be added at the discretion of the detachment cadre&#x27;s COC. Each wing is headed by a Cadet Colonel and has subsequent groups, squadrons, and flights. POC cadets rotate positions each semester and cannot hold the same position for two consecutive periods without approval. POC cadets are required to serve at least one term in a leadership position. Leadership positions include wing, group, squadron, and flight positions and others named by the CW/CC.

== Physical Training (PT) ==

Cadets are required to take part in Physical Training (PT) at least twice per week each semester. Whether PT is counted as a school credit or not, attendance at PT (at least 80 percent) is required to pass Leadership Laboratory (LLAB). As a prerequisite, cadets must have a certified DoD physical or a sports physical on file at the detachment and must complete an AFROTC Physical Health Screening Questionnaire. Before the beginning of exercises, cadets receive a safety briefing on the &quot;importance of hydration, heat stress disorders, and prompt reporting of any problems to a cadre member.&quot;

Under the supervision of qualified cadre, the PT program is organized and led by AS300 and AS400 cadets. PT activities at detachments may vary from sports games, Field Training Preparation training exercises, cardio and muscular strength exercises. PT sessions usually begin by forming up as a Wing and stretching.

The Fitness Assessment (FA) is taken by each cadet each semester and is formatted after the active-duty Air Force&#x27;s FA. The FA is the primary instrument for evaluating the fitness level of each cadet. It is structured to assess the muscular endurance of specific muscle groups and the functional capacity of the cardiovascular system. Contracted cadets (i.e. those on scholarship/receiving stipend) must pass the FA. Contracted cadets that fail the FA are subject to discipline. Two consecutive failures can result in dismissal from the program. Non-contracted cadets must attempt the FA each semester. Within 72 hours of taking the FA, cadets have their height, waist, and weight measured to calculate body mass index (BMI). The FA consists of the BMI measurement, one minute of push-ups, one minute of sit-ups, and a 1.5-mile run. Maximum points for each area is 20 for BMI, 10 for push-ups, 10 for crunches, and 60 for the 1.5 mile run. To pass the FA, cadets must obtain a composite score of at least 75 and meet the minimum score requirements in each category.

== Field Training (FT) ==
Field Training is a training program that takes place the summer before cadets enter the POC. Completion of this boot camp-style training is a mandatory program for all individuals qualified to pursue an Air Force commission through AFROTC. All FTP cadets compete among each other nationwide during the spring semester to receive an EA (Enrollment Allocation), which allows them to progress to FT. Cadets who express interest in the Space Force will compete on a separate board for a Space Force EA. Cadets compete based on their Grade Point Average, Physical Fitness Assessment scores, and their ranking among other cadets in their class, as determined by the detachment commander. The number of EAs awarded is determined each year by the needs of the Air Force.

2008 marked the first year that all AFROTC Field Training Units (FTU) were held at the Officer Training School complex at Maxwell AFB, Alabama. This move reflects the Air Force&#x27;s greater emphasis on expeditionary operations in combat zone and the Joint Force Training Center (JFTC) at Camp Shelby, Mississippi.

The Field Training program is designed to evaluate military leadership and discipline, determine the cadet&#x27;s potential for entry into the Professional Officer Course (POC), and to stratify cadets amongst their peers. In-Garrison (11 days), and Vigilant Warrior is currently 3 days long, however the length may change depending on the year. FT is split up into two sections: In-Garrison (located at Maxwell AFB) and Air Expeditionary Force (located at the Vigilant Warrior Training Center near Titus, Alabama). The In-Garrison portion focuses on academics and drill &amp; ceremonies, while AEF part focuses on Expeditionary Skills Training (EST) and deployment, respectively. With FT 2023, cadets with a Space Force EA will participate in Space Force specific training.

Field Training is commanded by an active duty USAF Colonel and a staff of approximately 55 active duty USAF officers, non-commissioned officers, and cadet training assistants (CTA). Active duty FT staff are typically selected from cadre at AFROTC detachments and serve in four to six-week rotations. &quot;CTAs are POC cadets selected, based on their FT performance and overall cadet record, to return to Field Training as assistants to active duty staff members.&quot; There is one Flight Training Officer, one Non-Commissioned Officer, and one CTA assigned to each flight. In addition to flight CTAs, there are also traditional CTAs (who focus on Drill &amp; Ceremonies, Physical Training, Public Affairs, and Standardization).

The 2020 Field Training period will have two Field Training Units (FTUs) instead of three, meaning staff will serve for three Field Trainings (also known as Maxwells or Maxes) instead of two.

In recent years, Field Training has been shortened in order to provide more time for Professional Development Training, also known as PDT, for activities such as base visits, internships, and other cadet development opportunities. While normally a two-week event, FT 2023 marked a 17-day program that includes PDT or incentive flights for selected cadets—giving insight into the daily operations of an AFSC.

In each flight, cadets are ranked from first to last. The top 10% earn the distinction of &quot;Distinguished Graduate&quot;. The rest of the cadets are ranked in one of three divisions in their respective flight: top, middle, or bottom third. Various other awards are given for excelling at physical fitness and warrior spirit.

Cadets&#x27; rankings depend on the following criteria:
* Preparation for Field Training
* Fitness Assessment (FA)
* Leadership skills
* Professional qualities
* Communication skills
* Judgment/decision-making skills
* Warrior Ethos

Only the active duty officers evaluate and stratify the cadets. CTAs often give input but do not officially evaluate cadets. Cadets who are ranked among the top third or better in their flight are recommended for CTA duty and have the option to apply to become CTAs the following year.

FT 2023 marked the first year of the first Space Force Field Training graduates.

== Career / Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) selection ==

=== General AFSCs ===
Prior to Field Training, AS200 Cadets will express preference in Air Force or Space Force career fields. Most cadets will apply for their initial AFSC career field towards the middle of their second semester in their AS 300 (junior) year. AFROTC cadets can apply for various career fields, to include aeronautically rated Pilot, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), Navigator/Combat Systems Officer and Air Battle Manager (ABM) slots, as well as non-rated slots such as Missile Operations or Missile Maintenance, Space Operations, Intelligence, Aircraft Maintenance, Meteorology, Civil Engineering, Security Forces, Admin/Personnel, etc. Cadets will be notified of their prospective AFSCs during the following semester, typically from as early as late August or as late as mid-September. The eventual duty station/ base of assignment for these various AFSCs will not be determined until midway through their final year in school.
=== Rated candidates ===
Cadets applying for rated slots, such as Pilot, RPA Pilot (MQ-9 Reaper), Navigator / Combat Systems Officer (CSO), and Air Battle Manager (ABM), will have the opportunity to apply no later than towards the end of the first semester of their second-to-last year (generally, the 1st semester of the academic junior year). These candidates will also be notified of their alternate AFSC (i.e., Intel, Space, Missiles, etc.) at the same time as all other cadets who applied for non-rated AFSCs. However, before candidates are eligible to apply for aeronautically rated positions, they must be medically qualified for their selection. There are different medical standards for pilots, nav/CSOs, and ABMs, respectively, with undergraduate pilot training medical requirements, primarily uncorrected eyesight, being the most stringent. Like OTS candidates, all AFROTC cadets must take the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) prior to going on contract and must pass prior to commissioning. The Pilot Candidate Selection Method rating is a component of the Order of Merit, which allows the USAF to rank-order every single pilot candidate in AFROTC, and determine who gets what undergraduate pilot training (UPT) slot. While percentages are dictated by the AFROTC commander, the overall score consists of:

:AFOQT Scores — The AFOQT contains Pilot and Navigator sections for prospective pilots and navs/CSOs.
:Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS) — Computerized test to determine candidate pilot aptitude.

:Flight Hours — No flight hours are required, but higher flight hours result in higher scores up to 41 hours. This includes FAA-certified simulator hours.

Once the requirements are met for application, the candidates can apply at this time for specific flight training options at the following Air Education and Training Command (AETC) locations:

Pilots can opt for Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) with the 80th Flying Training Wing (80 FTW) at Sheppard AFB, Texas, which will take the top 9-10% of the pilot candidates that wish to pursue ENJJPT in lieu of traditional Specialized UPT (SUPT). ENJJPT selection is based solely off the Order of Merit scores and rank-order.

SUPT options include the 14th Flying Training Wing (14 FTW) at Columbus AFB, Mississippi; the 47th Flying Training Wing (47 FTW) at Laughlin AFB, Texas; and the 71st Flying Training Wing (71 FTW) at Vance AFB, Oklahoma.

A final pilot training option is the rotary-wing and tilt-rotor track via Undergraduate Helicopter Pilot Training (UHT) with the 23d Flying Training Squadron (23 FTS) at Fort Novosel, Alabama.

Combat Systems Officers, formerly known as Navigators, will receive their undergraduate CSO flight training with AETC&#x27;s 479th Flying Training Group (479 FTG), a tenant USAF organization at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.

Aeronautically rated candidates will be notified of their rated selection or denial during their second semester of their junior year. Base assignments, including ENJJPT assignment, will be given midway through their first semester of the last year in college. Those cadets who were selected for rated slots are then allowed to wear a flight suit during specified LLABs where the Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP) is the Uniform of the Day, unless otherwise noted by the Cadet Wing Commander or Cadet Group Commander. Once selected, pilot-selected cadets will contract with the USAF for 10 years of active duty USAF service following completion of flight training, nav/CSO-selected and ABM-selected cadets will contract for 6 years of active duty following flight training, while cadets in all other AFSCs will contract for four years after commissioning.

Pilot candidates also undergo a Flying Class I physical and navigator/CSO candidates a Flying Class IA physical during the first semester of their last year. These are the most stringent physical exams given by the USAF. ABM candidates will undergo a Flying Class III physical exam. If a cadet with a rated slot is unable to pass their flight physical, they will instead be assigned to a non-rated career field.

==== Flight Indoctrination Program (FIP) ====

Prior to 1991, AFROTC also conducted a Flight Instruction Program (FIP) parallel to the Pilot Indoctrination Program (PIP) at USAFA. Although often touted as a means for AFROTC cadets to earn a free FAA Private Pilot Certificate while in college, the actual intent of the program was to provide an additional flight training screening process for prospective USAF pilot candidates who had no prior flight experience.

In AFROTC, FIP consisted of two blocks, the first being a private pilot ground school course taught by an aeronautically rated USAF officer assigned to the AFROTC detachment&#x27;s cadre. The ground school course was also given an AS400 series designation and open to all AFROTC cadets in their senior year regardless of selection or non-selection for USAF undergraduate pilot training. Cadets who had prior civilian flight training and/or civilian pilot certifications could also enroll in the FIP ground school and the course was also offered as option for Army ROTC cadets, Naval ROTC (NROTC) midshipmen on both Navy and Marine Corps commissioning tracks, Naval Aviation Reserve Officer Candidates (AVROC) and Marine Corps Platoon Leaders Class-Air (Marine PLC-Air) officer candidates slated for flight training in their respective services following graduation.

The flying portion of FIP was typically conducted by civilian instructors under USAF contract at a nearby civilian airport, normally employing light general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna 150 / Cessna 152 series, Cessna 172, Piper Cherokee, or other similar aircraft. Since FIP was designed as a washout/attrition device, AFROTC cadets who already held an FAA Private Pilot&#x27;s Certificate or greater were not eligible for any actual flight time via FIP. Those cadets without prior flight experience initially received 38 flight hours, but post-Vietnam War defense cutbacks in the mid-1970s resulted in FIP being reduced to a &quot;safe for solo&quot; program with 25 hours of funded flight time. FIP was discontinued in 1991 when it was replaced by the single-site Enhanced Flight Screening Program (EFSP) at Hondo, Texas.

==== Initial Flight Training (IFT) and Navigator Introductory Flight Training (NIFT) ====

With the demise of FIP and PIP in 1991, the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) at Randolph AFB, Texas initially assumed responsibility for the Enhanced Flight Screening Program (EFSP) of all candidates for UPT from all USAF commissioning sources (AFROTC, USAFA and OTS). This training was conducted for these officers following graduation and commissioning at Hondo Municipal Airport, Texas in T-41 Mescalero and T-3 Firefly aircraft until 1998. Following several fatal mishaps with the T-3 Firefly, the program was transferred from the 12 FTW to a civilian contract operation under AETC auspices at Pueblo Memorial Airport, Colorado.

The Pueblo program employs civilian Diamond DA-20 aircraft and is officially known as Initial Flight Training (IFT) for USAF specialized undergraduate pilot trainees and Navigator Introductory Flight Training (NIFT) for USAF specialized undergraduate navigator/CSO trainees.

<doc id="1240788" wikidata="Q7765757" url="?curid=1240788" title="The Speckless Sky">
<text>The Speckless Sky is an album by Jane Siberry. It was Siberry&#x27;s highest-charting album on the Canadian charts and contains her biggest Top 40 hit, &quot;One More Colour&quot;. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Map of the World (Part II)&quot;, was also a hit on Canada&#x27;s adult contemporary charts.

Rheostatics recorded a cover of &quot;One More Colour&quot;, with additional lyrics by Martin Tielli, on their 1995 album &quot;Introducing Happiness&quot;; Siberry and Tielli recorded a duet, &quot;A Long Time Love Song&quot;, on the 1991 Bruce Cockburn tribute album &quot;Kick at the Darkness&quot;. Sarah Polley also performed a cover of &quot;One More Colour&quot; in the film &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;.

After this album, Siberry&#x27;s work was distributed outside of Canada by Reprise Records.

Shawn Colvin based lyrics for her song &quot;Kill The Messenger&quot; on the cover art for this album after seeing Siberry perform live.

&quot;The Speckless Sky&quot; is no longer available on CD, but can be obtained via her store site on Bandcamp.

==Reception==

<doc id="1240806" wikidata="Q2505845" url="?curid=1240806" title="Texas State Highway Loop 360">
<text>Loop 360 is a loop route in Austin in the U.S. state of Texas. Loop 360, also known as the Capital of Texas Highway, is a scenic highway winding through the hills of West Austin. The road is described by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) as &quot;a 4-lane depressed median arterial with at-grade signalized intersections&quot;. In 2021, the average daily traffic was 58,497 vehicles at the most traveled point, north of RM 2222.

==History==
Loop 360 was designated on March 29, 1962, on its current route from US 290 to US 183. On September 30, 1969, Loop 360 was extended north to Loop 1. On April 25, 1996, the section from US 183 to Loop 1 was canceled and removed from the state highway system. The south section of Loop 360 from US 290 to RM 2244 was opened on February 11, 1970. The last section of roadway for Loop 360 (excepting the bridge) between RM 2244 and FM 2222 was approved on September 30, 1976. The north and south sections of Loop 360 were connected when the Pennybacker Bridge was opened for traffic on December 3, 1982. On February 19, 1980, the Travis County commissioners voted to designate it the &quot;Capital of Texas Highway&quot;.

On July 14, 2004, the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO) changed segments of the future designation to a toll road, despite popular outcry. However, toll conversion of the road is unfunded so plans to toll Loop 360 are delayed indefinitely and there remains substantial opposition to any toll conversion of the road from residents and environmentalists. CAMPO has begun to reexamine the toll roll designation. The road should remain tollless for at least the near future. On December 6, 2006, the &quot;Mobility Alternatives Finance Study&quot; final report, commissioned by the City of Austin and other central Texas municipalities, noted the poor financial feasibility of toll conversion by stating &quot;Loop 360&#x27;s toll revenue funds the smallest share of its construction cost (7%)&quot; given a construction cost of $741 million with revenue bonds backed by future tolling of Loop 360 contributing just $51.8 million (in 2006 dollars).

===Historical markers===
There are three historical markers along Loop 360:
*&quot;The Johnson Smokehouse&quot; marker is at the entrance to the Woods of Westlake Heights subdivision, just south of Westbank Drive. The marker commemorates the Johnson Ranch. Charles Johnson, a native of Sweden, procured the original 124 acre (0.5 km2) ranch on the south side of present-day Loop 360 in 1867. The smokehouse beside the marker was relocated from the original ranch house site. According to the marker, the smokehouse was painstakingly catalogued, stone by stone, disassembled and restored to its original state.&quot; The smokehouse&#x27;s tin roof is built with tin salvaged from the temporary Texas capitol building, which burned down in 1899.
*The &quot;Eanes-Marshall Ranch&quot; marker is at the Loop 360 entrance to Saint John Neumann Catholic Church. Alexander Eanes (1806–1888) acquired the property for the ranch by 1857. Alexander later sold the ranch to his brother, Robert Eanes (1805–1895) after the Civil War. Robert sold the ranch to his son-in-law, Hudson Boatner Marshall (1862–1951) in 1883. A log cabin built on the ranch was the first Eanes school and the surrounding community assumed the Eanes name.
*The &quot;Balcones Fault Aids Colonization of Texas&quot; historical marker is north of Bull Creek on the west side of Loop 360. It commemorates the role that the Balcones Fault played in the Anglo-American settlement of Texas.

== Route description ==

The road runs roughly north–south, arcing slightly out to the west. Listing the major intersections going south to north, Loop 360 begins at US 290/SH 71, then crosses Loop 1 (Mopac Expressway), then crosses RM 2244 (a.k.a. Bee Cave Road), then bridges the Colorado River at the Pennybacker Bridge, then crosses RM 2222, then terminates at US 183. The entire length of Loop 360 is . An extension of to connect the northern end of Loop 360 with Loop 1 was once considered part of the Loop, but has since been removed from the state highway system.

The segment of Loop 360 south of US 183 is designated a scenic roadway by the City of Austin.

The road is popular with cyclists because of the road&#x27;s hills, wide shoulders for biking, and bike access across the Pennybacker Bridge. Because of the hilly terrain on the east side of the road, with right timing and clear weather, a traveler on loop 360 in early morning can enjoy multiple sunrise scenes; the most spectacular of which can be seen from the Pennybacker Bridge over Lake Austin.

The road has rock cut-throughs as well as steep fills and has steep roadway grades, 6% to 7% in some areas.

The road cuts through environmentally sensitive watersheds. It bridges Barton Creek just south of Loop 1 and runs along the east side of the Barton Creek Greenbelt. Northward, it passes to the west of Wild Basin Wilderness Preserve. Just after the Wild Basin entrance, drivers and bikers can pull into a scenic vista and take in a view of downtown Austin including the state capitol building and University of Texas Tower. Further north, Loop 360 crosses the Colorado River and enters the Bull Creek Watershed and crosses Bull Creek.

Land use restrictions along Loop 360 help preserve Loop 360&#x27;s Hill Country aesthetic.

== Proposed modifications ==

In an attempt to alleviate traffic along Loop 360 TxDOT has considered turning the road into a toll road, making it a highway with an overpass or adding Michigan left turns. The latter is favored by TxDOT but opposed by nearby residents.

<doc id="1240807" wikidata="Q6785146" url="?curid=1240807" title="Master of Advanced Studies">
<text>A Master of Advanced Studies (MASt or MAS), or Master of Advanced Study, is a postgraduate degree awarded in various countries. Master of Advanced Studies programs may be non-consecutive programs tailored for &quot;specific groups of working professionals with well-defined needs for advanced degree work&quot; or advanced research degrees. With the exception of the several schools in the UK, advanced studies programs tend to be interdisciplinary and tend to be focused toward meeting the needs of professionals rather than academics.
The Master of Advanced Studies is also often referred as Executive Master because it is aimed at working professionals (see the LSE in the UK programs for example or INSEAD and HEC programs in France)

== United Kingdom ==
The University of Cambridge began offering the Master of Advanced Study in 2010 as a one-year master&#x27;s degree in Mathematics as a replacement for the &quot;Part III exam in Mathematics&quot;. Cambridge currently offers Master of Advanced Study degrees in four fields of study. The University of Warwick has approved the introduction of a Master of Advanced Study (MASt) degree in Mathematics for the 2013/2014 year.

== United States ==
In the United States, the Master of Advanced Study or the Master of Advanced Studies degree is a post-graduate professional degree issued by numerous academic institutions, but most notably by the University of California. M.A.S. programs tend to &quot;concentrate on a set of coordinated coursework with culminating projects or papers rather than emphasizing student research&quot; and frequently are structured as interdisciplinary offerings.

== France and francophone countries ==

A master of advanced studies exists in France: &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;études supérieures spécialisées&quot; (DESA). It is not to be confused with the Diplôme d&#x27;études approfondies or DEA (equivalent to Master 2 in France and a MPhil in the UK) program and the French MBA and Mastère which titles are not accredited by the State in France.

It confers a higher qualification credential than a Master of Philosophy or Master of Studies but lower than old doctorate prior to European Higher Education Area (EHEA), however equivalent to new (EHEA) doctoral degree. The so-called &quot;DEA&quot; was achieved in two years: one year of coursework, which included research methods and theoretical approaches of the discipline at stake (depending on the area of specialization) and one year of research. All the work of the first and second years was defended before a panel. The DEA was for the elaboration of the old PhD proposal and the commencement or a prerequisite of PhD research in Spain before European Higher Education Area (EHEA) and Bologna process.

==European Union==
Students of the College of Europe (an independent university institute of postgraduate European studies with its campuses in Bruges (Belgium) and Natolin (Poland) receive an advanced master&#x27;s degree (formerly called Diploma and Certificat) following a one-year intense programme.

<text>Mutulu Shakur (born Jeral Wayne Williams; August 8, 1950 – July 7, 2023) was an African American activist, and a member of the Black Liberation Army who was sentenced to sixty years in prison for his involvement in a 1981 robbery of a Brinks armored truck in which a guard and two police officers were murdered.

Shakur was politically active as a teen with the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM) and later the black separatist movement the Republic of New Afrika. He was the stepfather of rapper Tupac Shakur.

Shakur was paroled after serving nearly 37 years of imprisonment, and died about eight months later.

==Early life and activism==
Shakur was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on August 8, 1950, as Jeral Wayne Williams. At age seven, he moved to Jamaica, Queens, New York City, with his mother, who was blind, and younger sister.

By his late teens, Shakur was politically active with the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM) and later joined the Republic of New Afrika.

In 1970, Shakur began working with the Lincoln Detox program, which offered drug rehabilitation for heroin addiction using acupuncture — instead of the FDA-approved drug methadone. Eventually, he became the program&#x27;s assistant director and remained associated with the program until 1978. He became certified and licensed to practice acupuncture in the state of California in 1979. He went on to help found and direct the Black Acupuncture Advisory Association of North America (BAAANA) and the Harlem Institute of Acupuncture.

==Brink&#x27;s robbery, arrest, and incarceration==
Shakur was one of several Black Liberation Army members to carry out the October 1981 robbery of an armored car in Nanuet, New York. Aided by the May 19 Communist Organization and former members of the Weather Underground, the BLA crew stole $1.6 million in cash from a Brink&#x27;s vehicle at the Nanuet Mall. The robbers killed Brink&#x27;s guard Peter Paige and seriously wounded another, Joseph Trombino. Soon after, they killed Nyack, New York police officers Edward O&#x27;Grady and Waverly Brown, who had stopped a getaway vehicle. 

Shakur, the alleged ringleader of the group, evaded capture for more than five years and thus was the last one to go on trial on charges related to the robbery. In 1982, Shakur, Marilyn Buck, and others involved in the BLA and M19CO were indicted on Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) charges, encompassing the Brink&#x27;s robbery and other similar robberies, as well as engineering the 1979 escape from a New Jersey prison of Assata Shakur. While at large, on July 23, 1982, he became the 380th person added to the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. 

He was arrested on February 12, 1986, in California by the FBI. An order for Shakur&#x27;s release on pretrial bail was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Shakur and Buck were tried in 1987 and convicted on May 11, 1988. He received a 60-year sentence. The convictions and sentence were upheld on appeal.

Although federal parole was abolished in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Shakur&#x27;s convictions were exempt because the Act&#x27;s provisions did not apply to crimes committed before November 1987. Under the rules in effect at the time of his offenses, Shakur was due for a mandatory parole determination after serving thirty of his original sixty-year sentence, which came in 2016. 

However, the United States Parole Commission denied his release in 2016, 2018, and early 2022. In October 2019, Shakur renewed his quest for a reduction of sentence by applying to the sentencing court for compassionate release under the First Step Act, but relief was once again denied. 

On November 10, 2022, the Parole Commission reconsidered his case and granted Shakur release on parole effective December 16, 2022, in light of his declining health. Shakur was freed on that date from Federal Medical Center, Lexington, and died about eight months later.

==Personal life==
In 1975, he married Afeni Shakur, the mother of Tupac. They had a daughter, Sekyiwa. They divorced in 1982.

In June 2022, it was revealed that Shakur had terminal bone marrow cancer with &quot;six months to live&quot;. He died from the disease on July 7, 2023, at age 72, about eight months after being paroled.

<text>Maurice Shakur (né Harding; August 16, 1967), better known by his stage name Mopreme Shakur, originally known as Wycked, is an American rapper. He was a member of the hip-hop group Thug Life and is the stepbrother of rapper Tupac Shakur. He was also a member of the Outlawz (under the name Komani), but later dropped out because of a financial disagreement with Death Row Records.

==Career==
Mopreme made his recording debut as Mocedes on Tony Toni Toné&#x27;s 1990 single &quot;Feels Good&quot;. He appeared with his stepbrother Tupac on &quot;Papa&#x27;z Song&quot;, a single from the 1993 album &quot;Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.&quot;, credited as &#x27;Wycked&#x27;.

Mopreme and Tupac formed the group Thug Life in 1993, with Big Syke, Macadoshis, and Rated R. The group released one album, &quot;Thug Life: Volume 1&quot; (1994), which went gold. Mopreme wrote many of the songs on this album. He was also an original member of Outlawz, but dropped out of the group.

In 2007, he released a mixtape with Assassin, &quot;Black &amp; Brown Pride&quot;. He performed on the soundtrack for the feature film &quot;Intoxicating&quot;, starring Kirk Harris, John Savage, and Eric Roberts. In 2008, Mopreme was a consulting producer for an episode about his father on the BET series &quot;American Gangster&quot;. In 2024 it was announched that Mopreme is Executive Producing the upcoming biopic &quot;Van Gogh&quot;, an artist who was a source of inspiration for his brother Tupac. The script was written by Kira Madallo Sesay, who is also a producer on the film. 

==Media appearances==
In October 2024, Shakur appeared on &quot;Piers Morgan Uncensored&quot; to discuss his family&#x27;s renewed investigation into the 1996 murder of Tupac. In the interview, Morgan continually pressed Shakur on whether there was credibility in the widely held belief that Sean Combs, aka &quot;P. Diddy&quot; - arrested in September 2024 on racketeering and sex trafficking charges - was in some way involved in Tupac&#x27;s murder in New York nearly three decades earlier. While acknowledging the multiple rumors of Diddy&#x27;s complicity, Shakur neither affirmed nor denied them, but stated that the Shakur family had recently hired notable lawyer Alex Spiro, who has represented high-profile clients such as Elon Musk and Jay-Z. Morgan asked Shakur whether the recent charges filed against Diddy were a catalyst for re-opening his brother&#x27;s murder case. Shakur stated that Spiro was hired months before Diddy&#x27;s arrest, and that his family has suffered immeasurably for so long that all they want is to &quot;get to the truth&quot; so that they can finally have some closure.

<doc id="1240827" wikidata="Q7773278" url="?curid=1240827" title="The Walking">
<text>The Walking is the fourth studio album by Jane Siberry. The album was released on Reprise Records internationally, but remained on the independent label Duke Street Records in Canada.

==Critical reception ==

The album was initially poorly received by critics. It largely turned its back on the quirky new wave pop that Siberry had been known for; in its place was a surreal amalgam of progressive rock and Laurie Anderson-style performance art narratives, only one of which was shorter than six minutes.

Toronto progressive radio station CFNY, an early champion of Siberry&#x27;s music, announced that it did not view any track on &quot;The Walking&quot; as viable for airplay on their station. Sales of the album were slow at first, although they improved when Siberry provided radio stations with a shorter edit of &quot;Ingrid and the Footman&quot;.

With the benefit of passing time, the Allmusic review by Sean Carruthers does a little bit of belated justice to the caliber of composition and performance of this recording: &quot;It&#x27;s her most accomplished work to date, but it&#x27;s bound to lose the casual listener quickly.&quot;

<text>&quot;The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank&quot; is episode 88 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on February 23, 1962 on CBS.

==Opening narration==
==Plot== 
In the mid-1920s in a small rural town in the &quot;southernmost section of the Midwest,&quot; a man, Jeff Myrtlebank, returns to life at his own funeral, causing the grievers to flee the church. The townspeople believe that the man must be possessed by a &quot;haint&quot; (a ghost or demon), even though the town doctor declares it was more than likely a medical condition that imitated death; his heart stopped days prior after fighting influenza. Jeff seems normal enough, yet he has changed: he has suddenly become a hard worker with exceptional strength, yet consistently eats less since his return.

The townsfolk and doctor discuss it further, where the doctor reveals that Jeff&#x27;s heart had completely stopped, and that he neither reacted to a pinprick nor fogged a mirror with his breath. Everyone seems as interested in what transpired during the days Jeff was dead as in how he came back to life.

When he goes to visit his girlfriend Comfort, he takes a bouquet of roses, but they are all dead by the time he gives them to her. Afraid, Comfort will not let him touch her after she sees them. As he leaves, her older brother confronts him and tells him to never come back, and they fight. Jeff defeats him readily, punching him in his jaw. This is the first time that Jeff has ever done so, after losing many past fights, and that gains Comfort&#x27;s sympathy.

After the fight, the townsfolk gather and start saying they need to take care of this evil amongst them. Comfort races off to warn Jeff and to avow her love for him. He proposes to her, but before she can respond to his proposal, angry townspeople arrive to confront the demon they believe is possessing Jeff. They demand that he leave. He insists that Comfort answer his proposal first, and she tells him yes, and that she is willing to go anywhere to be with him. Jeff then makes an inspired speech in which he tells them that they are wrong and have nothing to fear from him. He also slyly threatens that if they are right, it might be in their best interests to be nice to him. They nervously accept the wisdom of this, and promise to attend Jeff and Comfort&#x27;s wedding.

After the mob disperses, Comfort asks Jeff if he could really do the things he threatened them with, to which he replies that he was lying. As he speaks, he pulls out a pipe and a match, which lights by itself. When Comfort asks how he lit the match, he laughs and claims she is imagining things. He puts his arm around her shoulders to take her inside. As they walk toward the house, the fence gate closes behind them on its own.

<text>Kawakawa is a small town in the Bay of Islands area of the Northland Region of New Zealand. Kawakawa developed as a service town when coal was found there in the 1860s, but coal mining ceased in the early 20th century. The economy is now based on farming. The town is named after the kawakawa shrub.

==History==
In 1859, Maihi Paraone Kawiti petitioned Governor Thomas Gore Browne for European settlers to establish a town in the area. Browne was pleased at Kawiti&#x27;s offer but preferred for Kerikeri to be developed instead. Two years later, coal was discovered and after tests found it to be of the highest quality the government purchased from local Māori. The town of Kawakawa was built around the coal mines A horse-drawn tramway was opened in 1868 to carry coal from the mines to the Taumarere wharf. In 1871 two steam locomotives were acquired and the tramway was upgraded to railway standard. In 1884 a railway line from Kawakawa to Opua was opened, and this replaced the line to Taumarere wharf. The area was a location for the late 19th/early 20th century kauri gum digging trade.

By 1899 there were over 300 residents in the town, which was built mainly on the hillside near the coalmine. In March 1899 a fire destroyed many of the buildings. The town was rebuilt on the flat, alongside the railway tracks. The present railway station was opened in 1911 on the line to Moerewa, at the junction with the mine branch.

A railway line south to Whangārei was completed in 1911. Coal mining ceased at Kawakawa in the early 20th century due to the mines flooding. Since the closure the main economic activities are farming and tourism.

The Bay of Islands County headquarters were in Kawakawa until the county was disestablished in 1989.
==Demographics==
Kawakawa covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Kawakawa had a population of 1,482 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 18 people (1.2%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 267 people (22.0%) since the 2013 census. There were 729 males, 750 females and 6 people of other genders in 465 dwellings. 2.0% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 34.2 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 363 people (24.5%) aged under 15 years, 276 (18.6%) aged 15 to 29, 660 (44.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 177 (11.9%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 45.3% European (Pākehā), 71.1% Māori, 6.9% Pasifika, 5.7% Asian, and 1.2% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 96.2%, Māori language by 26.9%, Samoan by 0.8%, and other languages by 6.7%. No language could be spoken by 1.8% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.4%. The percentage of people born overseas was 10.7, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 32.2% Christian, 2.0% Hindu, 1.0% Islam, 5.7% Māori religious beliefs, 0.2% New Age, 0.2% Jewish, and 1.4% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 52.2%, and 5.9% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 120 (10.7%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 663 (59.2%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 306 (27.3%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $33,000, compared with $41,500 nationally. 48 people (4.3%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 549 (49.1%) people were employed full-time, 132 (11.8%) were part-time, and 78 (7.0%) were unemployed.

==Features==
The town is known as &quot;Train Town&quot;, because the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway runs down the middle of its main street on the former Opua Branch railway line. of the track reopened in 2008. Pou Herenga Tai – Twin Coast Cycle Trail follows part of the railway.

The town is also famous for its Hundertwasser toilet block, designed by Austrian artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser, who was a resident of the town from 1975 until his death in 2000.

The Kawiti glowworm caves at nearby Waiomio are also an attraction.
===Marae===
Kawakawa has four marae affiliated with hapū of Ngāpuhi, all based approximately 5 km south of the township in Waiomio. Mohinui Marae and its Hohourongo meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Hine and Ngāti Kahu o Torongare. Kawiti Marae and Te Tawai Riri Maihi Kawiti meeting house, Miria Marae and Te Rapunga meeting house and Te Kotahitanga and its meeting house of the same name are also connected to Ngāti Hine.

In October 2020, the Government committed $297,133 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Mohinui Marae, creating 3 jobs. It also committed $168,084 to upgrade Miria Marae, creating 14 jobs.
== Education ==
Kawakawa Primary School is a full primary (years 1–8) school with a roll of students.

Bay of Islands College is a secondary (years 9–13) school with a roll of students. It takes students from around the Bay of Islands and middle Northland, with 85% of its students travelling daily by bus to attend.

<doc id="1240836" wikidata="Q7701527" url="?curid=1240836" title="Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy">
<text>In physics, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a spectroscopic technique in which the properties of matter are probed with short pulses of terahertz radiation. The generation and detection scheme is sensitive to the sample&#x27;s effect on both the amplitude and the phase of the terahertz radiation. 

== Explanation ==
Typically, an ultrashort pulsed laser is used in the terahertz pulse generation process. In the use of low-temperature grown GaAs as an antenna, the ultrashort pulse creates charge carriers that are accelerated to create the terahertz pulse. In the use of non-linear crystals as a source, a high-intensity ultrashort pulse produces THz radiation from the crystal. A single terahertz pulse can contain frequency components covering much of the terahertz range, often from 0.05 to 4 THz, though the use of an air plasma can yield frequency components up to 40 THz. After THz pulse generation, the pulse is directed by optical techniques, focused through a sample, then measured.

THz-TDS requires generation of an ultrafast (thus, large bandwidth) terahertz pulse from an even faster femtosecond optical pulse, typically from a Ti-sapphire laser. That optical pulse is first split to provide a probe pulse whose path length is adjusted using an optical delay line. The probe pulse strobes the detector that is sensitive to the electric field of the resulting terahertz signal &quot;at the time of&quot; the optical probe pulse sent to it. By varying the path length traversed by the probe pulse, the test signal is thereby measured as a function of time—the same principle as a sampling oscilloscope (technically, the measurement obtains the convolution of the test signal and the time-domain response of the strobed detector). To obtain the resulting frequency domain response using the Fourier transform, the measurement must cover each point in time (delay-line offset) of the resulting test pulse. The response of a test sample can be calibrated by dividing its spectrum so obtained by the spectrum of the terahertz pulse obtained with the sample removed, for instance.

==Components ==
Components of a typical THz-TDS instrument, as illustrated in the figure, include an infrared laser, optical beamsplitters, beam steering mirrors, delay stages, a terahertz generator, terahertz beam focusing and collimating optics like parabolic mirrors, and detector.

Constructing a THz-TDS experiment using low temperature grown GaAs (LT-GaAs) based antennas requires a laser whose photon energy exceeds the band gap of the material. Ti:sapphire lasers tuned to around 800 nm, matching the energy gap in LT-GaAs, are ideal as they can generate optical pulses as short as 10 fs. These lasers are available as commercial, turnkey systems.

===Steering mirrors===
Silver-coated mirrors are optimum for use as steering mirrors for infrared pulses around 800 nm. Their reflectivity is higher than gold and much higher than aluminum at that wavelength.

===Beamsplitters===
A beamsplitter is used to divide a single ultrashort optical pulse into two separate beams. A 50/50 beamsplitter is often used, supplying equal optical power to the terahertz generator and detector, though it is common to provide the terahertz generation path with more power given the inefficiency of the terahertz generation process compared to the detection efficiency of infrared (typically 800 nm wavelength) light.

===Delay stage ===
An optical delay-line is implemented using a movable stage to vary the path length of one of the two beam paths. A delay stage uses a moving retroreflector to redirect the beam along a well-defined output path but following a delay. Movement of the stage holding the retroreflector corresponds to an adjustment of path length and consequently the time at which the terahertz detector is gated relative to the source terahertz pulse.

===Purge box===
A purge box is typically used so that absorption of THz radiation by gaseous water molecules is minimized. A dry air source is often used for this purpose, however, a nitrogen gas source may also be used.

Water is known to have many discrete absorptions in the THz region that are rotational modes of water molecules. Alternatively, nitrogen, as a diatomic molecule, has no electric dipole moment, and does not (for the purposes of typical THz-TDS) absorb THz radiation. Thus, a purge box may be filled with nitrogen gas so no unintended discrete absorptions in the THz frequency range occur.

===Parabolic mirrors===
Off-axis parabolic mirrors are commonly used to collimate and focus THz radiation. Radiation from an effective point source, such as from a low-temperature gallium arsenide (LT-GaAs) antenna (active region ~5 μm) incident on an off-axis parabolic mirror becomes collimated, while collimated radiation incident on a parabolic mirror is focused to a point (see diagram). Terahertz radiation can thus be manipulated spatially using optical components such as metal-coated mirrors as well as lenses made from materials that are transparent at THz wavelengths. Samples for spectroscopy are commonly placed at a focus where the terahertz beam is most concentrated.

== Uses of THz radiation ==
THz radiation has several distinct advantages for use in spectroscopy. Many materials are transparent at terahertz wavelengths, and this radiation is safe for biological tissue being non-ionizing (as opposed to X-rays). Many interesting materials have unique spectral fingerprints in the terahertz range that may be used for identification. Demonstrated examples include several different types of explosives, dynamic fingerprinting of DNA and protein molecules using polarization varying anisotropic terahertz microspectroscopy, polymorphic forms of many compounds used as active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) in commercial medications as well as several illegal narcotic substances.

Since many materials are transparent to THz radiation, underlying materials can be accessed through visually opaque intervening layers.

Though not strictly a spectroscopic technique, the ultrashort width of THz radiation pulses allows for measurements (e.g., thickness, density, defect location) on difficult-to-probe materials like foam. These measurement capabilities share many similarities to those of pulsed ultrasonic systems as the depth of buried structures can be inferred through timing of their reflections of these short terahertz pulses.

==THz generation==
There are three widely used techniques for generating terahertz pulses, all based on ultrashort pulses from titanium-sapphire lasers or mode-locked fiber lasers.

===Surface emitters===
When an ultra-short (100 femtoseconds or shorter) optical pulse illuminates a semiconductor and its wavelength (energy) is above the energy band-gap of the material, it photogenerates mobile carriers. Most carriers are generated near the surface of the material (typically within 1 micrometre) because pulses are absorbed exponentially with respect to depth. This has two main effects. Firstly, it generates a band bending that has the effect of accelerating carriers of different signs in opposite directions (normal to the surface), creating a dipole. This effect is known as surface field emission. Secondly, the presence of a surface creates a break of symmetry that causes carriers to move (on average) only into the bulk of the semiconductor. This phenomenon, combined with the difference of mobilities of electrons and holes, also produces a dipole. This is known as the photo-Dember effect and is particularly strong in high-mobility semiconductors such as indium arsenide.

===Photoconductive emitters===

When generating THz radiation via a photoconductive emitter, an ultrafast pulse (typically 100 femtoseconds or shorter) creates charge carriers (electron-hole pairs) in a semiconductor material. This incident laser pulse abruptly changes the antenna from an insulating state into a conducting state. Due to an electric bias applied across the antenna, a sudden electric current transmits across the antenna. This changing current lasts for about a picosecond, and thus emits terahertz radiation since the Fourier transform of a picosecond length signal will contain THz components.

Typically the two antenna electrodes are patterned on a low temperature gallium arsenide (LT-GaAs), semi-insulating gallium arsenide (SI-GaAs), or other semiconductor (such as InP) substrate.
In a commonly used scheme, the electrodes are formed into the shape of a simple dipole antenna with a gap of a few micrometers and have a bias voltage up to 40 V between them. The ultrafast laser pulse must have a wavelength that is short enough to excite electrons across the bandgap of the semiconductor substrate. This scheme is suitable for illumination with a Ti:sapphire oscillator laser with photon energies of 1.55 eV and pulse energies of about 10 nJ. For use with amplified Ti:sapphire lasers with pulse energies of about 1 mJ, the electrode gap can be increased to several centimeters with a bias voltage of up to 200 kV.

More recent advances towards cost-efficient and compact THz-TDS systems are based on mode-locked fiber laser sources emitting at a center wavelength of 1550 nm. Therefore, the photoconductive emitters must be based on semiconductor materials with smaller band gaps of approximately 0.74 eV such as Fe-doped indium gallium arsenide or indium gallium arsenide/indium aluminum arsenide heterostructures.

The short duration of THz pulses generated (typically ~2 ps) are primarily due to the rapid rise of the photo-induced current in the semiconductor and short carrier lifetime semiconductor materials (e.g., LT-GaAs). This current may persist for only a few hundred femtoseconds to several nanoseconds depending on the substrate material. This is not the only means of generation but is currently () the most common.

Pulses produced by this method have average power levels on the order of several tens of microwatts. The peak power during pulses can be many orders of magnitude higher due to the low duty cycle of mostly &gt;1%, which is dependent on the repetition rate of the laser source. The maximum bandwidth of the resulting THz pulse is primarily limited by the duration of the laser pulse, while the frequency position of the maximum of the Fourier spectrum is determined by the carrier lifetime of the semiconductor.

===Optical rectification===

In optical rectification, a high-intensity ultrashort laser pulse passes through a transparent crystal material that emits a terahertz pulse without any applied voltages. It is a nonlinear-optical process, where an appropriate crystal material is quickly electrically polarized at high optical intensities. This changing electrical polarization emits terahertz radiation.

Because of the high laser intensities that are necessary, this technique is mostly used with amplified Ti:sapphire lasers. Typical crystal materials are zinc telluride, gallium phosphide, and gallium selenide.

The bandwidth of pulses generated by optical rectification is limited by the laser pulse duration, terahertz absorption in the crystal material, the thickness of the crystal, and a mismatch between the propagation speed of the laser pulse and the terahertz pulse inside the crystal. Typically, a thicker crystal will generate higher intensities, but lower THz frequencies. With this technique, it is possible to boost the generated frequencies to 40 THz (7.5 μm) or higher, although 2 THz (150 μm) is more commonly used since it requires less complex optical setups.

==THz detection==
The electrical field of terahertz pulses is measured in a detector simultaneously illuminated with an ultrashort laser pulse. Two common detection schemes are used in THz-TDS: photoconductive sampling and electro-optical sampling. The power of THz pulses can be detected by bolometers (heat detectors cooled to liquid-helium temperatures), but since bolometers can only measure the total energy of a terahertz pulse rather than its electric field over time, they are unsuitable for THz-TDS.

Because the measurement technique is coherent, it naturally rejects incoherent radiation. Additionally, because the time slice of the measurement is extremely narrow, the noise contribution to the measurement is extremely low.

The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the resulting time-domain waveform depends on experimental conditions (e.g., averaging time). However due to the coherent sampling techniques described, high S/N values (&gt;70 dB) are routinely observed with 1 minute averaging times.

===Downmixing===

The original problem responsible for the &quot;Terahertz gap&quot; (the colloquial term for the lack of techniques in the THz frequency range) was that electronics routinely have limited operation at frequencies at and above 1012 Hz. Two experimental parameters make such measurement possible in THz-TDS with LT-GaAs antennas: the femtosecond “gating” pulses and the &lt; 1 ps lifetimes of the charge carriers in the antenna (effectively determining the antenna&#x27;s “on” time). When all optical path lengths have fixed length, an effective dc current results at the detection electronics due to their low time resolution. Picosecond time resolution does not come from fast electronic or optical techniques, but from the ability to adjust optical path lengths on the micrometer (μm) scale. To measure a particular segment of a THz pulse, the optical path lengths are fixed and the (effective dc) current at the detector due to the particular segment of electric field of the THz pulse.

THz-TDS measurements are typically not single-shot measurements.

===Photoconductive detection===
Photoconductive detection is similar to photoconductive generation. Here, the voltage bias across the antenna leads is generated by the electric field of the THz pulse focused onto the antenna, rather than some external generation. The THz electric field drives current across the antenna leads, which is usually amplified with a low-bandwidth amplifier. This amplified current is the measured parameter that corresponds to the THz field strength. Again, the carriers in the semiconductor substrate have an extremely short lifetime. Thus, the THz electric field strength is only sampled for an extremely narrow slice (femtoseconds) of the entire electric field waveform.

===Electro-optical sampling===
The materials used for generation of terahertz radiation by optical rectification can also be used for its detection by using the Pockels effect, where particular crystalline materials become birefringent in the presence of an electric field. The birefringence caused by the electric field of a terahertz pulse leads to a change in the optical polarization of the detection pulse, proportional to the terahertz electric-field strength. With the help of polarizers and photodiodes, this polarization change is measured.

As with the generation, the bandwidth of the detection is dependent on the laser pulse duration, material properties, and crystal thickness.

The sensitivity of THz-TDS detection via electro-optical sampling can be enhanced beyond the classical shot noise limit through the use of squeezed light generated by an optical parametric amplifier.

==Advantages ==
THz-TDS measures the electric field of a pulse and not just the power. Thus, THz-TDS measures both the amplitude and phase information of the frequency components it contains. In contrast, measuring only the power at each frequency is essentially a photon counting technique; information regarding the phase of the light is not obtained. Thus, the waveform is not uniquely determined by such a power measurement.

Even when measuring only the power reflected from a sample, the complex optical response constant of the material can be obtained. This is so because the complex nature of an optical constant is not arbitrary. The real and imaginary parts of an optical constant are related by the Kramers–Kronig relations. There is a difficulty in applying the Kramers-Kronig relations as written, because information about the sample (reflected power, for example) must be obtained at all frequencies. In practice, far separated frequency regions do not have significant influence on each other, and reasonable limiting conditions can be applied at high and low frequency, outside of the measured range.

THz-TDS, in contrast, does not require use of Kramers-Kronig relations. By measuring the electric field of a THz pulse in the time-domain, the amplitude and phase of each frequency component of the THz pulse are known (in contrast to the single piece of information known by a power measurement). Thus the real and imaginary parts of an optical constant can be known at every frequency within the usable bandwidth of a THz pulse, without need of frequencies outside the usable bandwidth or Kramers-Kronig relations.

<text>The whistling ducks or tree ducks are a subfamily, Dendrocygninae, of the duck, goose and swan family of birds, Anatidae. In other taxonomic schemes, they are considered a separate family, Dendrocygnidae. Some taxonomists list only one genus, Dendrocygna, which contains eight living species, and one undescribed extinct species from Aitutaki of the Cook Islands, but other taxonomists also list the white-backed duck (&quot;Thalassornis leuconotus&quot;) under the subfamily.

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
Whistling ducks were first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1758: the black-bellied whistling duck (then &quot;Anas autumnalis&quot;) and the West Indian whistling duck (then &quot;Anas arborea&quot;). In 1837, William Swainson named the genus &quot;Dendrocygna&quot; to distinguish whistling ducks from the other waterfowl. The type species was listed as the wandering whistling duck (&quot;D. arcuata&quot;), formerly named by Thomas Horsfield as &quot;Anas arcuata&quot;.

Whistling duck taxonomy, including that of the entire order Anseriformes, is complicated and disputed. Under a traditional classification proposed by ornithologist Jean Théodore Delacour based on morphological and behavioral traits, whistling ducks belong to the tribe Dendrocygnini under the family Anatidae and subfamily Anserinae. Following the revisions by ornithologist Paul Johnsgard, Dendrocygnini includes the genus &quot;Thalassornis&quot; (the white-backed duck) under this system.

In 1997, Bradley C. Livezey proposed that &quot;Dendrocygna&quot; were a separate lineage from Anserinae, placing it and its tribe in its own subfamily, Dendrocygninae. Alternatively Charles Sibley and Jon Edward Ahlquist recommended placing &quot;Dendrocygna&quot; in its own family, Dendrocygnidae, which includes the genus &quot;Thalassornis&quot;.

=== Species ===
Eight species of whistling duck are currently recognized in the genus &quot;Dendrocygna&quot;. However, Johnsgard considers the white-backed duck (&quot;Thalassornis leuconotus&quot;) from Africa and Madagascar to be distinct ninth species, a view first proposed in 1960 and initially supported by behavioral similarities. Later, similarities in anatomy, duckling vocalizations, and feather proteins gave additional support. Molecular analysis in 2009 also suggested that the white-backed duck was nested within the whistling duck clade. In addition to the species, subfossil remains of an extinct, undescribed species have been found on Aitutaki of the Cook Islands.








== Description ==
Whistling ducks are found in the tropics and subtropics. As their name implies, they have distinctive whistling calls.

The whistling ducks have long legs and necks, and are very gregarious, flying to and from night-time roosts in large flocks. Both sexes have the same plumage, and all have a hunched appearance and black underwings in flight.

After breeding and pairing with a female, male whistling ducks (especially within the Fulvous whistling duck species) will often help with the construction of nests and will take turns with the female incubating the eggs.

<doc id="1240842" wikidata="Q4683190" url="?curid=1240842" title="Adjunction space">
<text>In mathematics, an adjunction space (or attaching space) is a common construction in topology where one topological space is attached or &quot;glued&quot; onto another. Specifically, let formula_1 and formula_2 be topological spaces, and let formula_3 be a subspace of formula_2. Let formula_5 be a continuous map (called the attaching map). One forms the adjunction space formula_6 (sometimes also written as formula_7) by taking the disjoint union of formula_1 and formula_2 and identifying formula_10 with formula_11 for all formula_10 in formula_3. Formally,

:formula_14

where the equivalence relation formula_15 is generated by formula_16 for all formula_10 in formula_3, and the quotient is given the quotient topology. As a set, formula_6 consists of the disjoint union of formula_1 and (formula_21). The topology, however, is specified by the quotient construction. 

Intuitively, one may think of formula_2 as being glued onto formula_1 via the map formula_24.

==Examples==
*A common example of an adjunction space is given when &quot;Y&quot; is a closed &quot;n&quot;-ball (or &quot;cell&quot;) and &quot;A&quot; is the boundary of the ball, the (&quot;n&quot;−1)-sphere. Inductively attaching cells along their spherical boundaries to this space results in an example of a CW complex.
*Adjunction spaces are also used to define connected sums of manifolds. Here, one first removes open balls from &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; before attaching the boundaries of the removed balls along an attaching map.
*If &quot;A&quot; is a space with one point then the adjunction is the wedge sum of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.
*If &quot;X&quot; is a space with one point then the adjunction is the quotient &quot;Y&quot;/&quot;A&quot;.

==Properties==
The continuous maps &quot;h&quot; : &quot;X&quot; ∪&quot;f&quot; &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; are in 1-1 correspondence with the pairs of continuous maps &quot;h&quot;&quot;X&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;h&quot;&quot;Y&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; that satisfy &quot;h&quot;&quot;X&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;))=&quot;h&quot;&quot;Y&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;.

In the case where &quot;A&quot; is a closed subspace of &quot;Y&quot; one can show that the map &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; ∪&quot;f&quot; &quot;Y&quot; is a closed embedding and (&quot;Y&quot; − &quot;A&quot;) → &quot;X&quot; ∪&quot;f&quot; &quot;Y&quot; is an open embedding.

==Categorical description==
The attaching construction is an example of a pushout in the category of topological spaces. That is to say, the adjunction space is universal with respect to the following commutative diagram:

Here &quot;i&quot; is the inclusion map and &quot;Φ&quot;&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Φ&quot;&quot;Y&quot; are the maps obtained by composing the quotient map with the canonical injections into the disjoint union of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. One can form a more general pushout by replacing &quot;i&quot; with an arbitrary continuous map &quot;g&quot;—the construction is similar. Conversely, if &quot;f&quot; is also an inclusion the attaching construction is to simply glue &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; together along their common subspace.

<text>The variable platyfish (Xiphophorus variatus), also known as variatus platy or variegated platy, is a species of freshwater fish in family Poecilidae of order Cyprinodontiformes. A livebearer, it is native to southern Tamaulipas and northern Veracruz states in northeastern Mexico. It is a popular fish in the aquarium trade due to its prolific breeding, as are hybrids with other members of its genus, most notably the southern platyfish.

==Description==
The variable platyfish grows to a maximum overall length of 7.0 cm (2.8 in). In the wild, they are olive in colour with black marbling or spots on the side of the caudal peduncle. Large males show blackish blotches on the dorsal fin. Unlike some other members of the genus, &quot;X. variatus&quot; has no claw at the tip of the fifth anal fin ray. The fourth pectoral ray shows well-developed serrae (saw-like notches). They typically have 20 to 24 lateral scales, 10 to 12 dorsal rays and two rows of jaw teeth. Males exhibit a more pointed or &quot;needle-like&quot; anal fin whereas the female have a more triangular anal fin.

==Range and habitat==
The variable platyfish is endemic to the Atlantic slope of Mexico from southern Tamaulipas south to northern Veracruz. It is considered uncommon across its range. The species has also been introduced and become established in a number of locales, largely due to releases related to the aquariums trade. In the United States, they have been established in canals along the eastern shore of Tampa Bay, Florida, as well as in Gainesville. They are also naturalised in springs in the counties of Beaverhead, Granite and Madison in Montana. The species has been spread to a number of other countries outside of its range, including Colombia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, the latter of which reports a negative impact on native species due to its prodigious breeding.

The fish&#x27;s habitats include slow-moving waters of vegetated canals, ditches, and warm springs. Omnivorous, its diet includes both plants and small crustaceans, insects, and annelid worms.

==Aquarium trade==
The variable platyfish is bred commercially for the aquarium hobby. It is popular due to its often colourful and variable patterns and its ability to survive in cooler waters than other fish; it can comfortably live at temperatures between . The species has also been used in genetic research.

<doc id="1240850" wikidata="Q1057183" url="?curid=1240850" title="Cessna 206">
<text>The Cessna 205, 206 and 207, known primarily as the Stationair (and marketed variously as the Super Skywagon, Skywagon and Super Skylane), are a family of single-engined, general aviation aircraft with fixed landing gear, used in commercial air service as well as for personal use. The family was originally developed from the popular retractable-gear Cessna 210 and produced by the Cessna Aircraft Company.

The line&#x27;s combination of a powerful engine, rugged construction and a large cabin has made these aircraft popular bush planes. Cessna describes the 206 as &quot;the sport-utility vehicle of the air.&quot; These airplanes are also used for aerial photography, skydiving and other utility purposes. They can also be equipped with floats, amphibious floats and skis. Alternatively, they can be fitted with luxury appointments for use as a personal air transport.

From 1962 to 2006 Cessna produced 8,509 aircraft in the 205, 206 and 207 variants. The aircraft remains in production.

==Development==

===Cessna 205===
The Cessna 205 was introduced late in 1962 as a 1963 model year. The six-seat aircraft was essentially a Cessna 210 with fixed landing gear and with changes to the crew and passenger door arrangement, being officially designated by Cessna as a &quot;Model 210-5&quot;. The 205 retained the early 210&#x27;s engine cowling bulge, originally where the 210 stowed its nosewheel on retraction. This distinctive cowling was made more streamlined on the later Cessna 206.

The 205 is powered by a Continental IO-470-S engine producing .
The 205 was produced in only two model years, 1963 and 1964, before being replaced in production by the Cessna 206. A total of 576 Cessna 205s were produced.

===Cessna 206===

The six-seat Model 206 was introduced as a 1964 model and was built until 1986, when Cessna halted production of its single-engined product line. It was then re-introduced in 1998 and remains in production.

There were many sub-variants, including the U206, P206 all certified to CAR3 standards and later 206H certified to FAR Part 23.
The total Model 206 production between 1964 and 2004 was 6,581 aircraft.

====Cessna U206====
The original 1964 model was the U206, powered by a Continental IO-520-A. The “U” designation indicated “utility” and this model was equipped with a pilot side door and large clamshell rear door serving the back two rows of seats, allowing easy loading of oversized cargo.

There was a TU206 turbocharged version powered by the Continental TSIO-520-C engine producing . After 1967, the turbo TU206 was powered by a TSIO-520-F of . The extra was obtained by turning the engine at a higher rpm, and was allowed for only five minutes. Due to the large propeller diameter, the additional engine speed meant that the propeller tips were pushed to transonic speeds, which required much more power.

From 1964 to 1969, the U206 was known as the “Super Skywagon”. From 1970, it was named the “Stationair”, a contraction of “Station Wagon of the Air”, which is a good description of the aircraft&#x27;s intended role. Sub-variants were designated U206 to U206G.

In 1977, the U206 had its engine upgraded to a Continental IO-520-F of (continuous rating, obtained at a lower speed than the previous IO-520-F) and the TU206 powerplant was changed to the TSIO-520-M producing .

Production of all versions of the U206 was halted in 1986 when Cessna stopped manufacturing all piston-engined aircraft. A total of 5,208 U206s had been produced.

====Cessna P206====
The P206 was added to the line in 1965. In this case the &quot;P&quot; stood for &quot;passenger&quot;, as the P206 had passenger doors similar to the Cessna 210 from which it was derived, on both sides.

The P206 was produced from 1965 to 1970 and was powered by a Continental IO-520-A of . There was a turbocharged model designated TP206 which was powered by a Continental TSIO-520-A also of .

Production of the P206 amounted to 647. The name “Super Skylane” made it sound like a version of the Cessna 182, which it was not. Sub-variants were designated P206 to P206E.

====Cessna 206H====

After a production hiatus of twelve years, Cessna started manufacturing a new version of the venerable 206 in 1998, with the introduction of the newly certified 206H. The “H” model is generally similar to the previous U206 configuration, with a pilot entry door and a rear double clamshell door for access to the middle and back seats. The &quot;H&quot; is marketed under the name &quot;Stationair&quot;.

The 206H is powered by a Lycoming IO-540-AC1A powerplant producing . The turbocharged T206H is powered by a Lycoming TIO-540-AJ1A engine of .

Even though the Cessna 206H is certified as a six-seat aircraft in its country of origin, the Canadian aviation regulator, Transport Canada has certified it to carry only five people in Canada. This is due to concerns about passenger egress through the rear clamshell door with the flaps extended. Cessna addressed one part of this problem early on, after a flight-test aircraft was damaged when the pilot extended the flaps while taxiing, and his passenger had the clamshell door open (for ventilation; it was a hot summer day). A switch was added to the flap actuation circuit which disabled the flaps when the doors were open. The other part of the problem is that if the flaps are already down, the passenger must perform the complicated procedure of opening the front part as far as possible (about ) then open the rear door and release the spring-loaded rear door handle so it retracts out of the way. This then gives enough clearance to open the rear part of the door fully for egress.

Both the 206H and the T206H remain in production in 2013. By the end of 2004, Cessna had produced 221 206Hs and 505 T206Hs, for a total production of 726 &quot;H&quot; models.
Cessna has indicated that they do not intend to produce a P206-configuration aircraft in the future, due to lack of market demand.

===Cessna 207===
The Model 207 was a seven- and later eight-seat development of the 206, achieved by stretching the design further by to allow space for more seats. The nose section was extended by adding a constant-section nose baggage compartment between the passenger compartment and the engine firewall; the aft section was extended by by inserting a constant-area section in the fuselage area just aft of the aft wing attach point. Thus the propeller&#x27;s ground clearance was unaffected by the change (the nosewheel had moved forward the same distance as the propeller), but the tail moved aft relative to the mainwheel position, which made landing (without striking the tailskid on the runway) a greater challenge. The move gave that airplane a larger turning radius, since the distance between mainwheels and nosewheel increased by but the nosewheel&#x27;s maximum allowed deflection was not increased.

The 207 was introduced as a 1969 model featuring a Continental IO-520-F engine of . A turbocharged version was equipped with a TSIO-520-G of the same output.

At the beginning of production the model was called a Cessna 207 &quot;Skywagon&quot;, but in 1977 the name was changed to &quot;Stationair 7&quot;. 1977 also saw a change of engine on the turbocharged version to a Continental TSIO-520-M producing – the same engine used in the TU206 of the same vintage.

The 207 added a seat in 1980 and was then known as the &quot;Stationair 8&quot;. Production of the 207 was completed in 1984, just two years before U206 production halted. A total of 626 Cessna 207s were manufactured.

The Cessna Model 207 has been popular with air taxi companies, particularly on short runs where its full seating capacity could be used. Very few of these aircraft have seen private use.

===Modifications===
In April 2007, Thielert announced that the European Aviation Safety Agency had granted a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for conversion of Cessna 206s to the Thielert V-8 diesel powerplant. The STC allows conversion of the following models: U206F and TU206F with the powerplant, and the U206G, TU206G, 206H and T206H with the version. This modification does not require any changes to the engine cowling. In May 2008, Thielert entered insolvency proceedings, so the future availability of this diesel conversion is uncertain.

Soloy Aviation Solutions offers a turboprop conversion for some 206/207 models with the Rolls-Royce/Allison M250 engine/gearbox package. However, extensive engine cowl modifications are required.

Atlantic Aero offers an FAA STC conversion to the Continental IO-550 powerplant. No cowl modifications are required.

Both Kenmore Air (Edo floats) and Wipaire (Wipline floats) offer seaplane conversions.

<doc id="1240857" wikidata="Q3521321" url="?curid=1240857" title="Damayanti">
<text>Damayanti () is a heroine in ancient Indian literature, primarily known for her role in the episode of &quot;Nalopakhyana&quot;, which is embedded within the &quot;Vana Parva&quot; (the third book) of the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (c. 400 BCE – 400 CE). She is celebrated for her beauty, intelligence, unwavering love, and steadfast devotion to her husband, Nala, the king of Nishadha kingdom.

Damayanti is the daughter of King Bhima and the princess of the Vidarbha Kingdom. She falls in love with Nala after hearing about his virtues from a divine swan. She chooses him in a swayamvara (self-choice ceremony), even rejecting gods who had disguised themselves as Nala. Their happiness is short-lived when Nala, influenced by the malicious deity Kali, loses his kingdom in a game of dice and is forced into exile. Overcome with despair and shame, he abandons Damayanti in the forest. Undeterred, she endures great hardships and eventually reaches her father’s court. Determined to find Nala, she devises a plan to draw him out by organizing a second swayamvara. The plan succeeds, and they are joyfully reunited. Nala then regains his kingdom, and the two are restored as the rightful king and queen of Nishadha.

Damayanti has been adapted in various Hindu texts by numerous authors across multiple Indian languages. Along with Nala, she is the central figure in &quot;Naishadhiya Charita&quot;, a 12th-century Sanskrit epic written by Sriharsha. This work is one of the five &quot;mahakavyas&quot; (great epic poems) in the canon of Sanskrit literature.

==Legend==
===Birth and early life===

King Bhima of Vidarbha remains childless for a long time. One day, the hermit Dama arrives at his palace and blesses him and his queen, resulting in the birth of a daughter, Damayanti, and three sons—Dama, Danta, and Damana. Damayanti grows up to be renowned for her exceptional beauty and virtues, attracting the admiration of many suitors. 

One day, a group of golden-hued swans arrives at Damayanti’s palace gardens. As Damayanti and her attendants play near the water, they notice these extraordinary birds. Intrigued, she follows them, and the swans do not flee. Instead, one of the swans speaks to her, describing the virtues, appearance, and qualities of Nala, the king of Nishada. It tells her that he is unmatched in strength, nobility, and righteousness, and would make a worthy husband. Damayanti listens intently, captivated by these descriptions, and develops a deep longing for Nala. After delivering this message, the swan returns to Nishadha and approaches Nala. It recounts its encounter with Damayanti, speaking of her beauty, intelligence, and grace. Nala, who has already heard of her, is now even more drawn to her. Thus, before meeting in person, they both develop a strong attachment through the words of this divine swan.

===Marriage===

In due time, King Bhima arranges a swayamvara for Damayanti, where she will choose her husband from among assembled kings and princes. Nala sets out for Vidarbha to attend the ceremony. Meanwhile, the gods Indra, Agni, Varuna, and Yama, having heard of Damayanti’s beauty from Narada, also decide to seek her hand in marriage. On their way to the swayamvara, the gods encounter Nala. Aware that Damayanti is already in love with him, they ask him to deliver a message, urging her to choose one of them instead. The gods grant Nala temporary invisibility, allowing him to enter Damayanti’s chambers unnoticed. He delivers their message, but Damayanti remains resolute in her decision to marry Nala. At the swayamvara, the four gods assume the appearance of Nala, making it impossible for Damayanti to distinguish the real one. She prays for divine guidance, and in response, the gods reveal their true forms, allowing her to identify and choose Nala. She garlands him, confirming her choice. The gods, pleased with her devotion and Nala’s virtues, bless him—Agni assures him of his presence whenever needed, Yama grants him righteousness, Varuna promises access to water at will, and Indra guarantees liberation after performing a sacrificial rite. Following the marriage, Nala and Damayanti reside happily in Nishadha.

=== Exile ===
The demon Kali, upon hearing of the swayamvara, is enraged that Damayanti has chosen a mortal over the gods. Along with Dvapara, who manipulate dice, he travels to Nishadha, intending to ruin Nala. Under Kali’s influence, Nala becomes obsessed with gambling and challenges his younger brother Pushkara to a game of dice which spans for several months. Deprived of his usual wisdom, Nala loses repeatedly. Despite Damayanti’s pleas, he continues playing until he loses his kingdom, wealth, and possessions. Realizing the danger, Damayanti sends their twins, Indrasena and Indrasenā, to her father’s palace in Vidarbha under the care of the charioteer Varshneya. Meanwhile, Nala, left with nothing, is banished from Nishadha, and Damayanti chooses to follow him into exile, donning a single garment each.

Even as they suffer from fatigue and hunger, Damayanti refuses to leave her husband&#x27;s side and suggests that they go to her father&#x27;s kingdom. Nala, however, rejects the idea, believing their current circumstances make it impossible. Eventually, the couple arrives at a public dwelling house. Still under the influence of Kali, Nala abandons his sleeping wife, reasoning that she would be happier without him. When Damayanti stirs, she laments his actions, calling him cruel and wondering how he will survive without her. She curses the being responsible for her husband&#x27;s misfortune, wishing them harm. As she moves aimlessly, a large snake captures her and begins to swallow her. She cries aloud for help, and a forester arrives, cutting the snake open and saving her. However, upon seeing Damayanti, the forester becomes overwhelmed with desire and tries to force himself upon her. In anger, she curses him, causing him to fall dead instantly.

===In Chedi and return to Vidharba===

Damayanti ventures deeper into the forest, where a caravan of traders passes by, fleeing from a herd of elephants that has attacked them. She approaches them and recounts part of her story, omitting details of her royal identity. The traders take pity on her and bring her to the kingdom of Chedi. Upon reaching Chedi, Damayanti wanders the streets, attracting the attention of onlookers. Mistaking her for a madwoman, street boys begin to follow and mock her. The queen-mother, observing this from the palace, feels compassion for the distressed woman and sends her maid to bring Damayanti inside. When questioned, Damayanti reveals her hardships but does not disclose her true identity. The queen-mother offers her shelter and appoints her as an attendant to her daughter, Sunanda. However, Damayanti sets strict conditions—she refuses to eat leftovers, will not allow others to wash her feet, will not interact with unrelated men, and demands that anyone who makes improper advances toward her be punished. The queen-mother agrees, and Damayanti begins her life in the palace.

In Vidarbha, King Bhima remains unaware of his daughter’s fate and continues searching for both Damayanti and Nala. He sends Brahmins across various kingdoms with the promise of generous rewards for any information. One of these Brahmins, Sudeva, reaches Chedi and immediately recognizes Damayanti, despite her disheveled appearance. When he approaches her in private, she confirms her identity. Sunanda, witnessing the encounter, informs her mother. The queen-mother, deeply moved, reveals that she and Damayanti’s mother are sisters, both being daughters of King Sudama of Dasarna, making them family. Subahu, the king of Chedi, upon learning the truth, arranges for Damayanti’s return to Vidarbha in a palanquin. She reaches her father’s palace safely and reunites with her grieving family.

Meanwhile, Nala, in despair, encounters the serpent Karkotaka trapped in a forest fire. After rescuing him, the serpent bites Nala, deforming his appearance to shield him from enemies and weaken Kali’s influence. He advises Nala to serve King Rituparna of Ayodhya as a charioteer and gives him divine garments to restore his true form later. Disguised as Bahuka, Nala impresses Rituparna with his unmatched charioteering and cooking skills, securing a position in the palace. Though excelling in his duties, he remains sorrowful, often lamenting his lost wife.
=== Reunion ===
After returning to Vidarbha, Damayanti remains inconsolable and refuses remarriage. Determined to find Nala, King Bhima sends Brahmins across kingdoms. One of them, Parnada, reaches Ayodhya and meets Bahuka, King Rituparna’s charioteer. Noting Bahuka’s exceptional charioteering skills and emotional reaction to Damayanti’s name, Parnada reports back to her. Suspecting Bahuka to be Nala in disguise, Damayanti devises a test.

She sends Sudeva to Ayodhya with an announcement of a false second swayamvara, knowing that only Nala possesses the ability to drive a chariot fast enough to reach Vidarbha within a single day. Rituparna, eager to attend, orders Bahuka to drive him. Upon arrival, she secretly observes Bahuka and conducts several tests:
*She sends her maid, Kesini, to question him, and he reacts emotionally to Damayanti’s suffering.
*She notes his unique abilities, such as doors adjusting for him, water pots filling on their own, and fire not burning him.
*Recognizing his distinct cooking style, she confirms he matches Nala’s culinary skills.
*She sends Indrasena and Indrasenā to him, and he embraces them tearfully.
Convinced that he is Nala, she arranges a direct meeting. Confronting him, she questions his abandonment. Nala, overcome with emotion, explains his suffering under Kali’s curse. At that moment, the wind god Vayu proclaims Damayanti’s unwavering fidelity.

Nala dons the divine garments given by the serpent Karkotaka and regains his true form. With their identities confirmed, Damayanti and Nala reunite. King Bhima and the citizens of Vidarbha rejoice. Shortly after, Nala returns to Nishadha, challenges Pushkara to another game of dice, and this time wins. He reclaims his kingdom but chooses to forgive his brother. Damayanti and their children join him, and Nala rules wisely, restoring prosperity to his people.

<text>Theobald Böhm (or Boehm) (9 April 1794 – 25 November 1881) was a German inventor and musician, who greatly improved the modern Western concert flute and its fingering system (now known as the &quot;Boehm system&quot;). He was a Bavarian court musician, a virtuoso flautist and a renowned composer.

The fingering system he devised has also been adapted to other instruments, such as the oboe and the clarinet.

== Life and works ==

Born in Munich in the Electorate of Bavaria in the family of goldsmith Carl Friedrich Böhm and Anna Franziska, née Sulzbacher, daughter of a court haberdasher. Boehm learned his father&#x27;s trade of goldsmithing. After making his own flute, he quickly became proficient enough to play in an orchestra at the age of seventeen, and at twenty-one he was first flautist in the Royal Bavarian Orchestra. Meanwhile, he experimented with constructing flutes out of many different materials—tropical hardwoods (usually Grenadilla wood), silver, gold, nickel and copper—and with changing the positions of the flute&#x27;s tone holes.

After studying acoustics at the University of Munich, he began experimenting on improving the flute in 1832, first patenting his new fingering system in 1847. He published &quot;Über den Flötenbau&quot; (&quot;On the construction of flutes&quot;), also in 1847. His new flute was first displayed in 1851 at the London Exhibition. In 1871 Boehm published &quot;Die Flöte und das Flötenspiel&quot; (&quot;The Flute and Flute-Playing&quot;), a treatise on the acoustical, technical and artistic characteristics of the Boehm system flute.

Boehm&#x27;s experience as a goldsmith was a key factor in his ability to redesign the flute. For example, in &quot;The Flute and Flute-Playing&quot; he recounts having made a flute with moveable tone holes, in order to determine the proper location of each hole for correct intonation—a remarkable piece of metal-working.

Traditional flutes were limited in size because the player had to be able to reach all the tone holes in the span of two hands. By substituting mechanically covered tone holes, Boehm eliminated this limitation, and was able to make larger, deeper flutes, such as the alto flute. Boehm was very fond of the alto flute, and recounts a time he was playing it when someone mistook it for a French horn.

== Legacy ==

Some of the flutes he made are still being played. The fingering system he devised has also been adapted to other instruments, such as the oboe and the clarinet.

He inspired Hyacinthe Klosé, the inventor of the modern clarinet fingering system. Klosé invented a system for the clarinet that today is the standard nearly worldwide (except Austria, Germany and others). Boehm was his inspiration, and so Klosé named the new system the Boehm system just like the modern western flute. The Boehm system clarinet and flute are not exactly the same. If one plays the clarinet with the register key on, the fingerings are the same as the flute when the flute is in the lower and middle register. The main differences between the fingering systems of Boehm system clarinets and flutes are overblowing and key. The clarinet&#x27;s second register is a twelfth above its lowest register, unlike the flute&#x27;s which is an octave higher. The B clarinet is a transposing instrument, so a C on a clarinet is played as a B on the flute.

<text>Nala () is a legendary king of ancient Nishadha kingdom and the central protagonist of the &quot;Nalopakhyana&quot;, a sub-narrative within the Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, found in its third book, &quot;Vana Parva&quot; (Book of the Forest). He is renowned for his valor, wisdom, and exceptional skill in charioteering. His story revolves around his love for Damayanti, the princess of Vidarbha, and his struggle to reclaim his lost fortune. 

According to &quot;Nalopakhyana&quot;, despite his virtues, Nala falls victim to a curse from the malicious deity Kali, who influences him to lose his kingdom in a game of dice against his brother Pushkara. Forced into exile, he abandons Damayanti in the forest, believing she would suffer less without him. Wandering in disguise under the name Bahuka after being transformed by a serpent’s bite, Nala takes service as a charioteer in the court of King Rituparna of Ayodhya, where he acquires new skills in gambling and horsemanship. Meanwhile, Damayanti devises a plan to find him. Their eventual reunion leads to Nala reclaiming his true identity, allowing him to challenge Pushkara in a new game and restore his kingdom. 

The story of Nala has had a profound influence on Indian literature, folklore, and performing arts. It has been retold in various Sanskrit and regional texts, including adaptations in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Bengali literature. The 12th-century poet Sriharsha composed &quot;Naishadhiya Charita&quot;, an epic based on Nala’s tale, which is considered one of the five great Sanskrit mahakavyas. Nala is also regarded as a great cook and the cookbook &quot;Pakadarpanam&quot; () is attributed to him.

==Biography==
Nala&#x27;s biography is attested in the &quot;Nalopakhyana&quot; section of &quot;Vana Parva&quot;, the third book of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

Nala is born to Virasena, the king of Nishada Kingdom, and grows up into a handsome youth, renowned for his righteousness, exceptional charioteering skills, and devotion to dharma. While Nala is in the palace garden, a group of golden-winged swans arrives at the lake. Amused, he captures one of them, which then addresses him with a proposal: if released, it will fly to Vidarbha and speak of his virtues to Damayanti, the princess of Vidarbha. Accepting this offer, Nala sets the swan free. The swan fulfills its promise, flying to Vidarbha and praising Nala before Damayanti, fostering her admiration for him. In return, the swans carry her admiration back to Nala. Deeply drawn to each other, Nala prepares to attend Damayanti’s svayamvara, the ceremony where she will choose her husband. Meanwhile, the gods Indra, Agni, Varuna, and Yama, having heard of Damayanti’s beauty, also desire to marry her. On their way to the svayamvara, they encounter Nala and request that he deliver their proposal to Damayanti. Granted invisibility, Nala enters her chamber and conveys their message. However, Damayanti remains steadfast in her love for Nala and chooses him over the gods. To test her devotion, the gods assume Nala’s form during the svayamvara, making it difficult for her to distinguish him. Through divine intuition, she identifies the real Nala and places the nuptial garland around his neck. Pleased with their love, the gods bestow blessings upon Nala: Agni promises to aid him whenever called, Yama grants him unwavering righteousness, Varuna ensures he will never lack water, and Indra guarantees him moksha (liberation) upon completing a sacrifice.

Kali, the deity of discord, harbors resentment toward Nala for winning Damayanti’s hand and vows to ruin him. Along with Dvapara, he waits for an opportunity to influence Nala’s fate. After twelve years, Kali finds an opening when Nala fails to wash his feet before performing his evening prayers. Exploiting this lapse in ritual purity, Kali takes possession of Nala’s mind, corrupting his judgment. Under Kali’s influence, Nala becomes addicted to gambling and challenges his younger brother, Pushkara, to a game of dice. Manipulated by Kali and Dvapara, Nala suffers continuous losses, eventually forfeiting his kingdom, wealth, and status. As his misfortunes worsen, Damayanti sends their children, Indrasena and Indrasenā, to her father’s kingdom for safety. Ultimately, Nala is left with nothing but a single garment, and Pushkara decrees that anyone who assists him will be executed. Stripped of his power and possessions, Nala wanders into the forest. When he attempts to catch golden birds for food, they fly away with his last piece of clothing, revealing themselves to be the dice that had caused his ruin. Fearing for Damayanti’s safety, Nala urges her to seek refuge with a caravan of traders. She refuses, vowing to stay by his side. That night, as she sleeps, Nala, believing she will be safer without him, cuts a piece of her garment and abandons her.

During his exile, Nala comes across a raging fire and hears a voice calling for help. He discovers the serpent Karkotaka, who is trapped in the flames due to a curse. Nala rescues him, and in return, Karkotaka bites him, altering his appearance and making him unrecognizable. The serpent explains that this transformation is a protective measure and that the venom will weaken Kali’s hold over him. He also provides Nala with two divine garments, which will restore his true form when worn. Following Karkotaka’s guidance, Nala assumes the identity of Bahuka, an expert charioteer, and travels to Ayodhya. There, he enters the service of King Rituparna, offering his exceptional charioteering skills in exchange for knowledge of gambling. Despite his altered form, Nala’s skills and demeanor intrigue those around him. Each evening, he recites verses lamenting a man who has lost everything, arousing the curiosity of his fellow servants, particularly Jivala and Varsneya.

Meanwhile, Damayanti has been found by her father and taken back to Vidarbha. She remains committed to searching for Nala, despite widespread assumptions of his demise. When the messenger Parnada reports about Bahuka, the skilled charioteer in Ayodhya who has shown interest in her, she devises a plan. She instructs a Brahmin to inform Rituparna that she will hold a second svayamvara the following day, knowing that only Nala can drive a chariot fast enough to reach Vidarbha within that time. As expected, Rituparna, eager to win Damayanti’s hand, orders Bahuka to drive him to Vidarbha with great speed. During the journey, Rituparna demonstrates his ability to count the leaves on a tree at a glance, showcasing his mastery of Akshahridaya (the art of gambling). In exchange, Nala reveals his expertise in horse-riding (Ashvahridaya), and they exchange their knowledge. At the moment he gains this new knowledge, Nala expels Kali’s influence from his body.

Upon their arrival in Vidarbha, Rituparna is surprised to find no actual preparations for a swayamvara and realizes he has been misled. Meanwhile, Damayanti closely observes Bahuka and conducts a series of tests to confirm his identity. She first sends her maid, Keshini, to question him. Although Nala does not reveal his identity, his emotions betray him when he hears of Damayanti’s suffering. Damayanti instructs Kesini to closely observe Bahuka’s actions. She notes several supernatural qualities:
*He does not need to lower his head when passing through doorways, as the upper sill lifts on its own.
*He moves through crowds without obstruction, as people instinctively make way for him.
*Empty water pots fill instantly when he gazes upon them.
*A blade of grass catches fire when he stretches it toward the sun.
*Fire does not burn him, even when he touches it.
*When he crushes a flower, it blooms again, appearing more vibrant and fragrant.
Remembering that Nala was an exceptional cook, Damayanti requests food prepared by Bahuka. Upon tasting it, she recognizes the distinct flavor of Nala’s cooking, confirming her suspicions. As a final test, Damayanti sends their children, Indrasena and Indrasenā, to Bahuka. Overcome with emotion, Bahuka embraces them and weeps. When questioned, he claims he is moved because they resemble two children he once knew. Finally, Damayanti confronts him, accusing him of abandoning her in the forest. Overwhelmed with emotion, Nala recounts his hardships and explains his transformation. He then dons the divine garments provided by Karkotaka, restoring his true form. At that moment, Vayu, the wind god, affirms Damayanti’s faithfulness, and the couple is reunited.

Determined to reclaim his throne, Nala gathers an army and returns to Nishadha. He challenges Pushkara to another game of dice, now equipped with his newfound mastery over gambling. This time, he wins decisively, regaining his kingdom and all that he had lost. However, in an act of magnanimity, he forgives Pushkara and restores his status. Nala rules wisely, restoring prosperity to his people. 

The story has also been adapted into the 12th century text Nishadha Charita, one of the five &quot;mahakavyas&quot; (great epic poems) in the canon of Sanskrit literature, where few additional plot details are invented.

<text>Sergey Alexeyevich Chaplygin (; 5 April 1869 – 8 October 1942) was a Russian and Soviet physicist, mathematician, and mechanical engineer. He is known for mathematical formulas such as Chaplygin&#x27;s equation and for a hypothetical substance in cosmology called Chaplygin gas, named after him.

He graduated in 1890 from Moscow University, and later became a professor. He taught mechanical engineering at Moscow Higher Courses for Women in 1901, and of applied mathematics at Moscow School of Technology, 1903. He was appointed Director of the courses in 1905. Leonid I. Sedov was one of his students.

Chaplygin&#x27;s theories were greatly inspired by N. Ye. Zhukovsky, who founded the Central Institute of Aerodynamics. His early research focused on hydromechanics. His &quot;Collected Works&quot;, consisting of 4 volumes, were published in 1948.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Chaplygin was born to Aleksei Timofeevich Chaplygin, a shop assistant, and Anna Petrovna in Ranenburg (present day Chaplygin), Russia. After his father died when he was 2 years old, his mother remarried a tradesman and they moved to Voronezh. There, he attended the Voronezh Gymnasium, which he graduated in 1886.

Soon after, he attended the Moscow University, specializing in Physics and Mathematics, which he graduated from in 1890. There he met and was strongly influenced by Nikolai Egorovich Zhukovsky. In 1893, he published his first work, &quot;On certain cases of the motion of a solid body in a fluid&quot;, for which he received the N. D. Brashman Award.

After graduating from the university, he went on to become a professor there. In 1897, he published &quot;On the motion of a heavy body of revolution in a horizontal plane,&quot; which was the first to present the general equation of motion of a nonholonomic system. This equation is a generalisation of Lagrange&#x27;s equation. In 1899, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.

=== Death ===

Chaplygin died of a brain haemorrhage in October 1942.

==Honours and awards==
* Hero of Socialist Labour (February 1, 1941)
* Two Orders of Lenin (February 1, 1941 and December 22, 1933)
* Order of the Red Banner of Labour, twice (July 10, 1927 and ?)
* Zhukovsky Prize (1925)
* N. D. Brashman Prize (1897)

Chaplygin was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences (the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1925-1991) in 1924.

The lunar crater Chaplygin and town Chaplygin are named in his honour.

<doc id="1240867" wikidata="Q7257901" url="?curid=1240867" title="Public housing in the Australian Capital Territory">
<text>Government-owned housing in Canberra and the Australian Capital Territory has a history stemming from the decision to build the National Capital in the bush. In the early years Canberra&#x27;s housing was entirely government-built and even after private development took over there has been a number of government houses included in almost every new suburb. Typical Canberra public housing is built on a limited number of plans repeated through an area of a suburb, with two or three bedrooms and constructed in unfinished brick veneer. They typically range in size from around 80 m2 to 130 m2. The term &quot;Govie&quot; (pronounced &quot;guvvie&quot;) is a colloquialism used to describe the typical Canberran government built house.

==History==

===Early days===
The earliest post-ACT housing in Canberra was the work camps for the labourers brought in to construct the new capital. By 1913 the workforce had reached 754 people. The majority lived in camps - single and married quarters - placed at the major work sites of now Acton (administration &amp; first nursery area), Kingston (power house) Yarralumla (brickyards), and Cotter River (Water-Dam). Single men lived in tents and married men constructed their own humpies.

A few permanent cottages were constructed at Acton in the teen years of the twentieth century and by 1912 the timber accommodation known as &quot;The Bachelors Quarters&#x27; was occupied.

:The outbreak of World War I led to the slowing of work and a reduction of the workforce.

In 1921/22 the FCAC (Federal Capital Advisory Commission) had a number of brick cottages erected for tradesmen at Brickyards (7), opposite the Power House (modern Barton - 20 cottages ) and at Civic (20). In 1923 a further 16 were constructed at Blandfordia (Forrest).

In 1921/22 the remaining buildings of the Molonglo Internment Camp (now Fyshwick) were converted into Canberra&#x27;s first temporary settlement for workmen. It consisted of 120 houses and accommodation for 150 tradesmen. This settlement was followed in 1924 by 52 timber cottages (very small - 2 bedroom) at Westlake (now Stirling Park Yarralumla) and 15 at Acton. The following year in 1925 work commenced on another 20 at Causeway and these were followed in turn by another 80.

These few houses were quite insufficient for the number of construction workers living in the territory and in 1925 the FCC (Federal Capital Commission) made available 80 sites at Riverbourne (south side of the Molonglo River 3 miles from the Queanbeyan Post Office). At Riverbourne and Russell Hill (modern suburb of Campbell) where another 120 sites were made available men again were expected to construct their own cottages. Riverbourne closed in early 1927 and Russell Hill - opened in 1926 - lasted until the mid-1950s.

The temporary suburbs of Molonglo, Westlake, Acton workmen&#x27;s cottages remained until in the case of Molonglo into the 1950s and Westlake/Acton in to the mid-1960s. Causeway remained until the mid-1970s when the timber temporary cottages were replaced with brick.

One contractor, John Howie, whose men built the Hotel Canberra, erected 25 timber cottages for his married men and 18 or more timber huts for his single men in the area of modern Stirling Park on the hill opposite Lotus Bay.

Single men continued to live under canvas until 1926 when the tents in the majority of settled camps were replaced with small cubicles constructed from baltic pine.

In 1925 three permanent&#x27; camps were erected for single men - south side at Causeway, centre of Canberra on Capitol Hill - and on the north side near modern Civic. This last mentioned camp was known as White City Camp and it was removed in the early 1930s when the land was required for building Canberra High School (now the Art School).

Capitol Hill (later named Capital Hill) Camp continued with additional buildings added after World War 2 into the 1960s.

Construction for the Public Servants being transferred to Canberra began 1925–26. The first couple of departments were transferred to Canberra in 1926 and were followed in early 1927 by the majority of departments transferred to Canberra.

People living in the temporary houses were unable to buy their cottages and did not receive any allowances for living in an area that was more expensive than the capital cities. Those transferring to the city, however, received allowances that ranged from around 19 pounds pa to 60-70 odd .

The rental cost for each cottage was based on the money paid for the construction of each. A cap was placed on building costs in each suburb which resulted in the lower paid officials transferring to Canberra being houses in Ainslie, North Ainslie and South Ainslie (now Braddon, Ainslie &amp; Reid). The better paid officials moved into Forrest.

People were encouraged to buy their houses for the cost of construction only and any rent paid was included in the payment.

Single people transferring to the Territory were housed in Gorman House (females only in the early years), Beauchamp House, Brassey House (now Hotel Brassey), Hotel Acton, Hotel Ainslie (for short time only) and Hotel Kurrajong.

The Hotel Canberra was the first hostel to be built - in 1925 - to house politicians and even if a workman could afford the tariff he would not be allowed to stay there. The Kurrajong followed the next year and the others mentioned earlier with the exception of Gorman House (built 1925) were constructed in 1927.

The Federal Capital Commission was formed in 1925 to prepare the city for the transfer of public servants and their families. The commission had been preceded by the Federal Capital Advisory Committee which had overseen the commencement of construction of Canberra following the termination of the Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s contract.

In May 1925 the FCC decided to create a Social Service Association. This plan brought all the Progress Associations under the control of the FCC. A meeting was held and a document made that gives us the information about the numbers in each of the settlements and camps. Molonglo had a population of 750 and Westlake (Stirling Park) had 700 living in Howie&#x27;s Settlement, Westlake Cottages and three government single camps.
The majority of houses constructed for those transferring to Canberra were built by private contractors with some day labour. HLB Lasseter was one who worked as a carpenter on the Ainslie cottages.

In 1927 the government approved construction of 545 government houses and for the first time approved the construction of 110 privately built houses. Unfortunately, the following year saw the approval of only 24 private dwellings, due mainly to the looming Great Depression. Even government construction was slowing down with only two houses under construction by the middle of 1928.

By 1941 there were only 400 privately owned houses in Canberra compared to 1633 government houses and a further 309 government-owned workers&#x27; cottages and tenements. World War II again brought a halt to housing construction in Canberra and by the end of the war Canberra&#x27;s housing shortage was estimated at least 500 houses with 600 people on the government housing waiting list.

Those who were able to find the money to build within the required two-year period had the added problem of rationing of bricks etc.

In the post-World War 2 period many flats were built to help house those in desperate need of accommodation.

===Post World War II===
The years following the end of the war led to even greater demands for public housing in Canberra. Facing building supply shortages and ever-increasing demand for accommodation, alternate methods of housing construction were investigated. The ACT Advisory Council recommended that &quot;temporary housing in the form of rebuilt Army huts be provided for at least 100 families, subject to it being assumed as a government responsibility that these huts be replaced by housing of adequate standard at a later stage.&quot;. Hostels were erected near modern-day Commonwealth Park, Reid, Kingston and Barton. The hostels were built using ex-military buildings moved from Narellan near Sydney and Mulwala in the Riverina.

In 1947 disused sleeping huts from Tocumwal air base were transported to Canberra and refitted as family homes. The huts had been built originally to resemble houses rather than barracks to avoid aerial detection and bombing. They are of weatherboard and fibro construction and have wide verandahs. 100 of the &quot;Tocumwals&quot; were erected in O&#x27;Connor around a central park. Some Tocumwals were also located in Ainslie. Many are still standing to this day. Unusually, the houses were erected without concrete foundations in order to save time and money; the brick footings sat on a double row of bricks laid directly onto the ground in a shallow trench.

In 1946 the government began experimenting with concrete construction, with a test concrete wall being added to a house in Turner. An initial contract of 100 monocrete prefabricated houses was tendered in 1946 for construction in Turner and O&#x27;Connor. A further group of 45 houses was scheduled for Yarralumla in 1948. Monocrete houses were also constructed in many other Canberra suburbs.

Other forms of prefabricated housing were tested during this time. The Beaufort aircraft factory built a prefabricated steel house in Ainslie. In 1948, a timber prefabricated house was imported from Finland and erected in Canberra. Riley-Newsum prefabricated houses were constructed at Duntroon, Ainslie, O’Connor and Deakin in the early 1950s.

Families arriving in Canberra soon after the war were often accommodated in hostels such as Reid House or the Acton Hotel, sometimes initially they were offered a room in the house of a colleague. Some families were split between hostels, and the government encouraged families to send their children away to boarding school.

The government also reversed its earlier policy and started building flats in Canberra. Between 1948 and 1952 four blocks of flats were built at Griffith, Braddon and Ainslie, containing a total of 184 one- and two-bedroom flats.

Even with these increased construction measures, waiting lists for public housing continued to increase. By 1955 the list contained more than 3000 families and individuals.

===The NCDC===
In March 1958 the National Capital Development Commission took responsibility for the planning and construction of Canberra. It inherited a public housing system with a waiting list of 3,000 people and imminent plans to move 3,000 more public servants from Melbourne and Sydney.

===Self Government===
In 1989 control of public housing in Canberra switched to the newly formed ACT government. By then the stock of government houses in Canberra was ageing. The standard of accommodation was lower than in other states and many houses were of non-conventional, high maintenance construction.

==Government housing today==
Government housing in the ACT is now controlled by &quot;Housing and Community Services ACT&quot; a division of the ACT &quot;Department of Disability, Housing and Community Services&quot;. The public housing system in Canberra now contains over 11,000 properties. Criteria for allocation of housing was made more stringent in the 2006-07 Australian Capital Territory budget. Single people earning more than 60% of the average wage and couples earning more than 75% of the average wage will not be eligible.

==Modernisation==
Government housing has been progressively sold off over the years into private ownership. Extensions, decks, bagging (cement render) and painting have re-made the Canberra &quot;Govie&quot; into a different yet still distinctive style of house. These privately owned properties are colloquially referred to as &quot;Ex-Govies&quot;.

In the 2006 budget, the Government announced it would sell a further 500 dwellings and use the proceeds to reinvest in other public housing.

==Forestry settlements==
During the early years of the ACT the government built small forestry settlements at Uriarra, Pierces Creek and Stromlo. These settlements were devastated in the 2003 Canberra bushfires and their fate remains under consideration.

<doc id="1240870" wikidata="Q4949873" url="?curid=1240870" title="Bound by the Beauty">
<text>Bound By the Beauty is a 1989 album by Jane Siberry. It received better reviews than her previous album, &quot;The Walking&quot;, and the title track received more extensive radio airplay than Siberry had seen since &quot;One More Colour&quot; in 1985.

The track &quot;Half Angel Half Eagle&quot; was controversial. Siberry used the images of an angel and an eagle soaring over a city to depict a view of both the beauty and the ugliness of city life; the ugliness was apparent in the lyric &quot;fucking honky nigger Jew/WASP Jap fag/fucking homeless preacher dyke/cabbie fucking union scab&quot;. Siberry was commenting on the prevalence of this type of offensive language on the streets of a big city.

The track &quot;The Valley&quot; was played during the funeral service for John Balance.

&quot;Something About Trains&quot; also appeared (as &quot;This Old Earth&quot;) on &quot;The Top of His Head&quot;, the soundtrack to Peter Mettler&#x27;s film &quot;The Top of His Head&quot;; the song was a Genie Award nominee for Best Original Song at the 11th Genie Awards in 1990.

Mettler also took the album&#x27;s cover photograph.

<text>The New Jersey Shore Line Railroad was part of the New York Central Railroad and ran along the Hudson River in New Jersey, from the West Shore Railroad (NYCRR) yards at Guttenberg north to the Erie Terminals Railroad at the Hudson/Bergen County line.

The company was organized on February 25, 1886, and chartered March 2, 1886 to build a railroad from a point in Union Township to a point in Harrington, about away. The entire capital stock was owned by the New Jersey Junction Railroad Company, which was under lease by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. In 1910, of track were built from the West Shore Railroad Weehawken yards midway through Guttenberg north to the line with Bergen County. It opened for traffic on March 14, 1911, with the first cars passing over it on May 16, 1911. The rest of the route was never built.

The company was absorbed into the New Jersey Junction Railroad, which had owned its stock, on October 24, 1914. Eventually the line passed under control of CSX and Norfolk Southern; it was part of their River Line before it was abandoned.

<doc id="1240883" wikidata="Q8066766" url="?curid=1240883" title="Zari">
<text>Zari (or &quot;jari&quot;) is an even thread traditionally made of fine gold or silver used in traditional Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani garments, especially as brocade in saris etc. This thread is woven into fabrics, primarily silk, to make intricate patterns and elaborate designs of embroidery called &quot;zardozi&quot;. &quot;Zari&quot; was popularised during the Moghul era; the port of Surat was linked to the Meccan pilgrimage route which served as a major factor for re-introducing this ancient craft in India. 

&quot;Zari&quot; is the main decorative material in most silk saris and ghararas. It is also used in other garments made of silk, like lehengas (skirts), cholis (blouses), kurtas, and dhotis.

==Manufacture==

The etymological root of the word is Persian.

Zari is basically a brocade of tinsel thread meant for weaving and embroidery. It is manufactured by winding or wrapping (covering) a flattened metallic strip made from pure gold, silver or slit metallised polyester film, on a core yarn, usually of pure silk, viscose, cotton, nylon, polyester, P.P., mono/multi filament, wire, etc. Nowadays, it can broadly be divided into three types. Real zari, imitation zari, and metallic zari.

Real Zari is made from fine silver or gold thread is drawn from silver or gold alloys, which is flattened by passing it under equal pressure rotating rollers. The flattened silver threads are wound on the base yarn that is usually made of silk. These spools with silk and silver threads are further flattened for electroplating. The threads are then plated with gold by the process of electroplating. The lustre of the gilded threads is further increased by passing them through a brightener. These threads are then wound on a reel.

In ancient times, when precious metals were cheaply and easily available, only real zari threads were produced. Due to industrial revolution and invention of electroplating process, imitation techniques came into existence to cut the cost of precious metals. As copper is the most malleable and ductile metal after gold and silver, silver electroplated copper wire replaced pure silver. Various modern colours and chemicals are used to create/impart a golden hue instead of pure gold. The precious metals and copper too became dearer due to huge demand in various modern industries. Thus, a cheap and durable alternative was invented with non-tarnishing properties. Metallic zari came into vogue replacing traditional metals like gold, silver &amp; copper. This non-genuine modern zari is light in weight &amp; more durable than earlier editions. Also, it has the sought after properties of resistance to tarnishing and knotting.

Imitation zari is made when copper wires are drawn from copper alloys. It then undergoes a similar process, except in this case, they are electroplated with silver and then wound around the base yarn, and reeled. This type of zari is less expensive than pure zari, as silver electroplated copper is more economical.

Metallic sari is a modernized version of ari and it replaces traditional metals like gold, silver and copper. It is resistant, durable and light in weight. It is non-tarnishing and maintains its lustre for a considerable period of time.

Zari is used in various forms such as Zardozi, Kataoki Bel, Mukaish, Tilla or Marori Work, Gota Work, and Kinari Work.

Surat in the state of Gujarat on the west coast of India is the world&#x27;s largest producer of all types of zari namely threads, cantile, laces, ribbons, borders, trims, fringes, edges, cordonettes, cords, etc. The art of zari making has been inherited from father to son for many centuries. It is recognised as one of the ancient handicrafts by the government of India. Women from different communities &amp; artisans produce zari for weaving, embroidery, crocheting, braiding, etc. Additionally, 
there are approximately 100,000 child laborers producing Zari in India, sometimes (but not always) under conditions of debt bondage or otherwise unpaid work.

==Kalabattun==
Kalabattun is an ancient term for metallic threads, such as gold-wrapped threads, that are used in a variety of brocade and embroidery arts.
==Quality of pure Zari==
245 grams of Zari is called one mark. It contains 191 grams of silver (78 percent), 51.55 grams of silk (21 percent), and 2.45 grams of gold (1 percent).

<text>Zina Bianca Bethune (February 17, 1945 – February 12, 2012) was an American actress, dancer, and choreographer. She was the daughter of actress Ivy Bethune.

==Early years==
Bethune was born on Staten Island, the daughter of Ivy ( Vigder), a Russian-born (Sevastopol, present-day Ukraine) actress who started in the &quot;Superman&quot; radio series, and later became known for playing &quot;Miss Tuttle&quot; on &quot;Father Murphy&quot; and &quot;Abigail&quot; on &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

== Career ==

===Theater and dance===
Bethune began her formal ballet training aged six at George Balanchine&#x27;s School of American Ballet.

By age 14 she was dancing with the New York City Ballet as Clara in the 1955 Balanchine production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. Bethune&#x27;s first professional acting role was at age six, with a small part in the off-Broadway play &quot;Monday&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, produced by Stella Holt at the Greenwich Mews Theater.

===Television===
As a child performer, Bethune appeared in the original cast of &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot; as well as several American daytime television dramas, including a stint as the first &quot;Robin Lang&quot; on &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; from May 1956 to April 1958. Bethune played President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s daughter in &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot; in 1960.

Newspaper columnist Dick Kleiner described Bethune&#x27;s performance in a 1958 television production as a &quot;shatteringly beautiful portrayal of Tennessee Williams&#x27; young heroine in &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot;.&quot;

In October 1958, she portrayed Amy March in the CBS musical adaptation of &quot;Little Women&quot;. She portrayed nurse Gail Lucas on &quot;The Nurses&quot; (1962–65), and appeared in other series, including &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; (with Martin Huston in the series finale), &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;, &quot;Pantomime Quiz&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Young Dr. Malone&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;The Invaders&quot;, and &quot;Emergency!&quot;

===Film===
Bethune starred as &quot;The Girl&quot; alongside Harvey Keitel in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Knocking at My Door&quot;.

===Other work===
Throughout her life, Bethune worked with disabled students. She herself was diagnosed with scoliosis at age 11, and hip dysplasia.

Bethune founded Bethune Theatredanse (now called &quot;Theatre Bethune&quot;) in 1981, a nonprofit dance and drama company that has toured internationally and performed at the White House. 

She founded Dance Outreach, now known as Infinite Dreams, in 1980, which, as of 2012, enrolls about 8,000 disabled children in dance-related activities throughout Southern California.

==Death==
On February 12, 2012, five days before her 67th birthday, Bethune was killed in an apparent hit and run crash while she was trying to help an injured opossum in Griffith Park, Los Angeles.

<doc id="1240892" wikidata="Q7621177" url="?curid=1240892" title="Strake Jesuit College Preparatory">
<text>Strake Jesuit College Preparatory (properly referred to as Strake Jesuit or Jesuit but often informally called Strake) is a Jesuit, college-preparatory school for boys, grades 9–12, in the Chinatown area and in the Greater Sharpstown district of Houston, Texas, United States. It is near Alief.

With over 1,200 students, it is the largest Catholic high school in Houston. It has a full-time curator for its art collection; the City of Houston has classified the campus as an art museum. The school is located within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston. It is one of only two private schools in Texas that are members of the University Interscholastic League (the other being Dallas Jesuit), which allows it to compete athletically against the largest public schools.

==History==
The school was founded by Father Michael Kenelley, S.J., on June 21, 1960, in what was then the undeveloped, west side of Houston. It is named in honor of oil tycoon George William Strake Sr.

The school&#x27;s patron saint is Stanislaus Kostka, a Polish Jesuit who serves as a patron of students; additionally, as a Jesuit institution, Ignatius of Loyola is invoked as an unofficial patron saint.

In 1971, the school asked to declare Chapter 10 bankruptcy as it lost money in the Sharpstown scandal. The school surrendered seven acres of its original property to pay its debts and emerge from bankruptcy protection. The seven-acre tract was repurchased by the school in 2012 for $3.3 million. 

From 1990 to 1993, the number of applications submitted to Strake Jesuit doubled. Fr. Brian Zinnamon, the school president, said during the year that there were twice as many applicants as available spots. At the time, tuition was $4,700 per year, described by the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; as steep. Father Zinnamon said, &quot;Certainly what is going on in the public schools is a factor. Parents are choosing a safe environment where they know their children are getting Christian values.&quot; 

In 2005, before Hurricane Katrina, the school had 899 students. An additional 410 were temporarily enrolled at Strake after the hurricane for a period of time from Jesuit High School in New Orleans. 

==Athletics==
The &quot;Fighting Crusaders&quot; were one of many Catholic high schools that originally competed in the now defunct T.C.I.L. (Texas Christian Interscholastic League). The league began in 1935 under the direction of Albert Mitchell (then principal of Central Catholic, San Antonio). Strake Jesuit&#x27;s last year of competition in the T.C.I.L. concluded when the league came to a close in the 1999–2000 athletic season with the baseball team capturing the final T.C.I.L. State Championship in any sport. After T.C.I.L. merged with TAPPS, both Strake Jesuit and Dallas Jesuit were not permitted to join as TAPPS believed those two schools were too powerful. From the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2003, the Crusaders competed as an independent in all sports.

They were admitted into the University Interscholastic League (U.I.L.), the public school athletic league, partly due to the efforts of Joe Nixon, a member of the Texas House of Representatives. Texas Senate Bill 1943 opened the UIL to Strake and Dallas Jesuit, which established rules to put those two schools on equal footing with public schools. After its admission into the U.I.L., Strake Jesuit began competing in its listed district of 19-5A in the fall of 2003. The Crusaders have won several district and regional championships along with a state championship, state runners-up, and state semi-finalists within the past eight years in the U.I.L. The &quot;Fighting Crusaders&quot; athletic department provides 14 different programs which include: baseball, basketball, cross-country, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, rugby, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, water polo, and wrestling.

The &quot;Houston Press&quot; ranked the U.I.L. realignment as the &quot;Best Way to Break In to the Big Time&quot; in 2003.

===Rivalry===
Despite moving to the U.I.L., Strake Jesuit had a storied rivalry with Saint Thomas High School (STH). Since its beginning in 1964, Strake Jesuit had a record of 24–29–1 against STH. However, as of 2020, both schools have announced the end of the annual competition and Strake Jesuit will now compete with Dallas Jesuit instead. This decision however was disliked by students and alumni from both schools.

<doc id="1240894" wikidata="Q3764980" url="?curid=1240894" title="Pradyumna">
<text>Pradyumna () is the eldest son of the Hindu deities Krishna and his wife , Rukmini. He is considered to be one of the four vyuha avatars of Vishnu. According to the Bhagavata Purana, Pradyumna was the reincarnation of Kamadeva, the god of love. The Mahabharata states that Pradyumna was a portion of Sanat Kumara.

The Harivamsa describes the chaturvyuha, consisisting of the Vrishni heroes Vāsudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, that would later be the basis for the Vaishnava concept of primary quadrupled expansion, or avatara.

Pradyumna is also another name of the Hindu god Vishnu, mentioned to be one of the 24 Keshava Namas (names).

==Birth and early life==

Pradyumna was the son of Krishna and the sixty-first grandson of Adinarayana. His mother was Rukmini, whom Krishna had eloped with from Vidarbha during her swayamvara on her request. Pradyumna was born in Dvaraka and was the reincarnation of the demigod Kamadeva, a deity who was burnt to ashes by the fury of Shiva. 

According to the Bhagavata Purana, within 10 days of Pradyumna&#x27;s birth, he was abducted by the asura Shambara. Recognising him as his foe, the asura threw him into the ocean. The infant was swallowed by a mighty fish, which was caught by fishermen and presented to Shambara. Shambara&#x27;s cooks discovered the child upon cutting the fish open. The child was given to Mayavati, who was the earthly incarnation of Rati. Recognising the son of Krishna as her divine consort, Rati fell in love with him once more. Years passed until Pradyumna flowered into adolescence, raised by Mayavati. When chastised by the deity for her amorous notions towards him, she explained to him the circumstances of his new birth. She bestowed Pradyumna with the mystic art of &quot;mahamaya&quot;, which dispelled all magic. The youth then summoned the asura to battle, where the latter first attacked him with a club, and followed with his daitya magic. Hundreds of weapons belonging to guhyakas, gandharvas, pisacas, and uragas (celestial snakes) were amassed to combat him, but all fell before the son of Krishna. Drawing his sharp-edged sword, he beheaded the asura. Accompanied with his wife, he descended upon the palace in Dvaraka like a cloud with lightning, the crowds of noble women mistaking his handsome countenance and bluish-black curling locks for Krishna himself. Rukmini, however, recognised him as her own son. Krishna manifested himself to the scene along with Vasudeva and Devaki, and together with the residents of Dvaraka, embraced the couple and rejoiced. 

==Marriages==

Pradyumna&#x27;s first wife was Mayavati, the incarnation of Kamadeva&#x27;s wife Rati. At first, Pradyumna objected, but upon explanation, he realised that she was, in fact, his eternal consort. He also married Rukmavati, the daughter of his maternal uncle, Rukmi. It is said that Princess Rukmavati found his valour, comeliness, and charm beyond words, and insisted on marrying him at her swayamvara. With her, he fathered, Krishna&#x27;s grandson and favourite, and also considered a &quot;vyuha&quot; avatar of Vishnu, Aniruddha. Prabhavati was an asura princess who fell in love with Pradyumna, and so he eloped with her.

==Role in Dvaraka==

Soon, Pradyumna became a constant companion of his father Krishna and was well-liked by the people of Dvaraka. Pradyumna was a mighty Maharathi warrior. He possessed the extremely rare Vaishnavastra, which was one of the most powerful weapons in the universe. He was one of the very few people to know the secret of the Chakravyuha. According to the Mahabharata, Pradyumna trained Abhimanyu and the Upapandavas in warfare when the Pandavas were in exile. But Pradyumna did not participate in the Kurukshetra War as he went on a pilgrimage with his uncle Balarama and the other Yadavas. He was, however, an active participant in the Ashvamedha Yagna, which was later conducted by Yudhishthira.
===Defence of Dvaraka===
Pradyumna defended Dvaraka against Shalva, the king of the Shalva Kingdom, along with his father, uncle and brothers. In the Harivamsa, Pradyumna alone repelled the attack of Jarasandha.

==Death==
Pradyumna was later killed in an intoxicated brawl, along with all the other members of the Yadava clan. His grandson, Vajra, was the only survivor of Yadu lineage after this incident.

==Epithets==

One of the epithets of Pradyumna in literature, such as in Harivamsa 99, is &quot;Makaradhvaja&quot;, meaning &quot;he whose banner or standard is the crocodile&quot;. A pillar capital with the effigy of a Makara crocodile found at Besnagar near the Heliodorus pillar dedicated to Vasudeva, is also attributed to Pradyumna. In the Mahabharata, the Makara is associated with Krishna&#x27;s son and Kamadeva, the God of Love, suggesting that they are identical.

==Descendants==
As per the Bhagavata Purana, Canto 10, Chapter 61, Aniruddha was the son of Pradyumna and Rukmavati. He was later abducted by Usha (daughter of Bana asura and granddaughter of Mahabali), who wished to marry him. Usha&#x27;s father, Banasura, however, imprisoned Aniruddha, creating a battle between Krishna and Shiva. In the battle, Pradyumna defeated Shiva&#x27;s son Kartikeya, who fled on his peacock. At the end of the war, Banasura lost, and Aniruddha and Usha were married. Aniruddha is said to have been very much like his grandfather Krishna, to the extent that some consider him to be a &quot;jana avatar&quot;, an avatar of Vishnu. Aniruddha&#x27;s son was Vajra. Vajra was known to be an invincible warrior and was the only survivor of the Yadu Dynasty after the Yadus&#x27; battle. According to some sources, Vajra then had 16 idols of Krishna and other gods carved from a rare, imperishable stone called Braja and built temples to house these idols in and around Mathura so as to feel the presence of Krishna. It is said that Pradyumna and Arjuna were equivalent in their skills.

== Texts ==
The Hindu version of the history of Pradyumna is mentioned in Bhagavata Purana and Hari Vamsa.

The Jain version of the story of Pradyumna is mentioned in the &quot;Pradyumna-charitra&quot; (poem in 18 canons) of Rajchandra, written in 1878 AD.

<doc id="1240897" wikidata="Q7637496" url="?curid=1240897" title="Summer in the Yukon">
<text>Summer in the Yukon is a 1992 compilation album by Jane Siberry. It was released only in the United Kingdom.

In Canada, the compilation &quot;A Collection 1984-1989&quot; was released instead. That album contains some of the same songs, but includes other songs not appearing on &quot;Summer in the Yukon&quot;.

Conversely, &quot;Summer in the Yukon&quot; includes tracks not appearing on the Canadian compilation, including two tracks from Siberry&#x27;s 1981 self-titled debut and her most famous song, &quot;Calling All Angels&quot;. That song, a duet with k.d. lang which was recorded for the soundtrack to Wim Wenders&#x27; &quot;Until the End of the World&quot;, had not yet been included on an album of new material by Siberry. It subsequently appeared on her 1993 album &quot;When I Was a Boy&quot;, and later appeared on a second film soundtrack, &quot;Pay It Forward&quot;. The version of &quot;The Life Is The Red Wagon&quot; is the single version, whereas &quot;A Collection 1984-1989&quot; features the more stripped-down album version.

<text>Shambara (), also known as Shambarasura () is an asura featured in Hindu mythology. He abducted the infant Pradyumna, the son of Krishna and Rukmini, and attempted to drown him. Pradyumna was raised by Mayavati (Rati), Shambarasura&#x27;s cook, and the consort of the deity&#x27;s true form of Kamadeva. After eventually growing up, Pradyumna killed Shambarasura and returned to his family in Dvaraka, along with his consort.

==Legend==

Kamadeva was burnt to ashes formerly by Shiva&#x27;s anger. Kamadeva was later born as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna and Rukmini. The asura Shambarasura learned of the prophecy that Pradyumna was born to kill him. Shambarasura came to the palace of Dvaraka in the disguise of a woman, took away Pradyumna, who was hardly ten days old at that time, and threw him into the ocean. Pradyumna was swallowed by a large fish. Shambarasura later bought the same fish from a fisherman. Mayavati, the incarnation of Rati, who worked in Shambarasura&#x27;s kitchen as a cook, found Pradyumna inside the fish. She recognised him as the reincarnation of her consort Kamadeva, and raised him until he was an adolescent.

== Battle with Shambarasura ==
After Pradyumna grew up, Mayavati revealed to him his true identity as well as her own, as well as his purpose on earth, which was to slay Shambarasura. Pradyumna fought with Shambarasura, who employed the magic of the asuras. Rati also knew daitya magic, and taught Pradyumna how to neutralise the asura&#x27;s magic with her knowledge of &quot;mahāmāyā vidyā&quot;. Pradyumna severed Shambarasura&#x27;s head with one blow of his sword. Pradyumna then went to Dvaraka, and was reunited with his family.

<text>Willetton Senior High School (WSHS) is a public secondary school in Willetton, Western Australia, south of the Perth central business district and east of the port of Fremantle. The school opened in February 1977 with 77 students. It is one of the largest schools in Western Australia, with enrolled students as of .

The student catchment area for WSHS encompasses the suburb of Willetton and part of the suburb of Bull Creek, which is shared with Leeming Senior High School and Rossmoyne Senior High School.

== Campus ==
WSHS covers an area of approximately , located adjacent to Burrendah Primary School and Castlereagh School. There are seven main buildings, along with numerous transportable buildings, some many years old. A $5 million upgrade was completed in 2008 that resulted in the construction of a new gymnasium and several new facilities.

WSHS underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation and redevelopment that commenced in 2014. In the second semester of 2014, asbestos contamination was detected after construction workers found pieces of asbestos had fallen off the roof of a school building slated for demolition. The school was closed for a week so the site could be inspected. Teachers were sent to work from North Lake Senior High School where they connected with students via the internet so that classes could continue.

The following phase of the redevelopment, involving the construction of another block of classrooms, commenced in February 2022. Construction was completed in early 2024.

== Academic rankings ==
The Year 12 cohorts at Willetton perform consistently well in the WACE school rankings, and the school ranks well when compared to other schools in Western Australia.



In 2017, Andreea Ioan won the Beazley Medal for the top ranked Vocational Education and Training student in Western Australia.

== Special programs ==
WSHS is one of 20 schools offering the Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) with entry through a centrally organised testing program. Entry to the science-focused Talented And Gifted (TAG) program is managed at the school level. The school offers a specialist fine arts course for Years 8 to 10 and a successful senior school art program. A specialist course in computing was the first of its kind in WA and has recently been expanded to include a multimedia stream. A specialist basketball course runs from Years 8 to 11 and offers students a TAFE Certificate II in Sport Coaching and Sport and Recreation. Both male and female teams have won multiple national championships. As of June 2019, WSHS introduced a program called the eSports Club where all students can prepare for a sports competition and practice against other local schools. Some of the team names include WSHS eSports and DLGC.

===Basketball Team Achievements===

====Championship Men (Open)====

: Third Place: 2017, 2018

== International relations ==
WSHS has a sister school relationship with the High School and Junior High School of University of Hyogo located in Kamigōri, Ako District, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. Cultural exchanges between the two schools commenced in 1995 and a collaborative international partnership was established in 2005. WSHS maintains relationships that provide opportunities for French and Italian language students to study overseas.

==Incidents==
On 11 May 2020, a 16-year-old male student was charged with illegal possession of a firearm after taking a gel blaster and a knife into the school. Crime Stoppers received a tipoff regarding the gun before the officers were called to the school at about 2:30pm. In a statement &quot;the Education Department said [...] no other students were impacted and the situation was well managed.&quot;

On 5 May 2022, a female student pled guilty to a charge of attempted murder after she stabbed a female teacher at WSHS in November 2021. The girl had a female accomplice, who pled not guilty to the same charge. Although the intent was to wound the teacher fatally, the teacher was not injured seriously, receiving a wound near the left armpit. The attacking girl was 14 years old at the time of the stabbing, and the girl that assisted was 13. In September 2022 the attacker was &quot;sentenced to three years and one month detention, but will be eligible for parole after serving 15 months, a sentence [...] lower than it could have been due to the poor conditions at Banksia Hill&quot;; the crime carries &quot;a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.&quot; The accomplice was sentenced 12 days earlier &quot;to 11 months in juvenile detention, but she may be released after serving half of that&quot;, with this sentence also lower than it could have been because of the poor conditions at Banksia Hill.

<doc id="1240905" wikidata="Q331733" url="?curid=1240905" title="Brian Welch">
<text>Brian Philip Welch (born June 19, 1970), also known by his stage name Head, is an American musician. He is a guitarist and founding member of the nu metal band Korn and his solo project Love and Death, where he also provides vocals. Along with fellow Korn guitarist James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer, Welch helped develop Korn&#x27;s distinctive sound (a mix of sirenlike shards of dissonant guitar that mimicked a turntablist&#x27;s various effects and rumbling down-tuned riffing) that defined the nu metal aesthetic beginning in the mid-&#x27;90s.

After becoming a Christian, Welch left the band in 2005 to focus on life as a father and to pursue his own solo career. He released his debut Christian album, &quot;Save Me from Myself&quot;, in 2008. He reunited with Korn on-stage at the Carolina Rebellion in May 2012 for the first time in seven years; Welch officially announced in May 2013 that he was rejoining the band. Welch and Munky were ranked at No. 26 of &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time.

==Early life==
Welch was born on June 19, 1970 in either Harbor City, Los Angeles or Torrance, California, and was raised in Bakersfield. He was different from most kids, and was bullied in school. He liked music, and was a big Ozzy Osbourne fan. Originally, Welch expressed interest in playing the drums, but his father convinced him to play the guitar so he would not have to haul a drum kit around. He began playing the guitar at the age of 10. His first guitar was a Peavey Mystic, which he referred to in his book &quot;Save Me from Myself&quot; as &quot;maybe the most metal-looking guitar you have ever seen.&quot;

Describing how he got his nickname &quot;The Head&quot;, Welch stated,
: &quot;Guys said my head looked like it was too big for my body, and so they started calling me &#x27;Head.&#x27; I guess it stuck&quot;.

==Korn (1993–2005, 2013–present)==
===Formation===
Korn formed after the group L.A.P.D. broke up due to singer Richard Morrill&#x27;s drug addiction. Musicians Reginald Arvizu, James Shaffer, and David Silveria wanted to continue, and they hired Welch to play guitar in their new band named &quot;Creep&quot;. In early 1993, the band took notice of vocalist Jonathan Davis after seeing his band Sexart and attempted to recruit him. Davis initially did not want to join the band, but after consulting a psychic he changed his mind and auditioned. After Davis was hired, the group decided to rename themselves. &quot;Jonathan had an immediate idea for a new name. He suggested that we call the band &quot;Korn,&quot; and we all liked it. It sounded kinda creepy because it reminded us of that horror movie &quot;Children of the Corn&quot;&quot;.

Starting with Korn&#x27;s self-titled debut album and with subsequent albums &quot;Life Is Peachy&quot;, &quot;Follow The Leader&quot;, &quot;Issues&quot;, &quot;Untouchables&quot;, and &quot;Take A Look in the Mirror&quot;, the band gradually became one of the top-selling nu metal groups, earning $25 million in royalty payments and selling out arenas. In January 1995, Welch&#x27;s wife Rebekah gave birth to a daughter, but they decided to give her up for adoption. When she got pregnant again, they decided to keep the child. On July 6, 1998, Welch&#x27;s wife gave birth to their second daughter, Jennea Marie Welch. The band was scheduled to be on the UK version of Ozzfest, but dropped out so that Welch could be by his wife&#x27;s side. He and his wife later divorced and Welch had custody of their daughter. The two reside in Arizona. Despite being divorced, Welch kept in touch with his ex-wife until her death in June 2021.

By 2003, Welch had become addicted to drugs. He would prepare for tours by stashing as much methamphetamine as he could in vitamin capsules, deodorant containers, and his clothes. According to Welch, the band members also suffered personal battles with addiction: &quot;We were only sober for just a couple of hours a day in Korn. Every day. And then when you come home and you&#x27;ve got to deal with real life and your wife isn&#x27;t having that, crap goes down.&quot; Despite his dreams coming true, Welch did not enjoy the touring life with Korn. You travel, you get to another town, you play a show and you do it again. You try to just be at peace but even a big, huge band like Korn, playing in front of thousands of people, it can get lonely. You feel like you&#x27;re a trucker and you&#x27;re traveling with a bunch of truckers. You can&#x27;t connect with people except for the ones that you&#x27;re with because the ones you party with after the show, you don&#x27;t know them and then you&#x27;re gone. When everyone&#x27;s drunk, you&#x27;re like &#x27;Alright. Later.&#x27;

===Departure from Korn===
On February 22, 2005, Korn&#x27;s management announced that after almost 12 years, Welch had left Korn, citing that he had &quot;...chosen the Lord Jesus Christ as his savior, and will be dedicating his musical pursuits to that end.&quot; In a 2009 radio interview with The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Welch explained: &quot;I was walking one day, just doing my Rock &amp; Roll thing making millions of bucks, you know success and everything, addicted to drugs and then the next day I had Revelation of Christ and I was like, everything changes right now!&quot; On March 10, 2005, Welch was baptized in the Jordan River with a group of believers from his church in Bakersfield, California. He has declared that he has rid himself of all drugs in his &quot;own personal rehab&quot; with God, in which he had checked into a hotel room and sat in his bed for hours.

Welch and Davis had attacked each other in the media since the former&#x27;s departure. After Welch said that Davis and the rest of Korn cared only about money, Davis responded in kind, opening a rift between them that has since been resolved. In an interview in which Welch was asked about his book and Korn&#x27;s reaction to the book and the attacks in the media he made earlier at the band:

They heard that I&#x27;d written it, and there was rumors going around in Hollywood that I was totally trashing them and that it was a &#x27;tell all&#x27; book about everything they did and I did. And so they actually wrote two songs on their new album bashing me about the book. But once I heard that they were concerned about the book, I sent them a copy and put a note in there and said, &#x27;I love you guys. I didn&#x27;t trash you like people say. Read it yourselves. It is what it is.&#x27; And now they&#x27;re doing interviews, and I&#x27;ve read that they&#x27;re totally cool with the book, and it&#x27;s not what they thought it was going to be. So everyone&#x27;s happy. But, now they&#x27;ve got two songs hating on me on their record. But it&#x27;s cool. It&#x27;s all good. I love them, they love me. I think maybe I deserved those songs because of some of the stuff that I said after I quit the band. So it&#x27;s all good.
In July 2005, Welch appeared on CNN&#x27;s feature-format program &quot;People in the News&quot;, where he admitted to having been addicted to alcohol, methamphetamine, Xanax, and sleeping pills before being introduced to the Christian faith. Following his conversion to Christianity, Welch went to some of the more poverty-stricken areas of India to build orphanages, or &quot;Head Homes&quot;. In a podcast with Headbanger&#x27;s Blog, on May 30, 2008, Korn vocalist Jonathan Davis expressed interest in playing with Welch on the band&#x27;s upcoming album, but stated that it is not likely. In late 2008, Welch, among other celebrities such as Josh Hamilton and Greg Ellis, appeared in testimonial videos called I Am Second in which he shares his story of recovering from drug use with the help of his faith in Jesus Christ. In September 2009, Korn guitarist Munky, in an interview with Altitude TV, alleged that the band had denied a request by Welch to rejoin the outfit. In the interview, Munky claimed:

Brian actually contacted us recently and wanted to come back to the band. And it was not the right time... for us. We&#x27;re doing well, and it&#x27;s kind of like... It&#x27;s kind of like if you divorced your wife and she went on and she stayed successful and her career flourished, and you go back and [say], &#x27;My gosh, she&#x27;s still hot. Baby, can we get back together?&#x27; &#x27;Wait a minute... All the stuff&#x27;s been divided, and it&#x27;s like...&#x27; I don&#x27;t see it happening right now. Shortly after, Welch responded to the statement via his Myspace and official website, denying the claims:

I recently learned of an interview that Munky gave where he said that I came to Korn and asked to be taken back in the band. That&#x27;s definitely not a complete and accurate picture. The full truth is that for about a year... Korn&#x27;s managers have been requesting my manager to work on getting me back into Korn. The calls were initiated by Korn&#x27;s managers, not my manager. I shut the door on their requests many, many times over the last several months.

As far as Munky&#x27;s comment that &#x27;everything has been divided already&#x27; that is also not accurate. In fact, from January 2005 when I left, and for the next 4 years, Korn failed to pay to me royalties that were due me on records that I did with them. However, I don&#x27;t believe this was done intentionally. We are trying to be patient and work with their management to get the financial issues resolved so that &#x27;everything can be divided as we agreed long ago in our contracts.&#x27;
Welch told &quot;Alternative Press&quot; magazine that it was at this time that he had essentially become broke because of bad business deals, mismanagement, and philanthropy. Welch stated there was a time that he was unable to pay his bills and resorted to finding loose change around his rental home to cover essentials. A royalty cheque was released to him not long after, allowing him some stability.

On June 17, 2011, Welch had a private interview, shot by Carson Bankord of Red Rocks Church in Golden, Colorado, in which he discussed his conversion experience. In an interview with Loudwire in November 2011, Head confirmed that he and the other members of Korn are still on good terms.

=== Reunion with Korn ===
On May 5, 2012, at the Carolina Rebellion in Rockingham, NC, Welch was there originally as a special guest for a performance by Red. Later that evening, Korn was performing on the main stage and Jonathan Davis brought out Welch as a special guest to close their act, marking the first time Welch had performed with Korn since his departure in 2005.

Welch performed with the band at Rock on the Range in May 2013, as well as Rock Am Ring and Rock Im Park in June 2013 in Germany, as well as Download Festival in England.
Welch rejoined Korn on May 2, 2013, and recorded his first album with the band in ten years, &quot;The Paradigm Shift&quot;.

Welch has shown support for the LGBT community. In 2016, after receiving backlash by some Christian fans for praying at a concert for transgender people, he wrote a Facebook post criticizing the judgemental nature of certain Christians and encouraged them to &quot;open their hearts&quot;.

In 2021, Welch stated that while he is still a Christian, he had gone &quot;too far with it&quot;, feeling like he had turned it into another addiction. However, in another interview he added that this quote was taken out of context by media outlets and that he had not renounced Christianity like they were reporting, only toning down in approach. He maintains that faith in Christ is still the foundation of his life.

==Solo career (2005–present)==

===&quot;Save Me from Myself&quot;===
As early as a week following his departure from Korn, Welch claimed through press that a solo record was close to being completed, although there was no release date given, nor had he yet signed on with a label to distribute the record.

A number of demos from these early sessions surfaced on peer-to-peer networks, among them &quot;A Cheap Name&quot;, a song directed at rapper 50 Cent. He also recorded several other songs, including &quot;Dream&quot; and &quot;A Letter to Dimebag&quot;, the latter being an instrumental tribute to &quot;Dimebag&quot; Darrell Abbott, guitarist for heavy metal bands Pantera and Damageplan. In his autobiography, Welch mentions the songs &quot;Washed by Blood,&quot; &quot;Save Me from Myself,&quot; and &quot;Rebel&quot;, which all have made the final track listing for the album.

In an interview with MTV News, Welch clarified a few things. Primarily, he was concerned that it was reported that his new songs wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;Christian music&quot;.

During his stay in Israel with members of the Valley Bible Fellowship of Bakersfield, California, Welch continued to write songs for his solo effort, confident that the music would speak for itself. &quot;I want to make music that will help people. I want to use every dime of the money I make off the songs to build skate parks for kids,&quot; he said. &quot;My life now is about helping kids.&quot; Originally, Welch contacted Fieldy of Korn to produce the album, but Fieldy made no response.
On March 15, 2008, Welch announced he had founded a record company with Mark Nawara and Greg Shanabeger called Driven Music Group. The company&#x27;s artists are distributed by Warner Music Group and Rykodisc. Welch also announced that he had re-dubbed his album &quot;Save Me from Myself&quot;, after his autobiography of the same name. Following this, his official MySpace profile went online, and the domain name for his official website was moved from www.headtochrist.com to www.brianheadwelch.net. Welch also revealed that a tour was expected to follow the release of &quot;Save Me from Myself&quot;.

For the album, Welch contributed the majority of the instruments, but also hired other contributors, including rhythm guitarist Archie J. Muise Jr., bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Josh Freese, for assistance. The first single, &quot;Flush&quot;, was released on July 5, 2008, at Cornerstone Festival in Bushnell, Illinois, and a music video directed by Frankie Nasso followed on September 5.

Originally, Welch planned for the project to follow the &quot;Head&quot; name, but was persuaded otherwise so as not to be sued by the tennis equipment manufacturer of the same name. Though the project has since been dubbed &quot;Brian Head Welch&quot;, the album art continues to carry the imprint of the project&#x27;s original title. The project&#x27;s true title does appear on the spines of the packaging.

Of the album, Welch said: &quot;I knew it was going to be nothing near as big as Korn, but I was proud of it. It&#x27;s got some heavy riffs and it&#x27;s got a lot more emotion than I&#x27;ve ever put in music. I&#x27;m an emotional guy (and) it was cool to be able to put it in there. It was cool how people were surprised by it. A lot of people thought I was gonna come out with some &#x27;Kumbaya,&#x27; Jesus music.&quot;

For his live touring band, Welch held closed and open auditions to recruit members. Members posted videos online of them performing Welch&#x27;s solo songs and the list was narrowed down to a few who did a personal audition with Welch. Eventually, the lineup was finalized to include Brian Ruedy (Keyboards), Scott &quot;SVH&quot; Von Heldt (guitar &amp; backing vocals), Ralph Patlan (guitar), Michael &quot;Valentine&quot; (bass), and Dan Johnson (drums).

Along with many other artists, including ex-Korn bandmates Fieldy and Munky, Welch contributed to &quot;A Song for Chi&quot;. The instrumental track was to benefit Deftones bassist Chi Cheng, who was in a coma but later died. All the profits benefited the &quot;One Love for Chi&quot; foundation. This was the first time Head was involved with any of his former bandmates since leaving the band.

In 2009, Welch joined the 9th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians&#x27; careers.

On July 2, 2009, Welch headlined the mainstage of the Cornerstone Festival and on August 29, Welch headlined the Exit Concert in Las Vegas at the Thomas and Mack Arena with Blindside and Flyleaf. On July 3, 2010, he was featured on the Fringe stage of the Creation Festival.

Welch has often described his solo project as being received very differently from Korn. Despite his fame with Korn, he has compared his solo project to &#x27;starting over&#x27;: &quot;It&#x27;s a struggle, because one show I&#x27;ll have a thousand people there, and the next show there&#x27;ll be a hundred. When the hundred is there, I&#x27;m like, &#x27;There&#x27;s one or two people who really need us to be here,&#x27; and it should be focused on them and I shouldn&#x27;t care if there&#x27;s a big crowd or not, but I struggle with it. I was in Korn and we sold like 25 million albums, and I can&#x27;t even fill this little bar up? Of all those fans, 300–400 people can&#x27;t just show up here? It&#x27;s like starting over, totally.&quot;

&quot;Save Me From Myself&quot; peaked at No. 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 while also peaking at 13 and 21 on the Hard Rock and Rock charts, respectively.

===The Whosoevers===
In 2008, Welch became a principal organizer and representative of The Whosoevers, an outreach organization and product line co-founded by Sonny Sandoval of P.O.D. and public speaker, Ryan Ries. The group includes musicians in other alternative/nu metal bands such as Lacey Mosely of Flyleaf, as well as freestyle motocross athlete, Ronnie Faisst. Sandoval and Ries speak publicly worldwide in settings such as schools, rehab centers, parks, conferences and youth events inspiring individuals who are eager to discover their purpose. 

===Unreleased songs===
According to an interview with the Great Falls Tribune, Welch returned to the studio to begin work on a second album. Concerning his career at the time, Welch said that &quot;I feel like I was created to do what I&#x27;m doing right now. Everything I learned in my life before I changed it all over, it set me up for what I&#x27;m doing now. That&#x27;s the satisfaction. That&#x27;s the peace in knowing, without a doubt, that you&#x27;re on the road you&#x27;re supposed to be on. There&#x27;s nothing more content than that.&quot;

In November 2009, Welch announced that his second effort would be produced by Grammy-nominee Rob Graves (Red, Pillar), and that the band was recording in Nashville, expecting to complete the record by February 2010. Of recording with Graves, Welch stated that &quot;the production on our new record is going awesome with Rob Graves. Our goal is to get the record completely mixed and mastered by the first part of February, and released immediately thereafter. My band is together, helping with the recording, and we will be ready for a full U.S. tour beginning early next year.&quot;
Welch also signed an international representational deal with William Morris Endeavor Entertainment. On signing the deal with WMEE, Welch said that &quot;I&#x27;m really excited about my deal with William Morris Endeavor, and I&#x27;m honored to be on the roster of one of the largest and most storied agencies in existence. I would like to publicly thank Ember Rigsby Tanksley and her entire team at WMEE for their belief in what I am trying to do. I feel like this is the final piece in the puzzle that we have been working on to take us to the next level.&quot;

In addition, Welch signed with Union Entertainment Group, Inc., for management in early 2010.

According to Welch in April 2010, he has finished a demo of a record for the songs, but has yet to re-enter the studio to complete the recording process as he is on tour in the United States. The band has been playing a number of unreleased songs live from the demo of the record including the following songs:
* Runaway
* Bury Me, Resurrected
* Take This From Me
* Torment
The CD was expected to be released sometime during April 2012, But it has yet to be released.

On March 25, 2011, Welch started a North American tour with Decyfer Down, The Letter Black, and The Wedding.

===&quot;Chemicals&quot; EP===

Welch and his band went into the studio with Jasen Rauch in early/mid-2011 to start recording an EP. The lead single, &quot;Paralyzed&quot;, was released on October 4, 2011. The &quot;making of&quot; video for &quot;Paralyzed&quot; was posted on Welch&#x27;s Facebook fan page, along with a streaming of the full &quot;Paralyzed&quot; track. The music video for &quot;Paralyzed&quot; was released on Revolver&#x27;s website on November 8, 2011. In February 2012, Welch announced that the EP would be released under the name &quot;Love and Death&quot;, the new moniker for his solo project.

===Split with record label===
On March 22, 2011, Welch got into a legal battle with his own label, Driven Music Group, and former managers Greg Shanaberger and Mark Nawara. According to Welch, Shanaberger structured Head Touring, Welch&#x27;s touring company under Driven Music, to give himself and Nawara share of control and revenue. Shanaberger&#x27;s agreements required Welch to buy merchandise through Head Touring at an inflated price which was far above industry standards, &quot;for which Shanaberger and Nawara reaped the benefits,&quot; claims Welch. Welch also claims that Shanaberger attempted to hide &quot;his fraudulent, unethical and illegal behavior&quot; by listing his then fiancée as a shareholder. Welch claims that the agreements were &quot;predatory, unconscionable, and constitutes self-dealing&quot; and that they were written with the intention to &quot;rob Welch of his master recordings, which were worth upwards of $600,000.&quot; Welch is seeking punitive damages, the appointment of a receiver, the dissolution of Driven Music Group, and costs.

===Love and Death===

In February 2012, Welch announced that he was re-branding his music under the name Love and Death, effectively forming a band under that name. In an official statement, Welch elaborated on the name and the change:
The name &quot;Love and Death&quot; symbolizes everything we&#x27;ve been through as a band over the last few years. We love this band so much and we&#x27;ll go through hell to connect with our fans. Many people have confused my speaking dates and our band dates because they were both being booked as Brian Head Welch. I have wanted to use a band name for branding my music for a few years. Now with the new music coming out, its time to really separate the things I do. I want the music to be about music. I will still be doing public speaking under Brian Head Welch. I am happy that all the confusion will be over.
The band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Chemicals&quot;, was released in March, while an EP of the same name was released on April 24, 2012.

A full-length album, &quot;Between Here &amp; Lost&quot;, was released on January 22, 2013.

Despite rejoining Korn permanently in 2013, Welch has clarified that Love and Death will remain an active project. On May 17, 2016, Love and Death released a new single, &quot;Lo Lamento&quot;, as a free-download with the purchase of his book, &quot;With My Eyes Wide Open: Miracles &amp; Mistakes on My Way Back to KoRn&quot;.

===HolyName===
Welch was among the live lineup for metal worship project HolyName, a group led by former Sleeping Giant frontman Tommy Green. Their live recording, &quot;Initiation&quot;, performed in Chicago, was recorded and released in July 27, 2023.

==Other media==

In 2003, Welch made an appearance at WWE&#x27;s flagship event WrestleMania 19 performing with Limp Bizkit in their song Rollin&#x27; (Air Raid Vehicle), Welch filled in as Limp Bizkit&#x27;s touring guitarist for several dates in Spring of 2003.

On December 6, 2023, Welch unveiled a new record label he created with longtime manager David Williams, and announced Christian Rock band Spoken as his first signees.

==Musical equipment==
Welch&#x27;s first guitar was a Peavey Mystic, which he later sold along with a practice amp to future bandmate James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer. Throughout his career with Korn, Welch almost exclusively played Ibanez guitars, most of which were assembled at the Ibanez LA Custom Shop.

During his later days with Korn, Welch and Munky played their own signature guitar, the Ibanez K7. Since leaving Korn, Welch mostly uses custom-built baritone guitars from Ibanez, making use of the RG and, at the time, newly introduced RGD shape. After rejoining Korn in 2013, Welch received several custom-made Ibanez seven-string RGDs.

In 2017, Welch switched endorsement from Ibanez to ESP Guitars after being with the former for 24 years. He released his first ESP signature model called the SH-7ET. In the beginning of 2025, Welch switched back to Ibanez.

Welch&#x27;s pedalboard has grown considerably from his early days with Korn. He considers experimenting and trying out new pedals to be one of his favorite things to do when working in a studio.

<text>Robert Henry Rimmer (March 14, 1917 – August 1, 2001) was an American writer who authored several books, most notably &quot;The Harrad Experiment&quot;, which was made into a film in 1973.

The recurring theme in almost all of Rimmer&#x27;s writing was a criticism of the assumption of monogamy as a societal norm. They explore various ways of organizing life, through laws or other means, to facilitate non-monogamous relationships.

==Early life and education==
Robert Henry Rimmer was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 14, 1917, to Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Henry Rimmer, owner of the Relief Printing Corporation, and Blanche Rosealma, née Rochefort, Rimmer in Boston, Massachusetts. He graduated from Bates College with a multi-disciplinary degree in English, Psychology and Philosophy and later obtained an MBA from Harvard.

==Career==
Rimmer served in World War II. When his enlistment was up, he returned to the U.S. and took a position in the family printing business. He stated, &quot;Little did I know as a growing fetus in Blanche&#x27;s womb that twenty-nine years later Relief Printing Corporation would own me, and FH, as I began to call him (&quot;Dad&quot; seemed inappropriate when I was finally in business with him), would be subtly controlling my life.&quot; 25 years passed before he wrote his first novel.

His relationship with his father, especially, and his mother are reflected in some of his works, such as the novel &quot;The Rebellion of Yale Marrat&quot;. Rimmer stated, &quot;I transformed portions of my realities into fiction. Pat Marrat, for example, is a fleshier, cigar-smoking version of FH. The conflict between Matt Godwin and his father in The Immoral Reverend has many similarities.&quot;

Rimmer has stated that his greatest influences came from reading books, since this was the only real available entertainment in his developmental years, especially reading of his heroes such as Benjamin Franklin and the &quot;Bound to Rise&quot; heroes of Horatio Alger, as well as Hans Christian Andersen, Mark Twain, and the unexpurgated &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;.

Rimmer died in Quincy, Massachusetts, on August 1, 2001.

<doc id="1240913" wikidata="Q1877197" url="?curid=1240913" title="Eynsford">
<text>Eynsford ( or ) is a village and civil parish in the Sevenoaks District of Kent, England. It is located south east of Swanley, and south of Dartford, which is the village&#x27;s postal town. Eynsford forms part of the London commuter belt. 

The village including its farmland and woods occupies the northern half of the triangle formed by three motorways in west Kent barring its very northernmost part which is Farningham. This area is undulating and has a large minority of woodland. In the south of the parish is Lullingstone, much of which was owned for many centuries by the large, late medieval Lullingstone Castle, whereas other parts of the village were owned by Eynsford Castle, which is older. Well before the founding of the Kingdom of England, Lullingstone Roman villa was founded in this part of the parish, which is open to the public today. The Darent Valley Path takes in a cross-section of the area.

==The village==

Eynsford is first mentioned in writing in 864, as &quot;Egenes homme&quot;. The derivation is unclear, but one possibility is that it represents &quot;Ægen&#x27;s river-meadow&quot;, from the Old English hamm &quot;river-meadow, enclosure&quot;. In 1801 the village had the highest population in the Dartford area, at 841 persons.
In the centre of the village is a ford over the river, with a picturesque hump-back bridge alongside. There are many old buildings including the 16th-century Plough Inn and the Old Mill. The church is dedicated to St Martin. In about 1163, Thomas Becket is reputed to have excommunicated William de Eynsford, the owner of Eynsford castle. The excommunication was cancelled by King Henry II and the issue became part of the quarrel that led to Becket&#x27;s murder in 1170.

John Wesley is thought to have preached here: he was a friend of the then vicar of Shoreham, the next village along the valley. The Wesley Stone by the bridge commemorates the spot.

It was near Eynsford village (at Austin Lodge) that Percy Pilcher constructed and successfully flew lightweight gliders. On 30 September 1899, having completed his triplane, he had intended to demonstrate it to a group of onlookers and potential sponsors in a field near Stanford Hall. However, days before, the engine crankshaft had broken and, so as not to disappoint his guests, he decided to fly the Hawk instead. The weather was stormy and rainy, but by 4 pm Pilcher decided the weather was good enough to fly. Whilst flying, the tail snapped and Pilcher plunged to the ground: he died two days later from his injuries with his triplane having never been publicly flown.

Another famous resident was Arthur Mee who built and lived in Eynsford Hill, a grand house overlooking the village. Mee edited both the weekly Children&#x27;s Newspaper and the Children&#x27;s Encyclopaedia, in which the design and construction of Eynsford Hill was chronicled. Whether the name of Eliza Doolittle&#x27;s husband Freddy Eynsford-Hill in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; is connected to the house is a matter of conjecture.

The village was scandalised in the 1920s by the antics of composers E.J. Moeran and Peter Warlock who rented a house there; Warlock&#x27;s habit of riding his motorbike round the village naked was matched by his housemate&#x27;s singing sea shanties on a Sunday morning to try to drown out the congregation in the Baptist chapel next door. Although the time spent in Eynsford was productive for Warlock, Moeran never really recovered.

Graham Sutherland lived for many years in the 17th century Willow Cottage opposite the old village school.

The parish was part of Axstane Hundred and later Dartford Rural District.

===Eynsford Castle===
Dating from 1088, Eynsford Castle is one of the most complete Norman castles in England. Ransacked in the 14th century, it fell into decay. For years it was used as dog kennels by the Hart-Dyke family of nearby Lullingstone Castle. It is now in the care of English Heritage and open to the public

===Lullingstone Castle===

Not a true castle, but a manor house, built in the 15th century and substantially rebuilt in the 18th century by Sir Percyvall Hart in honour of Queen Anne, who often stayed there. In 1875 Sir William Hart-Dyke and two of his friends framed the rules of lawn tennis at Lullingstone and first played the game there, using a ladder supported on two barrels for a net. The silk farm that supplied Queen Elizabeth II with silk for her wedding dress was situated here, though by the time the Lullingstone Silk Farm provided Lady Diana Spencer with silk for hers, it had moved to Dorset.

In 2004 the current heir to the estate, Tom Hart Dyke, created the World Garden of Plants in the grounds from a design made in 2000 while he was held captive by rebels in Colombia. The walled garden is laid out like a map of the world, containing some 10 000 species planted to create the shapes of their areas of origin. Both house and garden are open to the public, and the garden in 2005 won the British Guild of Travel Writers&#x27; &#x27;Best UK Tourism Project&#x27; award.

===Lullingstone Roman Villa===

Lullingstone Roman villa was discovered in 1939, and contains some of the finest excavated remains of a Roman villa in Britain, including a Romano-Christian chapel.

===Wildlife=== 

The Eastern areas flanking the Darent were largely grazed and kept open from encroaching scrub and woodland up until the 1950s. The ensuing changes and scrub encroachment meant a loss of habitat for many downland butterfly species. This decline was repeated in the bird and reptile populations. Stirling clearance efforts ensued along Preston Hill and the flanks of Lower Austin Lodge, though without enough consistency to make a substantial difference. The shallower Western slopes of the Darent up to Lullingstone Golf Course still have a substantial diversity of butterflies and birds, the lockdown period on 2020 even encouraging quite unsuspected birds like the Wheatear to take up spring and summer residence.

==Eynsford on television==
&quot;20 Miles from Piccadilly Circus&quot; consisted of six half-hour episodes about various aspects of life in the village. The show was released in 1994 and initially aired only in the Carlton Television region, although the first three episodes were later repeated on Channel 4.

&quot;Save Lullingstone Castle&quot; was a six-part series by Keo Films, aired between 4 April and 9 May 2006, on BBC2. It followed the fortunes of Tom Hart Dyke as he developed the World Map of Plants and attempted to thereby turn the fortunes of the estate. A second series, &quot;Return to Lullingstone Castle&quot; aired between 19 March and 23 April 2007.

In the movie &quot;Love Actually&quot;, the vicar at Eynsford church at the time played the vicar that married Juliet and Peter.

For ITV&#x27;s 2021 comedy drama The Larkins, Eynsford featured as the fictional village of Littlechurch, and was used for a number of filming locations including The Village Hall, Castle Hotel, The Five Bells Pub and various spots around Eynsford Riverside and Ford

==Eynsford Baptist Church==

In 1775, A Baptist preacher, Mr J. Morris, opened his house in Eynsford for the preaching of the Gospel. This was the beginning of a Baptist community, which grew despite opposition from the established church. In 1802, it is recorded in the history of the church that when Mr Rogers came to be pastor &quot;great difficulty was experienced in obtaining lodgings for the young Minister, that at one time the prejudice against a Baptist Minister was so strong that the people with whom he lodged had notice to quit their house unless he left, and it was with the greatest difficulty he secured a house when he married.&quot;

The first building was completed in 1806, giving way to the present enlarged building in 1906.

The current pastor is the Rev. Joel Schofield.

==Transport==
===Rail===
Eynsford station provides the village with National Rail services to London Blackfriars via Catford and to Sevenoaks.
===Buses===
Eynsford is served by Go-Coach route 2 to Sevenoaks and Swanley, with limited journeys on Mondays through Saturdays.

<doc id="1240921" wikidata="Q6665975" url="?curid=1240921" title="Locomotive frame">
<text>A locomotive frame is the structure that forms the backbone of the railway locomotive, giving it strength and supporting the superstructure elements such as a cab, boiler or bodywork. The vast majority of locomotives have had a frame structure of some kind. The frame may in turn be supported by axles directly attached to it, or it may be mounted on bogies (UK) / trucks (US), or a combination of the two. The bogies in turn will have frames of their own.

==Types of frame==

Three main types of frame on steam locomotives may be distinguished:

===Plate frames===
These used steel plates about thick. They were mainly used in Britain and continental Europe. On most locomotives, the frames would be situated within the driving wheels (&quot;inside frames&quot;), but some classes of an early steam locomotive and diesel shunters were constructed with &quot;outside frames&quot;.
Some early designs were double framed where the frame consisted of plates both inside and outside the driving wheels. Others were &quot;sandwich frames&quot; where the frame was constructed of wood sandwiched between two metal plates.

===Bar frames===

These are openwork girder structures built up from steel or iron bars which are usually thick, welded into a single load-bearing assembly. They were first used on the Bury Bar Frame locomotive during the 1830s, and were widely used in nineteenth century American locomotives (including those exported to Australia and New Zealand; see Vogel railways).

===Cast steel beds===
Cast steel locomotive beds were developed in the latter years of steam locomotive design in the United States, from where they were also exported to Britain and Australia.

== Articulated locomotives ==
An articulated locomotive with no fixed wheels (i.e. excluding the Mallet locomotive but including other articulated steam locomotives, as well as most diesel and electric locomotives) may have a separate frame beneath the superstructure, or the bodywork&#x27;s internal structure may be load-bearing. Rarely is a true monocoque structure used.

Diesel and electric locomotives with a traditional, full-width body, known as cab units in North America, tend to have their strength in an internal structure. This style of construction is still popular elsewhere, but North American locomotives nowadays are overwhelmingly hood units—with a strong frame beneath the superstructure that carries all the load, and bodywork made of removable panels for easy maintenance. Fully enclosed locomotives are used in some limited applications, mostly for passenger trains. These tend to be cowl units, in which the body is not load-bearing.
