<text>Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology Nagpur (VNIT) formally known as Visvesvaraya Regional College of Engineering (VRCE) is a public technical university located in the city of Nagpur, Maharashtra. Established in 1960, the institute is among 31 National Institutes of Technology (NITs) in the country. In 2007, the institute was conferred with the status of Institute of National Importance by the National Institutes of Technology, Science Education and Research Act, 2007 of the Parliament of India with all other NITs.

Formerly known as Visvesvaraya Regional College of Engineering (VRCE), the institute is named in honour of an eminent engineer, planner and statesman Sir M. Visvesvaraya. The Institute awards Bachelor&#x27;s, Master&#x27;s and Doctorate degrees in engineering, technology, architecture, science and humanities.

== History ==
The institute&#x27;s history can be traced back to 1947 when the Architecture Department was established by the Madhya Pradesh Government. Following the second five-year plan (1956–60) in India, several industrial projects were contemplated. The Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs) were established by the central government to mimic the IITs at a regional level and act as benchmarks for the other colleges in that state.

For the Western region in the year 1960, the institute was established under the name Visvesvaraya Regional College of Engineering (VRCE). It was established under the scheme sponsored by Govt. of India and Govt. of Maharashtra. The college was started in June 1960 by amalgamating the State Govt. Engineering College functioning in Nagpur since July 1956. In the meeting held in October 1962, the governing board of the college resolved to name it after the eminent engineer, planner, and statesman of the country M. Visvesvaraya.

The college started functioning in 1960 from a camp office in the premises of Government Polytechnic, Nagpur and subsequently, an area of about 214 acres was acquired to house an independent Regional Engineering College at its present location.

The institute uses relative grading on a 10-point scale.

===Admissions===
Till 2012–13, admission to the undergraduate courses (B.Tech.) at NITs was through the All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE). From 2013 to 2014, admission to the undergraduate courses (B.Tech.) is through the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main. The National Institutes of Technology (NITs) have one of the lowest acceptance rates for engineering institutes, around 2 to 3 percent, second only to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in India.

From 2015, the Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSSA)] conducts common counselling and allocates seats jointly for all Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs). In 2015, over 1,300,000 candidates appeared for the JEE exam for admission to 28,000 undergraduate engineering seats (B.Tech.) in 68 centrally-funded technical institutes that included all 19 IITs (10,000 seats), 31 NITs (15,500 seats) and 18 IIITs (2,500 seats).

Undergraduate admissions for foreign students and NRIs are done through Direct Admission of Students Abroad (DASA) scheme which considers SAT scores.

Eighty percent of students to the postgraduate programs (M.Tech.) are admitted based on performance in the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) conducted by the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). These students receive stipends and tuition assistance from the institute and the Indian government. Another 20% of students are admitted based on industry or other research organization sponsorship, with full tuition typically paid by the sponsoring institution.

The institute invites applications for PhD degree admissions in all departments for two times during summer and winter session .

<doc id="1247952" wikidata="Q12070488" url="?curid=1247952" title="Taco Cabana">
<text>Taco Cabana is an American fast casual restaurant chain that serves Tex-Mex cuisine. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of YTC Enterprises LLC, and headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. Taco Cabana is recognized for its &quot;pink&quot; color scheme and semi-enclosed patio dining areas. Many menu items are handmade daily on-site, in open-display cooking areas.

==History==
===Formation of the restaurant chain===
Taco Cabana was founded by Felix Stehling in September 1978, with its first restaurant at the corner of San Pedro and Hildebrand Avenue in Midtown San Antonio. Stehling purchased a vacant Dairy Queen because the family needed additional parking space for their bar across the street, the Crystal Pistol. Stehling decided to open a taco stand. The open-air design of the existing structure led to the &quot;patio cafe&quot; concept that defined the chain&#x27;s subsequent locations. Felix Stehling&#x27;s wife, Billie Jo Stehling, created the décor and interior theme for the restaurant chain. After finding all of the patio furniture stolen following the first night of business, Stehling decided to keep the place open 24 hours.

The restaurant focused on fresh foods rather than pre-packaged or pre-prepared foods. The restaurant served beer and margaritas, staying open 24/7 and allowing takeout orders. As the business grew, Stehling asked his two brothers to help expand the chain throughout San Antonio. It soon grew to nine restaurants. In 1986 the brothers left the company after differences in opinion on how to manage the business.

In 1990, Taco Cabana began expansion into neighboring states and continued its growth throughout Texas. Richard Cervera became president of the company in 1990, implementing a plan to franchise the brand.

===IPO and imitators===

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the success of Taco Cabana encouraged imitators such as Two Pesos. In January 1987 Taco Cabana filed a suit against Two Pesos for allegedly duplicating Taco Cabana&#x27;s branding style. Two Pesos lost the case and appealed, and in 1992 the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Taco Cabana and awarded the company $3.7 million in damages.

In 1992 Taco Cabana went public with its first stock offering, and ended the year with 17 restaurants. In January 1993 Taco Cabana announced that it was purchasing cash-strapped Two Pesos&#x27; restaurant assets in exchange for 940,000 shares of Taco Cabana stock, valued at approximately $22 million. For $30 million, the sale included all 30 San Antonio restaurants of Two Pesos. Taco Cabana converted most Two Pesos locations into Taco Cabana restaurants, closed others and sold the associated Shortstop Hamburger chain.

Taco Cabana sales hit a high in 1994 at $127 million. That year, Stehling resigned as chairman and was succeeded by Richard Cervera. Despite the rise in revenues the company saw while Cervera was in charge, stock prices for Taco Cabana drastically dropped, and Cervera resigned in 1995 and was replaced by Stephen Clark.

===Business model change and purchase===
In 1995, Cervera resigned as president for a position with the House of Blues, remaining chairman and CEO.

Stephen Clark was appointed both COO and president. Clark began an evaluation of Taco Cabana&#x27;s operations with his own management team. He closed several of the company-owned restaurants, restructured some of the franchisee debt, sold assets not related to restaurants, and slowed the expansion. In 1996, Taco Cabana introduced a new type of restaurant to the Dallas-Fort Worth area which was reminiscent of an old Mexican cafe. It featured a rounded front, clay tile roofing, aged wood paneling, and stainless steel counter tops. As customer visits and profits increased, there were plans to extend the designs to new restaurants.

===Acquisition by Carrols===
By 2000, Taco Cabana spent around $30 million on brand image and while profits had grown, the stock price remained low. Clark began looking at sale options. In 2001 the company became privately held as a wholly owned subsidiary of Carrols Restaurant Group. After the acquisition, Clark left the company and was succeeded by Mike Biviano.

In 2001, it introduced its Mexican grill concept, including made-to-order grilled beef, chicken, pork and shrimp. Throughout 2002, the franchise closed seven stores in the Phoenix, Arizona area, but Taco Cabana proved profitable. In 2003 Taco Cabana began creating a new restaurant prototype with an eight-foot char-grill. That year Taco Cabana opened nine new restaurants. In 2004, it marketed the concept of fresh food and San Antonio heritage. From 2004 through 2005 Taco Cabana added five more restaurants.

The franchise operated 120 restaurants in 2005.

===Fiesta Restaurant Group===

In 2012, Carrols spun off the Taco Cabana brand and its sister brand Pollo Tropical to establish Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc. – a public-traded company of its own. As of October 1, 2012, it operated 160 restaurants. In December 2012, Fiesta announced that would be moving the location of its headquarters to Addison, Texas, with plans to grow substantially over the next 2 years.[10] Later that year, the founder, Felix Stehling, died at the age of 87.[9] In January 2016, Fiesta had 162 company-owned and six franchised Taco Cabana restaurants. In February 2016, there were plans to open up to 10 new Taco Cabana restaurants in Texas, adding to the 164 company-owned stores and 6 franchised ones.[11] In 2017, the store saw some declines in sales in the second quarter, which Fiesta attributed to less marketing. As of July 2017, it had 176 Taco Cabana stores.[12] On January 14, 2020, it was announced that Fiesta Restaurant Group will be closing 19 Texas Taco Cabanas immediately, citing - “eliminate all stores with significant losses&quot;.[13]

===Renovations===
In 2012, Taco Cabana began renovating its restaurants across the system. The new design featured decorative metal &quot;estrella&quot; (star) lights hanging from the ceiling, papel picado accents and large street-life photos from Mexico decorating the walls.

=== Acquisition by Yadav ===
In August 2021, Yadav Enterprises, Inc. finalized a deal to purchase Taco Cabana from Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc. in a deal reportedly worth $85 million. Fiesta cited the reason for the sale is to focus on the Pollo Tropical brand.

==Menu and ordering==
In 2002, it temporarily introduced flautas to the menu, which were then made permanent after they proved popular. In 2003, Taco Cabana introduced the &quot;premium bowl,&quot; a precursor for salads and bowls on the menu. In April 2004, Taco Cabana introduced the Dozen Breakfast Tacos Box, a promotion that proved popular enough to become permanent. During 2006 through 2010, new products were tested, including the Shrimp Tampico and grilled pupusa. Taco Cabana has introduced a number of temporary items since then, some becoming permanent items, with steak street tacos added in December 2010, brisket tacos added in April 2011, sopapillas and flan in June 2011, and shrimp in February 2013.

In 2012, the company&#x27;s chefs were experimenting with street food. In 2015, Taco Cabana began using an online mobile ordering app. In January 2018, the chain began offering certain breakfast foods all day. The chain continues to showcase a variety of alcoholic beverages, including its signature $2 margaritas. In March 2018, the chain brought back Texas smokehouse brisket. It continues to have taco boxes with a dozen tacos of various sorts, with all breakfast tacos available in the mornings and several breakfast tacos available all-day. It sells some of its hot sauces as of 2017.

In mid-March 2020, all of the restaurants abandoned their in-store dine-ins and began take-away service caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. By June, some allowed outdoor dine-ins, and by early 2021, all Taco Cabana dining rooms and patios were open for guests.

===Programs===
Taco Cabana has its own app where guests can find locations and order online for delivery or pick-up. TC also has a loyalty rewards program.

===Charity work===
In Texas, Taco Cabana has been involved with several local military organizations, and the Brand offers a daily 15% discount in-restaurant/drive-thru for those in the military (excluding alcohol and gift card purchases).

<text>One Must Fall (OMF) is a fighting game series for the IBM PC compatible, programmed by Diversions Entertainment.

==&quot;One Must Fall&quot;==

The original &quot;One Must Fall&quot; is a game demo created in the wake of the success of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. It features two human fighters, resembling the Karate Champ characters, who fight in a single arena. Players can kick, punch, throw, create fireballs, teleport, and do a jumpkick. The game was completely retooled for a commercial release, as the original concept was considered too repetitive. This prototype was featured in several collections of shareware and freeware games.

==&quot;One Must Fall: 2097&quot;==
Released in 1994 by Epic MegaGames, &quot;One Must Fall: 2097&quot; replaced the human fighters with robots. In-game competitors were connected to a machine which allowed them direct control of, and shared sensation with, their robot counterparts. Eleven robots and ten customizable pilots were available for play, along with five arenas and four tournaments. The pilots vary in strength, speed and endurance, thus the many robot/pilot combinations allow for larger replay value.

==&quot;One Must Fall: Battlegrounds&quot;==
Developed by Diversions Entertainment and co-published in December 2003 by Diversions Publishing and Trisynergy Inc. following nearly seven years of development, &quot;One Must Fall: Battlegrounds&quot; brought the &quot;One Must Fall&quot; series into a second installment released in an age where the gaming world expected graphics and gameplay in three dimensions with internet gameplay as integral portion of the offering.

<text>Gelsemiaceae is a family of flowering plants, belonging to the order Gentianales. The family contains only three genera: &quot;Gelsemium&quot;, &quot;Mostuea&quot; and &quot;Pteleocarpa&quot;. &quot;Gelsemium&quot; has three species, one native to Southeast Asia and southern China and two native to Central America, Mexico, and the southeastern United States. The eight species of &quot;Mostuea&quot; are native to tropical areas of South America, Africa, and Madagascar. The two genera were formerly classified in the family Loganiaceae.
&quot;Pteleocarpa&quot; was originally placed in Boraginaceae or in its own family Pteleocarpaceae, but it is most closely related to Gelsemiaceae with which it shares significant characters.

The family Gelsemiaceae was described in 1994. It is distinguished by having no latex or stipules and by having heterostylous flowers with yellow to white corollas and superior ovaries.

In 2014, a molecular phylogenetic study of the lamiids (aka Garryidae) resolved the anomalous genus &quot;Pteleocarpa&quot; as sister to (other) Gelsemiaceae. The authors of that study believe that Gelsemiaceae should be expanded to include &quot;Pteleocarpa&quot;. The APG IV system published in 2016 includes &quot;Pteleocarpa&quot; in Gelsemiaceae.

<doc id="1247969" wikidata="Q362639" url="?curid=1247969" title="Ferdinand Hérold">
<text>Louis Joseph Ferdinand Herold (28 January 1791 – 19 January 1833), better known as Ferdinand Hérold (), was a French composer. He was celebrated in his lifetime for his operas, of which he composed more than twenty, but he also wrote ballet music, works for piano and choral pieces. He is best known today for the ballet &quot;La Fille mal gardée&quot; and the overture to the opera &quot;Zampa&quot;.

Born in Paris to a musical family, Hérold trained at the Paris Conservatoire and won France&#x27;s premier musical prize, the Prix de Rome in 1812. After a time in Italy he returned to Paris and worked first at the Théâtre Italien and then at the Opéra. He wrote several ballets for the latter, but was best known as a composer of &quot;opéra comique&quot;. Some of them, particularly in his early days, were hampered by poor librettos, but later he had more successes than failures, and his last two operas, &quot;Zampa&quot; (1831) and &quot;Le Pré aux clercs&quot; (The Clerk&#x27;s Meadow, 1832) were immensely popular, and remained in the repertory in France and elsewhere for decades after his early death from tuberculosis in 1833.

As a ballet composer Hérold was a pioneer, raising the standard of ballet scores from being simple arrangements of popular tunes to well-orchestrated music illustrating the action of the ballets. His operas influenced later composers from Bizet and Offenbach to Wagner and Smetana.

==Life and career==

===Background and early years===

The Herold family was of Alsatian origin (the surname was written without an acute accent). The composer&#x27;s father, François-Joseph Herold (1755–1802) was the son of an organist in Seltz. François-Joseph studied music with C. P. E. Bach in Hamburg and moved to Paris in about 1780, where he worked as a composer, pianist and teacher. In 1790 he married Jeanne-Gabrielle Pascal. Their only child, Louis Joseph Ferdinand Herold, later widely known as Ferdinand Hérold, was born in what is now the rue Herold in the 1st arrondissement on 28 January 1791. Wanting the boy to have an all-round education, François-Joseph sent him, aged eleven, to one of the best boarding schools in Paris, the Hix institute in the Champs-Élysées. The school included music in the curriculum, and Hérold studied solfège with François-Joseph Fétis. At the same time he continued his piano studies with his godfather, Louis Adam.

François-Joseph did not intend his son to follow him into the musical profession, but his death, from tuberculosis, in 1802 left Hérold free to do so. In 1806, when he was nearly 16, he entered the Paris Conservatoire, where he studied piano with Adam, harmony with Charles-Simon Catel and violin with Rodolphe Kreutzer. In 1810 he won the conservatoire&#x27;s first prize for piano, playing one of his own compositions. In 1811 he was admitted to the composition class of Étienne Méhul, who esteemed his talents greatly, saw him as his successor, and became a much-loved father-figure to him. During 1812 works by Hérold were performed publicly for the first time. They included a piano concerto given on 6 April at the Théâtre Italien with the composer as soloist.

In October 1812 Hérold was awarded France&#x27;s premier musical prize, the Prix de Rome, which he won with a cantata, &quot;La Duchesse de la Vallière&quot;. The prize carried with it liberally subsidised residence and tuition at the Villa Medici, the French Academy in Rome, where Hérold went in 1813. There, he composed his first symphony and an anthem. Like his father, Hérold suffered from tuberculosis, and the climate of Rome did not suit him; he moved south to Naples in 1815.

In Naples, Hérold won the approval of Joachim Murat, whom Napoleon had installed as King of Naples. Hérold was engaged as court pianist to Murat&#x27;s wife, Queen Caroline, and music teacher to their daughters. While in Naples, Hérold was commissioned in 1814 to write his first opera, &quot;La gioventù di Enrico quinto&quot; (The Boyhood of Henry V), to a libretto from Alexandre Pineux-Duval&#x27;s play &quot;La jeunesse de Henry V&quot; about Prince Hal of England. It was premiered in January 1815 at the Teatro del Fondo before Murat&#x27;s court, with Manuel García in the title role. Shortly after this, the Napoleonic empire began to disintegrate, and Hérold left Naples, making a circuitous journey back to Paris. He went via Rome and Venice to Vienna, where he met Antonio Salieri, whom he admired, and heard operas by Mozart.

===Return to Paris===

Hérold arrived back in Paris in August 1815, where he took the post of &quot;maestro al cembalo&quot; (deputy conductor and &quot;répétiteur&quot;) at the Théâtre Italien. In 1816 the composer François-Adrien Boieldieu invited him to collaborate on a new opera &quot;Charles de France&quot;, to which Hérold contributed the second act. In the same year he composed the opera &quot;Les Rosières&quot;, dedicated to Méhul, produced successfully at the Opéra-Comique. He had another success with &quot;La Clochette&quot; (The Bell, 1817), based on the story of Aladdin and his lamp; it ran well in Paris and was seen in Vienna (with additional numbers by Franz Schubert) After these, he had difficulty finding adequate librettos, and suffered four failures in a row between 1818 and 1821, following which he gave up composing operas for more than two years.

In 1821 the director of the Théâtre Italien asked Hérold to go to Italy to find new works and recruit new singers. Across a four-month trip he visited seven major Italian cities and attended performances of Rossini operas including &quot;La donna del lago&quot;, which made a strong impression on him, &quot;La gazza ladra&quot; and &quot;Ricciardo e Zoraide&quot;. He recruited singers including Giuditta Pasta, Filippo Galli for his Parisian employer.

During 1823 Hérold had another opera produced, &quot;Le Muletier&quot;; despite an unimpressive libretto the music was well received. The biographer Thomas Betzwieser writes that in &quot;Le Muletier&quot; Hérold &quot;found his own language for the first time&quot; so that this work marks the emergence of his personal style. A one-act piece for the Paris Opéra, &quot;L&#x27;Asthénie&quot;, had a moderate run but was not well reviewed, and it was not until 1826 that he had another success, with &quot;Marie&quot; at the Opéra-Comique.

In November 1826 Hérold gave up his post at the Théâtre Italien and became &quot;premier chef de chant&quot; (senior voice coach) at the Opéra, working on major works in the grand opéra genre such as &quot;Le Siège de Corinthe&quot;, &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;, and &quot;Robert le diable&quot;. His position as &quot;chef de chant&quot; meant that he was barred from having his own operas performed at the Opéra, and his principal commissions there over the next three years were for ballet music: &quot;Astolphe et Jaconde&quot; (1827), &quot;La Somnambule&quot; (The Sleepwalker) (1827), &quot;La Fille mal gardée&quot; (1828) &quot;Lydie&quot; (1828), &quot;La Belle au bois dormant&quot; (The Sleeping Beauty) (1829) and &quot;La Noce de village&quot; (Village Wedding) (1830).

Hérold married Adèle Elise Rollet in 1827. They had three children: Ferdinand, who became a lawyer and subsequently a senator; Adèle, who married a member of the Paris Conseil municipal; and Eugénie, a gifted musician, who, like her father and grandfather was consumptive, and died aged 20.

===Final years===

Betzwieser writes that the composer&#x27;s last three years were dominated by the writing of &quot;his two masterpieces&quot;: &quot;Zampa&quot; (1831) and &quot;Le Pré aux clercs&quot; (1832). The first had a romantic libretto by Mélesville that appealed to the public and brought out the best in Hérold. The work had a tentative start because of a financial crisis at Opéra-Comique and the defection of the company&#x27;s leading tenor, but it quickly became one of the most popular opéras comiques of the 19th century, in France and elsewhere, being staged in the US and Britain in 1833.

In mid-1832 the Opéra-Comique had to close because of a cholera outbreak and civil disorder. During this period Hérold finished &quot;Le Pré aux clercs&quot;, to a libretto by Eugène de Planard based on Prosper Mérimée&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Les Chroniques du temps de Charles IX&quot; (1829). Betzwieser writes that it aroused wild enthusiasm at its premiere on 15 December 1832.

By the time of the first performance of &quot;Le Pré aux clercs&quot; in December 1832 the composer&#x27;s tubercular condition had grown worse. His strength was taxed by the need to rehearse a new leading lady at short notice when the soprano cast for the role withdrew after her demand for higher fees was refused. Five weeks after the premiere he died, nine days short of 42, at his house in Paris, and was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery.

Hérold left an unfinished opera, &quot;Ludovic&quot;. His friend Fromental Halévy completed the score, and it was performed three months after Hérold&#x27;s death. By the end of the 19th century &quot;Le Pré aux clercs&quot; had been performed more than 1,500 times in Paris.

==Music==
The musicologist Gustav Choquet wrote in 1904 that Hérold&#x27;s early symphonic, choral and chamber works show that the composer could have excelled in concert works had he continued in that type of composition, but the stage &quot;possesses an irresistible attraction for a man gifted with ardent imagination and capacity for expressing emotion&quot;, leading Hérold to opera and the ballet.

===Ballets===

Until Hérold&#x27;s day the role of the composer was not a prestigious one in the world of ballet. In &quot;The International Encyclopedia of Dance&quot;, Ole Nørlyng observes that ballet scores before then &quot;seldom rose above light arrangements of well-known melodies and dance tunes&quot;. Hérold, and his friend Adolphe Adam (son of his godfather and piano teacher), made the first steps to elevating ballet scores to a higher musical level. Hérold continued the practice of using familiar operatic tunes (partly to aid audiences&#x27; comprehension of mime scenes), but he borrowed carefully and with discrimination. &quot;La Belle au bois dormant&quot; is an early example, using music from, &quot;inter alia&quot;, Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; and showing, (&quot;if in a crude form&quot;, in Nørlyng&#x27;s phrase) the first steps towards more dramatically penetrating ballet music.

Nørlyng adds that in addition, Hérold &quot;had a never-failing elegance of orchestration, a melodic richness, and the ability to create dramatic effects&quot;. Nonetheless, Hérold did not treat the role of ballet composer with the attention he gave to his operas: he was known to compose his ballets at the dinner table while talking to friends. When they objected to his spending his talents on such trivial work he replied, &quot;Plus j&#x27;écris, plus les idées me viennent&quot; (&quot;The more I write, the more ideas come to me&quot;).

Although Hérold&#x27;s name is associated in the public mind with the music for &quot;La Fille mal gardée&quot;, the score he wrote for the Opéra in 1828 differs substantially from that played in modern productions of the ballet. His score is known to have incorporated some music from an earlier production of the ballet, as well as other contemporary sources, notably Rossini. Later productions have added music by Peter Ludwig Hertel, and the most famous number in the piece, the clog dance, is a modern invention, based on one of Hertel&#x27;s tunes, by John Lanchbery, who revised the whole score in 1959 for Frederick Ashton&#x27;s production. Lanchbery maintained that the orchestration of Hérold&#x27;s score is inferior to that of his operas, probably because it was hurriedly composed.

Eugène Scribe&#x27;s libretto for &quot;La Somnambule&quot; (which inspired Bellini&#x27;s opera &quot;La sonnambula&quot;) led Hérold to produce what Nørlyng describes as a graceful, pastoral score, in which, innovatively, Hérold sought to connect the music to the drama through the use of melodic motifs.

===Operas===
Betzwieser comments that despite many deficiencies in the librettos of his early operas, Herold&#x27;s talent for music drama was clear from the outset, and that he advanced the genre of opéra comique with his colourful and varied orchestration, and his gift for smooth transition between the spoken and sung sections of his works. In a 1904 survey of Hérold&#x27;s work, Choquet praised &quot;La Clochette&quot; for its abundance of new and fresh ideas, its stagecraft and original instrumentation. He added that although its immediate successors showed the composer&#x27;s industry and fertility, operas like &quot;Le premier venu&quot; (1818), &quot;Les Troqueurs&quot; (1819), &quot;L&#x27; Amour platonique&quot; (1819), and &quot;L&#x27;Auteur mort et vivant&quot; (1820) had &quot;librettos that were neither interesting nor adapted for music&quot; . &quot;Le Muletier&quot; (1823), however, is &quot;full of life and colour, and assured his reputation&quot;. Choquet adds that after the success of the lively &quot;Le Muletier&quot; it is puzzling that a man of Hérold&#x27;s literary tastes and culture should have chosen to set dramas &quot;so tame and uninteresting as &quot;L&#x27;asthenie&quot; (1823), and &quot;Le Lapin blanc&quot; (1825)&quot;: he concludes that Hérold&#x27;s urge to compose led him to accept any libretto offered to him.

By the time of the comedy &quot;Marie&quot; (1826) Hérold was incorporating elements of both Rossini&#x27;s and Beethoven&#x27;s musical language. In Betzwieser&#x27;s view &quot;Marie&quot; represents &quot;a crucial turning point in Herold&#x27;s writing&quot;, and the poet Gérard de Nerval described the work as the &quot;golden link&quot; between Hérold&#x27;s early operas and the later masterpieces &quot;Zampa&quot; and &quot;Le Pré aux clercs&quot;.

For &quot;Zampa&quot;, a variant of the Don Juan story – with a female statue rather than a male one bringing nemesis to the antihero – Hérold wrote an overture that contains five different themes related to the action and score of the opera. In the three acts of &quot;Zampa&quot; Hérold, in Betzwieser&#x27;s view, shows particular skill in differentiating between the traditional numbers of &quot;opéra comique&quot;, &quot;from the solo numbers (ballade, barcarole, chanson etc.), used to illustrate the various characters, to the large-scale finales, notable for their skilful variation and the building of a dramatic climax&quot;. Berlioz found things to praise in &quot;Zampa&quot; but thought Hérold lacked a style of his own, yet was neither Italian, nor French, nor German: &quot;His music strongly resembles those industrial products made in Paris according to processes invented elsewhere and slightly modified; it is Parisian music&quot;, which, Berlioz thought, was why the Parisian middle classes loved it. But Betzwieser observes that &quot;Zampa&quot;&#x27;s Romantic features made it highly successful outside France, and writing in &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; the British critic Elizabeth Forbes commented in 1992, &quot;All the music is perfectly suited to its subject, while the portions devoted to Zampa and the statue are highly dramatic as well as melodious&quot;.

Forbes writes that &quot;Le Pré aux clercs&quot; is acknowledged by composers and musicians as one of the finest of its period. The story covers similar ground to Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, but in an intimate, more personal way. Forbes finds the score &quot;a chain of fine numbers, extremely melodious and pretty, but also dramatically well suited to the various characters&quot;, with a balance between comedy and romance. In a 2016 analysis of the score, Gérard Condé writes, &quot;Though doubtless derivative in certain respects, the score of &quot;Le Pré aux clercs&quot; went on to serve as a recipe book for the next half-century: Lecocq, Offenbach, Varney, Audran and even Bizet consulted it with profit, each to his own ends&quot;. In the overture Hérold does not use themes from the opera, but ranges from an opening fugue to a quick march. Wagner and Smetana both knew the opera well, and in another 2016 analysis, Damien Colas writes that echoes of &quot;Le Pré aux clercs&quot; may be found in the former&#x27;s &quot;Das Liebesverbot&quot; (1836) and the latter&#x27;s &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; (1866). In &quot;The Oxford Companion to Music&quot; (2011) Sarah Hibberd writes, &quot;the power of &quot;Le Pré aux clercs&quot; in particular suggests that [Hérold] might have fulfilled his ambition to compose a grand opéra had he lived&quot;.

<text>Open Range is a 2003 American revisionist Western film directed and co-produced by Kevin Costner, written by Craig Storper, based on the novel &quot;The Open Range Men&quot; by Lauran Paine, starring Robert Duvall and Costner, with Annette Bening, Michael Gambon, and Michael Jeter appearing in supporting roles. It presents a range war that follows when free-grazing herder &quot;Boss&quot; Spearman (Duvall) and his cowboys enter the Montana territory of cattle baron Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon).

The film was the final on-screen appearance of Jeter, who died before it was released, and the film was dedicated to Jeter&#x27;s memory, as well as to Costner&#x27;s parents, Bill and Sharon. It was a box-office success and was critically praised.

==Plot==
In Montana in 1882, &quot;Boss&quot; Spearman is a seasoned open range cattleman, who, with hired hands Charley Waite, Mose, and Button, is driving a herd cross-country. Charley is a former Union soldier who served in a &quot;special squad&quot; during the Civil War and feels immense guilt over his past as a killer of both enemy soldiers and civilians.

Boss sends Mose to the nearby town of Harmonville for supplies. The town is controlled by ruthless Irish immigrant and rancher Denton Baxter, who hates open-rangers for using his land to feed their herds. Mose is badly beaten and jailed by the town&#x27;s corrupt marshal, Poole, after defending himself in a fight with some of Baxter&#x27;s men. The only Harmonville inhabitant willing to openly defy Baxter is Percy, the livery stable owner.

Boss and Charley become concerned when Mose does not return. They retrieve him from the jail, but not before Baxter gives them an ultimatum to leave the area before nightfall. Mose&#x27;s injuries are so severe that Boss and Charley take him to the local physician, Doc Barlow. There, they meet his assistant, Sue. Charley is attracted immediately, but assumes that Sue is the doctor&#x27;s wife and chooses not to stay the night, even after being invited.

After catching masked riders scouting their cattle, Boss and Charley sneak up on their campsite, and disarm and humiliate them. At the same time, other riders trash their camp and shoot Mose, and Charley&#x27;s dog Tig, dead. Button is badly injured after being shot in the chest. Charley and Boss vow to avenge their friend. They leave Button at the doctor&#x27;s house and go into town; with help from Percy, they capture Poole and his deputies, subdue them with chloroform stolen from the Barlows, and lock them up in their own jail.

Charley learns that Sue is the doctor&#x27;s sister, not his wife. He declares his feelings for her, and she gives him a locket for luck. Charley leaves a note with Percy, in which he states that if he should die, money from the sale of his saddle and gear are to be used to buy Sue a new tea set, having accidentally destroyed her previous set while suffering a flashback to his war days.

Boss and Charley are pitted against Baxter and his men. Before the fight begins, as the two indulge in candy bars and cigars, Charley confesses to Boss that his full name is Charles Postlewaite, and he asks Boss to reciprocate. Boss says his real name is Bluebonnet Spearman, but makes Charley swear not to tell anyone. As Baxter and his men approach, Charley confronts them and shoots Butler, the hired gunman who killed Mose. An intense gun battle erupts in the street, with Boss, Charley, and Percy outnumbered before the townspeople begin to openly fight against Baxter. Baxter&#x27;s men, Poole and his deputies, and the local saloonkeeper are killed off one-by-one, and Baxter ends up wounded and alone, trapped in the jailhouse. Boss shoots open the jailhouse door and engages him in a brief close-quarters gunfight, which leaves Baxter mortally wounded.

Sue&#x27;s brother tends to the wounded townspeople while the dead are buried, and the town is cleaned up. Charley speaks to Sue in private, telling her he must leave. She counters that she has a &quot;big idea&quot; about their future together and that she will wait for him to return. He does return, and proposes to Sue, who accepts. After Button has recovered, Charley and Boss decide to retire from the cattle business after delivering their current herd and settle down in Harmonville, taking over the saloon.

==Production==
===Inspiration===
Kevin Costner grew up reading the Western romance novels of Lauran Paine, and &quot;Open Range&quot; is based on Paine&#x27;s 1990 novel &quot;The Open Range Men&quot;. Screenwriter Craig Storper wanted to make a movie about &quot;the evolution of violence in the West.&quot; Storper continues: &quot;These characters don&#x27;t seek violence... But the notion that it&#x27;s sometimes necessary... is the Western&#x27;s most fundamental ideal.&quot;

===Casting===
Robert Duvall was the only actor whom Costner had in mind for the role of Boss Spearman. Costner said that if Duvall had turned down the part, he might not have made the movie at all. Duvall accepted the role immediately, and Costner gave him top billing. Duvall got bucked off a horse and broke six ribs while practicing his riding for this role.

On the audio commentary for the DVD of the movie, Costner remarked that he cast Abraham Benrubi as his way of apologizing for his being cut from Costner&#x27;s previous movie, &quot;The Postman.&quot;

===Filming===
Cinematographer J. Michael Muro, was hand-picked by director Kevin Costner for his work on &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;.

The movie was filmed on location on the Stoney Indian Reserve in Alberta, Canada. Clayton Lefthand of the Stoney Sioux First Nations worked as a film liaison.

Filming took place from June 17, 2002, to September 8, 2002. Production spent over $1 million to build a town from scratch because Costner did n0t like any of the existing ones. The town was designed by production designer, Gae S. Buckley, and built in 7 weeks. The location was so far from civilization that $40,000 were spent to build a road to get there before construction could start. Professional cowboys handled 225 head of cattle on the set.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Open Range&quot; was a success at the box office, making $14 million in its opening weekend in the U.S. across 2,075 screens. Against a budget of $22 million, it finished its theatrical run with $58.3 million in North America and $10 million from foreign markets for a total of $68.3 million worldwide.

===Critical reception===
The film received mostly positive reviews, receiving a 79% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 184 reviews, with an average rating of 6.80/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Greatly benefiting from the tremendous chemistry between Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall, &quot;Open Range&quot; is a sturdy modern Western with classic roots.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave it three and a half out of four stars, calling it &quot;an imperfect but deeply involving and beautifully made Western&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film four out of five stars, writing, &quot;Duvall gives his best performance in ages&quot; in a &quot;tough, muscular, satisfying movie&quot;.

In particular, the gun fighting scenes were intentionally filmed in giant, wide shots and were praised for their intense realism by a number of critics, yet were the reason the film earned an R rating. Kevin Carr of FilmThreat.com said on the gun action in &quot;Open Range&quot;: &quot;After &quot;The Matrix&quot; redefined action in the late 1990s, every crummy action sequence tries to repeat the power of &#x27;bullet time&#x27; often with little success. The action in &quot;Open Range&quot; is filmed real time, grabbing the audience and showing them that when this kind of stuff happens in real life, it happens faster than you think it would.&quot; A review on Moviola stated that the film has &quot;one of the most exciting final gunfights ever filmed&quot;. IGN, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Total Film&quot;, and &quot;Guns &amp; Ammo&quot; all also say the shootout scene is one of the best of all time.

===Awards===
The film won the 2004 Western Heritage Award, and was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award, an MTV Movie Award (Diego Luna), a Motion Picture Sound Editors Award, and a Taurus Award for stunt artist Chad Camilleri. It was number 48 in &quot;TimeOut London&quot;&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest Westerns&quot; list.

<text>The was a world&#x27;s fair held in what is now part of the Minami Ward of Nagoya city, Japan from 15 March to 31 May in 1937.

==History==
Sponsored by the Japanese government and with HIH Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko as chairman, the Nagoya Pan-Pacific Peace Exposition was intended to promote industry, transportation, education, science, construction, architecture, social welfare, tourism, fine arts and crafts. Each of the participating nations or colonies had its own pavilion to promote its products and culture, and each of the prefectures of Japan (with the exception of Tottori and the external territories of Taiwan, Karafuto and Korea) also had a pavilion. In addition, major Japanese industries also sponsored their own pavilions.

Over the two and a half months of operation, the Nagoya Exhibition received more than 4,800,000 visitors, or roughly four times the population of the greater Nagoya area at the time. Daily attendance averaged at 61,643 people.

<doc id="1247989" wikidata="Q285050" url="?curid=1247989" title="Tunnel ionization">
<text>In physics, tunnel ionization is a process in which electrons in an atom (or a molecule) tunnel through the potential barrier and escape from the atom (or molecule). In an intense electric field, the potential barrier of an atom (molecule) is distorted drastically. Therefore, as the length of the barrier that electrons have to pass decreases, the electrons can escape from the atom&#x27;s potential more easily. Tunneling ionization is a quantum mechanical phenomenon since in the classical picture an electron does not have sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier of the atom.

When the atom is in a DC external field, the Coulomb potential barrier is lowered and the electron has an increased, non-zero probability of tunnelling through the potential barrier. In the case of an alternating electric field, the direction of the electric field reverses after the half period of the field. The ionized electron may come back to its parent ion. The electron may recombine with the nucleus (nuclei) and its kinetic energy is released as light (high harmonic generation). If the recombination does not occur, further ionization may proceed by collision between high-energy electrons and a parent atom (molecule). This process is known as non-sequential ionization.

== DC tunneling ionization ==
Tunneling ionization from the ground state of a hydrogen atom in an electrostatic (DC) field was solved schematically by Lev Landau, using parabolic coordinates. This provides a simplified physical system that given it proper exponential dependence of the ionization rate on the applied external field. When , the ionization rate for this system is given by:
: formula_1

Landau expressed this in atomic units, where . In SI units the previous parameters can be expressed as:
: formula_2,
: formula_3.

The ionization rate is the total probability current through the outer classical turning point. This rate is found using the WKB approximation to match the ground state hydrogen wavefunction through the suppressed coulomb potential barrier.

A more physically meaningful form for the ionization rate above can be obtained by noting that the Bohr radius and hydrogen atom ionization energy are given by
: formula_4,
: formula_5,
where formula_6 is the Rydberg energy. Then, the parameters formula_7 and formula_8 can be written as
: formula_9, formula_10.
so that the total ionization rate can be rewritten
: formula_11.

This form for the ionization rate formula_12 emphasizes that the characteristic electric field needed for ionization formula_13 is proportional to the ratio of the ionization energy formula_14 to the characteristic size of the electron&#x27;s orbital . Thus, atoms with low ionization energy (such as alkali metals) with electrons occupying orbitals with high principal quantum number formula_15 (i.e. far down the periodic table) ionize most easily under a DC field. Furthermore, for a hydrogenic atom, the scaling of this characteristic ionization field goes as , where formula_16 is the nuclear charge. This scaling arises because the ionization energy scales as formula_17 and the orbital radius as . More accurate and general formulas for the tunneling from Hydrogen orbitals can also be obtained.

As an empirical point of reference, the characteristic electric field formula_7 for the ordinary hydrogen atom is about (or ) and the characteristic frequency formula_19 is .

== AC electric field ==
The ionization rate of a hydrogen atom in an alternating electric field, like that of a laser, can be treated, in the appropriate limit, as the DC ionization rate averaged over a single period of the electric field&#x27;s oscillation. Multiphoton and tunnel ionization of an atom or a molecule describes the same process by which a bounded electron, through the absorption of more than one photon from the laser field, is ionized. The difference between them is a matter of definition under different conditions. They can henceforth be called multiphoton ionization (MPI) whenever the distinction is not necessary. The dynamics of the MPI can be described by finding the time evolution of the state of the atom which is described by the Schrödinger equation.

When the intensity of the laser is strong, the &quot;lowest-order perturbation theory&quot; is not sufficient to describe the MPI process. In this case, the laser field on larger distances from the nucleus is more important than the Coulomb potential and the dynamic of the electron in the field should be properly taken into account. The first work in this category was published by Leonid Keldysh. He modeled the MPI process as a transition of the electron from the ground state of the atom to the Volkov states (the state of a free electron in the electromagnetic field). In this model, the perturbation of the ground state by the laser field is neglected and the details of atomic structure in determining the ionization probability are not taken into account. The major difficulty with Keldysh&#x27;s model was its neglect of the effects of Coulomb interaction on the final state of the electron. As is observed from the figure, the Coulomb field is not very small in magnitude compared to the potential of the laser at larger distances from the nucleus. This is in contrast to the approximation made by neglecting the potential of the laser at regions near the nucleus. A. M. Perelomov, V. S. Popov and M. V. Terent&#x27;ev included the Coulomb interaction at larger internuclear distances. Their model (which is called the PPT model after their initials) was derived for short-range potential and includes the effect of the long-range Coulomb interaction through the first-order correction in the quasi-classical action. In the quasi-static limit, the PPT model approaches the ADK model by M. V. Ammosov, N. B. Delone, and V. P. Krainov.

Many experiments have been carried out on the MPI of rare gas atoms using strong laser pulses, through measuring both the total ion yield and the kinetic energy of the electrons. Here, one only considers the experiments designed to measure the total ion yield. Among these experiments are those by S. L. Chin et al., S. Augst et al. and T. Auguste et al. Chin et al. used a 10.6 μm CO2 laser in their experiment. Due to the very small frequency of the laser, the tunneling is strictly quasi-static, a characteristic that is not easily attainable using pulses in the near infrared or visible region of frequencies. These findings weakened the suspicion on the applicability of models basically founded on the assumption of a structureless atom. S. Larochelle et al. have compared the theoretically predicted ion versus intensity curves of rare gas atoms interacting with a :Ti:sapphire laser with experimental measurement. They have shown that the total ionization rate predicted by the PPT model fits very well the experimental ion yields for all rare gases in the intermediate regime of Keldysh parameter.

=== Analytical formula for the rate of MPI ===
The dynamics of the MPI can be described by finding the time evolution of the state of the atom which is described by the Schrödinger equation. The form of this equation in the electric field gauge, assuming the single active electron (SAE) approximation and using dipole approximation, is the following
: formula_20 
where formula_21 is the electric field of the laser and formula_22 is the static Coulomb potential of the atomic core at the position of the active electron. By finding the exact solution of equation (1) for a potential formula_23 ( the magnitude of the ionization potential of the atom), the probability current formula_24 is calculated. Then, the total MPI rate from short-range potential for linear polarization, , is found from
: formula_25
where formula_26 is the frequency of the laser, which is assumed to be polarized in the direction of the formula_27 axis. The effect of the ionic potential, which behaves like formula_28 (formula_16 is the charge of atomic or ionic core) at a long distance from the nucleus, is calculated through first order correction on the semi-classical action. The result is that the effect of ionic potential is to increase the rate of MPI by a factor of
: formula_30
Where formula_31 and formula_32 is the peak electric field of laser. Thus, the total rate of MPI from a state with quantum numbers formula_33 and formula_34 in a laser field for linear polarization is calculated to be
: formula_35
: formula_36
: formula_37 
The coefficient formula_38 is given by
: formula_39,
where
: formula_40
: formula_41
: formula_42
The ADK model is the limit of the PPT model when formula_43 approaches zero (quasi-static limit). In this case, which is known as quasi-static tunnelling (QST), the ionization rate is given by
: formula_44.
In practice, the limit for the QST regime is . This is justified by the following consideration. Referring to the figure, the ease or difficulty of tunneling can be expressed as the ratio between the equivalent classical time it takes for the electron to tunnel out the potential barrier while the potential is bent down. This ratio is indeed , since the potential is bent down during half a cycle of the field oscillation and the ratio can be expressed as 
: formula_45,
where formula_46 is the tunneling time (classical time of flight of an electron through a potential barrier, and formula_47 is the period of laser field oscillation.

=== MPI of molecules ===
Contrary to the abundance of theoretical and experimental work on the MPI of rare gas atoms, the amount of research on the prediction of the rate of MPI of neutral molecules was scarce until recently. Walsh et al. have measured the MPI rate of some diatomic molecules interacting with a CO2 laser. They found that these molecules are tunnel-ionized as if they were structureless atoms with an ionization potential equivalent to that of the molecular ground state. A. Talebpour et al. were able to quantitatively fit the ionization yield of diatomic molecules interacting with a Ti:sapphire laser pulse. The conclusion of the work was that the MPI rate of a diatomic molecule can be predicted from the PPT model by assuming that the electron tunnels through a barrier given by formula_48 instead of barrier formula_49 which is used in the calculation of the MPI rate of atoms. The importance of this finding is in its practicality; the only parameter needed for predicting the MPI rate of a diatomic molecule is a single parameter, . Using the semi-empirical model for the MPI rate of unsaturated hydrocarbons is feasible. This simplistic view ignores the ionization dependence on orientation of molecular axis with respect to polarization of the electric field of the laser, which is determined by the symmetries of the molecular orbitals. This dependence can be used to follow molecular dynamics using strong field multiphoton ionization.

== Tunneling time ==
The question of how long a tunneling particle spends inside the barrier region has remained unresolved since the early days of quantum mechanics. It is sometimes suggested that the tunneling time is instantaneous because both the Keldysh and the closely related Buttiker-Landauer times are imaginary (corresponding to the decay of the wavefunction under the barrier). In a recent publication the main competing theories of tunneling time are compared against experimental measurements using the attoclock in strong laser field ionization of helium atoms. Refined attoclock measurements reveal a real and not instantaneous tunneling delay time over a large intensity regime. It is found that the experimental results are compatible with the probability distribution of tunneling times constructed using a Feynman path integral (FPI) formulation. However, later work in atomic hydrogen has demonstrated that most of the tunneling time measured in the experiment is purely from the long-range Coulomb force exerted by the ion core on the outgoing electron.

<text>Randall Jerome Gay Jr. (born May 5, 1982) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the LSU Tigers. He was signed by the New England Patriots as an undrafted free agent in 2004.

Gay also played for the New Orleans Saints. He played on a Super Bowl winning team with both the Patriots and the Saints, and is also noted for being one of the two Louisianan-born (other being former LSU and Saints teammate, Devery Henderson) having won a championship at both the college and pro level for teams of Louisiana, his home state.

==Early life==
At Brusly High School in Brusly, Louisiana, Randall Gay was a four-year letterman in football. He also lettered in weight lifting (three years) and track (one year). He was a first-team All-Metro selection, and a first-team All-District selection in football during his last two years of high school. As a senior, in only eight games, he rushed for 1,067 yards and 13 touchdowns, caught three touchdown passes, and returned two punts for touchdowns.

==College career==
He played college football at Louisiana State University. He won a BCS National Championship with the Tigers in 2003 as a nickel back.

==Professional career==

===New England Patriots===
On April 29, 2004, he was signed by the Patriots shortly after the NFL draft as an undrafted free agent. His rookie year, Gay beat out cornerback Christian Morton, the Patriots&#x27; 7th-round draft pick, for a place on the roster. Later in the season, Gay was placed into the starting lineup because of injuries to veterans Ty Law and Tyrone Poole. Gay&#x27;s rookie season concluded with a victory in Super Bowl XXXIX, in which he started opposite Asante Samuel where he was the leading tackler with 11 solo tackles. Gay was involved in several low level controversies as a Patriot: He failed to make a full contribution in 2005 and 2006, due to injuries that landed him on injured reserve. This led to some long running criticisms from the tough vocal New England fans and repeated questions about him on the region&#x27;s talk shows and in the papers. Hence, after failing to deliver up to expectations of New England Patriots fans in both the 2005 and 2006 seasons, before the 2007 training camp, Gay was quoted as saying:

Gay returned in 2007 and played primarily as a nickel back and a backup safety. He did start several games, including the AFC Divisional Game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Gay intercepted a career-high three passes while playing in every game of the 2007 season en route to a perfect regular season that ended with the Patriots&#x27; defeat at the hands of the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII.

===New Orleans Saints===
On March 2, 2008, Gay signed a four-year, $17.8 million contract with the New Orleans Saints. The deal included a $3.75 million signing bonus and $6.9 million in guaranteed money. He was a member of the Saints&#x27; 2009 Super Bowl XLIV Championship team. Gay suffered a concussion early in the 2010 season that eventually led to him being placed on injured reserve on October 20, 2010.

Gay was released by New Orleans on July 28, 2011, and retired thereafter. In 2012, he was a named plaintiff in one of the lawsuits filed by former players against the NFL regarding the league&#x27;s history of players suffering concussions.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Playoffs===
==Personal life==
* Gay majored in marketing at LSU.
* Gay played both cornerback and safety, as he did against the Indianapolis Colts in 2005.
* After Super Bowl XXXIX, one of Gay&#x27;s college professors attempted to order a replica jersey of her former student. The NFL Shop denied her request because the word &quot;Gay&quot; was on a blacklist of words considered related to drugs, sex, or gangs. After the incident was reported in the press, &quot;Gay&quot; was removed from the banned name list because it is the actual name of an NFL player.
* Randall and his wife, Desha, have two sons. After Gay&#x27;s retirement, he and Desha decided to go to law school together. In 2015, they both graduated from Southern University Law Center in Baton Rouge.

<doc id="1248005" wikidata="Q904222" url="?curid=1248005" title="Strychnos">
<text>Strychnos is a genus of flowering plants, belonging to the family Loganiaceae (sometimes Strychnaceae). The genus includes about 200 accepted species of trees and lianas. The genus is widely distributed around the world&#x27;s tropics and is noted for the presence of poisonous indole alkaloids in the roots, stems and leaves of various species. Among these alkaloids are the well-known and virulent poisons strychnine and curare.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;strychnos&quot; was applied by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural History&quot; to &quot;Solanum nigrum&quot;. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek στρύχνον (&quot;strúkhnon&quot;) – &quot;acrid&quot;, &quot;bitter&quot;. The meaning of the word &quot;strychnos&quot; was not fixed in Ancient Greece, where it could designate a variety of different plants having in common the property of toxicity.

==Distribution==
The genus has a pantropical distribution.

==Taxonomy==
The genus is divided into 12 sections, though it is conceded that the sections do not reflect evolution of the genus, and all sections except &quot;Spinosae&quot; are polyphyletic:

* &quot;Strychnos&quot; (53 species)
* &quot;Rouhamon&quot; (21 species)
* &quot;Breviflorae&quot; (32 species)
* &quot;Penicillatae&quot; (17 species)
* &quot;Aculeatae&quot; (1 species)
* &quot;Spinosae&quot; (4 species)
* &quot;Brevitubae&quot; (18 species)
* &quot;Lanigerae&quot; (32 species)
* &quot;Phaeotrichae&quot; (1 species)
* &quot;Densiflorae&quot; (8 species)
* &quot;Dolichantae&quot; (9 species)
* &quot;Schyphostrychnos&quot; (1 species)

==Selected species==

*&quot;Strychnos benthami&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos camptoneura&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos chromatoxylon&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos cocculoides&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos elaeocarpa&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos icaja&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos ignatii&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos madagascariensis&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos mellodora&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos millepunctata&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos nux-blanda&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos potatorum&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos psilosperma&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos pungens&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos spinosa&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos staudtii&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos tetragona&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos toxifera&quot; 
*&quot;Strychnos usambarensis&quot; 
* The strychnine tree, &quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot;, native to tropical Asia, is the source of the poison strychnine.
* &quot;Strychnos tonga&quot;, native to Tonga, is a synonym of &quot;Strychnos spinosa&quot;.
* &quot;Strychnos ignatii&quot; (&quot;St. Ignatius bean&quot;), is a closely related Asian shrub/tree.
* The species &quot;Strychnos toxifera&quot; is a principal plant source of the arrow poison curare.
* Three trees from Southern Africa, commonly known as &quot;monkey oranges&quot;, are drought-tolerant and produce popular edible fruits: the corky-barked monkey orange or suurklapper, &quot;Strychnos cocculoides&quot;; the Natal orange or green or spiny monkey orange, &quot;Strychnos spinosa&quot;; and the black or spiny-leaved monkey orange &quot;Strychnos pungens&quot;.
* The ripe seeds of &quot;Strychnos potatorum&quot;, known as Therran or Nirmal, can be ground and used as a coagulant to purify water; or they may be rubbed against the inside walls of the earthenware water containers. Mrs Grieve&#x27;s Herbal of 1931 also mentions traditional water purification uses of an Indian species called &quot;Strychnos pseudo&quot; (not a valid botanical name).
*Two very well preserved fossilised corollas with stamens and styles from flowers of a plant that has been named &quot;Strychnos electri&quot; (the Latin name of amber is &quot;electrum&quot;), believed to be a vine, were discovered in amber from the Dominican Republic. The amber is from tropical tree &quot;Hymenaea protera&quot;, formerly abundant but now extinct, which formed part of the forest canopy. The age of the amber is believed to be between 15 and 45 million years, from the mid-Tertiary period. This demonstrates an early date for these plants.

<text>Love Stinks is the ninth studio album by American rock band the J. Geils Band. The album was released on January 28, 1980, by EMI Records.

The title song, &quot;Love Stinks&quot;, is a rant against unrequited love. It has been covered by industrial metal band Bile, by Andru Branch in the film &quot;Love Stinks&quot;, Joan Jett in the film &quot;Mr. Wrong&quot; and Adam Sandler in the film &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that the single &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Wait&quot; has &quot;earthy old wave rock guitar riffing, with a souped up synthesized farfisa organ sound.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; called it &quot;certified boogie music with a hook that will grab summer listeners.&quot; &quot;Classic Rock History&quot; critic Brian Kachejian named &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Wait&quot; as the band&#x27;s 7th best song, stating that &quot;The song’s Farfisa organ lick was very symbolic of the sound of the early 1980s, when all styles of music were merging into a new wave-type sound.&quot;

<text>Simeon James Rice (; born February 24, 1974) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Illinois Fighting Illini and was selected by the Arizona Cardinals third overall in the 1996 NFL draft.

In his 12-year NFL career, Rice recorded 122 sacks, forced 25 fumbles, recovered 8, and intercepted 5 passes. His sacks rank 21st all-time in NFL. In his first eight out of 10 seasons in the NFL, Rice recorded at least 10 sacks and in three of those seasons he recorded at least 15 sacks. He earned three Pro Bowl selections and earned a Super Bowl ring with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII, beating the Oakland Raiders. He has also played for the Denver Broncos, Indianapolis Colts, and New York Sentinels.

==Early life==
Rice attended Mount Carmel High School on Chicago&#x27;s south side, the same school as former NFL quarterback Donovan McNabb and former NBA star Antoine Walker.
Simeon Rice was born February 24, 1974, in Chicago, Illinois. He was the second born of five children. His family lived in a 5 bedroom house on Chicago&#x27;s south side. His father worked on the assembly line at Ford Motor Company and his mother was a Special Education school teacher who worked with troubled children.

Rice first became interested in football while playing pickup games with his brother in their neighborhood. His father knew that his son had the physical gifts of speed, size and strength to be a great athlete, but he insisted that Simeon understand the importance of hard work. When the time came for Simeon to attend high school, his parents sent him to Mt. Carmel, an all-boys Catholic school about an hour from where the Rice family lived. The school had a history of winning state championships. The school was so successful that the University of Notre Dame was consistently making recruiting visits.

Rice began his career at Mt. Carmel as a running back. The roster was so deep that Coach Frank Lenti moved Simeon to tight end and defensive end before his junior season. Simeon fought the move, purposely dropping passes and missing tackles in practice. He still did not see much action in games. Before his senior season, Coach Lenti had a talk with Simeon and told him there was still time to be great at football, but he had to accept that he was better suited for defense. His senior season, he got better with every game, starting with the first game of the season against Joliet Catholic and their star running back, Mike Alstott. In the state championship game, with Mt. Carmel trailing, Simeon had a sack that caused a turnover which gave the team the momentum to mount a comeback victory. Throughout the season, Coach Lenti advocated for schools to recruit Simeon, but few listened. Simeon wound up at the University of Illinois for college.

==College career==
After three days of practice, University of Illinois defensive coordinator Denny Marcin told Rice&#x27;s parents that their son was destined for greatness. He knew what greatness looked like after coaching Lawrence Taylor at North Carolina. In the third game of the season, Rice sacked Houston quarterback Jimmy Klingler three times and was named ABC&#x27;s Player of the Game. That season, he had 9 sacks, a school record for a freshman and was voted the Big Ten rookie of the year. Simeon&#x27;s sophomore season was a disappointment for him and the team. Meanwhile, he studied hard and picked up extra credits in an attempt to graduate early. His junior season the team finished 6–5. Rice was a member of what was considered the best linebacker group in the country. His fellow linebacker Dana Howard won the Butkus award for best linebacker in the country. Kevin Hardy, another linebacker on the team, was named the team MVP. Rice had 16 sacks, a school record, and was named a 2nd team All-American. Perhaps his finest game of the season was against Washington State. He had 5 sacks, blocked a field goal, and recovered a fumble. By November, teams were devising special blocking schemes to keep Rice out of the backfield.

After the season, Mel Kiper of ESPN said that Simeon may be the top pick in the draft if he decided to leave school early. His head coach Lou Tepper called around to NFL teams that said that if Rice was selected in the first round, it would not be until the later half. With this information, Rice decided to stay for his senior year. The school attempted to create buzz for Rice to be considered for the Heisman Trophy, but that buzz was killed by their inability to score points. The team finished 5–5–1, but Simeon had another fine season with 12.5 sacks. That season, he became the Big Ten&#x27;s all-time sack leader and finished his degree on time. His intelligence, maturity, an unquestioned ability to rush the quarterback and a 4.5 second time in the 40 yard dash made Rice a sure-fire first round draft choice.

==Pre-Draft==
He attended the NFL Combine and was measured at 6&#x27;4&quot; and weighing 259 pounds. After claiming he could run a 4.5 40-yard dash, he was timed as running it in 4.66 seconds.

==Professional career==

===Arizona Cardinals===
In the 1996 NFL draft, Rice was selected in the first round with the third overall pick by the Arizona Cardinals. He was selected after Keyshawn Johnson and Kevin Hardy. After a contract dispute that lasted through training camp, Rice signed a 4-year, $9.5 million deal. Lining up at defensive end, Rice&#x27;s first snap as a pro resulted in a tackle for a 2-yard loss on Indianapolis Colts running back Marshall Faulk. At the end of September, Rice had 5 sacks and was named NFL defensive rookie of the month. At the end of the season, Rice had 12.5 sacks which tied a rookie record and he was voted NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press. In Rice&#x27;s second season with the Cardinals, they finished 4–12. The fans grew impatient with the team. Rice himself lost the admiration of the fans by playing semi-professional basketball for the Philadelphia Power of the USBL. He played 11 minutes a game averaging 2.5 points and was paid $400 a game. In Rice&#x27;s third season, the Cardinals made the playoffs and won their first post-season game since 1947. That season Rice had 10 sacks, 23 quarterback pressures, and 4 fumble recoveries. The following year, the team slipped to 6–10 in part because of injuries to many of their star players. Despite the team&#x27;s poor play, Rice had 16.5 sacks and was named to his first Pro-Bowl. The next season, the year 2000, Rice was due a big pay increase, but the contract negotiation kept him off the field until the second game of the regular season. Rice had 7.5 sacks and the Cardinals fell to 3–13. At the end of the season, Rice was a free agent and was anxious to go to a new team.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Rice to a 5-year deal worth more than $30 million. He joined a defense that carried Tampa Bay to the playoffs the year before. His first season as a Buccaneer, Rice had 64 tackles and 11 sacks and the Buccaneers made the playoffs, but fell to the Philadelphia Eagles, 31–9. After the loss, head coach Tony Dungy was fired. The Buccaneers traded two 1st round picks and two 2nd round picks to the Oakland Raiders for Jon Gruden. Gruden&#x27;s high-energy style and the addition of Keenan McCardell and Michael Pittman to the offense helped the Buccaneers reach the Super Bowl. They beat the Oakland Raiders 48-21 for the first Super Bowl victory in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers&#x27; history. Rice had 5 tackles and 2 sacks in the Super Bowl and 15.5 sacks on the season, including 11 sacks in a 5-game span. Over the next 3 seasons, the Buccaneers only had one with a winning record and lost the only playoff appearance they had. Rice had impressive seasons, recording 15, 12, and 14 sacks. The 2006 season saw the Buccaneers fall to 4-12 and Rice only had 2 sacks in 8 games played. He finished the second half of the season on injured reserve after requiring surgery for his left shoulder due to having bone chips that caused inflammation and soreness.

He was released by the Buccaneers before the start of the next season because of a failed physical. His five seasons of 10+ sacks were a franchise record when he left the team while his eight total seasons of 10+ sacks was fifth most in NFL history.

===2007===
In what would be his final season in the NFL, Rice played six games for the Denver Broncos with five tackles and no sacks and two games for the Indianapolis Colts with one sack. He later stated his regret in playing the year with a shoulder not completely healed. Rice left the NFL with 122 sacks.

After sitting out the 2008 season, Rice signed with the New York Sentinels of the United Football League on August 27, 2009.

==Music and film career==
After football, Rice began a career in the entertainment industry. He started his own Hip-Hop/R&amp;B record label, named &quot;Lucid Dream Entertainment.&quot; Yashi Rice, his younger sister and Legends Football League player, was his first signee. Yashi has released her first single, titled &quot;Serious.&quot; He also appeared in Slum Village video &quot;Climax&quot; along with Saafir and Gary Coleman. A 2009 graduate of the New York Film Academy, Rice premiered his first short film as director, &quot;When I Was King,&quot; two days before the Super Bowl XLV in Dallas.

Rice&#x27;s first feature-length film as director, &quot;Unsullied&quot;, was released on August 28, 2015. The film stars Murray Gray, Rusty Joiner and James Gaudioso.

For the 2021 season, Rice joined WTSP in Tampa, Florida as a co-host for their pregame show &quot;The Blitz&quot;.

==Legacy==
In his first ten seasons, Rice had 119 sacks, which was the most among all players in that span. In four separate seasons, Rice had 14 or more sacks, a mark only exceeded by Reggie White, Bruce Smith, and Kevin Greene. Rice has stated his belief that he should be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, once stating that there is no Hall &quot;without me in it.&quot; As of 2024, he has never been one of the 15 finalists discussed for induction nor has he made it as a semifinalist since 2020. He is currently 21st all-time in sacks in NFL history. Rice was also the second fastest player to achieve 100 career sacks behind Reggie White.

==Personal life==
Rice&#x27;s son Jordan Caroline is a professional basketball player for Kaohsiung Jeoutai Technology. He played college ball at Nevada.

<doc id="1248034" wikidata="Q6559626" url="?curid=1248034" title="List of UK Albums Chart number ones of the 1990s">
<text>The UK Albums Chart is a weekly record chart based on album sales from Sunday to Saturday in the United Kingdom; during the 1990s, a total of 216 albums reached number one. Until 1 February 1994, the chart was compiled each week by Gallup – after this date, it was managed by Millward Brown, who expanded the number of sales figures sampled, and extended the use of electronic point of sale machines. From July 1998 onwards, compilation of the chart was overseen by the Chart Information Network, jointly operated by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and the British Association of Record Dealers. Throughout the decade, the chart was based solely on physical album sales, and each week&#x27;s number one was first announced on Sunday evenings on &quot;The Radio 1 Chart Show&quot;.

The most successful artist of the 1990s was British band Simply Red, who topped the UK Albums Chart for 19 weeks with four different albums. &quot;Stars&quot;, their fourth studio album, sold 3.29 million copies in total, and was the biggest-selling album of both 1991 and 1992. &quot;Stars&quot; was the second biggest-selling album of the decade; it was outsold by Manchester band Oasis&#x27;s second album, &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, which spent 10 weeks at number one during 1995 and 1996, and sold 4.16 million copies. It was the highest-certified album of the 1990s, achieving platinum certification 13 times. Following the album&#x27;s success, Oasis&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, sold 663,000 copies in the first four days of its release, making it the fastest-selling album in UK chart history.

The first number-one album of the 1990s was &quot;...But Seriously&quot; by Phil Collins – released in 1989, &quot;...But Seriously&quot; first reached number one in December of that year, and remained at the top for eight weeks. It stayed at number one for nine weeks during the decade, and was the biggest-selling album of 1990. The final number one of the 1990s was &quot;Come On Over&quot; by Shania Twain. Like &quot;...But Seriously&quot;, &quot;Come on Over&quot; remained at number one into the following decade, and was the biggest-selling album of its year. In chart terms, the most successful album of the nineties was &quot;Spice&quot;, the debut album from the Spice Girls, which spent 15 weeks at number one over five separate runs. The Spice Girls&#x27; record label, Virgin Records, was the most successful label of the decade – with an artist roster that included the Spice Girls, Phil Collins and Meat Loaf, Virgin topped the albums chart with 19 different albums for a total of 62 weeks.

==Number ones==

===By artist===


Eight artists spent 12 weeks or more at number one on the album chart during the 1990s.
===By record label===
Six record labels spent 20 weeks or more at number one on the album chart during the 1990s.
==Christmas number ones==
In the UK, Christmas number one albums are those that are at the top of the UK Albums Chart on Christmas Day. Typically, this will refer to the album that was announced as number one on the Sunday before 25 December—when Christmas Day falls on a Sunday itself, the official number one is considered by the OCC to be the one announced on that day&#x27;s chart. During the 1990s, the following albums were Christmas number ones.

<text>Angèle Christiane Rawiri or Angèle Ntyugwetondo Rawiri (1954-2010) was a Gabonese writer. She was born in 1954 in Port-Gentil, and was the daughter of Georges Rawiri, a Gabonese politician, diplomat and poet who was a friend of President Omar Bongo. She was orphaned age 6. She studied at university in France. She then lived in London for two years, where she worked as a model and actress (notably in supporting roles in James Bond films). She returned to Gabon in the late 1970s and worked as a French-English translator for a Gabonese oil company, Société Nationale Pétrolière Gabonaise (still called Petrogab), while beginning to write. At the end of the 1980s, she returned to France and devoted herself to writing.

Her novel &quot;Elonga&quot;, published in 1980, denounces the scourge of witchcraft and occult sciences through the return home of a young mixed-race man. Her second novel, &quot;G&#x27;amèrakano au carrefour&quot;, was published in 1983. It deals with the confrontation between tradition and modernity in his native country through the story of a young secretary, Toula, who lives in an eccentric and sinister neighbourhood where she rubs shoulders with delinquents and idlers. She longs for a different life. A friend suggests that she lose weight, go out with a rich man and lighten her skin.

It was in France that she completed and published her best-known novel, &quot;The Fury and Cries of Women&quot; (1989), which evokes the frustrations of young people who have lived abroad in relation to certain obstacles in Gabonese society, the weight of families, infidelity and female homosexuality.

She belongs to a new post-independence generation of African novelists with a significant female presence.

She died in November 2010 in Puteaux, near Paris.

Rawiri is also the mother of a young woman who still lives in the Paris region.

She published her first works under the name Ntyugwetondo Rawiri.

<doc id="1248048" wikidata="Q4496589" url="?curid=1248048" title="Chad Hutchinson">
<text>Chad Martin Hutchinson (born February 21, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears. He also is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals. He played college football for the Stanford Cardinal.

==Early life==
Hutchinson started practicing football late in his life as a freshman in Torrey Pines High School. He was a two-year starter at outside linebacker that switched to quarterback as a senior, to take advantage of his mobility and arm strength. Even though he led a run oriented Wing T Offense, he recorded a 50% completion average, 1,441 passing yards and 8 touchdowns.

He was a rare two-sport standout, that also showed the talent to play professional baseball after his fastball was clocked at 94-mph. As a senior, he finished with an 11–0 record, a 1.20 earned-run average, 116 strikeouts and earned the Gatorade National Baseball Player-of-the-Year award.

==College career==
Hutchinson accepted a football scholarship from Stanford University over professional baseball. In 1996 as a redshirt freshman, he was named the starting quarterback over senior Tim Carey. He started slowly, but improved during the season. He suffered a sprained thumb in week seven&#x27;s 41–9 loss against Arizona State University, forcing him to miss practice the week leading up to the game against UCLA. He was still able to guide Stanford on an 80-yard drive in the final minutes to pull off a 21–20 win, where he was seven-of-seven, culminating on a 10-yard touchdown pass to Brian Manning with 0:58 seconds remaining in the contest. His best game was the 38–0 win in the 1996 Sun Bowl against Michigan State University, where he earned Most Valuable Player honors after completing 22 out of 28 passes for 226 yards and one touchdown. He finished the season with 11 starts, 190 out of 312 completions for 2,134 yards, 10 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.

As a sophomore, he started 11 games, completing 189 out of 315 passes for 2,101 yards, 10 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. In the season opener against San Jose State University, he completed 18 out of 36 passes for 302 yards and one touchdown. In the 58–49 win against the University of Oregon, he completed 21 out of 31 passes for 340 yards and tied a school record with 4 touchdowns. In the tenth game against Washington State University he only had one play before leaving with an injured right thumb. In the season finale 21–20 win against the University of California, he completed 21 out of 25 passes for 194 yards and one touchdown.

In July 1998, he left school with two seasons of eligibility remaining, in order to play professional baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals. In two seasons he threw for 4,235 yards, 20 touchdowns and 22 interceptions in 23 starts. At the time he ranked seventh All-time in the school&#x27;s career passing list, fifth in career completion percentage, seventh in career completions, eighth in career attempts, ninth in total offense and eleventh in career touchdown passes. Scouts considered him to be a potential first-round draft choice in the NFL Draft.

His development in football came without the benefit of spring practice, because he also was a starting pitcher for the Stanford Cardinal baseball team. In the spring of 1996, he played as a true freshman and was named the number two starter in the pitching rotation. He compiled a 7–2 record, 70 strikeouts (tied for sixth in the Pac-10) and a 3.51 ERA (fourth in the Pac-10). He also ranked among the league leaders in complete games (4), innings pitched (842) and strikeouts per-nine-innings (7.5). He helped the team finish with a 41–19 record, a second place in the Pac-10 and an appearance in the NCAA West Regional. He received first-team Freshman All-American and honorable-mention All-Pac-10 honors.

As a sophomore, his 8–3 record and 110 strikeouts, helped the team reach the 1997 College World Series. As a junior, he had a 10–5 record, making 115 strikeouts in 99.1 innings. He compiled a career record of 25–11 and ranked eighth all-time in school history in wins and sixth in strikeouts with 299. His career ERA was 4.80. He contributed to the team winning the Pac-10 Southern Division championship in 1997 and 1998.

==Baseball career==
Although Hutchinson had signed a letter of intent to attend Stanford University and was asking for a $1.5 million signing bonus (at the time one of the biggest bonus ever by a draftee), he was still selected 26th overall in the first round because of his potential, after being drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 1995 Major League Baseball Draft. He decided to attend college, even after the Braves met most of his demands.

He was selected in the second round (48th overall) of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. In July , he signed a four-year, $3.5 million contract ($2.4 million signing bonus and a $1.1 million four-year guaranteed contract) to forgo the NFL and play exclusively baseball. He began his professional career with the Class-A New Jersey Cardinals, registering an 0–1 record in 3 starts. He was promoted to the Class-A Advanced Prince William Cannons on August 15. He made five starts, going 2–0 with a 2.79 ERA and earning his first professional win against Salem on August 21, after pitching six innings and allowing two solo homers with a walk and six strikeouts.

In , he completed his first full professional season with a combined 9–11 record between the Arkansas Travelers (AA) and the Memphis Redbirds (AAA). He spent most of the season at Arkansas, where he was 7–11 with a 4.72 ERA in 25 starts. He tied for the team lead in wins (seven) and finished second with 150 strikeouts in 141 innings pitched. He struck out 10 or more in three of his starts and was a part of three combined shutouts. He allowed just one hit and had 11 strikeouts in 8 innings pitched during a win at Shreveport (8/6), leading to his selection as Texas League Pitcher for the week ending August 8. On August 27, he was promoted to Memphis and made two starts, going 2–0 with a 2.19 ERA. He earned a win at Vancouver by striking out 11 in 6 innings. On September 27, he was recalled by the St. Louis Cardinals but did not appear in any games.

In , he struggled through an injury-plagued campaign in which he split time between the Memphis Redbirds (AAA) and the Arkansas Travelers (AA). He pitched only 56.1 innings on the year, posting 63 strikeouts and ranking eighth in the Cardinals organization with 10.1 strikeouts-per-nine innings pitched. He opened the season at Memphis, but got off to a bad start before being sent to Arkansas. He pitched well in 8 starts for the Travelers, allowing just one unearned run over 18 innings in one stretch, before being shelved with right elbow problems for more than two months. He returned to pitch three games at season&#x27;s end, recording 15 strikeouts and 3 walks in 11 innings. He then played for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League.

In , he opened the season on the Cardinals&#x27; major league roster and pitching 4 innings in three appearances, before being sent down to the Memphis Redbirds (AAA) on April 22. He remained the rest of the season in Memphis, producing a 4–9 record and a 7.92 ERA in 20 starts. He recorded 111 strikeouts in 97.2 innings and had a 3-game winning streak in July.

Hutchinson spent over four seasons in the Cardinals organization, moving mostly between Class A and Class AAA ball, while compiling a 17–25 record and a 5.63 ERA. He pitched in the Major Leagues in three games, all in relief, for the St. Louis Cardinals during the 2001 season. He did not fare well, giving up 16 base runners (nine hits, six walks, and one hit batsman) and 11 earned runs in just four total innings. His MLB career totals include an 0–0 record, two strikeouts (Ben Petrick and Denny Neagle), and an ERA of 24.75.

==Football career==

===Dallas Cowboys===
Struggling after a stint in minor league baseball, Hutchinson decided to focus on professional football and held an open workout in 2002 that was attended by three teams (Dallas, Chicago and Kansas City). Expecting that he could regain his football form, the Dallas Cowboys won a bidding war for his services on January 26, signing him as an undrafted free agent to a contract that included a $3.1 million bonus, three years guaranteed at $5 million and a no-baseball clause.

In 2002, as a 25-year-old rookie, Hutchinson was named the starter after a struggling Quincy Carter lost to the Arizona Cardinals and engaged in a heated sideline argument with Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones. Hutchinson&#x27;s first start was the 17–14 loss to the Seattle Seahawks where Emmitt Smith broke the NFL all-time rushing record. His best game came against the Jacksonville Jaguars in a 21–19 victory, when he passed for 301 yards (most yards by a rookie since Troy Aikman in 1989) and 2 touchdowns. He finished with nine starts, completing 127 out of 250 attempts for 1,555 yards, 7 touchdown passes, 8 interceptions and set an NFL rookie record by throwing 95 straight passes without an interception to start a career (a record later broken in 2016 by Carson Wentz at 134, then by Dak Prescott at 176 in the same season).

In 2003, with the arrival of new head coach Bill Parcells, all positions were opened to competition, and Hutchinson became involved in a publicized quarterback controversy, when he and Carter competed for a roster spot in the 2002 edition of &quot;Hard Knocks&quot;, an HBO series that covers the training camp of an NFL team. Carter eventually regained the starting role, bringing stability to the quarterback position and leading the team to a 10–6 record and a playoff appearance. Hutchinson saw his only action of the season in the sixth game against the Detroit Lions, taking over for Carter for the final four drives (including kneel downs), completing one out of two passes for 8 yards.

In 2004, the Cowboys group of quarterbacks had expanded with the trade for yet another former baseball player (Drew Henson) and the acquisition of Vinny Testaverde off waivers, who was later named the starter after Carter was released on August 4. Hutchinson was waived on July 27. He finished his Cowboys tenure with a 2–7 record, 128 completions out of 252 attempts, 1,563 passing yards, 7 touchdown passes and 8 interceptions. He also became part of a succession of short-tenured quarterbacks following the retirement of Aikman, which included Carter, Randall Cunningham, Testaverde, Drew Bledsoe, Anthony Wright, Ryan Leaf, Henson and Clint Stoerner.

===Rhein Fire===
In 2004, the Cowboys allocated Hutchinson to the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe, so he could work on his accuracy and mechanics. He played inconsistently before suffering a sprained right shoulder in the week 8 contest against the Cologne Centurions, forcing him to miss the final 2 games and losing nearly a month rehabilitating it back to health. He had a 3–5 record, completing 126 out of 207 passes for 1,356 yards, 5 touchdowns and 4 interceptions.

===Chicago Bears===
On September 29, 2004, Hutchinson was signed as a free agent by the Chicago Bears, after Rex Grossman suffered a season-ending knee injury in the third game of the season, reuniting with quarterback coach Wade Wilson who also held that position with the Cowboys. He would become the fourth quarterback that year to start for the team, after Jonathan Quinn and Craig Krenzel were ineffective in their appearances.

Grossman was the projected starter entering the 2005 season, until suffering a broken ankle in preseason. Although Hutchinson was initially named the starter, he was eventually replaced in favor of rookie Kyle Orton, after he had poor preseason performances and the decision to sign Jeff Blake to be the backup. Following his demotion, he was released on August 31.

==Personal life==
Hutchinson lives with his wife and son. His wife is the sister of baseball player Todd Walker. His father Lloyd was an outfielder in the Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; farm system and his brother Trevor was a pitcher in the Florida Marlins organization.

<doc id="1248050" wikidata="Q3752969" url="?curid=1248050" title="Freeze Frame (The J. Geils Band album)">
<text>Freeze-Frame is the tenth studio album by American rock band the J. Geils Band, and the last one to feature original vocalist Peter Wolf. The album was released on October 26, 1981, by EMI Records. It reached number one on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in February 1982, and remained at the top for four weeks. The album featured the hit singles &quot;Centerfold&quot; (No. 1 US; No. 3 UK) and &quot;Freeze Frame&quot; (No. 4 US). &quot;Angel in Blue&quot; also reached the US Top 40.

Keyboardist Seth Justman wrote or co-wrote all of the album as well as receiving credit as arranger and producer of the material.

==Critical reception==

A 2013 &quot;Spin&quot; article called &quot;Flamethrower&quot; the band&#x27;s funkiest song and said: &quot;With three avant-gardish anomalies that flirted with harmolodic punk-jazz funk (&quot;Rage in the Cage,&quot; &quot;Insane, Insane Again,&quot; and &quot;River Blindness&quot;) balancing out three slick Top 10 pop hits, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Freeze Frame&quot; holds the rare if not impossible distinction of being simultaneously both the J. Geils Band&#x27;s most blatantly pop and mostly blatantly experimental album.&quot;

<doc id="1248051" wikidata="Q11420727" url="?curid=1248051" title="Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)">
<text>The Ministry of State Security (), abbreviated as MGB (), was a ministry of the Soviet Union from 1946 to 1953 which functioned as the country&#x27;s secret police. The ministry inherited the intelligence and state security responsibilities of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) and People&#x27;s Commissariat for State Security (NKGB). The MGB was led by Viktor Abakumov from 1946 to 1951, then by Semyon Ignatiev until Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, upon which it was merged into an enlarged Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD).

==Origins of the MGB==

The MGB was just one of many incarnations of the Soviet State Security apparatus. After the revolution, the Bolsheviks relied on a strong political police or security force to support and control their regime. During the Russian Civil War, the Cheka were in power, relinquishing it to State Political Directorate (GPU) in 1922 after the fighting was over. 

The GPU was then renamed The People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) in 1934. From the mid-1930s and until the creation of the KGB, this &quot;Organ of State Security&quot; was re-organized and renamed multiple times. In 1941, the state-security function was separated from the NKVD and became the People&#x27;s Commissariat for State Security (NKGB), only to be reintegrated a few months later during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. 

In 1943, the NKGB was once again made into an independent organization in response to the Soviet occupation of parts of Eastern Europe. SMERSH—anecdotally derived from a phrase translated as &quot;Death to Spies&quot;—was designed to be a counter-intelligence unit within the Red Army to ensure the loyalty of the army personnel. 

Following the end of the war, both the NKVD and the NKGB were converted to ministries and redubbed the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and the Ministry for State Security (MGB). The MGB and MVD merged again in 1953, orchestrated by Lavrentiy Beria, who was then arrested and executed. The KGB took on the mantle of the NKGB/MGB and, in 1954, broke off from the reformed MVD.

==Functions of the MGB==
The MGB essentially inherited the &quot;secret police&quot; function of the old NKVD, conducting espionage and counterespionage, as well as enacting a policy of supervision and surveillance to keep control and to prevent disloyalty. After World War II, the MGB was used to bring the newly acquired Eastern Bloc under Soviet control. It enforced rigid conformity in the satellite states of Eastern Europe and infiltrated and destroyed anticommunist, anti-Soviet, or independent groups.

The protection, policing, and supervision of the Soviet Union fell to this new agency, as it was the main agency responsible for the security of the Union. The MGB directed espionage networks at home and abroad, and also organized both domestic and foreign counterintelligence. They were also responsible for enforcing security regulations, monitoring and censoring information leaving or coming into the country; and supervising the vast majority of Soviet life, including the planting and organizing of agents to track and monitor public opinion and loyalty; as well as ensuring the safety of important government and party officials.

The MGB, above all else, was a security organization, and as such, was designed for covert and clandestine surveillance and supervision. The intelligence apparatus was able to permeate every level and branch of state administration, with agents planted in collective farms, factories, and local governments, as well as throughout the upper level and rank and file of Soviet bureaucracy. Each department within the government also had their own official supervisor, a &quot;Special Section&quot; staffed by the MGB to keep tabs on and regulate the employees, and to ensure the absence of disloyalty.

The Ministry retained a high level of autonomy and a remarkable amount of freedom of operation within the Soviet system, as the agency was only responsible to the Central Committee. MGB agents had the power to arrest and sentence opponents upon receiving approval from a higher authority, a clause oft ignored. The OSO (the Special Council of the State Security Ministry) convicted arrestees charged with committing political crimes, including espionage, and could banish them from certain areas, or from the USSR entirely. 

In Stalin’s last years, between 1945 and 1953, more than 750,000 Soviet citizens were arrested and punished. Many of the arrests made by the MGB were founded on flimsy or fabricated evidence, most notably on the &quot;suspicion of espionage&quot; (podozreniye shpionazha, or PSh). Since in many cases it is impossible to prove any espionage activities or even an intention to spy, the case is built on the &quot;suspicion of espionage&quot;, making acquittal impossible.

==Structure==
The general structure of the MGB is much the same as both the organization it came from, the NKGB, and the organization that followed, the KGB

The MGB was composed of several departments or directorates with a specific purpose within the organization.

===Major Departments===

====First Main Directorate====
First Main Directorate was responsible for foreign intelligence. The First Main Directorate maintained surveillance over the &quot;Soviet colony&quot; (SK – Sovetskaya koloniya), i.e., the personnel of Soviet diplomatic, trade, technical, cultural, and other agencies functioning abroad. It also sought to infiltrate foreign governmental bodies, businesses, public organizations, sensitive industrial plants, cultural and educational institutions, etc., placing MGB agents in strategic posts for intelligence-gathering and possible covert action.

In 1947 the GRU (military intelligence) and MGB&#x27;s 1st Main Directorate were combined into the recently created foreign intelligence agency, the Committee of Information (KI), under the control of Vyacheslav Molotov, in an attempt to streamline the intelligence needs of the State. In 1948, the military personnel in KI were returned to the GRU. KI sections dealing with the new East Bloc and Soviet émigrés were returned to the MGB later that year. In 1951, the KI returned to the MGB, as a First Main Directorate of the Ministry of State Security.

====Second and Third Main Directorates====
The Second Main Directorate focused on domestic counterintelligence and acted as an internal security and political police force. The goal of this department was to combat foreign intelligence operations within the USSR and its territories. The Second Directorate worked mainly inside the country to combat foreign espionage and to study the forms and methods used by foreign intelligence services on the territory of the U.S.S.R. The work it did abroad aimed to organize operational-technical intelligence, i.e., the investigation of the forms, working methods and regulations of the intelligence, counterintelligence, and police and administrative organs of foreign countries.

The Third Main Directorate was concerned with military counterintelligence. It carried out many of the same tasks as SMERSH, which it absorbed, as it conducted political surveillance of armed forces. It relied heavily on the Army Special Section to ensure the loyalties of the soldiers and officers. The MGB operatives were used to supervise personnel and daily action, as well as to carry out counterintelligence operations.

====Fifth Main Directorate====
The Fifth Main Directorate evolved out of the Main Secret Political Administration. It was responsible for regulating and repressing real or imagined dissent within the party apparatus and Soviet society. This involved supervising almost every aspect of Soviet life, including the intelligentsia, bureaucracy, general administrative agencies, cultural organizations, educational institutions, and even the party apparatus itself. They investigated the political reliability of the entire population of the Soviet Union, with particular attention to the Party and Soviet apparatus, up to the highest leaders of the Party and government.

They secretly supervised the activity of the entire administrative and economic apparatus of the state and all scientific, public, church, and other organizations. The goal was to hunt down &quot;deviations from the general line,&quot; &quot;opposition leanings&quot; within the party to ferret out and eliminate &quot;bourgeois nationalism&quot; in the Soviet satellites, i.e., anti-Soviet movements under the guise of nationalism.

===Minor Departments===

====Fourth Directorate====
At the beginning of the MGB, the Fourth Directorate was designed as a proto-terrorist force to combat the anti-Soviet underground, nationalist formations, and hostile elements. Viktor Abakumov dissolved this department in 1946, but kept the main players in a Special Service group so that they could continue with the same pattern of violence that the Fourth Directorate was known for. The group was dissolved in 1949. 

Upon the destruction of the Fourth Directorate as a terrorist group, the department was transitioned into Transportation Security. It was responsible for the preparation and security of mobilization and transport. The department was responsible for counterintelligence and surveillance operations within their transport programs.

====Sixth Directorate====
This department was a short-lived organization designed to collect and process Signals Intelligence, or SIGINT. The department was initially composed of the NKGB&#x27;s 5th Directorate (responsible for wartime communications) and an independent cryptography department, the 2nd Special Department. However, this Directorate was competing with another better-funded communications organization, Department ‘R’, which specialized in radio counterintelligence. The 6th Directorate was dissolved in 1949, and its resources and personnel absorbed into the Special Services Department (GUSS), a cryptanalysis and information security branch of the Central Committee.

====Economic Administration====
Known as the ‘K’ Division, this organization supervised the economy and ran economic counterintelligence and industrial security. They were concerned with the implementation of security programs and requirements, as well as the supervision and monitoring of the workers, leading them to make extensive use of the Special Sections within the state and local organizations.

====Second Special Administration====
Sometimes called the Seventh Directorate, this section was responsible for providing the tools, techniques, and manpower to accommodate the physical surveillance needs of the MGB. They offered facilities, devices, and methodology to help with the demands of the intelligence departments. They were able to do both outdoor (tailing) and photographic surveillance, as well as being able to tap phone lines, monitor conversations in other rooms through hidden microphones and covertly examining mail. They also had sections devoted to codes, cryptography, and ciphers.

====Division for the Protection of Leaders====
Otherwise known as the Guards Directorate, they were charged with the personal security of the top party officials. The Division provided personal security to members and alternates of the Presidium of the Central Committee, ministers of the U.S.S.R. and their deputies, secretaries of the Central Committee, and a number of high officeholders specifically listed. The Division was also responsible for guarding important agencies and installations of the secret police themselves.

A number of the top officials from this department were implicated in the Doctors&#x27; Plot, showing the inherent mistrust and suspicion within the Soviet security apparatus.

<doc id="1248056" wikidata="Q2338869" url="?curid=1248056" title="Partial cloverleaf interchange">
<text>A partial cloverleaf interchange or parclo is a modification of a cloverleaf interchange.

The design has been well received, and has since become one of the most popular freeway-to-arterial interchange designs in North America. It has also been used occasionally in some European countries, such as Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.
==Comparison with other interchanges==
*A diamond interchange has four ramps.
*A cloverleaf interchange has eight ramps, as does a stack interchange. They are fully grade separated, unlike a parclo, and have traffic flow without stops on all ramps and throughways.
*A parclo generally has either four or six ramps but less commonly has five or seven ramps.

==Naming==
In Ontario, the specific variation is identified by a letter/number suffix after the name. Ontario&#x27;s naming conventions are used in this article. The letter &quot;A&quot; designates that two ramps meet the freeway &quot;ahead&quot; of the arterial road, while &quot;B&quot; designates that two ramps meet the freeway &quot;beyond&quot; the crossing.

The number designates how many quadrants of the interchange contain ramps. In left-hand drive countries, the ramps function the same as in right-hand drive countries, but ramps with the same designation appear visually reversed. Common parclo configurations include the &quot;parclo A2&quot;, &quot;parclo B2&quot; and &quot;parclo A4&quot;.

The Department of Transportation in the United States refers to the A and B variants without numbers.

Caltrans refers to the A2, B2, and A4 as types L-7, L-8, and L-9 respectively.

==Configurations==

===A2 and B2===

Parclo A2 and B2 configurations contain four ramps. On each side of the freeway there is a loop ramp and a directional ramp. In parclo A2, the loop ramps serve as on-ramps and the directional ramps serve as off-ramps. In parclo B2 the roles are reversed. Both on- and off-ramps require controlled intersections at the arterial road (sometimes loop and directional ramps from the same side of the freeway will utilize the same intersection).

The parclo A2 and B2 are commonly used on rural freeways such as Highway 402 and Highway 416, where the ramps can be added without widening the street overpass/underpass to include deceleration lanes (normally needed on the A4 in order to safely enter the loop ramps that lead to the freeway). The parclo A2 and B2 ramps are also usually longer and allow for higher speeds than their A4 counterparts because of rural land availability. It is possible to upgrade an A2 to an A4 by adding directional ramps, serving arterial-to-freeway traffic that would otherwise be forced to make a left turn to enter the loop ramps.

===A4===

The parclo A4 (also called &quot;six-ramp partial cloverleaf&quot;) contains six ramps. On each side on the freeway, there is an (often multi-lane) exit ramp, followed by a loop ramp and directional ramp entering the freeway. The on-ramps are in the same configuration as a cloverleaf interchange, but there is one off-ramp for each freeway direction instead of two, typically requiring a controlled intersection where the off-ramp meets the arterial road.

The &quot;parclo A4&quot; is one of the most popular designs, as all movements from the arterial road to the entrance ramps are made by right-hand turns, providing for a safer entrance to the freeway by eliminating left-hand turns into opposing traffic (which require queues waiting to make such turns). This also makes logical sense since freeways have a higher capacity than arterials and right-turn ramps serve effectively to absorb capacity and reduce traffic on the arterial.

Some parclos have the right-turning (directional) on-ramp leave the arterial road after the exit ramp intersection. This configuration is often used when another road meets the freeway off-ramp and gives traffic from this road the option of turning right to use the directional on-ramp to enter the freeway.

Traffic exiting the freeway to the arterial road is provided with a long, relatively straight exit ramp, preventing most speed-related rollovers. These exit ramps are also frequently multi-laned to accommodate traffic turning left, right, or going straight ahead in some cases. Traffic signals are commonly installed at the end of the exit ramp to regulate the freeway traffic flowing onto the arterial.

The parclo A4 is particularly well-suited to suburban areas with high traffic levels. Ontario freeways throughout much of the southern portion of the province, especially freeways in the Golden Horseshoe and Ottawa area, use the A4 parclo. These interchanges also exist on some highways in the Montreal area. One issue in suburban areas is the presence of three conflict points in each direction for pedestrians and non-motorised vehicles, the first of which is a moderate speed, low visibility conflict.

Caltrans favors this form for some recent projects, for example the reconstruction of I-880 and other highways in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Los Angeles Area. They often replaced previous full cloverleafs. All exiting traffic for both directions has a relatively straight ramp and is controlled by a traffic light. Running off the road on an entering ramp is much less likely than on an exiting ramp. Metering lights are a common feature on the entering ramps.
The junction of Saskatchewan Highway 1 (east-west), Saskatchewan Highway 39 (south, part of the CanAm route) and Saskatchewan Highway 301 (north) is an A4 parclo. Highway 1 serves as the freeway, while Highway 39/301 is the arterial road.

===B4===
The parclo B4 interchange superficially appears to be a mirror image of the parclo A4. However, the B4 design provides freeway-to-arterial ramps without traffic lights, while traffic turning left from the arterial must cross opposing traffic. Although this design has the potential to flood the arterial with more freeway traffic than the parclo A4, one particular advantage is the ability to coordinate the traffic signals on the arterial in both directions independently. This is useful when there is more through-movement traffic on the arterial than turning traffic.

=== North American examples ===
There are B4 designs in Alberta:
* Deerfoot Trail &amp; 17 Ave in Calgary
* Macleod Trail &amp; Anderson Road in south Calgary: , resulting in significant delays and frequent accidents, despite the higher maximum speed limit on Anderson Road than Macleod Trail. The style of intersection was made necessary due to the presence of a small private cemetery in one quadrant of the interchange: under Alberta&#x27;s &quot;Cemeteries Act&quot; burial sites cannot be seized.

Three exist in British Columbia. In addition, the Solomon Pond Road interchange on I-290 in Northborough, Massachusetts, was converted from a B2 interchange to a B4 interchange in the mid-1990s with the construction of the Solomon Pond Mall. Also, the West Road interchange on I-75 in Woodhaven, Michigan, was upgraded from a B2 to a B4 in the mid 1980s after suburban sprawl had made the B2 interchange obsolete.

In Indiana, the B4 design along IN 37 at its Bloomington interchange with IN 45/46 was retained when the former route was converted to become I-69&#x27;s exit 120 in 2018.

At least four B4 designs are known to exist in Kentucky:
* Cumberland Parkway interchange with US 27 north of Somerset, currently six ghost ramps sit on the northeast part of the interchange for anticipation for the Somerset Northern Bypass extension.
* The US 127 interchange with Interstate 64 in Frankfort.
* US 127 has a second B4 interchange at the Bluegrass Parkway near Lawrenceburg, about 15 miles (24 km) south of the I-64 crossing. This particular interchange is a conversion from a four-loop design at the location of one of the toll booths on the Bluegrass Parkway before its conversion into a freeway. Toll booths were located directly below US 127; through traffic used the through lanes, while both entering and exiting traffic shared a lane directly to the right of the through lanes. The old design was standard for interchanges at toll booths in Kentucky&#x27;s parkway system of controlled-access toll roads; even though tolls have been removed from all of the roads, many of the old designs still exist at former toll booth sites.
* The Taylorsville Road interchange with the I-264 Watterson Expressway in Louisville. The B4 design was necessary in this case because of the angle at which Taylorsville Road crosses the Watterson.

The US 83 interchange on I-80 in North Platte, Nebraska, has also recently been upgraded to a B4 from a diamond.

The parclo B4 is less common in Ontario than the parclo A4, with the only examples being the following:
* Highway 406/St. David&#x27;s Road interchange on the border of St. Catharines and Thorold
* Highway 402/Highway 40 interchange in Sarnia
* Highway 17/Municipal Road 55 interchange in Sudbury
* the interchange at Lauzon Parkway and the E. C. Row Expressway in Windsor

There are two such interchanges in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, along Circle Drive, at College Drive and Attirdge Drive/Preston Avenue N.

The following B4 interchanges were changed from full cloverleafs:
* U.S. 73/K-7 at U.S. 24/U.S. 40/State Avenue near Basehor, Kansas was changed in 2008.
* I-695 at U.S. 40 in Catonsville, Maryland was changed in 2005/2006.
* U.S. 14/U.S. 52 at Civic Center Drive in Rochester, Minnesota was changed from a cloverleaf in 2004/2005.
* I-5 at South 38th Street in Tacoma, Washington was changed in the mid 1990s.

Some parclo B4 interchanges such as the intersection of Interstate 40 and U.S. Route 401 in Raleigh, North Carolina, have been fitted with signals at each ramp meeting the arterial in order to allow more lanes on the offramps. This technique along with the ability to provide two-way signal progression along the arterial allows the parclo B4 to handle an extremely high flow of traffic along the arterial.

=== Other variations ===
Parclo designs with only two quadrants are commonly referred to as folded diamonds, due to their similarity with diamond interchanges. Sometimes the ramps in a folded diamond are actually local streets; surface roads upgraded to higher standards often do this to save money on land acquisition. This type of interchange long predates the parclo; the Merritt Parkway and Queen Elizabeth Way, both built in the 1930s, used mainly folded diamonds and cloverleaves. Another example of this is Highway 401&#x27;s interchange with Highway 2 east of Tilbury (Exit 63): the ramps also have intersections fairly close to the freeway to allow traffic to continue on a rural country road (Jeannette&#x27;s Creek Road / McKinlay Road) which formerly met Highway 2. One of the examples in Asia includes the Clark South exit in SCTEX, which is a AB2 parclo interchange.

Depending on traffic and land needs, hybrid designs, such as the &quot;parclo AB&quot; and &quot;parclo A3&quot;, can be created. A notable example of a parclo AB interchange includes the Highway 417 and the Woodroffe Avenue interchange in Ottawa. Other variants, not describable using Ontario&#x27;s system, eliminate one or more outside ramps, while leaving the loop ramps in those quadrants. In the United States, folded diamonds are frequently used in interchanges with roads that have a railroad line closely paralleling the surface street; entrance/exit ramps are not permitted to have level crossings in modern American practice.

==Implementation==

In California, Caltrans currently has a policy that whenever cloverleaf interchanges between freeways and surface streets are being rebuilt, they are turned into parclo interchanges by removing some of the loop ramps (or in rare cases bridges will be added between adjacent loop ramps—see cloverleaf interchange for details).

Various forms of parclo interchanges are used on the North Luzon Expressway in the Philippines. The configuration of parclo interchanges allows for the consolidation of toll barriers at points where onramps and offramps run alongside each other. A single large barrier can serve each onramp/offramp pair simultaneously, reducing construction and operation expenses at through junctions. When possible, such as at terminal junctions, trumpet interchanges are preferred since they only require one large toll barrier for all four on/off-ramps.

<text>Curt Herzstark (January 26, 1902 – October 27, 1988) was an Austrian engineer. During World War II, he designed plans for a mechanical pocket calculator (the &quot;Curta&quot;).

==Life and career==
Herzstark was born in Vienna, the son of Marie and Samuel Jakob Herzstark. His father was Jewish and his mother, born a Catholic, converted to Lutheranism and raised Herzstark Lutheran. 

In 1938, while he was technical manager of his father&#x27;s company Rechenmaschinenwerk Austria Herzstark &amp; Co., Herzstark had already completed the design of the Curta, but could not manufacture it due to the Nazi German annexation of Austria. Instead, the company was ordered to make measuring devices for the German Army. In 1943, perhaps influenced by the fact that his father was a liberal Jew, the Nazis arrested him for &quot;helping Jews and subversive elements&quot; and &quot;indecent contacts with Aryan women&quot; and sent him to the Buchenwald concentration camp. However, the reports of the army about the precision-production of the firm and especially about the technical expertise of Herzstark led the Nazis to treat him as an &quot;intelligence-slave&quot;.

His imprisonment at Buchenwald seriously threatened his health, but his condition improved when he was called to work in the factory linked to the camp, which was named after Wilhelm Gustloff. There, he was ordered to make a drawing of the construction of his calculator, so that the Nazis could ultimately give the machine to the Führer as a gift after the successful end of the war. The preferential treatment this allowed ensured that he survived his stay at Buchenwald until the camp&#x27;s liberation in 1945, by which time he had redrawn the complete construction from memory.

Herzstark died in Nendeln, Liechtenstein.

==In popular culture==
The Curta is referenced in chapter four of William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot;. The chapter is entitled &#x27;Math Grenades&#x27;, which refers to protagonist Cayce Pollard mistaking a box of them for hand grenades at first glance.

<text>Dr. Nguyễn Xuân Ngãi was born in South Vietnam. He is a Vietnamese American and serves as the Vice-Chairman of the People&#x27;s Action Party of Vietnam.

==Biography==

He had served in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) as a young Medical Officer at Nguyen Van Hoc Hospital in Saigon.

During the Fall of Saigon, he was a Medical Officer. He chose to remain and protect his patients at the hospital in Saigon instead of trying to move to the US like others.

On April 30, 1975, he was imprisoned by the Communist Vietnamese government for three years and was released. He secretly left Vietnam and immigrated to the United States.

In 2002, he was invited by the Vietnamese government Public Health Ministry, to teach Vietnamese doctors the techniques of angioplasty and angiograms.

Dr. Nguyen Xuan Ngai&#x27;s work was praised within the medical field in Vietnam and was reported by media networks throughout Vietnam. This alarmed the Vietnamese Communist when news spread throughout the media that Dr. Nguyen Xuan Ngai was also involved with an opposition organization known as the People&#x27;s Action Party of Vietnam.

On March 1, 2002, Communist Police arrived at his hotel in Saigon and seized his passport, visa and airplane ticket. He was accused of having tried to overthrow the Vietnamese Communist government, a crime that can carry the death penalty.

There was an outcry by the Vietnamese Community in the United States and after one week he was eventually released and allowed to return to the United States.

<doc id="1248062" wikidata="Q21012160" url="?curid=1248062" title="Electronic news gathering">
<text>Electronic news gathering (ENG) or electronic journalism (EJ) is usage of electronic video and audio technologies by reporters to gather and present news instead of using film cameras. The term was coined during the rise of videotape technology in the 1970s. ENG can involve anything from a single reporter with a single professional video camera, to an entire television crew taking a truck on location.

==Beginnings==

===Shortcomings of film===
The term ENG was created as television news departments moved from film-based news gathering to electronic field production technology in the 1970s. Since film requires chemical processing before it can be viewed and edited, it generally took at least an hour from the time the film arrived back at the television station or network news department until it was ready to be broadcast. Film editing was done by hand on what was known as &quot;color reversal&quot; film, usually Kodak Ektachrome, meaning there were no negatives. Color reversal film had replaced black-and-white film as television itself evolved from black-and-white to color broadcasting. Filmo cameras were most commonly used for silent filming, while Auricon cameras were used for filming with synchronized sound. Since editing required cutting the film into segments and then splicing them together, a common problem was film breaking during the newscast. News stories were often transferred to bulky 2-inch videotape for distribution and playback, which made the content cumbersome to access.

Film remained important in daily news operations until the late 1960s, when news outlets adopted portable professional video cameras, portable recorders, wireless microphones and joined those with various microwave- and satellite truck-linked delivery systems. By the mid-1980s, film had all but disappeared from use in television journalism.

===Transition to ENG===

As one cameraman of the era tells it,

This portability greatly contributed to the rise of electronic news gathering as it made portable news more easily accessible than ever before.

Early portable video systems recorded at a lower quality than broadcast studio cameras, which made them less desirable than non portable video systems. When the Portapak video camera was introduced in 1967, it was a new method of video recording, forever shifting ENG.

By the time videotape technology advanced, the capability for microwave transmission was well established (and used in the 1960s by the BBC&#x27;s ill-fated Mobile Film Processing Unit). But the convenience of videotape finally allowed crews to more easily use microwave links to quickly send their footage back to the studio. It even made live feeds more possible, as in the police shootout with the Symbionese Liberation Army in 1974. Also in 1974, KMOX, a station in St. Louis, Mo., was the first to abandon film and switch entirely to ENG. Stations all over the country made the switch over the next decade.

During the mid-to-late 1970s, several companies, such as RCA, Sony, and Ikegami released portable one-piece color television cameras designed for ENG use. These included the RCA TK-76, Sony BVP-300, and the Ikegami HL-79. These cameras became popular with television stations. These cameras utilized vidicon tubes to capture video as solid-state imagers (such as CCDs) would not be practical in broadcasting until the late 1980s. In 1974, Sony introduced the VO-3800 portable 3/4&quot; U-matic videocassette recorder, which was followed up by the BVU-100, BVU-110, and BVU-50 U-matic recorders, which were also popular with broadcasters for ENG use. 

ENG greatly reduces the delay between when the footage is captured and when it can be broadcast, thus enabling news gathering and reporting to become steady cycle with little time in between when story breaks and when a story can air. Coupled with live microwave and/or satellite trucks, reporters were able to show live what was happening, bringing the audience into news events as they happened.

CNN launched in June 1980, as ENG technologies were emerging. The technology was still in its developmental stages, and had yet to be integrated with satellites and microwave relays, which caused some problems with the network&#x27;s early transmissions. However, ENG proved to be a crucial development for all television news as news content recorded using videocassette recorders was easier to edit, duplicate and distribute. Over time, as editing technology has become simpler and more accessible, video production processes have largely passed from broadcast engineers to producers and writers, making the process quicker.

However, initially the ENG cameras and recorders were heavier and bulkier than their film equivalents. This restricted the ability of camera operators from escaping danger or hurrying toward a news event. Editing equipment was expensive and each scene had to be searched out on the master recording.

==Technology developments==
Using technology such as multicast or RTP over UDP, these systems achieve similar performance to high end-microwave. Since the video stream is already encoded for IP, the video can be used for traditional television broadcast or Internet distribution without modification (live to air).

As mobile broadband has developed, broadcast devices using this technology have appeared. These devices are often more compact than previous technology and can aggregate multiple mobile data lines to deliver a high definition-quality content live. These devices are known as Digital Mobile News Gathering (DMNG).

==Broadcast video equipment==
The ongoing technological evolution of broadcast video production equipment can be observed annually at the NAB Show in Las Vegas where equipment manufacturers gather to display their wares to people within the video production industry. The trend is toward lighter-weight equipment that can deliver more resolution at higher speeds. There has been an evolution from film to standard-definition television, high-definition television and now 4K.

As of 2016, highlights included unmanned aerial vehicles aka drones for the delivery of aerial footage, various lines of cameras that can deliver 4K resolution, graphics packages for news stations, which can be utilized inside their microwave and/or satellite vehicles, wireless technology, POV cameras and peripherals from GoPro and other action camera manufacturers, and the Odyssey 7Q+ monitor with Apollo multi-camera switcher/recorder from Convergent Design. This monitor fits on the back of a broadcast video camera and allows photojournalists to live-switch a multi-camera production in studio or on location.

==Outside broadcasts==

Outside broadcasts (also known as &quot;remote broadcasts&quot; and &quot;field operations&quot;) are when the editing and transmission of the news story are done outside the station&#x27;s headquarters. Use of ENG has made possible the greater use of outside broadcasts.

&quot;Some stations have always required reporters to shoot their own stories, interviews and even standup reports and then bring that material back to the station where the video is edited for that evening&#x27;s newscast. At some of these stations, the reporters sometimes even anchor the news and introduce the packages they have shot and edited.&quot;

Short-form news stories are what local news reporters deliver to their stations. Longer-form stories about the same topics are covered by national or international broadcast news magazines such as &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;48 Hours&quot;, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;Inside Edition&quot;. Depending upon the scope of the story, the number of crews vying for position at the story venue (press conference, courthouse, crime location, etc.) can potentially be dozens.

Natural disasters, terrorism, death and murder are topics that reside at the top of the news-gathering hierarchy. For instance, in the U.S., the series of events culminating in what would thereafter be known as 9/11 galvanized every news division of every network.

&quot;Especially on that first day, you were really just going to whomever had a piece of information,&quot; said &quot;48 Hours&quot; executive producer Susan Zirinsky, whose team produced the primetime coverage that first night. &quot;You were getting cameras up, you were putting people in place, you were trying to wrap your brain around it. You wanted to step back and synthesize some of the information, which is what we were trying to do ... At that point, we thought there were many more dead, and it was still a search-and-rescue mission. It was a very, very complicated day to try to give context to.&quot;

&quot;There is a hierarchy of news. It&#x27;s a hierarchy of judgment, I guess. All deaths are equal to the victims and their families. But all deaths are not equal in the calculation of news value.&quot;

&quot;Feel-good stories&quot; such as the saving of a life, or selfless act of kindness, sometimes make their way into the news stream.

==Microwave spectrum channels==
In the United States, there are ten ENG video channels set aside in each area for terrestrial microwave communications. TV Broadcast Auxiliary Services (BAS) Channel A10 (2483.5-2500 MHz) is only available on a grandfathered basis to TV BAS licensees holding authority to use that channel as of July 10, 1985. However, there is no sunset date to the grandfather rights, and continued use of A10 remains on a protected, co-primary basis with Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) use of 2483.5-2495 MHz. Use of these channels is restricted by federal regulations to those holding broadcast licenses in the given market, to Broadcast Network-Entities, and to Cable Network-Entities. Channels 1 through 7 are in the 2 GHz band and channels 8, 9 and 10 are in the 2.5 GHz band. In Atlanta for example, there are two channels each for the four news-producing television stations (WSB-TV, WAGA-TV, WXIA-TV, WANF), one for CNN, and another open for other users on request, such as Georgia Public Broadcasting.

Traditionally, the Federal Communications Commission has assigned microwave spectrum based on historic patterns of need and through the application/request process. With the other uses of radio spectrum growing in the 1990s, the FCC made available some bands of spectrum as unlicensed channels. This included spectrum for cordless phones and Wi-Fi. As a result, some of these channels have been used for news gathering by websites and more informal news outlets. One major disadvantage of unlicensed use is that there is no frequency coordination, which can result in interference or blocking of signals.

==Audio journalism==
A common set-up for journalists is a battery operated cassette recorder with a dynamic microphone and optional telephone interface. With this set-up, the reporter can record interviews and natural sound and then transmit these over the phone line to the studio or for live broadcast.

Electronic formats used by journalists have included DAT, MiniDisc, CD and DVD. Minidisc has digital indexing and is re-recordable, reusable medium; while DAT has SMPTE timecode and other synchronization features. In recent years, more and more journalists have used smartphones or iPod-like devices for recording short interviews. The other alternative is using small field recorders with two condenser microphones.

<text>The Audi V8 (&quot;Typ&quot; 4C) is a four-door, full-size luxury sedan, designed, manufactured and marketed by Audi in Germany from 1988 to 1993, as the company&#x27;s flagship. As the first car from Audi to use a V8 engine, also was the first Audi to combine a quattro system with an automatic transmission. Early cars used 3.6-litre V8s, while later cars featured a 4.2-litre version of the engine. The Audi V8 was replaced by the Audi A8 in 1994, although the A8 was not marketed in North America until 1996.

The competition model of the Audi V8 won back-to-back Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft driver&#x27;s titles in 1990 and 1991, with the championship winners being Hans-Joachim Stuck and Frank Biela respectively. Audi was the first company to win back-to-back DTM titles.

==Overview==
Standard features for the Audi V8 included a 32-valve, double overhead camshaft (DOHC) V8 engine and a four-speed electronically controlled ZF 4HP24A automatic transmission providing Audi&#x27;s quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. A five-speed (later in production six-speed) manual transmission was also available.

The Audi V8 had a galvanized steel body, with a 10-year anti-perforation warranty (against corrosion). The Audi V8 was specifically designed to be a top of the range &#x27;flagship&#x27; car and included a number of luxury features as standard equipment, including leather seating and Audi&#x27;s quattro all wheel drive system (see standard features list). The Audi V8 created a new elevated image for the company, providing a viable alternative to established competitors such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW. In this regard, the car was a cornerstone in developing the history of the Audi marque as it is today.

Factory production commenced in October 1988, and ceased in November 1993, although sales of completed vehicles continued in 1994. It was replaced by the Audi A8 in 1994.

==Body style==
The Audi V8 used an enlarged version of the bodyshell from the &quot;Typ&quot; 44 Audi 100 and 200 models, and was based on a stretched version of their Volkswagen Group C3 automobile platform, known either as the D1 or D11 platform. The Audi V8 differed from the Audi 100/200 with a unique grille attached to the hood, new bumpers and headlights, all-red tail lamps, 12 mm extended wheelbase, wider track, pronounced fenders, and more wood trim in the interior. Furthermore, only alloy wheels were offered, ranging from 15 to 17 inches.

In addition to the standard-length model, there was also a long wheelbase (LWB), (&#x27;Lang&#x27; in German) version of the V8 (refer to the infobox for differences in dimensions). It was assembled at Steyr-Daimler-Puch factory in Graz (see production figures). This tradition would continue with the A8, offered in &quot;A8L&quot; format (though only in year 2010 A8L reached the size of the V8L).

A once-off experimental Avant (estate) version was built for the wife of former Audi CEO Ferdinand Piech. This car is no longer on display at the Audi Forum Ingolstadt, but in storage in Neckarsulm.
==Powertrain==
Powertrain detail of the Audi V8 featured one of two all-new, all-aluminium alloy engines – both petrol engines, and both in V8 configuration with 32 valves (four valves per cylinder) with dual valve springs, and four overhead camshafts (DOHC). The design set the pattern for future Audi-developed Volkswagen Group V8 engines. In addition to using an all-aluminum alloy cylinder block (when the established material was grey cast iron), the camshafts were driven using a hybrid method. A rubber/kevlar toothed timing belt, driven from the front of the crankshaft operated only the exhaust camshaft in each bank. The inlet camshafts were then operated via a simplex roller chain from the exhaust camshaft – the right bank, (cylinders 1–4) at the rear of the engine, and the left bank (cylinders 5–8) at the front of the engine, immediately behind the timing belt. This method reduced the complexity of the timing belt layout, and as a result, required fewer components, such as idler rollers and guides, and led to easier and less costly maintenance of the timing belt and associated components. The intervals for changing the timing belts varied; the 3.6 V8 (PT) required changing every , whereas the 4.2 V8 (ABH) had a longer interval at . A thermostatically controlled electric cooling fan also became standard, replacing the engine-driven viscous fans on earlier cars. This not only provided forced airflow for the engine coolant radiator, but also for the smaller engine oil cooler.

Audi&#x27;s &#x27;trademark&#x27; quattro permanent (or semi-permanent, dependent on gearbox type) four-wheel drive system was the only offering for the drivetrain. This normally distributes the engine torque as a &#x27;default&#x27; 50:50 between front and rear axles, but can automatically dynamically apportion up to a bias of 20:80 to 80:20 front and rear. The automatic transmission utilizes a hydraulically controlled multi-plate clutch to apportion drive between front and rear axles, whereas the manual transmission variants utilize a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing center differential. The rear axle final drive unit contains a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing differential, instead of the more common hypoid open differential.

===Engines===

Both available engines used a Bosch Motronic fully electronic engine control unit (ECU), with cylinder bank selective knock control, dual-barrel throttle valve, lambda mixture control via intake air volume metering and exhaust gas temperature sensor, and required unleaded petrol. Fuel was delivered to the combustion chambers via eight intake manifold-sited electronic fuel injectors, fed from two common fuel rails (one per cylinder bank), and were sequentially &#x27;fired&#x27; or activated in accordance with the engine&#x27;s firing order. Whilst the 3.6 V8 was able to use 95 RON (91 AKI) fuel, for the 4.2 V8, the more expensive 98 RON (93 AKI) &#x27;SuperPlus&#x27; unleaded was required in order to achieve the quoted power output. The usage of 95 RON in the 4.2 V8 resulted in a lower power output, as well as increased fuel consumption.

At the initial launch of the Audi V8, the only offering was the 3.6-litre powerplant, which displaced . This V8 engine was derived from the 1.8 16V engine from the Golf GTI. It was DIN-rated with a maximum motive power output of at 5,800 revolutions per minute (rpm), and generated a torque turning force of at 4,000 rpm. In August 1991, Audi introduced a 4.2-litre engine, displacing , to complement the choice of the existing 3.6-litre V8. This shared many components from the 3.6 V8, and the 4.2 unit was identical to the optional V8 used in the Audi S4 (aka &quot;Ur-S4&quot;), sharing the same rated outputs and ABH identification code. Like the 3.6 V8 model, the existing four-speed automatic gearbox remained available. However, a new six-speed manual gearbox replaced the five-speed manual. This powerplant is identified by chrome &#x27;V8&#x27; badges on the front grille and at trunk lid, where in some cars also &#x27;4.2 quattro&#x27; badge is present.

====Details and performance====
===Transmissions===
A choice of transmissions were offered. A ZF Friedrichshafen-sourced four-speed 4HP24A automatic transmission with a torque converter was available throughout the V8 production run. Automatic transmission has three modes: &quot;S&quot; – Sport; &quot;E&quot; – Economic and &quot;M&quot; – Manual operation. St mode changes gears at higher rpms than E; M allows the driver to select gears using the lever. There were also two manual transmission offerings – for the 3.6: a five-speed manual gearbox, or later for the 4.2, a six-speed manual. Both manual transmission variants used a single-plate clutch.

====Details====
The details of Audi V8 transmission are shown in the table below:
==Steering, brakes, wheels==
The Audi V8 came equipped with rack and pinion power assisted steering (PAS) as standard. An electronically controlled variable assisted &#x27;servotronic&#x27; version was also available. It was fitted with a high-performance brake system, which included radially ventilated disc brakes front and rear. The fronts were rather unusual – designed by Continental AG and sized at in diameter by thick, but the caliper was mounted inside the disc. The fronts also incorporated electronic brake pad wear sensors. The rears were by , and incorporated a cable-operated parking brake. A Bosch anti-lock braking system (ABS) was also standard.

Standard wheels were &#x27;aero&#x27; style light alloy wheels fitted with 215/60 R15 steel-belted radial tyres. Optional multi-spoke BBS-sourced (with Audi centre-cap badge) alloy wheels were also available, in either , or sizes.

==Features==

The Audi V8 came standard with a range of features, including a BOSE audio system with eight speakers, walnut wood trim, leather interior, and heated seats. Some available colors included pearl white, lago blue (teal), blue mica, tornado red and black. All paint finishes were pearlescent or metallic.

==Motorsport==

Audi developed a Group A competition version of the Audi V8 for entry into the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) (German Touring Car Championship) auto racing series equipped with a , later , 3.6 V8 engine and 6-speed manual transmission, and began racing with it in 1990 with Schmidt MotorSport (SMS) running the operation, and Hans-Joachim Stuck, Walter Röhrl and Frank Jelinski driving. In the 1990 DTM season all of the three teams claimed together the entire podium (1st, 2nd and 3rd places) at Hockenheimring race. Stuck won the title, and the following year, Audi added a second team to the mix, Audi Zentrum Reutlingen (AZR). SMS continued with Stuck and Jelinski, while AZR raced with Frank Biela and Hubert Haupt. Biela gave Audi another crown in 1991, but was unable to defend the title in 1992.

For the 1992 season, Audi had changed their engines to use a 180° flatplane crankshaft, which they said had been re-forged and bent from the original 90° crossplane part as used in production model. The DTM organisers found this highly modified crankshaft deviated from original homologated standard crankshaft, and therefore deemed it illegal. Audi subsequently withdrew from the championship.

During its presence at DTM the Audi V8 competed with much smaller and about lighter Mercedes 190, BMW M3, and slightly smaller Opel Omega 3000. None of those cars were equipped with V8 engines or 4-wheel drive.

<doc id="1248070" wikidata="Q3437663" url="?curid=1248070" title="Karl Stromberg">
<text>Karl Sigmund Stromberg is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1977 James Bond film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. Stromberg was portrayed by Curd Jürgens. The character Stromberg was created specifically for the film by writer Christopher Wood. Ian Fleming&#x27;s novel &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; is told from the perspective of a young woman who falls in love with James Bond and its plot is completely different from the film. When Fleming sold the novel&#x27;s rights to Eon Productions, he stipulated that only the title be used.

==Biography==

The webbed-fingered Karl Stromberg is a successful businessman as head of his own shipping firm and chain of laboratories. Stromberg&#x27;s obsession and passion is the ocean where he lives in his palace, named Atlantis, that could submerge itself underwater so as not to be seen or detected. Located off the coast of Sardinia, Italy, Atlantis has everything to support life above and below water for any length of time. In fact, Atlantis is more like a city, able to support dozens if not hundreds of people. Stromberg also owns a huge tanker, named &quot;Liparus&quot;, that serves as his headquarters away from Atlantis. Aboard the tanker he has a small army of red-liveried soldiers. In Christopher Wood&#x27;s novelisation of the film, Stromberg is Swedish and his first name is &quot;Sigmund&quot;.

===Scheme===
Although Stromberg has a passion for the ocean and its various species, he despises the human race, not unlike Jules Verne&#x27;s Captain Nemo. Stromberg, however, has no interest in benefiting the world. He has a congenital condition in which his hands are webbed like those of aquatic birds or mammals. It is his personal mission to start over with a new civilisation underwater via complete anarchy against the &quot;surface world&quot;. After contracting two scientists to create the technology to track nuclear submarines, Stromberg uses this technology to capture a Soviet nuclear submarine and a British submarine. Stromberg&#x27;s specially adapted tanker, &quot;Liparus&quot;, sneaks up on the subs, forces them to the surface through methods using some kind of high frequencies to disrupt the sub&#x27;s electrical system and captures them inside the tanker. 

His plan calls for the firing of nuclear missiles from these subs at Moscow and New York City, thus framing each other&#x27;s government and starting a nuclear war, which would wipe out every last human being on Earth. Among Stromberg&#x27;s many minions were an assistant who betrayed him by trying to sell the plans for the submarine tracking system, and a professor and a doctor who were to help him operate the tracking system after it was complete. He killed his assistant by feeding her to a shark, and killed the professor and the doctor, having outlived their usefulness, by blowing up their helicopter. (In a comic relief after cancelling the payment to the professor and doctor he has his secretary inform the two men&#x27;s families that they have met with an accident and are &quot;buried at sea&quot;.)

This scheme is similar to that of an earlier Bond film, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, which posited stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The idea of commandeering two nuclear missiles and attempting to fire them at two major cities likewise recalls the plot of &quot;Thunderball&quot;. The scheme in which the villain wishes to destroy mankind to create a new race or new civilisation was also used in &quot;Moonraker&quot;, the next film after &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. The film &quot;Moonraker&quot; was also written by Christopher Wood and featured Jaws as a henchman.

===Prevention===
Stromberg&#x27;s scheme is foiled after Bond is taken aboard the &quot;Liparus&quot; as a prisoner from a recently captured American submarine. With Bond&#x27;s help, the crews from the submarines escape and take over the tanker. With the tanker under their control, Bond is able to order the stolen submarines, which were crewed by Stromberg&#x27;s men, to fire their nuclear warheads at each other. Prior to this, however, Stromberg had abducted Bond&#x27;s partner, the Russian agent Anya Amasova, and escaped to his city-ship, Atlantis.

Bond pursues Stromberg, and after two failed attempts by Stromberg to kill him (including the use of an explosive harpoon which ran the length of a dinner table), Bond exercises his licence to kill by shooting Stromberg multiple times in the groin and chest. Atlantis is later torpedoed and sunk, giving Stromberg a burial at sea.

===Henchmen===
* Jaws – survived
* Naomi – blown up by Bond
* Sandor – shot and thrown off the edge of a building by Bond
* &quot;Liparus&quot; Captain – fatally wounded by an explosion
* Professor Markowitz – blown up in helicopter explosion
* Dr. Bechmann – blown up in helicopter explosion
* Stromberg&#x27;s secretary – eaten by shark
* Captain, &quot;Stromberg 1&quot; (formerly Soviet submarine &quot;Potemkin&quot;) – nuked, along with his entire crew, by &quot;Stromberg 2&quot;
* Captain, &quot;Stromberg 2&quot; (formerly British submarine HMS &quot;Ranger&quot;) – nuked, along with his entire crew, by &quot;Stromberg 1&quot;
* Motorbike Henchman – blinded and sent off a cliff
* Three Men in Jaws&#x27; car – all killed in car crash
* A large army of red soldiers

<text>David Dhalatnghu Gulpilil (1 July 1953 – 29 November 2021) was an Australian actor and dancer. He was known for his roles in the films &quot;Walkabout&quot; (1971), &quot;Storm Boy&quot; (1976), &quot;The Last Wave&quot; (1977), &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; (1986), &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; (2002), &quot;The Tracker&quot; (2002), and &quot;Australia&quot; (2008).

An Indigenous Australian and Yolŋu person, he was raised in a traditional lifestyle in Arnhem Land. A skilled dancer, he was noticed by British filmmaker Nicolas Roeg, who cast him in his first feature film role in &quot;Walkabout&quot; (1971). He also made several appearances on stage. 

Recognised as one of Australia&#x27;s greatest actors and a trailblazer for Indigenous Australians in film, he was honoured with numerous awards and honours, including a lifetime achievement award at the 2019 NAIDOC Awards. After his death in November 2021, he was posthumously referred to as David Dalaithngu for a short period at his family&#x27;s request. This was to conform to Indigenous practices that avoid naming the dead.

==Early life and education==
Gulpilil was probably born in 1953. In the 2021 documentary about his life, &quot;My Name is Gulpilil&quot;, he said that he did not know how old he was. Local missionaries recorded his birth on 1 July 1953, based on &quot;guesswork&quot;. He was a man of the Mandjalpingu (Djilba) clan of the Yolngu people, who are an Aboriginal people of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory of Australia.

As a young boy, Gulpilil was an accomplished hunter, tracker, and ceremonial dancer. Gulpilil spent his childhood in the bush, outside the range of non-Aboriginal influences. He did not see a white man until he was 8 years old. He received a traditional upbringing in the care of his family, until the death of his parents. After that, he attended the school at Maningrida in North East Arnhem Land, where he was assigned the English name &quot;David&quot;. When he came of age, Gulpilil was initiated into the Mandhalpuyngu tribal group. His skin group totemic animal was the kingfisher (the meaning of the name &quot;Gulpilil&quot;) and his homeland was Marwuyu.

After appearing in his first film, &quot;Walkabout&quot; (1971), Gulipilil became fluent in English. He added this to his ability to speak several Aboriginal languages.

==Career==
===Film and television===
In 1969, Gulpilil&#x27;s skill as a tribal dancer caught the attention of British filmmaker Nicolas Roeg, who had come to Maningrida scouting locations for a forthcoming film. Roeg promptly cast the 16-year-old unknown to play a principal role in his film &quot;Walkabout&quot;, released in 1971. It was internationally acclaimed, and Gulpilil&#x27;s role was the first time that an Aboriginal character had been portrayed as sexually attractive. Gulpilil&#x27;s on-screen charisma, combined with his acting and dancing skills, was such that he became an instant national and international celebrity. 

The young man travelled internationally, mingled with prominent people, and was presented to heads of state. During these travels to promote the film, he met and was impressed with John Lennon, Bob Marley, Bruce Lee, Marlon Brando, and Jimi Hendrix. He taught Bob Marley how to play the didgeridoo, while Marley introduced him to &quot;ganja&quot;.

Gulpilil appeared in many more films and television productions. He played a lead role in the commercially successful and critically acclaimed &quot;Storm Boy&quot; (1976). He &quot;dominated&quot; the film &quot;The Last Wave&quot; (1977) with his charismatic performance as Chris Lee, a conflicted urban tribal Aboriginal.

A documentary about his life, &quot;Gulpilil: One Red Blood&quot;, was aired on ABC Television in 2003. The title comes from a quote by Gulpilil: &quot;We are all one blood. No matter where we are from, we are all one blood, the same&quot;.

Gulpilil was a major creative influence throughout his life in both dance and film. He initiated and narrated the film &quot;Ten Canoes&quot;, which won a Special Jury Prize at the 2006 Cannes Festival. The low-budget film, based on a 1,000-year-old traditional story of misplaced love and revenge, features non-professional Aboriginal actors speaking their local language. Gulpilil collaborated with the director, Rolf de Heer, urging him to make the film. He ultimately withdrew from a central role in the project for &quot;complex reasons.&quot; Gulpilil also provided the voice of the storyteller for the film. De Heer had directed Gulpilil in the earlier film, &quot;The Tracker&quot; (2002).

In 2007, he starred in Richard Friar&#x27;s hour-long independent documentary, &quot;Think About It!&quot; This was focused on Indigenous rights and the anti-war movement. It included commentary from former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, former Greens leader Bob Brown, and David Hicks, then a detainee at the United States&#x27; Guantanamo Bay detention camp on Cuba.

In 2014, Gulpilil again collaborated with De Heer, this time sharing on screenwriting credits for &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Country&quot;. The film won several awards, including Best Actor in Un Certain Regard at the Cannes Film Festival.

In 2015, Gulpilil appeared in the documentary &quot;Another Country&quot;, directed by Molly Reynolds. In this film, Gulpilil narrates the story of his life, from when he was a child living on country; the arrival of the first white men (&quot;ghosts&quot;), in the form of missionaries; through The Intervention, and the introduction of the BasicsCard. He often made serious criticisms hidden beneath his trademark humour.

Gulpilil worked again with Reynolds when she directed a documentary about his life, &quot;My Name Is Gulpilil&quot;, which premiered at the 2021 Adelaide Festival.

Gulpilil was renowned for portraying Aboriginal culture before it became threatened by the white civilisations. He became somewhat divorced from his own culture by his career in film. He felt that he was stretched somewhere between the two, with &quot;one tiptoe in champage and caviar, and the other in the dirt of his Dreamtime&quot;.

===Stage===

In March 2004, he performed in the autobiographical stage production, &quot;Gulpilil&quot; at the Adelaide Festival of Arts, and received standing ovations. This work, co-written with Reg Cribb, and directed by Neil Armfield, was based on stories of his life assembled into a script. These included tales from the making of &quot;Walkabout&quot;, performing at Buckingham Palace, and inadvertently causing a bomb scare at Cannes. The show was later staged in Brisbane and Sydney.

He also performed on stage in &quot;The Cradle of Hercules&quot; at the Sydney Opera House in 1974; the Commonwealth Gala Performance in Brisbane in 1982 (in front of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip;) and the Message Sticks Film Festival in Sydney in 2002.

===Dance===
Perhaps the most renowned traditional dancer in Australia, Gulpilil organised troupes of dancers and musicians and performed at festivals throughout the country. He won the prestigious Darwin Australia Day Eisteddfod dance competition four times. 

In November 1997, Gulipilil&#x27;s dance troupe performed at the second National Aboriginal Dance Conference in Adelaide (hosted by the National Aboriginal Dance Council Australia (NADCA).) The conference included discussions of cultural and intellectual property rights and copyright issues for Australian Indigenous dancers. A free concert was given in Rymill Park / Murlawirrapurka. The troupe was given a grant from the Northern Territory Government to attend the third conference in Sydney in 1999.
===Writing and painting===
In addition to his career in dance, music, film and television, Gulpilil was an acclaimed storyteller. He wrote the text for two volumes of children&#x27;s stories based on Yolngu beliefs. These books also feature photographs and drawings by Australian artists, and convey Gulpilil&#x27;s reverence for the landscape, people and traditional culture of his homeland.

&quot;King brown snake with blue tongue lizard at Gulparil waterhole&quot;, painted by Gulpilil in 2013–14, is in the Art Gallery of South Australia&#x27;s collection.

==Recognition and awards==
Gulpilil was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1987, and the Centenary Medal in 2001.

He twice received the AACTA/AFI Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, for &quot;The Tracker&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Country&quot; in 2014. He was also nominated for this award in 1977 for &quot;Storm Boy&quot;. Gulpilil was nominated for the AFI Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; in 2002. In 2003, he was awarded the inaugural Don Dunstan Award at the Adelaide Film Festival.

He was nominated for the Helpmann Award for Best Male Actor in a Play in 2004 for the stage production &quot;Gulpilil&quot;. A portrait of Gulpilil by Craig Ruddy won the 2004 Archibald Prize, Australia&#x27;s best-known art prize.

In 2013 Gulpilil was the recipient of the Red Ochre Award, which is awarded annually by the Australia Council for the Arts to an outstanding Indigenous Australian (Aboriginal Australian or Torres Strait Islander) artist for lifetime achievement.

In May 2014, Gulpilil won a Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival for his performance in Rolf de Heer&#x27;s film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Country&quot;. The award was in the Un Certain Regard section, a part of the festival that emphasises original, individual points of view and innovative film-making.

In 2019, Gulpilil was honoured with the lifetime achievement award at the 2019 NAIDOC Awards, and the Premier&#x27;s Award for Lifetime Achievement in the South Australian Ruby Awards.

In June 2021, Ngarrindjeri-Arrernte artist Thomas Readett created a huge permanent mural on the eastern wall of the Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute in Adelaide. Featuring hand-painted black-and-white images representing Gulpilil&#x27;s early career and later life, the mural was commissioned by ABCG Film, in partnership with Tandanya, Arts South Australia, Department of the Premier and Cabinet and Screen Australia.

During the Vision Splendid Outback Film Festival at Winton, Queensland in June 2021, Gulpilil was honoured with a star on Winton&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

In August 2021, Tandanya mounted an exhibition entitled &quot;Djungi Gulpilil&quot; (Gulpilil family), featuring the work of many artists in his family, including his twin sister, one of his wives and his brother, as well as his own paintings. The exhibition was expressly created to honour and celebrate his life, and to bring him comfort as he is being treated a long way from home, yearning for &quot;culture, language and kin&quot;.

At the 11th AACTA Awards, to be held on 8 December 2021, Gulpilil will be officially awarded the Longford Lyell Award for his contribution to the Australian film industry; he had informally received the award at his home a month earlier. His face will be projected onto the Sydney Opera House in the evening of the award ceremony.

== Later life and death ==
Gulpilil was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in 2017, and retired from acting in 2019. His illness prevented him from attending the 2019 NAIDOC Awards, where he was recognised with the lifetime achievement award.

Gulpilil died at his home in Murray Bridge, South Australia, on 29 November 2021. Following his death, his family requested that he be referred to as David Dalaithngu for a period of time to avoid naming the dead, and many news articles about his death refrained from using the actor&#x27;s professional name, while warning that the articles contained his name and image.

Tributes were published in Australia by political leaders, including Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt, federal opposition leader Anthony Albanese, and South Australian premier Steven Marshall; actors, including Hugh Jackman; film critics; and community elders and relatives, including Witiyana Marika. Overseas news outlets also published lengthy tributes and obituaries.

On 2 December 2021, a statement was posted by Tandanya on Facebook on behalf of the Yolngu community and Gulpilil&#x27;s kin:
The announcement was also reported in newspapers.

==Personal life and family==
Gulpilil suffered from alcoholism, having been introduced to grog during filming of &quot;Walkabout&quot;. In later life, it led to several clashes with the law. In 2006, Gulpilil was charged with carrying an offensive weapon after an altercation at the house of a friend in Darwin, when Gulpilil had allegedly armed himself with a machete after he and his wife had been asked to leave the home by the homeowners, who had allegedly armed themselves with a totem pole and a garden hoe. However, he was found not guilty after the judge accepted that the machete was used for cultural purposes, including carving didgeridoos, and had not been intended for use as a weapon.

On 30 March 2007, a Darwin magistrate imposed a 12-month domestic violence order on Gulpilil over an incident which had involved his wife, Miriam Ashley, on 28 December 2006; Gulpilil was ordered to stay away from her while drinking. In December 2010, Gulpilil was charged with aggravated assault against Ashley, with the court hearing that he had thrown a broom at her, fracturing her arm. In September 2011, he was found guilty and sentenced to twelve months in Berrimah Prison in Darwin. After this stint in prison, he finally got sober.

Gulpilil&#x27;s other wives or partners included Airlie Thomas and Robyn Djunginy. Two of his daughters are Phoebe Marson and Makia McLaughlin. Seven children survived him: Jida (a musician and actor), Milan, Makia, Andrew, Jamie, Phoebe and Malakai. Witiyana Marika, Yolngu elder, musician and band member of Yothu Yindi, is his son by lore.

Several members of his family are artists, including his twin sister (&quot;yapa&quot;), Mary Dhalapany, a leading weaver; his brother, Peter Minygululu, known for his story-telling and detailed artworks; and former wife Robyn Djunginy, who was known for her bottle paintings. His nephew (&quot;waku&quot;), Bobby Bununggurr, is a singer, dancer, law man and reconciliation advocate. During the 1970s and 1980s, the two men travelled widely together, performing, dancing, and singing.

<text>A Million Open Doors (1992) is a science fiction novel by American writer John Barnes, the first book of his &quot;Thousand Cultures&quot; series. The story is told from the perspective of a maturing adult from a parochial culture who encounters many obstacles in a different and even more parochial culture which causes him to become a fully engaged citizen in the Interstellar culture. &quot;A Million Open Doors&quot; is a study of the effects of globalization.

The novel was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1992 and the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1994.

==Plot summary==
The story begins sometime in the 29th century on the planet Wilson (orbiting Arcturus) with a young man named Giraut and his romantic, swashbuckling friends, who are all members of the Nou Occitan culture and residents in the Quartier de Jovents, a sort of playground for teens and twenty-somethings who have not yet moved on to the more &quot;grown-up&quot; lifestyle of their parents. 
Technologically safeguarded, these young adults have swordfights in the streets with &quot;neuroducer&quot; épées and frequent the taverns of the Quartier, living in an imaginative recreation of Occitan literature and the &quot;trobador&quot; tradition.

However, Giraut is forced to grow up much more quickly than most of his friends, because one day his friend Aimeric, who was, before coming to Wilson and becoming a &quot;jovent&quot;, an economist in the Caledon culture of the nearest inhabited planet, Nansen (orbiting Mufrid), is called upon by the government to return to his home planet on a mission to regulate the effects of the springer on Caledonian economy. The springer is a method of instantaneous transportation which is quickly reuniting humanity across known space.

Giraut decides to leave when he catches his girlfriend getting into the Interstellar &quot;arts scene&quot; (the art is called &quot;sadoporn&quot;) which is an acting out against the exclusive values and code of honor valued by Giraut and his friends. Thus, Aimeric and Giraut advise the rational council of the Caledonians to adjust their economy to that of the rest of the universe so that the springer will have as few adverse effects as possible.

When the Caledonians decide that Aimeric and Giraut, as well as the Interstellar government, are trying to usurp their power, they begin to try to seize back control of everything, and an urban conflict ensues. Giraut discovers among the strife who he really is and begins to see how fake his life back home was, and recognize faults in his home culture.

==Literary significance &amp; criticism==
In her review at tor.com, Jo Walton called the book a &quot;wonderful immersive science fiction novel,&quot; and wrote that &quot;this is perhaps his best book.&quot;

<doc id="1248082" wikidata="Q3959778" url="?curid=1248082" title="Showtime (The J. Geils Band album)">
<text>Showtime! is the third and final live album by American rock band The J. Geils Band during their career. It was recorded at the Pine Knob Music Theater in Clarkston, Michigan on September 4, 1982. While some critics consider it to be weaker than the group&#x27;s two earlier live albums &quot;&quot;Live&quot; Full House&quot; (1972) and &quot;Blow Your Face Out&quot; (1976), this release captures the band at its commercial peak. The tracks are drawn primarily from the four studio albums released since &quot;Blow Your Face Out:&quot; &quot;Monkey Island&quot; (1977); &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (1978); &quot;Love Stinks&quot; (1980); and &quot;Freeze Frame&quot; (1981). This was the last release by the band before frontman Peter Wolf&#x27;s departure in 1983.

<doc id="1248100" wikidata="Q421651" url="?curid=1248100" title="BRCA2">
<text>BRCA2 and BRCA2 () are human genes and their protein products, respectively. The official symbol (BRCA2, italic for the gene, nonitalic for the protein) and the official name (originally breast cancer 2; currently BRCA2, DNA repair associated) are maintained by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee. One alternative symbol, FANCD1, recognizes its association with the FANC protein complex. Orthologs, styled &quot;Brca2&quot; and Brca2, are common in other vertebrate species. &quot;BRCA2&quot; is a human tumor suppressor gene (specifically, a caretaker gene), found in all humans; its protein, also called by the synonym breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein, is responsible for repairing DNA.

&quot;BRCA2&quot; and &quot;BRCA1&quot; are normally expressed in the cells of breast and other tissue, where they help repair damaged DNA or destroy cells if DNA cannot be repaired. They are involved in the repair of chromosomal damage with an important role in the error-free repair of DNA double strand breaks. If &quot;BRCA1&quot; or &quot;BRCA2&quot; itself is damaged by a &quot;BRCA&quot; mutation, damaged DNA is not repaired properly, and this increases the risk for breast cancer. &quot;BRCA1&quot; and &quot;BRCA2&quot; have been described as &quot;breast cancer susceptibility genes&quot; and &quot;breast cancer susceptibility proteins&quot;. The predominant allele has a normal tumor suppressive function whereas high penetrance mutations in these genes cause a loss of tumor suppressive function, which correlates with an increased risk of breast cancer.

The &quot;BRCA2&quot; gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 13 at position 12.3 (13q12.3). The human reference &quot;BRCA2&quot; gene contains 27 exons, and the cDNA has 10,254 base pairs coding for a protein of 3418 amino acids.

== Function ==
Although the structures of the &quot;BRCA1&quot; and &quot;BRCA2&quot; genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate and maintain strand invasion, a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of the BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks can be caused by natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.

BRCA2 has been shown to possess a crucial role in protection from the MRE11-dependent nucleolytic degradation of the reversed forks that are forming during DNA replication fork stalling (caused by obstacles such as mutations, intercalating agents etc.).

Like BRCA1, BRCA2 probably regulates the activity of other genes and plays a critical role in embryo development.

== Clinical significance ==
Certain variations of the &quot;BRCA2&quot; gene increase risks for breast cancer as part of a hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome. Researchers have identified hundreds of mutations in the &quot;BRCA2&quot; gene, many of which cause an increased risk of cancer. &quot;BRCA2&quot; mutations are usually insertions or deletions of a small number of DNA base pairs in the gene. As a result of these mutations, the protein product of the &quot;BRCA2&quot; gene is abnormal, and does not function properly. Researchers believe that the defective &quot;BRCA2&quot; protein is unable to fix DNA damage that occurs throughout the genome. As a result, there is an increase in mutations due to error-prone translesion synthesis past un-repaired DNA damage, and some of these mutations can cause cells to divide in an uncontrolled way and form a tumor.

People who have two mutated copies of the &quot;BRCA2&quot; gene have one type of Fanconi anemia. This condition is caused by extremely reduced levels of the BRCA2 protein in cells, which allows the accumulation of damaged DNA. Patients with Fanconi anemia are prone to several types of leukemia (a type of blood cell cancer); solid tumors, particularly of the head, neck, skin, and reproductive organs; and bone marrow suppression (reduced blood cell production that leads to anemia). Women having inherited a defective &quot;BRCA1&quot; or &quot;BRCA2&quot; gene have risks for breast and ovarian cancer that are so high and seem so selective that many mutation carriers choose to have prophylactic surgery. There has been much conjecture to explain such apparently striking tissue specificity. Major determinants of where &quot;BRCA1&quot;- and &quot;BRCA2&quot;-associated hereditary cancers occur are related to tissue specificity of the cancer pathogen, the agent that causes chronic inflammation, or the carcinogen. The target tissue may have receptors for the pathogen, become selectively exposed to carcinogens and an infectious process. An innate genomic deficit impairs normal responses and exacerbates the susceptibility to disease in organ targets. This theory also fits data for several tumor suppressors beyond &quot;BRCA1&quot; or &quot;BRCA2&quot;. A major advantage of this model is that it suggests there are some options in addition to prophylactic surgery.

In addition to breast cancer in men and women, mutations in &quot;BRCA2&quot; also lead to an increased risk of ovarian, uterine tube, prostate and pancreatic cancer. In some studies, mutations in the central part of the gene have been associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with &quot;BRCA2&quot; mutations.

In general, strongly inherited gene mutations (including mutations in &quot;BRCA2&quot;) account for only 5-10% of breast cancer cases; the specific risk of getting breast or other cancer for anyone carrying a &quot;BRCA2&quot; mutation depends on many factors.

== History ==
The BRCA2 gene was discovered in 1994 by a multi-institutional team of scientists, led by researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research, London. In 1996, Kenneth Offit and his research group at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center successfully identified the most common mutation on the gene associated with breast and ovarian cancer among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

The gene was first cloned by scientists at Myriad Genetics, Endo Recherche, Inc., HSC Research &amp; Development Limited Partnership, and the University of Pennsylvania.

Methods to diagnose the likelihood of a patient with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 getting cancer were covered by patents owned or controlled by Myriad Genetics. Myriad&#x27;s business model of exclusively offering the diagnostic test led from Myriad&#x27;s beginnings as a startup in 1994 to its being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high test prices and the unavailability of second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark &quot;Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics&quot; lawsuit.

== Germline mutations and founder effect ==
All germline BRCA2 mutations identified to date have been inherited, suggesting the possibility of a large &quot;founder&quot; effect in which a certain mutation is common to a well-defined population group and can theoretically be traced back to a common ancestor. Given the complexity of mutation screening for BRCA2, these common mutations may simplify the methods required for mutation screening in certain populations. Analysis of mutations that occur with high frequency also permits the study of their clinical expression. A striking example of a founder mutation is found in Iceland, where a single BRCA2 (999del5) mutation accounts for virtually all breast/ovarian cancer families. This frame-shift mutation leads to a highly truncated protein product. In a large study examining hundreds of cancer and control individuals, this 999del5 mutation was found in 0.6% of the general population. Of note, while 72% of patients who were found to be carriers had a moderate or strong family history of breast cancer, 28% had little or no family history of the disease. This strongly suggests the presence of modifying genes that affect the phenotypic expression of this mutation, or possibly the interaction of the BRCA2 mutation with environmental factors. Additional examples of founder mutations in BRCA2 are given in the table below.

==Meiosis==

In the plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, loss of the &quot;BRCA2&quot; homolog &quot;AtBRCA2&quot; causes severe defects in both male meiosis and in the development of the female gametocyte. AtBRCA2 protein is required for proper localization of the synaptonemal complex protein AtZYP1 and the recombinases AtRAD51 and AtDMC1. Furthermore, AtBRCA2 is required for proper meiotic synapsis. Thus AtBRCA2 is likely important for meiotic recombination. It appears that AtBRCA2 acts during meiosis to control the single-strand invasion steps mediated by AtRAD51 and AtDMC1 occurring during meiotic homologous recombinational repair of DNA damages.

Homologs of BRCA2 are also essential for meiosis in the fungus &quot;Ustilago maydis&quot;, the worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, and the fruitfly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;.

Mice that produce truncated versions of BRCA2 are viable but sterile. BRCA2 mutant rats have a phenotype of growth inhibition and sterility in both sexes. Aspermatogenesis in these mutant rats is due to a failure of homologous chromosome synapsis during meiosis.

===BRC repeat sequences===

&quot;DMC1&quot; (DNA meiotic recombinase 1) is a meiosis specific homolog of &quot;RAD51&quot; that mediates strand exchange during homologous recombinational repair. DMC1 promotes the formation of DNA strand invasion products (joint molecules) between homologous DNA molecules. Human DMC1 interacts directly with each of a series of repeat sequences in the BRCA2 protein (called BRC repeats) that stimulate joint molecule formation by DMC1. BRC repeats conform to a motif consisting of a sequence of about 35 highly conserved amino acids that are present at least once in all BRCA2-like proteins. The BRCA2 BRC repeats stimulate joint molecule formation by promoting the interaction of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with DMC1. The ssDNA complexed with DMC1 can pair with homologous ssDNA from another chromosome during the synopsis stage of meiosis to form a joint molecule, a central step in homologous recombination. Thus the BRC repeat sequences of BRCA2 appear to play a key role in recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiotic recombination.

Overall, it appears that homologous recombination during meiosis functions to repair DNA damages, and that BRCA2 plays a key role in performing this function.

==Neurogenesis==

BRCA2 is required in the mouse for neurogenesis and suppression of medulloblastoma. ‘’BRCA2’’ loss profoundly affects neurogenesis, particularly during embryonic and postnatal neural development. These neurological defects arise from DNA damage.

==Epigenetic control==

Epigenetic alterations in expression of BRCA2 (causing over-expression or under-expression) are very frequent in sporadic cancers (see Table below) while mutations in BRCA2 are rarely found.

In non-small cell lung cancer, BRCA2 is epigenetically repressed by hypermethylation of the promoter. In this case, promoter hypermethylation is significantly associated with low mRNA expression and low protein expression but not with loss of heterozygosity of the gene.

In sporadic ovarian cancer, an opposite effect is found. BRCA2 promoter and 5&#x27;-UTR regions have relatively few or no methylated CpG dinucleotides in the tumor DNA compared with that of non-tumor DNA, and a significant correlation is found between hypomethylation and a &gt;3-fold over-expression of BRCA2. This indicates that hypomethylation of the BRCA2 promoter and 5&#x27;-UTR regions leads to over-expression of BRCA2 mRNA.

One report indicated some epigenetic control of BRCA2 expression by the microRNAs miR-146a and miR-148a.

==BRCA2 expression in cancer==

In eukaryotes, BRCA2 protein has an important role in homologous recombinational repair. In mice and humans, BRCA2 primarily mediates orderly assembly of RAD51 on single-stranded (ss) DNA, the form that is active for homologous pairing and strand invasion. BRCA2 also redirects RAD51 from double-stranded DNA and prevents dissociation from ssDNA. In addition, the four paralogs of RAD51, consisting of RAD51B (RAD51L1), RAD51C (RAD51L2), RAD51D (RAD51L3), XRCC2 form a complex called the BCDX2 complex (see Figure: Recombinational repair of DNA). This complex participates in RAD51 recruitment or stabilization at damage sites. The BCDX2 complex appears to act by facilitating the assembly or stability of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament. RAD51 catalyses strand transfer between a broken sequence and its undamaged homologue to allow re-synthesis of the damaged region (see homologous recombination models).

Some studies of cancers report over-expressed &quot;BRCA2&quot; whereas other studies report under-expression of &quot;BRCA2&quot;. At least two reports found over-expression in some sporadic breast tumors and under-expression in other sporadic breast tumors. (see Table).

Many cancers have epigenetic deficiencies in various DNA repair genes (see Frequencies of epimutations in DNA repair genes in cancers). These repair deficiencies likely cause increased unrepaired DNA damages. The over-expression of &quot;BRCA2&quot; seen in many cancers may reflect compensatory &quot;BRCA2&quot; over-expression and increased homologous recombinational repair to at least partially deal with such excess DNA damages. Egawa et al. suggest that increased expression of BRCA2 can be explained by the genomic instability frequently seen in cancers, which induces BRCA2 mRNA expression due to an increased need for BRCA2 for DNA repair.

Under-expression of &quot;BRCA2&quot; would itself lead to increased unrepaired DNA damages. Replication errors past these damages (see translesion synthesis) would lead to increased mutations and cancer.

== Domain architecture ==
BRCA2 contains a number of 39 amino acid repeats that are critical for binding to RAD51 (a key protein in DNA recombinational repair) and resistance to methyl methanesulphonate treatment.

The BRCA2 helical domain adopts a helical structure, consisting of a four-helix cluster core (alpha 1, alpha 8, alpha 9, alpha 10) and two successive beta-hairpins (beta 1 to beta 4). An approximately 50-amino acid segment that contains four short helices (alpha 2 to alpha 4), meanders around the surface of the core structure. In BRCA2, the alpha 9 and alpha 10 helices pack with the BRCA2 OB1 domain through van der Waals contacts involving hydrophobic and aromatic residues, and also through side-chain and backbone hydrogen bonds. This domain binds the 70-amino acid DSS1 (deleted in split-hand/split foot syndrome) protein, which was originally identified as one of three genes that map to a 1.5-Mb locus deleted in an inherited developmental malformation syndrome.

The BRCA OB1 domain assumes an OB fold, which consists of a highly curved five-stranded beta-sheet that closes on itself to form a beta-barrel. OB1 has a shallow groove formed by one face of the curved sheet and is demarcated by two loops, one between beta 1 and beta 2 and another between beta 4 and beta 5, which allows for weak single strand DNA binding. The domain also binds the 70-amino acid DSS1 (deleted in split-hand/split foot syndrome) protein.

The BRCA OB3 domain assumes an OB fold, which consists of a highly curved five-stranded beta-sheet that closes on itself to form a beta-barrel. OB3 has a pronounced groove formed by one face of the curved sheet and is demarcated by two loops, one between beta 1 and beta 2 and another between beta 4 and beta 5, which allows for strong ssDNA binding.

The Tower domain adopts a secondary structure consisting of a pair of long, antiparallel alpha-helices (the stem) that support a three-helix bundle (3HB) at their end. The 3HB contains a helix-turn-helix motif and is similar to the DNA binding domains of the bacterial site-specific recombinases, and of eukaryotic Myb and homeodomain transcription factors. The Tower domain has an important role in the tumour suppressor function of BRCA2, and is essential for appropriate binding of BRCA2 to DNA. Studies shown that conformation of this tower domain is allosterically controlled by a small protein &quot;DSS1&quot;, which interacts with helical, OB1 and OB2 domains of BRCA2.

==Patents, enforcement, litigation, and controversy==
A patent application for the isolated BRCA1 gene and cancer-cancer promoting mutations, as well as methods to diagnose the likelihood of getting breast cancer, was filed by the University of Utah, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and Myriad Genetics in 1994; over the next year, Myriad, in collaboration with other investigators, isolated and sequenced the BRCA2 gene and identified relevant mutations, and the first BRCA2 patent was filed in the U.S. by Myriad and the other institutions in 1995. Myriad is the exclusive licensee of these patents and has enforced them in the US against clinical diagnostic labs. This business model led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to get second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics lawsuit. The patents begin to expire in 2014.

Peter Meldrum, CEO of Myriad Genetics, has acknowledged that Myriad has &quot;other competitive advantages that may make such [patent] enforcement unnecessary&quot; in Europe.

Legal decisions surrounding the BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents will affect the field of genetic testing in general. In June 2013, in &quot;Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics&quot; (No. 12-398), the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that, &quot;A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated,&quot; invalidating Myriad&#x27;s patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, the Court also held that manipulation of a gene to create something not found in nature could still be eligible for patent protection. The Federal Court of Australia came to the opposite conclusion, upholding the validity of an Australian Myriad Genetics patent over the BRCA1 gene in February 2013, but this decision is being appealed and the appeal will include consideration of the US Supreme Court ruling.

<doc id="1248103" wikidata="Q889867" url="?curid=1248103" title="Fairytale of New York">
<text>&quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; is a song written by Jem Finer and Shane MacGowan and recorded by their London-based band the Pogues, featuring English singer-songwriter Kirsty MacColl on vocals. The song is an Irish folk-style ballad and was written as a duet, with the Pogues&#x27; singer MacGowan taking the role of the male character and MacColl playing the female character. It was originally released as a single on 23 November 1987 and later featured on the Pogues&#x27; 1988 album &quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot;.

Originally begun in 1985, the song had a troubled two-year development history, undergoing rewrites and aborted attempts at recording, and losing its original female vocalist along the way, before finally being completed in August 1987. Although the single has never been the UK Christmas number one, being kept at number two on its original release in 1987 by the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; cover of &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;, it has proved enduringly popular with both music critics and the public: to date, the song has reached the UK Top 20 on twenty separate occasions since its original release in 1987, including every year at Christmas since 2005. As of September 2017, it had sold 1.2 million copies in the UK, with an additional 249,626 streaming equivalent sales, for a total of 1.5 million combined sales. In December 2023, the song was certified sextuple platinum in the UK for 3.6 million combined sales.

In the UK, &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; is the most-played Christmas song of the 21st century. It is frequently cited as the best Christmas song of all time in various television, radio, and magazine-related polls in the UK and Ireland, including the UK television special on ITV in December 2012 where it was voted &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite Christmas Song&quot;.

==Background and song development==
Although there is agreement among the band that &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; was first written in 1985, the origins of the song are disputed. MacGowan insisted that it arose as a result of a wager made by the Pogues&#x27; producer at the time, Elvis Costello, that the band would not be able to write a Christmas hit single, while the Pogues&#x27; manager Frank Murray has stated that it was originally his idea that the band should try to write a Christmas song as he thought it would be &quot;interesting&quot;. Banjo player Finer came up with the melody and the original concept for the song, which was set in County Clare on Ireland&#x27;s west coast, involving a sailor in New York looking out over the ocean and reminiscing about being back home in Ireland. Finer&#x27;s wife Marcia did not like the original seafaring story, and suggested new lyrics regarding a conversation between a couple at Christmas. Finer told &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;I had written two songs complete with tunes, one had a good tune and crap lyrics, the other had the idea for &#x27;Fairytale&#x27; but the tune was poxy, I gave them both to Shane and he gave it a Broadway melody, and there it was&quot;.

The song&#x27;s title, the musical structure, and its lyrical theme of a conversation between a couple were in place by the end of 1985, and were described by MacGowan in an interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in its 1985 Christmas issue:
MacGowan had decided to name the song after J. P. Donleavy&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;A Fairy Tale of New York&quot;, which Finer was reading at the time and had left lying around the recording studio. In the same &quot;Melody Maker&quot; interview, MacGowan expressed regret that the song had not been completed in time to be released for Christmas that year and hinted that the track would appear on an EP that the Pogues were due to record shortly. In January 1986, the group recorded the song during the sessions with Costello that would produce the &quot;Poguetry in Motion&quot; EP, with bass player Cait O&#x27;Riordan singing the female part. Costello suggested naming the song &quot;Christmas Eve in the Drunk Tank&quot;, after the song&#x27;s opening lines, but the band were scornful of Costello&#x27;s suggestion, with MacGowan pointing out to Costello that a song with such a title was unlikely to be favourably received and played by radio stations. The majority of the lyrics had been written while MacGowan was recovering in a bed in Malmö after being struck down with double pneumonia during a Pogues tour of Scandinavia in late 1985 – he later said, &quot;you get a lot of delirium and stuff, so I got quite a few good images out of that&quot;. However, despite several attempts at recording it, the group were unhappy with the results and the song was temporarily put aside, to be returned to at a later date. Guitarist Philip Chevron later said, &quot;It was not quite there. It needed to have a full-on, confident performance from the band, which it lacked.&quot; The producer of the final version, Steve Lillywhite, diplomatically described the version recorded with O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s vocals as not &quot;fully realised&quot;. Extracts from these earlier versions of the song are included on the 2008 box set &quot;Just Look Them Straight in the Eye and Say... POGUEMAHONE!!&quot;.

In March 1986, the Pogues toured the US for the first time. The opening date of the tour was in New York City, a place which had long fascinated MacGowan and which inspired him to write new lyrics for the song. Among the members of the city&#x27;s Irish-American community who saw the show and visited the band backstage after the concert were film-maker Peter Dougherty and actor Matt Dillon: both later became friends with the Pogues and played important roles in the video for &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;. Another inspiration was Sergio Leone&#x27;s film &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, which MacGowan and whistle player Spider Stacy watched over and over again in the tour bus. Apart from shaping the ideas for the lyrics, MacGowan wrote a slow, piano-based introduction to &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; influenced by the film&#x27;s score by Ennio Morricone; the intro was later edited together with the more upbeat original melody to create the final song.

As 1986 went on, the Pogues encountered various problems that brought a halt to their recording activity. Their record label Stiff ran into financial difficulties and went into administration, although as the label still owned the rights to the Pogues&#x27; recordings this meant that a distribution deal had to be negotiated with a new label to release any new Pogues material. The group&#x27;s deteriorating relationship with Costello saw them part ways with their producer, and, after increasingly erratic behaviour, Cait O&#x27;Riordan, who had become romantically involved with Costello, left the band in October 1986. The departure of O&#x27;Riordan meant the song had now lost its intended female singer.

==Recording==

The problems at Stiff were eventually resolved, and the Pogues were finally able to enter a recording studio again in early 1987 to start work on their third album, now with Steve Lillywhite producing. A new demo of &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; was recorded at London&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios in March 1987, with MacGowan singing both the male and female roles. However, it was not until the third set of recording sessions in August 1987 in nearby RAK Studios that it was suggested that Lillywhite take the track back to his home studio and let his wife Kirsty MacColl lay down a new guide vocal for the song. Having worked on her vocals meticulously, Lillywhite brought the recording back to the studio where the Pogues were impressed with MacColl&#x27;s singing and realised she would be the ideal voice for the female character in the song.

MacGowan later said, &quot;Kirsty knew exactly the right measure of viciousness and femininity and romance to put into it and she had a very strong character and it came across in a big way... In operas, if you have a double aria, it&#x27;s what the woman does that really matters. The man lies, the woman tells the truth.&quot; MacGowan re-recorded his vocals alongside the tape of MacColl&#x27;s contribution (the duo never recorded the song together in the studio) and the song was duly completed with the addition of a harp played by Siobhan Sheahan and horns and a string section. The French horns and strings were recorded at Townhouse Studios on the last day of recording &quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot;, arranged by Fiachra Trench after band member James Fearnley had mocked up an arrangement on a keyboard.

Reflecting on the recording of the song during a 2020 interview, MacGowan said &quot;it was a happy time for the group. It&#x27;s our Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. He paid tribute to MacColl for lending her vocals to the song: &quot;I was very grateful to Kirsty. I don&#x27;t think it would have been such a big hit without her contribution.&quot;

==Composition==
The song follows an Irish immigrant&#x27;s Christmas Eve reverie about holidays past while sleeping off a binge in a New York City drunk tank. When an inebriated old man also in the cell sings a passage from the Irish ballad &quot;The Rare Old Mountain Dew&quot;, the narrator (MacGowan) begins to dream of a former lover. The remainder of the song (which may be an internal monologue) takes the form of a call and response between the couple, their youthful hopes crushed by alcoholism and drug addiction, as they reminisce and bicker on Christmas Eve. The phrases &quot;Sinatra was swinging&quot; and &quot;cars big as bars&quot; seem to place the song in the late 1940s, although the music video clearly depicts a contemporary 1980s New York. On the impact of the lyrics, Helen Brown of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; writes,

==Music video==

The video for the song was directed by Peter Dougherty and filmed in New York during a bitterly cold week in November 1987. The video opens with MacGowan sitting at a piano as if playing the song&#x27;s opening refrain: however, as MacGowan could not actually play the instrument, the close-up shot featured the hands of the band&#x27;s pianist Fearnley wearing MacGowan&#x27;s rings on his fingers. Fearnley later said that he found the experience &quot;humiliating&quot; but accepted the idea that it looked better in the video to show MacGowan seated at the piano.

Part of the video was filmed inside a real police station on the Lower East Side. Actor Matt Dillon plays a police officer who arrests MacGowan and takes him to the cells. Dillon recalled that he had been afraid to handle MacGowan roughly, and had to be encouraged by Dougherty and MacGowan to use force. MacGowan and the rest of the band were drinking throughout the shoot, and the police became concerned about their increasingly rowdy behaviour in the cells. Dillon, who was sober, had to intervene and reassure the police that there would be no problems.

The chorus of the song includes the line &quot;The boys of the NYPD choir still singing &#x27;Galway Bay&#x27;&quot;. In reality, the NYPD (New York City Police Department) does not have a choir, the closest thing being the NYPD Pipes and Drums who are featured in the video for the song. The NYPD Pipes and Drums did not know &quot;Galway Bay&quot; and so sang a song that all of them knew the words to – the &quot;Mickey Mouse March&quot;, the theme tune for &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; television series. The footage was then slowed down and shown in brief sections to disguise the fact the Pipes and Drums were singing a different song. Murray recalled that the Pipes and Drums had been drinking on the coach that brought them to the video shoot, and by the time they arrived they were more drunk than the band, refusing to work unless they were supplied with more alcohol.

==Critical reception==
The song received widepread praise from the UK music press. In &quot;Sounds&quot;, Neil Perry awarded it &quot;Single of the Week&quot; and observed, &quot;In fine MacGowan tradition it&#x27;s not long before the insults are flying, still carried innocently along by the magical – and unforgettable – melody.&quot; Lysette Cohen of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; also made the record one of the magazine&#x27;s Singles of the Week, calling it &quot;the most wonderful Christmas record ever&quot; and &quot;staggering and drunkenly inspirational&quot;. In &quot;NME&quot;, James Brown said that &quot;The Pogues excel themselves and release a record worthy of the Christmas no. 1 spot&quot;, concluding that the band &quot;have claimed the art of the ballad to be their own – on the strength of &#x27;New York&#x27; they deserve it&quot;. Andy Darling of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; stated that he was turned off by the idea that drinking was a prerequisite for artistic genius, but that &quot;this [song] makes up for a lot though&quot;.

==Lyrical controversy and editing==

The song&#x27;s lyrical content attracted attention from the start due to language contained in its second verse, where MacGowan&#x27;s character refers to MacColl&#x27;s character as &quot;an old slut on junk&quot;, to which MacColl responds with a tirade that includes the words &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;arse&quot;. When the song was performed on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on its initial release, the BBC requested that MacColl&#x27;s singing of &quot;arse&quot; be replaced with the perceived-less-offensive &quot;ass&quot;. During a live performance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in January 1992, MacColl changed the lyric further, singing &quot;You&#x27;re cheap and you&#x27;re haggard&quot;. When Katie Melua performed the song with the Pogues on &quot;&quot; in December 2005, ITV censored the word &quot;arse&quot;, but left &quot;faggot&quot; uncensored.

On 18 December 2007, BBC Radio 1 edited the words &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;slut&quot; from the track to &quot;avoid offence&quot;. MacColl&#x27;s mother described the ban as &quot;too ridiculous&quot;, while the Pogues said they found it &quot;amusing&quot;. The BBC stated, &quot;We are playing an edited version because some members of the audience might find it offensive&quot;. The BBC later announced they had reversed their decision and continued to play the song uncensored. Other BBC radio stations, including the traditionally more conservative Radio 2, had continued to play the original version throughout this period, the ban having applied to Radio 1 only. The MTV channels in the UK also removed and scrambled the words &quot;slut&quot;, &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;arse&quot; from the song.

In December 2018, two broadcasters on Ireland&#x27;s RTÉ 2fm pop music station caused controversy by asking for the word &quot;faggot&quot; to be bleeped from broadcasts of the song. RTÉ announced they would not censor the lyric. Some days later, MacGowan defended the lyrics in a statement released to Virgin Media Television&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;:
The word was used by the character because it fitted with the way she would speak and with her character. She is not supposed to be a nice person, or even a wholesome person. She is a woman of a certain generation at a certain time in history and she is down on her luck and desperate. Her dialogue is as accurate as I could make it but she is not intended to offend! She is just supposed to be an authentic character and not all characters in songs and stories are angels or even decent and respectable, sometimes characters in songs and stories have to be evil or nasty to tell the story effectively. If people don&#x27;t understand that I was trying to accurately portray the character as authentically as possible, then I am absolutely fine with them bleeping the word, but I don&#x27;t want to get into an argument.

In December 2019, BBC Radio Solent radio presenter Alex Dyke announced on his Twitter account that he would not be playing &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; on his show, calling it a &quot;nasty, nasty song&quot; and &quot;an offensive pile of downmarket chav bilge&quot;. Other journalists have also criticised the song&#x27;s lyrics.

In November 2020, the BBC again announced that Radio 1 would play a censored version with the words &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;slut&quot; removed, while Radio 2 would play the original, and 6 Music presenters would each decide for themselves which version to play. In response musician Nick Cave accused the BBC of &quot;mutilating&quot; the song, stating it would be &quot;stripped of its value&quot;. However, since 2022 Radio 2 have played the radio edit supplied by the record company with the word &quot;slut&quot; muted and &quot;You cheap lousy faggot&quot; rephrased to &quot;You&#x27;re cheap and you&#x27;re haggard&quot;. On 2 December 2023, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that the UK&#x27;s Boom Radio would play the uncensored version of &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; after 91% of listeners who responded to a poll said they would not be offended by the lyrics.

==Releases and promotion==

The song was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland in November 1987 and swiftly became a hit, spending five weeks at Number 1 in the Irish charts. On 17 December 1987, the Pogues and MacColl performed the song on the BBC&#x27;s television show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and it was propelled to number two on the official UK Top 75. Although the song finished 1987 as the 48th best seller of the year despite only a month&#x27;s sales, it was denied the UK Christmas number one by the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; synth-pop version of &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;. MacGowan was reported to have said &quot;We were beaten by two queens and a drum machine&quot;. MacColl later said that she did not feel they were really in competition with the Pet Shop Boys as they were doing a completely different type of music.

The song was re-released by the Pogues in the UK in 1991 (reaching No. 36), and again in the UK and Ireland for Christmas 2005, reaching number three in the UK. All proceeds from the latter release were donated towards a mixture of homeless charities and &quot;Justice for Kirsty&quot;, a campaign to find out the truth behind MacColl&#x27;s death in 2000. Due to the eligibility of downloads to chart even without a physical release, coupled with a more recent further boost from streaming data, the song has re-entered the Top 75 every December since 2005. It has now made the Top 20 on twenty separate occasions including nineteen times in successive years, and the Top 10 on eleven separate occasions including individual runs of three and seven successive years, feats that no other single can match. Its 21 visits to the chart to date now total 118 weeks on the official UK Top 75 (as of w/e 4 January 2024), making it the fifth most charted song of all time. In late 2012 it was declared a UK million-seller. The song is considerably less well known in the US.

On hearing the song following the vocalist MacColl&#x27;s death in 2000, MacGowan stated &quot;for a while it used to depress me. But now I just think it&#x27;s a tribute to Kirsty.&quot; On 22 December 2005, the Pogues performed the song on a &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; Christmas special on BBC One, with the female vocals taken by singer Katie Melua.

Following MacGowan&#x27;s death in 2023, the song returned to No 1 in the Irish Singles Chart, on the same day as MacGowan&#x27;s funeral and 36 years after it first topped the charts in Ireland. On 13 December 2023, The Pogues reissued the song as a charity 7-inch single in tribute to MacGowan and to benefit the Dublin Simon Community, an organization fighting homelessness, that MacGowan supported.

==Legacy==

&quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; was announced as &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite Christmas Song&quot; in a 90-minute special on ITV on 22 December 2012, following a UK-wide survey of ITV viewers. In the UK it is the most-played Christmas song of the 21st century. The song has featured in many UK and Ireland-based surveys and polls:
* Number 1 in the VH1 greatest Christmas song chart three years running, in 2004, 2005, and 2006.
* Number 11 in Channel 4&#x27;s 100 Greatest Christmas Moments.
* Number 27 on VH1&#x27;s Greatest Songs Never to Make Number One.
* Number 23 on VH1&#x27;s greatest lyrics.
* Number 96 in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs Of All Time.
* Number 84 on BBC Radio 2&#x27;s top 100 greatest songs of all time poll.
* Number 204 in &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.
* The Music Factory poll in December 2008 which found that the song was the favourite Christmas song.
* The UK&#x27;s second-favourite single to have missed the number 1 slot.
* RTÉ 2fm listeners voted it second on The Ultimate Irish Playlist.
* Topped a blinkbox poll for the UK&#x27;s favourite Christmas song, with the 1980s also voted the best decade for Christmas music (the other 1980s songs in the top 10 were Wham!&#x27;s &quot;Last Christmas&quot;, Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; and Chris Rea&#x27;s &quot;Driving Home for Christmas&quot;).

In topping another UK poll in December 2014, &quot;The Independent&quot; states, &quot;The poll is the latest in a number of surveys that has named &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; the nation&#x27;s favourite Christmas song.&quot; The song was the subject of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Soul Music&quot; series on 22 December 2015.

According to analysis of PRS for Music figures, it was estimated that the song generates £400,000 of royalties per year.

==Other versions==
The song was covered by American singer Jon Bon Jovi in 2020 as part of a three-track EP, &quot;A Jon Bon Jovi Christmas&quot;, and features re-written lyrics as well as Bon Jovi singing both vocal parts. The version was widely panned by both critics and fans, and labelled one of the worst songs of 2020 by several publications. Irish musician Rob Smith said: &quot;I have heard Bon Jovi&#x27;s cover of Fairytale of New York. It&#x27;s the worst thing to ever happen to music, and I am including both the murder of John Lennon and Brian McFadden&#x27;s solo career in there. This is worse!&quot; The Pogues&#x27; Twitter account retweeted the post, adding &quot;What Rob said&quot;. Steve Lillywhite, producer of the original track, additionally wrote, &quot;The worst ever version of this song. Sorry Jon... embarrassing and pointless&quot;. However, MacGowan reportedly enjoyed the &quot;interesting and soulful&quot; cover, according to a tweet from his wife Victoria Mary Clarke.

In 1999, punk rock band No Use for a Name covered the song for their 1999 album &quot;More Betterness!&quot;, with Cinder Block, the lead singer of the punk rock band Tilt, performing MacColl&#x27;s parts. AllMusic reviewer Mike DaRonco complimented the band&#x27;s &quot;abrasive&quot; cover of the song. 

In November 2023, NFL players and brothers Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce covered the song as &quot;Fairytale of Philadelphia&quot; for the charity album &quot;A Philly Special Christmas&quot;, raising money for the Children&#x27;s Crisis Treatment Center and Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia. The Kelce brothers&#x27; version adjusts the lyrics by moving the story to Philadelphia and changing the plot from a romantic relationship to one between brothers and rivals, in addition to choosing more creative insults. 

Following MacGowan&#x27;s death on 30 November 2023, Glen Hansard and Lisa O&#x27;Neill performed the song at his funeral.

Hozier covered the song during his December 2024 appearance on Saturday Night Live. His rendition included changes to the first and third lines of the song&#x27;s controversial third verse, which respectively became &quot;You&#x27;re a bum, you&#x27;re a punk, you&#x27;re an old &quot;hag&quot; on junk&quot; and &quot;You scumbag, you maggot, &quot;you’re cheap and you’re haggard&quot;.”

<doc id="1248105" wikidata="Q27691936" url="?curid=1248105" title="Listuguj Mi'gmaq First Nation">
<text>The Listuguj Mi&#x27;gmaq First Nation () (in Francis-Smith orthography Listukuj Míkmaq) is a Mi&#x27;gmaq First Nations band government with a registered population (2022) of 4,248 members, most of whom are of Mi&#x27;kmaq ancestry. The name &quot;Listuguj&quot;, is the origin for the name of the Restigouche River, as well as other nearby places also carrying the name Restigouche. Listuguj is also used as a name for one of the Míkmaq orthographies. Its southern border is adjacent to Pointe-à-la-Croix, Quebec.

==History==
===Battle of the Restigouche (1760)===
The &quot;Battle of the Restigouche&quot;, was the last naval battle between the British and the French during the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1760, after the fall of Quebec, the French hurried to send reinforcements across the Atlantic. 400 troops were sent in merchant ships from Bordeaux. However, when they reached the Saint Lawrence River, the fleet commander discovered that the area was already occupied by a strong British fleet. He decided to sail south to the bottom of the Bay of Chaleur, and established gun batteries on the shore of the Restigouche River, near Listuguj. Eventually, they were spotted by British Captain John Byron, who engaged battle there. The battle opposed 3 French ships and ground batteries and a coalition of Mi&#x27;gmaq, French and Acadian irregular troops, against a 70-gun British ship and 2 frigates. The French and their allies lost this battle, ending the hopes of reconquering Quebec.

===1981 Salmon Raid===
On June 11 and 20, 1981, the Quebec Provincial Police conducted controversial raids on the reserve to stop the Mi&#x27;gmaq from asserting their control over their native fishery. Federal Indian Affairs Minister John Munro was among those critical of the manner in which the Quebec government and provincial minister Lucien Lessard had acted. All convictions resulting from the arrests were eventually overturned.

The raids and their aftermath were documented by Alanis Obomsawin in her 1984 film &quot;Incident at Restigouche&quot;.

==Arts and culture==
The community is depicted in the 2021 documentary series &quot;Gespe&#x27;gewa&#x27;gi: The Last Land&quot;.

==Government==
Of the members of the Listuguj First Nation, 2,076 persons reside on the federal Indian reserve that was set aside by the legislature of Lower Canada in 1853, for the exclusive use of the majority of Mi&#x27;gmaq in this region. The remaining Mi&#x27;kmaq live off-reserve in the eastern United States and across Canada, but stay connected to the community through modern communications and travel to Listuguj for annual events such as the salmon harvest in June, St. Ann&#x27;s Day in July, or the traditional powwow in August. All community members, regardless of residence, participate in democratic elections held every two years to elect one Chief and twelve Councillors in accordance with Canada&#x27;s Indian Act Election Regulations, however only community members with residence in Listuguj could participate in the Ratification Vote for the Settlement Agreement which took place on December 13, 2014. The community is also allied to other Mi&#x27;gmaq communities in the Gaspé region of Quebec and in northern New Brunswick. Together, their elected Chiefs advance ancestral claims to self-government and to the traditional territory called &quot;Gespe&#x27;gewa&#x27;gi&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Kespékewáki&quot;), the last land.

Gespe&#x27;gewa&#x27;gi is the Mi&#x27;gmaq Nation District that extends from the Miramichi River to the tip of the Gaspé Peninsula, a land area that straddles the modern day Quebec/New Brunswick border. The First Nation is a strong advocate of Aboriginal peoples in Canada, and Aboriginal and treaty rights. Its main resource is the Atlantic salmon and other fruits of the waters and forests, including modern harvest of timber. Political representatives of the Mi&#x27;gmaq of Listuguj and the greater district of Gespe&#x27;gewa&#x27;gi continue talks with the Government of Quebec over access to traditional lands.

<text>Drafting is the process by which preliminary forms of a written work are composed. Separate from other steps of the writing process, such as revision and editing, drafting involves the initial creation of the main content, structure, and style of a work. The preliminary forms of a written work are referred to as draft documents or simply drafts. Drafting is the very first step of the writing process; it gives the writer a base to expand and improve upon their work via later steps.

Drafting almost always involves rounds of cumulatively adding onto and expanding a work. The initial complete draft is known as the first draft or rough draft. Typically, &#x27;snapshots&#x27; of the draft at certain points are taken, these snapshots often being called the drafts; alternatively, the work as it currently is can be referred to as the draft. This distinction is unclear. In an essay writing environment, such as school, drafting often involves rounds of individual brainstorming, collecting evidence, and writing individual paragraphs, along with deciding on the approach to which the essay is written.

== Method ==
Drafting relies primarily on free writing to operate. While drafting, a writer is generally not immediately concerned with grammar or spelling but rather getting their ideas into the page in a physical form. As such, a writer&#x27;s first draft may not even be prose; it could potentially be a list of disconnected ideas or phrases. Writer&#x27;s block is commonly considered to be a major roadblock in the drafting process.

<doc id="1248119" wikidata="Q6326157" url="?curid=1248119" title="KBRD">
<text>KBRD (680 kHz) is a non-commercial radio station broadcasting a nostalgia radio format. It is licensed to Lacey, Washington, and serves the Olympia area. It is owned by the &quot;BJ &amp; Skip&#x27;s for the Music&quot; foundation, a non-profit 501(c)3 organization, so donations are tax deductible. KBRD is dedicated to the preservation of the music of the first half of the 20th century.

KBRD is a daytimer station, powered at 250 watts. Because 680 AM is a clear channel frequency reserved for Class A KNBR San Francisco, to avoid interference, KBRD can only broadcast from sunrise to sunset. But it is heard around the clock on 250-watt FM translator K266BM at 101.1 MHz in Olympia.

==History==
The station signed on the air on . The original call sign was KNTE. On October 7, 1994, the station changed its call letters to KLDY. Then on February 17, 1995, it switched to the current KBRD.

Larry &quot;Skip&quot; Morrow owned an FM radio station but was interested in also owning an AM station. When he purchased the construction permit for KBRD, he didn&#x27;t have enough radio equipment to go on the air. He was also interested in securing the KBRD call sign. When the station was ready to sign on, the call letters belonged to someone else, so the station began as KLDY. When the KBRD call sign became available, Morrow transferred the KLDY call letters to his Classical music AM station at 1280, clearing the way for 680 KBRD.

KBRD was named for BJ, Morrow&#x27;s Moluccan cockatoo, whom he described as the &quot;music director&quot;. If BJ danced to the music, it was put on KBRD&#x27;s playlist. Morrow ran both KBRD and his FM radio station from his living room. Ten years after KBRD went on the air, Morrow died of cancer. Before his death, he transferred ownership of the radio station to a foundation he created: &quot;BJ and Skip&#x27;s for The Music Foundation.&quot; The station is now run by Adrian DeBee (music) and Jack Ondracek (engineering).

==Format==
Although officially described as a &quot;nostalgia&quot; station, KBRD plays an eclectic mixture of jazz, rock, swing, country, dixieland, ragtime, zydeco, western swing, novelty and other music, much of which is not available on commercial radio stations.

A typical hour broadcast on KBRD might contain music by Artie Shaw, Aunt Dinah&#x27;s Quilting Party, Bessie Smith, Boots Randolph, the Clicquot Club Eskimos, Captain Stubby and the Buccaneers, Bing Crosby, the Harmonicats, Sheb Wooley, Marty Robbins, Jelly Roll Morton, Nat King Cole, the Korn Kobblers, George Formby, Nana Mouskouri, Perry Como, Merle Travis, Louis Armstrong and the Hoosier Hot Shots.

KBRD broadcasts without commercial interruption. It seeks donations on the air and on its website.

==Awards==
The KBRD website states that the station was named the 9th best radio station in the country by E! Entertainment .

==Listening online==
KBRD&#x27;s AM signal reaches out only about from Lacey, Washington, and only during daylight hours. It can be heard around the clock on its FM translator, 101.1 K266BM. But that signal is also limited to Lacey, Olympia and adjacent communities. However, KBRD programming is available via streaming media worldwide from its website.

<text>You&#x27;re Gettin&#x27; Even While I&#x27;m Gettin&#x27; Odd is the eleventh and final studio album by American rock band the J. Geils Band and the only one recorded without singer Peter Wolf. The band&#x27;s keyboardist Seth Justman produced the album, did all the song and horn arrangements, wrote all the songs with lyrical help from Paul Justman, and provided the majority of the album&#x27;s lead vocals, with drummer Stephen Jo Bladd singing lead on three tracks. Compared to the band&#x27;s earlier works, which leaned towards a more live rock band sound, &quot;You&#x27;re Gettin&#x27; Even While I&#x27;m Gettin&#x27; Odd&quot; emphasizes overdubbing and production. The album was released on October 5, 1984, by EMI Records.

The album contained one single, &quot;Concealed Weapons&quot;, which peaked at No. 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said of &quot;Concealed Weapons&quot; that &quot;J. Geils here rocks hard and with a contemporary feeling on a track that makes a statement of sorts against its title.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; called it a &quot;playful rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll stomper.&quot;

In 1473, the Portuguese navigator Lopo Gonçalves sailed near Cape Lopez. In 1722, pirates led by Bartholomew Roberts fought a battle in the Cape Lopez Bay against the Royal Navy. The encounter ended in Roberts&#x27; death. The settlement was established on Mandji Island in the delta of the Ogooué River by the French, who signed a treaty with the Orungu people in 1873. It was used as a base for the expeditions of de Brazza into the interior, then in 1894 a customs post was set up, becoming the nucleus of a trading center that included Hatton &amp; Cookson, John Holt, Woermann, Société du Haut-Ogooué, and Compagnie d&#x27;Exploitations Forestières Africaines. The main products were initially rubber and ivory, gradually supplemented by woods, particularly okoumé for plywood.

The town was named after the French colonial administrator Émile Gentil in 1900. After World War I it became a port for timber, but it grew rapidly only after Elf began oil exploration in the area. It received its first bank branch when Bank of West Africa (BAO) opened a branch there in 1928.

The city was the location of the exile of Moroccan nationalist leader Allal al-Fassi who resided in the city between 1937 and 1946.

A 1947 population of 4,500 grew to 21,000 by 1960. An oil refinery was established by SOGARA in the 1960s, with natural gas added in 1968.

The town is now known for its hotels and its nightlife, while attractions include the St Louis Church (built in 1927), a zoo, a casino, beaches and a golf course, as well as the wildlife in local swamps.
==City districts==
The city centre lies next to the harbour on the Port-Gentil Bay seaside. Hotels, banks, shops, and supermarkets (such as the Casino and Cecado brands) and the Casino de Port-Gentil are found within the downtown area between the Avenue Savorgnan de Brazzaville and the seaside. The area also concentrates a residential compound for foreign workforce. In the southern part, the BEAC building lies next to the port. The western Atlantic seaside is scarcely populated, mainly due to the presence of strong winds and sea currents. As is the case with other cities in Gabon, the authorities have not yet implemented house numbering in Port-Gentil, and the use of postal boxes is common.

==Climate==
The Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies Port-Gentil&#x27;s climate as tropical wet and dry (Aw). Despite the fact that the city lies in close proximity to the equator, Port-Gentil experiences noticeably warmer and cooler periods of the year with average temperatures in July (the city&#x27;s coolest month) hovering at around and average temperatures in February and March (the city&#x27;s warmest months) at around . Port-Gentil features a lengthy wet season that runs from October through May and a relatively short dry season that covers the remaining four months. The city receives roughly of precipitation annually.

The highest recorded temperature was on 26 February 2016; the lowest recorded temperature was on 1 August 1953.

==Transportation==

The city has an airport, Port-Gentil International Airport, serving as the main channel of transportation with the world. Regular flights connect it with Libreville, capital of Gabon.

Port-Gentil is connected to the mainland by a series of roads and bridges, stretching 93 km southwards along the coast to Omboué. The project was funded by a loan from the Export–Import Bank of China and constructed by the China Road and Bridge Corporation and GAUFF Engineering.

The limited number of paved roads within the city are poorly maintained. The roads are paved in the inner city up to the outskirts of the new residential districts in N&#x27;Tchengue, where sandy paths with frequent potholes prevail. Traffic jams are common in road junctions such as the Carrefour Tobia or Léon Mba, close to the downtown area. There are plenty of shared taxi services for which the price of a drive is negotiable, starting usually at 400 CFA Francs. The taxi fare usually doubles for night drives. A premium price (doubled fare) is requested for passengers travelling beyond paved roads, given the hardships of the road, lack or non existence of illuminated roads at night, or pedestrians randomly walking on the road. Most of the cars are obsolete given the prohibitively high cost of new imported cars. Furthermore, the lack of local car spareparts manufacturers underscores the need to import such parts from as far as Europe, the increased price as well as the lengthy delivery duration penalize altogether the traffic.

==Healthcare==
Hospitals within Port-Gentil include:&lt;br&gt;* Clinique Mandji, located in the Littoral district on the Route de la Sobraga,&lt;br&gt;* Clinique du Littoral, located on the Boulevard du Gouverneur Pélieu,&lt;br&gt;* Centre du Traitement Ambulatoire on the road to N&#x27;Tchengue.

==Education==
Schools include:
* École Mixte Port-Gentil or École publique conventionnée de Port-Gentil
* École primaire Léopold Sédar Senghor (French primary school)
* Lycée Français Victor Hugo de Port-Gentil (French secondary school)

== Places of worship ==
Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Diocese of Port-Gentil (Catholic Church), Assemblies of God, Evangelical Church of Gabon. There are also Muslim mosques.

<text>Sir Clement Anderson Montague-Barlow, 1st Baronet, KBE (28 February 1868 – 31 May 1951) was an English barrister and Conservative Party politician.

== Life ==
Montague-Barlow was born Clement Anderson Barlow at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Vicarage, Clifton, Gloucestershire, and preferred to be known under his second name, Anderson, rather than his first, Clement. He received a Master&#x27;s degree and an LL.D. from the University of Cambridge and practised at the bar. Between 1910 and 1923 he represented Salford South in the House of Commons. In 1922 he was admitted to the Privy Council upon becoming Minister of Labour, a position he served in until 1924. He was made a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1918 and in 1924 he was created a baronet, of Westminster in the County of London.

In 1937, Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s government asked Barlow to chair a royal commission into the urban concentration of population and industry, &quot;The Royal Commission on the Distribution of the Industrial Population&quot;, which became known as the Barlow Commission. Its report, published in 1940, raised the problem of large towns as a public issue for the first time, and concluded that &quot;planned decentralisation&quot; was favourable. The report was largely ignored at the time, as it came shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, but its conclusions were a major factor behind the new towns movement after the war, which led to the creation of 27 new towns.

In 1946 Barlow changed his last name to Montague-Barlow.

Montague-Barlow died in May 1951, aged 83, when the baronetcy became extinct.

<doc id="1248138" wikidata="Q6749331" url="?curid=1248138" title="Manhattan wiring">
<text>Manhattan wiring (also known as right-angle wiring) is a technique for laying out circuits in computer engineering. Inputs to a circuit (specifically, the interconnects from the inputs) are aligned into a grid, and the circuit &quot;taps&quot; (connects to) them perpendicularly. This may be done either virtually or physically. That is, it may be shown this way only in the documentation and the actual circuit may look nothing like that; or it may be laid out that way on the physical chip. Typically, separate lanes are used for the inverted inputs and are tapped separately. 

The name Manhattan wiring relates to its Manhattan geometry. Reminiscent of how streets in Manhattan, New York tend to criss-cross in a very regular grid, it relates to appearance of such circuit diagrams.

Manhattan wiring is often used to represent a programmable logic array. 

Alternatives include X-architecture wiring, or 45° wiring, and Y-architecture wiring (using wires running in the 0°, 120°, and 240° directions).

KIXI features nostalgic music, such as rock and roll classic oldies mixed in with musical standards. The music spans from the early 1950s through the early 1980s. In recent years the station has moved away from big band music but occasionally plays some. It is the only station in the Seattle area to feature the Imagination Theatre and &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; radio dramas.

KIXI remains one of the few AM radio stations that continues to successfully program music on the AM band. It also enjoys some of the highest ratings of any &quot;Nostalgia&quot; formatted station in the US.

On June 1, 2006, KIXI started to carry the nationally syndicated format Music of Your Life format from Jones Radio Networks. Jones stopped carrying Music of Your Life via satellite in January 2008 in favor of its own standards format, called &quot;Jones Standards&quot; (which has since been discontinued and absorbed into Dial Global&#x27;s America&#x27;s Best Music network). However, KIXI remained until April 2009 an affiliate of Music of Your Life, now distributed by Planet Halo, Incorporated.

The station was the first AM station in Seattle to transmit its signal in IBOC digital radio during a joint demonstration with Harris Corporation and iBiquity, the licensee of the new digital AM transmission method. KIXI can also be heard in HD Radio on KRWM 106.9 FM HD3.

==History==
KIXI took the air in 1947 as KXRN, a 250-watt Renton station broadcasting at 1220 kHz during daytime hours only. KXRN was owned by the Interlake Broadcasting Company. It was built by Frank C. Cook, who was also the radio announcer. In 1951, the station moved to 1230 kHz and changed its call letters to KLAN a year later.

KLAN became a full-time station broadcasting with 1,000 watts at 910 kHz in 1957. Purchased the following year by former KRSC and KJR personality Wally Nelskog, the station became top-40 KQDE, or &quot;Cutie Radio&quot;. A sister station on 1230 kHz in Everett, KQTY, also used the same branding. One of Seattle&#x27;s first black deejays, Bob Summerrise, brought an R&amp;B influence to his airshift on KQDE. (Summerrise would later own soul-formatted KYAC, which took the air in 1964.) In 1960, KQDE would change its call letters to the more phonetic KUDY and changed its city of license to Seattle.

Failing to make an impact in the top-40 battle dominated by KJR and KOL, the station became beautiful music KIXI in late 1961. (The call letters were a Roman numeral representation of the station&#x27;s &quot;9-1&quot; dial position.) Bob Liddle, formerly of KXL and KEX in Portland, Oregon, joined the airstaff and would stay with KIXI for 45 years. During the 1970s, Liddle teamed with Dean Smith on &quot;News 90&quot;, one of Seattle&#x27;s first all-news morning drive programs.

A partnership led by J. Elroy McCaw, owner of Tacoma television station KTVW and father of future cellular telephone tycoon Craig McCaw, purchased a 50-percent interest in KIXI in 1963. The group also acquired FM beautiful music station KGMJ from Rogan Jones, founder of the pioneering radio automation firm IGM. KGMJ became KIXI-FM and simulcasted the AM station&#x27;s programming. McCaw died suddenly of a stroke in 1969, exposing a considerable amount of debt accumulated from his speculation on radio and television stations, including WINS in New York and KYA in San Francisco. With the exception of a small cable television system in Centralia, McCaw&#x27;s entire broadcasting portfolio was sold off to pay down the debt service. Wally Nelskog and two Richland physicians purchased KIXI and KIXI-FM in 1971.

The beautiful music simulcast ended in 1980, with the AM side adopting an oldies format and the FM station programming adult contemporary as &quot;KIXI Lite&quot;. A move to the 880 kHz frequency a year later allowed for a daytime power boost to 50,000 watts, and in 1986, a nighttime increase to 10,000 watts. With the move, KIXI (AM) began running a satellite-fed adult standards format. That same year, Nelskog sold the station to Thunder Bay Communications. In December 1987, the group sold the AM station to Sunbelt Communications, while the FM station, which had become KLTX, was sold to Ackerley.

KIXI was purchased by Sandusky Radio, owners of KLSY, in November 1991. Hiring personalities such as Jim Dai and Dan Murphy in 1993, the station dropped the AM Only satellite service for a locally voicetracked lineup. Bob Dearborn, best known for his work at WCFL in Chicago, was the KIXI program director from 1994 to 1999. He was replaced by Bob Brooks, formerly of KLSY.

While the aging demographics of the adult standards audience forced many stations in larger markets to drop the format in the late 1990s, KIXI continued to enjoy modest success, often selling advertising time as an &quot;add-on&quot; to spots on KLSY or the other stations in the Sandusky Seattle group. Finally, in a move that led to an outcry from a loyal listener base, KIXI abruptly began airing Music of Your Life satellite programming on June 1, 2006. With the exception of Dan Murphy, who continued to voice station promotions and weekday weather forecasts, the entire KIXI airstaff was terminated. In April 2009, KIXI dropped the Music of Your Life programming after three years and returned to local programming. In the past ten years the station gradually modified its sound to more of an oldies format playing some rock and roll oldies as well as some early soft rock along with some traditional pop standards mixed in. In July 2013, Sandusky announced it would sell its radio holdings in Seattle and Phoenix, Arizona to Hubbard Broadcasting. The sale was completed that November. However, the station is now largely voicetracked and automated - with total operations being overseen by Dan Murphy. COVID-19 forced cuts at KIXI on May 12, 2020. Dan Murphy was cut from the staff by Hubbard Broadcasting.

<doc id="1248148" wikidata="Q6329813" url="?curid=1248148" title="KSFO">
<text>KSFO (810 AM) is a commercial radio station licensed to San Francisco, California, United States, most recently featuring a conservative talk radio format. Owned by Cumulus Media, KSFO&#x27;s studios are located are on Battery Street in the SoMa portion of San Francisco&#x27;s Financial District.

KSFO&#x27;s transmitter site is in Fremont, near the Dumbarton Bridge, where its prominent towers are landmarks used by pilots as a waypoint in communications with local airports. KSFO broadcasts with 50,000 watts, the highest power permitted for AM stations by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). It uses a directional antenna fulltime with a three-tower array. Most of its signal is sent north and south to avoid interfering with the other Class A station on 810 kHz. Most nights, using a good radio, KSFO can be heard throughout the Western United States and Western Canada. Due to its extensive groundwave signal, its daytime coverage extends into many areas of Northern California.

==History==
===1920s and 1930s===
After several late-night test broadcasts, using the experimental call sign 6XG, the station signed on, as KGO, on January 8, 1924. It broadcast from General Electric&#x27;s (GE) Oakland transformer manufacturing plant. (The original two-story brick building, constructed specifically for the station on East 14th Street, was demolished sometime in the 1980s.) The station was authorized for a then-impressive transmitting power of 1,000 watts. KGO was part of GE&#x27;s three-station holdings, in addition to WGY in Schenectady, New York and KOA in Denver, Colorado. At its debut it was known as the &quot;Sunset Station&quot;, because it was GE&#x27;s West Coast outlet.

As was the custom with early radio stations, the programming consisted of performances by local talent, including the KGO Orchestra. which provided some of the music, and a dramatic group known as the KGO Players, which performed weekly plays and short skits, often under the direction of Bay Area drama instructor Wilda Wilson Church. The station&#x27;s music, which was also performed by other local orchestras and vocalists, included classical selections as well as popular dance music the next night. Due to GE&#x27;s association with the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), and RCA&#x27;s 1927 launch of the NBC Red Network, KGO was soon operated by NBC management out of studio facilities in San Francisco.
The March 28, 1928 reauthorization of the Radio Act of 1927 included a provision, known as the Davis Amendment, which mandated an &quot;equality of radio broadcasting service&quot; within the United States. This specified an &quot;equitable allocation&quot; among five regional zones. On November 11, 1928, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) implemented a major broadcasting station reallocation, based on its General Order 40. Included in this band plan was the designation of what became known as &quot;clear channel&quot; stations, which were high powered stations with extensive nighttime coverage. This plan designated 40 U.S. clear channels, divided eight to each region, with KGO, on 790 kHz, included as one of the Region 5 assignments. The only other station assigned to 790 kHz was WGY. KGO and WGY were both owned by GE, with WGY considered the company&#x27;s showcase station. GE was able to effectively transfer KGO&#x27;s clear channel assignment from Region 5 to WGY&#x27;s Region 1, by increasing the power of WGY to 50,000 watts, while limiting KGO to 7,500 watts. (Directional antennas were not developed until the early 1930s, so both stations operated with non-directional antennas.) Any question about the propriety of this action became moot after the Davis Amendment was repealed on June 5, 1936.

===1940s and 1950s===
In 1941, stations on 790, including WGY and KGO, were moved to 810 as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA).

When the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required NBC to sell one of its two networks (and that network&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations), KGO&#x27;s license switched from Radio Corporation of America to the Blue Network, Inc., effective January 23, 1942. The NBC Blue Network initially simply dropped &quot;NBC&quot; from its name to become the &quot;Blue Network&quot;, then in June 1945 became the American Broadcasting Company. KGO became one of the founding stations of the ABC Radio Network as a result.

In the post World War 2 period, KGO produced many live music programs, including that of Western Swing bandleader Bob Wills, whose music was a staple of the time. KGO was instrumental in bringing the first exercise show to broadcasting, hosted by Jack LaLanne, a fitness instructor and gym operator in nearby Oakland. LaLanne conducted his radio fitness show for many years on KGO, moving in the late 1950s to KGO-TV and a successful TV syndication career.

On December 1, 1947, KGO&#x27;s power was increased to 50,000 watts, as it switched to a directional antenna that limited its signal toward WGY in the west, while WGY continued to operate with a non-directional antenna. It was reported at the time that KGO&#x27;s upgrade &quot;retired the nation&#x27;s oldest regularly operating transmitter-a 7,500-watter... in use since Jan. 8, 1924&quot;.

By the late 1950s, KGO suffered from poor ratings. In 1962, ABC installed new management, including program director Jim Dunbar from Chicago sister station WLS. Dunbar revamped the station into one of the country&#x27;s first news/talk stations. While the new format was initially unsuccessful, Dunbar stressed the &quot;live and local&quot; aspect of the programming by running the talk shows every day from locations such as Johnny Kan&#x27;s Chinese restaurant, Señor Pico&#x27;s Restaurant, and the hungry i nightclub. This higher profile caused KGO&#x27;s ratings to begin a steady climb. Among KGO&#x27;s personalities during this period was future Radio Hall of Fame member J.P. McCarthy, the station&#x27;s morning host in the early 1960s.

===1960s–1980s===
After trying various formats, KGO eventually shifted to news and talk programming, relying heavily on the ABC radio network for its news programs. KGO started carrying Paul Harvey&#x27;s twice-daily programs but also began to develop a strong local news staff that produced extended morning and afternoon newscasts. The local talk show hosts included Les Crane, Owen Spann and Jim Eason, who often interviewed visiting celebrities in the KGO studios. Owen Spann also originated special broadcasts from Europe and Africa, interviewing government officials from those countries. Local director-actor Jack Brooks hosted a Saturday-morning entertainment program until his sudden death in June 1984, after directing a production of &quot;Kismet&quot; for the Capuchino Community Theatre that featured Jim Eason as the poet Omar Khayyám. Dr. Dean Edell began his regular medical programs at KGO, leading to nationally syndicated broadcasts

Two of KGO&#x27;s three towers partially collapsed during the Loma Prieta earthquake on October 17, 1989. All three were replaced.

===1990s–2010s===
In March 2008, solar panels were installed at KGO&#x27;s transmitter site in Fremont, California, to offset some of its power consumption during daytime hours. The installation was a test bed for Pacific Gas and Electric Company and is located near the Dumbarton Bridge. The solar system uses both CPV (SolFocus) and PV (Premier Power) arrays and provides about 17 Kilowatts, or 33% (one third), of the radio frequency (RF) power output from the 50KW transmitter (or about one-tenth of the total power consumption of their transmitter site over a 24-hour period). United States Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi turned the system on during an on-air ceremony.

For over 30 years, from July 1978 to January 2009, KGO was the number-one station in the San Francisco Bay Area in the Arbitron ratings, a feat unmatched by any other station in the United States. According to the 2010 Arbitron ratings, however, KGO had lost its lead to KCBS, with KOIT-FM as a close second, and KGO listing at third. When KGO switched to all-news in December 2011, it fell further behind in the local ratings. As of Spring 2013, KGO placed 16th in the market, with approximately half of their listenership when they were number one.

Until December 5, 2011, KGO created nearly all of its own local programming, with very limited syndicated content. The majority of its programs were hosted by San Francisco Bay Area broadcasters. The daily schedule included many issues-oriented talk shows, with weekday hosts that included Gene Burns, Gil Gross, Ronn Owens, John Rothmann and lawyer Len Tillem. The station also carried a variety of specialty programs, particularly on weekends, with John Hamilton discussing travel and leisure, Gene Burns covering fine food and dining (on a show separate from his weekday program), Joanie Greggains hosting a health-and-fitness program, and Brent Walters, who teaches &quot;Comparative Religions&quot; at San Jose State University, hosting the early Sunday morning show, &quot;God Talk.&quot; In 2014, KGO brought in John Batchelor at midnight. News/talk weekend hosts now include Brian Copeland, &quot;Karel&quot; Charles Karel Bouley, and Pat Thurston.

Up to 2011, the weekday morning news (from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m.) was co-anchored by Jon Bristow and Jennifer Jones-Lee. The afternoon news (from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m.) featured veteran reporter Chris Brecher and award-winning reporter/anchor Bret Burkhart.

Until the format change in December 2011, KGO hosted an annual fundraiser called the &quot;KGO Cure-a-Thon&quot; to help raise money for The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society with all of the station&#x27;s regular programming pre-empted for an entire day during the event. Listeners were encouraged to call in and donate money to help in the fight against these kinds of cancer. An auction was also held to help raise money. Notable items up for auction have included a trip with Gene Burns on a private jet to various destinations, such as Las Vegas and Italy, for a gourmet dinner. Cumulus Media has announced that it will not be continuing the KGO Cure-a-Thon charity event despite the fact it has raised millions of dollars for charity in the past.

On December 2, 2011, new owner Cumulus Media announced that KGO was rebranding itself as &quot;news and information&quot;, moving to an all-news format from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. (in addition to the existing morning-drive, noon-hour and afternoon-drive news blocks). The change was scheduled for December 5. This had resulted in the abrupt termination, on December 1, of most of the talk hosts (including Gene Burns, Gil Gross, John Rothmann, Ray Taliaferro, Len Tillem, and Dr. Bill Wattenburg). Ronn Owens&#x27;s morning show, as well as weekend talk programming remained, although some of the weekend hosts (including Joanie Greggains, and Len Tillem) were also terminated on December 1, 2011. Bob Brinker&#x27;s syndicated &quot;Moneytalk&quot; was moved to KSFO, a politically conservative talk radio sister station which arguably better reflects Brinker&#x27;s conservative politico-economic views. KGO also dropped Leo Laporte&#x27;s weekend syndicated tech talk program in the format change. Gil Gross, Len Tillem and Leo Laporte would all move to competitor KKSF.

The format change and termination of many popular talk show hosts sparked outrage among long-time listeners, many of whom called for sponsors to drop their advertising on the station. Ratings declined substantially following the change, with competitors KCBS and KQED-FM continuing to lead the market, and in December 2014, KGO reintroduced talk programming on weekdays. In December 2014, KGO added Chip Franklin to the noon to 3 pm lineup. In January 2015, KGO announced they had hired Chicago/San Antonio radio personality Kevin &quot;DreX&quot; Buchar, best known for his successful morning show on Chicago&#x27;s WKSC-FM, which ran for more than a decade, from 7PM to 10PM. John Batchelor&#x27;s syndicated show aired overnights, returning KGO to the same level of news programming as before 2011.

Both KGO and Dallas-based sister station KLIF shared similar visual &quot;News/Information&quot; identities after KLIF&#x27;s parent Cumulus acquired Citadel, until 2014, when talk programming was reintroduced.

At noon on March 31, 2016, KGO dropped its previous programming and began stunting with recordings of speeches from influential figures and people talking about San Francisco, as well as songs about the city, while promoting &quot;The Next Generation of KGO&quot; to launch on April 5 (though with a break during the weekend for paid programming). At least 20 people, including the entire news staff, as well as some staffers from sister station KFOG, were laid off with the change. Originally, long-time KGO host Ronn Owens announced that he would be moving to sister station KSFO in the afternoon slot beginning April 4. However, due to what was advertised as a &quot;listener reaction&quot; against the move (in reality, Owens contested the move of his show off KGO as against the terms of his contract), Owens stayed with KGO. KGO kept its news/talk format, but relaunched it with a new live and local lineup, which included Owens and &quot;Armstrong &amp; Getty&quot; in mornings; &quot;Armstrong &amp; Getty&quot;, a regionally syndicated program based at KSTE in Sacramento, had previously aired in the Bay Area on KKSF. Owens left the station in 2018, and &quot;Armstrong &amp; Getty&quot; moved to KSFO in 2020 to be replaced by Nikki Medoro, previously an afternoon news anchor.

===2022–2024: Sports betting as &quot;The Spread&quot;===
On October 6, 2022, at approximately 10:16 a.m., KGO abruptly ended the news/talk format in the middle of midday host Mark Thompson&#x27;s show. Thompson later said he had been informed just before going on-air that a format change would be implemented shortly, but was asked not to use the opportunity to say goodbye to listeners. Instead, mid-show, Thompson was signaled to give a final station identification.

The station then began a stunt loop featuring songs and promotional announcements referring to betting, money, and winning. The promotions stated that a new format, billed as &quot;the most unique radio station in the Bay Area&quot;, would launch on October 10, assuring listeners that they &quot;can bet on it&quot;. On that day, KGO launched a sports talk format emphasizing sports betting, branded as &quot;810 The Spread&quot;. The new format had no local programming, and the station&#x27;s schedule was primarily sourced from the BetQL and Infinity Sports (formerly CBS Sports Radio) networks, serving as a complement to sister sports stations KNBR-FM and KTCT. Some hours on weekends were money-related paid brokered programming.

===2024–2025: Move of KSFO to 810 kHz===
On November 15, 2024, Cumulus announced that KSFO would move to 810 kHz on November 18. Most KSFO programming was simulcast on both 810 AM and 560 AM beginning that date under the &quot;810 KSFO&quot; brand, except for Golden Bears sports events airing only on 810.

The KGO call sign was retired on January 1, 2025 in favor of KSFO; on the same day, 560 AM, formerly KSFO, became KZAC, but retained the simulcast with the new KSFO.

==Programming==
From 1962 until 2022, KGO carried news and talk programming. In October 2022, the station switched to a sports talk format, with an emphasis on sports betting. It carried the BetQL Network most of the day, with some shows from the Infinity Sports Network at night.

KSFO is one of four AM stations owned by Cumulus Media in the San Francisco Bay Area, along with KZAC, 680 KNBR, and 1050 KTCT. KGO was the radio home for the San Francisco 49ers football team from 1987 to 2005. It has been broadcasting University of California, Berkeley Golden Bears Football games since 1974. Since 2013, it also broadcasts select California Golden Bears men&#x27;s basketball games. The station began to air San Jose Earthquakes soccer games in 2023.

<text>KNX (1070 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station in Los Angeles, California. It simulcasts an all-news radio format with sister station 97.1 KNX-FM, both owned by Audacy, Inc. KNX is one of the oldest stations in the United States, having received its first broadcasting license, as KGC, on 8 December 1921, in addition to tracing its history to the September 1920 operations of an earlier amateur station. The studios and offices—shared with KNX-FM, KCBS-FM, KROQ-FM, KRTH and KTWV—are located on Wilshire Boulevard, along Los Angeles&#x27; Miracle Mile.

KNX holds a Class A license as one of the original clear-channel stations. Its 50,000-watt non-directional signal is heard throughout all of Southern California in the daytime. When conditions are right, it can be picked up at night throughout much of the Western United States and parts of Mexico and Canada. The station is even received by DXers in Hawaii and across the Pacific Ocean. The transmitter site is in Columbia Park in Torrance, near Hawthorne Boulevard (California State Route 107) and 190th Street. KNX is authorized to broadcast a digital HD Radio signal.

KNX and KFI are the local primary stations for the Los Angeles Emergency Alert System. They are responsible for activation of the EAS when hazardous weather alerts, and disaster area declarations are issued.

==Programming==

KNX-AM-FM broadcast &quot;traffic and weather together&quot; every ten minutes on the fives with traffic reports on the freeways and toll roads in the Greater Los Angeles area and weather forecasts for Southern California, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Business news from Bloomberg Radio and sports headlines are heard every half hour. Each hour begins with world and national news from CBS News Radio. The two stations are branded as &quot;KNX News 97.1 FM&quot;.

==History==
===Origin===
Although KNX received its first broadcasting station license on December 8, 1921, the station has traditionally dated its founding to September 10, 1920, reflecting boadcasts conducted by Fred Christian over his amateur station, 6ADZ.

Mr. Christian was trained as a shipboard radio operator. He lived at 5118½ Harold Way in Hollywood, California. He was manager for the Electric Lighting Supply Company at 216 West Third Street, Los Angeles. He once explained that he began the broadcasts in order to provide something to listen to for those customers who had constructed receivers from parts purchased for their radio shack. Christian began making broadcasts with a five-watt vacuum-tube transmitter, operating on the standard amateur wavelength of 200 meters (1500 kHz).

===KGC===
Initially there were no specific standards in the United States for radio stations making transmissions intended for the general public, and numerous stations under various classifications made entertainment broadcasts. However, effective December 1, 1921, the Department of Commerce, regulators of radio at this time, adopted a regulation that formally created a broadcasting station category, and stations were now required to hold a Limited Commercial license authorizing operation on wavelengths of 360 meters (833 kHz) for &quot;entertainment&quot; broadcasts or 485 meters (619 kHz) for &quot;market and weather reports&quot;. By the end of 1922 over 500 stations were authorized nationwide.

On December 8, 1921, the Electric Lighting Supply Company was issued a broadcasting station license with the randomly assigned call letters KGC, the second in the county after KQL, authorizing operation on the 360-meter entertainment wavelength. The station&#x27;s location was listed as Fred Christian&#x27;s Harold Way home. The shared 360 meter wavelength required timesharing agreements between an increasing number of stations needing exclusive time periods. On May 4 the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that a total of seven local stations were slated to make broadcasts that day, comprising a schedule that ran from noon to 9:00 p.m., with KGC assigned 2:00-2:30 and 7:30-8:00 p.m.

===KNX===
On May 4, 1922, the Electric Lighting Supply Company was issued a broadcasting license for a station with the randomly assigned call letters of KNX, also on 360 meters, and located at the company&#x27;s Los Angeles store on West Third Street. This was technically considered to be a second station in addition to KGC, however, after KGC was formally deleted on June 20, 1922, the Department of Commerce concluded that KGC and KNX were functionally the same station, and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) records list KGC&#x27;s December 8, 1921, initial license date as KNX&#x27;s &quot;date first licensed&quot;.

The new authorization coincided with preparations for a move to the California Theater, broadcasting live music, with Fred Christian continuing as station manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;theradiohistorian.org/knx&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On June 12, 1922, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that &quot;After more than two months of preparation, the new broadcast station at the California Theater had its opening program Saturday evening at 9:15, sending out a wavelength of 510 meters [588 kHz]. The station is said to be one of the best in the land, the call letters of which are KNX.&quot; KNX&#x27;s regular broadcast schedule on 360 meters was 9:00 to 10:00 a.m. A week after it commenced operations from the theater, the &quot;Times&quot; reported that &quot;Numerous reports have come into The Times radio department commending the quality and audibility of material broadcast from KNX, the California Theater radiophone. This station differs from other stations in that it gives its listeners-in the music of the complete orchestra of the California Theater.&quot;

KNX&#x27;s power was raised to 100 watts in early August 1922.

===Los Angeles Evening Express===
In the fall of 1924, Guy Earl Jr., owner of the &quot;Los Angeles Evening Express&quot;, arranged for the newspaper&#x27;s purchase of KNX. The &quot;Express&quot; made significant upgrades, including increasing the power to 500 watts, and began broadcasting from the Paul G. Hoffman Studebaker building in Hollywood. KNX was one of the last stations to remain on the original 360 meter wavelength, and the newspaper engineered a move to 890 kHz. It remained on this frequency until November 11, 1928, when the station was reassigned to 1050 kHz, under the provisions of a major reallocation resulting from the Federal Radio Commission&#x27;s (FRC) General Order 40.

In early 1928, Guy Earle sold his share of the Evening Express newspaper and reorganized KNX as the Western Broadcast Company. In 1929, Earle moved the KNX studios to the Paramount Pictures lot, signing a five-year contract, and the station&#x27;s transmitter power was upgraded from 500 to 5,000 watts. In 1930, KNX became the first station to broadcast the Academy Awards. In 1932, it increased to 10,000 watts. In 1933, the station moved its studios to the former Peerless Motor Company building at 5939 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, after being granted permission by the FRC on June 7, 1932, to raise its output to 25,000 watts. The following year, KNX&#x27;s transmitting power was raised to the nationwide maximum of 50,000 watts, which the station continues presently.

===CBS ownership===
CBS purchased KNX in 1936 and began operating it as its West Coast flagship, which ended CBS&#x27;s eight-year affiliation with KHJ. In 1938, the CBS Columbia Square studios were dedicated for KNX as well as West Coast operations for the entire CBS radio network. That October, the station carried Orson Welles&#x27; celebrated version of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. In March 1941 the station was shifted to 1070 AM as part of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement assignments, where it has been ever since.

Theatre legend Jerome Lawrence got his start in radio writing at KNX in the late 1930s. Legendary performers from the &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot; used KNX studios for their national broadcasts, included Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, George Burns, Edgar Bergen and Gene Autry. Steve Allen conducted a freewheeling late night show over KNX in the late 1940s, which opened the door to his national success. TV situation comedy star Bob Crane was KNX&#x27;s morning host between 1957 and 1965 at the same time he was appearing as a featured supporting player on the ABC television network series &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;.

===FM and TV stations===
On March 30, 1948, KNX added a sister station. The original station with the call sign KNX-FM signed on the air, mostly simulcasting 1070 AM. At first it was on the old FM band, but switched to 93.1 a few years later. Today that station is KCBS-FM, while a new version of KNX-FM exists today on 97.1 as a simlicast of the AM station.

In 1951, KNX gained a television cousin when CBS acquired KTSL channel 2 and rebranded it as KNXT. It took on the current KCBS-TV call sign in 1984. It traces its history back to 1930s experimental broadcasts and was originally owned by broadcast pioneer Don Lee.

===Switch to all-news===

KNX was a strong competitor in the Los Angeles market while Bob Crane was its morning personality, but began declining in popularity after he left to star in the CBS television series &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;. Following the example of corporate sister station WCBS in New York City, which had enjoyed success with an all-news format, KNX then became an all-news station in the spring of 1968. By chance, its first major breaking news coverage was a major worldwide story that happened locally: the assassination of Democratic Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, on June 5 of that year.

In August 2005, KNX moved out of Columbia Square after operating there for 67 years, and began broadcasting from new studios in the Miracle Mile district on Wilshire Boulevard.

In 2009, KNX adopted the slogan &quot;All news, all the time&quot;. It was previously used for 40 years by KFWB, KNX&#x27;s historic rival in the news radio wars before both became sister stations through the 1995 merger of Westinghouse Electric (KFWB&#x27;s owner) and CBS. KFWB&#x27;s format change to news-talk in September 2009 left KNX as the only all-news outlet in the Los Angeles area, which is now emphasized in its alternate slogan, &quot;Southern California&#x27;s only 24-hour local news &amp; traffic station&quot;.

In 2017, KNX won its first ever national Edward R. Murrow award for &quot;Breaking News&quot;. The station was also nominated for two 2017 NAB Marconi awards, Legendary Station of the Year and News/Talk Station of the Year.

===Entercom and Audacy===
On February 2, 2017, CBS agreed to merge CBS Radio with Entercom, then the fourth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States. The sale was conducted tax-free using a Reverse Morris Trust. While CBS shareholders retained a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom was the surviving entity, separating KNX from KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated 8 days later.

On March 30, 2021, Entercom announced that the company changed its name to Audacy.

On December 6, 2021, KNX announced that it would be adding an FM simulcast. KNX&#x27;s all-news programming would also be heard on sister station KNOU, replacing the Top 40 format on the station that began in 2009. KNOU changed its call letters to KNX-FM on December 21, 2021, to match its AM simulcast partner.

==Transmitter site==
The station&#x27;s antenna array features a 494-foot (150m) main antenna. The original main tower (circa 1936) was destroyed by vandals on September 14, 1965. An unused 365-foot (111m) tower was brought in from KFAC (now KWKW) and was used while the new main antenna was constructed. This antenna was formerly in what is now a residential area to the south of the main antenna.

The 365-foot tower now serves as KNX&#x27;s emergency antenna. It was later relocated when much of the site was dedicated as a park in Torrance. It is now north of the main antenna, within the park.

Only one antenna is active at a time. An experiment in the late 1960s using both antennas in a directional setup during the daytime was abandoned.

The 494-foot main antenna is 0.53λ, or 193.5 electrical degrees. It has an efficiency of 400.73 mV/m/kW at 1 km. This is much better than average for a Class A station&#x27;s main antenna. The FCC&#x27;s minimum efficiency requirement is 362.10 mV/m/kW at 1 km.

The 365-foot emergency antenna is 0.40λ, or 145.5 electrical degrees. It has an efficiency of about 343 mV/m/kW at 1 km. This is much better than average for a Class A emergency antenna but is inadequate for the main antenna.

<doc id="1248166" wikidata="Q6332012" url="?curid=1248166" title="KKOB (AM)">
<text>KKOB (770 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station, licensed to Albuquerque, New Mexico and owned by Cumulus Media. Its news/talk format is branded as &quot;96.3 Newsradio KKOB&quot;, reflecting a simulcast with co-owned KKOB-FM 96.3 MHz. Studios and offices are located in Downtown Albuquerque. KKOB is the oldest station in New Mexico and is the state&#x27;s primary entry point for the Emergency Alert System.

KKOB&#x27;s transmitter site is off Second Street NW in North Valley. It is a Class B facility, operating around the clock with 50,000 watts, the maximum allowed in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). During the daytime, it uses a non-directional signal that reaches most of New Mexico&#x27;s populated areas, as well as parts of Colorado and Arizona. At night, it uses a directional antenna, primarily to limit its signal to the east in the direction of WABC in New York City, the primary Class A station on 770 AM. With a good radio KKOB can be heard at night across much of the western half of North America. To compensate for KKOB&#x27;s loss of signal at night in Santa Fe, since 1986, it has been simulcast on 770 kHz by a 230-watt experimental synchronous transmitter located in that city.

==Programming==
=== News and talk ===
KKOB-AM-FM provide local news and weather updates around the clock, traffic &quot;on the 7&#x27;s&quot; and national news updates from ABC News Radio. On weekdays, the schedule features mostly local talk shows including Bob Clark in morning drive time, Brandon Vogt middays, TJ Trout afternoons and Eric Strauss in the evening. The rest of the schedule is nationally syndicated talk radio hosts Dan Bongino, Mark Levin, &quot;Red Eye Radio&quot; and &quot;America in The Morning&quot;.

Weekends include shows on money, health, home repair, gardening, cars, travel and technology, some of which are paid brokered programming. Terry Travis hosts a local talk show on weekend mornings. Syndicated shows on weekends include Chris Plante, Rudy Maxa and Bill Cunningham.

=== Sports ===
KKOB broadcasts University of New Mexico Lobos basketball and football games. Some other Lobo sports can also be heard on co-owned sports radio station KNML.

==History==
===Early years===
The station began as KOB, first licensed by the federal government on April 5, 1922. However, the person most responsible for its founding, Ralph Willis Goddard, by this time already had extensive experience with radio. Goddard was the dean of the Engineering School at New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (now New Mexico State University). It was located in State College, New Mexico, near Las Cruces. Goddard headed the school&#x27;s Radio Club, and in the spring of 1920, arranged for the university to be issued a license for an experimental radio station, which was issued the call sign 5XD. In addition to experimental work, this station was used for such things as reporting sport scores. Eventually the station expanded from its initial Morse code transmissions to audio programs, including entertainment broadcasts.

Initially, there were no formal standards for radio stations making broadcasts intended for the general public. However, effective December 1, 1921, the United States Department of Commerce, which supervised radio at this time, issued a regulation requiring that stations making broadcasts intended for the general public now had to operate under a &quot;Limited Commercial&quot; license. On April 5, 1922, the university was issued a broadcasting station license with the randomly assigned call letters KOB.

The 1928 passage of the Davis Amendment required an equitable assignment of radio facilities within five regions of the United States. Effective November 11, 1928, as part of a major reassignment of stations under the Federal Radio Commission&#x27;s General Order 40, KOB was assigned to 1180 kHz, one of Region 5&#x27;s high-powered &quot;clear channel&quot; frequencies. Although this allowed unlimited operation during daylight hours, nighttime hours were shared with KEX in Portland, Oregon, with KOB receiving 1/3rd of the after-sunset hours, and KEX assigned the rest.

On December 31, 1929, while preparing the transmitter for a New Year&#x27;s Eve broadcast, Goddard was instantly killed when he came into contact with high voltage equipment. In 1932 the station reduced its power from 20 to 10 kilowatts because of transmitter issues.

===&quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot; ownership===

In 1932, the university arranged for KOB to be leased by the &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot;, which later purchased the station. KOB&#x27;s last State College broadcast was on April 24, and it resumed broadcasting that fall in Albuquerque. KOB was an NBC Red Network affiliate, carrying its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;.

In 1940, KOB&#x27;s timesharing partner, KEX, moved to 1160 kHz, which allowed KOB to expand its nighttime operating hours to unlimited. In March 1941, a nationwide frequency reassignment took place with the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA). Initially, KOB was assigned to 1030 kHz. WBZ in Boston, Massachusetts was the primary station assigned to 1030 kHz; moreover, it employed a directional antenna that strengthened its signal toward the west. The resulting excessive nighttime interference between WBZ and KOB caused the FCC to reassign KOB to 770 kHz. However, WJZ (now WABC) in New York City was also assigned to 770 kHz, and this led to a series of legal battles between the two stations over nighttime coverage that would last for decades.

 In 1948, Tom Pepperday, owner and publisher of the &quot;Journal&quot;, signed on KOB-TV, the first television station between the Mississippi River and the West Coast. The stations were acquired by Time Life in 1952. In 1957, they were sold to Hubbard Broadcasting, Inc. On August 1, 1967, KOB-FM (now KOBQ) first signed on. At first, it simulcast KOB, but soon began its own format of beautiful music, and in the 1980s, switched to adult contemporary music.

===Separation of KOB radio and KOB-TV===

Hubbard Broadcasting sold KOB AM and FM to Southwest Radio in 1986. At the time, FCC regulations stated that stations could not share call signs if they were not co-owned, so with Hubbard keeping the TV station as KOB-TV, Southwest had to find new call letters for the radio stations. In order to trade on the well-known KOB identity, a leading &quot;K&quot; was appended, becoming KKOB and KKOB-FM on October 28. Despite their separate ownership, KKOB still has a news partnership with KOB-TV.

In 1994, KKOB AM and FM were sold to Citadel Broadcasting for $7.8 million. In 2011, Citadel was acquired by the station&#x27;s current owner, Cumulus Media. Under Cumulus ownership, some shows syndicated by Premiere Networks were dropped, such as Coast-to-Coast AM and Sean Hannity, because Premiere is owned by Cumulus rival iHeartMedia. KKOB switched to mostly airing programs syndicated by Cumulus Media&#x27;s Westwood One subsidiary, only retaining one Premiere Networks weekday show, Rush Limbaugh until his death in 2021. Dan Bongino took over the midday time slot previously held by Limbaugh on all Cumulus stations on May 24, 2021.

On September 1, 2016, KKOB began simulcasting its programming over translator station K233CG (94.5 FM) in Sandia, which Cumulus purchased for $425,000.

===Legal dispute with WABC===

Beginning in 1941, KOB was involved in a 38-year-long dispute over the use of the 770 kHz frequency with New York City station WABC (originally WJZ), a Class I-A clear-channel station. In 1978, the FCC noted that &quot;No other station assignment among the thousands so far established has approached this one in the length, complexity, and thoroughness of the consideration that has been accorded in adjudicatory and rulemaking proceedings before the Commission, and in repeated judicial reviews.&quot;

In March 1941, with the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), most of the original &quot;clear channel&quot; stations were reassigned to comparable authorizations. The FCC attempted to give KOB an assignment that would allow it to use high power to serve a large area of the underserved southwestern United States. KOB&#x27;s initial 1941 NARBA assignment was for operation on 1030 kHz. However, another high-powered station, WBZ in Boston, Massachusetts, was also assigned to this frequency; moreover, WBZ employed a directional antenna that strengthened its signal westward. The resulting nighttime interference between WBZ and KOB caused the FCC, beginning later in 1941, to reassign KOB to 770 kHz with the first of a series of temporary Special Service Authorizations.

The joint assignment of KOB and WABC to 770 kHz still resulted in interference over large areas of the middle of the country. The FCC later concluded that KOB and WABC should have equal status on 770 kHz as &quot;Class I-B&quot; stations, with both required to protect the nighttime coverage of the other station, and ordered that KOB and WJZ both install directional antennas. KOB constructed the required nighttime directional antenna, but WABC refused to comply, appealing the order in the courts. WABC&#x27;s challenge was successful, primarily on the grounds that downgrading its coverage left its ABC network at a disadvantage compared to the other two national networks&#x27; New York City stations, CBS&#x27;s WCBS and NBC&#x27;s WNBC, which were non-directional operations. The FCC then reclassified KOB as a &quot;Class II-A&quot; station, and its directional antenna was modified to further reduce its signal toward WABC.

=== Hot air balloon accidents ===

On October 9, 2004, a Smokey Bear special shape hot air balloon participating in the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta collided with and became entangled in one of KKOB&#x27;s transmitter towers. The three passengers were able to climb out of the basket onto the tower. However, the tower was energized and could have led to electrocution once the passengers set foot on ground, so KKOB shut down its transmitter following the accident in order to enable them to climb down to safety. This accident was recorded by several local television stations, and the footage has become a standard story on a number of televised reality programs which deal with &quot;caught on camera&quot; incidents.

On October 11, 2024 a hot air balloon participating in the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta hit the north tower and caused it to collapse. The balloon was able to land safely and no injuries were reported.

==Awards==
KKOB has been awarded four Marconi Awards from the National Association of Broadcasters – one in 1997, &quot;Talk Station of the Year&quot; in 2001, &quot;Medium Market Station of the Year&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Legendary Station&quot; in 2010. The station has received 13 nominations. KKOB was awarded &quot;Station of the Year&quot; honors from &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; magazine in 2009. From the New Mexico Broadcasters Association the station has received numerous awards including &quot;Station of the Year&quot; 13 times since 2000.

<doc id="1248180" wikidata="Q1077801" url="?curid=1248180" title="Chris Taylor (wrestler)">
<text>Christopher J. Taylor (June 13, 1950 – June 30, 1979) was an American super-heavyweight wrestler. He competed in freestyle and Greco-Roman events at the 1972 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal in the freestyle. At 412 pounds (187 kg), he was the heaviest Olympian ever until the appearance of judoka Ricardo Blas Jr. in 2008 (weight limits have since been imposed).

==Amateur wrestling==
The 6 ft 5 in (196 cm) Taylor wrestled for Dowagiac High School in Dowagiac, Michigan and then in college at Muskegon Community College and Iowa State University (winning the NCAA heavyweight championship in 1972 and 1973 by defeating Greg Wojciechowski and Jim Hagen, respectively). Taylor won the bronze medal at the 1972 Olympics in freestyle wrestling. He lost only to Aleksandr Medved. It appeared Medved was stalling, but the referee awarded a point to the Soviet, charging Taylor with a lack of action. Later admitting that he felt sorry for Medved because of Taylor&#x27;s size, the referee was dismissed from the Olympic tournament and banned from international officiating. In the Greco-Roman competition, Taylor was unexpectedly suplexed and pinned by a much lighter Wilfried Dietrich, whom he defeated a week before in the freestyle contest.

==Professional wrestling career==
Taylor wrestled professionally in the American Wrestling Association. His debut was in 1973 vs Rene Goulet. Taylor faced various wrestlers, among them future star Ric Flair. Taylor, trained by Verne Gagne and Billy Robinson, was being groomed to be a major star. Chronic health problems limited the amount of work he could do, and said problems forced him to retire from the ring in 1977. He is often seen in video highlights shown at the AWA training camp, most notably in the WWE DVD releases &quot;The Spectacular Legacy Of the AWA&quot; and &quot;The Definitive Ric Flair Collection&quot;. Also appears in a clip on The Nature Boy, an ESPN 30 for 30 documentary about Ric Flair&#x27;s life. He defeated Flair.

Taylor&#x27;s finishing move was a variation of the bearhug.

==Personal life==
On September 9, 1973, Taylor married Lynn Hart. He died of cardiovascular complications at his home in Story City, Iowa, at the age of 29, two years after health problems caused him to retire from professional wrestling. He is buried in Riverside Cemetery in Dowagiac, Michigan. The couple had one daughter, Jenny Taylor.

**Distinguished Member (Class of 2012)

<doc id="1248188" wikidata="Q1457743" url="?curid=1248188" title="William Chauvenet">
<text>William Chauvenet (24 May 1820 in Milford, Pennsylvania – 13 December 1870 in St. Paul, Minnesota) was a professor of mathematics, astronomy, navigation, and surveying who was instrumental in the establishment of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, and later the second chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis.

== Early life ==
William Chauvenet was born on a farm near Milford, Pennsylvania to Guillaume Marc Chauvenet, a former soldier of Napoleon&#x27;s army who reconverted in silk trade after the Emperor&#x27;s fall, and Mary B. Kerr and was raised in Philadelphia. He entered Yale University at age 16, and graduated in 1840 with high honors. While at Yale, Chauvenet contributed to the school newspaper and was a pianist with the Beethoven Society. He was one of eight founding members of the Skull and Bones Society.

=== United States Navy ===
In 1841, he was appointed a professor of mathematics in the United States Navy, and for a while served on the USS &quot;Mississippi&quot; teaching math. His professorship led Chauvenet to see the necessity of a United States naval academy. While others had proposed the idea, no one had actually seen it through. In 1842, he was appointed head of the naval asylum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At the Naval Asylum, prospective officers took an eight-month course before sailing. Chauvenet felt the course was lacking and drew up his own plan for a two-year course. After being presented to several secretaries of the navy, the course was finally accepted in 1845.

He was instrumental in the 1845 founding of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, and taught there for years. He was president of the academic board and in 1851 was part of a board that recommended the course of study be extended to four years. Chauvenet taught in many subjects, including mathematics, surveying, astronomy, and navigation. He helped to establish an astronomical observatory at the naval academy. Chauvenet&#x27;s contributions were so important that in 1890, Admiral S.R. Franklin proclaimed him &quot;Father of the Naval Academy&quot;. A bronze plaque with this inscription was installed in 1916, at the behest of Congress.

In 1855, he declined Yale&#x27;s offer of a professorship of mathematics to continue working at the Naval Academy in Annapolis.

=== Washington University ===
In 1859, Yale again came calling, offering this time the professorship of astronomy and natural philosophy. Instead, Chauvenet took a job offered by Washington University in St. Louis: professor of mathematics and astronomy. He brought with him a deep love of music and a familiarity with the classics, in addition to being an outstanding figure in the world of science, noted by many historians as one of the foremost mathematical minds in the U.S. before the Civil War. It was Chauvenet who mathematically confirmed James B. Eads&#x27; plans for the first bridge to span the Mississippi River at St. Louis. The directors of the University chose him to be chancellor after his friend and Yale classmate Joseph Hoyt died in 1861. He came to his chancellorship in the midst of the Civil War in a state divided by the question of slavery.

Washington University grew during his chancellorship, adding dozens of professors, hundreds of students, and several new programs, including the law school in 1867. He served as vice president of the United States National Academy of Sciences and president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and was a member of both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Chauvenet authored many treatises and textbooks, including &quot;A Manual of Spherical and Practical Astronomy&quot; and &quot;Theory of the Ribbed Arch&quot;. The 
calculations of Chauvenet and Charles Pfeiffer were used by James Buchanan Eads in designing and building the Eads Bridge in St. Louis.

Chauvenet served as chancellor until his death in 1870. William Greenleaf Eliot, founder of Washington University, succeeded him as chancellor. Chauvenet died in St. Paul, Minnesota, and was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.

==Posthumous honors==
After his death, the Mathematical Association of America established a prestigious prize in his honor, the Chauvenet Prize; the Naval Academy named a mathematics building for him; and the U.S. Navy christened two ships after him, USS Chauvenet (AGS-11) and . The Chauvenet crater on the moon is named after him as well. Mount Chauvenet in the Rocky Mountains is named after him.

<text>Robert Jan &quot;Bob&quot; Ctvrtlik (;
born July 8, 1963) is a retired American volleyball player who is a three-time Olympian, Olympic gold medalist, and a former member of the International Olympic Committee. He is a 1985 graduate of Pepperdine University.

In 2007, Ctvrtlik was inducted into the International Volleyball Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Bob Ctvrtlik was born in Long Beach, California to Margaret and Josef Ctvrtlik. He attended Long Beach Wilson High School in Long Beach.

==Playing career==
===College===
In 1982, Ctvrtlik became a member of the Long Beach City College Vikings volleyball team. He won the state championship and was selected as the MVP of the championship tournament.

In 1983, Ctvrtlik played for Long Beach State and was an All-American. He then transferred to Pepperdine to play his final collegiate year under the leadership and guidance of coaching legend Marv Dunphy, winning the 1985 NCAA title and being selected as the MVP of the tournament. 

In 2009, Ctvrtlik was inducted into the Pepperdine Hall of Fame.

===National team===
After a successful college volleyball career, Ctvrtlik joined the United States national team. He won gold medals at the 1985 FIVB World Cup in Japan and the 1986 FIVB World Championship in France. In the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Ctvrtlik earned a gold medal by helping to defeat the Soviet Union in the finals. In the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, he became one of the national players who shaved their heads in protest of alleged officiating misconduct. The United States defeated Cuba in the consolation match to take home the bronze medal.

After the Barcelona games, Ctvrtlik went to Europe to play in the Italian Club League for Brescia along with fellow Olympian Scott Fortune. He returned to the national team in preparation for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, winning a bronze medal at the 1994 FIVB World Championship in Greece. Ctvrtlik was selected as the Best Player in the World by the International Volleyball Federation in 1995, but the national team would fail to win a medal in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. He was regarded as one of the best serve receivers in the world.

===Beach volleyball===

Ctvrtlik was a beach volleyball player on the professional four-man circuit. He attained the &quot;AAA&quot; beach rating while playing on the two-man circuit.

==After volleyball==
In 1996, Ctvrtlik was elected to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Athlete&#x27;s Commission, and then re-elected for an eight-year term at the 2000 Summer Olympics. He was appointed to the IOC in 1999. He was a founding board member of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), and served on the IOC Reform Committee.

==Personal life==

Ctvrtlik&#x27;s business concerns include real estate rehabilitation projects as president of Green Street Properties, LLC in Huntington Beach, California, and import-exports, via his company, the Ciram Corporation.

Ctvrtlik and his wife Cosette have three sons: Josef, Erik, and Matthew. Matthew played volleyball for Harvard.

Cvrtlik&#x27;s father, Josef, a native of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Moravian region, was a graduate of Charles University in Prague and knew eight languages. He was imprisoned for three months during the German occupation for refusing to serve as a translator. Josef left his country in 1948 by taking a train from Prague to Bratislava, and then skiing to Austria with three friends. After 18 months in West Germany and five years in New Zealand working as a wool buyer, he moved to California in 1955 and worked as a professor at California State University, Long Beach (Long Beach State) before his death in 1983 from colon cancer.

<text>Volcano High () is a 2001 South Korean martial arts action comedy film. It revolves around a troublemaking high school student named Kim Kyung-soo (portrayed by Jang Hyuk) who finds himself transferred to the last school that will take him, the prestigious Volcano High, an institution whose students display an incredible talent in martial arts, with a few demonstrating even more mysterious psychic powers. Kyung-soo is drawn into fights between different clubs, a manuscript that is told to hold great power, and a group of teachers that will do whatever possible to keep the students in line. It was the 9th highest grossing Korean film of 2001 with 1,687,800 admissions nationwide, and had both an original domestic version and edited international version.

== Prologue ==
17 years of feuding, sparked by the Great Teacher&#x27;s Battle, has stripped authorities of their power, as self-indulgence, disguised as self-control, grips the student body. The schools have fallen into disarray. However, there is a legend. The one who acquires the Secret Manuscript will end the chaos. It is a legend that disrupts the Martial Court of Volcano High. Now, in the 108th year of Volcano...

== Plot ==
Having been expelled from previous schools due to the lack of control of his powers, Kyung-soo is determined to graduate and attend Volcano High (the last school who will accept him). On his first day, he doesn&#x27;t fit in due to him being an outsider and the only friends he makes are Shimma and Golbangi, whom the latter warn him of Chae-yi&#x27;s reputation as Icy Jade.

In another room, Hak-rim is seen using his powers to make a tea based antidote for the principal. On his way to deliver the antidote, Hak-rim is able to prevent a fight between Kyung-soo and Jang Ryang (after the latter hated the smell of Fujian Tofu). Reminding the latter that he must not start trouble, Ryang leaves in anger.

Meanwhile, trouble ensues with Vice Principal Hak-sa who is determined to be principal of Volcano High from the former headmaster. Despite his fears of Jang Ryang, Hak-sa enlists his help to frame famed martial arts student, Hak-rim, for stealing an ancient manuscript that is believed to help end the 17 years of feuding. However, he soon runs into several problems after successfully framing and imprisoning Hak-rim. The principal is not only alive, but is in a happy induced coma and adding to Hak-sa&#x27;s problems is that the Dark Oxen gang having taken over the school.

Most students begin to believe Kyung-soo framed Hak-rim, despite his denial and maintaining his innocence. However, Chae-yi believes him and tells her friend, Yo-seon that she suspects Ryang of framing Hak-rim. This is confirmed when Ryang shows up with intentions to make her, his queen so they could rule Volcano High together. Chae-yi refuses the offer and Kyung-soo tries to defend her. During a fight with Ryang, Kyung-soo is able to defeat him, but later is injured temporarily from the whole thing when he becomes distracted with his parents&#x27; plea to behave himself.

During visitation to Hak-rim, Chae-yi and Yo-seon tells him about the incident with Ryang&#x27;s involvement in his framing. He soon begins to sense Kyung-soo is their only chance to restore order to Volcano High and asks them to set up a meeting with him.

Realizing that Ryang could hinder his efforts to take control of Volcano High and prevent him from taking the manuscript, Hak-sa calls forth Mr. Ma and his gang known as the Five Teachers to help him retake control of the school. They succeed and begin punishing the students for minor infractions. Kyung-soo tries to avoid being in trouble at all times, afraid of the shame he could bring to his family if expelled one last time. However, Mr. Ma recognizes him from a previous school and this forces him to fight.

One day, Hak-rim and Kyung-soo meet in visitation. Convinced that he may be the students only chance to bring order into the school once more, Hak-rim trains Kyung-soo to master his powers properly. Although Kyung-soo refuses to be involved, he slowly begins to realize the meaning of Hak-rim&#x27;s warning that he can&#x27;t escape his fate and must help restore order in the school by finding the said manuscript. He begins to master his powers in the boys shower room and accidentally gets Chae-yi wet. However, by this time, she begins to have feelings for him and vice versa.

Ryang is angered by this, but more so with Hak-sa when he discovers what the vice-principal has done in recruiting the Five Teachers. He tries to remind him of their original deal, but Mr. Ma sends him away. Kyung-soo finally fights Mr. Ma during the climax of the film. After a lengthy battle, he is able to defeat Mr. Ma and kill him. Opening the box, Kyung-soo reveals there is no manuscript to the shock of Ryang, Hak-sa and the remaining four teachers. However, the students doesn&#x27;t care because they realized the meaning Hak-rim&#x27;s words about the manuscript being a metaphor and that he knew Kyung-soo was the one who is able to restore order in the school. Hak-sa eventually loses it and the remaining four teachers willingly abandons him after the loss of Mr. Ma.

With that, the charges against Hak-rim are dismissed and he is set free. The principal is back to normal and is able to run the school again. When he mentions his dreams of the manuscript, the students reveal that they know the truth of Hak-rim&#x27;s words of it being a metaphor. The principal asks them about it, the students reveal he knew that Kyung-soo was the one destined to restore order to the school because of his abilities. He able to fight Ryang fairly and win without worry of expulsion. Kyung-soo is able to graduate from high school and make his family proud for once. In the end scenes, Kyung-soo poses with the other clubs in photos. Chae-yi notices Yo-seon writing another letter to Hak-rim and realizes she has feelings for him. She soon advises Yo-seon to tell him of her feelings for him soon. She refuses and continues writing more letters. Hak-sa is seen in the same induced coma after his loss of favor.

<doc id="1248210" wikidata="Q2442059" url="?curid=1248210" title="Queen Elizabeth Hotel">
<text>Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth () is a historic grand hotel in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. With 950 rooms and 21 floors it is the largest hotel in Quebec, and the second largest Fairmont hotel in Canada after the Fairmont Royal York in Toronto. Located at 900 René Lévesque Boulevard West, in Downtown Montreal, it is connected to Central Station and to the underground city. The hotel is known for being the location for John Lennon and Yoko Ono recording &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; in Room 1742 during their 1969 anti-war Bed-In.

==History==
The Queen Elizabeth () opened on April 15, 1958. The hotel was built and owned by the Canadian National Railway and operated by Hilton Hotels International, though it was never branded as a Hilton. 

Canadian National Railway selected leading architects and designers to give the interior decoration a &quot;New France&quot; theme, using Quebec handicrafts. The artists included Albert Edward Cloutier (carved wooden panels), Jean Dallaire (wall hanging), Marius Plamondon (stained glass mural), Claude Vermette (ceramic tiles) and Julien Hébert (bronze elevator doors). Cloutier painted a mural for the main dining room of the Salle Bonaventure in the hotel.

There was controversy over naming the hotel: Quebec nationalists wanted it called Château Maisonneuve in honour of Montreal&#x27;s founder, Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve. CN&#x27;s president, Donald Gordon, insisted it be named for the queen, who had unexpectedly come to the throne in 1952 while the hotel was still on the drawing board.
Many famous guests have stayed there, including Queen Elizabeth II (four times) and the Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Prince Charles, Fidel Castro, who was the first head of state to visit the hotel, Charles de Gaulle, and Princess Grace of Monaco, during Expo &#x27;67, Indira Gandhi, Jacques Chirac, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Sadiq Raji, Mikhail Gorbachev, Jimmy Carter, Henry Kissinger, Perry Como, Joan Crawford, John Travolta, Mikhail Baryshnikov, and George W. Bush.

The hotel reached worldwide fame when John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who had been refused entry into the United States, conducted their Bed-In in Room 1742 at the hotel between May 26 and June 2, 1969. &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; was recorded in this room on June 1 by André Perry. This song is the first solo single issued by Lennon and became an anthem of the American anti-war movement during the 1970s. It peaked at #14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #2 on the British singles chart.

The NHL Entry Draft was also held at the hotel ten times between 1963 and 1979.

In 1970, the Government of Quebec moved its centre of operations into the Queen Elizabeth in the midst of the October Crisis.

CN Hotels assumed direct management of the hotel on January 1, 1984, when the contract with Hilton ended. CN Hotels was sold to Canadian Pacific Hotels in 1988. In 2001, Canadian Pacific Hotels was rebranded as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, following their purchase of that smaller chain. The hotel was renamed Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth.

In 2010, six doormen of the hotel were arrested on charges of racketeering and extortion.

From June 17, 2016, to July 10, 2017, the hotel was closed for a renovation.

<text>Gelsemium is an Asian and North American genus of flowering plants belonging to family Gelsemiaceae. The genus contains three species of shrubs to straggling or twining climbers. Two species are native to North America, and one to China and Southeast Asia.

Carl Linnaeus first classified &quot;G. sempervirens&quot; as &quot;Bignonia sempervirens&quot; in 1753; Antoine Laurent de Jussieu created a new genus for this species in 1789. &quot;Gelsemium&quot; is a Latinized form of the Italian word for jasmine, &quot;gelsomino&quot;. &quot;G. elegans&quot; has the common name &quot;heartbreak grass&quot;.

== Properties ==
All three species of this genus are poisonous.

=== Active components ===
The active components of gelsemium are the alkaloids, which are present in a concentration of about 0.5%. These consist primarily of gelsemine (a highly toxic compound related to strychnine), with lesser amounts of related compounds (gelsemicine, gelsedine, etc). Other compounds found in the plant include scopoletin (also called gelsemic acid), a small amount of volatile oil, fatty acid and tannins.

&quot;Gelsemium&quot; has been shown to contain methoxyindoles.

=== Medicinal uses ===
As late as 1906, a drug called Gelsemium, made from the rhizome and rootlets of &quot;Gelsemium sempervirens&quot;, was used in the treatment of facial and other neuralgias. It also proved valuable in some cases of malarial fever, and was occasionally used as a cardiac depressant and in spasmodic affections, but was inferior for this purpose to other remedies.

== Species ==
== Alleged poisoning victims ==
* On 23 December 2011, Long Liyuan, a Chinese billionaire, died after eating cat stew that was allegedly poisoned with &quot;Gelsemium elegans&quot;.
* On 10 November 2012, Alexander Perepilichny died outside his UK home, after warning of Kremlin death threats he received related to the Magnitsky affair. A lawyer for the deceased&#x27;s life insurance company told a pre-inquest hearing that toxicology reports had identified traces of &quot;Gelsemium&quot; in his body. However, this was later denied by an expert at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, the Police and coroner concluded that he died of natural causes.

== Symptoms of poisoning ==
The poison affects the vision and respiration. Symptoms can appear almost immediately.

===Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s experiment===
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, once administered himself a small amount of gelsemium and kept increasing the amount every day until he could no longer stand the ill effects. In a letter written by him to the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; on 20 September 1879, he described that he had persistent diarrhea, severe frontal headache, and great depression, and therefore stopped his self-experimentation at 200 minims.

===A rare case of &quot;Gelsemium&quot; addiction===
In his classic early 20th century work on psychotropic drugs &quot;Phantastica&quot;, German pharmacologist Louis Lewin recounts the seemingly unique case of a person who became addicted (in a manner far more often associated with opiates) to a &quot;Gelsemium&quot; preparation:
 during a severe attack of rheumatism a man took a large quantity of an alcoholic tincture of &quot;Gelsemium sempervirens&quot; a plant which is liable to act on the brain and the medulla oblongata. Noticing an appreciable result he continued to take it, and finally became a slave to the drug. He gradually augmented the quantity, and reached 30 gr. of the tincture in one dose. Slowly he became pale, agitated, and discontented. He wasted away. Hallucination set in, and his state grew worse until disorders of the intelligence appeared. As he continued to increase the doses he fell into idiocy and died in a state of mental confusion.

<text>A rocket docket is a court or other tribunal that is noted for its speedy disposition of cases and controversies that come before it, often by maintaining strict adherence to the law as pertains to filing deadlines, etc.

The term was originally applied to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, after Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr., who ran the federal courthouse in Alexandria, decided that justice was being dispensed too slowly for his liking. The court earned the nickname among attorneys practicing there in the 1970s, who told stories of Bryan ruling on the spot when motions were argued, and trying entire cases in one afternoon. As of September 2011, the Eastern District of Virginia had the shortest average time from filing to disposition for civil cases that went to trial (at 12.1 months) and was second (behind the Eastern District of Pennsylvania) in median time for resolution of all civil cases.

Later the term was applied to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Other jurisdictions that have been characterized as rocket dockets include the United States District Court for the Northern District of California; the United States District Court for the Southern District of California; the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia; and the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.

The U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office has designated its expedited examination of design patent applications as a rocket docket.

In Jefferson County (Louisville), Kentucky a team of prosecutors is assigned to the Progressive Criminal Justice Plan, referred to as the &quot;rocket docket,&quot; for speedy resolution of certain criminal matters.

Another notable &quot;rocket docket&quot; court involved Lee County, Florida (Fort Myers), home of numerous foreclosure proceedings due to the collapse of the Florida housing market as a result of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, part of the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis. On some days, the court heard up to 1,000 cases per day; assuming an 8-hour day, this equates to less than 30 seconds per case. The entire case frequently consists of two questions: whether the homeowner is behind on payments, and whether they are still in the house. If yes, the judge allows the homeowner 60 days to come to an agreement with the bank for payments or lose the house.

<doc id="1248241" wikidata="Q20811337" url="?curid=1248241" title="Corcoran (surname)">
<text>Corcoran is an Irish surname, the original Irish language form being meaning &#x27;descendant of Corcrán&#x27; and MacCorcráin from Leinster meaning Son of Corcrán. The name itself is derived from meaning &#x27;purple&#x27;.

== History ==
The name Corcoran is an anglicisation of the names of two Gaelic clans. The first was the Ó Corcráin in Ulster. The second was the MacCorcráin clan from Leinster, which was a sept of Ó Corcráin.
Related variations of the name Corcoran historically include &quot;MacCorcoran&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Corcoran&quot;, and &quot;Corcorran&quot;. The Corcorans were predominantly from Fermanagh and included a number of figures of historical importance such as the Bishop of Clogher in 1370 and Edmund O&#x27;Corcoran, &quot;the hero of Limerick&quot; (from the siege of 1691).
Many Corcorans become members of the clergy between the tenth and fifteenth centuries; they became based around the vicinity of Lough Erne, County Fermanagh in Ulster. One member of the family, John Corcoran, was appointed Bishop of Clogher in 1373.

The O&#x27;Corcrain territory was invaded by the Normans in 1170 AD.

During the Plantation of Ulster and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649 AD, the Corcorans were scattered. Many settled on lands in Connaught, Munster and Leinster. Principally Offaly, Tipperary and Galway where the MacCorcorans had settled previously.

<doc id="1248243" wikidata="Q256998" url="?curid=1248243" title="Jean-Hilaire Aubame">
<text>Jean-Hilaire Aubame (10 November 1912 – 18 August 1989) was a Gabonese politician active during both the colonial and independence periods. The French journalist Pierre Péan said that Aubame&#x27;s training &quot;as a practicing Catholic and a customs official helped to make him an integrated man, one of whom political power was not an end in itself.&quot;

Born into a Fang family, Aubame was orphaned at a young age. He was raised by the stepbrother of Léon M&#x27;ba, who became Aubame&#x27;s chief political rival. Encouraged by his colleagues, Aubame entered politics, serving as Gabon&#x27;s first representative in the National Assembly of France from 1946 to 1958. Aubame was also a leader in solving African problems, particularly developing the Gabonese standard of living and planning urban sites. Aubame&#x27;s quick rise in Gabonese politics was spurred by the support of the missions and administration, whereas much of M&#x27;ba&#x27;s strength came from the colonists.

Despite a rivalry, Aubame and M&#x27;ba, now the President of Gabon, formed several political unions which were sufficiently politically balanced to appeal to the electorate. In appreciation for his help, M&#x27;ba appointed Aubame as foreign minister and later President of the Supreme Court. Tensions soon rose between the two due to Aubame&#x27;s refusal to merge his party with M&#x27;ba&#x27;s and create a one-party state. Aubame was installed as President of Gabon during a 1964 coup d&#x27;état against M&#x27;ba. However, the coup was toppled three days later, and although he did not participate in the coup&#x27;s planning, Aubame was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile. He was beaten almost daily by his prison guards while serving out his sentence. M&#x27;ba&#x27;s successor as President, Omar Bongo, allowed the return of Aubame to Gabon in 1972. The elder politician died in 1989 in Gabon&#x27;s capital of Libreville.

==Youth and early political career==

Born into a Fang family near Libreville, Aubame lost his father at eight years of age and his mother at eleven. Abbé Jean Obame, stepbrother of Léon M&#x27;ba, looked after the orphaned Aubame and arranged for schooling at several Roman Catholic missions. After he graduated, Aubame became a schoolteacher.

M&#x27;ba helped get him a job in customs on 24 March 1931. First appointed to Libreville from 1931 to 1935, he was transferred to Bangui in 1935 and then to Brazzaville in 1936, where he co-founded a branch of the Mutuelle Gabonaise with a brother of politician Louis Bigmann. He was also a member of the Association des fonctionnaires, an organization which was dominated by two other soon-to-be politicians: René-Paul Sousatte and Jean Rémy Ayouné.

Following the speech given by Charles de Gaulle on the Appeal of 18 June 1940, Aubame sided with the Free French, and in November was sent by Libreville authorities to rally Fangs for the cause. In February 1942, Aubame met colonial administrator Félix Éboué and quickly became his protégé. He served as an informant for Éboué on African affairs. Aubame&#x27;s reward was to be one of several Africans promoted on 23 February 1943 into the European section of the civil service, and on 1 January 1944 Éboué appointed him president of the municipal commission for the Poto-Poto section of Brazzaville.

Aubame participated in the 1944 Brazzaville Conference and served in this post until 10 November 1946. After Éboué&#x27;s sudden death in March 1944, Aubame worked as an adviser to Governor-General André Bayardelle and his secretary André Soucadoux. They encouraged Aubame to run for office, and he returned to Gabon to campaign with the support of both the administration and the missionaries.

==Deputy==

===Deputy to the French National Assembly===
Aubame lost in the 1945 elections, though on 10 November 1946 became Gabon&#x27;s first representative to the French National Assembly by winning 7,069 votes out of 12,528 possible. From 1946 to 1951 he was Commissioner of shipping, the press, communication, labor and social security. He voted for Algerian independence on 27 August 1947 and for the establishment of a Council of Europe on 9 July 1949.

On 17 June 1951, Aubame was reelected a deputy with 17,329 votes out of a total of 29,203 and on 2 January 1956 with 26,712 votes out of a total of 57,031, with this term lasting until the end of the Fourth French Republic. Around this time, M&#x27;ba was establishing his political career after being exiled to Oubangui-Chari. Affiliating with the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO), Aubame later worked most closely with the Indépendants d&#x27;Outre-Mer, an African parliamentary group whose leaders were Senegalese Léopold Sédar Senghor and Cameroonian Louis-Paul Aujoulat. While a deputy he lived in Paris and toured Gabon regularly.

He continued to develop local Gabonese politics, in particular revitalizing the Fang clans. In fact, M&#x27;ba asserted that Aubame was too involved with the Fang to pay attention to the interests of the southern tribes, a charge Aubame ridiculed. Aubame was also a leader in solving African problems, particularly developing the Gabonese standard of living and planning urban sites. On 29 September 1951, he voted to increase the minimum wage in the overseas territories of France, and served as vice president of its Commission from 1953 to 1955. He organized the Gabonese Democratic and Social Union (UDSG) in 1947, whose leadership came mostly from the interior, particularly Woleu-Ntem Province. The party in turn backed Aubame&#x27;s reelection in 1951 and 1956. It had few philosophical differences with the M&#x27;ba-led Bloc Démocratique Gabonais (BDG), including advocating less economic dependence on France and faster &quot;Africanization&quot; of French political jobs. Fairly quickly, Gabonese politics became dominated by Aubame, supported by the missions and the administration, and M&#x27;ba, supported by the settlers.

===Deputy to the Gabonese Territorial Assembly===
In 1952 he was elected as Woleu-N&#x27;Tem&#x27;s representative for Gabon&#x27;s Territorial Assembly. He was re-elected in the March 1957 elections, in which the UDSG also placed first, winning 18 of the 40 contested seats, against 16 for BDG. M&#x27;ba&#x27;s party won 21 seats against 19 for Aubame&#x27;s party after a recount. However, in the absence of an absolute majority, on 21 May 1957, both parties were obligated to submit a list of individuals that both agreed were suitable for inclusion in the government. That same day, M&#x27;ba was appointed vice president of the government. Soon, divisions within the government grew, and Aubame resigned from his position and filed a motion of censure against the government. The motion was rejected by a 21–19 vote. With M&#x27;ba&#x27;s victory, many elected UDSG members joined the parliamentary majority, giving the ruling government 29 of the 40 legislative seats. Well installed in the government, he slowly began to reinforce his power.

== Independence and opposition ==

=== Opposition leader ===

After voting in favor of the Franco-African Community constitutional referendum of 28 September 1958, Gabon became pseudo-politically independent. Legislative elections were scheduled for 19 June 1960 through the Scrutin de Liste voting system, a form of bloc voting in which each party offers a list of candidates who the population vote for; the list that obtains a majority of votes is declared the winner and wins all the contested seats. Through the redistricting of district and constituency boundaries, the BDG arbitrarily received 244 seats, while the UDSG received 77. In the months that followed, the legislative majority was plagued by internal strife. M&#x27;ba, now President of Gabon, decided to dissolve the Assembly and looked to the opposition to strengthen his position.

With Aubame, he formed a number of sufficiently balanced political unions to appeal to the electorate. On 12 February, they won 99.75% of the vote, and later that day, M&#x27;ba, running unopposed, was elected president of Gabon. For his cooperation, M&#x27;ba appointed Aubame foreign minister, replacing André Gustave Anguilé. In contrast to M&#x27;ba who wanted a strong executive regime, Aubame preferred a parliamentary republic. Tensions rose when a new constitution was unanimously adopted, on 21 February 1961, providing for a &quot;hyperprésidentiel&quot; regime. Under this system, M&#x27;ba was able to appoint ministers whose functions and limitations were decided by him.

On 19 February, he broke his ties with Aubame; all UDSG representatives were dismissed, with the exception of M&#x27;ba supporter Francis Meye. This was due to Aubame&#x27;s refusal to merge the UDSG with M&#x27;ba&#x27;s and create a one-party state. In an attempt to oust Aubame from his legislative seat, M&#x27;ba appointed him President of the Supreme Court on 25 February. Thereafter, M&#x27;ba claimed that Aubame had resigned from the National Assembly, citing incompatibility with parliamentary functions. Aubame resolved the accusation by resigning from his post as President of the Supreme Court, complicating matters for M&#x27;ba. Faced with reports of tension between the government and the National Assembly, even though 70% of its composition were BDG members, the Gabonese president dissolved the legislature on 21 January 1964 as an &quot;economy measure&quot;.

The electoral conditions were announced as such: The election 67 districts were reduced to 47. M&#x27;ba disqualified Aubame by announcing no one who held a post recently was banned. Any party would have to submit 47 candidates who had to pay US$160 or none at all. Thus, over US$7,500 would be deposited without considering campaign expenses. M&#x27;ba&#x27;s idea was that no party other than his would have the money to enter candidates. In response to this, the opposition announced its refusal to participate in elections that they did not consider fair.

It is unlikely that Aubame participated in the planning of the 1964 Gabon coup d&#x27;état. It appears that he joined the effort after being recruited by the new government. His nephew, Pierre Eyeguet, a former ambassador to the United Kingdom, may have known of the plot beforehand and notified his uncle, although it is unknown whether or not Aubame established contact with the plotters.

===1964 Gabon coup d&#x27;état===
During the night of 17 February and the early morning of 18 February 1964, 150 members of the Gabonese military, gendarmerie, and police, headed by Lieutenant Jacques Mombo and Valére Essone, seized the presidential palace. They arrested President of the National Assembly Louis Bigmann, French commanders Claude Haulin and Major Royer, several ministers, and President M&#x27;ba, who was dragged from his bed at gunpoint. On Radio Libreville, the military announced to the Gabonese people that a coup d&#x27;état had taken place, and that they required technical assistance and told the French not interfere in this matter. M&#x27;ba was instructed to broadcast a speech acknowledging his defeat. &quot;The D-Day is here, the injustices are beyond measure, these people are patient, but their patience has limits&quot;, he said. &quot;It came to a boil.&quot;

During these events, no gunshots were fired. The people did not react strongly, which according to the military, was a sign of approval. A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout. As for the coup plotters, they were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.

Aubame was unaware of the coup until the French ambassador to Gabon, Paul Cousseran, called him on the telephone roughly a half hour after sunrise. Cousseran, meanwhile, was awoken by the noisy streets and checked to see what was happening. Aubame replied that he was to find out why there was &quot;no government&quot;, as Cousseran never directly mentioned a coup. However, about midway through the morning an automobile carrying the revolutionary committee arrived at Aubame&#x27;s residence and drove him to the governmental offices, where he had been named president.

Second Lieutenant Ndo Edou gave instructions to transfer M&#x27;ba to Ndjolé, Aubame&#x27;s electoral stronghold. However, due to heavy rain, the deposed president and his captors took shelter in an unknown village. The next morning they decided to take him over the easier road to Lambaréné. Several hours later, they returned to Libreville. The new head of government quickly contacted French ambassador Paul Cousseran, to assure him that the property of foreign nationals would be protected and to ask him to prevent any French military intervention.

In Paris, French president Charles de Gaulle decided otherwise. M&#x27;ba was one of the most loyal allies to France in Africa. While visiting France in 1961, M&#x27;ba said: &quot;[a]ll Gabonese have two fatherlands: France and Gabon.&quot; Moreover, under his regime, Europeans enjoyed particularly friendly treatment. Therefore, President de Gaulle, upon advice from his chief adviser on African policy, Jacques Foccart, decided that he would restore the legitimate government. This was in accordance with a 1960 treaty between Gabon and the French, which was ironically signed by Aubame in his stint as Foreign Minister. Intervention could not commence without a formal request to the Head of State of Gabon. Since M&#x27;ba was otherwise occupied, the French contacted the Vice President of Gabon, Paul-Marie Yembit, who had not been arrested. However, he remained unaccounted for; therefore, they decided to compose a predated letter that Yembit would later sign, confirming their intervention. Less than 24 hours later, French troops stationed in Dakar and Brazzaville landed in Libreville and restored M&#x27;ba to power. Over the course of the operation, one French soldier was killed, while 15 to 25 died on the Gabonese side.

==Trial at Lambaréné==
Aubame and Gondjout fled Libreville as fugitives, though were eventually discovered. In August, the trial of the military rebels and provisional government was opened in Lambaréné. A &quot;state of precations&quot; was enacted, which decreed that the local government maintained surveillance over suspected troublemakers and, if necessary, order a curfew. Special permits were required to travel through the town. The trial was held in a school building overlooking the Ogooue River, near Albert Schweitzer&#x27;s hospital. Space was limited, so there was no representative section of the public. One needed a permit to witness the trial, and family members were restricted to one each. Press coverage was limited, and journalists were only allowed if they were representing a high-profile news agency. In addition, there were restrictions on the defence of the accused.

The prosecution called 64 witnesses to the trial. Essone, Mbene, and Aubame claimed that their involvement in the coup was due to a lack of development in the Gabonese army. Judge Leon Auge, the judge in the case, said that if &quot;that is the only reason for your coup d&#x27;état, you deserve a severe penalty.&quot; Aubame affirmed his position that he did not participate in its planning. According to him, he formed the provisional government in a constitutional manner, at the request of some &quot;putschists&quot;. He stated that the French intervention was an illegal act of interference, an assertion that Gondjout and Jean Mare Ekoh, a former education minister, shared.

On 9 September, the judge came to a verdict without consulting M&#x27;ba. Aubame was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile on a remote island off Settecama, down the coast of Gabon, as were most criminals of the case. He was not particularly popular during his political career, though according to &quot;Time&quot;, his arrest &quot;ballooned him to heroic proportions in the eyes of the aroused public&quot;. While serving his 10 years of labor, he was beaten regularly by prison guards. Besides Aubame, M&#x27;ba imprisoned more than 150 of his opponents, most of whom were sentenced to 20 years of hard labor. The actor and the doctor were given 10 years of imprisonment each. While appealing for peace on 18 February, he pledged &quot;no pardon or pity&quot; to his enemies, but rather &quot;total punishment&quot;.

==Later life==
M&#x27;ba&#x27;s successor as President, Omar Bongo, allowed the return of Aubame to Gabon in 1972. Afterward, Aubame lived in Paris and removed himself from the world of politics. He did visit Libreville in 1981, on which occasion Bongo appointed him &quot;special adviser&quot;—a mostly honorary post. Although not a supporter of the Movement for National Renewal (MORENA), his home was bombed on 12 December 1984 by anti-MORENA extremists. Aubame and his family barely escaped harm.

Aubame, whom journalist Ronald Matthews described as having &quot;a curiously harsh voice, a severe appearance, and... a stern character&quot;, died in 1989 in Libreville. The French journalist Pierre Péan said that Aubame&#x27;s training &quot;as a practicing Catholic and a customs official helped to make him an integrated man, one of whom political power was not an end in itself.&quot; Michael C. Reed speculates that, had Aubame become president instead of M&#x27;ba, he might have made the country more democratic. After his death, a Libreville high school was established in his name.

<doc id="1248245" wikidata="Q388423" url="?curid=1248245" title="Hana Highway">
<text>The Hana Highway (colloquially referred to as The Road to Hana) is a stretch of Hawaii Routes 36 and 360 which connects Kahului to the town of Hana in east Maui. To the east of Kalepa Bridge, the highway continues to Kipahulu as Hawaii Route 31 (the Piilani Highway). Although Hana is only about from Kahului, an uninterrupted car-trip takes about 2.5 hours to drive, since the highway is very winding, narrow, and passes over 59 bridges, of which 46 are only one lane wide. There are approximately 620 curves along Route 360 from just east of Kahului to Hana, almost all of it through lush, tropical rainforest. Many of the concrete and steel bridges date back to 1910 and all but one are still in use. That one bridge, badly damaged by erosion, has been replaced by a portable steel ACROW or Bailey bridge erected by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

In August 2000, the highway was designated as the Hana Millennium Legacy Trail by President Bill Clinton, with the trail start designated in Pāia. The Hana Highway was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 15, 2001.

== Route description ==
Hana Highway consists of Hawaii Routes 36 and 360. Route 36 is a mixture of urban street, divided highway, and high-speed rural highway. Route 360 is a narrow and winding mountain road. Mileposts in tourist guides refer to mile markers on Route 360, not Route 36.

Route 36 begins in Kahului and the junction of Routes 32 and 311, and the road named Hana Highway begins one block east. The highway runs east as a four-lane divided highway, intersecting with Routes 380, 3800 which serve Kahului Airport to the north and connect to Maalaea and West Maui to the south. A short distance east, it intersects Route 37, which serves Haleakala to the south. East of this point, the highway becomes a two-lane rural highway, passing through Pa&#x27;ia and Ha&#x27;iku. Highway 36 ends at Route 365 east of Haiku, while the Hana Highway continues as Route 360.

Highway 360 is a narrow, winding, and low speed mountain highway. Its initial junction is marked as Mile Zero at Route 36, and the highway runs in a southeasterly direction toward Hana. This highway includes numerous one-lane stretches of roadway, including one-lane bridges. The road provides access to the community of Keanae, Wailua, and Nahiku, arriving at Hana at mile 34. The highway then turns to the west and continues as Route 31.

==Tourism==
The Hana Highway is a popular tourist attraction in Maui. Guidebooks often devote large sections to traveling the highway leading to the eastern side of Maui, documenting the many waterfalls and attractions that can be found along the way. Some of these attractions lie within or through private property and will often have &quot;no trespassing&quot; signs posted or even signs claiming that the attraction does not exist. All beaches in Hawaii are public. Some guidebooks document the &quot;keep out&quot; areas and ways past barbed wire fences and locked gates to reach attractions.

Beyond the town of Hana, the Hana Highway becomes Hawaii State Road 330 and leads to the Oheo Gulch where the Seven Sacred Pools are located within the Kipahulu Area of the Haleakala National Park.

Occasionally the dirt road past Route 31 is closed to traffic due to landslides.

Scenic turnouts abound, including one for Wailua Falls near the Seven Sacred Pools in Oheo.

==History==
In the sixteenth century, Maui&#x27;s King Pi&#x27;ilani conquered East Maui and drew Hana into his political sphere. Pi&#x27;ilani built the Alaloa, the &quot;long road,&quot; from West Maui, a road on which travelers reportedly swung themselves over East Maui&#x27;s rushing streams with ropes made of vines. Later, Piilani&#x27;s son, Kihapiilani, extended the Alaloa into the Hana District. When completed, the road was wide, , and paved with hand-fitted basalt (lava) rocks.
Modern road construction to Hana began in the 1870s, with an unpaved road built to facilitate the construction of the Hämäkua Ditch. Part of The East Maui Irrigation System, the Hämäkua Ditch brought water from the rainforests of Haleakalā to semi-arid central Maui to support the sugarcane industry.

Road construction continued in the early 1900s and was extended piecemeal until the full road to Hana was officially opened on December 18, 1926. Construction of bridges continued through the 1930s and the road was not completely paved until the 1960s.

<doc id="1248251" wikidata="Q1136969" url="?curid=1248251" title="Coulomb explosion">
<text>A Coulombic explosion is a condensed-matter physics process in which a molecule or crystal lattice is destroyed by the Coulombic repulsion between its constituent atoms. Coulombic explosions are a prominent technique in laser-based machining, and appear naturally in certain high-energy reactions.

==Mechanism==
A Coulombic explosion begins when an intense electric field (often from a laser) excites the valence electrons in a solid, ejecting them from the system and leaving behind positively charged ions. The chemical bonds holding the solid together are weakened by the loss of the electrons, enabling the Coulombic repulsion between the ions to overcome them. The result is an explosion of ions and electrons – a plasma.

The laser must be very intense to produce a Coulomb explosion. If it is too weak, the energy given to the electrons will be transferred to the ions via electron-phonon coupling. This will cause the entire material to heat up, melt, and thermally ablate away as a plasma. The end result is similar to Coulomb explosion, except that any fine structure in the material will be damaged by thermal melting.

It may be shown that the Coulomb explosion occurs in the same parameter regime as the superradiant phase transition i.e. when the destabilizing interactions become overwhelming and dominate over the oscillatory phonon-solid binding motions.

==Technological use==
A Coulomb explosion is a &quot;cold&quot; alternative to the dominant laser etching technique of thermal ablation, which depends on local heating, melting, and vaporization of molecules and atoms using less-intense beams. Pulse brevity down only to the nanosecond regime is sufficient to localize thermal ablation – before the heat is conducted far, the energy input (pulse) has ended. Nevertheless, thermally ablated materials may seal pores important in catalysis or battery operation, and recrystallize or even burn the substrate, thus changing the physical and chemical properties at the etch site. In contrast, even light foams remain unsealed after ablation by Coulomb explosion.

Coulomb explosions for industrial machining are made with ultra-short (picosecond or femtoseconds) laser pulses. The enormous beam intensities required (10–400 terawatt per square centimeter thresholds, depending on material) are only practical to generate, shape, and deliver for very brief instants of time. Coulomb explosion etching can be used in any material to bore holes, remove surface layers, and texture and microstructure surfaces; e.g., to control ink loading in printing presses.

==Appearance in nature==
High speed camera imaging of alkali metals exploding in water has suggested the explosion is a coulomb explosion.

During a nuclear explosion based on the fission of uranium, 167 MeV is emitted in the form of a coulombic explosion between each prior nucleus of uranium, the repulsive electrostatic energy between the two fission daughter nuclei, translates into the kinetic energy of the fission products that results in both the primary driver of the blackbody radiation that rapidly generates the hot dense plasma/nuclear fireball formation and thus also both later blast and thermal effects.

Scientists at the University of Cologne Zoological Institute have suggested that coulomb explosion (specifically, the electrostatic repulsion of dissociated carboxyl groups of polyglutamic acid) may be part of the explosive action of nematocytes, the stinging cells in aquatic organisms of the phylum Cnidaria.

==Coulomb explosion imaging==

Molecules are held together by a balance of charge between negative electrons and positive nuclei. When multiple electrons are expelled, either by laser irradiation or bombardment using highly charged ions, the remaining, mutually repulsive, nuclei fly apart in a Coulomb explosion. The structure of simple gas phase molecules can be determined by imaging which tracks the fragment trajectories. As of 2022 the method can work with up to 11-atom molecules.

<doc id="1248255" wikidata="Q748011" url="?curid=1248255" title="New Zealand Knights FC">
<text>New Zealand Knights Football Club (formed from the [[Football Kingz FC|Football Kingz Football Club]] in 2004) were the only professional association football club in New Zealand before they became defunct. Based in Auckland, New Zealand, they played in the A-League, Australia&#x27;s premier football competition and have since been replaced by Wellington Phoenix.

==History==
===Kingz and the NSL 1999–2004===
Football Kingz FC (promoted as &quot;Auckland Kingz&quot; within Australia) joined the Australian National Soccer League in 1999 and proceeded to play in the last five seasons of the NSL, failing to qualify for the playoffs in every season. The club was originally to use the spelling of &quot;Kings&quot;, however this was changed to the Kingz after receiving legal threats from the Sydney Kings basketball franchise.

====Restructuring Football Kingz into New Zealand Knights====
The Football Kingz brand was disestablished in 2004 and was restructured into the New Zealand Knights as a new franchise for Australia&#x27;s new national football competition called the A-League. Market research carried out by the club, to determine the viability of a new identity for the team, indicated that 76% of respondents were in favour of a name change. When that research was focused on those aged 35 and under, the percentage in favour of a change rose to 90%. Further to that, the name of &quot;Knights&quot; were polled best of all names suggested in the survey, a clear 30% higher than any other option.

The former Football Kingz FC General manager Guy Hedderwick was promoted to the role of New Zealand Knights chief executive officer. Alongside him Football Kingz and Waitakere City Chairman, Anthony Lee, became the New Zealand Knights Chairman in the restructuring.

Initially Anthony Lee had invested into the New Zealand Knights, with his company&#x27;s (Total Football Ltd) 20% shareholding second only to majority owner Brian Katzen&#x27;s Octagon Sport (later included Maurice Cox as partner) with 60%. The other shareholders were Sky Television (5%), Chris Turner (10%), and New Zealand Soccer (non-cash 5%).

The only major sponsor the club had was retailer Zero&#x27;s New Zealand (Sub Sandwiches). They agreed to a deal with the Knights over the first three seasons in a six figure deal as a sleeve sponsor.

New Zealand Knights was confirmed as one of the eight founding teams in the A-League.John Adshead, who took the New Zealand national side, the All Whites to their first ever World Cup finals appearance in 1982 was named their inaugural manager/coach. former New Zealand international, Danny Hay, who previously played in the English Premiership with Leeds United was named the inaugural captain of the team.

===New Zealand Knights A-League seasons 2005–2007===
Despite having a squad boasting several players with extensive experience in English football, many pundits did not rate the Knights as serious contenders for the A-League title, and they were considered favourites for the wooden spoon. These predictions turned out to be true, with New Zealand Knights proving to be well out of their depth in their debut A-League season.

In April 2006, after the poor season, manager John Adshead resigned from the club. Paul Nevin was confirmed as manager a month later, having worked as caretaker manager since the position was vacated by Adshead.

In late October 2006, as a result of low crowd attendance at North Harbour Stadium in Auckland and continual poor on-field performances, rumours began to circulate that Football Federation Australia (FFA) was considering the possibility of revoking the Knights&#x27; A-League licence and granting it to a new team that would be set to enter the competition in the 2007–08 season.

On 15 November, nearing the end of the transfer window, the board and management decided to relieve Paul Nevin of his coaching duties due to a string of poor performances.

On 13 December 2006, strong rumours resurfaced that the FFA was considering the revocation of the Knights&#x27; licence to compete in the A-League. It quickly became clear that, with five weeks remaining in the current season, the FFA fully intended to reclaim the licence from the Knights. The FFA had continued to express angst at low attendance numbers, poor on-field performance and the lack of domestically developed players.

Late on 14 December, the FFA announced that it had revoked the competition licence held by the Knights&#x27; owners. An arrangement with NZ Soccer would see the national body step in to manage the club for the remaining five weeks of the regular season, with former All Whites player Ricki Herbert to fill the role of head coach.

Effectively, the Knights dissolved on 21 January, when the final match of the season was played against Perth Glory FC.

On 19 March 2007 after several delays, Wellington Phoenix was selected as the successor to the New Zealand Knights.

====A-League Seasonal Results====

==Stadium==

North Harbour Stadium is a rectangular stadium situated in Albany on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore in New Zealand. It was opened in 1997 after nearly a decade of discussion, planning and construction.

North Harbour Stadium has four main seating areas with an official capacity of 25,000. 19,000 (76%) of this capacity is seated, and the other 6,000 are on grass embankments.

*Main Grandstand — A futuristic looking structure with a distinctive arched roof. It has three main tiers of seating, as well as a row of corporate boxes and several corporate lounges. A total of 12,000 can be seated, mostly under the roof. This is on the southern side of the ground.
*Open Stand — A single uncovered tier opposite the Main Grandstand that can seat 7,000.
*Embankments — At either end (East/West) of the ground, there is a single-tier grass embankment with a capacity of 3,000 people. The scoreboard is at the Western End, while the replay screen is directly opposite.

The stadium is lit with four 45 m tall light towers.

==Colours and badge==
The Knights played in all-black strips, with a silver left sleeve. The change strip was white, with black shorts and white socks.

The badge was designed for the inaugural 2005–06 season and launched at the January 2005 press conference which highlighted the club name change.

==Supporters==
The New Zealand Knights supporter base was known as Bloc 5.

==Auckland&#x27;s return to A-League==
In spite of the fate of the Football Kingz FC and New Zealand Knights, there was ongoing hope within Auckland football community for a possible return for the New Zealand Knights, or another Auckland-based team, to re-join the A-League. Encouraging crowds of 20,078 in November 2011 when Wellington Phoenix played Adelaide United and 11,566 in January 2013 when Wellington Phoenix played Perth Glory, both held at Eden Park, added to the push for the addition of a second New Zealand team in the A-League.

In March 2023 the Australian Professional Leagues, the governing body for the A-League Men, confirmed plans for expansion with new teams to be based in Canberra and Auckland. Bill Foley, the founder of the Black Knight Football Club, which owns Premier League club AFC Bournemouth in the Premier League and a significant interest in FC Lorient and owner of the US National Hockey League team’s Vegas Golden Knights was awarded the Auckland licence. His team, Auckland FC began competing from the 2024–25 A-League season.

<text>Callistemon is a genus of shrubs in the family Myrtaceae, first described as a genus in 1814. The entire genus is endemic to Australia but widely cultivated in many other regions and naturalised in scattered locations. Their status as a separate taxon is in doubt, some authorities accepting that the difference between callistemons and melaleucas is not sufficient for them to be grouped in a separate genus.

==Description==
&quot;Callistemon&quot; species have commonly been referred to as bottlebrushes because of their cylindrical, brush like flowers resembling a traditional bottle brush. They are mostly found in the more temperate regions of Australia, especially along the east coast and typically favour moist conditions so when planted in gardens thrive on regular watering. However, two species are found in Tasmania and several others in the south-west of Western Australia. At least some species are drought-resistant and some are used in ornamental landscaping elsewhere in the world.


==Taxonomy==
The Latin name &quot;Callistemon&quot; comes from the combination of 2 Greek words of &#x27;callis&#x27; meaning beauty and &#x27;stemon&#x27; meaning stamen, referring to the flowers of the plant.

The genus &quot;Callistemon&quot; was first formally described in 1814 by Robert Brown. In his description he noted that the genus includes “those species of &quot;Metrosideros&quot; that have inflorescence similar to that of &quot;Melaleuca&quot;, and distinct elongated filaments.” Carl Linnaeus had described the genus &quot;Melaleuca&quot; in 1767 and in 1867, George Bentham brought all the &quot;Metrosideros&quot; species into &quot;Melaleuca&quot;. Bentham described melaleucas as having stamens united in bundles opposite the (five) petals.

In his 1864 description of &quot;Callistemon salignus&quot; in &quot;Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae&quot;, Ferdinand von Mueller noted that the difference between the genera was “entirely artificial” (“omnino artificiale&quot;). George Bentham also noted in &quot;Flora Australiensis&quot; that &quot;Callistemon&quot; “passes gradually into &quot;Melaleuca&quot;, with which F. Mueller proposes to unite it.” In 1876, Henri Ernest Baillon proposed in &quot;Histoire des Plantes&quot; that &quot;Callistemon&quot;, as well as &quot;Calothamnus&quot; and &quot;Lamarchea&quot; be merged into &quot;Melaleuca&quot;.

Nevertheless, most authors had preserved the distinction between the two genera &quot;Callistemon&quot; and &quot;Melaleuca&quot; until 1998. In that year, in recognition of the fact that the callistemons and melaleucas on New Caledonia were clearly related, Lyndley Craven and J.W. Dawson transferred the callistemons on that island to &quot;Melaleuca&quot;, even though some (e.g. &quot;Melaleuca pancheri&quot;) do not have stamens fused in 5 groups.

On the basis of DNA evidence, in 2006 and 2009 Craven moved all but four callistemons to melaleuca. Those four were &quot;Callistemon forresterae&quot;, &quot;Callistemon genofluvialis&quot;, &quot;Callistemon kenmorrisonii&quot; and &quot;Callistemon nyallingensis&quot; which were regarded as being hybrids.

The new description of &quot;Melaleuca&quot; has been accepted by some herbaria but not all. For example, the Queensland Herbarium accepts &quot;Melaleuca flammea&quot; (synonym &quot;Callistemon acuminatus&quot;) but the New South Wales Herbarium accepts &quot;Callistemon acuminatus&quot;. In 2012, Frank Udovicic and Roger Spencer transferred the newly described species of melaleuca with separate stamens (e.g. &quot;Melaleuca megalongensis&quot; and &quot;Melaleuca wimmerensis&quot;) to &quot;Callistemon&quot; (hence &quot;Callistemon megalongensis&quot; and &quot;Callistemon wimmerensis&quot;). Their argument is that using the DNA evidence is premature. They further argue that if all the genera &quot;Beaufortia&quot;, &quot;Callistemon&quot;, &quot;Calothamnus&quot;, &quot;Conothamnus&quot;, &quot;Eremaea&quot;, &quot;Melaleuca&quot;, &quot;Phymatocarpus&quot; were combined (as Craven has suggested), then there would be no characteristics that would define the group.

==Use in horticulture==
Many commercial nurseries continue to use the name ‘’Callistemon’’. These species can be propagated either by cuttings (some species more easily than others), or from the seeds. Flowering is normally in spring and early summer (October–December), but conditions may cause flowering at other times of the year. The obvious parts of the flower masses are stamens, with the pollen at the tip of the filament; the petals are inconspicuous (see picture). Flower heads vary in colour with species; most are red, but some are yellow, green, orange, pink or white. Each flower head produces a profusion of triple-celled seed capsules around a stem (see picture) which remain on the plant with the seeds enclosed until stimulated to open when the plant dies or fire causes the release of the seeds. A few species release the seeds annually.

Bottlebrush plants can be grown in pots.

They have been grown in Europe since a specimen of &quot;Callistemon citrinus&quot; was introduced to Kew Gardens in London by Joseph Banks in 1789.

<text>Melbourne Water is an Australian statutory authority owned by the Victorian State Government, which controls and manages much of the water bodies and supplies in metropolitan Melbourne, the capital of Victoria. Its jurisdiction includes all the reservoirs, lakes, wetlands, canals and urban creeks, and the sewerage and drainage systems that services the city.

Melbourne Water was formed by the merger of Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works and a number of smaller urban water authorities in 1992. Melbourne Water primarily operates under the &quot;Water Industry Act 1994&quot; and the &quot;Water Act 1989&quot;.

== Overview ==
Melbourne Water is wholly owned by the Victorian State Government. It manages Melbourne&#x27;s water supply catchments, sewage, rivers and major drainage systems throughout the Port Phillip and Westernport region. Governance of Melbourne Water is by an independent Board of Directors in conjunction with the Minister for Water.

Melbourne Water supplies water to the metropolitan retail water businesses (namely, Greater Western Water, South East Water and Yarra Valley Water), other water authorities, local councils and the land development industry. The Victorian Water Industry Association (VicWater) is the peak industry association for water companies in Victoria.

In 1994, Melbourne Parks and Waterways was separated from Melbourne Water, and became part of Parks Victoria in 1996.

=== Victorian Desalination Plant ===
The Victorian Desalination Plant is a A$3.1 billion desalination plant that was built in the Wonthaggi region of the Bass Coast. The plant can provide an additional 150 gigalitres of water each year. The base fee payable to the owner of the plant, even if no water is ordered, is $608 million a year, or $1.8 million per day, for 27 years. being between $18 and $19 billion in total. On 1 April each year, the Minister for Water places an order for the following financial year, up to 150 gigalitres a year, at an additional cost to Melbourne Water and consumers.

=== Northern Sewerage Project ===
Northern Sewerage Project is a major infrastructure project to increase the capacity of the sewerage system in Melbourne&#x27;s growing northern suburbs. It will also help protect the Merri and Moonee Ponds Creeks by virtually eliminating sewage overflows that can occur after heavy rain.

== Water restrictions ==

Melbourne Water has a system of restrictions to manage water supplies into the future. It reports on storage levels on Thursday each week while an interactive graph compares actual use. Further reviews of restrictions were needed to counter an ongoing drought, poor rainfall, record low storage levels and rising water use compared with past years.

== Infrastructure ==
The water supply system operated and managed by Melbourne Water comprises:

* catchments covering more than 140,000 hectares.
* ten major storage reservoirs with a capacity of 1,810,500 megalitres.
* 64 service reservoirs that provide short-term storage.
* about 1300 kilometres of distribution mains and aqueducts.
* 18 water pumping stations, used to pump water from low-lying areas to higher areas.
* five water filtration plants.
* 49 water treatment (disinfection) plants.

=== Water storages ===

Melbourne Water manages the ten Melbourne reservoirs. The total storage capacity is 1,810,500 megalitres.

=== Water supply catchments ===
Around 80% of Melbourne&#x27;s water is sourced from uninhabited forests in the Yarra Ranges and Central Highlands. In excess of 1,570 square kilometres is reserved for water catchment. These forests primarily consist of Mountain Ash. Catchment areas have been closed to the public for over 100 years .

In addition to the reservoirs in the table above, water is harvested via a number of diversion weirs:






Clearfell logging is permitted in the Yarra Tributaries and Thomson catchment areas. Some studies claims this reduces Melbourne&#x27;s water supply arguing that young regrowth forest uses more water than existing forest Some environmental groups claim that up to 30 thousand megalitres of water could be saved per annum by phasing out logging. This represents 6% of Melbourne&#x27;s annual usage.

<doc id="1248264" wikidata="Q836681" url="?curid=1248264" title="Give Peace a Chance">
<text>&quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; is an anti-war song written by John Lennon (originally credited to Lennon–McCartney), and recorded with the participation of a small group of friends in a performance with Yoko Ono in a hotel room in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Released as a single in July 1969 by the Plastic Ono Band on Apple Records, it is the first solo single issued by Lennon, released while he was still a member of the Beatles, and became an anthem of the American anti-war movement during the 1970s. It peaked at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 2 on the British singles chart.

==Writing and recording==

The song was written during Lennon and Ono&#x27;s &quot;Bed-In&quot; honeymoon in Montreal. When asked by a reporter what he was trying to achieve by staying in bed, Lennon answered spontaneously &quot;Just give peace a chance&quot;. He went on to say this several times during the Bed-In. Lennon asked his press officer, Derek Taylor to find a recording engineer. On 1 June 1969, in Room 1742 at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, André Perry, owner of a local recording studio, arrived and used a simple setup of four microphones and a four-track tape recorder he brought with him.

The recording session was attended by dozens of journalists and various celebrities, including Timothy Leary, Rabbi Abraham Feinberg, Joseph Schwartz, Rosemary Woodruff Leary, Petula Clark, Dick Gregory, Allen Ginsberg, Roger Scott, Murray the K and Derek Taylor, many of whom are mentioned in the lyrics. Lennon played acoustic guitar and was joined by Tommy Smothers of the Smothers Brothers, also on acoustic guitar.

The day after the recording, Perry engaged and recorded three professional singers from Montreal to add back vocals to the production, among them Mouffe and Robert Charlebois, who was a famous pop-star in Quebec and in France. 

Some years later, Perry recalled the occasion and spoke about the challenges of getting a good sound out of the recording. Because of the room&#x27;s poor acoustics, he said, the raw recording could not have been released without help:
==Songwriting credits==
When initially released in 1969, the song was credited to Lennon–McCartney.

On later releases curated by the Lennon Estate, only Lennon is credited; viz. the 1990s reissue of the 1986 album &quot;Live in New York City&quot;, the 2006 documentary &quot;The U.S. vs. John Lennon&quot;, and the 1997 compilation album &quot;Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon&quot; and its DVD version six years later.

John Lennon expressed his regrets about being &quot;guilty enough to give McCartney credit as co-writer on my first independent single instead of giving it to Yoko, who had actually written it with me.&quot;

According to author Ian MacDonald, the credit was Lennon&#x27;s way of thanking McCartney for helping him record &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot; at short notice.

==Lyrics==
The original last verse of the song refers to: &quot;John and Yoko, Timmy Leary, Rosemary [Leary], Tommy Smothers, Bobby Dylan, Tommy Cooper, Derek Taylor, Norman Mailer, Allen Ginsberg, and Hare Krishna&quot;. In the performance of &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; included on the &quot;Live Peace in Toronto 1969&quot; album, Lennon openly stated that he could not remember all of the words and improvised with the names of the band members sharing the stage with him and anything that came to mind: &quot;John and Yoko, Eric Clapton, Klaus Voormann, Penny Lane, Roosevelt, Nixon, Tommy Jones and Tommy Cooper, and somebody.&quot; The third verse contains a reference to masturbation, but Lennon changed this to &quot;mastication&quot; on the official lyric sheet. He later stated this was a &quot;cop out&quot; but wanted to avoid unnecessary controversy.

==Release and aftermath==
&quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;, backed with Ono&#x27;s &quot;Remember Love&quot; as the B-side, was released on 4 July 1969 in the UK, and a few days later on 7 July 1969 in the US. The song reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart, and number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US. &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as &quot;an infectious rhythm ballad&quot; with &quot;clever arrangement and performance.&quot;

The song quickly became the anthem of the anti Vietnam-war and counterculture movements, and was sung by half a million demonstrators in Washington, D.C., on Vietnam Moratorium Day, on 15 November 1969. They were led by Pete Seeger, who interspersed phrases like, &quot;Are you listening, Nixon?&quot; and &quot;Are you listening, Agnew?&quot;, between the choruses of protesters singing, &quot;All we are saying ... is give peace a chance&quot;.

A live concert performance of the song is included on &quot;Live Peace in Toronto 1969&quot;. (Source: Apple Records) John, Yoko, and the Elephant&#x27;s Memory performed the song on the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon in September 1972. (Source: YouTube)

The British group Yes also paid tribute to Lennon&#x27;s words on their 1971 release &quot;The Yes Album&quot;, in &quot;Your Move&quot;.

After being issued as a single, it appeared on album in a truncated form for the singles compilation &quot;Shaved Fish&quot; in 1975. The track&#x27;s first full-length album appearance was on the 1982 compilation &quot;The John Lennon Collection&quot;. Although technically the first &quot;solo&quot; single released by a member of The Beatles while the band was still active, the artist credit was to the Plastic Ono Band, not John Lennon. Shortly after Lennon&#x27;s 1980 murder, fans gathered outside the Dakota and sang &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;. The single re-charted in the UK in January 1981, peaking at number 33.

==Yoko Ono version==

On 1 June 2008, the 39th anniversary of the song&#x27;s recording, the first of three digital-only (and thus environmentally friendly) singles were released through Twisted Records exclusively on Beatport with remixes featuring a newly recorded vocal by Yoko Ono. It reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart on 16 August 2008. These are not the first versions Ono has done of this song: in 2004, she did a new version for &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot;; in 2005, a version recalling the events of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on &quot;Peace, Love &amp; Truth&quot;; and one of the first remixes with the lyrics used in this mix was released on the &quot;Open Your Box&quot; remix album. The last installment was released 18 February 2009, Yoko&#x27;s birthday.

*Lennon&#x27;s fellow ex-Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr have each incorporated the song into their live performances as a tribute to Lennon.

*The song has been used in films, television shows and theatre as it has become a recognised semiotic to indicate protest; for example it was sung by students in the 1974 film &quot;The Trial of Billy Jack&quot;, and by peace activists in the 1996 film &quot;Pretty Village, Pretty Flame&quot;. The song was featured in an episode of the TV series &quot;Mad About You&quot; in 1995.

*Louis Armstrong recorded the song on 29 May 1970, for an LP entitled &quot;Louis Armstrong and Friends&quot; (aka &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;). The 1970 Louis Armstrong recording was released as a Philips 7&quot; 45 A side single in the UK, 6073 703.
*Pearl Jam&#x27;s Eddie Vedder led the crowd in singalong to the chorus during a 2003 concert in Adelaide, Australia.

<text>Clifford Williams (born 14 December 1949) is an English musician, best known as the bassist and backing vocalist of the Australian hard rock band AC/DC. He started his professional music career in 1967 and had previously been in the English groups Home and Bandit. His first studio album with AC/DC was &quot;Powerage&quot; in 1978. Williams was inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of AC/DC in 2003. Williams announced his retirement from AC/DC in 2016, but returned for their 2020 comeback album &quot;Power Up&quot; along with band mates Brian Johnson and Phil Rudd. His side projects include benefit concerts.

==Early life==
Clifford Williams was born on 14 December 1949 in Romford, Essex. In 1961, he moved with his family to Hoylake, Merseyside, where he was influenced by the local Merseybeat movement and decided to become a musician. At the age of 13, he and some friends formed a band. He listed The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, and blues musicians such as Bo Diddley as influences, and mostly learned to play bass by &quot;listening to records and picking out notes&quot;, with his formal training limited to some lessons from a professional bassist in nearby Liverpool. He left school when he was 16 years old, working as an engineer by day and musician by night.

==Career==
===Early career===

In 1966, Williams moved to London, where he worked at a demolition site and in supermarkets while playing in various short-lived bands. He met guitarist Laurie Wisefield (later a member of Wishbone Ash) and the two became members of a band, Sugar, which soon broke up. In 1970, Williams and Wisefield joined with singer Mick Stubbs, keyboardist Clive John, and drummer Mick Cook to form the progressive rock group Home. The band signed a recording deal with Epic Records and issued their debut LP, &quot;Pause for a Hoarse Horse&quot;, in 1971. Home was a supporting act for Jeff Beck, Mott the Hoople, The Faces and Led Zeppelin.

In 1972, Jim Anderson replaced John on keyboards and Home released a self-titled album, featuring their only hit single, &quot;Dreamer&quot;, which peaked at No. 41 in the UK album charts. Their next album, &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, followed in 1973, but did not gain chart success. When British folk singer-songwriter Al Stewart suggested that Home back him on his first American tour in March 1974, Mick Stubbs left the group. The rest of the members became the Al Stewart Band, but split up after the tour. Williams briefly played with the American band Stars before forming Bandit in 1974. Bandit&#x27;s line-up included vocalist Jim Diamond and drummer Graham Broad (later in Bucks Fizz and Roger Waters&#x27;s band). The group signed with Arista Records and released a self-titled album in 1977. Bandit also performed as Alexis Korner&#x27;s backing band on 1977&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Album&quot; before disbanding later that year.

===AC/DC===

Williams considered retiring from music following Bandit&#x27;s breakup, but one of the group&#x27;s guitarists, Jimmy Litherland, convinced him to audition for the Australian group AC/DC, who were looking for a bassist after firing Mark Evans shortly after recording their 1977 studio album &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;. AC/DC had formed in Australia in 1973 and by mid-1977 the line-up was Malcolm Young on rhythm guitar and backing vocals alongside his brother Angus Young on lead guitar, Phil Rudd on drums and Bon Scott on vocals. Shortly after deciding to audition for the band, Williams saw AC/DC on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and was impressed, describing them as &quot;outrageous&quot;.

For his audition, Williams played four jam sessions with the band, and on 27 May 1977 was officially asked to join AC/DC. Angus declared the decision was partially motivated by the bassist&#x27;s good looks, which the band hoped would attract more women to their concerts. As Williams was replacing an Australian musician, there were issues resulting in problems obtaining a work permit to enter the country. His first performances with AC/DC were in Australia supporting the &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; album, with two secret gigs at Sydney&#x27;s Lifesaver. The album &quot;Powerage&quot; (1978), produced by Vanda &amp; Young, marked Williams&#x27;s studio debut. Williams remained in AC/DC from that time onwards until 2016, with only a temporary departure in 1991 as he suffered a kidney infection, during which Paul Greg had to play bass for some North American concerts in the Razors Edge World Tour. In addition to his role as bassist with AC/DC, Williams also contributed backing vocals. He has said that his favourite albums with the band are &quot;Powerage&quot; and &quot;Back in Black&quot;. On 7 July 2016, Williams announced his plans to retire from the music industry following AC/DC&#x27;s Rock or Bust World Tour. He cited his opinion that AC/DC was now &quot;a changed animal&quot; with the recent departures of several core band members; Malcolm Young could no longer contribute due to dementia, Phil Rudd could not tour due to being under house arrest, and Brian Johnson was forced into retirement due to hearing problems. In September 2016, during his last performance with AC/DC at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Williams was brought to the front of the stage by Angus Young to take a bow in the middle of &quot;For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)&quot;. On September 30, 2020, AC/DC officially confirmed that Williams, along with fellow band mates Brian Johnson and Phil Rudd, have rejoined the band. Though he performed with the band at the Power Trip Festival in October 2023, Williams is not currently touring with AC/DC on their Power Up Tour, with Chris Chaney performing in his place.

===Side projects===
In 1984, Williams played bass and backing vocals on Adam Bomb&#x27;s song &quot;I Want My Heavy Metal&quot;, for the album &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;. During AC/DC&#x27;s hiatus in the 2000s, Williams joined Bosnian musician Emir Bukovica&#x27;s band Emir &amp; Frozen Camels. The group recorded the album &quot;San&quot; in 2002 and played in some European clubs. In 2005, Williams and AC/DC singer Johnson played in a hurricane relief event in Florida, promoted by the John Entwistle Foundation. There Williams met drummer Steve Luongo, president of the foundation and former member of the John Entwistle band. Luongo later brought Williams, Johnson, and guitarist Mark Hitt for the Classic Rock Cares charity project. The quartet composed and recorded ten tracks in the studio in 2007, and followed that with a tour to raise funds for the foundation. In 2011, Williams played on a benefit concert organized by Mark Farner. Williams said he also occasionally plays with a rhythm and blues band from Fort Myers called The Juice.

==Accolades==
Since Williams&#x27; introduction to the band, AC/DC has been inducted to the Australian Recording Industry Association&#x27;s Hall of Fame (in 1988), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (in 2003). In 1982, Williams was chosen as &quot;Bassist of the Year&quot; in a vote conducted by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine.

==Personal life==
Williams married his American wife Georganne in 1980. They have two children: model and actress Erin Lucas (born 1984) and Luke (born 1986). The couple initially settled in Hawaii, but this left them feeling too isolated, and they found the school system to be lacking. In 1986, they moved to Fort Myers, Florida, at the suggestion of AC/DC bandmate and nearby resident Brian Johnson. Williams also spends time in the French city of Aix-en-Provence, where he has distant relatives. Williams&#x27; hobbies include fishing, flying, and wine.

==Style==
Williams&#x27; role in AC/DC was to provide steady but basic basslines which followed the rhythm guitar of Malcolm Young, consisting mostly of eighth notes. His basslines were sometimes written by Malcolm and Angus Young during composition, and at other times Williams developed them based on the other instrumental tracks. Williams has said of his playing, &quot;It&#x27;s not the [bass] line that counts. It is the &quot;feel&quot;. My favorite AC/DC tune to play is &#x27;Down Payment Blues&#x27;, because it&#x27;s so simple. I play four notes throughout the song, but I get off on the &quot;whole&quot; thing—not me noodlin&#x27; away.&quot; He also said that he plays &quot;the same thing in every song, for the most part [...] in AC/DC&#x27;s music, the song is more important than any individual&#x27;s bit in it&quot;. He added that &quot;complex [bass] lines wouldn&#x27;t add anything to a guitar-oriented band like [AC/DC], so [he tries] to create a bottom layer that drives what [AC/DC&#x27;s] guys are doing on top&quot;. Williams had no difficulty keeping his low profile within the band, declaring, &quot;I don&#x27;t have any problem doing this, because I enjoy playing simply. I never feel angry or prisoner.&quot; Nevertheless, he very occasionally employs more melodic lines and passing notes on some songs, such as &quot;Satellite Blues&quot;. His playing technique is mostly centred around downpicking, with the occasional use of plucking to mute the strings, which he says &quot;adds more definition and tightens up the notes, and it gives the sound less sustain&quot;.

==Equipment==
In his first appearance in 1977, he used a Gibson Ripper only for the &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; music video. Williams&#x27; trademark instrument is the StingRay and other basses by Music Man, strung with Ernie Ball (.045, .065, .085, .105) flatwounds in the studio and D&#x27;Addario roundwound XLs in the same gauge in concert. In October 2020, Ernie Ball Music Man announced that they are releasing a Cliff Williams Signature Bass which will be a genuine replica of his 1979 Music Man StingRay bass. Williams states that despite trying other basses over the years, he always went back to Music Man&#x27;s instruments, which he described as &quot;a tremendous work horse of a bass&quot;. Other basses used include the Fender Precision Bass, a Gibson Thunderbird non-reverse, Fender Jazz Bass, the Steinberger L-series, a Gibson EB-3 and at least two LAG Custom basses. Williams used 3 Ampeg SVT-810E cabinets with 2 SVT-4PRO Heads, but if there was any interference with the wireless systems, he used cables in his live performances.

<text>Resonance Raman spectroscopy (RR spectroscopy or RRS) is a variant of Raman spectroscopy in which the incident photon energy is close in energy to an electronic transition of a compound or material under examination. This similarity in energy (resonance) leads to greatly increased intensity of the Raman scattering of certain vibrational modes, compared to ordinary Raman spectroscopy. 

Resonance Raman spectroscopy has much greater sensitivity than non-resonance Raman spectroscopy, allowing for the analysis of compounds with inherently weak Raman scattering intensities, or at very low concentrations. It also selectively enhances only certain molecular vibrations (those of the chemical group undergoing the electronic transition), which simplifies spectra. For large molecules such as proteins, this selectivity helps to identify vibrational modes of specific parts of the molecule or protein, such as the heme unit within myoglobin. Resonance Raman spectroscopy has been used in the characterization of inorganic compounds and complexes, proteins, nucleic acids, pigments, and in archaeology and art history.

== Theory ==

In Raman scattering, photons collide with a sample and are scattered with a difference in energy: The scattered photons may be higher or lower in energy (have a shorter or longer wavelength) than the incident photons. This difference in energy is caused by excitation of the sample to a higher or lower vibrational energy level: if the sample was initially in an excited vibrational state, the scattered photon may be higher in energy than the incident photon (anti-Stokes Raman scattering). Otherwise, the scattered photon has a lower module of energy than the incoming photon (Stokes Raman scattering). Among the two phenomena, Stokes shift and anti-Stokes shift, the former is the most likely to occur. As a consequence, the relative intensity of Raman spectra acquired in Stokes mode is more intense than the other. For most materials, Raman scattering is extremely weak compared to Rayleigh scattering, in which light is scattered without loss of energy. Raman-scattered light, which contains information about vibrational transitions, is therefore difficult to observe for many substances.

Resonance Raman spectroscopy takes advantage of an increase in the intensity of Raman scattering when the incident photons match the energy of an electronic transition. If the energy of the photon striking the sample is equal or close to that of an electronic transition in the sample, certain Raman-active vibrational modes—those producing nuclear displacement in the same direction as the electronic transition—will exhibit greatly enhanced scattering, up to 106-fold compared to nonresonance Raman. For totally symmetric modes, this increased scattering intensity results from so-called A-term or Franck-Condon scattering, due to the nonzero Franck-Condon overlaps between ground and excited states. Nontotally symmetric modes may also be enhanced by B-term or Herzberg-Teller scattering, if the symmetry of the mode is contained in the direct product of the two electronic state symmetries. Resonance enhancement is most apparent in the case of π-π* transitions and least for metal centered (d–d) transitions. Like ordinary Raman spectroscopy, RRS observes vibrational transitions producing a nonzero change in the polarizability of the molecule or material being studied. 

Resonance Raman scattering differs from fluorescence in that it occurs without vibrational relaxation during the lifetime of the excited electronic state. It thus exhibits much narrower line widths than fluorescence. However, fluorescence and resonance Raman scattering co-occur in many materials, and interference from fluorescence may complicate the collection of resonance Raman spectra.

==Variants==

Typically, resonance Raman spectroscopy is performed in the same manner as ordinary Raman spectroscopy, using a single laser light source to excite the sample. The difference is the choice of the laser wavelength, which must be selected to match the energy of an electronic transition in the sample. A tunable laser is thus often used for resonance Raman spectroscopy, since a single laser can be used to generate many possible excitation wavelengths to match different samples. By using multiple lasers, pulsed lasers, and/or certain sample preparation techniques, a range of more sophisticated variants of RRS can be performed, including:

*Time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy: By using pulsed lasers with a controllable delay between pulses, resonance Raman spectroscopy can be used to monitor changes in the sample over time, following a laser-induced photochemical change or temperature increase. This method has been used to examine the dynamics of excited electronic states, binding of oxygen or other gases to heme-containing proteins, and protein dynamics.

*Resonance hyper-Raman spectroscopy: Excitation of the sample occurs by two-photon absorption, rather than by absorption of a single photon. This arrangement allows for excitation of modes that are forbidden in ordinary resonance Raman spectroscopy, with intensity enhancement due to resonance, and also simplifies collection of scattered light. It is especially useful for molecules that are both polar and polarizable.

*Surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy: A hybrid of RRS and surface-enhanced Raman scattering. The sample is applied to conducting nanoparticles and a laser matching the surface plasmon resonance of the nanoparticles is used for excitation. If the wavelength of the surface plasmon matches that of an electronic transition in the sample, the Raman scattering will be greatly enhanced compared to ordinary RRS.

*Resonance Raman microscopy: A microscope is used to focus the excitation laser onto a particular point in the sample, and spectra are collected for many such points. The Raman intensity at different points can then be assembled into a microscopic image of the sample. By appropriate choice of excitation wavelength, a microscopic map of the distribution only of a component of interest can be made.

==Applications==

Because of its selectivity and sensitivity, resonance Raman spectroscopy is typically used to study molecular vibrations in compounds that would have very weak and/or complex Raman spectra in the absence of resonance enhancement. Like ordinary Raman spectroscopy, resonance Raman is compatible with samples in water, which has a very weak scattering intensity and little contribution to spectra. However, the need for an excitation laser with a wavelength matching that of an electronic transition in the analyte of interest somewhat limits the applicability of the method.

===Pigments and Dyes===
Dyes and pigments, all of which exhibit electronic transitions in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, were among the first substances to be studied by resonance Raman spectroscopy. Resonance Raman spectra of beta-carotene and lycopene in intact plant samples were reported in 1970. Since then, the method has been used to noninvasively measure levels of these nutrients in human skin. The resonance Raman spectra of other polyene pigments, such as spheroidene and retinal, have been used to identify differences in chromophore conformation in photoactive proteins. Resonance Raman spectroscopy has been used in archaeology to identify dyes and pigments in cultural artifacts, and the ability of RRS to distinguish different modern inks and dyes has found application in forensic science.

===Proteins===
Proteins have been widely examined by resonance Raman spectroscopy. Protein-bound cofactors that absorb in the visible wavelength range, such as heme, flavins, or transition metal complexes, can be examined by RRS with minimal spectral overlap from the rest of the molecule. This method has been used to examine gas binding in hemeproteins and the catalytic cycle of various enzymes. Using ultraviolet laser excitation, it is possible to selectively excite the sidechains of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) to deduce the local environment and hydrogen-bonding interactions by these residues. With shorter-wavelength (&quot;deep&quot;) ultraviolet excitation, it is also possible to excite the peptide bonds of a protein in order to examine secondary structure. Protein folding and denaturation have been examined using deep-UV resonance Raman spectroscopy of the polypeptide backbone, with excitation wavelengths shorter than 200 nm.

===Nucleic acids and viruses===

Resonance Raman spectroscopy with ultraviolet excitation can be used to examine the chemistry, structure, and intermolecular interactions of nucleic acids, specifically the bases. Interactions between nucleic acids and DNA-binding compounds such as drugs can be examined by selectively exciting either the nucleobases or the drug itself. The resonance Raman spectra of DNA can be used to identify bacterial DNA in living cells, and to quantitate DNA under different culture conditions, and even to distinguish different bacterial species. Viruses have also been studied using UV resonance Raman spectroscopy; the method has the capability to separately interrogate the structure of the nucleic acid or capsid protein components of the virus, through the choice of the appropriate excitation wavelength.

===Nanomaterials===

Resonance Raman spectroscopy has also been used to characterize the structure and photophysical properties of nanoparticles. Using lasers tuned to the visible and near-infrared electronic transitions of carbon nanotubes, it is possible to enhance structure-sensitive vibrational bands of the nanotubes. Nanowires of inorganic semiconductor materials including gallium phosphide and carbon-encapsulated mercury telluride have also been shown to exhibit resonance Raman spectra with visible excitation light.

<doc id="1248281" wikidata="Q348704" url="?curid=1248281" title="Chris Slade">
<text>Chris Slade (born Christopher Slade Rees; 30 October 1946) is a Welsh drummer, who is perhaps best known for playing for Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band from its inception in 1971 to 1978 on eight albums, and AC/DC, for which he drummed from 1989 to 1994 and performed on the 1990 album &quot;The Razors Edge&quot;. He returned to AC/DC in February 2015 to replace Phil Rudd for the &quot;Rock or Bust World Tour&quot;. Slade has also played with Tom Jones, Toomorrow, Uriah Heep, The Firm, and Asia.

==Early life and career==

Slade was born Christopher Rees in Pontypridd, Glamorgan, South Wales. He has worked with Gary Numan, Tom Jones, Olivia Newton-John (as co-members of the band Toomorrow), and Uriah Heep. Slade was an original founding member of Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band, playing on their eight studio albums released from 1972 to 1978.

In the mid-1980s Slade played with Paul Rodgers and Jimmy Page in The Firm. He has played with Pink Floyd&#x27;s David Gilmour, and Gary Moore on his 1989 world tour.

Slade received his highest exposure in November 1989 when he was asked to join AC/DC after drummer Simon Wright had departed. AC/DC were signed to the same management company as Gary Moore, with whom Slade had just finished touring. The Young brothers (Angus and Malcolm) initially hired Slade only temporarily through management, then asked him–during the recording of the only album he made with them – to join the band. Slade played on &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; album in 1990 and the accompanying world tour, and the &quot;Big Gun&quot; single released in 1993. According to Slade, after working on demos for the following album, &quot;Ballbreaker&quot;, Malcolm Young called Slade and told him they wanted to try a reunion with former drummer Phil Rudd. Slade replied, &quot;That&#x27;s me out then, I&#x27;m gone.&quot; Young said that he wanted to keep Slade on hand if Rudd&#x27;s return did not work out, but Slade refused. However he made statements that he still got on well with AC/DC and &quot;it was an honour and a privilege to play with those guys&quot;.

After his departure Slade spent a few years living in the UK countryside, before receiving a call from Geoff Downes of the British progressive rock group Asia. Slade played with Asia for six years, before departing in September 2005.

Slade has fronted an AC/DC tribute band, Chris Slade Steel Circle, and is currently touring the World with THE CHRIS SLADE TIMELINE – a band formed to celebrate 50 years as a rock drummer. The band takes music from all aspects of his lengthy career and has appeared at major festivals including Hellfest, 24 Hours of Le Mans, Harley Davidson Aquitaine, and Saint Tropez and is the only rock band to play the Moscow Olympic Stadium for the Kremlin Cup tennis tournament.

==Return to AC/DC==
Speculation regarding Slade&#x27;s return to AC/DC started shortly after Phil Rudd&#x27;s legal troubles became public. In a December 2014 podcast by Chris Jericho, Jericho mentioned that he had it on good authority that Slade would be returning to AC/DC.

Slade was photographed signing albums with the band on 7 February 2015.

After the photo appeared publicly, Slade finally admitted that he was going to be the band&#x27;s drummer and admitted to secrecy surrounding his return, and stated that it was done for the right reasons. The band issued a statement, &quot;Chris Slade will be on drums for the upcoming Rock or Bust world tour.&quot;.

Since that time, in addition to playing live, Slade has appeared in all promotional photos taken with the band and appeared in the music video for the single &quot;Rock the Blues Away&quot;. In late April 2015 AC/DC&#x27;s official website listed him as the band&#x27;s drummer. 

On 30 September 2020, his role within the band was made clear: Phil Rudd was returning to AC/DC on the drums, effectively making Slade leave the band for a second time. In the same announcement, Brian Johnson and Cliff Williams were also returning to the band.

==Equipment==
Slade endorses Drum Workshop drums, pedals and hardware, Paiste cymbals, Remo drumheads, LP percussion and London drumsticks. Before switching to DW, he previously endorsed Pearl drums, pedals and hardware.

<text>The Scania N113 was a transverse-engined step-entrance and low-floor city bus chassis manufactured by Scania between 1988 and 2000.

==History==


The Scania N113 was designed as a successor to the N112. Most of the single-decker buses and the double-decker buses have a double-curvature windscreen with an arched top. It had an 11-litre engine mounted at the rear, coupled to either a Scania or Voith gearbox. It was available as:
*a standard-floor single-decker bus (N113CLB/N113CRB)
*a low-floor single-decker bus (N113CLB-LG/N113CLL/N113CRL)
*a double-decker bus with two or three axles (N113DRB/3-axle N113)
*an articulated bus (N113ALB).

==United Kingdom==
A total of 641 N113s were sold in the United Kingdom, this figure made up of 405 two-axle double-deckers, 194 standard-floor single-deckers and 42 low-floor single-deckers.

The double-deckers were offered with bodywork by Alexander, East Lancs and Northern Counties, while most of the standard-floor single-deckers were bodied by Alexander to their PS and Strider designs, though the Wright Endurance, Plaxton Verde and East Lancs EL2000 were also specified.

London Transport was to be the biggest UK customer for the double-deckers, taking 71 between 1989 and 1992 for its London Northern and East London subsidiaries. Of these, 29 were bodied by Alexander, the other 42 by Northern Counties. Brighton &amp; Hove bought 51 between 1989 and 1998, all with East Lancs bodies. Yorkshire Rider took 42 in 1990 and 1991 (37 with Alexander bodies and five with Northern Counties bodies), while West Midlands Travel took 40 with Alexander bodies in 1990.

Nottingham City Transport would buy 23, while Midland Fox took 20, and Kingston upon Hull City Transport and Mayne Coaches both bought 16. There were also 13 for Northumbria Motor Services, 12 for Newport Transport, and ten each for Busways Travel Services (the former Tyne and Wear PTE undertaking), Cardiff Bus and Liverline of Liverpool. Other customers included Grey-Green, Borehamwood Travel Services, GM Buses, Midland Red North and Derby City Transport.

Busways was the first United Kingdom customer for the standard-floor single-decker in 1989, eventually taking 36, all with Alexander PS bodies. The biggest customer, however, was Yorkshire Rider, which bought 55 with Alexander Strider bodies in 1993 and 1994. Newport took 30 Strider-bodied versions between 1993 and 1997, while GRT Group took 26 with Wright Endurance bodies in 1994/95 for its Midland Bluebird and Lowland Scottish fleets. Cardiff Bus bought 14 with Plaxton Verde bodies in 1992 and a further seven with Strider bodies in 1994, while Nottingham took eight PS-bodied versions in 1990. Among other customers were Yorkshire Traction, Tayside Buses and Stevensons of Uttoxeter.

Of the 42 low-floor single-deckers, 30 Wright Pathfinder bodied examples were bought by London Buses in 1994 for trials at its East London and Leaside Buses subsidiaries. The other 12 carried an East Lancs body marketed jointly as the MaxCi, and of these, five went to Clydeside 2000, four to Midland Red North, and one to Tayside.

==Hong Kong==
In 1993, Kowloon Motor Bus purchased two Alexander RH-bodied Scania N113 tri-axle double-deckers. The Alexander RH buses all have a double-curvature windscreen with an arched top. They were equipped with Scania DS11-74 engines (274 bhp) and Voith DIWA863 gearboxes.

Another 20 were purchased in 1996, but equipped with Scania&#x27;s DSC11-24 engine instead of DS11-74. All were withdrawn between 2010 and 2014.

==Singapore==

Singapore Bus Service took delivery of 200 Alexander PS bodied Scania N113CRBs in 1989 and 1990, 50 of which were air-conditioned and the remaining 150 non air-conditioned. Several of the non air-conditioned buses were retrofit with air conditioned in-between 1998 and 1999.

These Scania N113CRBs served mainly the eastern parts of Singapore and were predominantly under the control of the Bedok North Depot, with a minority at Ang Mo Kio Depot, Braddell Bus Park and Hougang Depot. They were transferred to SBS Transit on 1 November 2001 and progressive retired from 19 August 2008 to 1 May 2009. These buses were repainted between January 2004 until December 2007. Some of them were already replaced by Volvo B10M who in turn replaced by Scania K230UB. The N113CRBs operated on a majority of trunk, feeder and Townlink services in the East.

==Australia==
Metro Tasmania purchased 147 Ansair bodied N113CRBs between 1989 and 1995.

==Replacement==
In 1997, Scania introduced its 4-series range of buses, which utilised smaller and cleaner engines in order to comply with Euro2 emission limits. The N113 thus gave way to the low-floor, 9-litre-engined N94. However, N113 double-deckers continued to be sold in the UK until 2000, the last examples being a batch with East Lancs Cityzen bodies built for stock and sold to a variety of small operators. The N94 was eventually introduced to the UK in 2002, in both single-deck and double-deck forms.

For the Hong Kong market, Scania developed the low-floor Scania K94UB 6x2/4 double-decker bus, but only one prototype was built.

<text>INS &quot;Sindhurakshak&quot; (Sanskrit, for &quot;Protector of the Seas&quot;) was a Russian-made Kilo-class 877EKM () diesel-electric submarine of the Indian Navy. Commissioned on 24 December 1997, it was the ninth of the ten Kilo-class submarines in the Indian Navy. On 4 June 2010, the Indian Defence Ministry and Zvezdochka shipyard signed a contract worth US$80 million to upgrade and overhaul the submarine. After the overhaul, it returned to India from Russia between May and June 2013.

The submarine suffered a major fire and explosion on 14 August 2013 and sank at Mumbai&#x27;s naval dockyard with the death of 18 crew members.

==Construction==
&quot;Sindhurakshak&quot; was constructed at the Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Construction of the submarine began in 1995. It was launched in June 1997 and delivered to India in December 1997.

==Service history==
===Kargil war (1999)===
&quot;Sindhurakshak&quot; was deployed very close to Karachi, Pakistan during the Kargil War in 1999.

===President Kalam (2006)===

On 13 February 2006, during the submarine&#x27;s deployment in Vishakhapatnam under the Eastern Naval Command, the then President of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam became the first Indian head of state to sail in a submarine. He was given a demonstrative excursion, during which the submarine dived and sailed in the Bay of Bengal for a few hours. He was accompanied by the Chief of Naval Staff Arun Prakash. The submarine was commanded by Commander P S Bisht.

===Accident (2010)===
A fire broke out aboard &quot;Sindhurakshak&quot; while the vessel was in Visakhapatnam in February 2010. One sailor was killed and two others were injured. Navy officials reported that the fire had been caused by an explosion in the submarine&#x27;s battery compartment, which occurred due to a faulty battery valve that leaked hydrogen gas.

===Upgrades===
After the fire damage in 2010, &quot;Sindhurakshak&quot; was transported to Russia on board a heavy lift ship from Visakhapatnam in June 2010 for refit, overhaul and upgrade which lasted two and a half years. In August 2010, &quot;Sindhurakshak&quot; arrived at the Zvezdochka shipyard in Russia. The submarine was modernised, repaired and retrofitted under Project 08773, and after the upgrade, the sea trials started in October 2012. The upgrades included improved electronic warfare systems, an integrated weapon control system and a new cooling system, and were expected to extend the service life of the submarine by ten years. The Club-S (3M54E1 anti-ship and 3M14E land attack) missiles, USHUS sonar, СCS-MK-2 radio communication systems and Porpoise radio-locating radar, and other safety-enhancing features were incorporated. The submarine was handed back to the Indian Navy on 27 January 2013, after which it sailed back to India, under Commander Rajesh Ramkumar. This was the first time an Indian submarine had navigated under ice.
===Incident in the Mediterranean===
In March 2013, while returning from the refit, &quot;Sindhurakshak&quot; encountered severe storms in the Mediterranean Sea when it was travelling near Alexandria. This was part of the submarine&#x27;s extensive three-month-long deployment, where it traveled 10,000 miles. The severity of the storms prevented the Alexandria port authorities from sending a tugboat, and the shallow waters prevented the submarine from diving. An emergency call was placed via the Indian Ministry of External Affairs to the Egyptian Navy, which sent its latest tugboats and towed the submarine to Port Said.

===Explosion and sinking (2013)===
On 14 August 2013, the &quot;Sindhurakshak&quot; sank after explosions caused by a fire on board when the submarine was berthed at Mumbai. The fire, followed by a series of ordnance blasts on the armed submarine, occurred shortly after midnight. Though the fire was put out within two hours, due to damage from the explosions, the submarine sank and was partially submerged in 15 metres deep water at its berth, with only a portion of the sail visible above the water surface. Three sailors on board reportedly jumped off to safety. Navy divers were also brought in as there was a possibility that 18 personnel were trapped inside and Defence Minister A. K. Antony confirmed that there were fatalities. Other sources stated that a small explosion occurred around midnight which then triggered the two larger explosions.

Due to the explosion, the front section of the submarine was twisted, bent and crumpled, and water had entered the forward compartment. Another submarine, was berthed very close to &quot;Sindhurakshak&quot; in the congested Mumbai naval dockyard; and sustained minor fire damage, though the navy did not release details of the extent of damage. &quot;Sindhurakshak&quot;&#x27;s double hull was credited with preventing further damage to surrounding vessels. Official sources at the time said it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; the submarine could be returned to service. The navy planned to begin salvage operations after the rescue operation was completed. By 19 August, seven bodies had been recovered, with 11 still missing. On 31 August, six of the eleven recovered bodies had been identified and sent home for last rites with military honours.

The Navy&#x27;s preliminary report indicated that &quot;an accident or inadvertent mishandling of ammunition&quot; was the cause of the explosions; the full incident report would only be completed after the submarine was raised. The salvage contract was awarded on 31 January 2014 to Resolve India, a subsidiary of the US-based Resolve Marine Group. The submarine was brought to the surface on 6 June 2014. In December 2014, a naval court of inquiry arrived at the preliminary conclusion that human error as a result of crew fatigue caused the disaster. A senior officer stated that &quot;the crew was working beyond their prescribed hours. Fatigue and exhaustion may have triggered human error that led to the accident. Standard operating procedures were violated at several levels&quot;. A 2017 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India quoted the Navy&#x27;s Board of Inquiry stating that &quot;Submarine authorities concerned didn’t properly assess the crew fatigue, besides, the submarine was holding ammunition nearing life expiry&quot;.

Initially, the navy was hopeful of using &quot;Sindhurakshak&quot; after it was salvaged, but on Navy Day 2015, Vice Admiral Cheema confirmed the Sindhurakshak would be disposed of. After a period of use for the training of marine commandos, the submarine was sunk in 3000 metres of water in the Arabian Sea in June 2017.

<doc id="1248299" wikidata="Q5957788" url="?curid=1248299" title="Hyperbolic link">
<text>In mathematics, a hyperbolic link is a link in the 3-sphere with complement that has a complete Riemannian metric of constant negative curvature, i.e. has a hyperbolic geometry. A hyperbolic knot is a hyperbolic link with one component.

As a consequence of the work of William Thurston, it is known that every knot is precisely one of the following: hyperbolic, a torus knot, or a satellite knot. As a consequence, hyperbolic knots can be considered plentiful. A similar heuristic applies to hyperbolic links. 

As a consequence of Thurston&#x27;s hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem, performing Dehn surgeries on a hyperbolic link enables one to obtain many more hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

==Examples==

*Borromean rings are hyperbolic.
*Every non-split, prime, alternating link that is not a torus link is hyperbolic by a result of William Menasco.
*41 knot (the figure-eight knot)
*52 knot (the three-twist knot)
*61 knot (the stevedore knot)
*62 knot
*63 knot
*74 knot
*10 161 knot (the &quot;Perko pair&quot; knot)
*12n242 knot

<text>Lewis Frederick Urry ( – ) was a Canadian-American chemical engineer and inventor. He invented both the alkaline battery and lithium battery while working for the Eveready Battery company.

==Life==
Urry was born January 29, 1927, in Pontypool, Ontario, and graduated with a degree in chemical engineering from the University of Toronto in 1950, having previously spent time serving in the Canadian army. He went to work for Eveready Battery a few months after graduating. He was married to Beverley Ann (died 1993) and they had 3 sons and 2 daughters. He died October 19, 2004, and is buried in Butternut Ridge Cemetery, in Eaton Township, Ohio.

==Career==
In 1955, Urry was dispatched to the company&#x27;s laboratory in Parma, Ohio, in order to discover a way of extending the lifespan of the zinc-carbon battery. The low longevity of these batteries had been seriously damaging sales. Urry realized that developing a new battery would be more cost-effective than developing the old ones further.

Throughout the 1950s, many engineers had experimented with alkaline batteries, but nobody had been able to develop a longer-running battery which was worth the higher cost of production. Urry, after testing a number of materials, discovered that manganese dioxide and solid zinc worked well coupled with an alkaline substance as an electrolyte. His main problem was that the battery could not provide enough power. Urry managed to overcome this problem by using powdered zinc.

On October 9, 1957, Lewis Urry, Karl Kordesch, and P.A. Marsal filed US patent (2,960,558) for this revolutionary alkaline dry cell battery with a powdered zinc gel anode. It was granted on November 15, 1960, and assigned to Union Carbide Corporation.

In order to sell the idea to his managers, Urry put the battery in a toy car and raced it round the canteen against a similar car with one of the older batteries. His new invention had many times the durability, and Eveready began production of Urry&#x27;s design in 1959.

In 1980, the brand was renamed Energizer. Modern alkaline batteries, due to technological improvements, can last as much as 40 times longer than the original prototype.

In 1999, Urry gave his first prototype battery, along with the first commercially produced cylindrical battery, to the Smithsonian Institution. Both cells are now displayed in the same room as Edison&#x27;s light bulb.

<text>A strap, sometimes also called strop, is an elongated or ribbon, usually of leather or other flexible materials.

Thin straps are used as part of clothing or baggage, or bedding such as a sleeping bag. See for example spaghetti strap, shoulder strap. A strap differs from a belt mainly in that a strap is usually integral to the item of clothing; either can be used in combination with buckles.

Straps are also used as fasteners to attach, secure, carry, or bind items, to objects, animals (for example a saddle on a horse) and people (for example a watch on a wrist), or even to tie down people and animals, as on an apparatus for corporal punishment. Occasionally a strap is specified after what it binds or holds, e.g. chin strap. Webbing is a particular type of strap that is a strong fabric woven as a flat strip or tube that is also often used in place of rope. Modern webbing is typically made from exceptionally high-strength material and is used in automobile seat belts, furniture manufacturing, transportation, towing, military uniform, cargo fasteners, and many other fields.

== Components ==
* Strap loop
* Strap union
* Strap fitting

==Packaging==
The strap is commonly used in the packaging industry to secure or fasten items. It may be made from a wide range of materials, such as plastic, steel, paper, or fabric. Usually, the strap is secured to itself through various means, but it may also be secured to other items, such as pallets.

<text>Rock and roll is a musical genre from the United States, popularized worldwide beginning in the 1950s. Though rock had become popular earlier, it was not until the mid-1980s breakthrough of Laibach, who are now internationally renowned, that Slovenian rock became well-known. Other well-known Slovenian rock bands include Hic et Nunc, whose 1998 tour of the United States brought even more international attention to Slovenian rock.

In Yugoslavia, Slovenia was the center for punk rock. The best-known representatives of this genre were Pankrti, Niet, Lublanski Psi, Čao Pičke, Via Ofenziva, Tožibabe, and Otroci Socializma.

Popular rock artists, largely unknown outside the country, are: Lačni Franz (Zoran Predin), Šank Rock, Big Foot Mama, Zaklonišče Prepeva, Siddharta, Vlado Kreslin, Niet, Mi2, Buldožer, Carpe Diem, Dan D, Društvo mrtvih pesnikov, Elvis Jackson (ska punk), Orlek, Avtomobili, Pink Panker, Joker Out and others.

Slovenian neofolk/martial industrial band Laibach are also sometimes mentioned as the most known Slovenian &quot;rock&quot; band.

<doc id="1248309" wikidata="Q7315443" url="?curid=1248309" title="Resident magistrate">
<text>A resident magistrate is a title for magistrates used in certain parts of the world, that were, or are, governed by the British. Sometimes abbreviated as RM, it refers to suitably qualified personnel—notably well versed in the law—brought into an area from outside as the local magistrate, typically to be the guiding hand amongst other lay magistrates.

In colonial history, resident magistrates have had gubernatorial functions in a few minor, isolated colonial settlements, such as:
*Ascension, as dependency of Saint Helena; post filled by managers of Eastern Telegraph/Cable and Wireless since 1922 (previously under a commanding officer), replaced since June 1964 by an Administrator
*Walvisbaai, only two incumbents shortly after the 12 March 1878 annexation by Britain as Walvis Bay protectorate, first under a captain; annexation confirmed 14 December 1878:
**1 June 1878 – November 1880 D. Erskine
**November 1880 – 7 August 1884 Benjamin Musgrave, staying on as Magistrate

Resident magistrates&#x27; courts remain in operation as one of the divisions of the judiciary of Jamaica, hearing civil and criminal cases in each parish of the island.

==In Ireland==

In pre-independence Ireland, a Resident Magistrate was a stipendary magistrate appointed to a county (outside of the Dublin Metropolitan Police District) to sit among the justices of the peace at Petty Sessions in that county. They were appointed by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (in reality, therefore, by the Dublin Castle administration in Ireland).

===Role===
The role of resident magistrate was created on a somewhat trial basis in 1814, and extended to the entire country by the Constabulary (Ireland) Act 1836. The resident magistrate was supposed to sit amongst the justices at Petty Sessions—the courts of summary jurisdiction in pre-independence Ireland—and guide the justices to apply the law impartially. In reality they came to preside at Petty Sessions, and even sit alone without justices. RMs did not need to be legally trained in pre-independence Ireland, and many were ex-British Army officers. The &quot;Resident&quot; referred to the requirement that the magistrate live in the county to which he was assigned.

The role was often criticised as being under the influence of the Dublin Castle administration, and Irish politicians often cited the &quot;RM&quot; as really standing for &quot;Removable Magistrate&quot;, since they held office at the Lord Lieutenant&#x27;s pleasure and could be removed.

In some parts of western counties in the later 1800s at the time of the Famine, and then the Land War, it became hard to find enough suitably-educated local magistrates, and so an RM could be sent to help them. He was salaried and they were volunteers.

===After Irish independence===

The office of RM was unique in the United Kingdom to Ireland, and in the 20th century, led to the modern position in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland whereby courts of summary jurisdiction (the District Court in the Republic and Magistrates&#x27; Courts in Northern Ireland), are composed of legally qualified district judges sitting alone. This is in sharp contrast to England and Wales where magistrates courts mainly consist of benches of three lay justices and there are only a minority of paid district judges (magistrates&#x27; courts). In Scotland Justice of the Peace Courts are also primarily staffed by lay magistrates.

====Republic of Ireland====
In the part of Ireland that was to become the Irish Free State, Petty Sessions could not be held for many years due to the Irish War of Independence, restricting the role of the RMs. On 23 August 1922, the Provisional Government of Ireland placed all of the RMs on leave, and at the end of September 1922 it terminated all commissions of the peace, effectively dismissing all the RMs and justices of the peace. This was not quite the end of the office of Resident Magistrate, as it then proceeded to appoint 27 solicitors and barristers to the post. Although appointed to the position of Resident Magistrate, the Provisional Government only publicly described these individuals as District Justices, and brought in legislation in 1923 (the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923) to officially change the name of the position. The Courts of Justice Act 1924 finally abolished the office and transferred its jurisdiction to the District Court of Justice. The Justices of the District Court continued to be popularly called District Justices until the position was renamed Judge of the District Court (or District Judge) in 1991.

====Northern Ireland====
The position continued as before in Northern Ireland until 1935, when the Summary Jurisdiction and Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) was passed. From then on Resident Magistrates had to be legally qualified solicitors or barristers in Northern Ireland of at least six years&#x27; standing. Petty Sessions (which later became known as Magistrates&#x27; Courts) would henceforth consist solely of a resident magistrate sitting alone. Since the passing of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, two lay magistrates sit with the district judge in Youth Court (criminal proceedings involving children) and Family Proceedings Court (family law) matters, but the judge still sits alone in other matters. Where lay magistrates sit with the judge, the judge presides and guides the lay magistrates in the law. The position was renamed District Judge (Magistrates Court) in 2008.

===In popular culture===

The book &quot;Some Experiences of an Irish RM&quot; by Edith Somerville and Violet Florence Martin, published in 1899 focused on a fictional Irish RM, Major Yeates. Two sequels were written and a TV programme, &quot;The Irish R.M.&quot;, produced by RTÉ and UTV, which ran between 1983 and 1985.

==In Australia==
===Western Australia===
Governor James Stirling introduced the position of the Resident Magistrate or the government resident in the early 1830s as a means of assisting the Perth centre in the administration of the various and the small and distant settlements located throughout the Swan River Colony. Those appointed were usually prominent local farmers or businessmen as well as men who had some military background. As the representative of the Colonial Government, the Resident Magistrate was considered to be very powerful in the district and it was a position of certain status.

Although not a fulltime position the Resident Magistrates &#x27;were expected to maintain law and order; register births, marriages and deaths; control and protect the Aboriginals; care for public buildings and works; and supervise all other government officers in the district, if there were any, or otherwise perform the work of all branches of government themselves as required&#x27;.

They acted as the Chairmen of the local Courts of Petty Sessions and Small Debts, and from 1863 were given the legal authority to determine court cases alone.

==Deputy magistrate==
When the Caprivi Strip (formerly German Barotse- or Zambezi-land, in present Namibia) which had been administered by British Military Administrators since 21 September 1914 formally came under the administration of the British high commissioners for Southern Africa, the last Military Administrator stayed on as the first of only two Deputy magistrates, the highest British colonial official actually resident in the Strip:

* 1 January 1921 – c.1924 H. Neale
* 1940 – 1951 Lyall French Trollope

<text>Ronald Chippindale (26 March 1933 – 12 February 2008) was the Chief Inspector of Air Accidents in charge of the New Zealand Office of Air Accidents Investigations.

==Early life and family==
Born in Kettering, Northamptonshire, England, on 26 March 1933, Chippindale was the son of George Frederick Chippindale, an engineer in the Royal Air Force, and Irene Eulalia Chippindale (née Neall). The family moved to New Zealand in 1938, and Ron Chippindale was educated at Rangiora High School.

In 1954, Chippindale married June Rosemary Spackman, and the couple went on to have four children.

==RNZAF career==
Chippindale was a pilot for the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) from 1951 to 1974, flying transport and training aircraft. He was a qualified flight instructor and spent over eight years in Defence Flight Safety before retiring (as a squadron leader) after 23 years of service. He was a graduate of the Royal Air Force College Cranwell.

==Inspector of Air Accidents==
On retirement from the RNZAF, Chippindale was appointed as an Inspector of Air Accidents in 1974 and in 1975 became Chief Inspector of Air Accidents in charge of the New Zealand Office of Air Accidents Investigations.

During this time period, he was the investigator-in-charge of 48 aircraft and rail accidents and incidents, and had overall responsibility for the investigation of approximately 400 accidents and incidents. He was involved in several major aircraft accident investigation such as being the chief investigator of the November 1979 Mount Erebus Disaster, the DC-10 accident in Antarctica in which 257 lives were lost. He was responsible for the official accident report for this disaster and concluded the accident was a result of pilot error. This biased conclusion was controversial and a Royal Commission was established presided over by Justice Peter Mahon QC. Mahon&#x27;s report cleared the crew and blamed the company for altering the programmed flight plan without informing the crew. As part of the report Chippindale was described as having a poor grasp of the flying involved in jet airline operation, as he (and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority - CAA in general) was typically involved in investigating simple light aircraft crashes. Chippindale&#x27;s investigation techniques were revealed as lacking in rigour, which allowed errors and avoidable gaps in knowledge to appear in reports. Consequently, Chippindale entirely missed the importance of the flight plan change and the rare meteorological conditions of Antarctica.

When the Office was abolished in 1990, he was appointed Acting Chief Executive Officer and Chief Inspector of Air Accidents in the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC), which replaced the Office of Air Accidents Investigation. In 1992, when a Chief Executive was appointed, Chippindale became the Chief Inspector of Accidents with the TAIC, an appointment he retained until his retirement on 31 October 1998.

He was a member of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) teams, which investigated the Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 air disaster in South Africa in which the President of Mozambique lost his life, and the shooting down of three civil aircraft: Korean Air Lines Flight 007 over Russia and two United Nations (UN) Lockheed L-100 Hercules aircraft in Angola.

Chippindale represented New Zealand at Accident Investigation Group meetings of ICAO and drafted the ICAO circular on the provision of &quot;Family Assistance&quot; after an aircraft accident. He was also the New Zealand Councillor to the International Society of Air Accident Investigators and a transport accident investigation consultant.

==Honours and awards==
In 1990, Chippindale received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In 2004, he was awarded the Jerome F Lederer award for outstanding lifetime contributions in the field of aircraft accident investigation and prevention and achievement of the International Society of Air Safety Investigators&#x27; Objectives and technical excellence. In March 2007, Chippindale was one of 22 people who received a New Zealand Special Service Medal (Erebus) at a ceremony in Wellington. The medal was awarded for the work in what became known as &quot;Operation Overdue&quot;.

==Death==
On 12 February 2008, while out on an early morning walk near his home in Porirua, 20 km north of Wellington, Chippindale was hit by an out-of-control car and was killed instantly.

At the time of his death, Chippindale was an adjunct lecturer teaching &quot;Aircraft Safety Investigations&quot; in a three-paper series extramurally (by correspondence) at Massey University School of Aviation.

<text>Alessandro Fortis (16 September 1842 – 4 December 1909) was an Italian politician who served as the 18th prime minister of Italy from 1905 to 1906.
==Early career==
Fortis was born in Forlì, in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, and became a lawyer. A republican follower of Giuseppe Mazzini, he joined Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1866 and fought with him first in Trentino then at Mentana and in France. After being elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1880, Fortis initially worked under Francesco Crispi as Under Secretary of the Interior (1887–1890). He served as Agriculture Minister from 1898 to 1899 in the first government of Luigi Pelloux (June 1898–May 1899).

He resigned in 1899 and subsequently joined the liberal opposition of Giovanni Giolitti, whose liberal reformism was closest to Fortis’s own political views that had moderated over time. Fortis argued that a view of the state &quot;which abstains from everything, which increasingly reduces its actions and its responsibilities; the state which is feared, rather than appealed to ... is, it seems to me, doomed to die out.&quot;

The moderate liberals opposed the repressive measures of Pelloux restricting political activity and free speech, and aimed to uphold constitutional liberties. Fortis supported the governments of Giuseppe Zanardelli (February 1901 – November 1903) and Giolitti (November 1903 – March 1905).

==Prime minister==
In March 1905 on the recommendation of Giolitti, he formed his first government, mainly related to the nationalization of the railways, after confronting a railroad strike on April 17–22 that year, which could have paralyzed transportation in the country. Railroad workers became public employees, which deprived them of the right to strike.

In September 1905, Fortis visited Calabria and Sicily to examine firsthand the extent of the damage of the 1905 Calabria earthquake. Subsequently he introduced a special law to aid these southern regions. This measure was the first real acknowledgment by the Italian state of the fundamental problems underlying southern underdevelopment.

His government was defeated in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of Parliament) in December 1905, when a trade treaty with Spain that would have significantly reduced Italian tariffs on Spanish wine, met with severe parliamentary and public opposition and was rejected. Fortis resigned, was reappointed and formed a new government, which did not gain the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, after which Fortis definitively resigned in February 1906.

==Death and family==
Fortis was Jewish. He died on 4 December 1909 in Rome.

<doc id="1248330" wikidata="Q6792384" url="?curid=1248330" title="Maui Ocean Center">
<text>The Maui Ocean Center is an aquarium and oceanography center located in Maalaea, Hawaii, on the island of Maui. Opened on March 13, 1998, by Coral World International, the 3 acres (1.2 ha) facility is the largest living tropical reef aquarium in the Western Hemisphere. Their exhibits include colorful displays of live coral reef habitats, diverse collections of endemic Hawaiian fish species, and up-close viewing of sea turtles, stingrays, sharks, and various sea creatures.

Maui Ocean Center is the only public aquarium on Maui and exclusively displays marine life found in Hawaiian waters. The SEASCAPE restaurant at the aquarium is unique in that the restaurant is the only restaurant in all of Hawaii to be platinum certified for sustainability due to the restaurant offering 100% sustainable dining.

== Exhibits ==
Maui Ocean Center has six main exhibits that focus on reef fish, deep water animals, Hawaiian culture and history, and more.

=== Living Reef ===
The Living Reef exhibit showcases over 40 Hawaiian coral species that range from shallow to deep-reef environments. Guests can observe the changes in species and coloration of marine life as they journey from the shallow reef to mid reef, and eventually, the deep reef.

=== Turtle Lagoon ===
This exhibit is home to the Hawaiian green sea turtle, one of Earth&#x27;s most ancient animals. Featuring both a surface and underwater view of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s beloved honu (turtles), this exhibit has up to six sea turtles on display at all times.

Native to Hawaiʻi, the green sea turtle is the largest hard-shelled sea turtle in the world, reaching lengths of up to four feet and weighing in at over 300 pounds in adulthood.

=== Hawaiians and the Sea ===
This exhibit tells the stories of the kanaka maoli, Hawaiʻi&#x27;s first people, and how they sailed across the Pacific in double-hulled canoes using the stars as guides.

== Living Coral Reefs ==

Maui Ocean Center has successfully raised and maintained coral colonies since 1998. Their exhibits receive saltwater directly from Māʻalaea Bay, resulting in environments that allow fish, corals, and other marine invertebrates to thrive.

=== Coral Restoration ===
MOCMI operates one of only four land-based coral nurseries in the United States and strives to protect all rare and endemic species of coral in Hawai῾i. In the case of widespread coral die-off, MOCMI&#x27;s coral repository will provide a safe haven for corals of Hawaiʻi and currently the gene bank at the center holds the largest number of ocean corals in the world with active research leading to the discovery of new corals.

=== Sea Turtle Rescue ===
MOC Marine Institute (MOCMI) works in partnership with NOAA Fisheries to coordinate the response to sick, injured, distressed, or expired sea turtles on the island of Maui, Hawaiʻi. All MOCMI sea turtle stranding response and rescue activities authorized under NOAA Permit: 21260. Sea turtles are rehabilitated and released back to the ocean after they have received proper care.

==Criticism==
The nonprofit organization For the Fishes has accused the Maui Ocean Center of repeatedly violating state-issued permits to take fish from the ocean. A compliance review by For the Fishes for the center&#x27;s 2022-2023 special permit identified 91 instances of improper marine life removals, with a reported mortality rate of over 50% within one year of capture. During 2021-2022, the Maui Ocean Center collected 802 fish; by the end of the permit year, 548 (68%) had died and 14 (less than 2%) had been returned to the ocean. Despite these findings, the Division of Aquatic Resources renewed the aquarium&#x27;s permit in June 2024, increasing the allowable fish take to 1,381 specimens - the largest such permit in the state of Hawaii - and adding an “opportunistic collection” clause that allows for subsequent permits to take unregulated marine life.
