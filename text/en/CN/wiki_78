<text>This is a seat by seat list of candidates in the 2004 Canadian election.

For more information about the election see 2004 Canadian federal election.

==2004 federal redistribution==
Due to the 2001 census, Canada&#x27;s 301 electoral districts increased to 308 as of April 1, 2004. Boundary changes took effect across the country to even out population redistribution, and seven new districts were formed. Each province has a minimum number of seats, and therefore it is rare for a province to lose seats in a redistribution. The numbers beside the region names correspond to the map below.

==Candidates and ridings==

All candidate names are those on the official list of confirmed candidates; names in media or on party website may differ slightly.

Names in bold represent party leaders and cabinet ministers.
† represents that the incumbent chose not to run again.
§ represents that the incumbent was defeated for nomination.
‡ represents that the incumbent ran in a different district.
@ represents that the candidate was automatically granted the nomination by party leader.

Nominations closed on June 7, 2004. Elections Canada released a final candidate list on June 9.

===Quebec===

Throughout most of recent history, the Liberals have dominated in federal politics in Quebec, even when Quebec voters were simultaneously electing the &quot;Parti Québécois&quot; at the provincial level.

There have been temporary Progressive Conservative breakthroughs under Diefenbaker in the 1958 election, and under native son Brian Mulroney in the 1984 election and the 1988 election, but these did not last. The 1958 result was helped by an alliance with Maurice Duplessis&#x27;s formidable provincial electoral machine. But by the 1962 election, Duplessis had died and his &quot;Union Nationale&quot; party was out of office and in disarray, and Diefenbaker&#x27;s support in Quebec had evaporated. The Mulroney-era resurgence also collapsed entirely when he retired from politics.

The &quot;Bloc Québécois&quot; was formed for the 1993 election in the aftermath of the failure of the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord, and has won more seats in Quebec than the Liberals in every election it has run in. The number of seats won by the Bloc has declined in each successive election from 1993 to 1997 to 2000. The party has now had a resurgence due to the sponsorship scandal and the unpopularity of Jean Charest&#x27;s provincial Liberal government, which influences support for the federal Liberals even though the two parties are independent of one another.

Polls show the Bloc with a strong lead, and they may return to the number of seats they had in 1993. However, the Liberals are likely to dominate in many parts of Montreal. Ridings where Anglophone voters are a significant factor are among the safest Liberal seats in all of Canada.

The other two major federal parties, the Conservatives and the New Democratic Party (NDP) are not expected to win any seats and are struggling to move out of single digits in the polls. The NDP in particular has historically never had any electoral success in Quebec up to that point.

===Ontario===
 Ontario was predicted to be the battle ground of this election. Most pundits believed that this is where the election was lost for the Conservatives. Ontario is home to more than one third of all of Canada&#x27;s ridings. In the last three elections, right wing vote splitting has resulted in just six riding losses for the Liberals, compared to 299 riding wins. However, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives have merged, and they should win many seats in Ontario, especially in rural ridings in midwestern Ontario, Central-eastern Ontario, and Central Ontario. The NDP has some support in various pockets in Ontario in the past, but has only won one riding in the last three elections, and one more in a by-election, both in Windsor. However, the NDP was expected to do well not only in Windsor, but in Hamilton, Downtown Toronto, Ottawa Centre, and possibly even in Northern Ontario.

===Manitoba===
 Manitoba is traditionally split between the NDP, the Liberals, and the Conservatives. This is especially true in the city of Winnipeg where most Manitobans live. However, due to vote splitting in recent elections, neither the Progressive Conservatives or the Canadian Alliance/Reform Party have been able to win in Winnipeg. In rural Manitoba, the Liberals are usually shut out of elections (exception in 1993). Conservative support is normally in the more populous south, with NDP support in the sparsely populated north, which usually only means one seat.

===Saskatchewan===
 In terms of party lines, Saskatchewan is not divided up between north and south but by urban and rural. Traditionally, Saskatchewan has been a two-way race between the Conservatives, and later the Reform/Alliance and the NDP. Recent vote splitting has allowed the Liberals to come through and win a few seats in this polarized province. Urban Saskatchewan has tended to vote NDP and rural Saskatchewan has tended to vote Conservative. This is especially true in provincial politics, where riding boundaries more reflect the urban/rural divide. Both Saskatoon and Regina, Saskatchewans largest cities are split into 4 ridings each. All eight of these ridings are generally split evenly between rural and urban. Northern Saskatchewan has in the past been the stand-alone region of rural Saskatchewan, usually voting for the NDP.

===Alberta===
 Alberta is unarguably the most Conservative province in Canada. You need only look at the results of the ridings here in the last century to prove this. Alberta has long been a Progressive Conservative province, but with the collapse of the party in 1993, Albertans went to the Reform Party of Canada (later the Canadian Alliance) for their vote. Edmonton seems to be the only exception to this. The Liberals have won in Edmonton six times since 1993, and the NDP has won in Edmonton as well.

===British Columbia===
 British Columbia is what many pundits consider to be the complete opposite of a bellwether region. British Columbia has a history of voting against the government. This has meant the NDP in the 1980s and the Reform/Canadian Alliance in the 1990s. More recently, regional trends have started to appear in B.C. The interior votes very Conservative, as the Canadian Alliance swept this area in 2000. B.C. has in the past been a province that would swing from one extreme to the other going for the right wing Social Credit to the left wing NDP in the past, in not only federal elections but provincial elections. The NDP also does well in British Columbia, or at least has in the past. Recently, they have been reduced to seats in the Vancouver area. There is hope that they will return to more traditional NDP seats on Vancouver Island, and in the interior. The Liberals have also won a few seats in B.C. recently, an area they have traditionally done very poor. Their strengths are in Victoria and in Vancouver.

<doc id="1257095" wikidata="Q3114011" url="?curid=1257095" title="Hilda Ellis Davidson">
<text>Hilda Roderick Ellis Davidson (born Hilda Roderick Ellis; 1 October 1914 – 12 January 2006) was an English folklorist. She was a scholar at the University of Cambridge and The Folklore Society, and specialized in the study of Celtic and Germanic religion and folklore.

A graduate of Newnham College, Cambridge, Davidson was a Fellow at Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge, throughout much of her career. She specialized in the interdisciplinary study of Celtic, Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse religion and folklore, on which she was the author of numerous influential works. Davidson was a prominent member of The Folklore Society, and played an active role in the growth of folklore studies as a scientific discipline. Throughout her career, Davidson tutored a significant number of aspiring scholars in her fields of study, and was particularly interested in encouraging gifted women to pursue scholarly careers.

==Early life and education==
Hilda Ellis Davidson was born in Bebington, Cheshire, England, on 1 October 1914, the daughter of Henry Roderick (a stationer) and Millie Cheesman Ellis.

Davidson received a First Class Honours degree in English, archaeology and anthropology from Newnham College, Cambridge. She gained both her M.A. (1939) and PhD (1940) at Newnham. Her PhD thesis was on Old Norse religion. Davidson would eventually become proficient in many languages, including Old Norse, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic, Russian, Latin and German.

==Early career==
Davidson began her academic career as an assistant lecturer in English at Royal Holloway, University of London (1939–1944). Her first book &quot;The Road to Hel: A Study of the Conception of the Dead in Old Norse Literature&quot; (1943), published under her maiden name Hilda Ellis, utilized archaeological evidence for the examination of death in Norse paganism. This was a pioneering approach, as the study of Old English and Old Norse in British academia at the time was strictly concerned with literary and linguistic concerns. Davidson&#x27;s utilization of an interdisciplinary approach to the study of Old Norse religion was to become a strong characteristic of her research. From 1945 to 1955 she was a lecturer in the extramural department at Birkbeck, University of London.

Although encountering a significant amount of opposition to her attempt at combining archaeological and philological evidence for the study of Old Norse and wider Germanic religion, Davidson continued with her research. In subsequent years, she published a number of influential works, including &quot;The Sword in Anglo-Saxon England&quot; (1962), &quot;Gods and Myths of Northern Europe&quot; (1964), &quot;Pagan Scandinavia&quot; (1967), and &quot;Scandinavian Mythology&quot; (1969). With Peter Gelling, she published &quot;The Chariot of the Sun&quot; (1969). During this time, Davidson contributed many papers to scholarly journals, where she often drew on her knowledge of myth, legend and folklore to interpret archaeological finds. She received a research award from the Leverhulme Trust in 1964 for her work in the Soviet Union.

==Return to Cambridge==

From 1968 to 1971, Davidson was a Calouste Gulbenkian Research Fellow at Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge. After 1971 she was Lecturer, and after 1974 Fellow, in Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic at Lucy Cavendish. She was vice president at Lucy Cavendish from 1975 to 1980. She was deeply involved in the expansion and modernization of Lucy Cavendish. During this time she also published several influential works, including &quot;The Viking Road to Byzantium&quot; (1976) and &quot;The History of the Danes: Saxo Grammaticus&quot; (1979–1980). At Cambridge Davidson ran the Cambridge Folklore Group, and was known as an active and lively speaker.

==Work for The Folklore Society==
Davidson had joined The Folklore Society in 1949, and was a member of its council (later Committee) from 1956 to 1986, subsequently becoming an honorary member. As a leading member of the Society, she played an active role in restoring the field of folklore studies as a scientific discipline. Davidson was actively involved in encouraging the modernization and democratization of the Society. Notable friends whom she worked with in this regard include Katharine Briggs and Stewart Sanderson. These efforts culminated in the election of Katharine Briggs as president and Venetia Newall as Secretary of the Society in 1967. In the subsequent years, Davidson was publications officer of the society, supervised the newly formed Mistletoe Books series, organized conferences, and edited or co-edited the papers that were produced as a result.

Davidson was herself President of the Society from 1974 to 1976, during which the Society prospered. Its constitution was rewritten, and the output of its journal, &quot;Folklore&quot;, significantly expanded in both volume and quality. Davidson&#x27;s efforts to modernize the Society are memorized in her &quot;Changes in the Folklore Society, 1949–1986&quot; (1987), which were published originally in &quot;Folklore&quot;. Apart from her membership in The Folklore Society, Davidson was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

==Later career==
In her later career, Davidson was particularly interested in exploring themes and beliefs common in both early Celtic and Germanic culture. Books produced as a result include &quot;Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe&quot; (1988), &quot;Lost Beliefs of Northern Europe&quot; (1993), and &quot;Roles of the Northern Goddesses&quot; (1998). She received the Coote Lake Medal for Folklore Research in 1984. Davidson helped endow the Katharine Briggs Folklore Award in 1982, which she herself received in 1988 for her &quot;Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe&quot; (1988).

Davidson also dedicated herself to examining the history of folklore studies itself. In this connection, together with Carmen Blacker, she edited &quot;Women and Tradition: A Neglected Group of Folklorists&quot; (2000). In 1987, Davidson helped found the Katharine Briggs Dining Club. She organized many of its conferences, and edited the papers that were produced as a result, often in cooperation with Blacker and Anna Chaudhri. In 1988 she published a biography of her friend Katharine Briggs. The last of her editorial projects, &quot;A Companion to the Fairy Tale&quot; (2003), was conducted in cooperation with Chaudhri.

==Personal life==
On 27 December 1943, Davidson married Richard Robertson Davidson, a research scientist, with whom she had two children. Davidson was a member of the Liberal Party and the Church of England. She was actively involved in church life as a churchwarden and bell-ringer.

==Death and legacy==
Davidson died on 12 January 2006. Her funeral was held in St Bene&#x27;t&#x27;s Church in Cambridge on 21 January 2006. She was survived by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

At the time of her death, Davidson had for many decades been a highly distinguished scholar in Old Norse religion and mythology. She helped extend both popular and scholarly interest in the fields of Norse, Germanic and Celtic mythology. She played an important role in the post-war revival of folklore studies, and in establishing the study of British folklore as a scientific discipline. Several of her works were translated into multiple languages, including Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Dutch and Japanese. Her efforts to encourage interdisciplinary research combining archaeology, literature, folklore and history was highly important. She was a tutor of a large number of scholars in mythology and folklore, and was particularly devoted to encouraging the scholarly careers of gifted women.

<text>Bjarne Bent Rønne Pedersen, known as Bjarne Liller (25 September 1935 – 6 September 1993), was a Danish jazz musician and singer-songwriter.

==Biography==
Liller was born on Vesterbro, Copenhagen. He got his breakthrough as a banjo player and singer in Papa Bue&#x27;s Viking Jazz Band.

He played with the Viking Jazz Band from 1956–70, and again from 1976-79, and made around 30 records with the band. He was also a successful solo artist, mainly in the pop music genre. He worked with John Mogensen, and got a gold record for selling 100,000 copies of his solo pop hit &quot;Billet mrk./Ensom dame 40 år&quot;.

He finished second at the 1979 Dansk Melodi Grand Prix, singing the duet &quot;&quot;Alt er skønt&quot; with Grethe Ingmann. Liller received a silver record for 25,000 copies sold of each of his two albums &quot;Man kan ikke gøre for, at man har charme&quot; (1975) and &quot;Livet er skønt&quot;&quot; (1976).

He appeared in three Danish films; as a singer in &quot;Thorvald og Linda&quot; (1982), and in minor roles in Erik Clausen&#x27;s films &quot;Den store badedag&quot; (1991) and &quot;De frigjorte&quot; (1993).

Liller credited Kim Larsen and Erik Clausen for re-igniting his passion for music during the last years of his life. He was active until his death in September 1993.

A sold-out benefit concert was held by his former jazz colleagues at the Tivoli Gardens later that month.

<text>Blumberg&#x27;s sign (also referred to as rebound tenderness or Shchetkin–Blumberg&#x27;s sign) is a clinical sign in which there is pain upon removal of pressure rather than application of pressure to the abdomen. (The latter is referred to simply as &quot;abdominal tenderness&quot;.) It is indicative of peritonitis. It was named after German surgeon Jacob Moritz Blumberg.

==Procedure==
The abdominal wall is compressed slowly and then rapidly released. A positive sign is indicated by presence of pain upon removal of pressure on the abdominal wall.

==Clinical significance==
The sign indicates aggravation of the parietal peritoneum by stretching or moving. Positive Blumberg&#x27;s sign is indicative of peritonitis, which can occur in diseases like appendicitis, and may occur in ulcerative colitis with rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant.

However, in recent years the value of rebound tenderness has been questioned, since it may not add any diagnostic value beyond the observation that the patient has severe tenderness. Use of the sign has been supported by others. A study published in 2022 found that a positive Blumberg&#x27;s sign made the diagnosis of acute appendicitis more likely, but that a negative sign did not rule out the diagnosis. In that sense, a positive Blumberg&#x27;s sign serves as a tool to supplement clinical diagnosis.

<doc id="1257111" wikidata="Q159497" url="?curid=1257111" title="Destruction (band)">
<text>Destruction is a German thrash metal band formed in 1982. They have been credited as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of the German thrash metal scene, the others being Kreator, Sodom and Tankard. In addition to helping pioneer black metal, Destruction was part of the second wave of thrash metal in the mid-to-late 1980s, along with US bands Testament, Sacred Reich, Death Angel and Dark Angel. For most of the 1990s, the band was not signed to a record label and self-produced their albums until they signed a contract with Nuclear Blast in the early 2000s.

== History ==
The band was formed in Weil am Rhein as Knight of Demon in 1982, inspired by Iron Maiden, Mercyful Fate, Motörhead and Venom. The line-up featured Ulf Kühne on vocals, Mike Sifringer on guitar, Marcel &quot;Schmier&quot; Schirmer on bass and Tommy Sandmann on drums. Kühne was kicked out of the band due to conflict with Sifringer over a girl, and Schmier took over vocal duties. They were then known as Destruction and released a demo titled &quot;Bestial Invasion of Hell&quot; on 10 August 1984. After this, the group signed with Steamhammer Records and released an EP titled &quot;Sentence of Death&quot; on 10 November.

Their first album &quot;Infernal Overkill&quot; was released in 1985, followed a year later by &quot;Eternal Devastation&quot;. The band was joined by a second guitarist, Harry Wilkens, and Sandmann was replaced by Oliver Kaiser. Together they recorded the EP &quot;Mad Butcher&quot; and their third studio album &quot;Release from Agony&quot; (both released in 1987), as well as the band&#x27;s first live album &quot;Live Without Sense&quot; (1989). During this time, Destruction had enjoyed considerable popularity worldwide, touring relentlessly in Europe and North America, and sharing the stage with Venom, Slayer, Kreator, Sodom, Celtic Frost, Motörhead, King Diamond, Voivod, Exodus, Testament, Overkill, Death Angel, Possessed, Sacred Reich, The Cro-Mags, Tankard, Flotsam and Jetsam, Artillery, Rage, Coroner, Assassin, Candlemass, Prong, Accu§er, Iron Angel, Wolfsbane and Girlschool.

During the initial recording sessions of the fourth album &quot;Cracked Brain&quot;, Schmier was fired from the band and was replaced by Poltergeist vocalist André Grieder, the only album with him. The album was released in 1990. Guitarist Mike Sifringer remained and continued to release material under the moniker of &quot;Neo-Destruction&quot;, featuring vocalist Thomas Rosenmerkel, second guitarist Michael Piranio, bassist Christian Engler and continuing drummer Oliver Kaiser. The first recording was the self-titled &quot;Destruction&quot; EP in 1994, followed a year later by the &quot;Them Not Me&quot; EP, and the band&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;The Least Successful Human Cannonball&quot; in 1998.

In 1999, the line-up was disassembled and Schmier rejoined with the addition of new drummer Sven Vormann, returning Destruction as a trio. They signed a record deal with Nuclear Blast and released three new albums; &quot;All Hell Breaks Loose&quot; in 2000, &quot;The Antichrist&quot; in 2001, and &quot;Metal Discharge&quot; in 2003, with Marc Reign replacing Vormann. The second live album &quot;Alive Devastation&quot; was released on 26 March 2003, followed by the release of a live DVD titled &quot;Live Discharge: 20 Years of Total Destruction&quot; on 4 March 2004. Reign was temporarily arrested on 24 May 2004 following the band&#x27;s performance in Brescia, due to the stage accessories, which was confiscated as a result. Destruction would then sign with AFM Records and release &quot;Inventor of Evil&quot; on 22 August 2005. That album was followed by a compilation album titled &quot;Thrash Anthems&quot; on 19 January 2007, featuring re-recorded material, and the next studio album &quot;D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.&quot; on 29 August 2008. The third live album &quot;The Curse of the Antichrist: Live in Agony&quot; was released 25 September 2009, followed by the second DVD release &quot;A Savage Symphony - The History of Annihilation&quot; on 29 January 2010.

Drummer Marc Reign would leave the band in 2010 and be replaced by Polish drummer Wawrzyniec &quot;Vaaver&quot; Dramowicz. On 18 February 2011, the twelfth album &quot;Day of Reckoning&quot; was released. The band&#x27;s thirteenth studio album &quot;Spiritual Genocide&quot; was released on 23 November 2012. Their next album &quot;Under Attack&quot; was released on 13 May 2016. Through an exclusive PledgeMusic campaign, Destruction released the sequel album to &quot;Thrash Anthems&quot; titled &quot;Thrash Anthems II&quot; on 18 July 2017, featuring more re-recordings of classic songs.

On 23 January 2018, Vaaver left Destruction &quot;for family reasons&quot;, according to Schmier. He took time off in 2015 to be with his family following the birth of his second child. Randy Black would temporarily replace him until the band finds a &quot;worthy successor&quot;. He was later announced as the band&#x27;s new drummer. On 28 February 2019, Swiss guitarist Damir Eskic joined the band. This new line-up recorded the fifteenth studio album &quot;Born to Perish&quot;, which was released on 9 August 2019. It is rooted in their traditional style of thrash metal and received good reviews. The fifth live album &quot;Born to Thrash&quot; was released on 8 May 2020.

On 16 July 2021, Destruction performed at the Area 53 Festival in Leoben without rhythm guitarist Mike Sifringer. Schmier explained in a Facebook post that Sifringer had not answered his emails and questioned his status, and that there was a problem that led to the decision to continue without him and would release a statement planned for 19 August. Sifringer&#x27;s departure was confirmed that day and was replaced by new guitarist Martin Furia, followed by the release of a new single titled &quot;State of Apathy&quot;, featuring the band&#x27;s first recording appearance with Furia. On 13 August, the sixth live album &quot;Live Attack&quot; was released. On 16 December, a music video of the title track from the sixteenth studio album &quot;Diabolical&quot; was released. The album was released on 8 April 2022 in celebration of the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

On 31 July 2023, it was announced that Destruction (along with Kreator, Sodom and Tankard) were on the bill for the Klash of the Ruhrpott festival, which took place on 20 July 2024 at Amphitheater Gelsenkirchen in Gelsenkirchen, making this the first time that all of the &quot;Big Teutonic Four&quot; bands had performed together.

On 6 June 2024, the band released a new single, titled &quot;No Kings - No Masters&quot;, in anticipation of their upcoming seventeenth studio album &quot;Birth of Malice&quot;, set to be released on 7 March 2025.

<doc id="1257114" wikidata="Q2111125" url="?curid=1257114" title="Hard coding">
<text>Hard coding (also hard-coding or hardcoding) is the software development practice of embedding data directly into the source code of a program or other executable object, as opposed to obtaining the data from external sources or generating it at runtime.

Hard-coded data typically can be modified only by editing the source code and recompiling the executable, although it can be changed in memory or on disk using a debugger or hex editor.

Data that is hard-coded is best suited for unchanging pieces of information, such as physical constants, version numbers, and static text elements.

Softcoded data, on the other hand, encodes arbitrary information through user input, text files, INI files, HTTP server responses, configuration files, preprocessor macros, external constants, databases, command-line arguments, and is determined at runtime.

==Overview==
Hard coding requires the program&#x27;s source code to be changed any time the input data or desired format changes, when it might be more convenient to the end user to change the detail by some means outside the program.

Hard coding is often required, but can also be considered an anti-pattern. Programmers may not have a dynamic user interface solution for the end user worked out but must still deliver the feature or release the program. This is usually temporary but does resolve, in a short term sense, the pressure to deliver the code. Later, softcoding is done to allow a user to pass on parameters that give the end user a way to modify the results or outcome.

The term &quot;hard-coded&quot; was initially used as an analogy to hardwiring circuits - and was meant to convey the inflexibility that results from its usage within software design and implementation.
In the context of run-time extensible collaborative development environments such as MUDs, hardcoding also refers to developing the core engine of the system responsible for low-level tasks and executing scripts, as opposed to softcoding which is developing the high-level scripts that get interpreted by the system at runtime, with values from external sources, such as text files, INI files, preprocessor macros, external constants, databases, command-line arguments, HTTP server responses, configuration files, and user input. In this case, the term is not pejorative and refers to general development, rather than specifically embedding output data.

== Hardcoding and backdoors ==
Hardcoding credentials is a popular way of creating a backdoor. Hardcoded credentials are usually not visible in configuration files or the output of account-enumeration commands and cannot be easily changed or bypassed by users. If discovered, a user might be able to disable such a backdoor by modifying and rebuilding the program from its source code (if source is publicly available), decompiling, or reverse-engineering software, directly editing the program&#x27;s binary code, or instituting an integrity check (such as digital signatures, anti-tamper, and anti-cheat) to prevent the unexpected access, but such actions are often prohibited by an end-user license agreement.

==Hardcoding and DRM==
As a digital rights management measure, software developers may hardcode a unique serial number directly into a program. Or it is common to hardcode a public key, creating the DRM for which it is infeasible to create a keygen.

On the opposite case, a software cracker may hard-code a valid serial number to the program or even prevent the executable from asking the user for it, allowing unauthorized copies to be redistributed without the need of entering a valid number, thus sharing the same key for every copy, if one has been hard-coded.

== Fixed installation path ==
If a Windows program is programmed to assume it is always installed to C:\Program Files\Appname and someone tries to install it to a different drive for space or organizational reasons, it may fail to install or to run after installation. This problem might not be identified in the testing process, since the average user installs to the default drive and directory and testing might not include the option of changing the installation directory. However, it is advisable for programmers and developers not to fix the installation path of a program, since the default installation path depends on the operating system, OS version, and sysadmin decisions. For example, many installations of Microsoft Windows use drive C: as their primary hard disk, but this is not guaranteed.

There was a similar issue with microprocessors in early computers, which started execution at a fixed address in memory.

==Startup disk==
Some &quot;copy-protected&quot; programs look for a particular file on a floppy disk or flash drive on startup to verify that they are not unauthorized copies. If the computer is replaced by a newer machine, which doesn&#x27;t have a floppy drive, the program that requires it now can&#x27;t be run since the floppy disk can&#x27;t be inserted.

This last example shows why hard coding may turn out to be impractical even when it seems at the time that it would work completely. In the 1980s and 1990s, the great majority of PCs were fitted with at least one floppy drive, but floppy drives later fell out of use. A program hard-coded in that manner 15 years ago could face problems if not updated.

==Special folders==
Some Windows operating systems have so called &quot;Special Folders&quot; which organize files logically on the hard disk. There are problems that can arise involving hard coding:

===Profile path===
Some Windows programs hard code the profile path to developer-defined locations such as codice_1. This is the path for the vast majority of Windows 2000 or above, but this would cause an error if the profile is stored on a network or otherwise relocated. The proper way to get it is to call the codice_2 function or to resolve the codice_3 environment variable. Another assumption that developers often make is assuming that the profile is located on a local hard disk.

===My Documents folder path===
Some Windows programs hardcode the path to codice_4 as codice_5. These programs would work on machines running the English version, but on localized versions of Windows this folder normally has a different name. For example, in Italian versions the codice_6 folder is named &quot;Documenti&quot;. codice_6 may also have been relocated using Folder Redirection in Group Policy in Windows 2000 or above. The proper way to get it is to call the codice_8 function.

==Solution==
An indirect reference, such as a variable inside the program called &quot;FileName&quot;, could be expanded by accessing a &quot;browse for file&quot; dialogue window, and the program code would not have to be changed if the file moved.

Hard coding is especially problematic in preparing the software for translation to other languages.

In many cases, a single hard-coded value, such as an array size, may appear several times within the source code of a program. This would be a magic number. This may commonly cause a program bug if some of the appearances of the value are modified, but not all of them. Such a bug is hard to find and may remain in the program for a long time. A similar problem may occur if the same hard-coded value is used for more than one parameter value, e.g. an array of 6 elements and a minimum input string length of 6. A programmer may mistakenly change all instances of the value (often using an editor&#x27;s search-and-replace facility) without checking the code to see how each instance is used. Both situations are avoided by defining constants, which associate names with the values, and using the names of the constants for each appearance within the code.

One important case of hard coding is when strings are placed directly into the file, which forces translators to edit the source code to translate a program. (There is a tool called codice_9 that permits strings to be left in files, but lets translators translate them without changing the source code; it effectively de-hard codes the strings.)

==Hard coding in competitions==

In computing competitions such as the International Olympiad in Informatics, contestants are required to write a program with specific input-output pattern according to the requirement of the questions.

In rare cases where the possible number of inputs is small enough, a contestant might consider using an approach that maps all possible inputs to their correct outputs. This program would be considered a hard-coded solution as opposed to an algorithmic one (even though the hard-coded program might be the output of an algorithmic program).

==Softcoding==
Softcoding is a computer coding term that refers to obtaining a value or function from some external resource, such as text files, INI files, preprocessor macros, external constants, configuration files, command-line arguments, databases, user input, HTTP server responses. It is the opposite of hardcoding, which refers to coding values and functions in the source code.

===Programming practice===
Avoiding hard coding of commonly altered values is good programming practice. Users of the software should be able to customize it to their needs, within reason, without having to edit the program&#x27;s source code. Similarly, careful programmers avoid magic numbers in their code, to improve its readability, and assist maintenance. These practices are generally not referred to as &quot;softcoding&quot;.

The term is generally used where softcoding becomes an anti-pattern. Abstracting too many values and features can introduce more complexity and maintenance issues than would be experienced with changing the code when required. Softcoding, in this sense, was featured in an article on The Daily WTF.

===Potential problems===
At the extreme end, soft-coded programs develop their own poorly designed and implemented scripting languages, and configuration files that require advanced programming skills to edit. This can lead to the production of utilities to assist in configuring the original program, and these utilities often end up being &#x27;softcoded&#x27; themselves.

The boundary between proper configurability and problematic soft-coding changes with the style and nature of a program. Closed-source programs must be very configurable, as the end user does not have access to the source to make any changes. In-house software and software with limited distribution can be less configurable, as distributing altered copies is simpler. Custom-built web applications are often best with limited configurability, as altering the scripts is seldom any harder than altering a configuration file. 

To avoid softcoding, consider the value to the end user of any additional flexibility you provide, and compare it with the increased complexity and related ongoing maintenance costs the added configurability involves.

===Achieving flexibility===
Several legitimate design patterns exist for achieving the flexibility that softcoding attempts to provide. An application requiring more flexibility than is appropriate for a configuration file may benefit from the incorporation of a scripting language. In many cases, the appropriate design is a domain-specific language integrated into an established scripting language. Another approach is to move most of an application&#x27;s functionality into a library, providing an API for writing-related applications quickly.

<text>Yelena Georgiyevna Bonner (; 15 February 1923 – 18 June 2011) was a human rights activist in the former Soviet Union and wife of the physicist Andrei Sakharov. During her decades as a dissident, Bonner was noted for her characteristic blunt honesty and courage.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Lusik Georgiyevna Alikhanova was born in Merv, Turkestan ASSR, Soviet Union (now Mary, Turkmenistan). She was born to Ruf &quot;Ruth&quot; Bonner, a Jewish communist activist from Siberia, and Levon Kacharyan, an Armenian. Her father died a year after her birth, and her mother remarried to Gevork Alikhanyan, founding First Secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia and a Comintern executive. She had a younger brother, Igor, who became a career naval officer. Her family had a summer dacha in Sestroretsk and Bonner had fond memories there.

In 1937, Bonner&#x27;s father was arrested by the NKVD and executed as part of Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge; her mother was arrested a few days later as the wife of an enemy of the people, and served ten years in the Gulag near Karaganda, Kazakhstan, followed by nine years of internal exile. Bonner&#x27;s 41-year-old maternal uncle, Matvei Bonner, was also executed during the purge, and his wife internally exiled. All four were exonerated (rehabilitated) following Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953. In 1941 she volunteered for the Red Army&#x27;s Hospital when the Soviet Union was invaded, and she became head nurse. While serving during World War II, Bonner was wounded twice, and in 1946 was honorably discharged as a disabled veteran. In 1947 Bonner was accepted as student in the medical institute in Leningrad. After the war she earned a degree in pediatrics from the First Leningrad Medical Institute, presently First Pavlov State Medical University of St. Peterburg.

===Marriage and children===
In medical school she met her first husband, Ivan Semyonov. They had a daughter, Tatiana, in 1950, and a son, Alexey, in 1956. Her children immigrated to the United States in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Bonner and Semyonov separated in 1965, and eventually divorced.

In October 1970, while attending the trial of human rights activists Revol&#x27;t (Ivanovich) Pimenov and Boris Vail in Kaluga, Bonner met Andrei Sakharov, a nuclear physicist and human rights activist; they married in 1972. The year before they met, 1969, Sakharov had been widowed from his wife, Klavdia Alekseyevna Vikhireva, with whom he had two daughters and a son.

===Activism===
Beginning as early as the 1940s, Bonner had helped political prisoners and their families. Although Bonner had joined the Soviet Communist Party in 1964 while she was working as a physician, only a few years later she was becoming active in the Soviet human rights movement. Her resolve towards dissidence was strengthened in August 1968 after Soviet bloc tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia in order to crush the Prague Spring movement. That event strengthened her belief that the system could not be reformed from within.
At the Kaluga trial in 1970, Bonner and Sakharov met Natan Sharansky and began working together to defend Jews sentenced to death for attempting an escape from the USSR in a hijacked plane. Under pressure from Sakharov, the Soviet regime permitted Yelena Bonner to travel to the West in 1975, 1977 and 1979 for treatment of her wartime eye injury. When Sakharov, awarded the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, was barred from travel by the Soviet authorities, Bonner, in Italy for treatment, represented him at the ceremony in Oslo.

Bonner became a founding member of the Moscow Helsinki Group in 1976. When in January 1980 Sakharov was exiled to Gorky, a city closed to foreigners, the harassed and publicly denounced Bonner became his lifeline, traveling between Gorky and Moscow to bring out his writings. Her arrest in April 1984 for &quot;anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda&quot; and sentence to five years of exile in Gorky disrupted their lives again. Sakharov&#x27;s several long and painful hunger strikes forced the new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev to let her travel to the U.S. in 1985 for sextuple bypass heart surgery. Prior to that, in 1981, Bonner and Sakharov went on a dangerous but ultimately successful hunger strike to get Soviet officials to allow their daughter-in-law, Yelizaveta Konstantinovna (&quot;Lisa&quot;) Alexeyeva, an exit visa to join her husband, Bonner&#x27;s son Alexei Semyonov, in the United States.

In December 1986, Gorbachev allowed Sakharov and Bonner to return to Moscow. Following Sakharov&#x27;s death on 14 December 1989, she established the Andrei Sakharov Foundation, and the Sakharov Archives in Moscow. In 1993, she donated Sakharov papers in the West to Brandeis University in the U.S.; in 2004 they were turned over to Harvard University. Bonner remained outspoken on democracy and human rights in Russia and worldwide. She joined the defenders of the Russian parliament during the August Coup and supported Boris Yeltsin during the constitutional crisis in early 1993.

In 1994, outraged by what she called &quot;genocide of the Chechen people&quot;, Bonner resigned from Yeltsin&#x27;s Human Rights Commission and was an outspoken opponent to Russian armed involvement in Chechnya and critical of the Kremlin for allegedly returning to KGB-style authoritarianism under Vladimir Putin. She was also critical of the international &quot;quartet&quot; two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict and expressed fears about the rise of antisemitism in Europe. In 1999, Yelena Bonner received the Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom.

Bonner was among the 34 first signatories of the online anti-Putin manifesto &quot;Putin must go&quot;, published 10 March 2010. Her signature was the first.

===Last years and death===
From 2006, Bonner divided her time between Moscow and the United States, home to her two children, five grandchildren, one great-granddaughter, and one great-grandson. She died on 18 June 2011 of heart failure in Boston, Massachusetts, aged 88, according to her daughter, Tatiana Yankelevich. She had been hospitalized since 21 February.

==Works and awards==
Bonner was the author of &quot;Alone Together&quot; (Knopf 1987), and &quot;Mothers and Daughters&quot; (Knopf 1992), and wrote frequently on Russia and human rights. She was a recipient of many international human rights awards, including the Rafto Prize in 1991, the European Parliament&#x27;s Robert Schuman Medal in 2001, the awards of International Humanist and Ethical Union, the World Women&#x27;s Alliance, the Adelaida Ristori Foundation, the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy, the Lithuanian Commemorative Medal of 13 January, the Czech Republic Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, and others.

She was also awarded the Giuseppe Motta Medal in 2004 for protection of human rights.

In 2005 Bonner participated in &quot;They Chose Freedom&quot;, a four-part television documentary on the history of the Soviet dissident movement. Bonner was on the Board of Advancing Human Rights (NGO).

==Depiction in media==
Bonner was portrayed by Glenda Jackson in the 1984 film &quot;Sakharov&quot;.

<text>The Snohomish River is a river in Snohomish County, Washington, formed by the confluence of the Skykomish and Snoqualmie rivers near Monroe. It flows northwest entering Port Gardner Bay, part of Puget Sound, between Everett and Marysville. The Pilchuck River is its main tributary and joins the river at Snohomish. The river system drains the west side of the Cascade Mountains from Snoqualmie Pass to north of Stevens Pass.

Measured at Monroe, the Snohomish River has an average annual flow of . In comparison, the Columbia River, Washington&#x27;s largest river, has an average flow of about .

==Course==
The Snohomish River forms at the confluence of the Snoqualmie and Skykomish Rivers just west of Monroe. Both of these rivers originate in the Cascades and drain the west slopes of the mountains in southeastern Snohomish County and northeastern King County. The Snohomish River flows generally northwestward from the confluence, passing under state route 522 and flowing alongside Lord Hill Regional Park before reaching downtown Snohomish. Here, it is joined by the Pilchuck River, its main tributary, and flows under state route 9. From Snohomish, the river continues northwestward through a broad floodplain, forming the eastern boundary of the city of Everett. The final few miles of the river in Everett form the Snohomish River estuary, a river delta that features wetlands and tideflats spread out across various islands and arms of the river. Several bridges carry U.S. Route 2, Interstate 5, and State Route 529 across the delta. The river then empties into Possession Sound, which is part of Puget Sound, between Everett and Marysville.

==Human history==

In November 2024, a ballot measure in the City of Everett proposed personhood and rights for the Snohomish River itself within the city limits. It was approved by voters and allows residents to file lawsuits on behalf of the river.

===Pollution===

The lower Snohomish River was a site of major industry during the 20th century that contaminated the area with various pollutants, including oil and fuel products from former mills and factories. An ore smelter operated by ASARCO contaminated soil and groundwater near the Snohomish River with arsenic. The river has also been used a site for illegal dumping of tires, litter, and batteries. The county government began a program to remove derelict vessels, including old boats, in the Snohomish River delta in 2018; by 2023, the program had removed 27 vessels that had leaked pollutants into the river.

<doc id="1257122" wikidata="Q1031998" url="?curid=1257122" title="Canada Reads">
<text>Canada Reads is an annual &quot;battle of the books&quot; competition organized and broadcast by Canada&#x27;s public broadcaster, the CBC. The program has aired in two distinct editions, the English-language &quot;Canada Reads&quot; on CBC Radio One, and the French-language on .

The English edition has aired each year since 2002, while the French edition aired annually from 2004 to 2014, and was then discontinued until being revived in 2018.

In 2021, sister service CBC Music launched &quot;Canada Listens&quot;, which used a similar format of advocates debating five classic albums by Canadian musicians. In 2023, CBC Kids introduced &quot;CBC Kids Reads&quot;, a feature which uses a similar format to highlight children&#x27;s picture books.

==Overview==
During &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, five personalities champion five different books, each champion extolling the merits of one of the titles. The debate is broadcast over a series of five programs. At the end of each episode, the panelists vote one title out of the competition until only one book remains. This book is then billed as the book that all of Canada should read.

CBC Radio producer Peter Kavanagh proposed the general idea of a national radio book campaign during the fall of 2001. Later that year, Talin Vartanian conceived &quot;Canada Reads&quot; and created the essential structure of the program: an annual campaign to select a book for the nation to read. She proposed the idea of five panelists, each championing a different title in a national on air debate. Vartanian was producer in the first edition (with Kavanagh), then she became executive producer from 2002 to 2007. In 2007 the program was an &quot;All Star Edition&quot;, a reunion of the winning panelists from the first five years. From 2007 to 2017, Ann Jansen produced the program.

&quot;Canada Reads&quot; was first broadcast on the CBC&#x27;s Radio One in 2002, and has aired annually on radio since then. The third and fourth editions also were broadcast on television, on CBC Newsworld. Broadcast dates were February 16 to February 20, 2004, and February 21 to February 25, 2005, respectively. The seventh edition was also broadcast on Bold TV, broadcasting from February 25 to February 29. Beginning with the third edition, the daily debates could be heard online as well as on Radio One. The fifth edition was broadcast from April 17 to April 21, 2006. The sixth edition aired February 25 to March 2, 2007. The seventh edition of &quot;Canada Reads&quot; was broadcast on February 25 to February 29, 2008, and for the first time, it was available as a podcast.

The books in the running for each edition of &quot;Canada Reads&quot; are announced several months before the programs are broadcast. Titles must be Canadian fiction, poetry or plays. They are promoted in bookstores, in the hope that the &quot;Canada Reads&quot; audience will purchase and read them all before the programs air. In some cases, publishers have published special editions of the nominated titles.

The publisher of the winning &quot;Canada Reads&quot; title donates a portion of sales proceeds from the winning book to a charitable organization working in the field of literacy. Recipients have included Frontier College, the Movement for Canadian Literacy, ABC Life Literacy Canada (formerly ABC CANADA Literacy Foundation) and Laubach Literacy of Canada.

Beginning in 2004, Radio-Canada, the French-language service of the CBC, produced a French version of &quot;Canada Reads&quot; entitled &quot;Le Combat des livres&quot; (&quot;Battle of the books&quot;). It was broadcast on Première Chaîne until 2014, following which it was discontinued for three years until being revived in 2018.

Both the English and French programs sometimes, but not always, include one personality more commonly associated with the other language community, who champions a translated work. One advocate, Maureen McTeer, has appeared on both programs in the same year, championing the same novel in both its original English and translated French editions. Several other novels have also been chosen for both programs, although their English and French versions were not chosen by the same advocate or in the same year; one novel to date, Lawrence Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Negroes&quot; (French title &quot;Aminata&quot;) has won both competitions.

==2002==
Canada Reads 2002 aired from April 16 to 19, 2002. The winning title was announced on April 23, 2002, Canada Book Day. Mary Walsh was the moderator.

==2011==
Canada Reads 2011 aired from February 7 to 10, 2011. The producers announced a slightly different format for the 2011 contest. Throughout the month of October 2010, an online vote was held to determine the books that listeners consider the 40 &quot;most essential&quot; Canadian novels of the past decade, and the panelists made their choices from within that list. Only novels, not short story collections, were eligible; however, novels which have previously been included in a &quot;Canada Reads&quot; competition were still eligible for renomination.

==2012==
The books for this edition were all non-fiction. A list of 40 non-fiction books were announced as being the shortlist finalists in October 2011, including &quot;And No Birds Sang&quot; by Farley Mowat, &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot; by Romeo Dallaire, &quot;The Last Spike&quot; by Pierre Berton, &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot; by Jane Jacobs and &quot;&quot; by Margaret MacMillan. Listeners could vote on up to five books they wanted to be shortlisted. The debates aired from February 6 to 9, 2012. Jian Ghomeshi moderated the competition.

On the first day of discussions, panelist Anne-France Goldwater &quot;caused shock and outrage among literary types&quot; (according to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;) by calling Carmen Aguirre &quot;a bloody terrorist&quot; and alleging that Marina Nemat &quot;tells a story that&#x27;s not true&quot;. In response, Marina Nemat posted on Facebook, &quot;I hope [Goldwater] can produce evidence to back up her claims. If not, I would like to receive a public apology from her.&quot; Nemat&#x27;s &quot;Prisoner of Tehran&quot; was the first voted off, with Stacey McKenzie casting a tie-breaking vote. Arlene Dickinson (the panelist defending &quot;Prisoner of Tehran&quot;) called McKenzie&#x27;s vote &quot;the wrong choice for the wrong reason&quot;.

==2013==
The theme for 2013 was &quot;Turf Wars&quot;, with the advocates and titles chosen to each represent one of Canada&#x27;s major geographic regions (British Columbia, the Prairies, Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces).

The debates were originally slated to take place from March 16 to 19; however, as the debates normally take place in a theatre in front of a live audience, they were postponed to a later date in light of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. In the interim, the CBC produced a series of five specials, one profiling each of the five nominated books through interviews with both the writer and the advocate, to air in place of the original debates.

In July, it was announced that the debates would take place in the week of July 20 to 23.

==2021==

The 2025 edition will take place from March 17 to 20, on the theme of &quot;books that change how we see, share and experience the world around us&quot;. The competing titles and advocates were announced on January 23.

==Success==
As a vehicle to promote interest in reading and books and to increase sales, &quot;Canada Reads&quot; has been a signal success. Even already successful titles see increases in sales driven by their inclusion in the contest: sales of Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s &quot;In the Skin of a Lion&quot; increased by 80,000 in 2002, the year of its appearance on &quot;Canada Reads&quot;. Its publisher, Random House of Canada attributed much of this increase to &quot;Canada Reads&quot;.

The success for lesser known titles can be as marked. Hubert Aquin&#x27;s &quot;Next Episode&quot; sold 18,500 copies in the year when it won &quot;Canada Reads&quot;.

For the 2005 edition, sales of Jacques Poulin&#x27;s &quot;Volkswagen Blues&quot;, which usually are about 200 copies a year, increased to 7,500 between the time the nominations were announced and the shows began airing. During the same period, 7,000 copies of Frank Parker Day&#x27;s &quot;Rockbound&quot; were shipped by its publisher, the University of Toronto Press.

Various community groups have also created local events that highlight the &quot;Canada Reads&quot; shortlist; for instance, the Greater Sudbury Public Library in Sudbury has staged several editions of &quot;Sudbury Reads&quot;, an event where members of the community discuss and debate that year&#x27;s &quot;Canada Reads&quot; titles to arrive at a selection of the city&#x27;s own favourite &quot;Canada Reads&quot; book.

==Criticism==
There has been some criticism of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;. First, criticism has been made of the use of &quot;celebrity&quot; panelists. In 2007, a listener named John Mutford unsuccessfully attempted to become the first non-celebrity panelist. Critics have also taken issue with the game show format, and have contended that discussion of the books has often remained on a superficial level.

The choice of books has also been criticized. Originally each panelist provided a list of five books, from which the producers chose the final contenders. In 2005, this process changed, and each panelist submitted only one choice. Due to scheduling problems, Rufus Wainwright was not able to appear after selecting his choice, and singer Molly Johnson was chosen to defend his chosen book.

<doc id="1257123" wikidata="Q1141055" url="?curid=1257123" title="Diverticulum">
<text>In medicine or biology, a diverticulum is an outpouching of a hollow (or a fluid-filled) structure in the body. Depending upon which layers of the structure are involved, diverticula are described as being either true or false.

In medicine, the term usually implies the structure is not normally present, but in embryology, the term is used for some normal structures arising from others, as for instance the thyroid diverticulum, which arises from the tongue.

The word comes from Latin &quot;dīverticulum&quot;, &quot;bypath&quot; or &quot;byway&quot;.

==Classification==
Diverticula are described as being true or false depending upon the layers involved:

*False diverticula (also known as &quot;pseudodiverticula&quot;) do not involve muscular layers or adventitia. False diverticula, in the gastrointestinal tract for instance, involve only the submucosa and mucosa, such as Zenker&#x27;s diverticulum. False diverticula are typically synonymous with pulsion diverticula, which describes the mechanism of formation as increased intraluminal pressure.
*True diverticula involve all layers of the structure, including muscularis propria and adventitia, such as Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum. True diverticula are typically synonymous with traction diverticula, which describes the mechanism of formation as pulling forces external to the structure.

==Embryology==
*The kidneys are originally diverticula in the development of the urinary and reproductive organs.
*The lungs are originally diverticula forming off of the ventral foregut.
*The thymus appears in the form of two flask-shape diverticula, which arise from the third branchial pouch (pharyngeal pouch) of the endoderm.
*The thyroid gland develops as a diverticulum arising from a point on the tongue, demarcated as the foramen cecum.

==Human pathology==
=== Gastrointestinal tract diverticula ===
*Esophageal diverticula may occur in one of three areas of the esophagus:
:#Pharyngeal (Zenker&#x27;s) diverticula usually occur in the elderly, through Killian&#x27;s triangle between the thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus muscle of the inferior pharyngeal constrictors.
:#Midesophageal diverticula
:#Epiphrenic diverticula are due to dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter, as in achalasia.
*A duodenal diverticulum can be found incidentally in 23% of normal people undergoing imaging. It can be either congenital or acquired, but the acquired form is more common and is due to the weakness of the duodenal wall, which causes protrusions. It is usually found at the second or third part of duodenum, around the ampulla of Vater. Food debris may enter the diverticular outpouchings, causing inflammation or diverticulitis. On CT or MRI imaging, it appears as a sac-like outpouching. If the diverticulum is filled with contrast agents, the wall would be thin and may contain air, fluid, contrast material, or food debris. If the food debris is broken down by bacteria, the outpouching may show &quot;faeces sign&quot;. Inflammation of the duodenal wall shows thickening of the wall. Rarely, on barium studies in congenital duodenal diverticula, the contrast material fills up the true lumen, causing &quot;windsock&quot; deformity.
*A jejunal diverticulum is a congenital lesion and may be a source of bacterial overgrowth. It may also perforate or result in abscesses.
*A Killian-Jamieson diverticulum is very similar to a pharyngeal esophageal diverticulum, differing in the fact that the pouching is between the oblique and transverse fibers of the cricopharyngeus muscle.
*A Laimer diverticulum is an outpouching that occurs in the Laimer triangle between the cricopharyngeus and superior esophageal circular muscle.
*Colonic diverticula, although found incidentally during colonoscopy, may become infected (see diverticulitis) and can perforate, requiring surgery.
*Gastric diverticula are very infrequent.
*Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum, a persistent portion of the omphalomesenteric duct, is present in 2% of the population, making it the most common congenital gastrointestinal malformation.

*Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses are diverticula in the gallbladder due to chronic cholecystitis

Most of these pathological types of diverticula are capable of harboring an enterolith. If the enterolith stays in place, it may cause no problems, but a large enterolith expelled from a diverticulum into the lumen can cause obstruction.

=== Genito-urinary tract diverticula ===
*Bladder diverticula are balloon-like growths on the bladder commonly associated with chronic outflow obstruction, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia in older males. Usually found in pairs on opposite sides of the bladder, bladder diverticula are often surgically removed to prevent infection, rupture, or even cancer.
*Calyceal diverticula are usually asymptomatic, but if a stone becomes lodged in the outpouching, they may present with pain.
*Urethral diverticula are usually found in women aged 30 to 70 years old, in between 1 and 6% of adult women. Since most cases are without any symptoms, the true incidence is unknown. Symptoms may vary from frequent urinary tract infections, painful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), or symptoms due to cancer. A urethral diverticulum is located on the anterior vaginal wall, 1 to 3 cm inside the vaginal introitus. MRI is preferred as the imaging method of choice due to its excellent soft-tissue resolution. On T2-weighted imaging, it shows a high signal in the diverticulum due to the presence of fluid inside it. Vaginal ultrasonography is highly sensitive in diagnosing the diverticulum, but it is strongly dependent on the skills of the operator.

=== Other diverticula ===
*A diverticulum of Kommerell is an outpouching (aneurysm) of the aorta where an aberrant right subclavian artery is located. It is unusual nomenclature, in that focal dilatations of a blood vessel are properly referred to as aneurysms.
*Cardiac diverticulum is a very rare congenital malformation of the heart that is usually benign.

<doc id="1257124" wikidata="Q6828289" url="?curid=1257124" title="Michael Astor">
<text>The Hon. Michael Langhorne Astor (10 April 1916 – 28 February 1980) was a British Conservative Party politician.

==Early life==
Michael Astor was born on 10 April 1916. He was the fourth child of Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor, and Nancy Witcher Langhorne, both Members of Parliament. He attended prep school at St. Michael&#x27;s, Uckfield, where he was a contemporary of the future writer and painter Denton Welch, who later included him in a short story. He was educated at Eton College and gained the rank of captain, serving in the Royal Artillery (Territorial Army). He served as an officer during WW2 in &quot;Phantom&quot; GHQ Liaison Regiment.

==Career==
He was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament for Surrey East in the 1945 general election. He kept his seat in the 1950 election but did not stand in 1951. He wrote a memoir, &quot;Tribal Feeling&quot;, published in 1963, and a novel, &quot;Brand&quot;, published in 1968.

==Personal life==
Astor married three times:
* Barbara McNeill (1942–1961), with whom he had four children. 
* Pandora Clifford (1961–1968). Annabel Jones, his stepdaughter from his second marriage, married his nephew, William Astor, 4th Viscount Astor.
* Judith Innes (1970–1980), with whom he had a daughter, Polly in 1971. Polly has a daughter, Martha West, with actor Dominic West.

A fugitive from the United States, he murdered police constable (PC) Ian Broadhurst and attempted to murder PCs Neil Roper and James Banks on 26 December 2003 in Leeds, England, sparking a nationwide search before he was captured. He was given a whole life sentence after being found guilty of murder in December 2004 and the trial judge recommended that he should never be released; however, in 2008 this sentence was reduced to a minimum term of 37 years by the Court of Appeal, after which he could apply for parole.

==Florida shootings==

Bieber is originally from Fort Myers, Florida, the son of a middle school principal. After leaving school, he was briefly a US Marine before being discharged for going AWOL.

Bieber became a drug dealer and bodybuilder. On 9 February 1995 a fellow bodybuilder, Markus Mueller, was shot and killed in Fort Myers. Police arrested Bieber, thinking he had hired a hitman, but later released him due to lack of evidence. In November 1995, Bieber&#x27;s former girlfriend Michelle Marsh was attacked by the same gunman who had attacked Mueller. All four shots missed.

Bieber fled the state, assuming the identity of Nathan Wayne Coleman by stealing the identity of a deceased child who died in the 1970s, and escaped the country in 1996.

==Leeds police shootings==
Bieber entered the United Kingdom on 26 September 1996 through the port of Ramsgate, Kent using a false passport. He was given a six-month visa, but it was extended until his marriage to Denise Horsley in Kendal, Cumbria.

In 1998, Bieber arrived in Yorkshire, where he worked as a nightclub doorman. He also acquired an arsenal of illegal firearms. In 2001, his wife petitioned for divorce.

On 26 December 2003, on the border between the Gipton and Oakwood areas of Leeds, unarmed traffic policemen Ian Broadhurst and Neil Roper saw Bieber&#x27;s stolen BMW car parked at the junction of Grange Park Avenue and Dib Lane, where Bieber had just been into the adjacent post office.

They identified the number plates as false, and asked him to accompany them to the police car, where Bieber sat in the back seat. The officers did not attempt to search him or handcuff him. They became uneasy, however, and so called for backup.

Roper then moved to handcuff Bieber, who, facing imprisonment for various offences in the UK and possible extradition to the US, drew a 9 mm handgun and fired an initial four shots at the officers, who tried to flee. Roper was hit twice in the shoulder and abdomen, but managed to get away. Broadhurst was shot once in the back and immobilised. PC James Banks, who had arrived as backup, escaped injury after a bullet hit his radio. Bieber walked over to where Broadhurst was lying, and fired a fifth shot into his head at point blank range. It was the first fatal shooting of an English police officer for over eight years – preceded by that of PC Philip Walters of the Metropolitan Police, who was shot dead on 18 April 1995.

After the shootings, Bieber escaped down Dib Lane, and stole a car at gunpoint outside a betting shop further down the road. This caused some confusion in initial news reports of the shootings, which state that the shooting itself happened outside the betting shop.

==Nationwide search==
Following the shootings West Yorkshire Police launched a nationwide search for Bieber led by Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Gregg. On 27 December 2003, Bieber took a taxi journey in Bradford, and on 28 December, armed police raided Bieber&#x27;s apartment in Leeds.

Bieber was arrested by armed police at the Royal Hotel in Dunston, Gateshead at 2.25am on 31 December. He had dyed his hair ginger. Under his bed, he had a loaded pistol which was later determined to be the weapon used in the shooting, along with around 300 rounds of ammunition. The next day, he was charged with murder and two counts of attempted murder.

==Trial==
The trial was held at Newcastle Crown Court and ended on 2 December 2004. Bieber denied murder, two counts of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and possession of two hundred 9 mm pistol rounds found in a storage shed. Bieber admitted possession of 298 9mm rounds, found when arrested, without a firearms certificate.

The prosecution presented evidence from witnesses, identification of Bieber&#x27;s voice and DNA evidence. Bieber&#x27;s defence was that the culprit was his friend who looked like him, also from Florida, that committed the offences and had asked him to look after the murder weapon. Bieber said he could not name this friend for fear of reprisals.

Bieber was convicted on one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder. The judge, Mr Justice Moses, told Bieber he had shown &quot;no remorse or understanding of the brutality&quot; of his crime, and the aggravating feature in the case was that Bieber did not need to shoot Broadhurst through the head, noting:

Bieber was given three life sentences. The judge recommended that Bieber should never be released, making him only the 25th person in British legal history to be recommended for lifelong imprisonment.

Should he be released, the State of Florida, where he faces charges relating to the murder of Markus Mueller and the attempted murder of former girlfriend Michelle Marsh in 1995, has said it would seek his extradition.

==Appeals==
On 24 October 2006, the Court of Appeal rejected a bid from Bieber for his convictions to be overturned, but ruled he could appeal against the trial judge&#x27;s recommendation that he should never be released. The Appeal Court ruled that the whole life tariff was not in itself a violation of the provision in the European Convention on Human Rights against &quot;inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&quot;. In February 2007, it was announced that Bieber&#x27;s sentence appeal would be delayed due to a European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) review of that question; the ECHR ruled in January 2012, by a 4–3 majority, held there was no such violation.

Later in 2007, it was reported that Bieber was involved in an escape plot with two other prisoners.

On 23 July 2008, Bieber was told by the High Court that he would not have to serve a whole life term, as originally recommended by the trial judge, but would still have to serve a minimum of 37 years before being considered for parole, meaning he is set to remain in prison until at least 2041, when he will be 75 years old. Paul McKeever, chairman of the Police Federation, described the ruling as &quot;[leaving] the judiciary with blood on its hands&quot;.

== Prison officer attack and conviction ==
On 10 August 2017 Bieber attacked prison officer Alison Smith at HMP Long Lartin prison with a homemade weapon fashioned from an iron bar. At Worcester Crown Court he was given an additional life sentence, with a minimum six year additional term to run consecutively to the existing 37 year minimum term. Consequently, the minimum term is now 43 years and will run until 1 January 2047 when Bieber will be 80 years old.

<text>Strike Fighter Squadron 32 (VFA-32), nicknamed the &quot;Fighting Swordsmen&quot;, are a United States Navy strike fighter squadron presently flying the F/A-18F Super Hornet and based ashore at Naval Air Station Oceana. Their radio callsign is &quot;Gypsy&quot; and their tail code is &quot;AC&quot;. The Fighting Swordsmen of VFA-32 were the 2023 recipients of the Mutha Fighter Spirit Award, awarded annually at the Navy’s Strike Fighter Ball in Norfolk, VA. 

Their mission is: &quot;Strike Fighter Squadron 32, as a part of United States Naval Aviation, utilizes the F/A-18F aircraft to project power ashore and at sea, to defend the Fleet against air and sea threats and to carry out all other missions which may be assigned by cognizant authority.&quot;

== Insignia and nickname ==
Originally, the squadron used the Fighting Three &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; symbol and called themselves the &quot;Crazy Cats&quot; because so many pilots were from Fighting Three. At one time, the squadron was known as the &quot;White Lightning.&quot; In 1950, the squadron adopted the insignia of a traditional heraldry lion under Naval Aviation wings of gold and the motto &quot;Deus et Patria&quot; that has endured with only slight modernization through today. The VF-32 squadron radio callsign is &quot;Gypsy&quot; and most alumni refer to themselves as &quot;Gypsies&quot;. The squadron picked up the nickname &quot;Swordsmen&quot; after it switched to the F-8 Crusader and added a sword to the lion&#x27;s hand.

== History ==

=== 1940s ===
VFA-32 was established as Bombing Fighting Three (VBF-3) on 1 February 1945, flying the F6F Hellcat, when it was split off from VF-3, the famed Felix squadron. Fritz Wolf, a former member of the American Volunteer Group (AVG) or Flying Tigers, was assigned as the first VBF-3 commanding officer. At the time, U.S. Navy carriers were closing on the Japanese home islands and were facing aggressive Kamikaze attacks. VBF-3 was assigned to Carrier Air Group THREE on board in the Pacific theater. On 16 February 1945, VBF-3 pilots became the Navy&#x27;s first carrier-based pilots to strike the Japanese islands. During the heavy action on that day, the squadron shot down 24 Japanese aircraft, earning the Presidential Unit Citation.

On 15 November 1946, VBF-3 was redesignated VF-4A and switched to the F8F-1 Bearcat. On 7 August 1948, VF-4A became VF-32 and switched to the F4U Corsair.

=== 1950s ===

In 1950, the squadron were deployed to the Korean War with F4Us aboard . From October 1950 to January 1951, under the command of Richard L. Cevoli, VF-32 hit Korean targets including Wonsan Harbor, Puckchong, Chonjin, and Chosin Reservoir. On 4 December 1950, the aircraft of Ensign Jesse L. Brown, the first African-American aviator to complete the Navy&#x27;s basic flight training program, was hit by flak while supporting embattled Marines at Chosin. He crash-landed his Corsair behind enemy lines on a snow-covered mountain slope. His wingman, Lt. (j.g.) Thomas J. Hudner Jr., could see that Brown survived the forced landing, but appeared to be trapped in the cockpit with smoke coming from the engine compartment. In an attempt to save his squadron mate, Hudner crash-landed his own plane nearby. Hudner found Brown semi-conscious, and with the assistance of a responding helicopter pilot, attempted but was unable to extricate Brown from the crumpled fuselage. Although the attempted rescue failed, Hudner received the Medal of Honor and Brown received, posthumously, the Distinguished Flying Cross.
In November 1952, the squadron returned to the East Coast and became the first squadron to operate the swept-wing F9F-6 Cougar. VF-32 made subsequent deployments aboard in 1953 and the in 1955. In 1956, VF-32 became the first squadron to transition to the F8U-1 Crusader, thus becoming the first supersonic squadron in the Navy.

While deployed aboard as a unit of Carrier Air Group THREE, VF-32 participated in the 1958 Lebanon crisis.

=== 1960s ===

During the Cuban Missile Crisis in late 1962, VF-32 flew 96 sorties to support photo-reconnaissance flights and intelligence-gathering missions. After returning from cruise in 1965, the squadron changed homeport from NAS Cecil Field, Florida to NAS Oceana, Virginia, and switched to the F-4B Phantom II. VF-32 detached from Carrier Air Group THREE, ending a relationship that had lasted since the squadron&#x27;s establishment.

In June 1966, VF-32 embarked aboard as a component of Carrier Air Group ONE and sailed for Yankee Station in Southeast Asia. The squadron flew 940 combat sorties during three line periods in five months, building a highly successful Vietnam War combat record, losing no aircraft or aircrew. In May 1968, VF-32 deployed aboard for her maiden voyage.

=== 1970s ===

For service in October 1970, the squadron received the Meritorious Unit Commendation for actions in support of the United States Sixth Fleet operations during the Middle East Crisis.

In 1974, VF-32 switched to the F-14 Tomcat at NAS Miramar before moving to NAS Oceana as one of the first fleet Tomcat squadrons based there. VF-32 made the first Atlantic Fleet F-14 deployment in June 1975. On that cruise, VF-32 was awarded the Joseph Clifton Award as the Navy&#x27;s top fighter squadron.

In October 1977, VF-32 became the first fleet squadron to fly against the Air Force F-15 Eagle, setting the stage for regularly scheduled dissimilar air combat training between the Air Force and Navy. VF-32 again embarked for the Mediterranean aboard &quot;Kennedy&quot; in June 1978. During this deployment, VF-32 conducted the first fleet test and evaluation of the new Television Camera System. The squadron also deployed with AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles for the first fleet captive-carry evaluation. A mid-cruise missile exercise, &quot;BUZZARDEX&quot;, saw firings of AIM-54 Phoenix and AIM-7 Sparrow missiles at five targets moving at Mach 2.5. In October 1979, VF-32 completed 10 years of accident-free flying. In those 10 years, the squadron flew over 33,000 hours, including 17,000 in the F-14A.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, the squadron was again presented with the Admiral Clifton Award. In 1980 and 1981, the squadron achieved an accident-free Mediterranean deployment aboard &quot;Kennedy&quot;, followed in 1982 by another accident-free Med cruise aboard and the 1982 Commander, Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet Battle &quot;E&quot; and CNO Safety &quot;S&quot; awards. In 1982, three VF-32 Tomcats tail numbers 211, 212 and 214, were modified to carry the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System TARPS pod.

In 1983–84, the squadron completed the Navy&#x27;s first combat deployment since the Vietnam era with CVW-6 aboard &quot;Independence&quot;. VF-32 flew combat air patrol missions and provided TARPS imagery for 4 December 1983 CVW-6/CVW-3 air strikes on Syrian positions in Lebanon. VF-32 also flew missions in support of Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada providing pre- and post-battle damage assessment using photography from the TARPS pod. The deployment concluded with participation in NATO exercise &quot;TEAMWORK 84&quot; in the Norwegian Sea. The squadron made a third deployment aboard &quot;Independence&quot; from October 1984 through February 1985 to the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean.
The squadron rejoined CVW-3 in February 1985, and embarked aboard &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; in August 1986 for another Mediterranean deployment. This cruise saw the squadron&#x27;s Class &quot;A&quot; safety record extended another year, but also included the first night F-14 barricade landing. VF-32 participated in a variety of NATO and combined exercises, and extended their major mishap-free safety record to nine years during a 1988–89 Mediterranean deployment, again aboard &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;.

On 4 January 1989, while flying from &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; during a routine patrol over the Gulf of Sidra, two VF-32 F-14s intercepted two Libyan MiG-23 Floggers, which had originated from the Al Bumbai airfield in Tobruk. After attempting a peaceful intercept, the F-14s used their Television Camera System (TCS) to verify that the MiGs were armed. Hostile intent was declared and the aircraft were cleared to engage. The lead fired an AIM-7 Sparrow, which failed to track. His wingman also fired an AIM-7, which tracked and destroyed one of the MiGs, its pilot ejecting. The first F-14 then closed to AIM-9 Sidewinder range and downed the remaining MiG-23, whose pilot also ejected. The squadron returned to Virginia in February 1989.

VFA-32 appeared on an episode of CBS News 48 Hours entitled &quot;Super Carrier - USS Kennedy.&quot;

=== 1990s ===

When Kuwait was invaded by Iraqi forces in August 1990, VF-32 joined Carrier Air Wing 3, was put on emergency recall from Nellis AFB and returned to NAS Oceana to prepare to sortie with &quot;Kennedy&quot;. &quot;Kennedy&quot; immediately proceeded to the Red Sea to participate in Operation Desert Shield alongside . During Desert Shield, the ship made several Suez Canal transits and operated in the Eastern Mediterranean. When Desert Shield turned into Operation Desert Storm in January 1991, VF-32 Tomcats were in the first strike wave flying Combat Air Patrol mainly in central and western Iraq. VF-32 TARPS aircrews flew daily missions throughout Iraq including supersonic runs over highly defended Al Qa&#x27;im. Throughout Operation Desert Storm, VF-32 aircrew logged 1,445 combat flight hours on 403 missions, including 38 combat TARPS missions. After an eight-month deployment, the squadron returned to NAS Oceana on 28 March 1991. Later that year, the squadron won the 1991 AIRLANT Grand Slam missile firing competition with 17 of 17 scored kills.

VF-32 and &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; again deployed in October 1992. The squadron conducted a great deal of air-to-ground operations in the Adriatic Sea while on cruise in support of Operation Provide Promise, marking the beginning of the Tomcat strike/fighter mission and provided significant carrier air patrol support for C-130 food drop missions in the former Yugoslavia. The squadron returned home to NAS Oceana in April 1993 and throughout the summer conducted joint exercises with the Air Force and was coined the first &quot;Toms to Bomb&quot; squadron to fully certify the use of bombs on the F-14 platform. The year was highlighted with presentations of the Battle &quot;E&quot; and Clifton Awards to VF-32.

In May 1994, VF-32 and CVW-3 embarked aboard . This four-week deployment marked the first extensive at-sea period where women worked alongside men on a fleet aircraft carrier. In September, a small detachment provided TARPS photography and air support for Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti. In November 1994, VF-32 deployed aboard &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; for another tour in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The squadron flew missions over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch and over Bosnia-Herzegovina in support of Operation Deny Flight. 1995 marked fifty years of service from the men and women of VF-32. In November 1996, VF-32 and CVW-3 deployed on board for another tour in support of Operation Deny Flight and Operation Southern Watch over Bosnia and Iraq. The squadron brought digital imagery to the TARPS mission through new cameras that could take up to two hundred digital images and was able to store them on board or transmit them to appropriately equipped ground or sea-based receivers up to 300 kilometers away, resulting in a near-real-time reconnaissance capability. The squadron received the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its cutting edge work with Digital TARPS. In August 1997, VF-32 began transitioning from the F-14A to F-14B. In February 1998, the squadron received the F-14B Upgrade.

In November 1998, VF-32 and CVW-3 deployed aboard to the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean Sea to support Operation Southern Watch and Operation Deliberate Force. With Iraq’s failure to cooperate with United Nations inspections of known weapon sites, Operation Desert Fox was launched on 16 December 1998. VF-32 took part in a 33-aircraft strike package on 16 December. The first night of the four-day operation was conducted by the US Navy only. Over four days, VF-32 expended of ordnance during 16 strike missions and 38 sorties. During Desert Fox many Tomcat firsts were achieved, including the first GBU-24s dropped in combat by the US Navy, the first multiple GBU-24 drop by any platform in combat, the first combat use of the LANTIRN, the first autonomous F-14 delivery of a GBU-10/16/24, and the first F-14 use of Night Vision Devices in combat. The squadron returned home in May 1999.

=== 2000s ===

VF-32 deployed once again in November 2000 for the maiden voyage of the . They spent four months in support of Operation Southern Watch and returned home on 23 May 2001. In December 2002 VF-32 deployed once again on &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; in support of Operation Noble Eagle and Operation Northern Watch.

In support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) in 2003, VF-32 was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea aboard &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot;. VF-32 flew strike missions and missions in support of US Special Forces on the ground. VF-32 was involved in the worst friendly fire incident of the war when on 6 April 2003 a squadron F-14 crew was cleared to attack an Iraqi tank near Dibakan, south east of Mosul. Instead, they mistakenly dropped a single laser-guided bomb on a vehicle convoy consisting of US Special Forces and Kurdish resistance fighters, killing 18 Kurdish fighters, 4 US soldiers and a BBC translator. An additional 80 people were wounded. An investigation following the war found that the pilot had been cleared to drop without the benefit of target coordinates provided by the Forward Air Controller, who was &quot;operating under great stress&quot; at the time. Overall, VF-32 flew 275 sorties and expended 247 laser-guided bombs and 118 JDAM. In January 2004 VF-32 became the first operational squadron to attempt the launch of six AIM-54 Phoenix missiles from one aircraft. A launch such as this had not been attempted since 1972. Five of the six active radar missiles were successfully launched. VF-32 returned to NAS Oceana in May 2003.
In 2004 VF-32 deployed again in support of OIF, becoming the first Naval squadron to redeploy in support of OIF. The squadron delivered multiple precision guided munitions on insurgent hideouts using the LANTIRN pod in the urban Close Air Support environment. This would be the squadron&#x27;s final deployment with the F-14.

In October 2005, VF-32 transitioned to the F/A-18F Super Hornet and in November 2005 the squadron was designated Strike Fighter Squadron Thirty Two (VFA-32).

In November 2007, VFA-32 embarked on USS &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; for their first F/A-18F Super Hornet cruise, deploying to the Persian Gulf. VFA-32 and the rest of CVW-3 returned home on 4 June 2008. VFA-32 was awarded the Battle Effectiveness Award for maintaining the highest state of battle readiness and sustained superior performance in February 2009.

Throughout the 2010s, VFA-32 saw numerous deployments and conducted extensive combat operations in the Middle East with their F/A-18Fs.

In October 2023, VFA-32 began a combat deployment within Air Wing Three onboard the USS &quot;Dwight D Eisenhower&quot;. The deployment focused heavily within the CENTCOM AOR. For the majority of the deployment, VFA-32 operated from the Red Sea. Constant combat operations against Houthi-Iranian military units in Yemen and over the Red Sea occurred during the deployment. VFA-32 was heavily involved in defensive and offensive operations against Houthi-Iranian drones, as well as fixed and mobile targets. At some point in this deployment, which ended on July 14, 2024, a woman in VFA-32 became the first American female pilot to engage and kill an air-to-air contact.

<text>Boll weevils (named for the type of beetle which feeds on cotton buds) was an American political term used in the mid-to-late 20th century to describe conservative Democrats, particularly Southern Democrats.

== Background ==
During and after the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, conservative Southern Democrats were part of the coalition generally in support of the economic policies of Democratic presidents Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, dubbed the New Deal and Fair Deal respectively, but were opposed to desegregation and the civil rights movement.

On several occasions between 1948 and 1968, prominent conservative Southern Democrats broke from the Democrats to run a third party campaign for President on a platform of states&#x27; rights: Strom Thurmond in 1948, Harry F. Byrd in 1960, and George Wallace in 1968. In the 1964 presidential election, five states in the Deep South (then a Democratic stronghold) voted for Republican challenger Barry Goldwater over Southern Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson, partly due to Johnson&#x27;s support of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Goldwater&#x27;s opposition to it.

After 1968, with desegregation a settled issue, the Republican Party began a strategy of trying to win conservative Southerners from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party (see Southern strategy and silent majority).

== History ==
Representative Howard W. Smith of Virginia took up the boll weevil as a symbol in the 1950s, during Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s administration, but the term did not gain currency until the 1980s, when it was revived by Representative Charles W. Stenholm of Texas. The group adopted the name of the boll weevil, a pest destructive to cotton crops, because of the difficulty of eradicating the weevil and the pest&#x27;s range in the Southern United States.

Nonetheless, a bloc of conservative Democrats, mostly Southerners, remained in the United States Congress throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These included Democratic House members as conservative as Georgia&#x27;s Larry McDonald, who was also a leader in the John Birch Society.

During the administration of Ronald Reagan, the term &quot;boll weevils&quot; was applied to this bloc of conservative Democrats, who consistently voted for Reagan administration policies, such as tax cuts, increases in military spending, and deregulation. The boll weevils were contrasted with the &quot;gypsy moth Republicans&quot;—moderate Republicans from the Northeast and Midwest who opposed many of Reagan&#x27;s economic policies.

Most of the Democratic boll weevils eventually retired from politics, or in the case of some, such as Senators Phil Gramm of Texas and Richard Shelby of Alabama, switched parties and joined the Republicans. Since 1988, the term &quot;boll weevils&quot; has fallen out of favor.

A bloc of conservative Democrats in the House, including some younger or newer members as well as the remaining boll weevils who refused to bow to pressure to switch parties, organized themselves as the &quot;Blue Dogs&quot; in the early 1990s. A different bloc of Democrats also emerged in the 1990s, under the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), espousing pro-business views on economic issues and moderate views on social issues.

<text>The rodent family Platacanthomyidae, or Oriental dormice, includes the spiny dormice and the Chinese pygmy dormice. In spite of their appearance, these animals are not true dormice, but are part of the large and complex superfamily Muroidea. The platacanthomyids can be distinguished from the true dormice, because they have no premolars, giving them three cheek teeth, like their relatives, the Muroidea.

The evolutionary relationship of the Platacanthomyidae was uncertain until a molecular phylogenetic study found it to be the earliest extant lineage to branch within the superfamily Muroidea. They can be distinguished from both the family Spalacidae and the Eumuroida (all non-spalacid and non-platacanthomyid muroids), by the distinct shape of their infraorbital canal and by the presence of multiple openings in the palate of the skull. On the basis of these two characteristics, they have been considered to be distinct from all other muroids. More work is needed to determine the evolutionary position of this subfamily.

The Platacanthomyidae contain three genera – &quot;Neocometes&quot;, &quot;Platacanthomys&quot; (spiny dormice), and &quot;Typhlomys&quot; (pygmy dormice) – but only three extant species.

<text>Foghat are an English rock band formed in London in 1971. The band is known for the use of electric slide guitar in its music. Their best known song is the 1975 hit &quot;Slow Ride&quot;. The band has released 17 studio albums, including eight gold albums and one platinum; along with one double platinum live album. Despite several line-up changes, the band continues to record and perform.

==History==
===1970s===
The band initially featured Dave Peverett (&quot;Lonesome Dave&quot;) on guitar and vocals, Tony Stevens on bass and Roger Earl on drums, after all three musicians left Savoy Brown in 1971. Rod Price, on guitar/slide guitar, joined after he left Black Cat Bones in December 1970. The new line-up was named &quot;Foghat&quot; (a nonsense word from a Scrabble-like game played by Peverett and his brother) in January 1971. There is a cartoon drawing on the back cover of the group&#x27;s first album of a head wearing a foghat.

Foghat relocated to the United States after signing a deal with Bearsville Records. Its debut album, &quot;Foghat&quot; (1972), was produced by Dave Edmunds and featured a cover of Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You&quot;, which received considerable airplay, especially on FM stations. The album also included a remake of Savoy Brown&#x27;s bluesy ode to the road &quot;Leavin&#x27; Again (Again!)&quot;, and &quot;Sarah Lee&quot;, a classic blues burner featuring Price&#x27;s slide guitar solo. The band&#x27;s second self-titled album went gold. It was also known as &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; for its cover photo of a rock and a bread roll. &quot;Energized&quot; (1974) came out, followed by &quot;Rock and Roll Outlaws&quot; (1974) and &quot;Fool for the City&quot; (1975). In 1974, Stevens left the band due to its relentless touring schedule and was temporarily replaced by producer Nick Jameson for the recording of &quot;Fool for the City&quot;. During the next year, Jameson was replaced by Craig MacGregor, and the group released &quot;Night Shift&quot; (1976), a live album (1977) and &quot;Stone Blue&quot; (1978), each attaining gold status in record sales. &quot;Fool for the City&quot; spawned the hit single &quot;Slow Ride&quot; (which reached No. 20 in the United States and No. 14 in Canada), but the greatest sales figures were reached by &quot;Foghat Live&quot;, which went double platinum. More hits followed: &quot;Drivin&#x27; Wheel&quot;, &quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You&quot; (from the live album), &quot;Stone Blue&quot; and &quot;Third Time Lucky (First Time I Was a Fool)&quot;. Price left the band in November 1980, unhappy with the group&#x27;s still constant touring and the shift away from the hard boogie sound toward a more new wave-influenced pop direction. By February 1981, after months of auditions, he was replaced by Erik Cartwright.

===1980s===
After 1978, Foghat&#x27;s record sales began to slip, and its last album for the Bearsville label, &quot;Zig-Zag Walk&quot; (1983), only briefly touched the charts at number 192. MacGregor quit in 1982, and Jameson returned to play on &quot;In the Mood for Something Rude&quot; and &quot;Zig Zag Walk&quot; before being replaced by Kenny Aaronson (1983) and then Rob Alter (1983-1984). MacGregor returned in 1984.

The band briefly disbanded in 1984 after Peverett left and returned to England. Earl, along with MacGregor and Cartwright, reformed with a new singer/guitarist, Eric (E.J.) Burgeson, and continued touring as Foghat into the early 1990s. MacGregor (1986-1987, 1991), Cartwright&#x27;s brother Brett Cartwright (1987, 1988–1989) and Jeff Howell (1987-1988, 1989–1991) alternated on bass during that period, while Phil Nudelman (1989-1990) and Billy Davis (1990-1993) took over for Burgeson. Dave Crigger joined on bass in 1991–1993.

===1990s===
Peverett had returned to the United States by 1990 and formed his own version of the band, Lonesome Dave&#x27;s Foghat, which featured Bryan Bassett (ex-Wild Cherry), Stephen Dees (bass) and Eddie Zyne (drums). Dees and Zyne had played with Hall &amp; Oates, among others. Former Molly Hatchet bassist Riff West replaced Dees in 1991, and Price made several guest appearances.

In 1993, the original line-up reunited at the urging of producer Rick Rubin. Although Rubin ultimately proved to be unavailable to produce their comeback project, the group went ahead and released a studio album titled &quot;Return of the Boogie Men&quot; (1994) and the &quot;Road Cases&quot; live album (1998). Its final album of the decade, &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot; (taken from the syndicated radio show of the same name), was released in May 1999 and consisted of live recordings from 1974 and 1976.

After being back together for six years, the original line-up once again ended after Price decided to retire from touring for good. Bassett (who had been playing with Molly Hatchet), from Lonesome Dave&#x27;s Foghat, was brought in on guitar.

===2000s===

The 2000s saw the deaths of founding members Peverett and Price. Peverett died on 7 February 2000, aged 56, from complications from kidney cancer.

Charlie Huhn (formerly of Humble Pie, Ted Nugent, and Victory) was brought in to replace him on lead vocals and guitar. This line-up of Earl, Stevens, Bassett, Huhn and Steve &quot;ih&quot; Farrell on backing vocals and hand percussion recorded the album &quot;Family Joules&quot; (2003).

Price died on 22 March 2005, aged 57, due to a fall resulting from a heart attack. Later that year, original bassist Stevens left the band and was replaced by former bassist MacGregor.

===2010s===
The 2010 version of Foghat consisted of Earl, MacGregor, Huhn and Bassett. Former Rainbow and Black Sabbath drummer Bobby Rondinelli had temporarily replaced Earl for a summer 2010 concert, while Earl was recovering from surgery. At another Foghat concert that summer, after Earl had returned to the band, bassist Jeff Howell temporarily replaced an ill MacGregor. Foghat&#x27;s next album, &quot;Last Train Home&quot; (released 15 June 2010), was the culmination of a dream shared by Earl and Peverett. It contained some of their favorite blues songs, three originals (&quot;Born for the Road&quot;, &quot;Last Train Home&quot; and &quot;495 Boogie&quot;), and two songs by special guest performer and longtime friend Eddie Kirkland, who was 86 years old at the time. He had played with Foghat as a guest in 1977 at Foghat&#x27;s &quot;Tribute to the Blues&quot; show at New York City&#x27;s Palladium, and remained a good friend of the band until he was killed in a car accident on 27 February 2011.

Also performing on &quot;Last Train Home&quot; were Howell (bass), Colin Earl (piano) and Lefty Lefkowitz (harmonica). According to Earl, the album was &quot;a testimony to Lonesome Dave. We always planned to do this. I am so fortunate to have partners in band members Charlie Huhn and Bryan Bassett who share the same passion for the blues. It was not hard work putting this album together; playing this kind of music is joyous. We had a blast!&quot;

The band released a DVD in December 2013 called &quot;Live in St. Pete&quot;.

On 10 November 2015, Foghat announced that they would start work on a new studio album, completely fan-funded through PledgeMusic. The album, titled &quot;Under the Influence&quot;, was released on 24 June 2016. The album went on to chart of Billboard and debuted at No. 17 on Billboard&#x27;s Hard Rock Albums, and peaked at No. 40 on the Independent Album charts.

The band went on to release another live album, &quot;Live at the Belly Up&quot; in June 2017. On 9 July 2017, Erik Cartwright, who played lead guitar from 1981 to 1984, died at his home in Nashville, Tennessee, from a heart attack. He was 66 years old.

Longtime bassist MacGregor was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer in 2015. The cancer was first detected at an earlier stage in 2012, but MacGregor was not informed until 2015. Following this incident, he became a proponent of a bill that would require physicians to communicate test results with patients promptly. Although still officially a member of Foghat, the effects of chemotherapy made him unable to play music. Former Pat Travers bassist Rodney O&#x27;Quinn filled in for him on tours. MacGregor died on 9 February 2018.

Matt Barranti substituted on guitar for Bryan Bassett for a gig at Palace Theater in Greensburg, Pennsylvania on 11 February 2017.

===2020s===

The lineup of Earl, Bassett, Huhn and O&#x27;Quinn would go on to record a live record in November 2019 called &quot;8 Days on the Road&quot;. The album was released in July 2021.

In January 2022, lead singer Charlie Huhn retired. Scott Holt, formerly a guitarist for Buddy Guy, became the new lead singer and guitarist. Holt had previously lent his vocals for &quot;Under the Influence&quot; and was lead vocalist in Foghat side project Earl &amp; the Agitators.

In August 2023, Foghat announced plans to release their 17th studio album, &quot;Sonic Mojo&quot;, with first single being &quot;Drivin’ On,&quot; co-written by Kim Simmonds from Savoy Brown in November 2023. It was released on 10 November, a year after the ailing Simmonds&#x27; death from colon cancer.

<doc id="1257143" wikidata="Q1053849" url="?curid=1257143" title="Virelai">
<text>A virelai is a form of medieval French verse used often in poetry and music. It is one of the three &quot;formes fixes&quot; (the others were the ballade and the rondeau) and was one of the most common verse forms set to music in Europe from the late thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries.

One of the most famous composers of virelai is Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300–1377), who also wrote his own verse; 33 separate compositions in the form survive by him. Other composers of virelai include Jehannot de l&#x27;Escurel, one of the earliest (d. 1304), and Guillaume Dufay (c. 1400–1474), one of the latest. 

By the mid-15th century, the form had become largely divorced from music, and numerous examples of this form (including the ballade and the rondeau) were written, which were either not intended to be set to music, or for which the music has not survived.

A virelai with only a single stanza is also known as a bergerette.

== Musical virelai ==

The virelai as a song form of the 14th and early 15th century usually has three stanzas, and a refrain that is stated before the first stanza and again after each. Within each stanza, the structure is that of the bar form, with two sections that share the same rhymes and music (&quot;Stollen&quot;), followed by a third (&quot;Abgesang&quot;). The third section of each stanza shares its rhymes and music with the refrain. Thus, it can be schematically represented as AbbaA, where &quot;A&quot; represents the repeated refrain, &quot;a&quot; represents the verse set to the same music as the refrain, and &quot;b&quot; represents the remaining verses set to different music.

Within this overall structure, the number of lines and the rhyme scheme is variable. The refrain and &quot;Abgesang&quot; may be of three, four or five lines each, with rhyme schemes such as ABA, ABAB, AAAB, ABBA, or AABBA. The structure often involves an alternation of longer with shorter lines. Typically, all three stanzas share the same set of rhymes, which means that the entire poem may be built on just two rhymes, if the &quot;Stollen&quot; sections also share their rhymes with the refrain.

&quot;Douce Dame Jolie&quot; by Guillaume de Machaut is an example of a virelai with rhymes AAAB in the refrain, and AAB (with a shortened second verse) in each of the &quot;stollen&quot; sections.

== Virelai &quot;ancien&quot; and &quot;nouveau&quot; ==

From the 15th century onwards the virelai was no longer regularly set to music but became a purely literary form, and its structural variety proliferated. The 17th-century prosodist Père Mourgues defined what he called the &quot;virelai ancien&quot; in a way that has little in common with the musical virelais of the 14th and 15th centuries. His &quot;virelai ancien&quot; is a structure without a refrain and with an interlocking rhyme scheme between the stanzas: in the first stanza, the rhymes are AAB AAB AAB, with the B lines shorter than the A lines. In the second stanza, the B rhymes are shifted to the longer verses, and a new C rhyme is introduced for the shorter ones (BBC BBC BBC), and so on. Another form described by Père Mourgues is the &quot;virelai nouveau&quot;, which has a two-line refrain at the beginning, with each stanza ending with a repetition of either the first or the second refrain verse in alternation, and the last stanza ending in both refrain verses in reversed order. These forms have occasionally been reproduced in later English poetry, e.g. by John Payne (&quot;Spring Sadness&quot;, a &quot;virelai ancien&quot;), and Henry Austin Dobson (&quot;July&quot;, a &quot;virelai nouveau&quot;).

<text>Gaius Valgius Rufus was a Roman senator, and a contemporary of Horace and Maecenas. He succeeded Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus as suffect consul upon the latter&#x27;s death in 12 BC. Rufus is best known as a writer of elegies and epigrams, and his contemporaries believed him capable of great things in epic writing. The author of the panegyric on Messalla Corvinus compared Rufus as the equal of Homer.

Rufus did not confine himself to poetry. He discussed grammatical questions by correspondence, translated the rhetorical manual of his teacher Apollodorus of Pergamon, and began a treatise on medicinal plants, dedicated to Augustus. Horace addressed to him the ninth ode of the second book of his poems.

<doc id="1257146" wikidata="Q4768" url="?curid=1257146" title="Karl Bryullov">
<text>Karl Pavlovich Bryullov, also Briullov or Briuloff, born Charles Bruleau (; – ) was a Russian painter and draftsman, the most famous representative of the Bryullov artistic dynasty, one of the main artists of late Russian classicism of the first half of the 19th century; the author of monumental historical canvases, also successfully worked as a portrait painter and genre painter. Honorary free member (since 1834) and professor (1836–1849) of the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, collegiate councilor (1846). Member of the Academy of San Luca in Rome, the Brera Academy in Milan and the Academy of Fine Arts in Parma; Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence. He is regarded as a key figure in transition from the Russian neoclassicism to romanticism.

== Biography ==
Karl Bryullov was born on 12 (23) December 1799 in St. Petersburg, in the family of the academician, woodcarver, and engraver Pavel Ivanovich Briullo (Brulleau, 1760—1833) who was of Huguenot descent. He felt drawn to Italy from his early years. Despite his education at the Imperial Academy of Arts (1809–1821), Bryullov never fully embraced the classical style taught by his mentors and promoted by his brother, Alexander Bryullov. After distinguishing himself as a promising and imaginative student and finishing his education, he left Russia for Rome where he worked until 1835 as a portraitist and genre painter, though his fame as an artist came when he began doing historical painting.

His best-known work, &quot;The Last Day of Pompeii&quot; (1830–1833), is a vast composition compared by Pushkin and Gogol to the best works of Rubens and Van Dyck. It created a sensation in Italy and established Bryullov as one of the finest European painters of his day. After completing this work, he triumphantly returned to the Russian capital, where he made many friends among the aristocracy and intellectual elite and obtained a high post in the Imperial Academy of Arts.

An anecdote concerning Bryullov appeared in Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s essay &quot;&quot; and later in the same author&#x27;s book &quot;What Is Art?&quot;.

While teaching at the academy (1836–1848) he developed a portrait style which combined a neoclassical simplicity with a romantic tendency that fused well, and his penchant for realism was satisfied with an intriguing level of psychological penetration. While he was working on the plafond of St Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral, his health suddenly deteriorated. Following advice of his doctors, Bryullov left Russia for Madeira in 1849 and spent the last three years of his life in Italy. He died in the village of Manziana near Rome and is buried at the Cimitero Acattolico there.

== Characteristics of art ==
Bryullov&#x27;s work is the pinnacle of late Russian Romanticism when the sense of harmonic wholeness and beauty of the world is replaced by a feeling of tragedy and conflict of life. In the forefront of the historical picture, but its main theme - not the struggle of heroes, as in classicism, and the fate of the huge human masses. In his central work &quot;The Last Day of Pompeii&quot; Bryullov combined the drama of action, romantic lighting effects and sculptural plasticity of figures. The painting brought the artist great fame both in Russia and in Europe.

An outstanding master of both ceremonial and chamber portraits, Bryullov evolved in his art from the joyful embrace of life in his early works to the intricate psychologism of his later ones, thus anticipating the achievements of such artists like Ilya Repin in the second half of the 19th century. Bryullov had an enormous influence on Russian artists, among whom he had many followers and imitators.

<doc id="1257147" wikidata="Q784886" url="?curid=1257147" title="The American Language">
<text>The American Language; An Inquiry into the Development of English in the United States, first published in 1919, is a book written by H. L. Mencken about the English language as spoken in the United States.

==Origins and concept==
Mencken was inspired by &quot;the argot of the colored waiters&quot; in Washington, as well as one of his favorite authors, Mark Twain, and his experiences on the streets of Baltimore. In 1902, Mencken remarked on the &quot;queer words which go into the making of &#x27;United States.&#x27;&quot; The book was preceded by several columns in &quot;The Evening Sun.&quot; Mencken eventually asked &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t some painstaking pundit attempt a grammar of the American language... English, that is, as spoken by the great masses of the plain people of this fair land?&quot;

In the tradition of Noah Webster, who wrote the first American dictionary, Mencken wanted to defend &quot;Americanisms&quot; against a steady stream of English critics, who usually isolated Americanisms as borderline &quot;perversions&quot; of the &quot;mother tongue&quot;. Mencken assaulted the prescriptive grammar of these critics and American &quot;schoolmarms&quot;, arguing, like Samuel Johnson in the preface to his dictionary, that language evolves independently of textbooks.

The book discusses the beginnings of &quot;American&quot; variations from &quot;English&quot;, the spread of these variations, American names and slang over the course of its 374 pages. According to Mencken, American English was more colourful, vivid, and creative than its British counterpart.

The book sold exceptionally well for a reference book — 1500 books, the entire first printing, in less than 2 years. The book was an early title published by Alfred A. Knopf and was revised three times in the author&#x27;s lifetime. Reviews of the book praised it lavishly, with the exception of one by Mencken&#x27;s old nemeses, Stuart Sherman.

Many of the sources and research material associated with the book are in the Mencken collection at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, Maryland.

==Editions==
The first edition of 1919 was revised in 1921 and 1923; the fourth &quot;corrected, revised, and enlarged&quot; edition was published in 1936. Mencken released two full-sized &quot;Supplements&quot; to the main volume, in 1945 and 1948, based on the boom in linguistics articles. An abridged single-volume compilation of the original volume and supplements was edited by Raven I. McDavid Jr. and published in 1963.

<doc id="1257155" wikidata="Q2642279" url="?curid=1257155" title="Jughandle">
<text>A jughandle is a type of ramp or slip road that changes the way traffic turns left at an at-grade intersection (in a country where traffic drives on the right). Instead of a standard left turn being made from the left lane, left-turning traffic uses a ramp on the right side of the road. In a standard &quot;forward jughandle&quot; or &quot;near-side jughandle&quot;, the ramp leaves before the intersection, and left-turning traffic turns left off of it rather than the through road; right turns are also made using the jughandle. In a &quot;reverse jughandle&quot; or &quot;far-side jughandle&quot;, the ramp leaves after the intersection, and left-turning traffic loops around to the right and merges with the crossroad before the intersection. 

The jughandle is also known as a Jersey left due to its high prevalence within the U.S. state of New Jersey (though this term is also locally used for an illegal abrupt left at the beginning of a green light cycle). The New Jersey Department of Transportation defines three types of jughandles. &quot;Type A&quot; is the standard forward jughandle. &quot;Type B&quot; is a variant with no cross-street intersected by the jughandle; it curves 90 degrees left to meet the main street, and is either used at a &quot;T&quot; intersection or for a U-turn only. &quot;Type C&quot; is the standard reverse jughandle.

==History==
A 1956 article in the &quot;Asbury Park Press&quot; cited a suggestion by the state&#x27;s top highway planner to add a &quot;jug-handle&quot; on Route 35 to facilitate the flow of traffic. One of the earliest mentions of jughandles in &quot;The New York Times&quot; is on June 14, 1959, referring to jughandles having been built in New Jersey on U.S. Route 46 in Montville, U.S. Route 22 between North Plainfield and Bound Brook, and Route 35 at Monmouth Park Racetrack, with the article citing the addition of &quot;jug-handle exits&quot; as a way to reduce accidents. By the beginning of 1960, New Jersey had 160 jughandles, most if not all standard before-intersection jughandles. The 160th one was on U.S. Route 1 between New Brunswick and Trenton. Jughandles had been introduced in the 1940s as a way to keep turning vehicles away from the flow of traffic on main roads, but by 2013 a bill to ban the jughandle had made it to the floor of the New Jersey Senate.

While jughandles are largely associated with New Jersey, the states of Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Ohio, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Vermont also use jughandles at several intersections. Jughandles are possible in other locations as they are a valid type of intersection control to consider for intersection design.

==Signage==

On New Jersey State Highways and Pennsylvania State Highways, a white sign is placed before a jughandle or at the beginning of a stretch of jughandles saying &quot;All turns from right lane&quot;, or a similar message. Each jughandle is marked with a white sign below the standard green sign, saying &quot;All turns&quot;, or &quot;U and left turns&quot; in the case of a reverse jughandle.

On locally maintained roads, and in other states, jughandle signage can appear to be haphazard and confusing to out of state drivers.

==Advantages==
* Safety
** Removes left-turning vehicles from travel lanes, particularly from higher-speed left lanes.
** Pedestrian crossing distance is reduced across the mainline.
** Reduced left-turn conflict points as compared to a standard four-leg intersection.
** Removes conflicts with right-turning vehicles and pedestrians/bicyclists at the primary intersection.
* Operations
** Reduced average delays, total travel time, and number of stops through the intersection in near saturated traffic conditions.
** Higher intersection capacity for left turning vehicles.
** Provides u-turn opportunity for larger vehicles on roadways with narrow median
** Reduced signal phases due to the elimination of the associated left-turn phase(s).
** Shorter pedestrian crossing distance across the mainline may provide for shorter cross street signal phases.
** Reduced need for rights-of-way acquisition when there is not any room for a left turning lane; focuses land requirement near intersection rather than a long stretch that is often highly developed.

==Disadvantages==
* Safety
** Driver confusion, due to left-turns being made from the right side of the roadway – an uncommon configuration outside of the northeastern United States. Expectancy issues may be compounded due to inconsistency between intersections, where some intersections may be jughandles and others may be standard intersections. These issues can be reduced through advance signing.
** Pedestrian conflict is increased along the cross street due to the addition of an additional intersecting approach.
** Creates a higher-speed conflict between vehicles and pedestrians/bicyclists at the divergence point of the jughandle ramp.
* Operations
** Potential for increased travel time and delay for left-turning motorists redirected through jughandle.
** Potential for queues along the cross street to block the exit terminal of the jughandle, increasing stops, delays, and travel time of left-turning motorists.
** Increased overall percentage of vehicles stopped at the intersection.
** With reverse jughandles, motorists travel through the intersection twice: adding to the net movement demand.
** Motorists wishing to perform a U-turn maneuver at a reverse jughandle must perform a weaving maneuver across all cross-street lanes to travel from the jughandle terminus to the left-turn lane (unless another reverse jughandle is located on the other corner on the side of the cross street ahead of the motorist&#x27;s original direction, in which case the motorist stays on the right but must cross through the intersection three times).
** To provide for motorist safety, the Federal Highway Administration recommends locating transit stops further from the intersection, outside of the jughandle ramps. This can reduce pedestrian demand due to the additional travel distance to access the transit stop.
**&quot;Type A&quot; standard forward jughandles can encourage drivers to try beating (bypassing) the stopped redlight traffic by driving into the jughandle, turning left, and then turning right onto the original roadway to proceed in the original direction of travel prior to that roadway&#x27;s light turning green again and releasing the stopped traffic.
* Right-of-way
** Additional right-of-way may be required alongside the roadway, unless the existing street network can be utilized.

<doc id="1257162" wikidata="Q852033" url="?curid=1257162" title="Perth Glory FC">
<text>Perth Glory Football Club is an Australian professional soccer club based in Perth, Western Australia. It competes in the country&#x27;s premier men&#x27;s competition, A-League Men, under licence from Australian Professional Leagues.

Founded in 1995, Perth Glory is one of three A-League clubs to survive from the now-defunct National Soccer League (NSL), playing their debut match in this competition in October 1996 for the 1996–97 season. Perth established itself as a major side within Australian soccer in the final seasons of this league, with managers Bernd Stange and Mich d&#x27;Avray leading the club to three league Premierships and two Championships from four grand final appearances within a five-season period. Since entering the A-League as one of the eight original teams in 2004, the club has won a further Premiership and appeared in two more grand finals under the management of Tony Popovic and Ian Ferguson. The club has also appeared in the AFC Champions League once and appeared in two Australia Cup finals and two A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup finals.

The club plays its home matches at Perth Rectangular Stadium, currently known as &quot;HBF Park&quot; for sponsorship purposes, a 20,500-seat stadium on Lord Street in Perth&#x27;s city centre. Perth has used this stadium as their home ground since their inception.

Perth&#x27;s main supporters&#x27; group is known as the &quot;Glory Shed Supporters Club&quot;, named after &quot;The Shed&quot;, a terrace at the club&#x27;s home ground. The club has rivalries with Wellington Phoenix, Gold Coast United, and the Melbourne Knights. The club&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer is Bobby Despotovski, with 129 goals to his name in all competitions. Jamie Harnwell holds the record for most matches played, with 256 appearances for the Glory.

==History==
===Background (1977–95)===
Perth first showed interest in joining the National Soccer League (NSL) prior to its inaugural year in 1977, but a series of logistical and financial problems meant that the league was reluctant to include a Western Australian team. While the state representative side continued to perform well in national and international cup competitions, WA continued to be unrepresented in a national club league until 1994, when a group of businessmen led by Joe Claudio formed the Perth Kangaroos IFC.

The club competed in the 1994 Singapore Premier League along with the Darwin Cubs: at the time, there were visions of establishing an Asia-Pacific Super League which could become a sporting and financial empire in the east. The Kangaroos finished the league season undefeated, and easily won the Singapore league title. However, with dwindling support and resources, the experiment proved to be a financial disaster, and Perth Kangaroos IFC soon folded.
===Early seasons (1995–98)===
In 1995, another consortium led by Nick Tana made a bid for entry into the National Soccer League. Perth Glory was subsequently licensed to join the 1996–97 NSL season and on 1 December 1995 the club was officially launched. From a relatively unheralded start, the club would develop beyond all expectations and help commercially re-establish soccer in the mainstream sports consciousness in a State where the AFL competition playing Australian Rules Football is given media dominance. Former Australian Socceroo international, Adelaide City and Perth Kangaroos coach Gary Marocchi was appointed coach for the first two seasons and won many fans with his bold, attacking style. Perth only just missed the cut for the finals; finishing 7th and 8th in 1996–97 and 1997–98 respectively.

In the Glory&#x27;s inaugural season, players such as NSL-title-winning sweeper Vinko Buljubašić, Perth-based striker Bobby Despotovski and young local star Vas Kalogeracos were brought into the team and achieved cult status. New Zealand international Gavin Wilkinson was also signed while local midfielder Gareth Naven was appointed captain. In their first match in the NSL, Perth Glory lost to Sydney Olympic 4–1, with veteran Scot Alan MacKenzie scoring the first goal for Glory and Doug Ithier winning the first Man-of-the-Match award. Large crowds and good results soon followed with an exciting win over defending champions, the Melbourne Knights, thrilling a huge crowd. Glory needed only a point in their final match of the season but were defeated by the Knights and fell just short of making the finals. Glory midfielder Paul Strudwick was sent off during the match in controversial circumstances while trouble in the crowd also marred the match.

In the 1997–98 season, despite again narrowly missing the top six and signing more high-profile players like Ernie Tapai, Danny Hay and Nigerians Samson Siasia and Peter Anosike, it was a disappointing season for the Glory.

===Stange era (1998–2001)===
Fan support was further consolidated in the era of Bernd Stange. The former East German national coach became a media star after replacing Gary Marocchi who was sacked. Mich d&#x27;Avray, a former England under-21 international was appointed as Stange&#x27;s assistant coach.

In his first season, Stange had taken Glory to their first-ever finals series and had fallen in the preliminary final against Sydney United. With new signings John Markovski and Con Boutsianis fitting straight into the side, local player Jamie Harnwell started to develop into a key defender and made the step to replace the injured Vinko Buljubašić. Unfortunately, a horror form slump at the height of summer denied the Glory a top-two place but massive crowds still attended their two home finals at the WACA Ground against Adelaide City and Marconi Stallions.

In the following season, Glory recruited young players Ivan Ergić, Jason Petković and Olyroo Kasey Wehrman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transfers_1999/2000&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The club finished first in the regular season and were crowned minor premiers for the first time, allowing them to enter the final series at the major semifinal. In the finals series, the Glory lost to Wollongong Wolves 1–0 at Brandon Park, the Wolves&#x27; home ground, in the first leg of the major semifinal. The second leg of the major semifinal was held at Subiaco Oval, rather than their regular venue Perth Oval, to accommodate an expected larger crowd. In the match, Perth Glory won 2–0 over the Wolves, 2–1 on aggregate, to qualify for the grand final. The crowd of 42,764 was an Australian record for a club soccer match. In the wake of the record crowd, the Western Australian government announced a purpose-built stadium for the Glory in central Perth. The 1999–2000 grand final is remembered as one of the most thrilling matches in NSL history. Perth again faced the Wolves and led 3–0 at half time against a miserable Wolves outfit; thinking the game was won, Stange substituted key Glory players Scott Miller, Bobby Despotovski and Ivan Ergić. Yet, the Wolves rallied superbly and Perth experienced a series of defensive blunders to be pegged back to 3–3 at full-time. Perth subsequently lost on penalties, but this defining moment galvanised the team and would be a motivating force for years to come. James Afkos, a young defender and son of Glory co-owner Paul Afkos saw his penalty saved, which gave the win to the Wolves. The Wolves side also featured players such as Scott Chipperfield, Sašo Petrovski as well as Matt Horsley and Stuart Young who would go on to play with the Glory in later years. The loss was a crushing blow to Glory but the team had done well despite problems Stange had with stars such as Vas Kalogeracos and Con Boutsianis who had both left the club. Stange had also been told midway through the season that his contract would not be renewed—but well-organised supporter protest and media pressure forced Tana to change his mind and publicly announce the U-turn before a home match against the Canberra Cosmos.

In spite of the loss, Stange was popular with the public but his time had come by the end of the 2000–01 season. Glory was too inconsistent during the season, suffering from more player disharmony involving Stange&#x27;s tactics, and falling just short of a top-two spot. Glory had at times played good attacking football but proved unable to do so consistently. In the finals series, the Glory once again came up against the Melbourne Knights and drew 0–0 in Melbourne despite having Jamie Harnwell sent off. Following the match Melbourne Knights fans attacked the team and their bus as they tried to leave Sunshine Stadium. It is believed that the fans were angered by a Serbian salute made by Bobby Despotovski towards Melbourne Knights fans, a club who traditionally has a large Croatian support base. In the return leg Glory were eliminated following a 2–2 draw. The Knights had gone into an early lead with goals in slippery conditions before two late goals to the Glory but it wasn&#x27;t enough with the Knights winning through the away goal rule. Despite signing high-profile recruits such as Damian Mori (who had formed a prolific partnership with Bobby Despotovski upfront) and Brad Maloney while also holding onto young star Ljubo Miličević the Glory had underachieved and Stange was sacked by Nick Tana.

===D&#x27;Avray era and end of NSL (2001–04)===
Despite the flair of Stange&#x27;s reign, it would take the more tactical approach of Mich d&#x27;Avray to finally win the NSL Championship. While less flamboyant than his predecessor, d&#x27;Avray successfully transformed the team with a different strategy to the previous coaches. The attacking 5–3–2, which saw almost as many goals conceded as scored, was replaced with a 4–4–2. Some may argue that the team began to play a less attractive form of the game, but nobody could argue with the results. In 2001–2, the team nearly went the entire season undefeated with a side that only had former Adelaide City midfielder Brad Hassell as a major addition. After scraping through in the second leg of the major semi-final against Newcastle, Glory faced Sydney Olympic in the grand final at a sold-out Subiaco Oval. While the 2000 Final was one of the great games of domestic Australian association football, the 2002 final was a tight and tense affair with Glory hardly getting a shot on target due to the fact that they lacked any bite in the midfield and had their two strikers marked out of the game. Ante Milicic was on target for Olympic though and his goal early in the second half was enough for Olympic to win 1–0 and break the hearts of Glory fans once again.

Maloney left the club at the end of the 2002 season but his replacement proved to be a key in Glory finally getting that elusive title. German midfielder Andre Gumprecht was brought into the club thanks to Stange and made an instant impact. With the NSL disintegrating around them, Glory and Olympic were the only two semi-decent teams still left in the league to galvanise their midfield and fought it out for top spot all season. Glory missed out on the league title, finishing one point behind Olympic. In March 2003, the NSL stripped the club of three points after ruling that Gumprecht had been played before he had been registered. Glory picked up Socceroo Simon Colosimo halfway through the season and eventually won the right to host the 2003 Grand Final after coming out on top of a new, confusing and convoluted league table finals format that had dragged a poor season out. In the Grand Final Glory took the game to Olympic and following a headed goal from in the first half from Harnwell it was all over late in the match when Mori saw his shot dribble over the line in dramatic fashion. 2–0 was the result and d&#x27;Avray had delivered the Grand Final victory Glory had yearned for.

In the final NSL season in 2003–04, Glory only had Parramatta Power as a huge threat with the Western Sydney club buying up big for the season. Players like Fernando Rech, Michael Beauchamp and Ante Miličić were brought in along with Glory midfielders Gumprecht and Colosimo in what seemed to be a huge blow to the champions. In response to the plundering of their engine room d&#x27;Avray signed up Sydney Olympic title winners Tom Pondeljak, Wayne Srhoj and Jade North while also getting former Socceroo defender and West Australian Shaun Murphy back from the United Kingdom. In a season where Glory again went head to head with a team from Sydney, Parramatta beat the Glory at home 4–2 and then away 2–0 to host the final ever NSL Grand Final. Glory thrashed Adelaide United in the preliminary final and faced Parramatta at Parramatta Stadium to try and go for back to back victories. In the pouring rain, Parramatta were brought down to the level of their opponents and scrapped for every ball in a match devoid of many chances. Mori wasted two sitters before young striker Nick Mrđa nailed a shot past Clint Bolton to claim the golden goal and win the match for Glory and their second NSL title. It was around 2001 that the league showed signs of significant deterioration. A combination of central mismanagement, conflicts of interest and poor sponsorship would eventually lead to a government inquiry and the removal of the leadership of Soccer Australia. Eventually, the relaunched and renamed Football Federation Australia announced the creation of the A-League in 2005. The financial backing and business nous of chairman Nick Tana had ensured the viability and success of the club during the earlier dire times – and ensured it a place in the future of the game in Australia.

===Decline and ownership troubles (2005–09)===
In January 2005, former Liverpool and England star Steve McMahon was appointed as coach. The club changed its name from the Perth Glory Soccer Club to the Perth Glory Football Club with a new logo being unveiled at a season launch in February. The 2005–06 season saw a complete overhaul of the playing squad, with Simon Colosimo and former Sunderland and Leeds striker Brian Deane as key signings. Other notable signings included future young stars Nick Ward and Billy Celeski. Early results in friendlies against local opposition were not great, but Perth became the first team to defeat Sydney FC, winning 1–0 in the semi-final of the 2005 A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup before losing in the final 0–1 to the Central Coast Mariners. Perth&#x27;s woeful recruiting strategy was soon evident with the early departure of star import Brian Deane after seven games. Another McMahon recruit, Northern Ireland junior international Neil Teggart, quit the club prior to the start of the regular season. Deane was replaced by Damian Mori, a former Perth Glory striker. Originally on a three-game temporary contract, after some impressive performances Mori stayed for the rest of the season and finished with seven goals. However, the club continued to be dogged by problems which would only be later revealed to the public. Steve McMahon was subject to constant media criticism over his coaching style and was accused of nepotism by signing his son, Steve McMahon Jr, who was of questionable talent. Rumours also surfaced that players were planning to stage a revolt against the coach. On 7 December, the club reported that the parties had &quot;amicably&quot; chosen to go separate ways. On 9 December 2005, the club announced that assistant coach Alan Vest would move into the head coach role for the remainder of the season, with striker Damian Mori taking on a dual role as player-coach after being named as his assistant. The coach&#x27;s departure was merely a symptom of deeper troubles. Poor performances saw Perth miss out on qualification for the finals for the first time since 1998. Dwindling support from chairman Nick Tana, as he looked to sell his 75 percent stake in the club, seemed to underpin a general decline in club fortunes. After the Round 20 match against Sydney FC, Alan Vest hinted that the current player group were incapable of achieving anything better and stated that &quot;cliques&quot; had been formed undermining club harmony. To cap off a bad season, Western QBE announced they were withdrawing as major sponsor after being associated with the club for 8 years.

On 1 May 2006, Football Federation Australia relieved owner Nick Tana of ownership and management of Perth Glory. The 2006–07 season saw a host of changes. In July 2006, Australian international Stan Lazaridis signed a two-year deal. This was quickly followed by the appointment of Ron Smith as head coach and Michelle Phillips as CEO on 26 July. Unfortunately, star youth player Nick Ward did not honour his two-year contract and defied the advice of the FFA and left for Queens Park Rangers in England. In a major bonus for the Glory, longtime partner and sponsor Western QBE Insurance gave a show of faith and signed on as the club&#x27;s major sponsor in round 18, until the end of the 2007–2008 season. Western QBE had previously been sponsor of the club since 1998, but decided against resigning a deal at the start of the 2006–2007 season, leaving the Glory in a very tough situation- without any sponsor or owners. But in December 2006, signs were shown that owners had been found by the FFA, and so Western QBE were reinstated. The FFA (holders of the Perth Glory licence) announced on 23 February 2007 that the Glory was to be handed over to a triumvirate of owners: Tony Sage, Brett McKeon and John Spence. This announcement ended almost a year of uncertainty. The new Glory owners were ambitious in their plans, bringing new hope to a club that was somewhat poor, both off the field and on, in 2006–07 season.

The 2007–08 season saw the arrivals of new, promising additions to the side. The Glory signed Anthony Danze, Billy Celeski, Dino Djulbic, AIS graduate Jimmy Downey, Naum Sekulovski, former Perth Soccer Club and Young Socceroos goalkeeper Tando Velaphi, Nikita Rukavytsya, Sydney FC player Nikolai Topor-Stanley, Milton Keynes Dons winger Nick Rizzo, Croatian striker Mate Dragičević, Hayden Foxe, Mitchell Prentice and striker James Robinson. Probably the biggest coup for the Glory for the 2007–08 season was the signing of a one-year sponsorship deal with Singapore listed steel manufacturer Delong Holdings, worth A$750,000, one of the biggest in the A-League, who featured on the back of the Glory jersey. In the 2007 A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup, the Glory surprised many by making it to their second final, despite not playing a single game in Western Australia, which they lost 1–2 against Adelaide United. The new league season started poorly for the Glory, winless after 12 rounds and attracting only four-figure attendances. As a result, Ron Smith came under increasing pressure from fans and the media to deliver results. The team struggled to score goals, with Mate Dragičević in particular becoming a figure of derision. Glory legend Bobby Despotovski publicly called for Smith to be replaced, and on 4 November, Smith was sacked as manager. David Mitchell was handed the caretakers role for the rest of the season. The bold new era of Perth Glory began the same day, when it was announced the Glory were forming a strategic alliance with English Premier League club Manchester City. A 4–1 thrashing of Newcastle in Mitchell&#x27;s debut match bode well for times ahead, with Glory&#x27;s first win at home in a year against Melbourne and Glory&#x27;s first-ever league win over Sydney. Mitchell won four and drew two of the remaining 10 games of the 2007–08 season, with the club finishing 7th overall.

The 2008–09 season preparations began much earlier than past seasons, with Perth Glory going on a three-game tour of China in March, consisting of matches against Changchun Yatai, Guangzhou City and Guangzhou Football Club. Perth Glory also made multiple new signings, including released Eugene Dadi, Adriano Pellegrino, Adrian Trinidad, Josip Magdić, Naum Sekulovski, Brazilian international midfielder Amaral, youngster Scott Bulloch and former Glory midfielder Wayne Srhoj. Perth finished the season in 7th place, with 22 points. Glory once again started the season poor, though they did however finish the second half of the season strongly, winning 4 matches and drawing 3, securing 15 points in the last 11 rounds since November. In November, head coach Dave Mitchell signed a contract extension securing his services till the end of the 2010/11 season. Mitchell&#x27;s contract extension, despite Glory&#x27;s slow start, showed the new direction Glory&#x27;s club was heading, of vision, but built on stable foundations. Promising signs on and off the field were shown this season and things progressed further with Tony Sage taking sole ownership of the club at season&#x27;s end.

===Back to Glory (2009–13)===

Former Perth Glory co-owner Brett McKeon sold his shareholding in the club to Tony Sage in February 2009, making Sage the sole owner of the club. Following this Sage has invested money into the club for the 2009–10 season including a number of wholesale changes to operations, marketing, players and staff. As part of Glory&#x27;s pre-season campaign, the club hosted English Premier League clubs Wolverhampton Wanderers FC and Fulham FC as well as new A-League franchise North Queensland Fury for friendly matches in Perth in July. Although Glory went down 1–0 and 5–0 to Wolverhampton and Fulham respectively the event was a success attracting an average of 13,000 fans to Perth Rectangular Stadium for both matches. Perth Glory continued their pre-season in Mandurah with a 1–0 victory against North Queensland Fury featuring Fury&#x27;s marquee signing Robbie Fowler. For season 2009–10, Perth Glory had undertaken an overhaul of the club badge and playing kit, which includes vertical white and purple stripes on their home kit for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. Tony Sage&#x27;s promise to invest in the club by spending the full amount of money on players allocated under the A-League&#x27;s salary cap rule had eventuated with the club making key signings. Victor Sikora was signed in February 2009 following a short term stint at Glory on loan from FC Dallas during the latter part of the 2008–09 A-League season. Further international players were added to the squad with Serbian striker Branko Jelić signed on a 3-year deal from Energie Cottbus and Englishman Andy Todd joining from Derby County. Following up on an early season promise by Tony Sage to sign Socceroo players, Perth Glory had successfully secured the services of Jacob Burns. In June 2009, in a bold move to attract attention for 2010 FIFA World Cup selection, Mile Sterjovski joined the club on a marquee contract, while Chris Coyne also announced his intentions by returning to his hometown club. Perth Glory&#x27;s first match of the 2009–10 A-League season was played away at Hindmarsh Stadium against Adelaide United on 7 August 2009. This was the first season that Perth made the finals series in the A-League, finishing 5th on the ladder. The Glory were knocked out in the elimination final against Wellington Phoenix on penalties.
At the beginning of the 2010–11 season, Perth signed ex-North Queensland Fury manager Ian Ferguson as the assistant coach, despite rumours circulating that Ferguson and new Glory signing Robbie Fowler had a bad working relationship whilst at North Queensland Fury. Glory signed veteran Jamie Harnwell to a new one-year deal for the 2010–11 season. The club also went on to sign Perth products Jamie Coyne and Todd Howarth to contract extensions, before signing left-back Josh Mitchell and striker Michael Baird, who had played together for Romanian club Universitatea Craiova. On 27 April 2010, it was announced that Fowler had agreed to become part of Glory&#x27;s squad for the 2010–11 A-League season. Fowler reportedly rejected offers from Middle East clubs to stay in Australia after enjoying his time in the country. After an initial strong start to the season as equal-top after a 5-game undefeated streak, Glory lost four matches in a row, forcing David Mitchell to step down as coach, with assistant coach Ian Ferguson becoming his replacement on 12 October 2010. After the managerial change, Glory lost another 3 games, to make it 7 losses consecutively. Glory finished second last in the season, after losing their last 5 games.
Perth Glory&#x27;s 2011–12 season featured several high-profile signings with Ian Ferguson signing a large number of overseas and local players, including former Adelaide United player Travis Dodd, former Gold Coast United players Bas van den Brink and Shane Smeltz, Brazilian player Andrezinho, Irish international Liam Miller and former Ireland Under 21s player Billy Mehmet. Several players were let go, including Robbie Fowler and Jamie Coyne. In the pre-season, Perth played Scottish giants Celtic FC in front of 15,000 fans, with the Glory losing the friendly 0–2. Perth Glory&#x27;s first match of the season was against Adelaide United at nib Stadium, which they won 1–0. They later went on to defeat Wellington Phoenix 1–0, to make it three wins in a row. Glory again slumped in form, winning one out of their last 9 matches including 7 defeats. With pressure mounting on coach Ian Ferguson, on 19 December 2011, Glory Owner Tony Sage threatened to leave the club at the end of the season. However, after apologising and dismissing his threats as an emotional outburst, Glory went out to win 9 of their last 15 and finished third on the ladder, qualifying for the finals series for the second time in their A-League history. Glory&#x27;s finals series kicked off with a 3–0 victory over Melbourne Heart in a match at nib stadium. The semifinal was against their rivals Wellington at nib stadium, which the Glory won 3–2 in extra time. Perth then went to Bluetongue Stadium to play Central Coast Mariners in the preliminary final, the match the Glory won 1–1 (5–3, on penalties) to qualify for their first A-League Grand Final. Against the Brisbane Roar, in front of 50,334 people at Suncorp Stadium, Perth went up 1–0 in the 53rd minute of the match. However, Brisbane&#x27;s Besart Berisha equalised in the 84th minute and eventually scored the winner in the dying seconds of the game through a controversial penalty. Jacob Burns was awarded the Joe Marston Medal for player of the match after it was accidentally awarded to Brisbane player, Thomas Broich.

For the 2012–13 season the Perth Glory owner, Tony Sage, put several players on reduced deals in order to save money. However, some players, such as Andrezinho and Scott Neville, did not accept the offers. Perth Glory also embarked on signing youth, players Chris Harold and Adrian Zahra were signed, while Brandon O&#x27;Neill and Ndumba Makeche were promoted from the youth squad. Perth Glory also won the Grand Final re-match, One goal to Nil, in Round One of the season to hand &quot;revenge&quot; to the Rado Vidošić led Brisbane Roar. A string of poor performance throughout the season saw Ian Ferguson sacked and replaced by former Perth Glory player, Alistair Edwards. The club would then produce a string of good performances to make the finals before being eliminated at the hands of Melbourne Victory, losing 1–2.

At the beginning of the 2013–14 season, the club decided to dedicate the number 12 shirt to the fans by not registering it to a player and having it listed as &#x27;Glory Fans&#x27; when the squad is announced on match days. Alistair Edwards was sacked as Manager on 17 December 2013, and replaced on an interim basis by Kenny Lowe. Many fans blamed Jacob Burns for the sacking of Alistair Edwards (with rumours of him being the leader of the uprising against Edwards). The club would finish 8th in another disappointing season, with at one stage, the club was sitting at the bottom of the table.

===Lowe era (2013–18)===

The 2014–15 season showed much signs of promise. Irish international Andy Keogh, Dutch international Youssouf Hersi and returning goalkeeper Danny Vukovic joined the squad in what would be Kenny Lowe&#x27;s first full season as coach. Glory started the season on a high, quickly becoming league leaders and managing a run in the inaugural 2014 FFA Cup that reached the final. Although they lost the cup final 1–0 to Adelaide United, it did not diminish their efforts in the league. However, the season quickly turned sour when Fairfax Media reported Glory had gone over the salary cap. Football Federation Australia investigated the claims before finding that the club had breached the salary cap by $400,000. As a result of the salary cap violations the club received a $269,000 fine and was disqualified from the 2015 finals series (resulting compulsory 7th-place finish despite ending the season in third place). On 16 April 2015, Perth&#x27;s chief executive Jason Brewer announced his resignation. He was replaced by Peter Filopoulos.

The 2015–16 season was mostly a success, with the newly signed Diego Castro winning the Johnny Warren Medal for the A-League best player. The club finished 5th, before losing 2–0 to the 3rd place Melbourne City FC away from home. In the FFA Cup the Glory again made the final, before going down 2–0 to Melbourne Victory FC.

The 2016–17 season started well with the signings of defender Rhys Williams from English club Middlesbrough and promising 19-year-old midfielder Brandon Wilson, as well as the resigning of reigning Johnny Warren Medalist Diego Castro. After an inconsistent season the club finished 5th, with Castro sharing the club Golden Boot with Andy Keogh and Adam Taggart. They again faced Melbourne City in the elimination final, with the club shock winners 2–0 away from home to set up a semi-final with the newly crowned A-League Premiers Sydney FC. Sydney took a 3–0 halftime lead which they never relinquished, the Glory falling one game short of their second A-League Grand Final.

The 2017–18 season got off to a very bad start, the club losing 1–0 in the first round of the FFA Cup to NPL Victoria club Heidelberg United, despite twin Spanish signings of Andreu Guerao and Xavi Torres, as well as Mitch Nichols and Scott Neville. After slumping to a 6–0 defeat mid-season at the hands of Sydney FC the Glory, and with mounting pressure on coach Kenny Lowe after entering into a battle for bottom spot on the ladder, the Glory signed Neil Kilkenny from Melbourne City whose arrival provided much needed strength in the midfield and coincided with a positive turnaround in form. After defeating eventual Grand Finalists Melbourne Victory FC and Newcastle Jets FC in the closing rounds, the Glory entered the final round with a win against the Brisbane Roar at home netting them the last spot in the finals. The Glory went down 2–3, slumping to 8th position on the ladder. Following a mostly unsuccessful season coach Kenny Lowe was removed as coach and CEO Peter Filopoulos resigned to move back to Victoria to take up the CEO role with Football Federation Victoria, but not before (alongside Head of Football, Jacob Burns) overseeing the appointment of new head coach, Tony Popovic. During Peter&#x27;s time as CEO, membership grew by 50%, the club moved into a new training and administration HQ sharing with Western Force and the club business operations improved significantly. Kenny Lowe took up a role as technical director of the club&#x27;s junior academy. In May 2018, Tony Pignata replaced Peter Filopoulos as CEO of the club. In November, it was confirmed that former player Steven McGarry will become the Technical Director within Glory&#x27;s youth structure, at the same time leading the Under-18 team. Former player Richard Garcia was also confirmed as assistant coach of both the senior team and head coach of the youth team.

===Popovic era and the return of success (2018–20)===
The 2018–19 season and the start of the Tony Popovic era at the club showed many signs of promise. New players were brought into the squad including three-time A-League champion Ivan Franjic, former Socceroo Tomislav Mrcela, Western Sydney&#x27;s all-time top goal scorer Brendon Santalab, Champions League winner Matthew Spiranovic, former Premier League player Jason Davidson, Socceroo Chris Ikonomidis and former La Liga player Juande. The season started with a pre-season friendly loss against Chelsea, with the match ending 0–1. Popovic&#x27;s first competitive game in charge was an FFA Cup fixture in the Round of 32 against Melbourne Victory, where the Glory lost 0–1. Perth started the regular A-League season strongly not losing their opening eight fixtures, the only team to do so that season. With two games to spare, Perth Glory confirmed their place at the top of the A-League, becoming the 2018–19 Premiers with a 1–0 win over Newcastle Jets, ending a 15-year trophy drought. The regular season ended with Perth winning 18 out of 27 matches in the league and only losing three games total, with only one away from home, earning a club record of 60 points overall. This also secured them a spot in their first continental competition, the 2020 AFC Champions League. The Finals Series saw the Glory reach their second A-League Grand Final ever, after defeating Adelaide United in the semi-final in a penalty shootout (5–4), following a 3–3 draw after extra time. The Grand Final, played against 2nd-placed Sydney, was hosted in Perth for the first time in the A-League era and the fourth time overall, with a record-breaking attendance of 56,371. Despite many chances for Perth to score and a controversial goal disallowed for being offside for Sydney, the game went goalless after extra-time. The penalty shoot-out ended 4–1 in Sydney&#x27;s favour.

For the 2019–20 season, new, promising players were brought into the squad. In March 2019, Perth confirmed they had signed Melbourne City FC striker Bruno Fornaroli on a two-year deal. Perth also signed other players including Brisbane Roar pair Dane Ingham and Nicholas D&#x27;Agostino, former Melbourne City defender Osama Malik, Swiss international Gregory Wüthrich and Socceroo James Meredith. Pre-season involved a friendly against Premier League giants, Manchester United which ended 2–0 to United. In the FFA Cup, Perth went down 1–2 in the round of 32 against the Western Sydney Wanderers. Following a poor start to the season, the Glory went on a ten match undefeated streak, moving into 2nd place after a draw against Brisbane Roar in round 20. In February 2020, Tony Sage confirmed that a majority of his stake in the club was set to be sold to the London Football Exchange, a football-based cryptocurrency exchange, a deal that eventually fell through due to growing speculation over the legitimacy of the sale. A drop in form occurred before the season was temporarily suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as a 0–1 loss in the Glory&#x27;s debut in the AFC Champions League against FC Tokyo. After the restart of the season, the Glory lost key players, such as Wuthrith and Castro, due to the ending of contracts and the inability of the club to meet wage demands due to the loss of revenue caused by the pandemic. The club was also in poor form and were conceding a high number of goals, eventually barely qualifying for the Finals series, finishing in 6th place. The Finals series saw the Glory win 1–0 against the 3rd placed Wellington Phoenix in the elimination final. The Glory&#x27;s ambition of going one further from the previous season ended after losing 0–2 against the premiers and eventual champions, Sydney FC, in the semi-final. A few days after this match, the club confirmed that Tony Popovic had left the club to take up a management role in the Greek club Xanthi, ending his successful two-year tenure with the club.

===Decline (2020–present)===

On 18 September 2020, Richard Garcia was appointed as Perth Glory coach, signing on for 2 seasons. His first competitive games in charge was at the 2020 AFC Champions League group stage whose final stages were held in Qatar due to an initial postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, Glory earned its first ever point in continental competition after a 3–3 draw with Shanghai Shenhua. Perth was eliminated in the group stage in its debut AFC Champions League season, after finishing 4th in its group with one point to its name. Garcia&#x27;s first full season in charge was mainly a disappointment. Inconsistent performances led to the Glory missing out on finals for the first time in three seasons and finishing in 9th, its second-lowest finishing position in its history at the time.

In March 2022, Garcia was terminated as coach after a poor start to his second season in charge and replaced by former player Ruben Zadkovich in a caretaker capacity. The 2021–22 season ended with Glory finishing bottom of the league for the first time in its history. Glory also failed to qualify for the 2022 Australia Cup, having lost to Newcastle Jets in the post-season play-off. Despite only recording one win in his tenure at the time, Zadkovich was confirmed as full-time coach in June 2022. In Zadkovich&#x27;s first and only season as permanent head coach, the Glory continued its run of poor results and performances, leaving Perth at the bottom of the table at the start of the 2022 World Cup break. Additionally, star striker Bruno Fornaroli was released following an alleged contract dispute, leaving the team with few recognised goal-scoring forwards. The club would eventually finish the season in 9th place, failing to qualify for the Finals series for a third-straight season. This was despite a relatively successful run of results at the club&#x27;s temporary home ground, Macedonia Park, where it played most home matches this season due to renovations occurring at Perth Rectangular Stadium for the 2023 Women&#x27;s World Cup.

Zadkovich departed the club at the end of the 2022–23 season. Former manager Kenny Lowe took charge of the club on an interim basis, overseeing the friendly against West Ham United and Australia Cup play-off against Macarthur in July 2023. In July 2023, Tony Sage stepped down as chairman of the club. The club was issued a breach notice &amp; Sage was stripped of the license due to financial turmoil that included requiring loans from the central administration of the league to pay staff &amp; player wages. On 3 August 2023, Perth Glory announced Alen Stajcic as the club&#x27;s new manager. On 17 October 2023, Robert Brij was announced as the new owner of the club. However, on 13 November 2023, the sale was terminated, leaving the club without an owner to start the new season. On 16 February 2024, the Pelligra Group was named the new owner of the club. The 2023–24 season went poorly overall, with the club finishing last for the second time in three seasons. Adam Taggart won the Golden Boot, finishing the season with 20 goals scored. On 25 June 2024, after one season at the club, the club announced Stajcic&#x27;s departure.

On 28 June 2024, David Zdrilic was announced as the club&#x27;s new head coach, following a stint as assistant at Sydney FC. Zdrilic&#x27;s first competitive game in charge was an Australia Cup play-off match against Brisbane Roar in Darwin. Perth emerged 2–4 victors, securing a spot in the competition&#x27;s round of 32, with their first win in the competition since 2016.

==Name, colours and badge==
Perth&#x27;s home kit as of the 2020–21 season is mainly purple, with orange stripes on the collar and arms. The kit also consists of purple shorts with orange trimming and purple socks. The away kit consists of a white jersey with orange and purple stripes throughout, including on the collar and arms, and a large purple strip behind the BHP sponsorship in the middle of the kit. The shorts are white with orange and purple trimming and the socks are white. In what was seen as something of a tribute to Glory&#x27;s past, the strip used for the 2009–10 season had vertical stripes, similar to what can be found on Glory&#x27;s jersey of 1996–97. On 23 October 2011, Perth Glory wore a predominantly blue jersey in recognition of the 125-year anniversary of their major sponsor, QBE Insurance, in a match against Wellington Phoenix.

The Glory&#x27;s original badge, used for the entire NSL era of the club, features sun rays that appear just above the word &#x27;Glory&#x27;, that utilises a soccer ball to represent the &#x27;O&#x27; in the word. The word &#x27;Perth&#x27; is also incorporated into the badge, in an arch above the soccer ball. In 2005 when the A-League was launched, the club decided a new badge was needed for the new era of Perth Glory. This badge has a similar layout to the original, retaining most of its elements, such as the soccer ball, the orange and purple colours and the sunbeams. In April 2009, a new shield badge for the club was unveiled, which features a soccer ball, sunbeams that protrude the outline of the badge and the colours of the original badge as well as a grey colour. Though completely divergent from previous designs, the new badge was received well in the general public. The change was viewed as the step to a new era of Perth Glory, attempting to appeal to fans. The club&#x27;s 15th and 20th year anniversaries were celebrated with one-off logos, in the 2011–12 season and the 2016–17 season respectively.

==Stadium==
Perth Glory have played their home games at Perth Rectangular Stadium (known as &quot;HBF Park&quot; for sponsorship purposes) since their inception, a stadium that holds 20,500 spectators.

The club played their first match in the National Soccer League at the ground in October 1996. For the first several seasons of the NSL, the club ground-shared with East Perth Football Club, a local Australian rules football club. A number of proposed permanent homes for the Glory were suggested in the late 1990s. As part of Multiplex&#x27;s contract to build the Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre, the construction company was required to build a rectangular stadium. The company was released from their contractual requirement after then-Glory chairman Nick Tana decided to proceed with a redevelopment of Leederville Oval. The Leederville Oval option was ultimately unsuccessful in the face of community opposition. In 2002, East Perth agreed to move to Leederville Oval and the state government agreed to turn Perth Oval into a dedicated rectangular venue.

The record attendance for an A-League match is 17,868 set in the semi-final against Adelaide United in the 2018–19 finals series, besting the previous record of 17,856, set when Glory hosted Melbourne Victory just a few weeks prior in round 23. The largest average season attendance in the A-League for the Glory is 10,533 in the 2016–17 season, while the largest attendance for any association football match at the ground was in November 1998 when 18,067 fans turned up to see a top-table clash with arch-rival South Melbourne.

With the arrival of the Western Force, in the Super 14 Rugby competition at the time, there was a push to have a 30,000+ capacity rectangular stadium in Perth. Western Force and Perth Glory joined forces to lobby the Western Australian Government for a ground of this size. The Force previously played games out of the 40,000-seat oval-shaped AFL ground Subiaco Oval, which hosted several Glory games before, generally NSL Finals games, most notably the 1999–2000 season NSL Grand Final when an all-time NSL record crowd of 43,242 fans saw Wollongong Wolves beat the Glory on penalties following a 3–3 draw. With the Force moving to nib Stadium prior to the 2010 Super 14 Season, a small increase in capacity was made to the ground, increasing capacity from around 18,000 to 20,500.

A major redevelopment occurred at Perth Rectangular Stadium starting in June 2012, with the southern and eastern stands being replaced with permanent structures. During the redevelopment, capacity was reduced during the 2012–13 A-League season. It was completed in September 2013, with a capacity of 20,441. There are plans to add a cover on the southern stand at a later stage.

===Headquarters===
In September 2021, the club moved their headquarters and training base to Fremantle Oval, south of Perth. In October 2024, it was announced that the club would move their headquarters to Stirling Leisure – Mirrabooka in 2025 on a five-year lease. Part of the adjacent Mirrabooka Regional Open Space will be used as the club&#x27;s training facility following $1.2 million in facility upgrades.

The main active support area in the stadium is &quot;&#x27;The Shed&#x27;&quot;, a covered terraced standing area at the northern end of the ground. The original Shed was located on the hill at the northeast of the ground and was relocated closer to the playing surface during redevelopment in 2003. The Shed is home to the supporters&#x27; group, the &quot;&#x27;Glory Shed Supporters Club (GSSC)&quot;&#x27;.

The Glory developed a rivalry against Wellington Phoenix after the side was established in 2007, titled &quot;&#x27;The Distance Derby&#x27;&quot;. It is based upon the two teams being considered as having one of the longest away trips in the world for a domestic league (5,255 km/3,270 mi). The two teams have had three tense finals games in the A-League, most recently with Perth Glory winning a finals match in the 2019–20 season. The rivalry was formally resurrected in the 2015–16 A-League season by means of awarding a new trophy called the &quot;&#x27;Long Distance Derby Cup&quot;&#x27;, based on the cumulative results from the 3 league games for the season. Perth Glory won this cup in its inaugural year.

The club also has a rivalry with former A-League side Gold Coast United, named the &quot;&#x27;Iron Ore Cup&quot;&#x27;. This rivalry was established due to a media-generated conflict which occurred before the two teams&#x27; met for the first time. The rivalry was named in such a way due to the owner of Perth, Tony Sage, and the owner of Gold Coast, Clive Palmer, having key involvements in the mining industry. The two sides have not played each other since Gold Coast was omitted from the league at the end of the 2011–12 A-League season.

Perth also developed a rivalry with former National Soccer League side Melbourne Knights. This rivalry started forming when the two sides competed against each other in a vital league match to qualify for finals during Glory&#x27;s inaugural season, which featured crowd violence and Perth player Paul Strudwick being sent off. Glory eventually lost the game 1–3, ending their hopes of finals in their first season. In May 2001 in a finals match played in Melbourne between the two sides, Perth player Bobby Despotovski performed a Serbian salute, enraging Melbourne Knights supporters who are prominently Croatian Australian. This led to Knights fans assaulting Despotovski and Glory manager Bernd Stange prior to them boarding the Perth team bus. This prompted Glory fans to plan retaliatory attacks against Melbourne&#x27;s team bus prior to the second leg of the match. The two sides have not played each other since the demise of the NSL in 2004.

==Ownership and finances==
In 1995, a consortium led by Nick Tana aimed to have a football team in Perth for the National Soccer League, subsequently Perth Glory were licensed to join the 1996–97 NSL season. In January 2004, Nick Tana announced he was planning to sell Perth Glory at the end of the season. On 30 April 2006, Tana and Football Federation Australia reached an agreement for FFA to take control of the club on 1 May 2006 to assume interim ownership of the club.

On 23 February 2007, Football Federation Australia announced triumvirate of local businessmen, Tony Sage, Brett McKeon and John Spence would take ownership of the club, with a commitment to make the club the powerhouse it was in the NSL. In 2008, Spence walked away from the club leaving Tony Sage and Brett McKeon as co-owners. On 18 February 2009, co-owner Brett McKeon quit the club as owner, making Tony Sage sole owner after buying out McKeon&#x27;s shares. Kenny Keogh also owned a small stake in the club.

On 19 December 2011, Tony Sage threatened to leave the club, however after apologising and dismissing his threats as an emotional outburst, he re-affirmed his commitment to the club. In February 2020, Tony Sage confirmed that a majority of his stake in the club was set to be sold to the London Football Exchange, a football-based cryptocurrency exchange. This deal, however, eventually fell through due to growing speculation over its legitimacy. In July 2023, Tony Sage stepped down as chairman, with the Australian Professional Leagues (APL) being appointed as receivers of the club to manage its sale.

On 17 October 2023, the APL confirmed that Australian property developer Robert Brij would be the new owner of the club, together with John Nekic (who is to be the incoming chairman), both of Primeland Group. On 13 November 2023, it was reported that the sale to Robert Brij would be terminated just days before the formal takeover with the APL now engaging with other parties to secure a new buyer.

On 14 February 2024, Fairfax news outlets reported that Ross Pelligra, who also owns Italian club Catania FC under Pelligra Group, had agreed a deal to acquire the club although it had not yet been officially announced by the APL. The club confirmed the new ownership on 16 February 2024 with Pelligra becoming the club&#x27;s chairman.

==Honours==
Perth Glory won its first piece of major silverware in the 1999–2000 season, with the premiership being won, and won their second premiership in the 2001–02 season. Despite reaching the grand final in both respective seasons, the Glory lost both, 3–3 (6–7 on penalties) against Wollongong Wolves and 0–1 against Olympic Sharks respectively. In the Glory&#x27;s third grand final attempt in 2003, the club won their first Australian championship, after defeating Olympic Sharks 2–0. In the following season, the last season of the National Soccer League, Perth won their first and only double. This consisted of the winning of their third premiership and second championship, after defeating Parramatta Power through the scoring of a golden goal in extra time in the 2004 grand final.

Perth had a decline in form after the start of the A-League, failing to reach the finals series for several seasons. Despite reaching the 2012 grand final, as well as two Australia Cup finals and two A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup finals, the Glory failed to win silverware in the A-League era until the 2018–19 season. In this season, the club won its fourth premiership, with Tony Popovic as the manager of the side, ending a 15-year silverware drought and equalling the record for the most domestic premierships won, held by the Melbourne Knights at the time. Perth also hosted a grand final for the first time since 2003 in the same season, eventually losing on penalties to Sydney.

<doc id="1257164" wikidata="Q6800947" url="?curid=1257164" title="McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo">
<text>The McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo was an all-weather interceptor aircraft operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Canadian Forces between 1961 and 1984. They were manufactured by the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation of St. Louis, Missouri for the United States Air Force (as F-101s), and later sold to Canada. CF-101s replaced the obsolete Avro CF-100 Canuck in the RCAF&#x27;s all-weather fighter squadrons. The Voodoo&#x27;s primary armament was nuclear AIR-2A Genie unguided air-to-air rockets, and there was significant political controversy in Canada about their adoption. Although they never fired a weapon in wartime, the CF-101 served as Canada&#x27;s primary means of air defence from Quick Reaction Alert facilities at Canadian airbases. The CF-101s were retired in the 1980s and replaced with McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet fighters. Many examples are preserved in museums and parks in Canada and the United States.

==Acquisition==

===Origins===
After the cancellation of the CF-105 Arrow program in February 1959, George Pearkes, the Canadian Minister of National Defence, officially maintained that the existing Avro CF-100 interceptors and the Bomarc missiles that had been ordered in September 1958 would be adequate for Canada&#x27;s air defence needs. Unofficially, it was recognized that there was still a bomber threat, and talks had been underway prior to the Avro Arrow&#x27;s termination on the RCAF acquisition of an &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; interceptor from the United States.

The USAF indicated its readiness to supply 56 F-101B interceptors and 10 F-101F trainers (by employing Convair F-102 Delta Daggers in less demanding NORAD sectors) for Canada. The deal was delayed by over a year by negotiations over offsets and acquisition costs, as well as debate within the Diefenbaker government about Canada adopting nuclear weapons systems, which had been agreed to in principle in 1958. The financial arrangements were settled by Canada taking on the staffing and funding of 11 Pinetree Line radar stations within Canada that had formerly been operated and funded by the USAF. An agreement signed in June 1961 covered the transfer of the aircraft, meant to equip five front-line squadrons (replacing nine CF-100 squadrons) and an Operational Training Unit (OTU).

===Nuclear weapons controversy===

The issue of nuclear weapons in Canada had not been resolved in June 1961, thus the CF-101s were armed only with their secondary AIM-4D Falcon missiles. In April 1963, the issue led to the collapse of the Diefenbaker government. The succeeding Pearson government signed an agreement with the United States concerning nuclear arms for Canada on 16 August 1963. The agreement did not actually state that Canada was acquiring nuclear weapons; the Canadian government usually refused to confirm or deny that there were any nuclear arms in Canada. The agreement specifically stated that the AIR-2A Genie rockets were the property of the United States and would only be released to Canada for actual use with the joint agreement of Canada and the United States through NORAD. The stringent training requirements meant that it took until June 1965 for the Genies to become operational in Canada. The Genies were kept in the custody of the USAF, with detachments of the 425th Munitions Support Squadron located at each of the Canadian bases.

==Operational history==

On 24 July 1961, the first two Voodoos were transferred to Canada in a ceremony at RCAF Uplands in Ottawa, marking the beginning of Operation Queen&#x27;s Row. 425 Squadron officially began operations at RCAF Namao, Alberta, on 15 October 1961, initially acting as the conversion training squadron for 410, 416, 409, and 414 Squadrons. No. 425 then became an operational unit itself, turning the conversion role over to No. 3 All Weather OTU at RCAF Bagotville, Quebec. By the end of 1962, the squadrons were operating out of RCAF Comox, British Columbia, (409 Squadron), RCAF North Bay, Ontario, (414 Squadron), RCAF Uplands, Ottawa, Ontario, (410 Squadron), RCAF Bagotville, Quebec, (425 Squadron), and RCAF Chatham, New Brunswick, (416 Squadron). Defence cuts in 1964 eliminated Nos. 410 and 414 Squadrons (although a reformed 414 Squadron would operate the Voodoo years later).
Each Voodoo base was laid out to allow aircraft to be kept at immediate readiness at all times. A Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) facility was positioned at the end of the main runway to allow alert aircraft to launch as quickly as possible. Two aircraft and their crews were always on &quot;five minute&quot; alert — they were to be in the air, en route to intercept unknown aircraft, within five minutes of receiving the order. In one instance, 416 Squadron got two alert aircraft in the air only 57 seconds after receiving the alert. Voodoos were regularly dispatched to intercept unidentified NORAD radar contacts, usually off course airliners, although 416 and 425 occasionally intercepted Soviet Tu-95 Bear bombers flying along the Atlantic coast to Cuba. Fortunately, no situation arose in which a CF-101 pilot fired his weapons in anger.

Between 1970 and 1972, Canada traded the 56 survivors of the original CF-101 fleet back to the USAF for 66 replacements under Operation Peace Wings. These replacement aircraft were actually manufactured earlier than the original fleet, but the &quot;new&quot; airframes had a lower number of hours and had received updates that the original Canadian Voodoos had not (such as an IR tracking system). Bristol Aerospace of Winnipeg, Manitoba performed modifications on the incoming fleet such as transferring some specifically Canadian equipment, including engines, from the old aircraft to the new. Most of the old Canadian Voodoos were scrapped in the US, but 22 were converted to RF-101B photo-reconnaissance versions and flew with the Nevada Air National Guard until 1975.

During its service, the CF-101 was a popular performer at airshows and other events in Canada and the United States. In 1967, a CF-101 flew (in company with a CF-104 and The Red Knight T-33) in the Golden Centennaires display team to mark the nation&#x27;s Centennial. In 1984, each squadron painted a special &quot;show&quot; aircraft to commemorate the type&#x27;s impending retirement.

===Obsolescence and retirement===
Through the 1970s, the increasing obsolescence of the CF-101 and the CF-104 led to the New Fighter Aircraft program. Launched in 1977, the program sought a replacement for the CF-5, CF-104 Starfighter, and CF-101 Voodoo. The Grumman F-14 Tomcat, F-15 Eagle, F-16 Falcon, McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, Panavia Tornado, Dassault Mirage F1, and the Mirage 2000 were evaluated as potential replacements. Cost considerations reduced the choice to the F-16 and F-18; the F-18 was ultimately selected in April 1980. The Voodoo OTU converted to CF-18 Hornets in June 1982; 409 and 425 Squadrons also stood down in June 1984. In 1985, 416 Squadron moved from CFB Chatham, New Brunswick to CFB Cold Lake, Alberta and converted from the Voodoo to the Hornet. With the stand down, the last nuclear weapons in Canada were returned to the US.

Two Voodoos remained in service after the stand-down: the unique &quot;EF-101B&quot; &quot;Electric Voodoo&quot; electronic jamming aircraft and a single CF-101F trainer with 414 Squadron at North Bay, Ontario. The EF-101B was a conversion of a regular F-101B, incorporating the electronic jamming suite from an EB-57E Canberra. Only one aircraft was converted before the program was cancelled and this sole example was leased to Canada. The EF-101B was returned to the United States on 7 April 1987, while CF-101F 101006 made the world&#x27;s last Voodoo flight on 9 April 1987, as it made a delivery flight from CFB North Bay to CFB Greenwood via CFB Bagotville and CFB Chatham for eventual display at CFB Cornwallis, Nova Scotia, where it decorated the parade square at the Recruit School. After CFB Cornwallis closed in 1995, 006 was moved to the Cornwallis Military Museum; in October 2013, due to corrosion and security concerns, 006 was donated to the Jet Aircraft Museum in London, Ontario, where it is presently undergoing refurbishment.

<text>Marion Phillips (29 October 1881 – 23 January 1932) was an Australian-born British Labour Party politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1929 to 1931.

== Early life and education ==
Marion Phillips was born on 29 October 1881 in St Kilda, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, in colonial Australia. Her parents were Philip David Phillips, Jewish Australian lawyer, and Rose Asher, who was from New Zealand. She was educated at the Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College, Melbourne and University of Melbourne, graduating in 1903. In 1904, she began a research scholarship at the London School of Economics, graduating as a Doctor of Science in 1907, with a thesis about the development of New South Wales. Between 1906 and 1910, she worked under the direction of Beatrice Webb on a commission investigating the Poor Laws.

== Career ==
A member of the Women&#x27;s Labour League from 1908, she became its secretary in 1912. She also edited the League&#x27;s leaflet, which by 1913 became Labour Woman. When World War I broke out she became a member of the War Emergency Workers&#x27; National Committee. In 1916, Phillips was present at the formation of the Standing Joint Committee of Industrial Women&#x27;s Organisations. Phillips was its secretary between 1917 and 1932.

Phillips also served on a number of government committees before a woman had been elected to the country&#x27;s parliament. The most significant were the Consumer Council of the Ministry of Food and the Women&#x27;s Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Reconstruction.

Unlike prominent suffragettes, her vision was not concentrated upon extending the franchise, she wanted state interventions in the free market to be better informed by considerations of life outside the workplace. As a leader of the Women&#x27;s Labour League, she described its role as &quot;keeping the Labour Party well informed of the needs of women and providing women with the means of becoming educated in political matters&quot;. In this endeavour she provoked about a quarter of a million housewives to take part in the labour movement and helped popularise issues such as equality for women in the workplace, school meals, clinics and playspaces for children, the fundamental value of mothering, a more humanitarian, safety-conscious, approach to the design of homes for ordinary families, and an eradication of needless drudgery and squalour from home life.

Together with Margaret Bondfield, Phillips &quot;worked tirelessly within the WLL to raise the political consciousness of women and encourage their participation.&quot; It has been noted of Phillips and Bondfield that &quot;although there was some tension between the two at the start, they eventually worked in harmony and shared an essentially social class based approach to women&#x27;s emancipation and both were later Labour MPs together in 1929 (Bondfield having briefly been an MP in 1924).&quot;

Speaking on the need for adequate bathing and washing facilities in new housing projects, Phillips remarked: &quot;If Labour councillors will not support us on this demand, we shall have to cry a halt on all municipal housing until we have replaced all Labour men by Labour women&quot;. Addressing women in Hartlepool, she emphasised, &quot;There is still a lot of educating to do and we are going to begin by educating ourselves&quot;.

As Chief Woman Officer of the Labour Party, she reportedly gave women extra confidence to engage in politics, and by 1925, the Women&#x27;s Section was firmly established.

At the 1929 general election, Phillips was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Sunderland. The 1929 &#x27;flapper election&#x27; was the first in which women under the age of 30 were eligible to vote. In July 1928, Phillips wrote to all women in the Sunderland constituency, stating that &#x27;FOR WOMEN ESPECIALLY, THIS NEXT ELECTION WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE IN 1929 IS VERY IMPORTANT&#x27;. She lost the 1931 election, and in 1932 died of stomach cancer, aged 50. Phillips was the first Jewish, and thus first non-Christian woman MP. Nonetheless, she was also an atheist.

In September 2019, a plaque was unveiled at 18 Foyle Street, the site of the Sunderland Labour Party&#x27;s former Committee Rooms. It reads &quot;Sunderland&#x27;s first woman MP had an office here 1929-1931. Activist and academic, she lobbied for the rights of woman and working people. The Labour Party&#x27;s Chief Woman Officer (1918-1932)&quot;.

<text>Melbourne Victory Football Club is an Australian professional soccer club based in Melbourne, Victoria. Competing in the country&#x27;s premier men&#x27;s competition, the A-League Men, under licence from Australian Professional Leagues (APL), Victory entered the competition in the inaugural season as the only Victorian-based club in the newly revamped domestic Australian league.

Recognised as the second most successful club in the league to date, Victory has won four A-League Championships, three A-League Premierships, one Pre-Season Challenge Cup and two Australia Cups, the only club to have won all four domestic trophies in the modern era of Australian soccer. They have also competed in the AFC Champions League on seven occasions, most recently in 2020. Their furthest placement in the tournament was in the 2016 campaign and 2020 campaign, where they were knocked out in the Round of 16 by the eventual champion on both occasions.

The club&#x27;s home ground is the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium, currently known as &quot;AAMI Park&quot; for sponsorship purposes, a 30,050-seat stadium on Olympic Boulevard in Melbourne&#x27;s city centre. The Victory has previously played its home matches at other stadiums throughout Melbourne and surrounding areas, including Olympic Park Stadium, Docklands Stadium and Kardinia Park.

Although Victory is supported across the whole Melbourne metropolitan area, as well as regional cities in the state, it is based primarily in the city centre. The club has rivalries with Melbourne City (the Melbourne Derby), Sydney (The Big Blue), Adelaide United (The Original Rivalry), and Western United (the Westgate Derby/the Battle of the Bridge). The club&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer is Archie Thompson, with 97 goals to his name in all competitions. Leigh Broxham has the record for most matches played, with 405 appearances for the Victory.

==History==
===Beginning (2004–2005)===
Following the demise of the National Soccer League, Australia&#x27;s first national soccer first tier competition, Melbourne Victory Football Club was unveiled as Melbourne&#x27;s representative of the newly established A-League, along with seven other foundation clubs on 1 November 2004. Established as an unlisted public company, inaugural chairman Geoff Lord of Belgravia Leisure Pty Ltd was the largest financial backer of the club with support from other Melbourne-based business men consisting of Ron Peck, John Harris, future chief executive officer Richard Wilson, and future chairman Anthony Di Pietro. Despite a diverse range of owners of different industry backgrounds, the consortium managed to raise only $4.5 million of the $5 million budget minimum set by Football Federation Australia, thus resulting in the federation depositing the needed $500,000 to obtain the license with the condition of imposing one board member performing duties in the best interests of the federation to ensure return on investment.

The inaugural manager was Ernie Merrick who had signed his former Sunshine George Cross defender Kevin Muscat to be inaugural captain, alongside marquee Archie Thompson, both of whom would become legends of the soccer club in their own right. The club&#x27;s first competitive match was against Newcastle Jets on 22 July 2005 in round one of the A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup, finishing in a 1–1 draw in Newcastle. The club&#x27;s first competitive home game would also prove to be the club&#x27;s first win on 30 July 2005 in a 3–0 against Perth Glory in the cup&#x27;s second round at Olympic Park.

===Merrick Era and early glory (2005–2011)===
The league&#x27;s inaugural season of 2005–06 proved to be a disappointment in conclusion but also a glimpse into the glory that would follow in 2006–07 and 2008–09 seasons, with the club being first on the ladder mid-season but ultimately finishing second last. Future team of the decade players Danny Allsopp, Leigh Broxham, Archie Thompson, Grant Brebner, Adrian Leijer, Rodrigo Vargas, Michael Theoklitos under captain Kevin Muscat and manager Ernie Merrick would achieve glory in winning its first league premiership and championship in the 2006–07 season, qualifying for its inaugural AFC Champions League. Archie Thompson in A-League history is synonymous with the glory of famously scoring the first five goals in the 6–0 grand final win over Adelaide United in front of a current record crowd for a grand final of 55&#x27;436 at Docklands Stadium. The heavy defeat for Adelaide as well as an altercation between Muscat and manager John Kosmina earlier in the season is culturally seen as the beginning of the rivalry, earning the nicknames &#x27;the cross-border rivalry&#x27; and &#x27;the original rivalry&#x27;.

The 2007–08 season proved to be another disappointment with Victory narrowly missing the finals. Hindered by multiple injuries throughout the season and the inexperience of time &amp; energy management whilst trying to compete in the club&#x27;s inaugural AFC Champions League campaign of 2008 at full strength, Melbourne narrowly missed the finals but the season did bring long term positives. The acquisition of future team of the decade players Carlos Hernández, Matthew Kemp, and Tom Pondeljak would ensure on-field strength for next three seasons. The 2008–09 season brought more success for the club in achieving its first treble. The last A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup of 2008, finishing top of the ladder as premiers resulting in qualifying a second time in the AFC Champions League for the 2010 campaign, and being crowned champions after defeating Adelaide United a second time in a grand final in front of a crowd of 53,273, which as of January 2019, is still the second largest attendance for an A-League grand final behind the 2007 final. The 2009–10 season saw Victory be serious competitors for first position but would ultimately and narrowly finish behind Sydney FC, whom Victory would lose 2–4 on penalties in the grand final weeks later. It would prove to be the last grand final for manager Ernie Merrick and for Kevin Muscat as captain, with Victory finishing fifth for the 2010–11 season, and losing to Gold Coast in first round of the finals.

===Exit Lord, enter Di Pietro, and the rebuild (2011–2013)===

The conclusion of the 2010–11 A-League season saw inaugural president Geoff Lord resign from the club, hailing from the success of two championships, two premierships and the last pre-season challenge cup. Fruit and vegetable heavyweight and shareholder Anthony Di Pietro became the second president in the club&#x27;s history, hired internally after being an inaugural director alongside Lord from the beginning. Di Pietro was also an occasional stand-in president when Lord was unable to perform duties due to illness on multiple occasions in 2011, making his first public speech ever being stand in chairman at the time during a Victory in Business luncheon at the Crown Palladium Ballroom. Along with the resignation of Lord, inaugural chief executive officer Geoff Miles also resigned from the club, with mortgage firm businessman, shareholder and inaugural director Richard Wilson being hired internally prior to the 2011–12 season alongside Di Pietro. Ernie Merrick would depart as coach after Di Pietro &amp; Wilson quickly sacked Merrick following multiple missed targets both on &amp; off the field, with the 5–1 loss to Gamba Osaka in the 2011 AFC Champions League campaign being the last straw. Merrick would be replaced by Mehmet Duraković and later Jim Magilton for the 2011–12 season.

 Kevin Muscat had announced during the respective season that he would retire as a player, and immediately became an assistant coach replacing Aaron Healy. Along with Merrick &amp; Healy&#x27;s departures would be inaugural director of football Gary Cole, and would be replaced by former team South Melbourne and Socceroo teammate, Francis Awaritefe.

The two new-coming executives famously won the race against Sydney FC and other soccer clubs world-wide to sign Socceroos hero Harry Kewell to the club, being declared at the time &#x27;the biggest signing in the history of Australian sport&#x27; at the time. With much anticipation for the lead up to the 2011–12 A-League season, the season proved to be a disappointment in missing the finals for the time third in the club&#x27;s history. Multiple aged players, a less experienced revamped coaching team led by Mehmet Durakovic who was promoted by default that would later be replaced mid-season by Jim Magilton, and a high maintenance Harry Kewell all contributed to the team falling short on multiple match day results. Late in the season, Magilton would sign future team of the decade players Mark Milligan and Adama Traoré. Durakovic&#x27;s unsung legacy on the club would be the signing of then nineteen year-old Lawrence Thomas, who would later win multiple championships with the club under Kevin Muscat. Despite the disappointment, the lessons were learned and the club would have its most improved season to date as of 2019, finishing third in the 2012–13 season from eighth in the season prior, narrowly losing the preliminary final to premiers and eventual champions Central Coast Mariners 0–1. The season started with a major sense of optimism by signing by multiple Brisbane Roar and National Soccer League premiership and championship-winning coach Ange Postecoglou on a three-year deal, revamping the playing squad with the departure of fourteen players and the signings of fifteen players, including Gui Finkler and Nathan Coe who would achieve multiple club and personal accolades respectively in their own rite in the years to come.

===Coaching Disruptions (2013–14 season)===
Prior to the season, coach Ange Postecoglou had just begun the second year of his three-year contract with the club, but had also been cited as a possible replacement for departing Australian national team coach Holger Osieck, in the lead-up to the 2014 FIFA World Cup. This possibility became a reality the day before the round three clash against Postecoglou&#x27;s former club Brisbane Roar on 25 October, which was his last match in charge. Victory were denied a compensation claim of one million Australian dollars for the early departure.

===Muscat era and glory again (2013–2019)===

The era of Kevin Muscat becoming the first former player and captain to become manager began sooner than anticipated, but it would be an era that would restore the former early glory of Australia&#x27;s biggest association football club. The era officially began following the untimely departure of Ange Postecoglou in round four of the 2013–14 season on 4 November 2013, in a 3–2 home victory over Wellington Phoenix at Docklands Stadium. Future grand final winners James Troisi, Kosta Barbarouses and Rashid Mahazi were signed to the club and would help strengthen the playing squad in the years to come. Muscat&#x27;s first season would end in both heartbreak and controversy as Victory were denied obvious penalty decisions in the last minutes of both the A-League finals clash against Brisbane Roar, and in the last group stage clash against Jeonbuk in the 2014 AFC Champions League, when in both games one extra goal was needed to win. Both controversial moments occurred only days in between each other, resulting in Muscat heavily criticizing referees in general.

The 2014–15 season saw a major recruiting drive in the signings of Besart Berisha, Carl Valeri, Daniel Georgievski, Fahid Ben Khalfallah and Mathieu Delpierre, who would all go onto achieve multiple personal and club accolades respectively. Late in the season on 28 March 2015, the club announced its team of the decade at the Crown palladium ballroom with five of the announced players still contracted to victory at the time, with then coach Kevin Muscat also being listed. This time of the season also saw captaincy of the club change with Adrian Leijer departing the Victory for Chinese Super League club Chongqing Lifan on an undisclosed transfer for a major salary increase, with teammate Mark Milligan becoming interim captain for the remainder of the season. After a six-year wait, Victory would finish first on the ladder and would later defeat Sydney FC 3–0 in the grand final. Team of the decade substitute goalkeeper Nathan Coe, who would miss the grand final due to injury announced his retirement shortly after the achievement.

The next two seasons were of mixed results, but the squad would remain competitive and be rewarded. The 2015–16 season was of mixed results in the A-League, but the squad would win the 2015 FFA Cup, and for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, would progress to the round of sixteen in the Asian Champions League. Captain and marquee Mark Milligan departed the club during the preseason and was replaced by 2014 World Cup teammate Oliver Bozanic, with Carl Valeri given the captaincy role. Defender Thomas Deng would be promoted from the youth squad and feature occasionally throughout the season. Veterans Mathieu Delpierre and Archie Thompson retired at the season&#x27;s conclusion and Deng would be loaned to Jong PSV, but the season would be mostly remembered for newly promoted captain Carl Valeri contracting a brain inflammation in December 2015, but would later return in the finals. The 2016–17 season saw an improvement in results in the A-League, with the squad finishing second on the ladder, ultimately losing in what was a demoralising defeat in the grand final to their superior rivals and premiers Sydney FC, making both clubs equal in premierships and championships. The season saw the returns of James Troisi and team of the decade winger Marco Rojas. Defender James Donachie joined from Brisbane Roar, and the club&#x27;s youth squad would promote Christian Theoharous and Stefan Nigro.

The 2017–18 season ended in glory but would see multiple difficulties in the lead up to the finals. In the preseason, 2017 grand final Johnny Warren medalist Daniel Georgievski departed the club willfully, with Marco Rojas and Nick Ansell both being sold. Rhys Williams and Leroy George signed in the preseason and would prove to be crucial players. With mixed results throughout the season, coach Kevin Muscat was criticised for his &#x27;stale&#x27; game plan. Mid-season, captain Mark Milligan and defender Jason Geria would both be sold, and Terry Antonis would join the club on a two-and-a-half-year deal. Despite pressure, the squad gained form towards the end of the season despite losing to premiers Sydney FC away at Sydney Football Stadium in the last round and finished fourth. Victory would beat Adelaide United in the elimination final 2–1, led by future coach Marco Kurz at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium, to then face Sydney FC in the semi-final away. In the lead up to the clash, Sydney captain Alex Brosque told the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; when asked regarding the reverse fixture with victory that &quot;I know they&#x27;ll be thinking about it as much as they&#x27;ll try to forget about it.&quot; also stating that &quot;It gives us a lot of confidence and psychologically I&#x27;m sure it will be playing on their minds,&quot;. In the warm up of the game, crucial defender Rhys Williams suffered an ankle injury that would rule him out of the game and the grand final if Victory would win. The Victory as underdogs would beat Sydney 3–2 in extra time, with victory physically scoring all five goals, with own goals by Stefan Nigro and Terry Antonis. Despite the unfortunate error, Nigro&#x27;s efforts in the match being a late replacement for the injured Williams would secure him a start in the grand final. Antonis, a former youth product and five seasoned player of Sydney, conceded the own goal in the last minute of regular time to bring the score to 2–2, leading to extra time. In the 117th minute, loanee teammate Kenny Athiu would pass the ball to Antonis, surviving three tackle attempts in running from the centre line to within Sydney&#x27;s eighteen yard box to score the winning goal, in what would later be recognised as the club&#x27;s 2017–18 goal of the season. Victory would travel to Newcastle to face second placed Newcastle Jets, led by former and inaugural Victory manager Ernie Merrick. It would be the A-League&#x27;s first ever regional grand final as well as one manager versing his former player as a manager in a grand final, and would be remembered for its controversy. Victory scored the earliest ever goal in a grand final from a Leroy George free kick that would be headed into the centre of the eighteen yard box by James Donachie then scored by Kosta Barbarouses in the ninth minute. Replays had shown that Donachie was offside upon George kicking the ball, but with the views of the linesman deceived by a Newcastle defender, the goal was allowed to stand as the video assistant referee had temporarily failed. Victory would win 1–0 against a ten men Newcastle after striker Roy O&#x27;Donovan desperately attempted to volley a high altitude ball from a free kick that infamously resulted in goalkeeper Lawrence Thomas being kicked in the face causing an altercation to follow. The incident resulted in a ten match ban for O&#x27;Donovan going into the 2018–19 season despite an appeal. Thomas later told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he had accepted O&#x27;Donovan&#x27;s immediate apology after full-time. The achievement made Victory leaders in the number of championships won by an A-League club, as well as being the first team to win a grand final after finishing fourth place in the regular season, the lowest ladder position. Weeks later, six grand final players departed the club, including Besart Berisha being sold for an undisclosed fee to Sanfrecce Hiroshima.

Despite the unexpected grand final achievement, Muscat would commence a recruiting drive that would see eight players join preseason, including 2018 World Cup players and Keisuke Honda and Ola Toivonen. Mid-season transfers saw the undisclosed sale of Nick Ansell, and the recruitment of Elvis Kamsoba and Anthony Lesiotis, this first ever former Melbourne City player to represent Victory. Despite being more competitive than the season prior considering that Honda was sidelined more over a third of the season with injury, it would ultimately end in disappointment. The squad would finish third by one point behind the second placed and eventual champions Sydney FC, meaning that Victory would not receive direct entrance into the group stage of the 2020 AFC Champions League, but would have to enter a play-off first. The true realization of the disappointment in finishing third would be realised in the semi-final against Sydney away, who would exact revenge for their 2017–18 semi final upset in which Victory were defeated 1–6 away. Despite having one more season on his contract, Muscat resigned from the club weeks later for personal reasons, closing a fourteen-year stint at the club as a player, captain, assistant manager, and head coach.

===Post-Muscat era (2019–2021)===
Following Muscat&#x27;s early departure, the Melbourne Victory board interviewed multiple foreign and local coaches for the senior role. It was announced in late June 2019 that former Adelaide United coach Marco Kurz was signed on a two-year deal. During the recruitment process, nine players departed the club, including the retirement of captain Carl Valeri who would become an office administrator for the club. Eight senior players were signed including the return of team of the decade defender Adama Traoré, and the youth academy had promoted defensive players Benjamin Carrigan and Brandon Lauton. In early October, weeks before the first round of the 2019–20 season, Ola Toivonen was appointed captain.

In January 2020, after just 6 months in the role Kurz was dismissed by the club. Kurz left having managed the Victory for just thirteen competitive matches, for four wins, three draws and six losses. The six defeats were the most losses the Victory had suffered after thirteen games of a season. At the time of his dismissal, the Victory were sixth on the league ladder with fifteen points, their equal lowest points tally after thirteen games alongside the 2007–08 and 2011–12 seasons. Assistant coach Carlos Pérez Salvachúa was appointed as caretaker manager of the Victory until the conclusion of the season. However, on 30 May 2020, with 5 regular season A-League matches remaining in Melbourne Victory&#x27;s season, Salvachúa departed the club to return to Europe to be closer to his family. Assistant coach and former player Grant Brebner was appointed as the Victory&#x27;s caretaker manager for the remainder of the season; he was later appointed promoted to permanent manager on 24 August 2020.

Brebner&#x27;s tenure as Melbourne Victory manager coincided with the worst run of results in Melbourne Victory&#x27;s history. He was sacked as head coach shortly after Victory&#x27;s 7–0 loss to local rivals Melbourne City in April 2021, a result which came only a month and a half after losing 6–0 to the same team. On 19 April 2021, Victory assistant coach Steve Kean was appointed as interim coach for the remainder of the 2020–21 A-League season as Victory plummeted to 12th place, becoming the first ever A-League side to finish 12th and Victory won their first ever wooden spoon.

===Popovic era (2021–2024)===

On 22 April 2021, the Victory announced that Tony Popovic will take over as the club&#x27;s manager from the beginning of the 2021–22 season. On 5 February 2022, the Victory defeated the Central Coast Mariners 2-1 at AAMI Park to win the 2021 FFA Cup, achieving Popovic&#x27;s first trophy as manager of the club, as well as the Victory&#x27;s second FFA Cup title. This was the last edition of the competition under the FFA Cup name; from 2022, the competition will be known as the Australia Cup.

In the lead up to the 2022–23 A-League Men season, the club announced the signing of former Manchester United and Portugal national team great Nani on Tuesday 12 July 2022, on a two-year contract, and was allocated the number seventeen jersey. On the following Friday 15 July 2022, the club played against Manchester United at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, as participant in United&#x27;s 2022 pre-season tour of East Asia. Nani made his unofficial debut as substitute in front of the 74,157 spectators present, with the match finishing in 1–4 loss.

In the lead up to the opening 2022-23 A-League round, commentator Michael Zappone stated that &#x27;for me, they&#x27;re Melbourne Victory the favourites to win the title this season.&#x27;
Following the World Cup break, on 12 December 2022, preceding the Christmas Melbourne Derby fixture, the Australian Professional Leagues announced an agreement with Destination NSW that would see the 2023, 2024, and 2025 A-League Men Grand Finals hosted in Sydney, as opposed to the traditional format of being hosted by the finalist that finished higher during the regular season. This announcement was met with widespread opposition from fans. A 20th minute walkout was staged by the former active groups of both clubs, Original Style Melbourne and City Terrace. In the 20th minute, the match was suspended by referee Alex King as flares were thrown onto both sides of the pitch. Tom Glover threw one of a flare back into the crowd of Victory supporters, sparking a pitch invasion where Glover was struck with a metal bucket. Security, a Channel 10 Cameraman, and referee Alex King were also subject to the violence. The pitch invasion forced the Derby&#x27;s abandonment in the 22nd minute (score being 1–0 to City) due to concerns with player safety.

On December 18, 2022, Football Australia issued Melbourne Victory with a show cause notice, for the club to show cause on why they should not face serious sanctions for bringing the game into disrepute.

On December 23, 2022, Football Australia imposed interim sanctions on Melbourne Victory while the show cause process was worked through. These sanctions included:

* No tickets sold in respect to Home matches.
* Home and away active bays will be closed.

On January 9, 2023, following interim sanctions by FA which restricted active support, purchase of tickets to the general public and total North end blockage with tarps, the FA handed down the final sanctions to Melbourne Victory for the events at the Christmas Derby, after Melbourne Victory&#x27;s show cause response was considered.

Football Australia found that Melbourne Victory FC brought the game into disrepute. Sanctions include:

* A total financial sanction of $550,000 AUD
* No organised seating for away fans for the remainder of the season and finals series.
* No organised home active support for the remainder of the season and finals series.
* A suspended 10 point deduction triggered if fan behaviour results in the suspension of a game, ending at the conclusion of 2025/26 A-League season.
In response to the show cause determination by FA, the Club stated that they would not appeal the decision and separately stated that they were ‘committed to the disbandment of any A-League Men&#x27;s active supporter groups that were recognised at the time of the incident’. The Christmas Derby was resumed on Wednesday 5 April 2023 at the 21st minute, with the game ending 2–1 in favour of Melbourne City.

777Partners invested into Melbourne Victory FC in October 2022. In early February, Melbourne Victory&#x27;s board approved 777Partners’ purchase of 70% of the club for 5 years.

The first half of Melbourne Victory&#x27;s 2022–23 season was the worst in the club&#x27;s history. They would only pick up 12 points in 14 matches and were at the bottom of the ladder.

Consequently, the Club looked to improve the squad in the January transfer window, signing Bruce Kamau, Damien Da Silva, Connor Chapman, Fernando Romero, the permanent signing of Bruno Fornaroli, and resignings of William Wilson, Matthew Bozinovski, and Ben Folami.

On 23 April 2023, Michael Zappone revealed that the Melbourne Victory board had supposedly chosen not to activate a second season clause in Luis Nani&#x27;s contract, meaning that the marquee player who suffered a partial ACL tear would not return to the club in season 2023–24. However, head coach Tony Popovic stated that a decision has not been made on Nani&#x27;s future.

Melbourne Victory completed the 2022-23 A-League Men&#x27;s season with a 1–0 home loss to eventual 8th place Brisbane Roar, narrowly missing out on the wooden spoon which was avoided through a 94th-minute winner by Lleyton Brooks in the previous game against eventual wooden spooners and reigning Australia Cup winners Macarthur FC. Melbourne Victory finished the regular season in 11th place, condemning the club to a third bottom two finish in four years and another Australia Cup qualifier.

On May 3, 2023, the club hosted its annual Victory Medal. Former Melbourne City striker Bruno Fornaroli won the Player&#x27;s Player of the Year and the TAC Golden Boot. Mid season Ligue 1 import Damien Da Silva won the prestigious Victory Medal, only playing 12 games in the season, a club record. Matthew Bozinovski won the Young Player of the Year award.

On May 4, 2023, following the conclusion of the 2022-23 A-League Men&#x27;s season, Melbourne Victory announced the departure of first year signings Tomi Juric and &#x27;Kadete&#x27;, as well as the release of youngster Lleyton Brooks and keeper Matt Acton, who had been at the club for seven years. This would add to the departures of Noah Smith, Jay Barnett, Matthew Spiranovic, and Nick D&#x27;Agostino who all departed the club during the season.

On May 4, 2023, almost 5 hours after the departure of four Victory players were announced, the Club confirmed that Fabrizio Cammarata, Luciano Trani and Goalkeeper Coach, Peter Zois would not continue with the senior men&#x27;s side in the 2023–24 season. The group of coaches were appointed by Tony Popovic when he joined the Club at the start of the 2021–22 season.

Main Melbourne Victory fan podcast For Vucks Sake stated that, in their opinion, the 2022-23 A-League Men&#x27;s season was &#x27;the worst in the club&#x27;s history&#x27;.

Victory&#x27;s 2023–24 season was much more successful, finishing third overall on the ladder with 10 wins and 12 draws. After beating Melbourne City in the Elimination Finals on penalties, the team then advanced to the semi-final, beating Wellington Phoenix 2–1 on aggregate, advancing to the Grand Final. With a 3–1 loss to the Central Coast Mariners, Victory finished the season as runners-up.

Following the defeat in the 2024 Grand Final, Popovic was set to accept a pay cut to remain at Melbourne Victory, in light of a contract standoff where Popovic ultimately lost out on the Hajduk Split job he was closely linked to. However, it is rumored he became furious upon discovering John Didulica, who initially lured Popovic to Victory, had been courting the services of Melbourne City legend Patrick Kisnorbo, since May, catalysing his departure from the club.

=== Kisnorbo Era (2024 - Present) ===
Patrick Kisnorbo was officially appointed Melbourne Victory head coach on June 25, 2024, on a 3-year deal until the conclusion of the 2026/27 A-League Men&#x27;s Season.

Melbourne Victory released a number of players prior to the appointment of Kisnorbo, including Salim Khelifi, Chris Ikonomidis, Stefan Nigro, Eli Adams, Ahmad Taleb and former Johnny Warren Medalist and Victory Medalist Jake Brimmer. Dual Victory Medalist Damien Da Silva, Connor Chapman, Roly Bonevacia, Ben Folami and Matt Bozinovski shortly followed. Paul Izzo was signed by Danish side Randers. Leigh Broxham retired.

Victory followed by signing Josh Rawlins, Reno Piscopo, Jack Duncan, Jing Reec, Brendan Hamill and Real Madrid product Nikos Vergos, who is estimated to be earning 600k AUD per year on his 2-year deal. They also secured the signing of Australian international goalkeeper Mitch Langerak, who would join the club in January 2025 once his contract with Nagoya Grampus ended. Alex Menelaou, Daniel Graskoski and Luka Kolic were elevated to the first team.

The Kisnorbo era began with early success, going undefeated in all preseason matches and up to the final of the Australia Cup. Controversially, Kisnorbo completely dropped Daniel Arzani from the squad on the day of the final, stating &quot;it was a selection decision&quot; and not the result of a fallout with the player. However, it is rumoured that Arzani was dropped following a bust-up with Kisnorbo at training. Reportedly, the winger expressed his frustration in front of the whole squad, due to being offered to other clubs in the preseason transfer window. Ultimately, Melbourne Victory suffered a 1–0 loss to Macarthur in the final of the Australia Cup, condemning them to their second major final loss in the same year.

==Colours and badge==
Melbourne Victory&#x27;s colours are navy blue, white and silver, which encompass the traditional state sporting colours of Victoria. The club&#x27;s home kit is traditionally all-navy blue, with a white chevron design. Known colloquially as the &quot;big V&quot;, it is a symbol associated with the Victoria Australian rules football team. The Victory&#x27;s away kits have often featured a reversed colour scheme, with white shirts, shorts and socks, alongside a navy blue chevron. Grey and fluorescent yellow have both featured as away kit colours as well.

Currently, the home kit consists of a navy blue shirt with a chevron which fades from white at the bottom to navy blue at the top, paired with navy blue shorts and socks. The away kit is all white, with the shirt featuring a yoke consisting of a design reminiscent of the club&#x27;s home ground AAMI Park, set inside an off-centre chevron.

A new kit was introduced for the 2008 AFC Champions League due to AFC rules requiring kits to have player numbers on the front of the uniform as well as the back, which would not fit well with the &#x27;V&#x27; on the Victory&#x27;s regular kit. For the 2009–10 season, Melbourne changed their away shirt to be a reverse of their home shirt; white with a blue chevron. In 2010, Melbourne wore the TAC &#x27;seatbelt&#x27; shirt against Perth Glory in a charity event to raise awareness for the necessary use of seat belts in cars. Adidas were announced as the club&#x27;s official kit manufacturer for five years beginning in the 2011–12 season, after the initial deal for Reebok to supply all A-League clubs had expired. The new kits were announced via the club&#x27;s YouTube channel, and featured a controversial change to a fluoro yellow away shirt. For their 2013–14 kits, Melbourne Victory received backlash from supporters, as the away kits featured a much lighter blue, bearing a large resemblance to fierce rivals Sydney FC.

===Sponsorship===
On 5 December 2005, South Korean electronics giant Samsung became the club&#x27;s major sponsor in a two-year deal, giving Samsung logo placement on the front and the back of Victory&#x27;s home and away kits. Prior to the 2006–07 season, KFC were announced as Victory&#x27;s sleeve sponsor, with their logo appearing on the sleeve of Victory&#x27;s home and away kits. On 28 January 2009, Samsung announced that they would not renew their sponsorship for the 2009–10 A-League season. Intralot became the Melbourne Victory&#x27;s new major sponsor when they signed a two-season $2 million contract on 4 May 2009. Their logo subsequently featured on the front of Melbourne Victory&#x27;s playing strip, starting from the 2009–10 season. On 6 August 2010, it was announced that law firm Florin Burhala Lawyers would be Melbourne Victory&#x27;s official shorts sponsor for the 2010–11 season. On 1 June 2011, it was announced that human resources company Adecco Group signed a three-year deal as the club&#x27;s major sponsor, replacing Intralot. As part of the deal, Adecco&#x27;s logo appeared on the front of the club&#x27;s playing strip. Melbourne Victory announced on 16 June 2011 that they had signed a five-year deal with global sportswear giant Adidas as the club&#x27;s official kit manufacturer.

===AFC Competition Sponsorship===
==Club songs==
A number of different songs have become synonymous with Melbourne Victory, being both sung by supporters and played over the PA at different moments before, during and after games.

*&quot;Stand By Me&quot; by Ben E. King. This is sung as the team enters the pitch prior to kick-off, with fans holding their scarves above their heads throughout.
*&quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; by The White Stripes. The chorus melody is chanted as a goal celebration, with fans waving their scarves in the air as they sing. It has also been adapted as a player chant for former striker Besart Berisha.
*&quot;Victory The Brave&quot;, a rearrangement of Scotland The Brave, penned by Jim Keays of The Masters Apprentices, with Glenn Wheatley helping to compose the song. This song is played after every home win.
*&quot;Freed from Desire&quot; by Gala. In January 2022, Melbourne Victory ran a fan poll to choose a post-match victory song to be played after every Melbourne Victory home win; Freed from Desire received the most votes in the post, becoming the post-match victory song of the club, with the song played after the conclusion of Victory the Brave.

==Stadiums==

Melbourne Victory currently plays all of its home games at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium, known as AAMI Park for sponsorship purposes.

===Olympic Park Stadium===
The club was originally based at the 50-year-old Olympic Park Stadium, where they played all home matches during the 2005–06 A-League season. This stadium had seated areas only on the wings, with standing-room sandy terraces on the north and south ends. The average crowd during the first year was 14,158, 77% of its capacity of 18,500. As a result, the match-day atmosphere would prove to be a marketing asset not just for Melbourne Victory, but also for the rest of the league. It also proved to be a major factor in the club&#x27;s decision to relocate home games to Docklands Stadium, then known as &#x27;Telstra Dome&#x27;, from the 2006–07 season onwards, for both safety reasons, and simplicity in membership and match-day attendance expansion. Despite the club permanently relocating to Docklands Stadium, the venue was still used occasionally for both the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons, until being permanently closed in 2009.

===Docklands Stadium===

On 2 September 2006, Melbourne Victory played its first ever match against Sydney FC at the 56,000 capacity Marvel Stadium in a 3–2 victory. The match proved to be a runaway success in terms of crowds, with 39,730 in attendance. As a result, the club moved all but one of their home games to the ground. This move to such a large stadium proved to be an outstanding success, with the Grand Final held there. The average attendance rose to 27,728 for the 2006–07 season, 10,000 above the next highest in the A-League.

During the construction of the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium, Marvel Stadium continued to serve as the club&#x27;s only home ground until the completion of the club&#x27;s new permanent home, which began hosting games from the 2010–11 A-League season. On 11 March 2016, it was announced that th club had committed to a further lease of 10 years for the continued use of limited blockbuster matches at the venue, ending at the conclusion of the 2026–27 season. This agreement was mutually ended in July 2021, when the club announced it would no longer play any further home matches at Docklands Stadium and would play every future home match at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium.

To date, Melbourne Victory have celebrated the 2006–07 and 2008–09 premiership and championship victories at the venue. The stadium was also the permanent venue and operational base of the club during the 2008 Pre-Season Cup, although the grand final was won in Wellington, New Zealand.

===Melbourne Rectangular Stadium===
Prior to the 2006–07 season the club had planned to move to a new $190 million stadium being built to the east of the current Olympic Park complex. The new stadium was originally expected to sit approximately 20,000 spectators (expandable to 25,000) and was to be completed by 2009.

These plans were revised after the Victory refused to commit to playing at such a small capacity stadium. On 23 May 2007, the club announced it had signed as a founding co-tenant of the new stadium, which would now be built to accommodate a maximum of 30,050 spectators with further renovations to 50,000 possible. However, further expansion in the near-term is unlikely as it was discovered during Australia&#x27;s World Cup Bid process that to build such an expansion would be prohibitively expensive.

Today, the venue is the home of the club&#x27;s operations, administration, and the majority of the senior team&#x27;s home matches, as well as occasional home matches of the NYL/NPL &amp; W-League teams. The club currently holds the highest attendance of any association football (soccer) match played at the venue, and second overall for any sporting event at the venue. The record was set in the 2015 A-League Grand Final on 17 May 2015, with an attendance of 29,843 witnessing Melbourne win its third title, and first at the venue in the club&#x27;s history. The venue was also the place of celebration with club celebrating the 2014–15 premiership and the 2015 FFA Cup victories.

===Kardinia Park===

On 22 August 2007, the club played its first competitive match at Kardinia Park, then known as GMHBA Stadium, against Newcastle Jets in the 2007 Pre-Season Cup.

On 15 February 2014, Melbourne Victory was forced to play at the Geelong-based stadium, in playing their Asian Champions League qualifying game against Muangthong United at Simonds Stadium due to AAMI Park and Marvel Stadium being unavailable.

Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Melbourne Victory signed a three-year deal to play one home game a year at the venue for the 2014–15, 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons. In January 2017, the deal was extended to the conclusion of the 2018–19 season.

==Support==
In 2007 Melbourne Victory had the largest supporter base in Australia. Known for their extreme passion and atmosphere, the North End are the largest of the active support groups associated with Victory.

In January 2011, the Victory supporting Horda group was suspected to have stolen a banner from Melbourne Heart&#x27;s Yarraside active group. In the following games, Horda banners were banned, which led to great protest from the Northern Terrace active members.

Fans anger further escalated as they were subjected to a rising police presence at games. In response, on 2 February 2011, the fans from the North Terrace organised a silent protest for the Melbourne Victory – Newcastle Jets match. They left the North Terrace empty, and had a banner saying &quot;No fans no past no future – without us you are nothing NT United&quot;. The banner was later confiscated by the police.

In February 2011, Victoria Police said they were reluctant to cover Melbourne Victory games because of behaviour by fans that they claimed was unacceptable. Problems included violence, anti-social behaviour and the lighting of flares.

On 3 January 2014, Football Federation Australia charged both Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers with bringing the game into disrepute following violent fan behaviour before and during their game on 28 December 2013.

==Rivalries==
*Melbourne City (Melbourne Derby): Melbourne Victory&#x27;s local rival is Melbourne City, which entered the competition in the 2010–11 season (as Melbourne Heart, before the name change in 2014), becoming the 2nd club in Melbourne. The rivalry reached a whole new level when Victory skipper Kevin Muscat was red carded for a tackle on Heart player Adrian Zahra. Currently six former Victory players have switched to Melbourne Heart (City), with Mate Dugandžić doing the first ever direct switch from Victory to City in 2011. Anthony Lesiotis is currently the only play to have ever gone the other way (City to Victory). In the 2020-21 A-League season, City beat Victory 6–0 at Marvel Stadium, then 7–0 in the return leg at AAMI Park, with striker Jamie Maclaren scoring 5 goals in the latter, along with former Victory player Andrew Nabbout scoring the opener. The 40th Melbourne Derby on 17 December 2022 was unprecedented in its volatility, with the match marred with poor crowd behaviour, including multiple flares ignited and thrown onto the pitch by supporters of both teams. In the 20th minute of the match, Melbourne City goalkeeper Tom Glover threw back a flare sent from the crowd, sparking a pitch invasion which saw both Glover and referee Alex King assaulted by pitch invaders, and causing the match to be abandoned. In response Football Australia implemented interim sanctions closing active supporter bays for both clubs for all matches up to and including 15 January 2023.
*Sydney FC (The Big Blue): Sydney is considered Melbourne&#x27;s major interstate rival, due to Melbourne and Sydney being Australia&#x27;s two largest cities (see Melbourne-Sydney rivalry). Matches between the two teams are regularly the league&#x27;s most spiteful encounters with narratives spanning from the inception of the A-League itself. Supporters from both sides cite each other as their most hated and competitive rivals due to the extensive history of the fixture while also acknowledging both their positions as the biggest teams in the league. The rivalry between the two teams first intensified beyond being just an interstate feud after Sydney beat Melbourne in the final match of the 2009–10 season to claim the A-League Premiership over the Victory by a single point. This was followed up with another Sydney triumph in the 2010 A-League Grand Final where the Sky Blues became the first team to win the league&#x27;s Championship as the away team. However, in season 2014/15, Victory reversed these defeats, by first pipping Sydney to the A-League Premiership during the league season and weeks later beat them in the 2015 A-League Grand Final. In the 2016/17 grand final, Melbourne Victory succumbed to a 4–2 penalty shootout defeat to Sydney FC (losing to Sydney in a penalty shootout for the second time). Victory avenged that loss on 28 April 2018 in a semifinal encounter with their old rivals with a 117th minute extra time strike from Terry Antonis to win 3–2 on the night. Melbourne would meet Sydney in the following season again in the A-League semifinals where a rampant Sydney would deliver a devastating 6-1 humbling, marking the end of Victory club legend, Kevin Muscat&#x27;s, managerial tenure.
*Adelaide United (The Original Derby / The Original Rivalry): Melbourne Victory also has a rivalry with Adelaide United. This rivalry stems from the other football codes, where the interstate rivalry is big between Victorians and South Australians (see South Australia-Victoria rivalry). There have also been altercations between sets of opposing fans in Melbourne and Adelaide. The rivalry has built up from previous encounters, when an incident between the then Adelaide United manager, John Kosmina, and Victory skipper Kevin Muscat took place during a sideline altercation during a match in the 2006–07 season, and when Victory striker Ney Fabiano spat in the direction of Adelaide defender Robert Cornthwaite during Round 4 in the 2008–09 season. Fabiano was banned for nine matches; but this was reduced to six after a successful appeal. Victory and Adelaide contested both the 2006–07 and 2008–09 Grand Finals, with Melbourne winning both.
*Western United (The Westgate Derby / The Battle of the Bridge): Melbourne Victory has developed a rivalry with Western United, which entered the competition in the 2019–20 season, becoming the 3rd club in Melbourne. Despite the rivalry&#x27;s short existence, it has garnered a reputation for producing talking points, controversy, tension, goals and drama. In the team&#x27;s first meeting, in November 2019 at Marvel Stadium, Western United won 3-2 despite going 2–0 down within the first 7 minutes. In February 2021 at Marvel Stadium, despite conceding the first goal of the match and despite being reduced to 10 men for the final half-hour of the match, Western United won 4–3, with Victor Sanchez scoring in the final minute of stoppage time. For the first 5 meetings between the two teams, Western United had 4 wins and a draw. On 28 May 2021, Melbourne Victory ended their losing run against Western United in emphatic fashion, winning 6–1 at AAMI Park. Currently six former Victory players have played for Western United (four have played for the Victory senior team, two have represented the Victory&#x27;s youth or NPL teams without making an appearance for the senior team).

==Corporate==
Melbourne Victory Football Club has been and is currently owned by unlisted public company &#x27;Melbourne Victory Ltd&#x27;, since its inception. 
Ownership of the holding company consists of many minor shareholders from the city of Melbourne, with shareholders consisting of Premier Fresh Australia chief executive Anthony Di Pietro, owners of Metricon and U.S. Triestina the Biasin family, and Miami based private investment firm 777 partners. Despite the diverse shareholding by local families from Melbourne to Venture Capitalists, the club is not a &quot;for profit&quot; business, and as such the shareholders have never taken a dividend.

Prior to the establishment of the A-League Men, the newly established club struggled to raise the initial $5 million equity capital to join the League in its first season, resulting in Football Australia contributing approximately $500,000 to secure the club&#x27;s position in the league, with the eventual intention to sell its stake. As a result, the federation took a ten per cent holding in the club in return, as well as having a representative on the Victory board. From humble beginnings, the club has become a commercial success, with the club&#x27;s value increasing from $19.2m in November 2014 to $40m in 2018, with the most recent evaluation being $50m following the partial purchase of the club by 777 Partners.

<text>Zurracapote (sometimes abbreviated as zurra) is a popular Spanish alcoholic mixed drink, similar to sangría. It consists of red wine mixed with fruit such as peaches and lemons, sugar, and cinnamon. The concoction is then traditionally left to steep for several days, though some recipes call for the addition of other alcoholic beverages, juices, and fruit extracts. The result is a mild-to-medium alcoholic drink, similar to sangría.

The drink is normally prepared in large receptacles during local festivals with many local variations in recipe. It was first drunk in Calahorra, where &quot;Peña Phillips&quot; developed the recipe through several competitions. It is the typical drink of the La Rioja area and nearby areas such as northern Burgos, Soria, Ribera Navarra, and the Basque Country. It is also prepared in other Spanish provinces, such as Albacete, northern Granada, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, and Guadalajara.

<doc id="1257177" wikidata="Q762294" url="?curid=1257177" title="Central Coast Mariners FC">
<text>Central Coast Mariners Football Club is an Australian professional soccer club based in Gosford, on the Central Coast of New South Wales. It competes in the A-League Men, under licence from the Australian Professional Leagues (APL).

The Mariners were founded in 2004 and are one of the eight original A-League teams. It is the first professional sports club from the Gosford region to compete in a national competition. Despite being one of the smallest clubs in the league, the Central Coast Mariners have claimed three A-League Championships from six Grand Final appearances and topped the table to win the A-League Premiership three times. The club has also appeared in the AFC Champions League five times and won the AFC Cup once.

The club plays matches at Central Coast Stadium, a 20,059-seat stadium in Gosford; its purpose-built training facility, Mariners Centre of Excellence, is located in the suburb of Tuggerah. The facility is also home to a youth team that competes in the A-League Youth. The Mariners&#x27; main supporters&#x27; group is known as the Yellow Army, for the colour of the club&#x27;s home kit. The club shares a rivalry with Newcastle Jets, known as the F3 Derby, after the previous name of the highway that connects the cities of the teams. Matt Simon is the Mariners&#x27; all-time leading goalscorer as of May 2022, with 66 goals in all competitions. The team record for matches played is held by John Hutchinson, who has appeared in 263 games for the Mariners.

==History==

===Formation (2004)===
Central Coast Mariners&#x27; bid for a franchise in the Football Federation Australia&#x27;s new A-League competition was aimed at filling the one spot for a regional team that was designated by the FFA. Media speculation prior to the announcement of the franchises in the new league suggested that the Mariners&#x27; bid may be favourable due to its new blood. Backing from former Australian international player and club technical director Alex Tobin, as well as Clean Up Australia personality Ian Kiernan—who would act as inaugural club chairman—also strengthened its proposal. As the only regional bidder, Central Coast was expected to make it into the league by default. Following a reported signed deal with the FFA, the club signed former Northern Spirit coach Lawrie McKinna as manager and Ian Ferguson, a former Rangers and Northern Spirit player, as coach. To aid the FFA&#x27;s goals of building the profile of the sport, the Mariners created formal links with local state league team Central Coast United. On 1 November 2004, after much expectation, the club was announced as one of eight teams to become part of FFA&#x27;s domestic competition, the A-League. The decision made Central Coast Mariners the first Gosford-based professional sports team to play in a national competition.

At the time of the formation of the new league in 2004, the club was owned by Spirits Sports and Leisure Group. The club announced its search for a star player under the league&#x27;s allowance for one star player outside of the $1.5 million salary cap, insisting that the player should not look at the position as a retirement fund. Coach Lawrie McKinna sought interest from Australia national football team players Ante Milicic and Simon Colosimo, and announced that he may sign more than the three under-20 players required by league rules. Early concerns for the club focussed on concerns over financial stability, but after forming a partnership with technology company Toshiba and a cash injection from local businessman John Singleton, the club&#x27;s financial worries were eased. McKinna was keen to sign local player Damien Brown of Bateau Bay, formerly of the Newcastle Jets. In a decision which prompted the player to declare that he was &quot;over the moon&quot;, Brown became the first player to sign with the club. Club chairman Lyall Gorman was pleased that a local had become a &quot;foundation player&quot; and part of Brown&#x27;s role would be to assist with selection of younger players from the local area. By early December 2004, the club had created a steady foundation of player signings and began negotiations with former Perth Glory striker Nik Mrdja, signing him later in the month as its star attacker. Mrjda was one of the most prominent players in the last season of the National Soccer League, scoring the final goal to secure Perth Glory&#x27;s finals win. The club&#x27;s management was reluctant to sign a star player outside of the $1.5 million salary cap, stipulating that they &quot;would have to contribute on the pitch and get people to come to the ground.&quot;

===Lawrie McKinna era (2004–2010)===

The Mariners&#x27; inaugural season was considered a resounding success by most; the team reached the 2006 A-League Grand Final after finishing third during the regular season. Central Coast was defeated by Sydney FC 1–0 in front of a crowd of 41,689—a competition record at the time. The Mariners also won the 2005 Pre-Season Cup, defeating Perth Glory in the final 1–0. Before the 2006–07 A-League season, the Mariners secured the services of then-Australian international Tony Vidmar from NAC Breda for two years. This was the club&#x27;s first marquee signing, following the lead of Sydney FC (Dwight Yorke) and Adelaide United (Qu Shengqing). Central Coast again reached the grand final in the 2006 Pre-Season Cup, losing to Adelaide United 5–4 on penalties after the score was tied 1–1 after extra time. The Mariners then participated in the 2006–07 A-League season, but was unable to gain a spot in the final series, finishing sixth after the regular season.

Club captain Noel Spencer was released by the Mariners, then signed to participate in the Asian Champions League by Sydney FC after the 2006–07 season, and Alex Wilkinson was appointed the new captain. Only 22 years of age at the time, Wilkinson had played every possible competitive match for the Mariners up to his appointment. In February 2008, Central Coast Mariners signed an arrangement with English Football League Championship side Sheffield United. The partnership was one of several connections the Mariners made with foreign clubs; other partner clubs included Ferencváros of Hungary, Chengdu Blades of China and São Paulo of Brazil. The agreement benefits the club by providing an opportunity for the youth programme and senior side to draw from the roster of Sheffield United through transfers. The teams also formed a property development joint venture, in the hopes that Central Coast could use its share of income to expand and bolster their Mariners Youth Academy.

The 2007–08 season saw Central Coast win its first premiership on goal difference ahead of Newcastle, following a final round that began with Central Coast and three other clubs level on 31 points. The final series began with a 2–0 loss to Newcastle in the first leg of its major semi-final, but the Mariners forced the tie to extra time by holding a 2–0 lead in the second leg after 90 minutes. A 94th-minute goal by Sasho Petrovski, who had scored earlier to level the tie, gave Central Coast a 3–2 win on aggregate, putting the Mariners through to the 2008 A-League Grand Final. In a rematch with Newcastle, the Jets defeated Central Coast 1–0 in the Grand Final, which ended in controversy due to an uncalled handball against Newcastle in Central Coast Mariners penalty box during the closing seconds of the match. If called, the foul would have given Central Coast a penalty kick and a chance to equalise. As Mariners players disputed referee Mark Shield&#x27;s decision, goalkeeper Danny Vuković struck Shield on the arm, resulting in an immediate sending off and later suspension. Vuković was suspended from both domestic and international competition for nine months, with an additional six-months&#x27; suspended ban; the latter period was reduced to three months on appeal. Despite further appeals, the ban was eventually confirmed by FIFA in June, to include banning the young keeper from competing at the 2008 Olympic Games. The ban lasted into October; in response, Central Coast signed former Manchester United and Australian international keeper Mark Bosnich on a seven-week contract.

Before the 2008–09 season, Central Coast was predicted to be among the A-League leaders, but had a run of three losses in a row to end the regular season. Even with the losing streak, the club narrowly qualified for the finals, finishing in fourth, two points ahead of Sydney F.C. and Wellington Phoenix. Central Coast lost 4–1 on aggregate in their minor semi-final against Queensland Roar, ending the team&#x27;s season.

===Graham Arnold and Phil Moss era (2010–2015)===
In February 2010, following the club&#x27;s 2009–10 season, McKinna chose to move into a new role, becoming Central Coast&#x27;s Football and Commercial Operations Manager. Socceroos assistant manager Graham Arnold was appointed as the club&#x27;s new manager, becoming its second manager. In the lead-up to the 2010–11 season, numerous transfers resulted in changes to the club&#x27;s squad. The Mariners announced the signing of 2005 Under 20s World Cup winner Patricio Pérez of Argentina in June 2010, followed by Dutch defender Patrick Zwaanswijk. In July 2010, it was announced that the Mariners&#x27; women&#x27;s team would not compete in the 2010–11 W-League competition. The club stated that financial reasons were behind the decision, after Football NSW withdrew its funding.

In spite of relatively low expectations in the lead up to the season, the 2010–11 season was more successful for the club than 2009–10; the A-League and youth league teams both finished second in their respective leagues in the regular season. The senior team was then defeated by the premiers, Brisbane Roar, 4–2 on aggregate over two legs in the major semi-final, before defeating Gold Coast United 1–0 in the Preliminary Final to qualify for the 2011 A-League Grand Final against Brisbane. By reaching the Grand Final, the club also qualified for the 2012 AFC Champions League. In a championship match that the A-League&#x27;s website called &quot;classic&quot;, Central Coast was defeated 4–2 in a penalty shootout after leading 2–0 with three minutes remaining in extra time to finish runners-up for the third time.

The 2011–12 season was similarly successful, as the club won the premiership for the second time in its history with 51 points, two more than second-place Brisbane. The club failed to qualify for a second successive Grand Final, though, losing 5–2 on aggregate to Brisbane in the major semi-final and 5–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw with Perth Glory in the Grand Final Qualifier.

On 21 April 2013, after three losses in Grand Finals, Central Coast won its first A-League title, defeating first-year side Western Sydney Wanderers 2–0 in the Grand Final at Allianz Stadium. Arnold re-signed with the club for a further two seasons on 30 August 2013, but on 14 November it was confirmed that he had signed a two-year contract to become manager of J. League Division 1 side Vegalta Sendai, starting in January 2014. Former assistant manager Phil Moss was named the new head coach. Mariners general manager Peter Turnbull left the club as well, and New Zealand international Michael McGlinchey moved to the J. League to play for Arnold&#x27;s new side. Central Coast finished the 2013–14 A-League regular season in third place, behind runner-up Western Sydney on goal difference. In the semi-final, the Mariners&#x27; championship hopes ended with a 2–0 loss to Western Sydney; the game came three days after the team was eliminated from the 2014 AFC Champions League after losing to Japanese club Sanfrecce Hiroshima 1–0 to finish last in their group.

In what was Moss&#x27;s first pre-season as coach, he did little to change what Arnold had built at the club. The only major changes in the side were with the addition of Senegalese international Malick Mané and Hungarian Richárd Vernes, and Marcos Flores leaving the club, with Mile Sterjovski retiring. Mariners began the season on a high, progressing to the semi-finals of the 2014 FFA Cup and defeating local rivals Newcastle Jets 1–0 at home in the opening round of the A-League. However the season soon turned with the team failing to secure a win for the remainder of the year. After their elimination from the 2015 AFC Champions League qualifying play-off by Chinese side Guangzhou R&amp;F and a continued poor league record after a short mid-season break, the club stood down Moss as head coach. The decision was made on 6 March 2015, with Mariners appointing technical director Tony Walmsley in an interim capacity and captain John Hutchinson in a dual player-coach role, until the end of the season. Portuguese player Fábio Ferreira also joined the team at the tail end of the season. On 15 April Walmsley was announced as Central Coast&#x27;s permanent technical director and head coach for the 2015–16 season. The announcement came despite an end to the season in which the club finished the league in eighth position.

===Post-Arnold era (2015–2020)===
Central Coast had their equal-worst A-League performance to date in the 2015–16 season. Their 13 points, the fewest in club history, resulted in a last-place finish, and they set a league record by losing 20 games while winning only 3, a record low for the Mariners. Central Coast allowed 70 goals, the most in league history, and had a goal difference of −37, the worst by an A-League team. The Mariners&#x27; totals of goals conceded at home and away (32 and 38 respectively) were also A-League records, and they went the entire season without a clean sheet.

In the 2016 FFA Cup, Central Coast suffered a 2–1 loss to Green Gully SC at Green Gully Reserve, becoming just the second A-League team to be eliminated by a state league team in the FFA Cup. Following this loss the club sacked Walmsley on 8 August 2016, with coaching duties in the leadup to the 2016–17 season taken up by assistant coach John Hutchinson in a caretaker role.

On 29 August 2016, Paul Okon was hired as Central Coast&#x27;s full-time coach, succeeding the sacked Tony Walmsley. In Okon&#x27;s debut as Central Coast manager, the Mariners drew 3–3 with Perth Glory at Nib Stadium, after coming back from 3–0 down at half time. Okon achieved his first win as Central Coast manager in his fifth game in charge: a 2–1 win over defending champions Adelaide United at Hindmarsh Stadium on 6 November 2016. However, the Mariners ended the season in eighth.

On 2 August 2017, for the second consecutive year, the Mariners were knocked out of the FFA Cup by a state league team in the first round, after losing 3–2 to Blacktown City. During the 2017–18 A-League season, the Mariners were in the top four at one stage, but after a run of 11 games without a win the club dropped down the table. Okon resigned as manager with Central Coast in ninth entering the last four rounds of the regular season; Wayne O&#x27;Sullivan served as an interim manager following Okon&#x27;s departure. With a six-game losing streak at the end of the season, the team finished last for the second time in three years. Former Brisbane manager Mike Mulvey was hired by Central Coast in 2018. In the first 21 matches of the 2018–19 A-League season, the Mariners won only once. Mulvey was replaced as manager by Alen Stajcic, the former head coach of the Australia women&#x27;s national team. Despite two wins in his six games as a caretaker manager, the Mariners were unable to avoid finishing at the bottom of the table again. Stajcic was given a three-year contract after the season.

On 4 August 2020, after playing their last game of the 2019–20 season, the Mariners were put up for sale by owner Michael Charlesworth, putting the club at risk of leaving the Central Coast. If no buyer is found, the Mariners&#x27; A-League license will be handed back to the FFA.

===Resurgence (2020–present)===
In his second full season at the club, in 2020–21, Stajcic made some large signings, re-acquiring the services of former player Oliver Bozanic and signing Costa Rican international Marco Urena. The season had begun well with the Mariners beating local rivals Sydney FC in Sydney for the first time in seven years. The Mariners sat in first place after 16 rounds, but would drop points during the later rounds to finish in third place. This qualified the club for their first finals appearance in seven years. They would then lose to Macarthur FC 2–0 in the elimination finals on 12 June 2021.

Stajcic resigned ahead of the 2021–22 season the club, and was replaced by Nick Montgomery. Montgomery&#x27;s first season continued on the success of previous one. He brought the club to its first ever FFA Cup final where they lost 2–1 to Melbourne Victory on 5 February 2022. The Mariners also finished fifth in the A-League which qualified the club for a second consecutive finals series. They were again knocked out in the elimination finals, this time by Adelaide United, losing 3–1 on 15 May 2022.

On 3 June 2023, Central Coast played against Melbourne City in the 2023 A-League Men Grand Final. The Mariners defeated Melbourne City 6–1 to win their second A-League Championship, and their first in a decade, with Jason Cummings winning the Joe Marston Medal for best on ground.

Ahead of the new season, Championship winning coach Nick Montgomery departed the club to become the head coach of Hibernian, and was replaced by former MK Dons coach Mark Jackson for the title defence. The 2023-24 season saw further success for the club, winning the A-League Premiership for finishing top of the table in the regular season, their first continental title after defeating Al Ahed in the 2024 AFC Cup final, and qualification for the upcoming A-League Finals Series. The Mariners would go on to beat Melbourne Victory 3–1 in extra time in the 2024 A-League Men Grand Final. This Achievement would mean that they had won the treble.

==== 2023–24 AFC Cup champions ====
Central Coast returned to the continental tournament after 9 years since their 2015 AFC Champions League appearance and also making their debut in the AFC Cup. The Mariners were drawn in Group G alongside Malaysian side Terengganu, Indonesian side Bali United and Philippines side Stallion Laguna. On 20 September 2023, Central Coast played their debut match in a 1–0 away lost against Terengganu. In the next match on 4 October, the Mariners recorded their highest ever continental win thrashing Stallion Laguna to a whopping 9–1 victory. Central Coast went on to top the group as leaders with 13 points in which they qualified to the knockout stage. In the knockout stage which is also known as the zonal semi-finals, the Mariners faced Cambodian side Phnom Penh Crown on 13 February 2024, Central Coast went on to win the match 4–0 with Ryan Edmondson scoring a hat-trick to secure the club advancing to the zonal finals facing against Macarthur FC on 22 February, Central Coast went on to win the match in a narrow 3–2 win in extra time thus qualifying to the Inter-zone play-off semi-finals facing off Indian side Odisha winning them 4–0 on aggregate and advanced to the Inter-zone play-off finals facing off against Kyrgyzstani side Abdysh-Ata Kant where the Mariners won 4–1 on aggregate thus qualified to the 2024 AFC Cup final facing against Lebanese side Al Ahed. On 5 May, Central Coast played their final match at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex in Oman where in the 84th minute, super sub Alou Kuol scored the only goal in the match to win the AFC Cup for Central Coast.

==Colours and badge==
The home jersey worn by the Mariners is mostly yellow with sleeves that are navy blue. The away uniform is a mostly plain navy blue jersey with yellow as a secondary colour. In the 2011–12 season, the club had its kits manufactured by Hummel, as the A-League&#x27;s Reebok deal had expired at the conclusion of the 2010–11 season. In September 2012, it was announced that the Mariners had signed a two-year deal with Kappa for them to be the official apparel supplier. The team logo is a yellow football at the centre of a blue curling wave, which symbolises the beaches of the Central Coast.

Since 2012, the Mariners have worn special pink kits for one match in October to raise money and awareness for Pink Ribbon Day, part of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The Mariners club collected donations at the ground, as well as auctioning the match-worn kits on online auction site eBay with proceeds going to the charity.

==Stadium==
Central Coast Mariners plays home games at Central Coast Stadium, Gosford. It is located in Grahame Park, between the Gosford Central Business District and the Brisbane Water foreshore. It is constructed to make the most of its location, being open at the southern end, giving filtered views of Brisbane Water through a row of large palm trees. It is within walking distance of Gosford railway station and is adjacent to the Central Coast Leagues Club.

The stadium has a capacity of 20,059, and the highest attendance for a Mariners game was a sold-out 21,379 in the 2024 Grand Final, assisted with portable seating at the southern end of the ground. Difficulties in drawing spectators led the Mariners to schedule matches in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons away from Central Coast Stadium, at North Sydney Oval and Brookvale Oval. The club&#x27;s goal was to play closer to its fan base in north Sydney, which majority owner Michael Charlesworth estimated to be about 20% of its total supporters. Following attendances at North Sydney Oval that were similar to those at Central Coast Stadium, Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop suggested in December 2014 that it would be unlikely that the club would be permitted to continue playing in north Sydney.

==Supporters and rivalries==

The active supporters&#x27; group for the Mariners is called the Yellow Army, who sit in bay 16 of Central Coast Stadium during home games. In addition to the Yellow Army, there is a Central Coast Mariners Official Supporters Club, which was established during 2013. The Central Coast region has about 300,000 residents, which gives the Mariners the A-League&#x27;s smallest local fan base. Accordingly, the Mariners acquired a small-market image among commentators.

The Mariners developed a strong rivalry with Newcastle Jets throughout their first season, often referred to as the F3 Derby. The naming is a title previously used for the Sydney–Newcastle Freeway, the major motorway which joins the two clubs&#x27; cities. The rivalry&#x27;s origins date back to before the teams played against each other in the A-League. A May 2005 Oceania Club Championship qualification match, which went to a penalty shootout that the Mariners won, helped create hostility between the sides. In the game, a tackle by Central Coast&#x27;s Mrdja broke one of Newcastle player Andrew Durante&#x27;s legs, causing him to miss the following A-League season; Mrdja offered no apology for the tackle, upsetting Jets players. Fans of the clubs battled verbally before and after one 2011 derby match, leading the &quot;Newcastle Herald&quot;&#x27;s Josh Leeson to call their actions &quot;immature and laughable.&quot; In more recent seasons, the F3 Derby has gained less attention in the press than the derbies in Melbourne and Sydney, but Central Coast player Nicholas Fitzgerald maintains that &quot;the players and fans still take it very seriously.&quot;

Central Coast also have a rivalry with Sydney FC. Like Newcastle, Sydney FC is close in proximity to Central Coast. In 2006, the &quot;Central Coast Express Advocate&quot;&#x27;s Richard Noone called the Central Coast–Sydney rivalry &quot;Arguably A-League&#x27;s fiercest&quot;.

This was the second highest crowd at the ground for any sport since the first match at Central Coast Stadium in February 2000. This record attendance at Central Coast stadium was broken during the 2022–23 season for the second leg of the A-league semi-final against Adelaide United FC. The Mariners won 2–0 (4–1 on aggregate) in front of a sell-out crowd of 20,059 people. The attendance record was further broken at the 2024 Grand Final, where 21,379 attended the game, ending in a 3–1 win for the Mariners after extra time.

<text>Apollonius Molon or Molo of Rhodes (or simply Molon; ), was a Greek rhetorician. He was a native of Alabanda, a pupil of Menecles, and settled at Rhodes, where he opened a school of rhetoric. Prior to that, he twice visited Rome as an ambassador from Rhodes. Marcus Tullius Cicero studied with him during his trip to Greece in 79–77 BC, as did Gaius Julius Caesar a few years later. Perhaps it is at least partially due to Apollonius Molon&#x27;s instruction that Caesar, and Cicero especially, achieved fame as orators in the Roman Republic. Molon is reputed to have quoted Demosthenes in telling his pupils that the first three elements in rhetoric were &quot;Delivery, Delivery and Delivery.&quot; He had a stellar reputation in Roman Law courts, and was even invited to address the Roman Senate in Greek – an honor not usually bestowed upon foreign ambassadors.

Molon wrote on Homer and endeavored to moderate the florid Asiatic style of rhetoric. According to Josephus, in &quot;Against Apion&quot;, Apollonius Molon slandered the Jews.

<doc id="1257184" wikidata="Q354059" url="?curid=1257184" title="Adelaide United FC">
<text>Adelaide United Football Club is a professional men&#x27;s soccer club located in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. The club was one of the eight founding members of the A-League Men and have competed in it concurrently since its formation, under licence from the Australian Professional Leagues.

Established in 2003, the club was formed to replace Adelaide City and West Adelaide in the final season of the National Soccer League, and has remained the only professional club from South Australia. Adelaide United&#x27;s home ground is at Coopers Stadium in the inner north-western suburb of Hindmarsh. Adelaide United won their first silverware in 2006, when they became premiers of the inaugural A-League season, finishing top of the ladder over Sydney FC by seven points. In 2008, the club became the first Australian side to reach the final of the AFC Champions League, being defeated by Gamba Osaka 0–5 across two legs and finishing in fifth place in the 2008 Club World Cup. The club won the first edition of the FFA Cup in 2014 with a 1–0 win at home over Perth Glory. Their first A-League title would come in 2016, defeating Western Sydney Wanderers 3–1 at Adelaide Oval in front of 50,119 spectators, the largest home crowd the club has played a competitive match in front of. Adelaide would become the first club to win back-to-back FFA Cups, defeating Sydney FC 2–1 in 2018 and Melbourne City 4–1 in 2019. The club remains the most successful team to ever play in the competition.

Adelaide United has a rivalry with Melbourne Victory, stemming from numerous altercations between players and coaches, as well as the two clubs&#x27; competitiveness in the early seasons of the A-League, culminating with Grand Final clashes in 2007 and 2009, both of which went the way of Victory. Adelaide United formerly held the record for the largest winning margin in an A-League Men match, having defeated North Queensland Fury 8–1 at home on 21 January 2011. The game was also the first and only instance where two players from the same team, Marcos Flores and Sergio van Dijk, achieved hat-tricks in a single match. They later matched their own record when they beat Newcastle Jets 7–0 at home almost exactly four years later.

In recent years, Adelaide United has grown a reputation of developing young players and selling them to overseas clubs. Notable examples include Nestory Irankunda&#x27;s sale to Bayern Munich for a league record fee, Joe Gauci being bought by Aston Villa, Steven Hall joining Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Riley McGree signing for Club Brugge, all on transfer fees, as well as facilitating moves overseas for Louis D&#x27;Arrigo and Mohamed Toure. According to the International Centre for Sports Studies, the club ranks 43rd in the world and second in the AFC for minutes given to under-21 players.

==History==

===2003–2005: Beginnings===
In August 2003, Adelaide City withdrew from the National Soccer League (NSL), leaving Adelaide with no NSL presence for the first time since the league&#x27;s inception in 1977. West Adelaide had previously withdrawn from the NSL in 1999. In response, Adelaide United was created on 12 September 2003, with real estate businessman Gordon Pickard funding the new club and former Soccer Australia and FIFA executive Basil Scarsella as chairman.

On 13 September, former Brisbane Strikers and Newcastle Breakers manager John Kosmina was officially announced as the manager. Within a few weeks, a team was assembled, mostly with the remnants of the Adelaide City squad to compete in the clubs inaugural season. On 17 October 2003, Adelaide United won its first NSL match against Brisbane Strikers, with a score of 1–0.

After a successfulhome-and-away season, including an unbeaten seven-match streak during November and December 2003, Adelaide United reached the NSL preliminary final, ultimately losing to Perth Glory. The NSL concluded at the end of the 2003–04 season after 28 seasons, with The Reds only participating in the final season. The governing body, Australian Soccer Association (later Football Federation Australia), shut down the league in preparation for the launch of the fully professional A-League almost 12 months later, on 26 August 2005.

===2005–2010: Early days in the A league===
Adelaide United was announced as one of eight teams to compete in the first season of the A-League, and along with the Perth Glory and Newcastle Jets, one of only three teams to survive from the National Soccer League&#x27;s last season. United began preparation earlier than most of the other clubs and had announced two-thirds of the 20-man squad before February 2005.

The club focused on bringing several Adelaide-born players back to South Australia, such as Angelo Costanzo, Travis Dodd, and Lucas Pantelis, who had previously played for Adelaide City SC in the NSL. Shengqing Qu was signed by Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua as the club&#x27;s &quot;marquee&quot; signing (a ruling allowing each club to pay one player outside the salary cap) in March 2005.

Aurelio Vidmar announced his retirement before the A-League had even started. He was replaced before the fifth round by striker Fernando from Brazil, a former &#x27;player of the year&#x27; in the old NSL. By moving to Adelaide, he was reunited with former coach John Kosmina who introduced him to Australian audiences at the Brisbane Strikers.

Adelaide United Director Mel Patzwald established links with American club Miami FC, setting up a &#x27;sister club&#x27; relationship—the first of its kind for an A-League club—with whom they played a number of friendlies and leading to the signings of several players. The club signed Diego Walsh and later Brazilian legend Romário for a five-game guest stint in November/December 2006. Cassio then signed with Adelaide and the club won the 2008 AFC Champions League and played in the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup, where they finished fifth. A sister club relationship with Shandong Luneng was established, as well as part of the state government&#x27;s ties with Shandong Province. Adelaide&#x27;s youth team was invited to participate in the Weifang Cup as a result of the relationship.

Adelaide United finished as premiers in the inaugural season of the Hyundai A-League. However they lost to Sydney FC in the two-leg semi-final and then Central Coast Mariners 1–0 in the preliminary final at Hindmarsh.

Adelaide United started the season well by winning the A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup, beating reigning champions Central Coast Mariners 5–4 on penalties after 1–1 at the end of extra time. In the premiership season, they finished runners-up to Melbourne Victory. After a successful finals campaign, they advanced to the 2006–07 Grand Final, after winning 4–3 on penalties (1–1 AET) against the Newcastle Jets. Adelaide United played Melbourne Victory at the Telstra Dome in the Grand Final on 18 February 2007 losing 6–0. Coach John Kosmina was sacked the following wee owing to the poor performance at the grand final as well as for alleged abuse of two Channel 10 reporters.

The 2006–07 season also saw Brazilian international player Romário join the club for a four-game guest player stint.

Adelaide United was selected, along with Sydney FC, as the first Australian representative to play in the 2007 AFC Champions League. They received their Asian berth as A-League premiers. Adelaide was drawn into Group G with Chinese champion Shandong Luneng Taishan, Korean champions Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma and Vietnamese league and Super Cup champions Gach Dong Tam Long An. Adelaide finished 3rd in its group.

The Reds launched into the season by winning the A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup, beating Perth Glory 2–1 at Hindmarsh Stadium. The club finished 6th place in the A-League, missing out on a final place as they concentrated their energies on maintaining a successful AFC Champions League campaign.

Adelaide United participated in the 2008 AFC Champions League after finishing runner-up in the 2006–07 regular season and finals series to Melbourne Victory. Adelaide was drawn into Group E, along with V-League and Super Cup winners Bình Dương, CSL champions Changchun Yatai, and K-League winners Pohang Steelers.

Adelaide became the first Australian team to progress to the semi-finals of the AFC Champions League. Adelaide drew 2007 Uzbek League Runners-up Bunyodkor in the semi-final after the Uzbeks knocked out Saipa in their quarter-final. In the first leg of the semi-final, Adelaide won 3–0 with Diego, Barbiero, and Cristiano scoring (via a penalty). The match was witnessed by 16,998 fans at Hindmarsh Stadium. In the second leg of the semi-finals, Adelaide United lost 1–0 to FC Bunyodkor but went through to the final 3–1 on aggregate.

In the two-legged final, they took on Japanese team Gamba Osaka who deposed 2007 champions Urawa Red Diamonds in the other semi-final. Adelaide lost heavily over two legs to Gamba Osaka. The score was 3–0 to Gamba Osaka away and 2–0 to Osaka at home in Adelaide, the Japanese club winning 5–0 on aggregate.

This result ensured that Adelaide would participate in the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup either as the AFC representative or as the highest-placed non-Japanese team – as the rules do not allow more than one Japanese team to participate.

The off-season saw the departure of Socceroo Bruce Djite and Nathan Burns. By the end of round 27, Adelaide had drawn level for first, equalling Melbourne&#x27;s 38 points on the ladder. Needing to win 2–0 against the Central Coast Mariners away to win the premiership, The Reds only managed to secure a 1–0 win. Adelaide was pushed down to second because of the goal difference. The Reds, along with Melbourne Victory, Queensland Roar, and Central Coast Mariners, proceeded to the finals. In the Grand Final at Etihad Stadium in Melbourne, Adelaide United lost 1–0 to Melbourne Victory. The match was marred by the controversial 10th-minute sending off of Cristiano which ultimately contributed to the loss.

An early highlight for the season was Adelaide&#x27;s run to the final of the AFC Champions League against Gamba Osaka. Gamba Osaka entered the FIFA Club World Cup as the winner of the AFC Champion&#x27;s League, freeing up the tournament&#x27;s Japanese host position; Adelaide United, as runners-up of the AFC Champion&#x27;s League, filled this position. Their first match was a play-off against 2007–08 OFC Champions League champions Waitakere United from New Zealand. The Reds defeated Waitakere 2–1 via two set plays from Paul Reid to secure a rematch with ACL rivals Gamba Osaka on 14 December – the third meeting between the two sides in three weeks. The Reds fought valiantly and created many opportunities, in particular Travis Dodd, but lost 0–1 after a 23rd minute shot by Gamba midfielder, Yasuhito Endō. On 18 December, Adelaide played in the fifth-place play-off match against Egyptian club Al Ahly SC, defeating them 1–0 to be rewarded the fifth-place prize of US$1.5 million. Adelaide United were awarded the Fair Play award upon the completion of the tournament, and Cristiano&#x27;s goal in the fifth-place play-off was selected as goal of the tournament.
After a stellar season in the A-League and internationally, Adelaide United began its pre-season without a financial owner; Nick Bianco relinquished his A-League license back to Football Federation Australia (FFA). Regardless of this situation, the FFA ensured that Adelaide would have the funds available to recruit in the off-season and to maintain the club, whilst they would negotiate the new ownership deals. This, however, was still not enough to lift the club up from its 2009–10 wooden spoon status – the club&#x27;s worst performing season in its short history.

Adelaide competed in the ACL Champions League in 2010 after finishing second on the 2008–09 A-League league table, and runner-up in the Finals series to cross-border rivals, Melbourne Victory. Adelaide were drawn into Group H alongside 2009 Asian Champions Pohang Steelers, Chinese sister club Shandong Luneng and Sanfrecce Hiroshima. Adelaide United managed to hold on to the top spot of Group H, resulting in a home match in Round 16. In an exciting, nerve-racking match, Adelaide lost to Jeonbuk Motors 3–2. Adelaide came back twice in the game, including a goal in the final seconds of the match. Jeonbuk won the match with a goal in the second half of extra time.

===2010–2018: Bottom to top and first A League championship===
For the first time in the club&#x27;s history, Adelaide United was led by an international manager in Rini Coolen, moving away from the Adelaide United tradition of local coaches seen in its prior seasons.

As of 9 September 2010, Adelaide United had made Australian soccer history by becoming the first team to climb from the bottom of the table to the top, whilst the 2009–10 premiers and champions, Sydney FC, remained rooted at the bottom. Adelaide United also claimed the record for longest undefeated streak in A-League history with their win over Wellington Phoenix in Week 11 of the league, consisting of thirteen games stretching back to the penultimate round of the 2009–10 A-League season. This surpassed Central Coast Mariners&#x27;s previous record of twelve games undefeated set back in the 2005–06 A-League season. Unfortunately for Adelaide United, Brisbane Roar surpassed this newly set record, when the Roar comprehensively won their Week 16 fixture against Central Coast Mariners at Bluetongue Stadium.

Following 18 months under Football Federation Australia (FFA) financial administration, it was announced on 8 November 2010 that a South Australian consortium had taken over ownership of the club with a ten-year licence. New co-owner Greg Griffin steps in as chairman of the club replacing Mel Patzwald, whilst ex-North Adelaide Football Club CEO, Glenn Elliott replaces Sam Ciccarello, who now takes up a role at the FFA.

On 9 January 2011, Adelaide broke its longest winless streak against its rival club Melbourne Victory by posting a 4–1 away win in Melbourne at AAMI Park. Adelaide United then went on to make A-League history by recording the highest winning margin in the league&#x27;s history with an 8–1 win over North Queensland Fury on 21 January 2011. This also marked the first time two players from the same side scored hat-tricks in one game (Sergio van Dijk and Marcos Flores), and matched the all-time highest match aggregate score of 9 goals scored in one match.

Adelaide finished the season by winning 2–1 at Adelaide Oval against Melbourne Victory in front of 21,038 spectators – the club&#x27;s largest crowd of the season. This ensured the club third place in overall standings at the end of the season, and hosting rights for at least the first week of the knock-out Finals Series. Adelaide United went on to defeat Wellington Phoenix in the first week of the Finals under torrential rain but succumbed to Gold Coast United in the second week and were knocked out of the competition on the back of a 2–3 home loss.

Off-season transfers marked the departure of Captain Travis Dodd, long-serving players Lucas Pantelis and Robert Cornthwaite, and of fan favourites Mathew Leckie and Marcos Flores to overseas clubs. In a coup for the club and the A-League, Rini Coolen managed to secure the signatures of Socceroos Bruce Djite, Jon McKain and Dario Vidošić; with the latter being offered the Australian marquee player status at the club for the season.

On 18 December 2011, it was announced that head coach Rini Coolen had been sacked and replaced by former coach John Kosmina as caretaker coach for the rest of the season, including the AFC Champions League group stage of 2012. As part of Kosmina&#x27;s takeover of the head coaching position, Eugene Galeković was named club captain on 28 December 2011, replacing Jon McKain.

Their fourth appearance in the competition – more times than any other Australian club – Adelaide qualified for the 2012 AFC Champions League playoff round by finishing third in the 2010–11 A-League. They were placed in Group E, quickly dubbed the &#x27;Group of Death&#x27; by numerous commentators, alongside Bunyodkor, Gamba Osaka and Pohang Steelers. Adelaide qualified through to the Round of 16 for a third time and then went on to qualify for the quarter-finals with a 1–0 win at home against Nagoya Grampus.

Adelaide faced Bunyodkor in the quarter-finals. Adelaide surrendered a 2–0 lead at home, with Bunyodkor clawing back to end 2–2. The return leg in Tashkent was again locked at 2–2 after 90 minutes of play, requiring the game to go to extra time and possible penalties thereafter. Despite an Iain Ramsay goal in the third minute to give Adelaide the lead, Bunyodkor eventually eliminated Adelaide by scoring in added extra time. Adelaide ended the match with nine men, having Iain Fyfe and Fabian Barbiero both sent off after receiving two yellow cards.

Adelaide United&#x27;s 2012–13 season was John Kosmina&#x27;s first full season as a permanent coach since being appointed in a caretaker role from Rini Coolen in December 2011. The season was also Kosmina&#x27;s first in charge at Adelaide since the 2006–07 season. John Kosmina had expressed his desire to the club for a two-year extension to his contract, but rumours publicly emerged of assistant coach Michael Valkanis being offered a contract extension, but not Kosmina. The coach resigned shortly thereafter. Valkanis was appointed as interim coach until the end of the season, with former Adelaide City player Sergio Melta being appointed as his assistant.

The Reds finished the A-League season fourth but were knocked out of Championship contention by Brisbane Roar 2–1 in an elimination final.

On 30 April 2013, Josep Gombau signed a two-season deal as coach, arriving at the club in July 2013. In the winter transfer window, Gombau was quick to add Spanish flavour into the squad. His first two signings were compatriots and Barcelona youth products Sergio Cirio and Isaías Sánchez. Gombau also brought his long-time assistant coach Pau Marti to work alongside existing assistant coach Michael Valkanis. He also added other players including Tarek Elrich and Steven Lustica, Michael Zullo for a season-long loan and Brent McGrath as a four-week injury replacement player. Awer Mabil and Jordan Elsey were also promoted from the youth system, each rewarded with two-year contracts. Sergio van Dijk was transferred to Persib Bandung and Dario Vidošić to Sion for a reported $700,000 transfer fee.

The Reds had a shaky start to their season under new manager Gombau. They had only a single win in their first nine games for the season and early calls started for the club to show the door to the new man in charge. Gombau quickly changed the club&#x27;s fortunes, getting his second win in round 10 against the Central Coast Mariners, with a 4–0 result. The team continued this form to finish sixth on the table after the 27 home-and-away games, which let them into the finals by two points. Adelaide&#x27;s season was ended by Central Coast in the elimination final, losing 1–0.

The Reds&#x27; highest attendance in the 2013–14 season was 16,504 in the round 2 clash with Melbourne Victory at Hindmarsh Stadium which ended in a 2–2 draw.

Carrying over from the previous season, Josep Gombau was quick to implement a possession-based football style at Adelaide, all the way from the grassroots level of local soccer to the senior side. Gombau further reinforced his dogmatic approach by bringing in FC Barcelona legend Guillermo Amor as the club&#x27;s technical director. While winning the Adelaide fans over, Josep elevated the technical and tactical quality of the local brand, earning the respect and admiration of rival clubs, coaches, and the FFA, who unanimously voted him in as coach of the A-League All Stars team for the 2014 A-League All Stars Game against the visiting Juventus. Gombau&#x27;s United won the inaugural FFA Cup with a 1–0 win against Perth Glory. Gombau left the club in July 2015 to take up a youth coaching role in the United States.

Following the shock resignation of manager Josep Gombau who took up a youth coaching role in the United States shortly before the start of the season, Adelaide United announced Guillermo Amor as his replacement who was serving as the club&#x27;s technical director and Jacobo Ramallo as his assistant who was in charge as director of Adelaide United&#x27;s Football School. Eight rounds into the season, Adelaide was without a win leaving them sitting at the bottom of the ladder with only 3 points and 3 goals scored. However, Adelaide then won 13 of their next 18 games losing just once to finish top of the ladder and win the club&#x27;s second Premier&#x27;s Plate. Following a week off during which the Elimination Finals were played, Adelaide United defeated Melbourne City 4–1 in a Semi-final at Coopers Stadium to advance to the Grand Final where they would for the first time host the Grand Final at the Adelaide Oval.

In the Grand Final, the Reds finally won their first A-League championship, beating the Western Sydney Wanderers 3–1 in front of a crowd of 50,119.

Adelaide United were eliminated in the first round of the 2016 FFA Cup, suffering a stunning 2–1 loss to National Premier Leagues Queensland team Redlands United FC, with the match labelled the biggest upset in FFA Cup history. Adelaide United had to replace five players from its starting grand final team including Bruce Djite, Craig Goodwin, Pablo Sánchez, Stefan Mauk and Bruce Kamau, but they were replaced with youngsters Jesse Makarounas, Nikola Mileusnic, Ben Garuccio, Marc Marino, Jordan O&#x27;Doherty and Riley McGree, experienced pair Henrique and James Holland, and Spanish Striker Sergi Guardiola on loan and South Korean Danny Choi as an injury replacement.

Adelaide United were runners-up in the FFA Cup final against Sydney FC by a 2–1 scoreline. Marco Kurz then had his first A-League game against Wellington Phoenix by a 1–1 draw. Their top scorer was their new signing, Johan Absalonsen who scored 8 goals in all competitions this season. They finished 5th in the A-League, and then they lost in the elimination final against Melbourne Victory by a 2–1 scoreline with a crowd of 15,502.

===2018–present: Cup success and beyond===
Adelaide United were the FFA Cup champions after defeating Sydney FC 2–1 in the final at Coopers Stadium. On March 19, 2019, the club announced they would not be renewing Marco Kurz&#x27; contract. United finished 4th in the regular season. Craig Goodwin was United&#x27;s leading goalscorer scoring 15 goals across all competitions. The Reds hosted an elimination final against Melbourne City where they came out 1–0 victors with the goal coming from Ben Halloran in the 119th minute. Adelaide United were then eliminated in the semi-finals following a loss to Perth Glory on penalties after playing out a 3–3 draw.

In the 2019 FFA Cup Final, Adelaide defeated Melbourne City 4–0 at home, further increasing their claim to have the most FFA Cup titles with three.

Adelaide United continued to qualify for the A-League finals series in the following seasons, finishing 5th in the 2020–21 season, and 4th in the 2021–22 season, with Craig Goodwin returning to the squad on loan in 2021, before permanently signing with the club until 2025. During these seasons, Adelaide placed a large emphasis on bringing through young players from South Australia, and their NPL squad, notable examples during this period were Joe Gauci, who has since earned a cap for the national team, Bernardo, Mohamed Toure, Yaya Dukuly, Ethan Alagich, Asad Kasumovic, Jonny Yull and Nestory Irankunda.

On 4 April 2023, Chairman Piet van der Pol stepped down and was replaced by Ned Morris. The previously anonymous owners were also revealed, being Cor Adriaanse, Rob van Eck, and Yu Lidong.

In the 2022–23 season, Adelaide were challenging Melbourne City for the premiership, with many of their young players earning permanent spots in the squad. The eventual champions Central Coast Mariners made a run late in the season to bump Adelaide down to third on the table, and eventually knock Adelaide out of the championship race in a semi-final. Craig Goodwin, who had recently scored against France and Argentina in the 2022 World Cup, won the 2023 Johnny Warren Medal but returned to Al-Wehda FC in the winter of that year. Adelaide signed former Manchester United-listed midfielder Ryan Tunnicliffe in the off-season. Ryan Kitto was made the captain of the club with Goodwin&#x27;s departure.

Adelaide&#x27;s 2023–24 season began with massive success, beating the reigning Champions Central Coast Mariners and the Premiers Melbourne City with a combined score of 9–0. Highlights of these opening games include Joe Gauci&#x27;s penalty save against Jamie Maclaren, a free kick goal from 17-year-old Nestory Irankunda, and a brace off the bench from Bernardo. On 14 November 2023, Adelaide United confirmed that they had agreed terms with Bayern Munich for the sale of 17-year-old winger, Nestory Irankunda, to join the club at the end of the season. The fee was officially undisclosed, however it was reported to be in the region of AUD$5.7 million plus add-ons, the largest fee ever received by an A-League club. Irankunda was later nominated for Australia&#x27;s &quot;Young Footballer of the Year&quot; award, and became the first Australian to feature in Goal&#x27;s NXGN. Despite valiant performances, Adelaide dropped to 8th on the A-League ladder with losses to Macarthur and Melbourne Victory. They revived their season with a home draw against Wellington and an away win against Sydney in the A-League&#x27;s first Unite Round. The latter of these games included a hat-trick and an assist from Hiroshi Ibusuki. The Japanese striker&#x27;s heroics placed Adelaide in 5th place mid-way through the season

During the January transfer window, Adelaide lost numerous key players: Bernardo terminated his contract to sign for Macarthur FC, Steven Hall was signed by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion&#x27;s youth team, Alexandar Popovic was signed by Korean side Gwangju, and starting goalkeeper Joe Gauci signed for Aston Villa for an undisclosed fee. The second half of the season saw United drop towards the bottom of the ladder, going winless for seven consecutive matches, breaking their streak with a 1–0 win away to Newcastle Jets, and a first home win in three months against Western United thanks to a Nestory Irankunda hat-trick, who became the youngest hat-trick scorer in A-League history, and the second youngest in Australian national league history.

==Sponsors==
Adelaide United&#x27;s 2009–10 playing kit didn&#x27;t feature a sponsor on the front of their kit. Towards the end of the season, United signed a deal with Jim&#x27;s Group which saw the Jim&#x27;s Plumbing logo feature on the front of United&#x27;s home and away kits. The deal only lasted for the remainder of the season as the logo wasn&#x27;t displayed on Adelaide&#x27;s home or away kits in the 2010–11 season.

On 16 December 2010, Coopers Brewery announced that their logo would feature on the front of the jersey for the remainder of the season, in a deal worth to be around $200,000.

As of 1 April 2011, all A-League clubs were able to negotiate new kit supplier deals as the previous contract with Reebok had elapsed and as such, Adelaide United negotiated a 3-year deal with Erreà.

On 2 March 2012, the club announced Legea as the official kit suppliers for their 2012 Asian Champions League campaign. Legea exclusively supplied all of the team&#x27;s authentic on-field and off-field apparel for the club&#x27;s 6 ACL group-stage matches.

On 16 September 2020, Adelaide United announced a partnership with Guangzhou-based sportswear manufacturer UCAN to manufacture and supply the club&#x27;s playing, training, and travel wear. Since that same year, Flinders University feature on the front of the home kit, whilst Australian Outdoor Living feature on the front of the away kit.

==Crest==
Adelaide United&#x27;s original strip was made using the three South Australian state colours: red, blue and yellow. The shirt was mainly red with a large yellow stripe down both sleeves with blue being used for the short colour and the stripe running down each side of the top. The badge also uses the state colours in a stylised swoosh, above what appears to be a football made with the Southern Cross, as opposed to the traditional hexagonal panels of a football. The football is similar in appearance to that of the UEFA Champions League logo.

==Colours and badge==
Since their inception into the A-League, Adelaide United&#x27;s kits, along with the rest of the league, have been manufactured by Reebok. United&#x27;s kit has moved towards a predominately all-red kit, both top and shorts, with black trim. Originally, the away strip was predominantly white, with red sleeves and yellow trim however in 2009 the club launched a predominantly black &#x27;clash&#x27; strip.

The launch of the new national league also saw Adelaide launch a new badge; while keeping a similar look and feel as its predecessor the new badge takes the form of a more traditional football badge with its shield-like border.

Adelaide United is most commonly referred to as &quot;The Reds&quot; because of their predominantly red playing kit. In February 2009 the club&#x27;s head coach, Aurelio Vidmar referred to the City of Adelaide as a &quot;Pissant Town&quot; after suffering a heartbreaking loss. The club&#x27;s supporters eventually utilised the name &quot;Pissants&quot; as a term of endearment and it became an unofficial nickname of the club among its supporters.

==Stadium==

Adelaide United play their home matches at Hindmarsh Stadium, currently known as Coopers Stadium. Previously, two games a year were played at Adelaide Oval, one against interstate rivals Melbourne Victory and traditional rivals Sydney FC. The second match in 2009 saw 23,002 people attend the game. Adelaide United played the 2016 Grand Final at Adelaide Oval and played early-stage cup games at the State Centre for Football in Gepps Cross, and Marden Sports Complex in Marden.

Hindmarsh Stadium seating capacity is 13,500. Adelaide United&#x27;s first home game in the now-defunct National Soccer League saw over 15,000 supporters watch Adelaide win 1–0 over the Brisbane Strikers.

A-League crowds have averaged 10,947 in 2005–06 and over 12,000 supporters attending in both 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons. Even with a lack of on-field success, crowds at United&#x27;s games remained healthy during the 2009–10 season relative to other clubs, largely due to the club&#x27;s strong community-based initiatives. The record attendance for Hindmarsh Stadium was a full house of 17,000 on 12 November 2008 against Gamba Osaka in the historic second leg of the ACL final.

==Support==

Adelaide United&#x27;s main active supporters&#x27; group is called the Red Army.

===Average attendance===
This graph shows the average attendance for home league matches of Adelaide United since their inception. The figures do not include finals matches.

==Rivalries==
===Melbourne Victory FC===

Adelaide United&#x27;s main rivals are Melbourne Victory. Adelaide was again one of two of the leading teams in the 2006–07 season this time against Melbourne that saw an altercation between John Kosmina, the Adelaide United manager, and Kevin Muscat after the Victory captain knocked Kosmina over after entering the technical area to retrieve a ball. Kosmina then jumped up and grabbed Muscat around the throat for a few seconds. Season events culminated in the year&#x27;s grand final that saw Adelaide captain, Ross Aloisi, sent off and Melbourne winning 6–0. The rivalry went beyond extreme after Melbourne defeated Adelaide United 1–0 in the 2008–09 grand final with United imported striker, Cristiano, given a controversial straight red card. The rivalry then went even further when Adelaide United defeated Melbourne 4–1 at AAMI Park after United had been suffering a record-breaking 10-game losing streak against the Victory.

<doc id="1257186" wikidata="Q2521909" url="?curid=1257186" title="The Last Day of Pompeii">
<text>The Last Day of Pompeii is a large history painting by Karl Bryullov produced in 1830–1833 on the subject of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. It is notable for its positioning between Neoclassicism, the predominant style in Russia at the time, and Romanticism as increasingly practised in France.

The painting was received to near universal acclaim and made Bryullov the first Russian painter to have an international reputation. In Russia it was seen as proving that Russian art was as good as art practised in the rest of Europe. It inspired Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s world-famous novel, &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;. Critics in France and Russia both noted, however, that the perfection of the classically modelled bodies seemed to be out of keeping with their desperate plight and the overall theme of the painting, which was a Romantic one of the sublime power of nature to destroy man&#x27;s creations.

==Background==

The Roman city of Pompeii, south of Naples, was under active excavation in the early 19th century, work having begun on the city and its neighbour Herculaneum in the middle of the previous century. Artists were well aware of its potential as a subject. John Martin had painted &quot;The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum&quot; in 1822 and others had sketched and produced engravings of the site.

In 1823, Bryullov arrived in Rome with his brother Aleksandr via Venice and Florence. Aleksandr was a participant in a scientific study and restoration of the Pompeii baths in 1825–26, which led to the publication of his book &quot;Thermes de Pompéi&quot; in Paris in 1829, and Karl may have visited Pompeii in 1824. He saw Alessandro Sanquirico&#x27;s set designs for Giovanni Pacini&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;ultimo giorno di Pompei&quot; (1825), which was performed at Naples and at La Scala, Milan, and visited the Naples museum to study artefacts recovered from Pompeii. He certainly visited Pompeii in 1827 and according to Rosalind Blakesley, was so affected by the remains of the Via dei Sepolcri (Street of the Tombs) that he decided to set his painting in that street. Contemporary letters indicate that he studied Pliny the Younger&#x27;s eye-witness description of the disaster, in which Pliny&#x27;s uncle died, and Pliny&#x27;s observations in his letters to Tacitus were referenced in the picture. Also in literature, Bryullov read Alessandro Manzoni&#x27;s novel &quot;I Promessi Sposi&quot; (&quot;The Betrothed&quot;) (1827) with its historically based account of a disastrous plague and the reactions to it of individuals.
These sources coalesced into the work known as &quot;The Last Day of Pompeii&quot; for which Bryullov painted a compositional sketch in 1828 at the request of Countess Maria Razumovskaya. The main canvas was commissioned by Count Anatoly Demidov, whom Bryullov had met in Naples, and for whom he painted an equestrian portrait the same year. It was to be completed by 1830 for the sum of 40,000 francs, but by the end of that year Bryullov had only got as far as outlining the figures on the canvas in two colours and had given little attention to colour choices. A trip to Bologna and Venice to see work by Tintoretto and Titian gave him the answers he needed.

==Subject and composition==
The subject is the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 that enveloped the city of Pompeii in volcanic ash, killing most of its inhabitants. As a scene from the ancient world it was an appropriate subject for a history painting, then regarded as the highest genre of painting, and the magnitude of the event also made it suitable for a large canvas that would allow Bryullov to showcase all his skills.

Bryullov said that he could only have completed the work with the example of Raphael&#x27;s large and complex work &quot;The School of Athens&quot; (1509–1511) as his model, and he used classical forms recognisable as those used by the Renaissance masters, but combined them with features found in Romantic painting, such as dramatic colouring, the use of chiaroscuro, and a high emotional content. Other works thought to have influenced Bryullov are Raphael&#x27;s &quot;The Fire in the Borgo&quot; (1514–17) and Nicolas Poussin&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1630).

He eschewed the coolness and flatness of the then-prevalent Neoclassicism in favour of excitement and vibrant colour, combined with a deep recession as a horse bolts into the depths of the painting, unseating its master. Nikolai Gogol commented: &quot;His colouring is possibly brighter than it has ever been; his paints burn and hit you in the eye&quot;, but he was not the only one to note that the perfection of the classical figures contrasted with the wretchedness of their predicament.

Bryullov filled the canvas with authentic detail from Pompeii that he had seen at the site and in the museum at Naples such as the artefacts carried by the figures and the authentic paving and kerb stones. Statues toppling from their pedestals bring additional drama and demonstrate the sublime power of nature over man, a common trope in Romantic painting. The figures provide small vignettes of individual experience that reference stories from classical mythology, renaissance painting or ancient literature such as Pliny the Younger&#x27;s account given to Tacitus, but most of the characters preserve their dignity in the face of death indicating Bryullov&#x27;s great debt to the principals of Classicism. Poses and figures are drawn from classical painting or from people the artist knew such as Yuliya Samoylova and her daughters. The soldier and boy rescuing an older man may derive from the story of Aeneas&#x27;s rescue of his father from the destruction of Troy in mythology. To the scene is added an image of the artist himself as a Pompeian artist with his equipment balanced on his head.

==Reception==

The painting took so long to finish that Demidov threatened to cancel its commission, but when it was first shown at Bryullov&#x27;s studio in Italy on Via San Claudio in Rome, it received a rapturous response. Sir Walter Scott is said to have studied the painting for an hour before declaring that it was not an ordinary painting, but an epic and Vincenzo Camuccini described it as a &quot;flaming colossus&quot;. The Italian archaeologist Pietro Ercole Visconti wrote an article praising the painter and the painting. The Uffizi requested a self-portrait of the artist. In Milan, Bryullov was given a standing ovation in a theatre and carried through the city&#x27;s streets wearing a garland of flowers. It was seen there by Edward Bulwer-Lytton whose novel &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; was published in 1834. In Bologna, gallery officials removed Raphael&#x27;s &quot;St Cecilia&quot; from the walls and placed it in a private room when Bryullov asked to copy it.

The reception was slightly cooler when it was displayed at the Paris Salon of 1834. It still won a gold medal, but some critics saw it as slightly outdated compared to Eugène Delacroix&#x27;s &quot;Femmes d&#x27;Alger dans leur Appartement&quot; (1834), which was exhibited alongside it, the high emotional content leading one critic to comment in &quot;L&#x27;Artiste&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;impression est moins voisine de la terreur que du ridicule&quot; (the impression is less akin to terror than ridicule). Rosalind Blakesley attributes this slightly behind-the-times feel to the isolation of contemporary Russian art teaching from the latest French developments since the start of the nineteenth century and the tensions inherent in the work between neo-classicism and romanticism.

It was the first Russian artwork to cause such an interest abroad, making Bryullov the first Russian painter to gain an international reputation. Five foreign academies made him an honorary member and the quantity of positive reviews and critical comment was such that the Society for the Encouragement of Artists published a volume of them in Russian translation.

When the painting arrived in Russia in August 1834, it was received with as much enthusiasm as it had been in Italy, according to Gogol as much by those with a refined taste as those who were ignorant of art. Bryullov was made an honorary free associate of the academy and awarded the Order of St Anne, third class. He was made a professor at the academy in Saint Petersburg and placed in charge of history painting. He met the Tsar. Ivan Turgenev described the painting as &quot;the glory of Russia and Italy&quot; and it inspired Alexander Pushkin to write a poem about the destruction of Pompeii. Russians saw the painting as elevating the status of Russian art in Europe generally and in turn it elevated the status of painters in Russia. Gogol opined that it was a &quot;bright resurrection of painting, which has been for too long in some sort of semi-lethargic state&quot;, but was not alone in seeing a parallel between Pompeii and contemporary Saint Petersburg and the painting as a forecast of divine retribution for the modern city&#x27;s decadent Western ways. The dissident Alexander Herzen, meanwhile, saw it as an allegory about the collapse of European monarchies or the tyrannical power of the Russian state over the individual.

After his great success with &quot;The Last Day of Pompeii&quot;, Bryullov was expected to produce similar large works of history, but most of his attempts remained unfinished and he was criticised for his &quot;&quot;, which was completed in only 17 days in 1834. Instead he found success in portraits of the Russian elite including the royal family.

==Ownership==
In 1834, Demidov presented the painting, for which he had paid 25,000 rubles, to Tsar Nicholas in an attempt to win his favour. It was at first exhibited in the Winter Palace, but in 1836 Nicholas donated it to the Imperial Academy of Arts where it remained until it was installed as the centre of the Russian painting display at the New Hermitage in 1851. It is currently part of the collection of the State Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg.

<doc id="1257191" wikidata="Q109968" url="?curid=1257191" title="Columbus Circle">
<text>Columbus Circle is a traffic circle and heavily trafficked intersection in the New York City borough of Manhattan, located at the intersection of Eighth Avenue, Broadway, Central Park South (West 59th Street), and Central Park West, at the southwest corner of Central Park. The circle is the point from which official highway distances from New York City are measured, as well as the center of the restricted-travel area for C-2 visa holders.

The circle is named after the monument of Christopher Columbus in the center, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The name is also used for the neighborhood that surrounds the circle for a few blocks in each direction. Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, also known as Clinton, is located to the southwest, and the Theater District is to the southeast and the Lincoln Square section of the Upper West Side is to the northwest.

==History==
The traffic circle, located at Eighth Avenue/Central Park West, Broadway, and 59th Street/Central Park South, was designed as part of Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s 1857 vision for Central Park, which included a rotary on the southwest corner of the park. It abuts the Merchant&#x27;s Gate, one of the park&#x27;s eighteen major gates. Similar plazas were planned at the southeast corner of the park (now Grand Army Plaza), the northeast corner (Duke Ellington Circle), and the northwest corner (Frederick Douglass Circle). Clearing of the land area for the circle started in 1868. The actual circle was approved two years later. The Columbus Monument was placed at the center of the circle in 1892.

Columbus Circle was originally known generically as &quot;The Circle&quot;. An 1871 account of the park referred to the roundabout as a &quot;grand circle&quot;. After the 1892 installation of the Columbus Column in the circle&#x27;s center, it became known as &quot;Columbus Circle&quot;, although its other names were also used through the 1900s.
By 1901, construction on the first subway line of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (now the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, used by the ) required the excavation of the circle, and the column and streetcar tracks through the area were put on temporary wooden stilts. As part of the subway line&#x27;s construction, the 59th Street–Columbus Circle station was built underneath the circle. During construction, traffic in the circle was so dangerous that the Municipal Art Society proposed redesigning the roundabout. By February 1904, the station underneath was largely complete, and service on the subway line began on October 27, 1904. The station only served local trains; express trains bypassed the station. The platforms of the IRT subway station were lengthened in 1957–1959, requiring further excavations around Columbus Circle. An additional subway line—the Independent Subway System (IND)&#x27;s Eighth Avenue Line, serving the present-day —was built starting in 1925. At Columbus Circle, workers had to be careful to not disrupt the existing IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line or Columbus Circle overhead. The Columbus monument was shored up during construction, and obstructions to traffic were minimized. The line, which opened in 1932, contains a 4-track, 3-platform express station at 59th Street–Columbus Circle, underneath the original IRT station. The IND station were designed as a single transit hub under Columbus Circle.

===Conversion to traffic circle===

In November 1904, due to the high speeds of cars passing through the circle, the New York City Police Department added tightly spaced electric lights on the inner side of the circle, surrounding the column. The circle was altered in 1905 by William Phelps Eno, a businessman who pioneered many early innovations in road safety and traffic control. In a 1920 book, Eno writes that prior to the implementation of his plan, traffic went around the circle in both directions, causing accidents almost daily. The 1905 plan, which he regarded as temporary, created a counterclockwise traffic pattern with a &quot;safety zone&quot; in the center of the circle for cars stopping; however, the circle was too narrow for the normal flow of traffic. Eno also wrote of a permanent plan, with the safety zones on the outside as well as clearly delineated pedestrian crossings. The redesign marked the first true one-way traffic circle to be constructed anywhere, implementing the ideas of Eugène Hénard. In this second scheme, the public space within the circle, around the monument, was almost as small as the monument&#x27;s base.

The rotary traffic plan was not successful. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article in June 1929 stated that the &quot;Christopher Columbus [monument] is safe and serene, but he&#x27;s the only thing in the Circle that is.&quot; At the time, there were eight entrance and exit points to Columbus Circle: two each from 59th Street/Central Park South, to the west and east; Broadway, to the northwest and southeast; Eighth Avenue/Central Park West, to the south and north; and within Central Park to the northeast. Moreover, streetcars on the former three streets did not go counterclockwise around the rotary, but rather, both tracks of all three streetcar routes went around one side of the monument, creating frequent conflicts between streetcars and automobiles using the rotary in opposite directions. The police officers patrolling the circle had to manage the 58,000 cars that entered Columbus Circle every 12 hours. 

As part of a plan to reorganize traffic in the &quot;Columbus-Central Park Zone&quot;, Eno&#x27;s circular-traffic plan was abolished in November 1929, and traffic was allowed to go around the circle in both directions. Central Park West, a one-way street that formerly carried southbound traffic into the circle, was now one-way northbound. The bidirectional entrance roads into Central Park, which fed into northbound and eastbound West Drive, were both changed to one-way streets because West Drive had been changed from bidirectional to one-way southbound and eastbound. Traffic going straight through Columbus Circle was forced to go around the left side of the monument, while any traffic making turns from the circle had to go counterclockwise around the rotary using the right side.

=== Alterations ===

The bidirectional traffic pattern through Columbus Circle failed to eliminate congestion. In 1941, engineers with the New York City Parks Department and the Manhattan Borough President&#x27;s office formed a tentative agreement to redesign Columbus Circle yet again. &quot;Local&quot; and &quot;express&quot; lanes would segregate north–south traffic passing within the circle. Local north–south traffic and all east–west traffic would go around the circle&#x27;s perimeter in a counterclockwise direction, along a roadway. Through north–south traffic on Broadway, Eighth Avenue, and Central Park West would use two divided roadways with landscaped medians, running in chords on either side of the Columbus monument. Traffic from southbound Broadway and northbound Eighth Avenue would use the western chord, and northbound Broadway and southbound Central Park West would use the eastern chord. The center of the circle would be refurbished with a tree-lined plaza, and pedestrian traffic from the north and south would be able to pass through the center of the circle. The exit into Columbus Circle from West Drive would be eliminated, and the entrance to West Drive would be relocated. In a related development, the 59th Street trolley route&#x27;s tracks would be removed. This was crucial to the reorganization of the circle, as the trolley had already been discontinued.

The proposed reorganization of Columbus Circle was widely praised by civic groups and city officials. On the other hand, William Phelps Eno advocated for a return to his original 1905 proposal. However, the plan still had some issues, the largest of which was that traffic traveling on Broadway in either direction would be routed onto Eighth Avenue or Central Park West, and vice versa. The reconfiguration of the circle was deferred due to World War II. The trolley routes that ran through Columbus Circle were discontinued in 1946, but the bus routes that replaced the trolley lines took the same convoluted paths through the circle. In June 1949, it was announced that the reconstruction of Columbus Circle would finally begin. Work on removing the abandoned trolley tracks commenced in August. In conjunction with Columbus Circle&#x27;s rehabilitation, the New York City Department of Transportation designed a variable traffic light system for the circle. The project was originally set to be complete by November 1949 at a cost of $100,000. However, delays arose due to the need to maintain traffic flows through the circle during construction. The project was ultimately completed that December.

The entirety of Eighth Avenue south of Columbus Circle was converted to northbound-only traffic in 1950. In 1956, in preparation for the opening of the New York Coliseum on Columbus Circle&#x27;s west side, traffic on Central Park West and Broadway was rearranged. Central Park West was made northbound-only for a short segment north of the circle, and two blocks of Broadway south of the circle were converted to southbound-only. A new northbound roadway was cut through the southern tip of the center traffic island that contained the statue, from Eighth Avenue to the eastern chord. At the same time, the eastern chord was converted to northbound-only.

=== 1990s and 2000s renovation ===
By the late 20th century, it was regarded as one of the most inhospitable of the city&#x27;s major intersections, as the interior circle was being used for motorcycle parking, and the circle as a whole was hard for pedestrians to cross. In 1979, noted architecture critic Paul Goldberger said that the intersection was &quot;a chaotic jumble of streets that can be crossed in about 50 different ways—all of them wrong.&quot; In 1987, the city awarded a $20 million contract to Olin Partnership and Vollmer Associates to create a new design for the circle. 

The circle was refurbished in 1991–1992 as part of the 500th-anniversary celebration of Columbus&#x27;s arrival in the Americas. In 1998, as a result of the study, the circular-traffic plan was reinstated, with all traffic going around the circle in a counterclockwise direction. The center of the circle was planned for further renovations, with a proposed park across. The design for a full renovation of the circle was finalized in 2001. The project started in 2003, and was completed in 2005. It included a new water fountain by Water Entertainment Technologies, who also designed the Fountains of Bellagio; benches made of ipe wood; and plantings encircling the monument. The fountain, the main part of the reconstructed circle, contains 99 jets that periodically change in force and speed, with effects ranging between &quot;swollen river, a rushing brook, a driving rain or a gentle shower&quot;. The inner circle is about , while the outer circle is around . The redesign was the recipient of the 2006 American Society of Landscape Architects&#x27; General Design Award Of Honor. In 2007 Columbus Circle was awarded the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence silver medal.

== Monument ==
The Columbus Monument, a column installed at the center of Columbus Circle, consists of a marble statue of Columbus atop a granite rostral column on a four-stepped granite pedestal. Created by Italian sculptor Gaetano Russo, the monument was installed at the center of the circle in 1892. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Neighborhood ==
The five streets radiating from the circle separate the immediate surrounding area into five distinct portions.

In the early 20th century, much of the development around Columbus Circle was spurred by magazine publisher William Randolph Hearst, who acquired several plots before he ultimately erected the Hearst Magazine Building at Eighth Avenue and 57th Street in 1928. Hearst had envisioned the creation of a large Midtown headquarters for his company near Columbus Circle, in the belief that the area would become the city&#x27;s next large entertainment district. By the late 1920s, Hearst was acquiring large amounts of land in the area in an effort to create a &quot;Hearst Plaza&quot; near Columbus Circle. The Hearst Magazine Building, later expanded into the Hearst Tower, is the only remnant of this scheme, the other parts of the proposal having collapsed in the Great Depression.

=== West ===

To the west of the circle is a superblock spanning two streets, bounded by Broadway, 60th Street, Ninth Avenue, 58th Street, and Eighth Avenue. The superblock was formerly two separate blocks. In 1901 the first theatre built in the Columbus Circle area, the Circle Theatre, was built. From 1902 to 1954, the Majestic Theatre occupied the more southerly of the two blocks.

Robert Moses closed and eliminated that block of 59th Street during the New York Coliseum&#x27;s construction from 1954 to 1956. The construction project, in turn, was the culmination of an effort to remove San Juan Hill, the slum that had been located at the site. Until the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was built in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen in the 1980s, the Coliseum was the primary event venue for New York City. By 1985, there were plans to replace the Coliseum, and after a series of delays, the Coliseum was demolished in 2000.

Since 2003, the site has been occupied by Deutsche Bank Center (originally Time Warner Center). The center consists of a pair of towers 53 stories high. The complex also hosts the Shops at Columbus Circle mall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the New York City studio headquarters of CNN, and the Mandarin Oriental, New York hotel. The mall inside the complex includes prestigious restaurants in the center such as Bad Roman, Per Se, and Masa.

=== North ===
The north side of Columbus Circle is bounded by Broadway, Central Park West, and 61st Street. In 1911, Hearst bought this city block. The plot was developed with a three-story building by 1914, designed by Charles E. Birge. Its superstructure was designed to support the weight of a 30-story tower that was never built.

The 44-story Gulf and Western Building (later the Trump International Hotel and Tower) was completed on the site in 1969 or 1970. It served in this capacity until the conglomerate filed for bankruptcy in 1991. In 1994, Donald Trump announced his plans to convert the building into a mixed-purpose hotel and condominium tower. Renovations started in 1995, and were completed by 1997. The building was stripped to its steel skeleton and reclad in a new facade, becoming the Trump International Hotel and Tower. The steel globe outside the building was installed in this renovation.

=== Northeast ===
On the northeast lies the Merchant&#x27;s Gate to Central Park, dominated by the USS &quot;Maine&quot; National Monument. The USS &quot;Maine&quot; monument was designed by Harold Van Buren Magonigle and sculpted by Attilio Piccirilli, who did the colossal group and figures, and Charles Keck, who was responsible for the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; plaque. An imposing Beaux-Arts edifice of marble and gilded bronze, it was dedicated in 1913 and was funded by Hearst. The statue is a memorial to sailors killed aboard the battleship USS &quot;Maine&quot;, whose mysterious 1898 explosion in Havana harbor precipitated the Spanish–American War.

=== South ===
Actors&#x27; Equity was founded in 1913 in the old Pabst Grand Circle Hotel, on the southern side of the circle.

The original structure at 2 Columbus Circle was torn down in 1960. It was replaced by 2 Columbus Circle, an International Modernist tower designed by architect Edward Durrell Stone to house the Huntington Hartford Gallery of Modern Art. Vacated when the city&#x27;s Department of Cultural Affairs departed in 1998, 2 Columbus Circle was listed as one of the World Monuments Fund&#x27;s &quot;100 most endangered sites&quot; in 2006. After a renovation by architect Brad Cloepfil, the building became the new home of the Museum of Arts and Design in 2008. Its radical transformation was controversial for the failure of the city&#x27;s Landmarks Preservation Commission to hold hearings on its worthiness for designation.

=== Southeast ===
Several buildings are on the block bordering the circle&#x27;s southeast section. 240 Central Park South, a balconied moderne apartment building across Broadway from the museum, is directly on the southeast corner of the circle. Built between 1939 and 1940 to designs by Albert Mayer and Julian Whittlesey, it is a city-designated landmark and a National Registered Historic Place. 240 Central Park South has 28 stories across two apartment blocks, and is variously quoted as having either 325, 326, or 327 apartments. The building contains several roof gardens, and from the outset, was marketed toward people who wanted suburban lifestyles.

On Central Park South, just east of 240 Central Park South, is the Gainsborough Studios. Designed by Charles W. Buckham, it was built between 1907 and 1908 as artists&#x27; cooperative housing, and rises 16 stories with 34 studio units, some of them double-story units. The facade has a bust of the English painter Thomas Gainsborough, a bas-relief by Isidore Konti, and tile murals by Henry Chapman Mercer. It is a New York City designated landmark.

To the east of 240 Central Park South and the Gainsborough Studios is 220 Central Park South, a 70-story residential skyscraper designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects and SLCE Architects, and completed in 2019. The building contains some of the most expensive residences ever sold in New York City.

On 58th Street, east of 220 Central Park South, are two New York City designated landmarks: the Helen Miller Gould Stable and the firehouse of Engine Company 23. The four-story horse stable, at 213 West 58th Street, was designed by York and Sawyer in the French Renaissance style for wealthy philanthropist Helen Miller Gould. Completed in 1902–1903 on the site of an existing stable, the stable became Allan Murray&#x27;s shoe shop in the 1950s, and has served as the Unity Center of Practical Christianity since 1982. It has a limestone base with a large entrance arch; a limestone-and-brick facade on the second and third stories; a bracketed cornice over the third story; and a hip roof on the fourth story, with a dormer window. The stable was one of several on that block of West 58th Street in the early 20th century, and is the only remaining former stable on the block.

The adjoining firehouse of Engine Company 23, at 215 West 58th Street, was designed by Alexander H. Stevens (the New York City Fire Department&#x27;s superintendent of buildings) in the Beaux-Arts style. It was constructed between 1905 and 1906 to replace a former firehouse at 233 West 58th Street, now taken up by the 240 Central Park South apartment building. The design contains an arched fire truck entrance at ground level; a limestone-and-brick facade on the second and third stories, with two small windows flanking a large window on each story; a bracket above the second story; and a parapet atop the third story. The building remains an active firehouse of the FDNY.

=== 3, 4, 5, and 6 Columbus Circle ===

3, 4, 5, and 6 Columbus Circle are the numbers given to four buildings on the south side of 58th Street. From east to west, the buildings are numbered 5, 3, 4, and 6 Columbus Circle.

5 Columbus Circle (also known by its address, 1790 Broadway), is a , 20-story tower on the southeast corner of Broadway and 58th Street. It was originally built as the headquarters of the United States Rubber Company (U.S. Rubber) in 1912. It was part of Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Automobile Row&quot; during the early 20th century. The lobby contains part of a flagship store for Nordstrom, which extends into the Central Park Tower and 1776 Broadway.

Between Eighth Avenue and Broadway on the south side of 58th Street is 3 Columbus Circle (also 1775 Broadway), a , 26-story tower. It is occupied by Young &amp; Rubicam, Bank of America, Chase Bank, and Gilder Gagnon Howe &amp; Co. The tower sits atop a 3-story structure called the Colonnade Building. The first three stories were built in 1923 and the top 23 stories were added in 1927–1928. During the expansion, the original building&#x27;s three-story Ionic supports were kept. The new expansion, designed by Shreve &amp; Lamb, hosted General Motors&#x27; headquarters from 1927 to 1968. In 1969, Midtown Realty purchased the building&#x27;s lease, and in 1980, acquired the land. Half of the building was leased by Bankers Trust until the late 1980s, and Newsweek leased a third of the building from 1994 until 2006. When the Moinian Group purchased the building in 2000, the building assumed its current name; a subsequent renovation refurbished the exterior and removed all remnants of the Colonnade Building. A neon sign for CNN was located on the roof of the building from the mid-2000s to 2015. A Nordstrom annex is at the base of 3 Columbus Circle.

4 Columbus Circle, an eight-story low-rise located at 989 Eighth Avenue at the southwest corner of the intersection with 58th Street, was built in the late 1980s. Swanke Hayden Connell Architects designed the building, which houses the furniture company Steelcase on the upper floors and a Duane Reade and a Starbucks on the ground floor. Cerberus Capital Management bought the building in 2006 for $82.9 million. In 2011, it was sold to German real estate firm GLL Real Estate Partners for $96.5 million.

Directly to the west is 6 Columbus Circle, an 88-room, 12-floor boutique hotel called 6 Columbus. Acquired by the Pomeranc Group in 2007, the hotel was put on sale in December 2015. A tower is planned for the site.

== Transportation ==
The buses all serve the circle, with the M5, M7, M20 and M104 providing through service and the southbound M10 terminating near the circle. Under the circle is the New York City Subway&#x27;s 59th Street–Columbus Circle station, served by the .

== Cultural significance ==

===Geographic center===
Columbus Circle is the traditional municipal zero-mile point from which all official city distances are measured, although Google Maps uses New York City Hall for this purpose. For decades, Hagstrom sold maps that showed the areas within or from Columbus Circle.

The travel area for recipients of a C-2 visa, which is issued for the purpose of immediate and continuous transit to or from the headquarters of the United Nations, is limited to a 25-mile radius of Columbus Circle. The same circle coincidentally defines the city&#x27;s &quot;film zone&quot; that local unions operate in, a counterpart to Los Angeles&#x27; studio zone. The New York City government employee handbook considers a trip beyond a 75-mile radius from Columbus Circle as long-distance travel.

=== As a center for soapbox orators ===
The circle became known as a center for soapbox orators in the early-mid 20th century, comparable to Speakers Corner in London. It became a home particularly for non-leftists in contrast to Union Square, and for a time in the late 1930s it became a home to a number of far right speakers. The area sometimes had a poor reputation for cranks and street preachers, the &quot;lunatic fringe whose tub-thumping make a nightmare of Columbus Circle&quot; condemned by a New York Court of Appeals ruling in a case related to elsewhere in the city, that prompted mid-20th century configurations, but was also sometimes showcased by the national government as a rambunctious symbol of American freedom of speech.

=== In popular culture ===
Columbus Circle was featured in the 1954 romantic comedy film &quot;It Should Happen to You&quot;, in which Judy Holliday&#x27;s character, Gladys Glover, began her quest for fame by renting a large billboard overlooking Columbus Circle. The &quot;USS Maine Memorial&quot;, was featured in the 1976 movie &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, where Robert De Niro&#x27;s character was thwarted in an attempt to assassinate a presidential nominee. Columbus Circle was featured in the 1984 movie &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; as the place where the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man manifests and then walks up Central Park West. The shooting of Joseph Colombo in Columbus Circle by Jerome A. Johnson in 1971 was featured in the 2019 film &quot;The Irishman&quot;. Starting in seasons 6 of the TV show &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, the Venture family relocates to a skyscraper located on Columbus Circle.

<text>Emil Schürer (2 May 184420 April 1910) was a German Protestant theologian known mainly for his study of the history of the Jews around the time of Jesus&#x27; ministry.

==Biography==
Schürer was born in Augsburg. After studying at the universities of Erlangen, Berlin and Heidelberg from 1862 to 1866, he became in 1873 professor &quot;extraordinarius&quot; at Leipzig. Later on, he served as professor &quot;ordinarius&quot; at the universities of Giessen (from 1878), Kiel (from 1890) and Göttingen (from 1895 to 1910). In 1876 he founded and edited the &quot;Theologische Literaturzeitung&quot;, which he edited with Adolf von Harnack from 1881 to 1910. He died after a long illness in 1910 in Göttingen.

==Works==
His elaborate work on the history of the Jews in the time of Christ, &quot;Geschichte des jüdischen Volkes im Zeitalter Jesu Christi&quot; (1886–1890; 4th edition 1901–1909), made him one of the best known of modern German scholars in Great Britain and the United States. The second edition was translated into English under the title &quot;A History of the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus Christ&quot; (1885–1891). Later, a revised English version of the work was created under the editorship of Géza Vermes, Fergus Millar and Matthew Black, with the slightly different title of &quot;The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ&quot; (1973–1987). In its earliest form, this work appeared as &quot;Lehrbuch der neutestamentlichen Zeitgeschichte&quot; (1874).

His other works include:
* &quot;Schleiermachers Religionsbegriff und die philosophischen Voraussetzungen desselben&quot; (1868) – Friedrich Schleiermacher&#x27;s concept of religion and its philosophical presuppositions.
* &quot;Die Gemeindeverfassung der Juden in Rom in der Kaiserzeit&quot; (1879) – The community rule of the Jews in Rome during the Imperial period.

<text>Koninklijke Nederlandsch-Indische Luchtvaart Maatschappij (in English: Royal Dutch Indies Airways) was the flag carrier of the former Dutch East Indies. Headquartered in Amsterdam, KNILM was &quot;not&quot; a subsidiary of the better-known KLM (Royal Dutch Airlines), despite the similar name. The airline had its headquarters in Amsterdam and an office in on the grounds of Tjililitan Airfield (current Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport) in Batavia (current Jakarta).

==Founding and expansion==
KNILM was founded on 16 July 1928 as the NILM by a group of 32 Netherlands Indian investors with a capitalization of NLG 5 million. To prevent confusion with an existing insurance company &quot;Nillmij&quot;, it was appended with the &quot;Koninklijk&quot; (Royal) title on 15 October 1928. The airline operated in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia), and later, parts of Southeast Asia and Australia.
Its first regular operations were between Batavia (now Jakarta) - Bandung, and Batavia - Semarang, starting on 1 November 1928. The ceremony was held at Cililitan airport in Batavia (now Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport). The Batavia-Semarang flight was later extended to Surabaya. Gradually, the services were expanded to include other islands in the archipelago, namely to Palembang and Medan in Sumatra, Balikpapan and Tarakan in Kalimantan, and Denpasar in Bali. Immediately before the Pacific War, KNILM also created a network in the eastern part of the East Indies archipelago, serving towns such as Ambon. For this purpose, amphibious aircraft were used, due to the lack of airstrip facilities in the region.

As early as 1930, KNILM began its first international flight to Singapore. On 3 July 1938 KNILM began operations to Sydney, stopping at Darwin, Cloncurry and Charleville. KNILM did not fly to the Netherlands, as the Amsterdam-Batavia weekly service was operated by KLM.

===Routes (in 1936)===

*Batavia-Bandung (twice daily in wet season, thrice daily in dry season)
*Batavia-Semarang-Surabaya (daily)
*Batavia-Palembang-Singapore-Pekanbaru (weekly)
*Batavia-Palembang-Pakanbaru-Medan (weekly)
*Batavia-Surabaya-Banjarmasin-Balikpapan-Tarakan (weekly)
*Medan-Penang-Bangkok (weekly)
*Surabaya-Denpasar-Kupang-Darwin (weekly)

==War and demise==

During the Japanese attack of the Dutch East Indies, KNILM was utilized for evacuation flights and transport of troops. On December 28, 1941, a KNILM Douglas DC-3 &quot;Nandoe&quot; (PK-ALN) was destroyed on the ground by Japanese fighters at Medan, killing all crew members and passengers. Immediately before and after the Japanese invasion on 1 March 1942, all KNILM aircraft with sufficient range were evacuated to Australia. On 7 March 1942, one day before the capitulation of Java, the last KNILM aircraft took off from the Boeabatoeweg in Bandung. A number of KNILM aircraft in Darwin were destroyed by the Japanese during the bombing of Darwin. In all, 11 KNILM aircraft managed to escape to Australia: 3 Douglas DC-5s, 2 DC-3s, 2 DC-2s and 3 Lockheed Model 14 Super Electras. In mid-May 1942 the remaining aircraft were sold to the American military.

After Indonesian independence the KNILM could no longer operate due to the fighting between Indonesian nationalists and the Dutch military. All flights in the period were flown using military aircraft, coordinated through the Netherlands Indies Government Air Transport (NIGAT). On paper, KNILM was reinstated to operate charter flights to eastern Indonesian locations. Starting on 16 November 1946 it operated a weekly trans-Pacific flight between Batavia and Los Angeles. The service was performed with four-engined DC-4s of the NIGAT. It was not successful and was discontinued after a few months.

KNILM was officially disbanded on 1 August 1947, and the remaining assets were transferred to KLM, which created the KLM Interinsulair Bedrijf (the precursor of Garuda Indonesia) to operate air services between islands in the Indonesian archipelago.

<text>Jewett William Adams (August 6, 1835 – June 18, 1920) was an American politician who was the fourth governor of Nevada. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Biography==
Adams was born in South Hero, Vermont. He was educated in the common schools of Vermont. He married Emma Lee on January 16, 1878, and the couple adopted a daughter, Frances R. Adams.

==Career==
Adams worked as a merchant and a rancher before moving west with the California Gold Rush in 1851. He ran a general store in Mariposa County, California until he was hired as paymaster on the estate of John C. Fremont in 1860. In 1864, he moved to Nevada, where he worked in mining, freighting, cattle raising, and owned a general store. He was elected the fourth lieutenant governor of Nevada, serving from 1874 to 1882.

In 1882 Adams was elected Governor, serving one term from 1883 to 1887. During his tenure, the site for the University of Nevada was moved to Reno, the silver industry flourished, and railroad development was promoted.

Adams became Superintendent of the United States Mint in Carson City from 1894 to 1898. In 1896, forming a partnership with William McGill, a cattleman, he built one of the largest ranches in the state of Nevada.

==Death==
In 1915, Adams and his family moved to San Francisco, where he died on June 18, 1920, at the age of 84. He is interred at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park, Colma, San Mateo County, California.

<text>Carl Wilhelm Freund Walther (22 November 1858 – 9 July 1915) was a German gunsmith from Zella-Mehlis, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1886, Walther founded the firm of Carl Walther GmbH.

Carl Walther&#x27;s father, August Theodor Albert Walther, was a brass and iron caster. His mother, Rosalie Wilhelmine Amalie Pistor, came from the gunsmith family of Pistor, William Pistor&#x27;s daughter. Carl Walther studied under gunsmith Willibald Barthelmes and later under Albin Schneider. Walther worked for the Jopp company in Zella-Mehlis, making Mauser rifles. In the fall of 1886, Walther opened his gunshop in Zella-Mehlis. Walther soon hired additional workers to meet the demand for the sporting rifles he made. In 1888, Walther married Minna Georgine Pickert, the daughter of the revolver manufacturer Christian Friedrich Pickert, and they had five sons. In 1903, after three of his sons entered the firm, the focus turned to the production of pistols. In 1908, Carl Walther, together with Fritz Walther, his eldest son, designed and produced the first usable German self-loading pistol. Fritz Walther took over the management of the firm after his father&#x27;s death in 1915.

<text>Guillermo &quot;Guille&quot; Luis Franco Farquarson (born 3 November 1976) is a former professional footballer who played as a striker. Born and raised in Argentina, he played for the Mexico national team.

==Early life==
Guillermo Franco was born in Corrientes, the capital city of the Corrientes Province in Argentina.

==Club career==
===San Lorenzo===
Franco began his career with Argentine Primera División side San Lorenzo, playing with the team from 1996 to 2002 mainly as a right winger.

===Monterrey===
He then joined Mexican Monterrey in the middle of 2002, and made his debut during the 2002 Apertura. Franco was very successful with the &quot;Rayados&quot;, and led the league in scoring during the 2004 Apertura with 15 goals in 16 games, playing as a striker. He was part of the team that won the Mexican Primera División championship in 2003 and achieved runner-up position twice in 2004 and 2005.

===Villarreal===
Subsequently, Franco spent three years in Spain playing for Villarreal, but his spell was plagued with injuries. In his first season, Franco helped Villarreal reach the semifinal of the UEFA Champions League where they lost to Arsenal. Franco also scored a goal that qualified Villarreal for the UEFA Cup, in a 1–0 victory against Celta de Vigo.

===West Ham United===
In September 2009, Franco signed for West Ham United on a one-year contract, becoming the first Mexican to play for the Hammers. On 25 September, it was disclosed that due to West Ham&#x27;s perilous financial situation following former chairman Björgólfur Guðmundsson&#x27;s financial collapse, West Ham&#x27;s CEO Scott Duxbury, and their Sporting and Football Technical Director Gianluca Nani, had part financed the deal from their own salaries.
Franco made his debut for West Ham on 17 October 2009 in a 2–1 away defeat to Stoke City.
He scored his first goal for the team on 31 October 2009 to put them 1–0 up against Sunderland away from home, in a game that finished 2–2. Franco became the third Mexican player to score in the Premier League, Jared Borgetti and Carlos Vela being the first and second respectively. On 24 April 2010, Franco assisted Scott Parker, who scored for the winner in a 3–2 victory against Wigan Athletic; a win which would see them safe from relegation. In May it was announced that West Ham would release Franco.

===Vélez Sársfield===
The striker then spent one semester as a free agent, until he joined Vélez Sársfield back in Argentina in January 2011. He signed a one-year deal, and made his debut coming on as a second-half substitute for Santiago Silva in a 2–2 draw at Independiente in the first fixture of the 2011 Clausura. Subsequently, he played the starting minutes of the Copa Libertadores debut against Caracas FC, suffering a shoulder injury that left him out for the remainder of the season. Having played less than 30 minutes, he offered the club to terminate his contract, or suspend his salary until he recovered, though Vélez rejected it. He returned for the 2011 Copa Libertadores quarter-finals, entering the field and scoring one goal from a penalty in a 4–2 victory over Libertad. He also played the last 5 games of the 2011 Clausura (one as a starter), helping his team win the Argentine league title.

===Pachuca===
On 21 January 2012, he joined Pachuca of the Mexican Primera División. The next season, the Chicago Fire signed him.

===Chicago Fire===
Franco signed with Major League Soccer club Chicago Fire on 14 September 2012. On 21 January 2013 the club announced Franco&#x27;s contract option was not picked up for the new season.

On 29 January 2013, Franco announced his retirement from football.

==International career==
In 2004, Franco became a naturalized Mexican citizen after settling in Mexico in 2002; and made senior national team debut in 2005.

Franco played at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and was a part of the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup squad. During the 2010 World Cup qualification, he contributed two goals in six games. He played in all four matches for Mexico at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

In September 2010, Franco announced his retirement from international football.

<doc id="1257229" wikidata="Q933792" url="?curid=1257229" title="Serenus Sammonicus">
<text>Quintus Serenus Sammonicus (died 212) was a Roman savant and tutor to Geta and Caracalla who became fatally involved in politics; he was also author of a didactic medical poem, &quot;Liber Medicinalis&quot; (&quot;The Medical Book&quot;; also known as &quot;De medicina praecepta saluberrima&quot;), probably incomplete in the extant form, as well as many lost works.

==Works and influence==

Serenus was &quot;a typical man of letters in an Age of Archaism and a worthy successor to Marcus Cornelius Fronto and Aulus Gellius, one whose social rank and position is intimately bound up with the prevailing passion for grammar and a mastery of ancient lore&quot;. According to Macrobius, who referenced his work for his &quot;Saturnalia&quot;, he was &quot;the learned man of his age&quot;. Maurus Servius Honoratus and Arnobius both employed his erudition to their own ends. He possessed a library of 60,000 volumes.

His most quoted work was &quot;Res reconditae&quot;, in at least five books, of which fragments only are preserved in quotations. The surviving work, &quot;De medicina praecepta&quot;, in 1115 hexameters, contains a number of popular remedies, borrowed from Pliny the Elder and Pedanius Dioscorides, and various magic formulae, amongst others the famous abracadabra, as a cure for fever and ague. It concludes with a description of the famous antidote of Mithridates VI of Pontus.

It was much used in the Middle Ages, and is of value for the ancient history of popular medicine. The syntax and metre are remarkably correct. According to the unreliable &quot;Augustan History&quot; he was a famous physician and polymath, who was put to death with other friends of Geta in December 212, at a banquet to which he had been invited by Caracalla shortly after the assassination of his brother.

The first printed edition of &quot;De medicina praecepta&quot; was edited by Giovanni Sulpizio da Veroli, before 1484.

<doc id="1257240" wikidata="Q2211180" url="?curid=1257240" title="Sadistik Exekution">
<text>Sadistik Exekution was an Australian extreme metal band from Sydney. The band formed in 1985, although their main active period was from 1986 until 2004. Known for their outrageous live show antics, notorious behaviour and non conformist attitude, Sadistik Exekution also wrote, recorded and performed their own extreme form of death metal. Throughout their career, the band members have firmly stated they should not at all be confused with or wrongly labelled as &#x27;black metal&#x27;. Ironically however, the band was also quite influential on some of the early Scandinavian black metal bands, as well as other extreme metal bands from around the world. Their last official live show was in Sydney in 1999, although they did re-unite once more in November 2009, to perform as the main act at the first annual Australian Metal Awards in Sydney.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The band first came together after bass player Dave Slave met vocalist Rok outside an Iron Maiden concert in Sydney in May 1985. For the remainder of that year and into the first half of 1986, Dave and Rok rehearsed with a number of different guitarists and drummers and began writing material. However, the problem of finding reliable musicians that were capable of playing this extreme form of metal seemed ongoing. Eventually, Dave Slave and Rok decided to try their luck by temporarily relocating to Melbourne through the middle of 1986.

During this period, Slave had appeared on the talent-quest segment of the iconic Australian TV program &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; and after playing a bass solo, he proceeded to throw his custom made American made BC Rich bass guitar to the floor, breaking it beyond repair. This was also around the time they met their future guitarist, the Rev. Kriss Hades. However, due to various factors, Slave and Rok eventually returned to Sydney in September 1986, leaving Hades behind.

At the same time, former Slaughter Lord guitarist Sandy Vahdani had been rehearsing some new material with a drummer called Sloth. Interestingly, Sloth happened to be distantly related to Dave Slave and both Sandy and Dave had previously been in a small time local Sydney thrash band called Hammer&#x27;s Thrust. By the end of September, the four officially united as Sadistik Exekution and began writing songs that would eventually be recorded on the band&#x27;s debut album. Before the end of 1986 they had planned to include Rev. Kriss Hades in the line up, as a five piece act, but this didn&#x27;t eventuate.

While the band continued to rehearse and write new material, Dave Slave and Rok relentlessly pursued local publicity, while Rok also began his correspondence with key members of the then embryonic Norwegian and Swedish black metal scenes. Euronymous from Mayhem can be seen wearing one of the band&#x27;s t-shirts in several photographs from the late 1980s and early 90s and Rok was also in regular contact with Jon &#x27;Metalion&#x27; Kristiansen, of Slayer magazine fame. Rok also had correspondence with Quorthon of Bathory and a number of other bands and identities who went on to become more well known.

Unfortunately though, problems continued to plague the band and despite them being very close to playing live in Sydney several times from 1987 to 1989, one thing or another was always there to stop them. In March 1988 the band went into the studio to record The Magus album and once again, problem after problem delayed their progress. After countless delays and difficulties, The Magus album was finally released in June 1991 by the Sydney label Vampire Records.

This year also marked the first live performances of the band in Sydney and Melbourne. Sandy had left the band soon after The Magus recording sessions and Rev. Kriss Hades had moved to Sydney and became a full time member in 1989. They very quickly established themselves as a formidable live act during 1991, with outrageous antics, onstage fighting, amps blowing up, crowd violence and generally absurd behaviour. All the while though, they took their music quite seriously and despite their appearance and manner, the incredibly fast and technically advanced songs were always at the heart of their shows and recordings.

=== &quot;We Are Death&quot; ===
In 1993, Sloth left the band (which he did several times over the years) soon after they had recorded most of the material their second album. Replacement drummer, Steve &#x27;The Mechanik&#x27; Hoban played on one track, which was Astral Abortis. A demo tape featuring the core songs of the album was sent to French label Osmose Productions. Originally intended to be called &#x27;Spiritual Dynamix&#x27;, the words &quot;We Are Death... Fukk You!&quot; were printed on the demo tapes. This being a reaction to what they believed was constant misrepresentation as being labelled a black metal band. The label mistook these words to be the title of the album and released it under that name. It soon became a successful release for the label and in 1995 the band was flown to Europe, to be part of a tour with Finnish band Impaled Nazarene and American act Absu.

The Mechanik had injured his back at a Bolt Thrower concert in Sydney only weeks before the tour, resulting in an extended hospital stay in a major Sydney hospital&#x27;s spinal injuries unit. So he was unable to play drums for many months afterwards and the band had no choice but to quickly search for a replacement drummer.

Melbourne based drummer Matt &#x27;Skitz&#x27; Sanders from the band Damaged was recruited and rushed into rehearsals for the tour. After the first few dates of the tour, it was soon realised that the other Sadistik Exekution members were behaving in an unprofessional manner, resulting in various problems. It was during this tour that one of the most famous incidents in the band&#x27;s history occurred. With only a few more dates to be played in Italy and Germany, Dave Slave, Kriss Hades and Rok began fighting and causing damage to the tour bus. After a short period, their behaviour got out of control and the bus was stopped while tour management and the bus drivers were deciding how to deal with the situation. Eventually the tour proceeded, although the guitarist Kriss Hades struggled to play the rest of the shows with a badly broken finger. Upon returning to Australia, Sadistik Exekution ceased all activity for many several months while Hades recovered. The band&#x27;s outrageous behaviour during this tour also meant that the band were never invited to return to Europe for any further tours or live shows for the remainder of the decade and beyond.

=== &quot;K.A.O.S.&quot; ===
With Sloth back in the band once more, Sadistik Exekution spent most of 1996 working on their third album KAOS, which was initially released through Australian label Shock Records in May 1997. A mini EP called Sadistik Elektrokution was also released by Shock Records in 1998 which featured remixed versions of a few previous songs as well as a bass solo by Dave Slave.

KAOS was then released again in 1998 by Osmose Productions and this version had a few small differences in the artwork and layout. Faster and rawer than anything they had produced before, this album saw the beginning of a particularly active period for the band, with a steady stream of live performances and other projects. Dave Slave had been working on an album of electronic rock n&#x27; roll for several years, finally releasing it under the name Digital Fiction in 1998 through a Brisbane distributor called Oracle. Rok also recorded two solo albums, with Osmose releasing the first, This is Satanik in 1998 and Melbourne&#x27;s Modern Invasion Music releasing the second, Burning Metal in the year 2000. Rev. Kriss Hades had now temporarily joined the Sydney black metal band Nazxul, who he recorded and played live with. Sloth also recorded a series of demos, mainly consisting of some of his many punk rock songs under the name Bog.

At the end of 1998, shortly after Rok had performed a solo show, Sadistik Exekution reconvened to play a New Year&#x27;s Eve gig. It was billed as their last show ever, but the band had often advertised their performances this way. However, only months later, in 1999 they took to the stage again at Sydney&#x27;s Globe Theatre in the suburb of Newtown. This time it did end up being the bands last live performance. The band remained dormant for the remainder of the year, as Hades toured with Nazxul and the others concerned themselves with personal projects once more. Kriss Hades also began piecing together several tracks that would eventually make up his solo debut.

The band maintained that it had ended as a live act, but when the line-up for the year 2000 Metal for the Brain festival in Canberra was announced, Sadistik Exekution was billed as one of the headliners. While anticipation among fans was high that the country&#x27;s most notorious metal band was finally making an appearance at Australia&#x27;s biggest metal event, Dave Slave broke his leg in an incident only weeks before the show and the band had to withdraw.

=== Final recordings ===
A further two Sadistik Exekution albums were recorded, the first, &quot;Fukk&quot; released in 2002 and the second, simply called &quot;Fukk II&quot;, appearing 18 months later. Dave Slave has often affirmed that the band is no more, claiming to be busy with his solo act Doomed and Disgusting and other musical pursuits. Kriss Hades has established himself as a solo artist, producing an album of noise and dark ambience in 2002. He also maintains a parallel career as an underground illustration artist. Rok also moved further into the art world and eventually became a highly respected and sought-after illustrator for other heavy metal bands and labels around the world. Sloth distanced himself from the other Sadistik Exekution members. However, he continued to play as a session drummer with various low key rock and metal bands around the local Australian live pub and club circuit.

Sadistik Exekution made a live return in November 2009 as the featured act at the Australian Metal Awards in Sydney. Leading up to the event, Rok was interviewed on radio station JJJ&#x27;s leading heavy metal show &#x27;The Racket&#x27; with Andrew Haug. He spoke at length with Andrew of his many adventures over the years as well as the upcoming live performance. During the interview, Rok made no further comments about Sadistik Exekution recording further albums. Later that month they appeared to a capacity crowd at Sydney&#x27;s Fox Studios for the Australian Heavy Metal awards night, where they were given the final spot for the night.

Despite many invitations to perform at various events and festivals within Australia and Europe over the following years, the band always declined such offers. However, founding members Rok and Dave Slave have continued to work together with post band business activities, including merchandise, label and legal matters.

<text>The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) was a public authority in the UK created by the Radiological Protection Act 1970. Its statutory functions were to conduct research on radiological protection and provide advice and information on the subject to Government Departments and others. It was also authorized to provide technical services and charge for them. Originally NRPB dealt only with ionizing radiation, but its functions were extended in 1974 to non-ionizing radiation.

==Structure==

The Board consisted of a chairman and a maximum of nine other members, later increased to twelve, all appointed by Health Ministers. Throughout its existence, NRPB had 300 members of staff on average. They were located at the headquarters in Chilton near Oxford and at laboratories in Leeds and Glasgow. The Department of Health funded the difference between the cost of NRPB and its income by annual grant.

==Work==

Research on ionizing radiation included: plutonium exposure; internal dosimetry; radioactive discharges; nuclear accidents and wastes; radon hazards; medical x rays; epidemiology and molecular biology. Research on non-ionizing radiation included the physics and biology of exposure to ultraviolet sources, electricity supplies, and mobile phones.

As well as a full range of technical services - from personnel dosimetry to radiation surveys - NRPB also engaged in projects such as: the safe transport of radioactive materials; preparedness for nuclear emergencies; exposure to cosmic rays; optimization of protection; improved radiation instruments; training courses; a wide selection of publications.

Members of staff contributed to major public inquiries about the nuclear industry in the UK and supported the UK response to the Chernobyl disaster. They also participated in the work of the International Commission on Radiological Protection; the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection; the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation; the Nuclear Energy Agency; and various committees of the Commission of the European Communities.

==Transition==

The Health Protection Agency Act 2004 repealed the Radiological Protection Act. On 1 April 2005, NRPB became the Radiation Protection Division of the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Under the terms of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, the HPA was abolished, and responsibility for radiation protection functions was assigned to the Public Health England Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards (CRCE) at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus near Chilton, Oxfordshire.

<text>Stevens Pass (elevation ) is a mountain pass through the Cascade Mountains located at the border of King County and Chelan County in Washington, United States. U.S. Route 2 travels over the pass, reaching a maximum elevation of . The Pacific Crest Trail crosses the highway at Stevens Pass. The BNSF Railway&#x27;s Cascade Tunnel lies below the pass summit.

The pass is near Stevens Pass Ski Area, which is on Cowboy Mountain and Big Chief Mountain.

==History==
Stevens Pass is named after John Frank Stevens, the first non-indigenous person to discover it. Native Americans familiar with the area knew of the pass, although very little is known about Native American routes through the mountains. Hubert C. Ward, exploring the area for the Northern Pacific Railway in 1872, heard from some Native Americans that there was a low pass at the head of Nason Creek, a tributary of the Wenatchee River, which led to one of the sources of the Skykomish River. Albert Bowman Rogers of the Great Northern Railway, learned from Native Americans in 1887 that the Skykomish River and Nason Creek had sources close to one another but that neither natives nor whites visited the Nason Creek area. Neither Ward nor Rogers had time to fully explore the area.

In 1890, Stevens conducted a thorough survey for the Great Northern, located the pass, and determined it to be the best suited for a railway crossing of the North Cascades. He wrote that there was no indication that the pass was used — there was no sign of any trails, blazes, campsites, or old campfires, for at least in either direction and that the area was thickly forested and covered with almost impenetrable brush. Stevens wrote, &quot;the region promised nothing to the prospector, while Indians and Whites crossing the mountains used either Snoqualmie on the south or the Indian Pass on the north.&quot;

Stevens had also charted Marias Pass in northwestern Montana, on the Continental Divide near Glacier National Park.

==Notable avalanches==

On February 23, 1910, the two Great Northern Railway trains, the &quot;Seattle Express&quot; local passenger train No. 25 and Fast Mail train No. 27, were stalled on the tracks at the Cascade Tunnel Station on Stevens Pass because of a heavy snow storm and avalanches. Then on March 1, six days later, another avalanche pushed both trains down into the Tye River Valley, thus burying the train cars in snow and debris. The Wellington Disaster killed ninety-six people – thirty-five passengers and sixty-one railroad employees – which made the Wellington avalanche one of the worst train disasters in United States history.

Over a century later, an avalanche occurred on February 19, 2012 near Tunnel Creek Canyon Road, killing three of four experienced backcountry skiers, including the Stevens Pass Ski Area&#x27;s marketing director. Professional skier Elyse Saugstad, who was wearing an avalanche airbag backpack, survived after tumbling down for more than 2,000 feet (600 m).

==Climate==
Stevens Pass experiences a maritime-influenced alpine subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dsc&quot;), with short, mild, dry summers and extremely heavy winter snowfall.

The following chart includes climate data for the Stevens Pass (SNOTEL) weather station from January 1, 1991, to December 31, 2020.

<text>José de Jesús Arellano Alcocer (born 8 May 1973) is a Mexican former professional footballer who played as a winger and a wanted fugitive. He last played for Monterrey in the Primera División de México.

==Biography==
Arellano, nicknamed &quot;El Cabrito,&quot; is known for his speed, dribbling and passing abilities, Arellano has played an important role for the Mexico national team for many years and has led his country to victories in several occasions. He was one of the players responsible for the erratic comebacks made by Mexico in the World Cup groups stage at France&#x27;98. Known as the &quot;Super-Substitute&quot;, Arellano was brought in the field, in the late stages of the match, by Mexico&#x27;s now retired national coach, Manuel Lapuente and help his country come back from seemingly impossible situations to either draw or win the games.

After his debut with CF Monterrey, he tried his luck with the &quot;All Mexican Team&quot;, Club Deportivo Guadalajara during the 1998 Fall season. However, Arellano found his success with the &quot;Rayados de Monterrey&quot; club, helping them win the 2003 Clausura championship title in the La Primera División.

In the FIFA World Cup in Korea-Japan 2002, Arellano made a less of an impact as a substitute. He was among the starting eleven for three matches, where he helped his country reach the &quot;Elimination Round of 16&quot; of the tournament. In total, he has amassed 70 caps for Mexico, scoring seven times and was among 23 players selected by coach Ricardo La Volpe, to play in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Arellano played one match throughout the tournament and only appeared in the 2nd half as a substitute player in a 0–0 draw, against Angola.

Jesus Arellano is the seventh Mexican player and the first one to be born in Monterrey to play three World Cups: France 98, Korea-Japan 2002 and Germany 2006.

==Rape allegations and arrest==
In January 2017, Arellano was accused of raping his 16 year old niece. The minor had provided testimony to authorities and had undergone physical examinations that prompted an investigation. Arellano was arrested in his home in Monterrey on May 4, 2019, after being on the run for over a year. Arellano was in jail for 5 days before being ordered free by a judge due to lack of sufficient evidence. On December 19, 2019, the case was reopened.

In December 2020, Arellano had only his lawyers present in the court to represent him. Authorities issued an arrest warrant the following month for Arellano. As of April 2022, his whereabouts remain unknown.

<text>The Royal Palace of Aranjuez () is one of the official residences of the Spanish royal family. It is located in the town of Aranjuez (Madrid), Spain. Established in the 16th century as a royal hunting lodge, the palace was built by order of Philip II. Under his reign it became one of four seasonal seats of the court along Rascafría, El Escorial and the Royal Alcázar of Madrid. The royal estate comprises a set of landscaped and ornate gardens and woodlands that house an extensive botanical collection.

Several international treaties were signed there and several members of the royal family died in the palace, including: Elisabeth of Valois in 1568, Barbara of Portugal in 1758, Elisabeth Farnese in 1766, Maria Antonia of Naples in 1806, Maria Isabel of Braganza in 1818 and Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony in 1828.

In 1931, during the Second Spanish Republic, the royal estate was declared an Artistic Historical Monument and opened to the public. From 1977 to 1983, the palace served as a state guest house. The palace, gardens and associated buildings are part of the Aranjuez Cultural Landscape, which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. Currently it houses a museum on the ground floor, the royal rooms and gardens are open to the public and its management is entrusted to the public agency Patrimonio Nacional.

==History==

In the 12th century the Order of Santiago created an exclusive hunting reserve alongside the river Tagus near its junction with the river Jarama.

Its history as a royal site began in the 16th century, when the order&#x27;s grandmaster Lorenzo I Suárez de Figueroa directed the construction of a grand hunting lodge designed for the recreation of members of the order and their royal and noble patrons, known as the Raso de Estrella (Star shaped Glade located between the present Royal Palace and Aranjuez railway station.) The site today is an open festival park.

In 1523 Charles I of Spain took possession of the area, which was designated Real Bosque y Casa de Aranjuez (Royal Woods and House of Aranjuez), in order to entertain his guests during the springtime hunting season.

In 1551, he established a botanical garden to catalog the newly catalogued species of plants brought from the Americas. Owing to distractions elsewhere, this mission was not entirely successful.

Philip II became aware of the fertile meadows of Aranjuez, and designated that a portion of land to the north of the river Tagus should be devoted to pottager and general agriculture in 1561.

In an adjacent plot to the south of the river, the King began construction of the first palace, on the same site as the existing building. Philip engaged the services of architect Juan Bautista de Toledo and later Juan de Herrera. They were also responsible for the palace and monastery of El Escorial.
The site also included exotic animals such as dromedaries ( in the period sources): about 10 in 1583 and about 40 in 1598.

After Philip&#x27;s death in 1598, the works were still in progress with only the royal apartments, the chapel, the south tower and part of the western facade completed. An economic and political crisis, along with eventual extinction of the Spanish Hapsburg dynasty, resulted in the project being abandoned. Prince Charles of England visited the palace in 1623 during his trip to Spain for the &quot;Spanish Match&quot;. 

In 1700, the first Bourbon king of Spain, Philip V, decided to resume the work, intending to make Aranjuez a rival to the grand palace of Versailles. Subsequently, this imposing style would be applied to the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso. Philip V added a new north tower, completed the west façade and defined the structure that would shape the current palace. The royal dromedaries were about 200, surviving even the occupation of the palace by the troops of Archduke Charles in 1710. They were not kept in a menagerie as in Versalles, but grazed around or were employed as beasts of burden. Bulls and exotic animals were also used in the royal pastimes, such as dumping them into the Ontígola reservoir to be shot by the royal musket. Little used, the palace was almost destroyed by fire in 1748.

Ferdinand VI rebuilt the palace. Although still respecting the original foundations, the new structure was to reflect the prevailing late baroque style and 18th century aesthetic, of an imposing and ostentatious exterior accommodating a series of sumptuously furnished spaces within.
Farinelli directed musical entertainment.
The building is mainly due to Charles III in his reforming work for the capital city (he is sometimes called the &quot;Mayor of Madrid&quot;) and modernization of the Spanish state.

The architect of the modern palace was the Italian Francesco Sabatini. He designed the two west wings, which provide the main building enclosing the courtyard, thus defining three sides of the cour d&#x27;honneur square that faces the original entrance. It is near the Raso de Estrella at the confluence of the two rivers. At one end of this complex was the chapel and opposite was designated as a theater, although it was never completed.

The decoration was enriched in the 18th and 19th centuries with paintings by various artists; in the halls hardwood furniture and several collections of tapestries, clocks, lamps and sculptures were installed. Many of these unique pieces adorn the halls, chambers and spaces. The Salón de Porcelana was the favorite retreat of Charles III.

Charles III took refuge there from Spanish politics for some time following the Esquilache Riots. He chose Aranjuez to be his spring and summer residence at a period of history when the royal court used to move from Madrid in the spring and did not return to the capital until October.

The King embraced physiocracy (an early form of economics in which the wealth of a nation supposedly lay in its soil and people rather than its treasury). Charles, who enjoyed the palace and its rural environment, established the Cortijo de San Isidro as an experimental farm and divided the palace gardens into the intimate Jardín del Parterre and the wider Jardín de la Isla. He held lavish parties and sometimes sailed along stretches of the Tagus in rich artistically decorated and gilded .

Charles&#x27; son, Charles IV and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma erected a pavilion known as the Casa del Labrador (farmhouse), which is today open to the public and an important example of European Neoclassical architecture.

In 1807, Manuel Godoy, favorite of Charles IV&#x27;s and Spanish prime minister, tried to make peace with Napoleonic France but faced the opposition of the rebellious heir to the throne Ferdinand (later called the &quot;felon king&quot;). Godoy claimed that the kingdom was safe from the impending Napoleonic French invasion because of the treaties he had facilitated. In 1808, while Godoy was a resident in Aranjuez (within the Palace of Osuna) the rumor of invasion spread, resulting in an angry mob led by the rebellious supporters of Ferdinand finding him hiding in an attic. He was taken prisoner and later exiled. As a result of the successful Mutiny of Aranjuez in March of that year the palace Salón del Trono witnessed the abdication of King Charles IV in favor of his son Ferdinand VII, who himself abdicated in May.

In September 1808, in a formal ceremony held in the Chapel of the Royal Palace of Aranjuez before Monsignor Don Juan de la Vera, the Archbishop of Laodicea, the Supreme, central Junta was officially constituted.

After the Bourbon Restoration, Alfonso XII designated the Royal Palace of Aranjuez to be the residence of the noble household of the dukes of Montpensier. His bride to be was the daughter of that family, Mercedes of Orléans. In 1878 the bride and her entourage arrived for the ceremony from Madrid at an imposing but temporary railway station constructed near the grand Plaza de Armas (western) entrance to the Palace of Aranjuez.

This was the last grand event to be held in Aranjuez, as Maria Christina of Austria the monarch&#x27;s second wife, his son Alfonso XIII and his wife Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg all preferred the Palacio de la Magdalena and Miramar Palace for their royal holidays.

==Design==
The palace is the centerpiece set of a royal estate. To the north are former potager gardens, now agricultural land intersected by geometric tree-lined &quot;royal rides&quot; which are now open to the public and mostly pedestrian walkways. To the east are a trident of paved roads (Reina, Principe &amp; Infantas) along which the nobility erected family residences. To the west are a matching trident of rural tracks, one of which was the royal access road lined by barracks (now ruined). 

Furthest from the palace is an open area, the Raso de Estrella, the site of the original hunting lodge and now a festival ground. The original railway station was also here, before it was relocated further west of the current site. Some of the former railway sidings – now a car park for commuters – are also still discernible. Directly in front of the palace is the oval lawn surrounded by monumental stone benches. The tourist mini-train stop is near there. To the south is the Plaza de Parejas, an open sandy area surrounded by various palace dependencies described below.

===Plaza de Parejas===
The south of the palace is a large open square known as &quot;Plaza de las Parejas&quot; in reference to equestrian events formerly held there. (The nobility competed or paraded in pairs or &quot;parejas&quot;).
It is defined on the east by a Renaissance style two-story building, which was the auxiliary dependence of the palace (Casa de Caballeros y Oficios – now the local law courts and tax offices). To the west a warehouse area, servant halls and (after the fire) a separate kitchen-house (Casa de Fogones). In front – facing the palace (later a hotel) is the Casa del Principe de Paz, intended to be the residence of Manuel Godoy.

The palace consists of two floors. The ground level is lit by windows crowned by semicircular arches, while the upper floor opens onto balconies with iron railings. The central body of the palace rises to a third level surmounted by a pediment bearing the shield of Ferdinand VI. At the sides of the shield are engraved two inscriptions. The left one reads &quot;Philippus II / Institvit / Philippus V / provexit&quot; (initiated by Philip II and continued by Philip V). The right one reads &quot; Ferdinandu / VI Pius Felix / Consummavit / An MDCCLII&quot; (Completed in 1752 by the faithful and devout Ferdinand VI).

===Structure===
The entire structure is built in red brick with white limestone details from Colmenar de Oreja.

===Entrance===
Public access is to the east, via the M-305 road and boat-bridge. For royalty, the traditionally formal access to the Palace is to cross the river Tagus by the (now closed) road to the west near the confluence and then travel eastwards, entering via the Plaza de Armas and through the portico of the central body.

The central rise in the elevation of the building is to emphasise the main portico that is framed by five symmetrical exterior arches. On the ledge are statues carved by Pedro Martinengo portraying Philip II, Philip V and Ferdinand VI.
On either side of the portico, the wings have three grand terminal arches to further emphasise the grandeur of this royal access. Above the portico is a large balcony with stone parapets overlooking the courtyard.

The portico provides access to the interior through a hall that in turn leads to a grand central staircase made by Giacomo Bonavía at the behest of Ferdinand VI. The balustrade is of black iron with gold trim and fits within the Rococo trend. From the ceiling hangs an Empire style large chandelier gilt bronze and crystal from La Granja.

===Interior===
Behind the palace&#x27;s main body is an interior courtyard around which are distributed the various halls. In both corners can be seen two small towers surmounted by domes resting on shallow circular drums with small windows that illuminate the interior, in one of which is set a clock.

The lobby is decorated with sculptures and on the top floor are three marble busts inside alcoves representing Louis XIV of France, his wife Maria Theresa of Spain and their son Louis, the Grand Dauphin. These busts were made in 1683 by French sculptor Antoine Coysevox. The presence of these three French characters in the palace is explained by the connections to the Spanish Royal Bourbon family with the French monarchy and particularly The Grand Dauphin who was the father of Philip V and his parents, the grandparents of Philip.

In almost all halls of are clocks of all sizes and characteristics, as King Charles IV was a collector of clocks and an Horologer.

====Salón de Guardias de la Reina (Space for the guards of the Queen) ====

===Despacho de la Reina (&quot;Queen&#x27;s office&quot;)===
This room was used by Isabel II as an office, after it was a bedroom. Paintings decorate its walls, including the &quot;Vase&quot; by Jan Brueghel the Elder.

A medium-sized hall, its walls and ceilings are completely lined by plaques of white porcelain and reliefs with Rococo decoration of chinoiserie motifs (garlands of flowers, fruits, monkeys, vases, mandarins, parrots, samurais, birds and dragons). The ceramic plaques are attached to timber walls by screws. They were made between 1760 and 1765 by Giuseppe Gricci. The floor is marble. Eight large mirrors against the walls multiply the effect of the decorations. Interspersed with the above-described decoration are human groups in everyday scenes. In the center of the ceiling arises a lamp taking the form of a palm, while a Chinese with a hand fan and a monkey on his shoulders climbs the trunk. The purpose of this room was as a games room and playground.

===Comedor de gala (Formal dining room)===
Formerly a debating chamber during the reign of Ferdinand VI, Charles III used it as a banquet hall for gala occasions, as the palace has several less formal dining rooms. It has a vaulted ceiling painted around 1750 by Jacopo Amigoni with a complicated moralizing symbology. The figure of Father Time is surrounded by women who are trying to clip his wings to prevent time flying away. Truth is portrayed as matron of angels while Wisdom pays her homage. The monarchy is depicted by its positive attributes and virtues (Justice, Religion, Bounty, the Angel of Peace with an olive branch, Faith and Charity as a woman protecting children). There is a series of grisaille representing parts of the world where the Monarchy had its possessions. Occasionally this space was also used as a ballroom. The floor is Rococo style of very good quality, with stucco work by Carlo Antonio Bernasconi, representing military attributes, sheet music and musical instruments.

Work by Rafael Contreras Muñoz, along with the Gabinete de Porcelana, are the two most admired sights. Its furniture consists of a porcelain central table and a bronze and crystal lamp. It was used as a smoking room mainly for men. The decoration of the walls is made of brightly colored plaster work.

<text>Cascade Pass (formerly also known as Skagit Pass) is a mountain pass over the northern Cascade Range, east of Marblemount, Washington, U.S.

Although an important pass, providing the easiest connection from the Cascade River to the head of Lake Chelan, it is now inside North Cascades National Park, and crossed by only a hiking trail.

From the west, one reaches it by hiking an easy 3.5 mile trail from the end of the Cascade River Road (elev. ). From the east, it is accessible via a trail from Stehekin up the Stehekin River valley.

The summit of the pass, being at the tree line, is known for its views in all directions. It is also a key departure point for mountaineering; to the north, the gentle ridge of the Sahale arm leads up Sahale Mountain to the summit, as well as to the meadows of Boston Basin and the summits above. To the south, Mixup Arm leads to Mixup Peak and Magic Mountain, as well as to Cache Col, making Cascade Pass the start of the high-level Ptarmigan Traverse.

The pass was originally a major route for Native Americans trading between the coast and the interior. Among the first white men to explore and map the Skagit Pass was New York newspaperman Frank Wilkeson. Alexander Ross probably crossed the Cascades via Cascade Pass in 1814. His writings are too vague to be certain about his precise route.

<doc id="1257276" wikidata="Q3538509" url="?curid=1257276" title="Feast of the Immaculate Conception">
<text>The Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception celebrates the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary on 8 December, nine months before the feast of the Nativity of Mary on 8 September. It is one of the most important Marian feasts in the liturgical calendar of the Latin Church.

By pontifical decree, it is the patronal feast day of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Italy, Korea, Nicaragua, Paraguay, the Philippines, Spain, the United States, and Uruguay. By royal decree, it is designated as the day honoring the patroness of Portugal.

Since 1953, the Pope visits the Column of the Immaculate Conception in the Piazza di Spagna to offer expiatory prayers commemorating the solemn event.

The feast was solemnized as a holy day of obligation on 6 December 1708, by the papal bull &quot;Commissi Nobis Divinitus&quot; of Pope Clement XI. It is celebrated with Masses, parades, fireworks, processions, food and cultural festivities in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Catholic countries.

==History==

The Eastern Church first celebrated a &quot;Feast of the Conception of the Most Holy and All Pure Mother of God&quot; on 9 December, perhaps as early as the 5th century in Syria. The original title of the feast focused more specifically on Saint Anne, being termed &quot;Sylepsis tes hagias kai theoprometoros Annas&quot; (&quot;conception of Saint Anne, the ancestress of God&quot;). By the 7th century, the feast was already widely known in the East: on at least two occasions in the Acta of the Third Council of Constantinople (680-681), regarded as ecumenical by both the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, Mary is called &quot;immaculate&quot; (&quot;Achrantos&quot;).

Most Orthodox Christians reject the Scholastic definition of Mary&#x27;s preservation from original sin. The feast associated with her immaculate conception, initially celebrated on 8 December, was translated to the Western Church in the 8th century. It then spread from the Byzantine Southern Italy to Normandy during the Norman dominance, eventually reaching England, France, Germany, and Rome.

In 1568, Pope Pius V revised the Roman Breviary, and though the Franciscans were allowed to retain the Office and Mass written by Bernardine dei Busti, this office was suppressed for the rest of the Church, and the office of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin was substituted instead, the word &quot;Conception&quot; being substituted for &quot;Nativity&quot;.

According to the papal bull &quot;Commissi Nobis Divinitus&quot;, dated 6 December 1708, Pope Clement XI mandated the feast as a holy day of obligation which is to be celebrated in future years by the faithful. Furthermore, the pontiff requested that the papal bull be notarized in the Holy See to be further copied and reproduced for dissemination.

Prior to Pope Pius IX&#x27;s definition of the Immaculate Conception as a Catholic dogma in 1854, most missals referred to it as the Feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The festal texts of this period focused more on the action of her conception than on the theological question of her preservation from original sin. A missal published in England in 1806 indicates the same collect for the feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary was used for this feast as well.

The first move towards describing Mary&#x27;s conception as &quot;immaculate&quot; came in the 11th century. In the 15th century, Pope Sixtus IV, while promoting the festival, explicitly tolerated both the views of those who promoted it as the Immaculate Conception and those who challenged such a description, a position later endorsed by the Council of Trent.

The proper for the feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the medieval Sarum missal merely addresses the fact of her conception. The collect for the feast reads:
O God, mercifully hear the supplication of thy servants who are assembled together on the Conception of the Virgin Mother of God, may at her intercession be delivered by Thee from dangers which beset us.

==Latin Church==

Pope Pius IX on 8 December 1854 issued the apostolic constitution &quot;Ineffabilis Deus&quot;:

According to the &quot;Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar&quot;, the solemnity of the Immaculate Conception cannot replace an Advent Sunday; if 8 December falls on a Sunday, the solemnity is transferred to the following Monday (9 December). The 1960 Code of Rubrics, still observed by some in accordance with &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;, gives the feast of the Immaculate Conception preference even over an Advent Sunday.

When the feast is celebrated on 9 December, the obligation to attend Mass did not also transfer in some countries, but in 2024 the Holy See issued a clarification that the obligation is transferred to the day when it is observed.

==Anglican Communion==
In the Church of England, the &quot;Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot; may be observed as a Lesser Festival on 8 December without the religious designation as &quot;sinless&quot;, &quot;most pure&quot; or &quot;immaculate&quot;.

The situation in other constituent churches of the Anglican Communion is similar, i.e., as a lesser commemoration.

==Oriental Orthodoxy==
The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on Nehasie 7 (August 13). The 96th chapter of the Kebra Nagast states: &quot;He cleansed Eve&#x27;s body and sanctified it and made for it a dwelling in her for Adam&#x27;s salvation. Mary was born without blemish, for He made Her pure, without pollution&quot;.

==Eastern Orthodoxy==

The Eastern Orthodox Churches does not accept the Catholic dogma of the Immaculate Conception. Accordingly, they celebrate 9 December called the “Feast of the Conception by Saint Anne of the Most Holy Theotokos”.

While the Orthodox believe that the Virgin Mary was, from her conception, filled with every grace of the Holy Spirit, in view of her calling as the Mother of God, they do not teach that she was conceived without original sin as their understanding and terminology of the doctrine of original sin differs from the Catholic articulation. The Orthodox do, however, affirm that Mary is &quot;all-holy&quot; and never committed a personal sin during her lifetime.

The Orthodox feast is not a perfect nine months before the feast of the Nativity of the Theotokos (8 September) as it is in the West, but a day later. This feast is not ranked among the Great Feasts of the church year, but is a lesser-ranking feast (Polyeleos).

==Church of the Company Fire==

The Church of the Company Fire is a major mass casualty incident that occurred during the celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception in Santiago, Chile; on December 8, 1863. A fire broke out at the start of a Mass that was being held at the Church of the Company of Jesus in honour of this feast day. Between 2,000 and 3,000 churchgoers (mostly women) were killed during the fire, a number which represented approximately 2% of the total population of Santiago at the time according to subsequent estimates. A combination of organisational negligence, overcrowding, mass panic and a highly flammable indoor environment led to a rapidly spreading fire that consumed the church within one hour. Only a relatively small number of people were able to escape. This tragedy is considered one of the largest single building fires by number of victims in the world.

<doc id="1257278" wikidata="Q7728007" url="?curid=1257278" title="The Credibility Gap">
<text>The Credibility Gap was an American satirical comedy team active from 1968 through 1979. They emerged in the late 1960s delivering comedic commentary on the news for the Los Angeles AM rock radio station KRLA 1110, and proceeded to develop more elaborate and ambitious satirical routines on the &quot;underground&quot; station KPPC-FM in Pasadena, California. Richard Beebe&#x27;s wife Heidi came up with the name &quot;The Credibility Gap&quot; due to the news being published that seemed to have gaps.

Founded as a loose collective centered on KRLA staff members Lew Irwin, John Gilliland, Thom Beck, Richard Beebe, and folk singer Len Chandler, the group is chiefly remembered today for its 1971–79 lineup, comprising Beebe (though early 1975), Harry Shearer, David L. Lander and Michael McKean. 

== History ==

=== Lew Irwin and The Credibility Gap ===
The Credibility Gap grew out of a company formed by Lew Irwin and Cliff Vaughs. KRLA 1110 hired news director Irwin to form The Credibility Gap in 1968 with his radio colleagues John Gilliland, Thom Beck, Richard Beebe, and folk singer Len Chandler. They took their name from the Vietnam-era term &quot;credibility gap&quot; (a euphemism for political dishonesty), and broadcast their comedy along with the news on KRLA.
 They first aired on the date of the 1968 California Primary. In 1968 (billed as &quot;Lew Irwin and The Credibility Gap&quot;) they released &quot;An Album Of Political Pornography&quot; for Blue Thumb, consisting of highlights from their radio sketches. Thom Beck left in late 1968, and was replaced by Harry Shearer. Lew Irwin left a few months later, replaced by David L. Lander in February, 1969.

=== The Credibility Gap ===

In 1969, The Credibility Gap performed on KRLA&#x27;s Pop Chronicles music documentary series. By this point, Gilliland and Chandler had left, to be replaced by Bob Goodwin. This left Beebe the only original professional news member remaining. A Pasadena Playhouse Theatre alumnus, Beebe&#x27;s booming radio voice and quick improv helped The Credibility Gap make some of the most original comedy of their time. Goodwin stayed with the group for about a year, but by late 1970, the Credibility Gap consisted of Beebe, Shearer, McKean and Lander.

KRLA dropped The Credibility Gap&#x27;s show in 1970, but Shearer found work as a disc jockey on freeform station KPPC and The Credibility Gap continued their on-air performances there. In 1971, the trio released the album &quot;Woodschtick&quot;, consisting of two long pieces that were somewhat in the style of The Firesign Theatre. Also writing and performing on the album was Michael McKean, who would be promoted to full membership after the album&#x27;s release. Guest performers Christopher Ross, Morgan Upton and Albert Brooks would also work with the group during this era. Mark Deming writes of this transition:
[I]n late 1968, Thom Beck left the group, and Lew Irwin followed in early 1969 ... . Joining the Credibility Gap in their absence were Harry Shearer ... and David L. Lander... . By 1970, Len Chandler and John Gilliland had drifted away from the Credibility Gap, and ... Michael McKean, had joined the team, though the troupe&#x27;s relationship with KRLA had soured and their show had been shrunk from 15 minutes to a mere 180 seconds. However, after Shearer landed a side gig as a disc jockey on an FM &quot;free form&quot; outlet, KPPC, the Credibility Gap found a new home on the station, and the group&#x27;s satire gained both sharpness and depth. 

KPPC-FM fired all of its airstaff, including the members of The Credibility Gap, as part of a mass format change in 1971. No longer radio regulars, the group started performing in various clubs and concert venues. They also returned to the studio in 1972 to record a promo-only single for Warner Brothers, a four-and-a-half minute mini mock-rock opera called &quot;Something for Mary&quot;.

The Credibility Gap followed up this recording with the 1974 album &quot;A Great Gift Idea&quot;, which mixed satirical sketches with musical parodies. McKean and Shearer played guitar and keyboards, respectively, on the album, augmented by members of the band Little Feat.

Beebe left the Gap in 1975 to join Los Angeles FM rock station KMET, remaining in radio news for over 40 years with 2 Golden Mic awards. The Credibility Gap continued as a trio (Lander, McKean and Shearer) through 1979, but after 1976 individual members tended to focus on other projects and the group itself made only sporadic, widely spaced appearances. McKean and Lander &quot;moonlighted&quot; by performing at the &quot;Pitschel Players Cabaret&quot;. McKean and Lander landed roles on the television series &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; that lasted from 1976 through 1983; Shearer worked as a consultant for the TV series &quot;Fernwood 2-Night&quot;, as well as co-writing comedy albums and the 1979 feature film &quot;Real Life&quot; with Albert Brooks. The Credibility Gap issued a single (&quot;The Day the Lights Stayed on in Pittsburgh&quot;) in 1977, appeared as sketch performers (performing their own material) in the low-budget 1977 film &quot;Cracking Up&quot;, and continued their New Year&#x27;s Day Rose Parade broadcasts (which started in the mid-1970s) annually through January 1, 1979. Highlights of the parade broadcasts were collected on the 1979 album &quot;Floats&quot;. As well, selections from their earlier radio material were compiled on 1977&#x27;s &quot;The Bronze Age of Radio&quot;.

Shearer became a writer/performer on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in September, 1979. This necessitated Shearer&#x27;s move to New York and essentially brought The Credibility Gap&#x27;s activities to a close.

=== After The Credibility Gap ===
The group disbanded in 1979, but the members have occasionally worked together since, most notably the pairings of McKean and Lander as Lenny and Squiggy on the situation comedy &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; (recording an album in character as &quot;Lenny and the Squigtones&quot;) and Shearer and McKean as members of the mock-rock band Spinal Tap. In 1998, Richard Beebe passed; the following year, the remaining Gap members held a reunion at the Museum of Television and Radio in honor of Beebe. Beebe&#x27;s family, in Richard&#x27;s absence, donated all original Gap recordings from 1968-1972 to the Paley Center.

<text>Strike Fighter Squadron 37 (VFA-37), also known as the &quot;Ragin&#x27; Bulls&quot;, is a United States Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter squadron stationed at Naval Air Station Oceana. They are a part of Carrier Air Wing 8 (CVW-8) and are attached to . Their radio callsign is &quot;Ragin″&quot; and their tail code is AJ.

==Squadron insignia and nickname==
The squadron&#x27;s initial insignia was approved by CNO on 26 March 1968. The design centered on a bull was selected to symbolize the spirit, pride and mission of the unit. The original insignia was designed and drawn in house after suggestions from VA-37&#x27;s first Commanding Officer - Cdr Burnett. The design drawn by the squadrons Maintenance Office AZ3 L.A. Smith. Little was changed from submission to CNO approval. The &quot;Bulls&quot; current insignia was based on the Schlitz Malt Liquor logo. Over the years, the size of the testicles has been changed several times. After the Tailhook scandal, the testicles were removed completely from the logo for a time.

==History==
===1960s===

VA-37 was established as an A-7 Corsair II squadron on 1 July 1966. After training with VA-174 in the operation of the A-7 from July–November 1967, VA-37 became operational in 1967, deploying aboard .

===1970s===

In September 1970, VA-37 was embarked on when fighting erupted between Palestinian forces and the Jordanian Army, and was directed to operate in the eastern Mediterranean in response to this crisis. On 29 September 1970, VA-37 participated in an air power demonstration for President Richard Nixon during his two-day visit to USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; while she steamed in the Mediterranean. From June to October 1971, VA-37 participated in the test and evaluation of the new CV concept during USS &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s deployment to the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. The CV concept involved combining the capabilities of the attack and antisubmarine carriers (CVA and CVS) into a single ship.

The squadron deployed twice to Yankee Station in support of combat operations during the Vietnam War. On 1 August 1972, a squadron A-7A was used to establish a sonobuoy field in an anchorage area near the island of Hon Nieu, off the coast of North Vietnam - the first time an A-7 had ever been used to drop sonobuoys.

In 1973, the squadron received their first A-7E, a more advanced version of the plane. They made seven cruises with this plane in the 1970s and early 1980s, including responding to regional crises in the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean.

===1980s===
On 4 January , with VA-37 embarked as part of Carrier Air Wing Three, deployed from Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia for a seven-month cruise that saw USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; sail to the Arabian Sea via the Mediterranean Sea and Suez Canal. During this time port visits took place in St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands, and Malaga, Spain. During their time operating in the Arabian Sea, VA-37 and USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; conducted port visits at Perth, Australia and Mombasa, Kenya, before, in June 1982, taking station off the coast of Lebanon after the Israeli invasion. After leaving the area another port visit took place in Toulon, France, before returning home on 14 July 1982.

From 1 October 1982 VA-37 became part of Carrier Air Wing Fifteen (CVW-15) and in January 1983 as part of CVW-15 they embarked on board the then newest Navy carrier, .

VA-37 headed to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto Rico in August 1942 for exercises with the destroyer , which was the test platform for the development of the CG/SM-2 (ER) missile program project.

On 1 March VA-37 sailed with CVW-15 and USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; on an eight-month would cruise that saw them operate in the Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, South China Sea, and Pacific Ocean in a multitude of exercises and with port visits in Monte Carlo, Monaco, Casablanca, Morocco, Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Perth, Australia, Subic Bay, Philippines, Hong Kong, Sasebo, Japan, Pusan, Republic of Korea, and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before returning to NAS Cecil Field in Florida on 29 October 1983.

In June 1984, the squadron&#x27;s primary mission was changed to close air support in preparation for its deployment to MCAS Iwakuni as part of the Marine Corps Unit Deployment Program. The deployment of the two Navy attack squadrons was designed to test the interoperability of the Marine Corps and Navy.

In December 1984, VA-37 deployed to MCAS Iwakuni and relieved VFA-105. While deployed to Iwakuni, the squadron was detached to Yechon, Korea, to participate in exercise Team Spirit 85. This was the first time a Navy carrier-based squadron had deployed in field conditions since World War II.

In April 1988, VA-37 deployed with Carrier Air Wing Six (CVW-6) on board to the North Arabian Sea via the Suez Canal in support of Operation Earnest Will. The squadron spent 108 consecutive days at sea before USS &quot;Forrestal&quot; anchored at its first liberty port, Naples, Italy.

===1990s===

During the 1990s, the squadron deployed aboard USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, , , and .

Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, several squadron aircraft were deployed with VA-72 in support of Operation Desert Shield.

On 31 October 1990, the squadron flew their last official sortie in the A-7E Corsair II. This ended a 25-year association in which over 115,000 flight hours and 25,000 arrestments were flown. On 28 November 1990, VA-37 was redesignated Strike Fight Squadron Thirty Seven (VFA-37) and began flying the F/A-18 Hornet. From October 1992 to April 1993, VFA-37 deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and participated in Operation Provide Comfort in northern Iraq and Operation Provide Promise in the airspace near the former Yugoslavia.

In 1994 the squadron flew missions over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch (OSW) and later over Bosnia in support of Operation Deny Flight. The squadron also participated in major exercises with the Kuwaitis, Saudis, and Israelis, as well as with many NATO allies.

In November 1996, the squadron flew in support of Operation Southern Watch and Operation Deliberate Guard over Bosnia-Herzegovina.

VFA-37 deployed again in November 1998. After four weeks of participating in OSW, the order was issued for Operation Desert Fox in Iraq. They also flew missions over the former Yugoslavia in Operation Deliberate Force.

The squadron relocated from Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida, to NAS Oceana, Virginia in July 1999.

===21st century===
The next major deployment for VFA-37 was the maiden voyage of in 2000. In December 2002 VFA-37 deployed for their second cruise aboard &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot;. On 19 March 2003, the squadron participated in combat operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). While flying from the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the squadron participated in the &quot;shock and awe&quot; campaign in Southern Iraq before shifting focus to assisting U.S. Forces in Northern Iraq. By the end of a successful 30-day air campaign in OIF, the squadron had flown 252 combat sorties over Iraq. The squadron returned to NAS Oceana on Memorial Day 2003.

VFA-37 deployed to the Persian Gulf and flew combat missions in support of Iraqi Freedom again from October 2004 to April 2005 from USS &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot;. In the spring of 2006, VFA-37 transferred to Carrier Air Wing Eight (CVW-8) for seven months to cover for VFA-213 as they transitioned to the F/A-18F.

The squadron deployed on USS &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; in November 2007 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, returning to MAS Oceana on 4 June 2008. While deployed, they dropped a total of 10 t (22,000 lb) of ordnance.

VFA-37 again deployed on board USS &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; to the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean from 21 May to 20 December 2010 and from 22 July 2013 to 18 April 2014.

In 2016, VFA-37 was reassigned to CVW-8. The wing is assigned to and deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean from 21 January to 21 August 2017.

In July 2018, VFA-37 retired the last F/A-18C Hornet and transitioned to the F/A-18E Super Hornet.

<text>Ludwig Michael Schwanthaler, later ennobled as Ritter von Schwanthaler (26 August 1802 – 14 November 1848), was a German sculptor who taught at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.

==Biography==
Schwanthaler was born in Munich.

His family had been sculptors in Tyrol and Innviertel for three centuries; young Ludwig received his earliest lessons from his father, Franz Schwanthaler (1762–1820), and the father had been instructed by the grandfather. The last to bear the name was Xaver, who worked in his cousin Ludwig&#x27;s studio and survived till 1854. For successive generations the family lived by the carving of busts and sepulchral monuments, and from the condition of craftsmen rose to that of artists.

From the Munich &quot;Gymnasium&quot; Schwanthaler passed as a student to the Munich Academy; at first he purposed to be a painter, but afterwards reverted to the sculptural arts of his ancestors. His talents received timely encouragement by a commission for an elaborate silver service for the king&#x27;s table. Peter von Cornelius also befriended him; the great painter was occupied on designs for the decoration in fresco of the newly erected Glyptothek, and at his suggestion Schwanthaler was employed on the sculpture within the halls.

Thus arose between painting, sculpture, and architecture that union and mutual support which characterized the revival of the arts in Bavaria. Schwanthaler in 1826 went as a pensioner of the king to Rome, where he carried out a number of commissions, and on a second visit in 1832 Bertel Thorvaldsen gave him kindly help. His skill was so developed that on his return he was able to meet the extraordinary demand for sculpture occasioned by King Ludwig&#x27;s passion for building new palaces, churches, galleries, and museums, and he became the fellow-worker of the architects Leo von Klenze, Friedrich von Gartner and Joseph Daniel Ohlmüller, and of the painters Cornelius, Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld and Karl Hess.

Owing to the magnitude and multitude of the sculptural commissions they turned out, over-pressure and haste in design and workmanship brought down the quality of the art. The works of Schwanthaler in Munich are so many and miscellaneous that they can only be briefly indicated. The Neues Palais is peopled with his statues: the throne-room has twelve imposing gilt bronze figures 10 feet high; the same palace is also enriched with a frieze and with sundry other decorations modelled and painted from his drawings. The sculptor, like his contemporary painters, received help from trained pupils, one of whom, Anton Dominik Fernkorn, went on to have a very successful career in Vienna. The same prolific artist also furnished Munich&#x27;s Alte Pinakothek with twenty-five marbles commemorating great painters; likewise he supplied a composition for the pediment of the exhibition building facing the Glyptothek, and executed sundry figures for the public library and the hall of the marshals.

Sacred art lay outside his ordinary routine, yet in the churches of St Ludwig and St Mariahilf he gave proof of the widest versatility. The Ruhmeshalle afforded further gauge of unexampled power of production; here alone is work which, if adequately studied, might have occupied a lifetime; ninety-two metopes, and, conspicuously, the colossal but feeble figure of Bavaria, 60 ft. high, rank among the boldest experiments. A short life of forty-six years did not permit serious undertakings beyond the Bavarian capital, yet time was found for the groups within the north pediment of the Walhalla, Regensburg, and also for numerous portrait statues, including those of Mozart, Jean Paul, Goethe and Shakespeare.

Schwanthaler died in Munich in 1848, and willed to the Munich Academy all his models and studies, which formed the Schwanthaler Museum. He is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.

<text>Feteira is a rural civil parish in the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 1,239, in an area of .

==History==
During the settlement of the island (between the 15th and 16th century), the region of Feteiras was a frontier area, between various jurisdictions, including captaincies and municipalities. The first settlement was the ecclesiastical parish of Santa Ana da Porta Alegre, created by the first colonists to venture east of Pico da D. Joana, and later, when that settlement lost its influence, it was absorbed into the parish of Vila de São Sebastião. With the restructuring of parishes and municipalities, that resulted in a densification of settlements during the first half of the 16th century, the region was integrated into the parish of São Pedro da Ribeirinha, until it became an independent parish on 30 November 1906.

During the captaincy period, delimited in 1474 between Angra and Praia, the southern coast was fixed at the old geodesic mark, that followed the eastern edge of the volcanic tailings in Feteira. That way, the limit coincided with the parish of Ribeirinha (until 1906) and the territory was part of Angra. Many of the references to &quot;Marco&quot; refers to the diverse points in the parish, that &quot;marked&quot; and demarcated the captaincy&#x27;s boundaries. This situation changed in 1565, when experienced geographers through a 1565 accord of the &quot;Tribunal da Relação da Corte&quot; (who had long opposed the Donatary-Captains Antão Martins and Manuel Corte-Real), advanced the boundary to the west, to follow the actual &quot;Canada do Marco&quot;. The final demarcation was concluded on 8 July 1565, and put an end to quarrels that had been raging since 1525, over the limits of Altares. By consequence, the eastern edge of the parish, between &quot;Canada dos Clérigos&quot; and &quot;Canada do Marco&quot;, that included the Ponta Nova bridge, became the responsibility of the Captaincy of Praia, while the eastern frontier, from &quot;Canada do Marco&quot; until &quot;Ladeira Grande&quot;, became part of the captaincy of Angra. Yet, this decision was not peaceful, and required the intervention of the Crown, who established a geodesic mark along &quot;Canada do Marco&quot;.

The parish of Ribeirinha was part of the city of Angra, and by extension, a curato of the parish of São Sebastião. By 1568, the parish of São Pedro da Ribeirinha was already created, and included the territory of Feteira. In this context, when they structured the municipalities of Terceira, the limit of Ribeirinha, which extended to the edge of the volcanic fields of Feteira, began to be the border between Angra and São Sebastião. The area east of the volcanic fields, between &quot;Canada do Marco&quot; and the parish limits, was part of the region of Porto Judeu (and by extension the municipality of Vila de São Sebastião). This explains the successive changes east of the parish, that occurred between 1911 and 1928.

Located on the peripheral area, with little potable water, the settlement was late in developing and, then, slow to grow. The original settlement developed from the small nuclei that sprang around the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Mercês, a small temple constructed at the top of &quot;Caminho das Vinhas&quot;. Yet, at the beginning of the 18th century, two centuries and a half after its settlement, only included six permanent residences. That hermitage, which maintained its architectural design, was constructed in 1590, through the initiative of Father Manuel Martins Coelho Baião, then vicar of the parish of Ribeirinha, whose territory included Feteira. The locality included few residents, and the priest constructed the hermitage at his own expense, to celebrated mass during the period of grape cultivation and winemaking, and included an improvised building so that the priest could overnight during the harvest. The selection of the invocation, to Our Lady of Mercy, originated in Spain, and was popularized by the monks of the Order of Our Lady of Mercy, founded by São Pedro Nolasco. The image was considered a protector of captive Christians in North Africa, and specifically to those captured by Saracen raiders. The invocation was also a patron of various brotherhoods, formed by slaves, who considered the image as vestige of liberation.

Without any consistent source of potable water, the area continued to be sparsely populated until the beginning of the 19th century, when the expansion of cistern construction, growth in the winemaking industry and the opening of the &quot;Royal Roadway&quot; facilities the settlement of families and the place began to take on a life of its own. At this time, the hermitage, which became the property of the Toste Parreira family, became the centre of village life and embryo for the parish of Feteira.

On 10 September 1863 Feteira was elevated to the status of suffrage of the parish of São Pedro da Ribeirinha, transforming the small hermitage into local cult. At the time there were 300 permanent inhabitants. It first cura was Father Domingos Correia de Ávila. The hermitage, which was owned by Inácio Toste Parreira, was too small install the Holy Sacrament, meaning the parish of Ribeirinha still retained its importance. As a consequence, after its elevation, there was an upswell of interest in constructing a new church of adequate dimensions, therein the intention to expand the hermitage. Yet, the property owner opposed the idea, and did not cede any land for its construction. Following his obstruction, the townsfolk decided to construct the new temple along the Royal Road linking Angra and Vila de São Sebastião, along the &quot;Caminho das Vinhas&quot; (today &quot;Canada das Mercês&quot;).

As a consequence of this decision, the new Church of Nossa Senhora da Consolação was inaugurated in 1868, and the hermitage began to be the responsibility of its property owners. The change in patron came from Inácio Toste Parreira, who did not permit the transference of the image of Our Lady of Mercy to the new church. At the time of its inauguration, therefore, Maria Luísa Guedes Sampaio (widow of Diogo Labatt) donated the image of Our Lady of Consolation. Consequently, the church obtain its patron, while the ecclesiastical parish retained the Nossa Senhora das Mercês, since the Vatican did not authorize the change. The Church of Nossa Senhora da Consolação was officially inaugurated on 20 May 1968, but had to be repaired after damage from the 1980 earthquake.

There were approximately 403 homes in 1991.

==Geography==

The rural parish is located from the municipal seat of Angra do Heroísmo. The geographic limits of the parish include the parish of Porto Judeu (to the east), Ribeirinha (to the north and west), while it fronts the Atlantic Ocean (to the south). It contains the localities Fajã da Lajinha, Feteira, Nossa Senhora da Esperança, Nossa Senhora dos Mercês, Outeiro and Serretinha.

Although the population has decreased, current statistics indicate a leveling of out-migration.

==Architecture==
The traditional architecture of Doze Ribeiras resembles much of the rural homes of the western Terceira region, generally constructed around a single floor, many white-washed homes, bordered by multi-coloured trim at the corners, doors and windows.

<doc id="1257320" wikidata="Q4716989" url="?curid=1257320" title="Alex Fernandes (footballer, born 1973)">
<text>Alexsandro Fernandes Xavier (born April 4, 1973 in Recife, Brazil), often known simply as Alex Fernandes, is a former Brazilian football striker.

==Club career==
Before coming to Mexico, Fernandes played for Brazilian clubs Sport Recife, Náutico, and Mogi Mirim.

===Monarcas Morelia===
He joined the Primera División for the 1999 Winter season, debuting for Monarcas Morelia. He would remain with Morelia through the 2002 Apertura, when he was transferred to Monterrey.

Fernandes made a strong debut in Mexico, scoring seven goals in 19 games in the 1999 Invierno, and another nine in the Verano. In total, he scored 72 goals for Morelia in his four years there, including 15 in the 2002 Apertura before his transfer to Monterrey.

===Monterrey===
Alex began promisingly with Monterrey as well, scoring 9 goals in 24 games in the 2003 Clausura, and another 11 goals in the Apertura. In that season CF Monterrey, managed by Daniel Passarella, won the Clausura 2003 Championship, and Alex, as well as his teammates, played a key role in the team through the whole season. However, his form dipped in 2004, as he only made nine appearances in the 2004 Clausura, scoring six goals, and only four in the 2004 Apertura, scoring none.

In the Clausura 2005, Alex participation again diminished because of several injuries, but by the Apertura 2005 he was ready to reappear and his goals along with Guillermo Franco&#x27;s led the team to the Finals. Although he didn&#x27;t play the Finale against Toluca, because of an injury during the Semifinals against archrival Tigres, Alex is widely recognized as being part of the team&#x27;s success and effectiveness during that season.

This would be Alex&#x27;s last tournament until the Apertura 2007 when, after a break from the soccer fields, he returned to CF Monterrey with renewed expectations and hoping to exceed the effectiveness he achieved along with former teammate Guillermo Franco. But once that season ended, in December 2007, Alex finally decided to retire from the soccer fields once and for all.

Alex leaves a decent history in football, including successful performances in several clubs in Brazil and Mexico, but especially in Mexico where he was recognized as an excellent striker and for winning a championship with both of his teams, Monarcas Morelia in Winter 2000 and CF Monterrey in Clausura 2003.

<text>The Grandes Jorasses (; 4,208 m; 13,806 ft) is a mountain in the Mont Blanc massif, on the boundary between Haute-Savoie in France and Aosta Valley in Italy.

The first ascent of the highest peak of the mountain (&quot;Pointe Walker&quot;) was by Horace Walker with guides Melchior Anderegg, Johann Jaun and Julien Grange on 30 June 1868. The second-highest peak on the mountain (&quot;Pointe Whymper&quot;, 4,184 m; 13,727 ft) was first climbed by Edward Whymper, Christian Almer, Michel Croz and Franz Biner on 24 June 1865, using what has become the normal route of ascent and the one followed by Walker&#x27;s party in 1868.

==Geography==
The summits on the mountain (from east to west) are:
* &quot;Pointe Walker&quot; (4,208 m; 13,806 ft) – named after Horace Walker, who made the first ascent of the mountain
* &quot;Pointe Whymper&quot; (4,184 m; 13,727 ft) – named after Edward Whymper, who made the first ascent of this, the second-highest summit 
* &quot;Pointe Croz&quot; (4,110 m; 13,484 ft) – named after Michel Croz, a guide from Chamonix
* &quot;Pointe Hélène&quot; (4,045 m; 13,271 ft) – named after Princess Elena
* &quot;Pointe Marguerite&quot; (4,065 m; 13,337) – named after Queen Margherita
* &quot;Pointe Young&quot; (3,996 m; 13,110 ft) – named after Geoffrey Winthrop Young

==North face==
Located on the French side of the mountain, the north face is one of the three great north faces of the Alps, along with the north faces of the Eiger and the Matterhorn (known as &#x27;the Trilogy&#x27;). One of the most famous walls in the Alps, it towers 1200 m (3,900 ft) above the Leschaux Glacier, stretching 1 km from end to end. The classic route on the face is the Walker Spur (Cassin/Esposito/Tizzoni, 1938, TD+/ED1, IV, 5c/6a, A1, 1200 m) which leads directly to the summit of Pointe Walker. The other major buttress on the mountain is the Croz Spur, which leads to the summit of &quot;Pointe Croz&quot;. In her solo ascents of the six most difficult north faces of the Alps, Alison Hargreaves chose this route in preference to the Walker Spur.

Reinhold Messner has stated, that he made the decision to ascend Mount Everest with Peter Habeler in the Grandes Jorasses, where Peter &quot;descended like a dancer&quot;.

==South face==
On the Italian side of the mountain, the south face can be accessed from the Boccalatte cabin, above the hamlet of Planpincieux in the Italian Val Ferret, part of the Courmayeur municipality.

==Summit ridge==
From the Col des Hirondelles, the summit ridge connects Pt. Walker to the other summit points and then descends to the Col des Grandes Jorasses where a bivouac shelter is located - the Bivouac E Canzio hut. The ridge forms the French-Italian border, almost all of which is above 4,000 m (13,000 ft).

<text>Unsane is an American noise rock trio that was formed in New York City in 1988. Its music touches on elements of hardcore punk and metal. The writer Patrick Kennedy wrote, &quot;While developing the blueprint for noise-metal bands to follow, Unsane cut a remarkable swath through underground music, inspiring a devoted, cult-like following around the world.&quot;

==History==

In 1988, the singer/guitarist Chris Spencer, bass guitarist Pete Shore and drummer Charlie Ondras were students at Sarah Lawrence College when they formed Lawn-Chair-Blisters before changing the name to Unsane. The band signed to Circuit Records and recorded tracks with Wharton Tiers for what was supposed to be their first album &quot;Improvised Munitions&quot;, but the label did not release it.

Unsane became part of the scene of loud, noisy, like-minded rock groups in New York City&#x27;s East Village in the early 1990s. They often played gigs with bands like Pussy Galore, Cop Shoot Cop, Surgery, Helmet and the Reverb Motherfuckers. Members of Unsane also played in other bands such as Boss Hog and the Action Swingers.

The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Unsane&quot;, was released in 1991, and was known for its harsh music and gruesome cover art with a photo of a decapitated man on a New York subway track wearing a Members Only jacket. The band obtained this photograph from a friend who was working at the time with the police department, which was investigating the scene of the accident.

In 1992, Ondras died of a heroin overdose and was replaced by Vincent Signorelli (formerly of Foetus and Swans). In 1994, Shore left the band for unknown reasons and was replaced by Dave Curran.

The band toured heavily, and released &quot;Total Destruction&quot; in 1993 on Matador Records/Atlantic Records. Their third album, &quot;Scattered, Smothered &amp; Covered&quot;, was issued by Amphetamine Reptile in 1995. The music video for the song &quot;Scrape&quot;, made for a mere $200, had significant play on MTV. The video alternates between lo-fi rehearsal footage of Unsane and a series of serious skateboarding wipeouts.

The band continued touring heavily (including a spell opening for Slayer). Their next album, &quot;Occupational Hazard&quot;, was released by Relapse Records in 1998. Later that same year, Spencer was attacked by four people after playing a concert in Vienna, Austria. He was hospitalized with internal bleeding and underwent major surgery. As a result of his injury, and having toured over ten months of the year, the band decided to take a long break in 2000.

Unsane regrouped in 2003 and released the CD/DVD compilation &quot;&quot; the same year. This was followed by their fifth album, &quot;Blood Run&quot;, in 2005. Ipecac released the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Visqueen&quot;, in 2007.

Their song &quot;Committed&quot; was used in the Activision/Neversoft video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot;. Another Activision title, &quot;True Crime: New York City&quot;, uses the song &quot;D Train&quot;.

Unsane released their seventh album &quot;Wreck&quot; on March 20, 2012, and toured with Melvins in April and May that year.

Unsane released their eighth studio album &quot;Sterilize&quot; on September 29, 2017.

In 2019, Spencer announced the formation of a new band, Human Impact, with ex-Swans members Phil Puleo and Chris Pravdica. Spencer subsequently announced his departure from Unsane in August 2019, first in an interview about Human Impact with the Italian-language music zine &quot;Equilibrio Precario&quot;, and then in English in a comment on a Facebook post of the same article.

In early 2021, Unsane released &quot;Improvised Munitions&quot;. It was originally envisioned as the band&#x27;s debut album in 1989, but the band&#x27;s former label shutdown prior to its release. On August 27, 2021, Chris Spencer announced the formation of a new lineup of Unsane via the band&#x27;s Instagram page, alongside new members Eric Cooper and Jon Syverson, with the specific focus on performing the band&#x27;s early material.

==Activities outside the band==
During the band&#x27;s break between 2000 and 2003, Spencer moved to California where he formed a new band with Curran called The Cutthroats 9 and released an album on Man&#x27;s Ruin Records. Curran formed J.J. Paradise Players Club and Signorelli opened a tattoo shop in Middle Village Queens.

Signorelli later formed A Storm of Light with Josh Graham (Neurosis, ex-Red Sparowes, Battle of Mice, Blood and Time) on guitar and vocals, Domenic Seita (ex-Tombs and Asea) on bass guitar, and Pete Angevine (Satanized) on additional drums and percussion. A Storm of Light spent most of the spring touring with Neurosis and they released their first album in 2008.

In 2008 Spencer formed the band Celan with Ari Benjamin Meyers (Redux Orchestra), Niko Wenner (Oxbow), Roeder and Xavi (both ex-flu-ID) and, in 2009, they released the well-reviewed album &quot;Halo&quot; on the Berlin label Exile on Mainstream Records and toured Europe. Spencer now plays in noise rock band, Human Impact.

In 2015 Spencer formed UXO with Steve Austin of Today is the Day, Aarne Victorine, and Pat Kennedy. The band released its self-titled album in 2016 on Reptilian Records.

In 2019 Spencer formed Human Impact with ex-members of Swans and Cop Shoot Cop and confirmed his departure from Unsane.

<text>Danilo Elvis Turcios Funez (born 8 May 1978) is a Honduran former professional football player and manager.

He was a member of the national squad at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia and the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.

==Club career==
Nicknamed &quot;el Enano&quot; (the Dwarf) because of his short build, Turcios began his professional career with Universidad of his native Honduras in 1996, making his debut in the 1997 Apertura, then he played with F.C. Motagua winning his first Honduran championship before moving to Deportivo Maldonado of Uruguay in 2001. After a year with Maldonado, he moved to Defensor Sporting, where he would last even less time, moving later in the year to Peñarol.

Turcios moved on to the Liga MX México Primera División in 2004, signing with Estudiantes Tecos. After one season with the Guadalajara-based club, he returned home to Honduras to play with Olimpia. Outside of a one-season stint with Guatemalan side Comunicaciones in 2006, Turcios was a regular fixture in Olimpia&#x27;s line-up from 2005 to 2012.

He signed with Atlanta Silverbacks of the North American Soccer League in February 2012. He played the 2012 Apertura season for Real Sociedad but left the club claiming they ended his contract and demanding money. He did not plan to retire after the season, hinting to a return to Motagua, which was later denied by the club.

He finally joined Honduran second division side UPNFM for the 2013 Clausura.

==International career==
Turcios made his debut for Honduras in a November 1999 friendly match against Trinidad &amp; Tobago and has earned a total of 87 caps, scoring 7 goals. He has represented his country in 33 FIFA World Cup qualification matches, at the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He also played at the 2001 and 2009 UNCAF Nations Cups as well as at the 2000, 2003 and 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cups. Also, he played at the 2001 Copa América.

His final international appearance was a June 2010 FIFA World Cup match against Switzerland.

<doc id="1257362" wikidata="Q804020" url="?curid=1257362" title="Possessive affix">
<text>In linguistics, a possessive affix (from ) is an affix (usually suffix or prefix) attached to a noun to indicate its possessor, much in the manner of possessive adjectives.

Possessive affixes are found in many languages of the world. The &quot;World Atlas of Language Structures&quot; lists 642 languages with possessive suffixes, possessive prefixes, or both out of a total sample of 902 languages. Possessive suffixes are found in some Austronesian, Uralic, Altaic, Semitic, and Indo-European languages. Complicated systems are found in the Uralic languages; for example, Nenets has 27 (3×3×3) different types of forms distinguish the possessor (first-, second- or third-person), the number of possessors (singular, dual or plural) and the number of objects (singular, dual or plural). That allows Nenets-speakers to express the phrase &quot;we two&#x27;s many houses&quot; in one word. Mayan languages and Nahuan languages also have possessive prefixes.

==Uralic languages== 
===Finnish===
Finnish uses possessive suffixes. The number of possessors and their person can be distinguished for the singular and plural except for the third person. However, the construction hides the number of possessed objects when the singular objects are in nominative or genitive case and plural objects in nominative case since &quot;käteni&quot; may mean either &quot;my hand&quot; (subject or direct object), &quot;of my hand&quot; (genitive) or &quot;my hands&quot; (subject or direct object). For example, the following are the forms of &quot;talo&quot; (&quot;house&quot;), declined to show possession:

The grammatical cases are not affected by the possessive suffix except for the accusative case (&quot;-n&quot; or unmarked), which is left unmarked by anything other than the possessive suffix. The third-person suffix is used only if the possessor is the subject. For example, &quot;Mari maalasi talonsa&quot; &quot;Mari painted her house&quot;, cf. the use of the genitive case in &quot;Toni maalasi Marin talon&quot; &quot;Toni painted Mari&#x27;s house&quot;. (The &quot;-n&quot; on the word &quot;talon&quot; is the accusative case, which is pronounced the same as the genitive case.)

For emphasis or clarification, the possessor can be given outside the word as well, using the genitive case. In this case, the possessive suffix remains. For example, &quot;my house&quot; can be &quot;taloni or minun taloni&quot; in which &quot;minun&quot; is the genitive form of the first-person singular pronoun.

Omission of the possessive suffix makes it possible to distinguish the plural for the possessed objects, but that is not considered proper language: &quot;mun käsi&quot; &quot;my hand&quot; vs. &quot;mun kädet&quot; &quot;my hands&quot;. Systematic omission of possessive suffixes is found in Spoken Finnish, wherever a pronoun in the genitive is used, but that is found only in direct address: &quot;Their coats are dry&quot; is &quot;Niiden takit on kuivia&quot; (&quot;niiden&quot; lit. &quot;they&#x27;s&quot;). That can be contrasted with indirect possession, as in &quot;They took their coats&quot;, in which the possessive suffix is used: &quot;Ne otti takkinsa&quot;. Even in proper Finnish, the pronouns &quot;sen&quot; and &quot;niiden&quot;, which are the demonstrative as well as inanimate forms of &quot;hänen&quot; and &quot;heidän&quot;, do not impose possessive suffixes except indirectly. It would be hypercorrect to say &quot;niiden talonsa&quot;. There is also a distinction in meaning in the third person on whether or not the third-person possessive pronoun is used:
:&quot;He ottivat (omat) takkinsa.&quot; = &quot;They took their (own) coats.&quot; (The possessor cannot be mentioned, even for emphasis, when it the same as the subject.)
:&quot;He ottivat heidän takkinsa.&quot; = &quot;They took their (others&#x27;) coats.&quot; (When a third person pronoun is mentioned as the possessor, it must refer to someone other than the subject of the sentence.)
:&quot;He kertoivat tekevänsä (itse).&quot; = &quot;They told they would come (themselves).&quot; (The doer cannot be mentioned, even for emphasis, when it is the same as previously.)
:&quot;He kertoivat heidän tulevan.&quot; = &quot;They told they (others) would come.&quot; (When a third person pronoun is mentioned as the subject of the second sentence, it must refer to someone other than the subject of the first sentence.)

===Hungarian===
Hungarian is another Uralic language. Distantly related to Finnish, Hungarian follows similar rule as given above for Finnish, except that it does not use genitive case for emphasis. To say &quot;Maria&#x27;s house&quot;, one would say : literally &#x27;Maria her house&#x27;, where means &#x27;her/his/its house&#x27; (&quot;see His genitive&quot;).

:See also Possessive suffixes in the article &quot;Hungarian grammar (noun phrases)&quot;.

==Semitic languages==
===Arabic===
Arabic, a Semitic language, uses personal suffixes, also classified as enclitic pronouns, for the genitive and accusative cases of the personal pronouns. The genitive and accusative forms are identical, except for the 1st person singular, which is &quot;-ī&quot; in genitive and &quot;-nī&quot; in accusative case. They can be used with nouns, expressing possession, with prepositions, which require the genitive case, or with verbs, expressing the object. Examples for personal suffixes expressing possession, using the word بيت &quot;bayt(u)&quot; (&quot;house&quot;) as a base:

===Hebrew===
In Hebrew, a Northwest Semitic language, possessive suffixes are optional. They are more common in formal, archaic, or poetic language and for certain nouns than on others. For instance, &quot;my home&quot; can be written &quot;בֵּיתִי&quot; (beiti). However, the following are some different ways to express possession, using the word &quot;בַּיִת&quot; (&quot;bayit&quot;, house) as a base:

*my house: &quot;בֵּיתִי&quot; &quot;beiti&quot; (house-my), &quot;הַבַּיִת שֶׁלִּי&quot; &quot;ha-bayit sheli&quot; (the-house of-me)
*your (masc., sing.) house: &quot;בֵּיתְךָ&quot; &quot;beitkha&quot; (house-your), &quot;הַבַּיִת שֶׁלְּךָ&quot; &quot;ha-bayit shelkha&quot; (the-house of-you)
*Adam&#x27;s house: &quot;בֵּית אָדָם&quot; &quot;beit Adam&quot; (house-of Adam), &quot;בֵּיתוֹ שֶׁל אָדָם&quot; &quot;beito shel Adam&quot; (house-his of Adam), &quot;הַבַּיִת שֶׁל אָדָם&quot; &quot;ha-bayit shel Adam&quot; (the-house of Adam)

===Assyrian===
In Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, a Modern Aramaic language, possessive pronouns are suffixes that are attached to the end of nouns to express possession similar to the English pronouns &quot;my, your, his, her,&quot; etc., which reflects the gender and the number of the person or persons.

Although possessive suffixes are more convenient and common, they can be optional for some people and seldom used, especially among those with the Tyari and Barwari dialects. The following are the alternative ways to express possession, using the word &quot;bĕtā&quot; (&quot;house&quot;) as a base:

*my house: &quot;bĕtā it dēyi&quot; (&quot;house of mine&quot;)
*your (masc., sing.) house: &quot;bĕtā it dēyūkh&quot; (&quot;house of yours&quot;)
*your (fem., sing.) house: &quot;bĕtā it dēyakh&quot; 
*your (plural) house: &quot;bĕtā it dēyōkhūn&quot; (&quot;house of yours&quot;)
*3rd person (masc., sing.): &quot;bĕtā it dēyū&quot; (&quot;house of his&quot;)
*3rd person (fem., sing.): &quot;bĕtā it dēyō&quot; (&quot;house of hers&quot;)
*3rd person (plural): &quot;bĕtā it dēyĕh&quot; (&quot;house of theirs&quot;)

== Indo-European languages ==
===Armenian===
In Armenian, the following suffixes are used (Eastern standard):

=== Persian ===
Persian, an Indo-European language, has possessive suffixes:
e.g. pedar&quot;-am my father; barâdar&quot;-aš his/her brother

== Central Morocco Tamazight ==
Central Morocco Tamazight&#x27;s use of possessive suffixes mirrors that of many other Afro-Asiatic languages.
# -inw is used when the noun ends in a consonant

Independent possessives are formed by attaching the possessive suffixes to (if the object possessed is masculine) or &#x27; (for feminine), e.g. (&#x27;mine&#x27;).

==Turkish==
Possessive forms of the noun &quot;&quot; (&quot;house&quot;):

The plural of &quot;ev&quot; is &quot;evler&quot;, and the form &quot;evleri&quot; is ambiguous; it can be , with the 3rd-person plural possessive suffix, or , with the 3rd-person singular possessive suffix. Additionally, when suffixed to a plural form, the plural suffix &quot;-leri&quot; is replaced by &quot;-i&quot;, so &quot;their houses&quot; is not *&quot;evlerleri&quot; but just also &quot;evleri&quot;, making this form triply ambiguous.

The Turkish possessive suffixes obey vowel harmony (&quot;&quot; – &quot;arrow&quot;; &quot;okum&quot; – &quot;my arrow&quot;; &quot;okları&quot; – &quot;their arrow&quot; or &quot;his/her/their arrows&quot;). If the word to which they are attached ends on a vowel, an initial vowel of the possessive suffix is elided (&quot;&quot; – &quot;father&quot;; &quot;babam&quot; – &quot;my father&quot;).

==Malay==
In Malay, an Austronesian language, the following suffixes can be added to nouns to indicate possession.

Not all pronouns are added in this way; most are written as separate words. For example, &quot;your country&quot; can also be expressed as &quot;negara anda&quot; or &quot;negara engkau&quot;, and &quot;our country&quot; as &quot;negara kita&quot; (if the reader is included) or &quot;negara kami&quot; (if the reader is excluded).

==Classical Nahuatl==
Classical Nahuatl, an Uto-Aztecan language, uses possessive prefixes.

<doc id="1257367" wikidata="Q712328" url="?curid=1257367" title="Theodorus of Cyrene">
<text>Theodorus of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (; 450 BC) was an ancient Greek mathematician. The only first-hand accounts of him that survive are in three of Plato&#x27;s dialogues: the &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, the &quot;Sophist&quot;, and the &quot;Statesman&quot;. In the former dialogue, he posits a mathematical construction now known as the Spiral of Theodorus.

==Life==
Little is known as Theodorus&#x27; biography beyond what can be inferred from Plato&#x27;s dialogues. He was born in the northern African colony of Cyrene, and apparently taught both there and in Athens. He complains of old age in the &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, the dramatic date of 399 BC of which suggests his period of flourishing to have occurred in the mid-5th century. The text also associates him with the sophist Protagoras, with whom he claims to have studied before turning to geometry. A dubious tradition repeated among ancient biographers like Diogenes Laërtius held that Plato later studied with him in Cyrene, Libya.
This eminent mathematician Theodorus was, along with Alcibiades and many other of Socrates&#x27; companions (many of whom would be associated with the Thirty Tyrants), accused of distributing the mysteries at a symposium, according to Plutarch, who himself was priest of the temple at Delphi.

==Work in mathematics==
Theodorus&#x27; work is known through a sole theorem, which is delivered in the literary context of the &quot;Theaetetus&quot; and has been argued alternately to be historically accurate or fictional. In the text, his student Theaetetus attributes to him the theorem that the square roots of the non-square numbers up to 17 are irrational:
The square containing &quot;two&quot; square units is not mentioned, perhaps because the incommensurability of its side with the unit was already known.) Theodorus&#x27;s method of proof is not known. It is not even known whether, in the quoted passage, &quot;up to&quot; (μέχρι) means that seventeen is included. If seventeen is excluded, then Theodorus&#x27;s proof may have relied merely on considering whether numbers are even or odd. Indeed, Hardy and Wright
and Knorr suggest proofs that rely ultimately on the following theorem: If formula_1 is soluble in integers, and formula_2 is odd, then formula_2 must be congruent to 1 &quot;modulo&quot; 8 (since formula_4 and formula_5 can be assumed odd, so their squares are congruent to 1 &quot;modulo&quot; 8.

That one cannot prove the irrationality the square root of 17 by considerations restricted to the arithmetic of the even and the odd has been shown in one system of the arithmetic of the even and the odd in and, but it is an open problem in a stronger natural axiom system for the arithmetic of the even and the odd 

A possibility suggested earlier by Zeuthen is that Theodorus applied the so-called Euclidean algorithm, formulated in Proposition X.2 of the &quot;Elements&quot; as a test for incommensurability. In modern terms, the theorem is that a real number with an &quot;infinite&quot; continued fraction expansion is irrational. Irrational square roots have periodic expansions. The period of the square root of 19 has length 6, which is greater than the period of the square root of any smaller number. The period of √17 has length one (so does √18; but the irrationality of √18 follows from that of √2).

The so-called Spiral of Theodorus is composed of contiguous right triangles with hypotenuse lengths equal √2, √3, √4, …, √17; additional triangles cause the diagram to overlap. Philip J. Davis interpolated the vertices of the spiral to get a continuous curve. He discusses the history of attempts to determine Theodorus&#x27; method in his book &quot;Spirals: From Theodorus to Chaos&quot;, and makes brief references to the matter in his fictional &quot;Thomas Gray&quot; series.

That Theaetetus established a more general theory of irrationals, whereby square roots of non-square numbers are irrational, is suggested in the eponymous Platonic dialogue as well as commentary on, and scholia to, the &quot;Elements&quot;.

<doc id="1257377" wikidata="Q495558" url="?curid=1257377" title="Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910">
<text>The Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, also known as the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty, was made by representatives of the Empire of Japan and the Korean Empire on 22 August 1910. In this treaty, Japan formally annexed Korea following the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 (by which Korea became a protectorate of Japan) and the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1907 (by which Korea was deprived of the administration of internal affairs).

Japanese commentators predicted that Koreans would easily assimilate into the Japanese Empire.

In 1965, the Treaty of Basic Relations between South Korea and Japan confirmed this treaty is &quot;already null and void&quot;.

==History==
The treaty was proclaimed to the public (and became effective) on 29 August 1910, officially starting the period of Japanese rule in Korea. The treaty had eight articles, the first being: &quot;His Majesty the Emperor of Korea makes the complete and permanent cession to His Majesty the Emperor of Japan of all rights of sovereignty over the whole of Korea&quot;.

Gojong of the Korean Empire later called the treaty a &quot;neugyak&quot; (, Forced treaty). This alternative term used in lieu of &quot;joyak&quot; (, Treaty) implies the Koreans were coerced into accepting the treaty by the Japanese. Terms such as &quot;Gyeongsul Gukchi&quot; (, National humiliation of the year of Gyeongsul) and &quot;Gukchi-il&quot; (, National humiliation day) are also used in Korea to refer to the year and date of the treaty&#x27;s proclamation.

The United Kingdom had already acquiesced to the annexation of Korea by Japan, via the British connection to Imperial Japan via the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902 and 1905; and the United States had also sanctioned the annexation, as per the Taft-Katsura Agreement.

== Japanese annexation of Korea ==
The Empire of Japan had already confirmed the policy of Annexation at the Cabinet Meeting on 6 July 1909. However, it was left only to minimize side effects and obtain an international justification. The Japanese imperial government was preparing a scenario for a &quot;merger petition&quot; to Shigemaru Sugiyama, an advisor of the Iljinhoe. Prior to this, Song Byeong-jun went to the Empire of Japan in February 1909 and held a bargaining for the country. Many times, Itō Hirobumi urged a &quot;merger&quot;, but when work was delayed due to the Japanese imperial armed forces&#x27; plan, he went directly to the Empire of Japan and negotiated a &quot;merger&quot; against the Japanese imperial Prime Minister Katsura Tarō and other members of the Japanese imperial Choya.

If Song Byeong-jun&#x27;s cabinet is established, not only is there a risk of retaliation, but also Ye Wanyong, fearing that the main role of the annexation will be taken away, said, &quot;Even if the current cabinet collapses, a more pro-Japanese cabinet cannot come out.&quot; and voluntarily informed the Ministry of Knowledge Economy that it was possible. 

In directing such a scenario, the Empire of Japan gradually decided that the period of “Annexation” was ripening, and promoted Shigemaru to make a “joining petition” using Lee Yong-gu and Song Byeong-jun. 

==Legality==
The legality of the treaty was later disputed by the exiled Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, as well as the South Korean government. While the treaty was affixed with the national seal of the Korean Empire, Emperor Sunjong of Korea refused to sign the treaty as required under Korean law. The treaty was instead signed by Prime Minister Ye Wanyong of the Korean Empire, and Resident General Count Terauchi Masatake of the Empire of Japan.

This issue caused considerable difficulty in the negotiations for the establishment of basic diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea in 1965. The South Korean government held the position that the annexation treaty was null and void at the time of signing, which the Japanese government contested. A compromise was reached in Article II of the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations:

&quot;It is confirmed that all treaties or agreements concluded between the Empire of Japan and the Empire of Korea on or before August 22, 1910, are already null and void.&quot;

=== Conference to discuss legality of the treaty ===

In January, April, and November 2001, an academic conference on the legality of Japan&#x27;s annexation of Korea from 1910 to 1945 (titled &quot;A reconsideration of Japanese Annexation of Korea from the Historical and International Law Perspectives&quot;) was held at Harvard University with the support of the Korea Foundation. Scholars of history and international law participated from South Korea, North Korea, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada.

Anthony Carty, a professor at the University of Derby, stated, &quot;During the height of the imperialism, it is difficult to find an international law sufficient to determine the legality/illegality of a particular treaty.&quot; According to the &quot;Asian Yearbook of International Law&quot;, in his book on international law, &quot;Carty prefers seeing the relationship between Japan and Korea at the time with reference to the reality of the then international community dominated by Western powers, rather than viewing it in terms of treaty law as argued by Korean scholars&quot;.

Alexis Dudden, a professor at the University of Connecticut, discussed Nitobe Inazō&#x27;s science of colonial policy. She is the author of &quot;Japan&#x27;s Colonization of Korea: Discourse and Power&quot; in which she discusses how Japanese policymakers carefully studied and then invoked international law to annex Korea legally.

According to Kan Kimura, a major result of this conference is that the Korean claim that the annexation was illegal was rejected by the participating Western scholars, as well as others specializing in international law.

==Activism==
On 28 August 2007, regarding the General Power of Attorney by Sunjong, Korean newspaper &quot;Dong-a Ilbo&quot; reported that Korean monarchs did not sign in the official documents with their real names, traditionally, but the Korean Emperor was forced by Japan to follow a new custom to sign with his real name, which originated from the Western Hemisphere. It mentioned Sunjong&#x27;s signature may be compulsory.

On 23 June 2010, 75 South Korean congressmen suggested the legal nullification of the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty to the Prime Minister Naoto Kan.

On 6 July 2010, Korean and Japanese progressive Christian groups gathered in Tokyo&#x27;s Korean YMCA chapter and jointly declared that the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty was unjustified.

On 28 July 2010, around 1000 intellectuals in Korea and Japan issued a joint statement that the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty was never valid in the first place.

<doc id="1257384" wikidata="Q3486452" url="?curid=1257384" title="Skykomish River">
<text>The Skykomish River is a long river in the U.S. state of Washington which drains the west side of the Cascade Mountains in the southeast section of Snohomish County and the northeast corner of King County. The river starts with the confluence of the North Fork Skykomish River and South Fork Skykomish River approximately one mile west of Index, then flowing northwesterly towards Puget Sound. It is joined by the Sultan River and the Wallace River at Sultan. It then meets the Snoqualmie River to form the Snohomish River at Monroe. The Snohomish River continues along the river valley eventually dumping into Port Gardner Bay on Possession Sound (part of Puget Sound).

The name &quot;Skykomish&quot; comes from the Lushootseed name of the Skykomish people, , meaning &quot;upriver people.&quot; It is sometimes referred to by the nickname &quot;Sky River&quot; or &quot;The Sky&quot;.

== Course ==
The Skykomish River&#x27;s main stem is long, from the confluence of its North and South fork, until it and the Snoqualmie forms the Snohomish River. Adding the longest headwater tributaries, South Fork Skykomish and Tye River, the length is . The Skykomish&#x27;s drainage basin is in area. U.S. Highway 2 and the BNSF Railway are routed to follow the Skykomish River, South Fork Skykomish, and Tye River to Stevens Pass and the Cascade Tunnel.

=== North Fork ===
The headwaters of the North Fork Skykomish River are located in the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness near Dishpan Gap along the Pacific Crest Trail. It flows as a small stream off the north slope of Skykomish Peak. The Wild Sky Wilderness protects tributaries and forests adjacent to the North Fork Skykomish, although not the river itself. The river flows generally in a southwestern direction from its source to its mouth. Just before picking up Goblin Creek, the river flows through a short but impressive canyon and within that canyon the river drops over Deer Falls. A short ways down from that, the river flows through an even shorter but very twisted and unusually shaped canyon at Bear Creek Falls.
* Pass Creek: Leads to Cady Pass.
* Quartz Creek: Flows from Monte Cristo Peak, leads to Curry Gap.
* Goblin Creek: Flows from Monte Cristo Peak.
* West Cady Creek
* Troublesome Creek: Flows from Monte Cristo Peak, through Blanca Lake, to join the North Fork just below Bear Creek Falls.
* Silver Creek: Rises near Silvertip Mountain and Poodle Dog Pass, flows by Mineral City, joins North Fork just above Galena (early route to Monte Cristo mining district; both Mineral City and Galena former mining towns).
* Salmon Creek: Joins North Fork just below Galena.
* Trout Creek: Upstream of the town of Index, just downstream of the Index-Galena Road washout. Trout Creek road is currently blocked (as of 2015).

=== South Fork ===
The South Fork Skykomish River begins at the confluence of the Tye River and the Foss River, to the east of Skykomish. From the confluence the South Fork flows northwest. Near the eastern boundary of the city of Skykomish, the Beckler River joins it. To the west of the city of Skykomish, the Miller River joins it. Shortly before converging with the North Fork the river drops over Eagle Falls, followed by Canyon Falls and then, finally, Sunset Falls before its confluence with the North Fork.
* Beckler River: Joins just below the river&#x27;s source.
** Rapid River
* Miller River: Joins at Miller River.
* Money Creek: Joins the South Fork near Grotto.
* Lowe Creek: Joins the South Fork between Baring and Grotto.
* Pinecone Creek: Joins the South Fork between Baring and Grotto.
* Index Creek: Joins the South Fork near Baring.
* Barclay Creek

== Discharge ==

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the South Fork is about twice the size of the North Fork in terms of both discharge and watershed area above their confluence at Index, making it the true hydrologic source of the Skykomish River. The South Fork average flow of is sourced from a drainage area of , compared to the North Fork which has an average flow of from a drainage area of . In turn the source of the South Fork – in terms of streamflow – is the Rapid River, a tributary of the Beckler River, which in turn is a tributary of the South Fork Skykomish.

Glacial loss in the higher portion of the watershed in the Cascades has led to declining streamflow, especially during the late summer. In 2022, researchers determined that Hinman Glacier, which as recently as 1971 was the largest glacier in the river&#x27;s watershed, had completely retreated as a result of climate change. As a whole, the area of the Skykomish watershed that was covered by glacial ice decreased from in 1958 to in 2022 - a 55% loss. Consequently, days with streamflow below the threshold necessary to maintain short-term survival of fish in the river has increased. Annual precipitation values had not been observed as declining.

==History==

In the 1890s the Great Northern Railway was built along the Skykomish, South Fork Skykomish, and Tye Rivers, crossing the crest of the Cascades at Stevens Pass. Today the track is owned by BNSF Railway, known as the Burlington Northern Railroad from 1970 to 1995. Stevens Pass is named after the Great Northern surveyor John Frank Stevens. Two railroad tunnels, both called Cascade Tunnel, were built at Stevens Pass. The first one was built slightly north of the pass. It was replaced in 1929 with the New Cascade Tunnel, which at long was for nearly 60 years the longest railroad tunnel in North America and is still the longest in the United States. The New Cascade Tunnel is a few miles south of Stevens Pass. Its western entrance is near the confluence of Tunnel Creek and the Tye River. A small amount of the water flows out of both tunnels into the Tye River. An interpretive center for the Iron Goat Trail, located at Scenic on the upper Tye River, describes the history of the area including the old railroad and new trail. The interpretive center was built near the site of one of the greatest railroad tragedies in American history, the Wellington Disaster.

One of the Native American trails crossing the Cascades followed the Skykomish and North Fork Skykomish to Cady Pass.

== Recreation ==

The Skykomish River is used for rafting and kayaking, especially around the Index, WA area during the summer months. The Skykomish River is mostly ranked between Class III and Class III+ rapids, depending on the circumstances and season, but includes Boulder Drop, a class IV+ rapids. Skykomish and its tributaries also popular place for recreational fishing. River is a home for chinook, coho and pink salmon, steelhead and bull trout.
