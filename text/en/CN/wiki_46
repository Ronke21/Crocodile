<text>The Maserati Quattroporte () is a four-door luxury sports sedan produced by Italian automobile manufacturer Maserati. The name translated from Italian means &quot; &quot;. The car is in its sixth generation, with the first generation introduced in 1963.


==Quattroporte I (AM107, 1963–1969)==
The original Maserati Quattroporte (&quot;Tipo AM107&quot;) was built between 1963 and 1969. It was a large saloon powered by V8 engines—both firsts for a series production Maserati automobile.

===History===

The task of styling the Quattroporte was given to Turinese coachbuilder Pietro Frua, who drew inspiration from a special 5000 GT (chassis number 103.060) which he had designed in 1962 for Prince Karim Aga Khan. While the design was by Frua, body construction was carried out by Vignale.

====Series I (1963–1966)====

The Quattroporte was introduced at the October–November 1963 Turin Motor Show, where a pre-production prototype was on the Maserati stand next to the Mistral coupé. Regular production began in 1964.
The Tipo 107 Quattroporte joined two other grand tourers, the Facel Vega and the Lagonda Rapide, capable of traveling at speeds of up to on the new motorways in Europe.
It was equipped with a 4.1-litre () V8 engine, rated at at 5,000 rpm, and equipped with either a five-speed ZF manual transmission or a three-speed Borg Warner automatic on request. Maserati claimed a top speed of .
The car was also exported to the United States, where federal regulations mandated twin round headlamps in place of the single rectangular ones found on European models.

Maserati manufactured 230 of its first generation Quattroportes Between 1963 and 1966.

====Series II (1966–1969)====

In 1966, Maserati revised the Tipo 107, adding the twin headlights already used on the U.S. model. A leaf-sprung solid axle took the place of the previous De Dion tube. The interior was completely redesigned, including the dashboard which now had a full width wood-trimmed fascia.
In 1968 alongside the 4.1-litre a 4.7-litre version became also available (&quot;AM107/4700&quot;), developing DIN. Top speed increased to a claimed , making the Quattroporte 4700 the fastest four-door sedan in the world at the time.

Around 500 of the second series were made, for a total of 776 &quot;Tipo 107&quot; Quattroportes. Production ended in 1969.

===Specifications===

The first generation of the Quattroporte had a steel unibody structure, complemented by a front subframe.
Front suspension was independent, with coil springs and hydraulic dampers. Rear suspension used a coil sprung De Dion tube featuring inboard brakes on the first series, later changed to a more conventional Salisbury leaf sprung solid axle with a single trailing link on the second series. On both axles there were anti-roll bars. Brakes were solid Girling discs all around. A limited slip differential was optional.

====Engines====
The long lived quad cam, all-aluminium Maserati V8 engine made its début on the Quattroporte. It featured two chain-driven overhead camshafts per bank, 16 angled valves, hemispherical combustion chambers, inserted cast iron wet cylinder liners, and was fed through an aluminium, water-cooled inlet manifold by four downdraft twin-choke Weber carburetors—initially 38 DCNL 5 and 40 DCNL 5 on 4200 and 4700 cars respectively, later changed to 40 DCNF 5 and 42 DCNF 5 starting from December 1968.


== Special models (AM121, 1971 and 1974)==

In 1971, Karim Aga Khan ordered another special one-off based on the Maserati Indy platform. Rory Brown was commissioned as the chief engineer of the project. The car received the 4.9-litre V8 engine (&quot;Tipo AM 107/49&quot;), rated at . Carrozzeria Frua designed the car, the prototype of which was displayed in 1971 and 1972 in Paris and Geneva respectively. The car was production ready, even receiving its own chassis code (AM 121), but new owner Citroën used their influence to have Maserati develop the SM-based Quattroporte II instead. Only two vehicles were finished, chassis #004 was sold by Maserati to the Aga Khan in 1974, and the prototype #002 went to the King of Spain, who bought the car directly from Frua. 
==Quattroporte II (AM123, 1974–1978)==
The second generation Quattroporte, named Maserati Quattroporte II (&quot;AM 123&quot;), was introduced at the Paris Motor Show and the Turin Motor Show in October 1974. As the result of Citroën&#x27;s joint-venture with Maserati in 1968, the Quattroporte II was very different from its predecessor and the other Maserati automobiles of the past. Based on a stretched version of the Citroën SM&#x27;s chassis, the Quattroporte II featured a front-mid-engine, front-wheel-drive layout, hydropneumatic suspension, four fixed headlamps with two swivelling directional headlights, and a V6 engine. The bodywork was designed by Marcello Gandini at Bertone.

Maserati had planned to equip Quattroporte II with a V8 engine, but the Tipo 107 V8 engine was too large for the Citroën SM based chassis on top of being too obsolete. A prototype for a 4.0-litre V8 engine was built from two compact Citroën-Maserati V6 engines. Maserati cut through the rear cylinders in half on one block (2.5 cylinders per bank, discarding the rear) and the middle cylinders in half on another block (1.5 cylinders per bank, discarding the front) then welded the blocks together. The output was . The new V8 engine was fitted to the Citroën SM for durability testing which lasted for . This was done to prove that the chassis was robust enough to handle the additional power of the larger engine. Alejandro de Tomaso, the Italian entrepreneur who took over Maserati in 1975, cancelled the V8 engine programme.

A single running prototype of the Quattroporte II was built and tested in 1974. The 1973 oil crisis and the collapse of Citroën&#x27;s finances in 1974 prevented Maserati from gaining the EEC approval for the European market. The production did not commence until 1976, and each Quattroporte II was built to order and sold in the Middle East and Spain where the type approval was not needed. Only twelve production cars were built from 1976 to 1978.

The engineering and development had cost Maserati about four billion lire by the time the production ended in 1978.
==Quattroporte III/Royale (AM330, 1979–1990)==

The third generation of the Maserati Quattroporte (&quot;Tipo AM 330&quot;) was developed under the Alejandro de Tomaso-GEPI ownership. After the Citroën-era front-wheel drive Quattroporte II, the third generation returned to rear-wheel drive with an enlarged variation of the Maserati Tipo 107 V8 engine. The exterior was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro.

===History===
From 1974 to 1976, Giorgetto Giugiaro presented two Italdesign show cars on Maserati platforms, called the Medici I and Medici II. The latter had features that would make it into the production version of the third-generation of the Quattroporte.

A pre-production Quattroporte was introduced to the press by the then Maserati president Alejandro de Tomaso on 1 November 1976, in advance of its début at the Turin Motor Show later that month. It was only three years later though, in 1979, that the production version of the car went on sale. De Tomaso, who disliked Citroën, removed all of the influence of the French marque from the car. The quad-cam V8 engines built since 1963 were used in a stretched version of the Maserati Kyalami chassis. The SM V8 engine prototype under development in the Citroën ownership was also scrapped and the staff was replaced, the most notable being head engineer Giulio Alfieri who was replaced by Aurelio Bertocchi. The hydraulic system of the Quattroporte II was replaced by a conventional power steering setup and the suspension geometry was akin to the Jaguar XJ.
Initially badging reading &quot;4PORTE&quot; was used, but this was changed in 1981 to ones spelling out &quot;Quattroporte&quot;. Two versions of the V8 engine were available: a version generating a maximum power output of , and a smaller built-to-order engine generating , which was phased out in 1981. The interior was upholstered in leather and trimmed in briar wood. The climate controls came from the Mopar parts bin on early US-spec cars. In 1984, the climate control system was upgraded to share parts with the mass produced Biturbo.

The Quattroporte III marked the last of the hand-built Italian cars; all exterior joints and seams were filled to give a seamless appearance. From 1987 onwards, the Royale superseded the Quattroporte. The Quattroporte III was an instant success and 120 units were sold in Italy in 1980 alone.

====Maserati Royale====
On 14 December 1986, at Maserati&#x27;s 60th anniversary as a car manufacturer, De Tomaso presented the Maserati Royale in Modena, a built-to-order, ultra-luxury version of the Quattroporte. It featured a higher compression 4.9-litre V8 engine, generating a maximum power output of . Besides the usual leather upholstery and veneer trim, the car featured a revised dashboard with an analogue clock, four electrically adjustable seats, retractable veneered tables in the rear doors, and a mini-bar. Visually, the Royale was distinguished by new disc-shaped alloy wheels and silver-coloured side sills. A limited production run of 120 cars was announced, but when production ceased in 1990 only 53 cars were completed.

In all, including the Royale, production of the Quattroporte III amounted to 2,155 units in total.

===Specifications===

The Quattroporte III utilised an all-steel unibody structure. The chassis was related to that of the Kyalami, in turn derived from the De Tomaso Longchamp and therefore ultimately related to the De Tomaso Deauville luxury saloon.
Front suspension was of the double wishbone type, with single coaxial dampers and coil springs and an anti-roll bar.
The rear axle used a peculiar layout very similar to Jaguar independent rear suspension. Each cast aluminium hub carrier was linked to the chassis only by a single lower wishbone, the half shafts doubling as upper control arms, and was sprung by twin coaxial dampers and coil springs units. Rear brakes were mounted inboard, the callipers were bolted directly to the housing of the differential. The entire assembly was supported by a bushing-insulated crossbeam. Initially a Salisbury-type limited slip differential was used; in 1984 it was replaced by a more advanced Gleason-licensed Torsen—or &quot;Sensitork&quot; in Maserati parlance.

The engine was an evolution of Maserati&#x27;s own all-aluminium, quad overhead cam V8, fed by four Weber carburetors. The automatic transmission used was a three-speed Chrysler A727 &quot;Torqueflite&quot; gearbox. The manual gearboxes are ZF S5 five speed units. When leaving the factory all the cars were originally fitted with Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72).

===Coachbuilders===
Milanese coachbuilder Carrozzeria Pavesi outfitted several armoured Quattroportes during the 1980s.
One of them, a 1983 Blu Sera example nicknamed &quot;Calliope&quot;, was notably used by President of the Italian Republic Sandro Pertini as the official state car during his tenure.

Autocostruzioni SD of Turinese coachbuilder Salvatore Diomante also offered a 65 cm longer limousine version, fully equipped with white leather, &quot;abundant burr walnut&quot;, mini-bar, video cassette player and many other necessities. The price of the Diomante limousine at its introduction in 1986 was 210 million lire.

==Quattroporte IV (AM337 1994–2001)==

The fourth generation of the Quattroporte (&quot;Tipo AM337&quot;) was manufactured from 1994 to 2001 and was the first car to be produced under the Fiat ownership after Alejandro de Tomaso sold his entire holding to the Italian marque in 1993. It was built on an evolved and stretched (by 5 cm) version of the Biturbo saloon&#x27;s architecture, and used the twin-turbocharged V6 and later the new AM578 V8 engine from the Shamal flagship grand tourer. For this reason, the car retained very compact exterior dimensions, and is smaller than any of its predecessors and successors. As the designer&#x27;s signature angular rear wheel arches gave away, the wedge-shaped aerodynamic () body was penned by Marcello Gandini.

===History===
The world première of the fourth generation of the Quattroporte took place at the April 1994 Turin Motor Show and the car went on sale towards the end of the year. Initially the Quattroporte was powered by the twin-turbocharged, 24-valve V6 engines from the Ghibli. For export markets there was a 2.8-litre unit, generating a maximum power output of and allowing the car to attain a claimed top speed of . As local taxation strongly penalised cars over two-litre in displacement, Italian buyers were offered a 2.0 L version, which developed a little more power () but less torque than the 2.8-litre version; on the home market, the 2.8 was not offered until a year after its introduction.
The cabin was fully upholstered in Connolly leather and trimmed in elm burl wood veneer. Weight was also reduced by at least as compared to the Quattroporte III primarily due to the compact Biturbo underpinnings and by the use of a compact powerplant.

After having been displayed in December 1995 at the Bologna Motor Show, a 3.2-litre twin-turbocharged V8 Quattroporte was added to the range in 1996: the new AM578 engine, an evolution of the Shamal V8, generated a maximum power output of 335 PS (247 kW; 330 hp). The top speed was claimed to be . At the same time, some minor updates were introduced on all models: new eight-spoke alloy wheels and aerodynamic wing mirrors, and &quot;seicilindri&quot; or &quot;ottocilindri&quot; (Italian for &quot;six&quot; and &quot;eight-cylinders&quot; respectively) badges on the front fenders, denoting which engine was under the bonnet.

As standard, all the three engines were mated to a Getrag 6-speed manual transmission, while 4-speed automatic transmissions were available on request with the 2.8 and 3.2 engines respectively—4HP22 by ZF Friedrichshafen and a computer-controlled transmission supplied by an Australian firm BTR.

In July 1997, Fiat&#x27;s subsidiary Ferrari acquired a 50% controlling stake in Maserati S.p.A.. Ferrari immediately undertook a renewal of Maserati&#x27;s dated production facilities, as well as made improvements to the manufacturing methods and quality control.

The steps taken by the new parent company resulted in the improved Quattroporte Evoluzione which was introduced at the March 1998 Geneva Motor Show. It featured 400 all-new or modified parts out of a total 800 main components. Powertrains and performance remained unvaried, save for the adoption of the same BTR transmission from the 3.2 V8 for the automatic 2.8 V6 model. The Evoluzione no longer had the oval Maserati clock on the dashboard and had redesigned wing mirrors. Ferrari management decided to drop the 2.0 L V6 from the Evoluzione lineup, when they were offered alongside the new 3200 GT, and so the new cars were distinguished from the earlier models by &quot;V6 evoluzione&quot; or &quot;V8 evoluzione&quot; badges on the front fenders. Production of the fourth generation of the Quattroporte ended in May 2001 and 2,400 units were made in total with 730 being the Evoluzione versions.

Japanese importer Cornes &amp; Co. ordered a special numbered edition of the Quattroporte for their customers. &quot;Cornes Serie Speciale&quot; were the last cars built and were limited to only 50 examples. Available in both V6 and V8 Evoluzione variants, all were equipped with the automatic transmission. This special edition is the only Quattroporte to have a Maserati badge inserted into the C-door-pillar. Even though other Evoluziones had the Lassale clock replaced with the Maserati trident, this edition retained the original timepiece.

===Specifications===
The Quattroporte is a four-door, five-seater saloon with a steel unibody construction. The overall layout remained unchanged from the Biturbo from which the car descended: longitudinal front engine, rear-wheel drive, all-independent suspension with MacPherson struts upfront and trailing arms at the rear. Despite these similarities, the suspension had been re-engineered: rear trailing arms had a tube framework structure like on the Shamal, together with the limited slip differential. These two components were attached to the body via a newly designed tubular subframe.

==Quattroporte V (M139, 2003–2012)==


The fifth generation of the Quattroporte (&quot;Tipo M139&quot;) debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show on 9 September 2003 and made its U.S. première at the 2003 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance; production started in 2003. Exterior and interior design was penned by Pininfarina&#x27;s then chief designer Ken Okuyama. The last M139 Quattroporte was built on 20 December 2012.

Built on an entirely new platform named the M139, it was longer than its predecessor and sat on a longer wheelbase. The same architecture would later underpin the GranTurismo and GranCabrio coupés and convertibles.

Initially, the Quattroporte was powered by an evolution of the naturally aspirated dry sump 4.2-litre V8 engine, as used in the Maserati Coupé, with an increased power output of and new black plastic inlet manifold instead of an aluminium cast one. Due to its greater weight compared to the Coupé and Spyder, the 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration time for the Quattroporte is 5.2 seconds and the top speed is measured at .

Over 5,000 cars were built in 2006.

===History===
====2003–2008====
The Maserati Quattroporte was initially offered in only one configuration, equipped with an automated manual transmission, marketed as &quot;DuoSelect&quot;. The base Quattroporte DuoSelect featured a chrome grille with horizontal slats, adaptive suspension, marketed as &quot;Skyhook&quot; and 330 mm brake disks with four piston calipers at each wheel. Maserati offered fifteen exterior paint colours, Poltrona Frau leather upholstery in ten colours, contrasting seat piping and stitching and three types of wood inserts.

In 2004, the American luxury department store Neiman Marcus offered a limited edition of the Quattroporte, only available for order through the retailer&#x27;s 2004 Christmas Catalog at a price of 125,000 USD. Each of the 60 Neiman Marcus Quattroportes was finished in Bordeaux Pontevecchio (wine red) exterior colour and featured a chrome mesh-front grill along with side vents and 19-inch ball-polished wheels. The interior was upholstered in ivory Poltrona Frau leather accented with Bordeaux piping and mahogany wood trim.

At the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2005, Maserati introduced two different trim levels for the Quattroporte, the Executive GT and Sport GT.

The Quattroporte Executive GT was a comfort and luxury-oriented specification; it came equipped with a wood-rimmed steering wheel, an Alcantara-suede interior roof lining; ventilated, adaptive, massaging rear seats, rear air conditioning controls, veneered rear tables, and curtain shades on the rear windows. The exterior was distinguished by 19 inch eight-spoke ball-polished alloy wheels and chrome mesh front and side grilles.

The Quattroporte Sport GT variant offered several performance upgrades: a re-configured transmission providing faster gearshifts and a firmer Skyhook suspension system; courtesy of new software calibrations, seven-spoke 20 inch wheels with low-profile tyres, cross-drilled brake rotors, and braided brake lines. Model-specific exterior trim included dark mesh front and side grilles and red accents to the Trident badges, as on vintage racing Maserati models. Inside, there were aluminium pedals, a sport steering wheel and carbon fibre in place of the standard wood inserts.

A new 6-speed ZF-supplied automatic transmission was presented at the Detroit Motor Show in January 2007, with the first cars delivered right after the launch, marketed as Maserati Quattroporte Automatica. As all the three trim levels were offered in both DuoSelect and Automatica versions, the lineup grew to six models.

The Quattroporte Sport GT S was introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2007. Taking further the Sport GT&#x27;s focus on handling, this version employed Bilstein single-rate dampers in place of the Skyhook adaptive system. Other changes from the Sport GT were a lowered ride height and 10 mm wider 295/30 rear tyres, front Brembo iron/aluminium dual-cast brake rotors and red-painted six-piston callipers. The cabin was upholstered in mixed Alcantara and leather, with carbon fibre accents; on the exterior, the door handles were painted in body colour and the 20 inch wheels and the exhaust pipes were finished in a &quot;dark chrome&quot; shade.

At the 2008 North American International Auto Show, Maserati launched the Quattroporte Collezione Cento, a special edition of the Quattroporte limited to 100 examples.
Its unique specification featured an ivory paint colour with a waist coachline, matched to Cuoio tan tufted leather upholstery and Wengé trim inlaid with mother of pearl. Standard equipment comprised most of the available infotainment options.

====2008–2012 facelift====
The facelift Quattroporte débuted at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show. Overseen by Pininfarina, the facelift featured redesigned bumpers, side sills and wing mirrors (the latter carried over from the GranTurismo), a convex front grille with vertical bars instead of horizontal, new headlights and tail lights with directional bi-xenon main beams and LED turn signals. Inside there was a new navigation and entertainment system. All Quattroporte models now used the ZF automatic transmission, with the DuoSelect being discontinued.

The 4.2-litre Quattroporte featured single-rate damping comfort-tuned suspension and 18 inch wheels.
Debuting alongside was the Quattroporte S, powered by a wet-sump 4.7-litre V8 engine, the same engine utilised in the Maserati GranTurismo S, with a maximum power output of and maximum torque of . In conjunction with the engine, the braking system was upgraded to cross-drilled discs on both axles and dual-cast 360 mm rotors with six piston callipers at the front. Skyhook active damping suspension and 19 inch V-spoke wheels were standard. Trim differences from the standard 4.2-litre cars were limited to a chrome instead of a titanium-coloured front grille.

Production of the facelift Quattroporte models started in June 2008.

The Quattroporte Sport GT S premièred at the North American International Auto Show in January 2009. Its 4.7-litre V8 has a maximum power output of , ten more than the Quattroporte S, owing to a revised intake and a sport exhaust system with electronically actuated bypass valves. Other mechanical changes were made to the suspension system, where the Sport GT S single-rate dampers took place of the Skyhook system, ride height was further lowered and stiffer springs were adopted.
The exterior was distinguished by a specific front grille with concave vertical bars, black headlight bezels, red accents on the Trident badges, the absence of chrome window trim, body colour door handles and black double oval exhaust pipes instead of the quad round exhaust pipes found on other Quattroporte models. On the interior, the veneer trim was replaced by &quot;Titan Tex&quot; composite material and the cabin was upholstered in mixed Alcantara and leather.

The Quattroporte Centurion Edition was presented in March 2009 for the UK market. It was special version developed only for the holders of black American Express cards. The car was finished in black exterior colour and with the Centurion logo on the headrests and instrument panel. The engines available were the standard 4.2-litre and 4.7-litre V8.

A special edition of the Quattroporte GT S was introduced at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show: the Quattroporte Sport GT S Awards Edition, celebrating the 56 awards received by the fifth generation of the Quattroporte in just six years since its launch.
Its unique specification consisted of &quot;Nero pianoforte&quot; or specially-developed pale gold &quot;Quarzo fuso&quot; pearlescent paint, satin grey wheels, polished brake callipers and all chrome trim in a dark finish.
===Sales===
===Specifications===

The Quattroporte&#x27;s body is a steel unibody, with an aluminium boot lid and engine bonnet; the coefficient of drag is . Front and rear aluminium subframes support the whole suspension and drivetrain.

A 47%/53% front/rear weight distribution was achieved by setting the engine behind the front axle, inside the wheelbase (front-mid-engine layout) and the adoption of a transaxle layout. With the later automatic transmission - fitted in the conventional position en bloc with the engine - weight distribution changed to 49%/51% front/rear.
The suspension system consists of unequal length control arms with forged aluminium arms and hub carriers, coil springs and anti-roll bars on both axles.

====Transmissions====
The DuoSelect transmission available at the launch of the fifth generation of the Quattroporte was a development of the &quot;Cambiocorsa&quot; unit first used in the Maserati Coupé and built by Graziano Trasmissioni. It was a Ferrari-based automated manual transmission, mounted at the rear axle in the block with the differential in a transaxle layout, with the twin-plate dry clutch located in a bell housing attached to the rear of the engine. A torque tube joined rigidly together the two units.
Gear shifting was done via the standard paddle shifters behind the steering wheel; there was no gear lever on the centre tunnel, but rather a small T-shaped handle used to quickly engage first gear and reverse when maneuvering at slow speed.

The 6-speed torque converter automatic transmission was a 6HP26 supplied by ZF Friedrichshafen. Unlike the DuoSelect, it was placed in the conventional position right behind the engine; to accommodate it and the new rear differential the front and rear subframes as well as part of the transmission tunnel had to be redesigned.
Manual shifting was possible by the centre-console mounted gear lever; in addition, Sport GT cars came equipped with paddle shifters as standard, while on other models they were an optional extra. All Quattroporte models were fitted with a limited slip differential.

====Engines====
The V8 engines of the fifth generation of the Quattroporte belonged to the Ferrari-Maserati F136 family; they had aluminium-silicon alloy block and heads, a crossplane crankshaft, four valves per cylinder driven by two overhead camshafts per bank and continuous variable valve timing on the intake side. &quot;F136S&quot; 4.2-litre engines in DuoSelect equipped cars used a dry sump lubrication system; &quot;F136UC&quot; 4.2-litre engines on automatic cars were converted to use a wet sump oiling system, as did the later 4.7-litre, codenamed &quot;F136Y&quot;.

===Coachbuilders===

====Bellagio Fastback Touring====
In 2008, at the Concorso d&#x27;Eleganza Villa d&#x27;Este, Milanese coachbuilder Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera unveiled the Maserati Bellagio Fastback Touring, a 5-door hatchback built on the chassis of the fifth generation of the Quattroporte.
In May 2013 a Bellagio Fastback was auctioned by RM Auctions at their Villa Erba event, in occasion of Concorso d&#x27;Eleganza Villa d&#x27;Este; the price was €117,600. According to the auction house, four examples have been built by Carrozzeria Touring.

A Maserati Quattroporte V has also been used as a hearse as seen on the funeral of the Polish president Lech Kaczynski in 2010.

===Motorsport===
In 2009 Swiss Team announced the development of &quot;Maserati Quattroporte EVO&quot; International Superstars Series racing cars based on the 4.2-litre Quattroporte M139, to be piloted by Andrea Chiesa. Swiss Team fielded the cars in the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 seasons; Italian racing driver Andrea Bertolini won the 2011 championship season at the wheel of a Swiss Team Quattroporte.
==Quattroporte VI (M156, 2013–2023)==
The most recent and sixth-generation of the Quattroporte was introduced in early 2013. With a wheelbase it is a considerably larger vehicle than any of its predecessors, to set itself apart from the smaller Ghibli, which shares its underpinnings. Engine choice includes twin-turbocharged V6 and V8 petrol engines, as well as a turbodiesel V6. Production ended in late 2023, with the last model year being 2024 and without successor.

===History===

====Development====
The new Quattroporte was designed at a special Maserati-only department within the Fiat Group Centro Stile design centre, under the guidance of ex-Pininfarina designer Lorenzo Ramaciotti.
Drivetrains, platform, suspension, and body elements such as the front doors are common to the Quattroporte and the smaller Ghibli saloon, which sits on a shorter wheelbase. The Quattroporte is manufactured at the Officine Maserati Grugliasco plant in Grugliasco, near Turin, dedicated to Giovanni Agnelli; this former Bertone plant was acquired by Fiat S.p.A. in 2009 and renovated for production of the two cars.

====Production====

The current-generation of the 
Quattroporte was unveiled at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January 2013. Production started in November 2012. Initially the range included the twin-turbocharged V8 equipped, rear-wheel drive Quattroporte GTS and the entry level Quattroporte equipped with a twin-turbocharged V6 engine; available with Q4 four-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive depending on the market and the choice of the customer. The flagship GTS can be distinguished by its trapezoidal instead of round tail pipes. A V6 turbodiesel model for European markets was introduced in September 2013 at the Frankfurt Motor Show.

In early September 2023, Maserati announced that production of the V8 engine used on the Ghibli (M157) and Quattroporte was to conclude at the end of 2023. Production of the Quattroporte ceased at the end of 2023.

====2015 Quattroporte Zegna Limited Edition====
A total of 100 Quattroporte Zegna Limited editions were produced for worldwide markets in collaboration with Italian fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. This unique model based on the Quattroporte GTS features unique exterior and interior details including a custom platinum-metallic silk paint scheme with aluminium pigments the exterior of the car along with matching colour coordinated 20-inch wheels. On the interior, the seats, panels, roof lining and sunshades are made from specially-milled silk fibers, high performance leather and woolen herringbone fabrics.

====2015====
At the November 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show Maserati introduced the 2015 model year range. The Quattroporte GTS received mild cosmetic updates, such as new multi-spoke forged alloy wheels, colour-matched lower bodywork, and red-accented Maserati logos, while all models were given upgraded standard equipment and ampler trim choice.

2017

For (U.S. model year) 2017, the Quattroporte received a tech update with a new, larger infotainment system, adaptive cruise control, 360 degree cameras and lane-departure warning. 

2018

For (U.S. model year) 2018, the Quattroporte received new headlights and another tech update which added mild-autonomy features such as lane keeping. The autonomous features required a change from hydraulic power steering to electric power steering.

====2019====
In 2019, the Maserati Quattroporte GTS was awarded &quot;Best Luxury Vehicle&quot; by the Washington Automotive Press Association (WAPA), in Washington DC. The sixth generation Quattroporte is considered as one of the fastest relatively depreciating production cars.

2021

For (U.S. model year) 2021, the Quattroporte received a new Trofeo (&quot;trophy&quot; in Italian) top performance trim with a slight power increase. It also received a larger infotainment screen.

====Body and chassis====
The Quattroporte uses a mixed steel and aluminium unibody chassis. The front and rear crash structures, the shock towers, the front wings, all four doors, the bonnet and the boot lid are made of aluminium and the car has a .
The front suspension uses unequal length wishbones with a forged aluminium upright/hub carrier, and an anti-roll bar; the rear suspension consists of a 5-link setup, with four aluminium links and a larger, steel fifth lower arm that also serves as a spring seat.
A front aluminium subframe supports the engine by two mounting points; the steering rack and the lower suspension arms. A rear subframe, made of steel, houses the differential and supports all of the five suspension links. Unlike its predecessors, the new Quattroporte has frameless doors.

The Quattroporte was offered with range of two petrol engines. The Quattroporte GTS features a variant of the F154 engine platform shared with the Ferrari 488, the Portofino and other Ferrari models. The engine is a 3.8-litre 90° twin-turbocharged V8, generating a maximum power output of . The base engine used throughout the trim levels is a 3.0-litre 60° twin-turbocharged V6 generating a maximum power output of . The same engine is shared with the mid-size Ghibli. Both engines are designed and assembled by Ferrari.

The V8 engine used by Maserati differs from the other members of the Ferrari F154 family, in that the Maserati version has a crossplane crankshaft and wet sump lubrication and the turbine housings and exhaust manifolds are integrated in a single piece. The engine also has an overboost function which raises the maximum torque from between 2,000 and 4,000 rpm to between 2,250 and 3,500 rpm.

The V6 engine blocks were cast and machined to Ferrari&#x27;s specifications respectively in Chrysler&#x27;s Kokomo, Indiana and Trenton Engine Plant from where they were then shipped to the Ferrari factory in Modena, Italy for assembly.
Apart from the gasoline engines, a diesel engine is also available in the Quattroporte lineage, a 3.0-litre V6 with a single variable geometry turbocharger, designed and assembled by FCA&#x27;s subsidiary VM Motori.

As of the 2018 model year, the Quattroporte S Q4 was upgraded to raise the maximum power to from its twin-turbocharged V6 engine. The GTS also received a power upgrade and now generates a maximum power output of from its twin-turbocharged V8 engine.

The Quattroporte GTS can accelerate from in 4.2 seconds and can complete the quarter-mile in 12.7 seconds as evident in Car and Driver&#x27;s December 2014 road test.


====Transmission====
All engines are mated to a ZF-supplied 8HP70 8-speed automatic gearbox, with four-wheel drive available on the V6 in left-hand drive markets only.

The V6 four-wheel drive Q4 drivetrain is the same as that in the Ghibli. Attached to the end of the 8-speed transmission is a transfer case, containing an electronically controlled multi-plate wet clutch, which sends power through a drive shaft to an open differential bolted to the oil pan.
During normal operation the car is rear-wheel drive only; when needed the system can divert up of 50% of engine torque to the front wheels.

<text>The Maserati Coupé and Spyder (&quot;Tipo M138&quot;) are a series of grand tourers produced by Italian automaker Maserati from 2001 to 2007. The two nameplates refer to the four-seater coupé and two-seater convertible models, respectively. The design of both models was based on the preceding 3200 GT, which was not sold in the US. Due to the confusing nature of the names &quot;Maserati Coupé&quot; and &quot;Maserati Spyder&quot; (which could refer to any coupé or convertible Maserati has made) the Coupé and Spyder are both commonly referred to as the 4200 GT, which is an evolution of the prior model name and a reference to the increase in engine displacement from 3.2 L (3,217 cc) to 4.2 L (4,244 cc).

The Spyder was first unveiled to the public at the 2001 Frankfurt Auto Show with the Coupé&#x27;s debut following shortly thereafter at the 2002 Detroit Auto Show. Sales in the United States began in March 2002 for the Spyder and in May for the Coupé. The introduction of the Spyder heralded Maserati&#x27;s return to the North American market after an 11-year hiatus. Almost as soon as it was introduced, the Spyder was selected by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the Best GT for 2001.

The Coupé and Spyder were designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro of ItalDesign, who also designed the Ghibli, mid-engined Bora, Quattroporte III and the 3200 GT as well. Interior design was commissioned to Enrico Fumia and was based heavily on the 3200 GT&#x27;s interior, restyled in 1999. The cars were built at the Viale Ciro Menotti plant in Modena, Italy. In total, 13,423 cars were produced before being replaced by the GranTurismo.

==Design==
The Maserati Coupé is a true four-seater capable of comfortably seating two adults in the rear seats. It has a wheelbase of which is about longer than the rival Jaguar XK8 and longer than a Porsche 911 (996). Overall vehicle length is , width is , and height is . Total curb weight is . The design is similar to the preceding 3200 GT but the boomerang shaped taillights were replaced in favour of more conventional units.

The Maserati Spyder is a soft-top convertible and features a top that is electronically operated by a pushbutton on the center console. The top automatically stows beneath a hard cover that sits flush with the body in front of the boot. Both deployment and stowage of the top takes about 30 seconds. Arch-type roll bars are provided behind each seat. The Spyder&#x27;s wheelbase is shorter than the Coupé&#x27;s. Overall length is , width , and height . Curb weight is .

In late 2004, the Coupé and Spyder underwent a minor facelift. This meant a new, somewhat larger grille with its lower edge pulled somewhat lower into the lower lip of the front bumper was installed. The Spyder also got a glass rear window in 2003 instead of the standard plastic material. The new grille also features horizontal bars, while the 1963 style oval Maserati logo “Saetta” now mounted on the C-pillars, and a new air outlet (as per GranSport versions) featured with a new rear bumper.


==Specifications==
The Maserati Coupé and Spyder utilise the same vehicle systems – engine, transmission, suspension, and interior driver and front passenger controls and safety equipment. Their performance specifications are almost identical, with some reviewers claiming that the Coupé has better performance due to its lesser weight and more rigid body structure, while others measured faster performance from the Spyder. Both models came standard with 18 inch alloy wheels that originally had a 15-spoke design, but after 2003 most buyers chose the optional 7-spoke sport wheels which became standard by 2005. Maserati offered sixteen exterior colours, ten shades of leather interior along with the ability to select among colours for various interior details such as the piping and stitching used. Five colours for the Spyder&#x27;s convertible top were also offered.

===Engine===
Both models utilize the &quot;F136 R&quot; V8 belonging to the Ferrari-Maserati F136 engine family; it displaces 4,244 cc and is rated at at 7,000 rpm with a peak torque of at 4,500 rpm.

Significant changes from the prior 3200 GT engine were the larger displacement resulting from an increased cylinder bore diameter and the move to a naturally aspirated intake system which replaced the twin-turbocharged induction approach Maserati had used for the previous 20 years, fundamentally because the powertrain was now Ferrari based. The crankshaft is of crossplane design. The engine operates at a compression ratio of 11.1:1 with the eight cylinders configured in a 90° V design. The cylinder bore diameter is and piston stroke length is . The engine shares many of the design features of modern racing engines, including dry sump lubrication, a pump assembly located outside the crankcase, and four valves per cylinder. The 32-valve DOHC utilises chain-driven, twin-overhead camshafts that provide valve actuation in less than 0.15 seconds, with the intake cams being controlled by variable valve timing. The crankcase and cylinder heads are made from an aluminium and silicon alloy, giving the engine a relatively light weight of .

===Transmission===

The manual transmission is a six-speed unit that was available either as a GT or CC (Cambiocorsa) using paddle shifters. The GT version utilises a foot-operated clutch, whereas the Cambiocorsa (Italian, meaning &quot;race shift”) is an automated manual transmission. It uses a Formula One-type gearbox, built by Graziano Trasmissioni, with hydraulic operation and electronic management operated by F1-style paddles behind the steering wheel, similar to the system used in Ferrari sports cars. The system allows the driver to choose between four different operating modes: Normal, Sport, Auto and Low Grip. Each of these programs is selected by means of console-mounted buttons, corresponding to different types of operating mode. By switching between the Normal and Sport modes, the driver can select between different electronic stability control settings and, if installed, different active suspension settings. Normal mode provides a more comfortable ride, whereas Sport mode stiffens up the suspension and provides fast gear shifts of around a quarter of a second. Automatic mode electronically handles shifting of the transmission, but allows the driver to rapidly revert to manual using the F1-style paddles. The Low Grip, or Ice mode, allows for smooth starting and gear changes on snow and ice.

The transmission is of a transaxle type and located at the rear of the vehicle. It is integrated in with the differential, unlike its predecessor. This gives both the Coupé and Spyder a 48/52% weight distribution between the front and rear axles.

===Suspension===
The Maserati Coupé and Spyder both have a light alloy double wishbone suspension. The rear suspension is fitted with a toe-in regulator bar which enhances the precision of the drive train and provides balanced cornering. The front suspension layout incorporates “anti-dive” features to prevent nose-diving when braking. The suspension system is completed by front and rear anti-roll bars.

Perhaps the most highly regarded option is a computer-controlled suspension damping system called &quot;Skyhook&quot;. This adaptive damping system uses coil-over shock absorbers and a set of six accelerometers that continually monitor the movement of the wheels along with the car&#x27;s body and transmits this information to a control unit. The vehicle&#x27;s computer analyses this data and coordinates it with the Cambiocorsa transmission and other Maserati safety systems. Skyhook then calculates, and recalculates the data at least 40 times per second and instantaneously adjusts each shock absorber accordingly. When placed in the Sport mode, the suspension firms up for better cornering.

===Safety===
Both models are equipped with front and side driver and passenger airbags as well as seat belt pre-tensioners. Driving stability is provided by Maserati Stability Program (MSP) which became standard on the 2004 models and controls the engine and brakes to help the driver control the vehicle in extreme driving situations. The MSP system integrates four different vehicle systems - the anti-slip regulation traction control (ASR), the motor spin regulation (MSR), electronic brake force distribution (EBD), and anti-lock braking system (ABS). The wheels employ a high-performance Brembo braking system with light alloy four-piston calipers and cross-drilled large ventilating 
brake discs.

===Interior===
The Coupé and Spyder came standard with an infotainment system present on the centre console that combines audio and climate controls. An optional GPS navigation system and hands-free GSM phone were also available as options integrated into the infotainment system. Additional optional equipment includes xenon headlights, upgraded audio system and CD changer, electrochromic rear view mirror, rear parking sensors, seat heaters, and cruise control. Various interior trim packages were offered, including a leather headliner featuring a grosgrain pattern, and either a carbon fibre kit or Briar wood kit sporting wood portions of the steering wheel, door trim, and shifter. Purchasers could even order custom Maserati luggage, made to match their car&#x27;s interiors.


==Maserati GranSport==
The Maserati GranSport is a sportier version of the Coupé that was first unveiled at the March 2004 Geneva Motor Show. It featured improved aerodynamics, retuned suspension, engine and transmission, and a sportier interior. Frank Stephenson, as newly appointed Director of Ferrari-Maserati Concept Design and Development, was responsible for exterior and interior redesign. An open-top GranSport Spyder with similar modifications was introduced a year later, at the September 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show.

It is powered by the same 4,244 cc, dry sump, 90° V8 engine used on the standard Coupé and Spyder. However, the engine is rated at at 7,000 rpm due primarily to a different exhaust system and improvements on the intake manifolds and valve seats. Only the six-speed &quot;Cambiocorsa&quot; paddle shift transmission was offered, and was recalibrated for quicker shifts. The exhaust, equipped with bypass valves, was also specially tuned to &quot;growl&quot; on start-up and full throttle.
The GranSport used the Skyhook active suspension, with a lower ride height. Other than height, the exterior dimensions and curb weight were unchanged from the Cambiocorsa Coupé and Spyder.
The GranSport had a claimed top speed of , and a acceleration time of 4.85 seconds.

The higher top speed was possible due to a taller sixth gear ratio and more aerodynamic body cladding. New bumpers, side skirts, rear lip spoiler and underbody panels lowered the drag coefficient by 0.02 to 0.33 and simultaneously reduced lift.
Chrome mesh grilles to the front and rear bumpers, and &quot;Trofeo&quot;-design 19-inch wheels with trident-shaped spokes were other distinguishing exterior features.

Inside, the GranSport was fitted with wide, highly contoured sport seats, which required a slimmer centre console (constructed in carbon fibre) and elastic door pockets. Carbon fibre was also used to for the dashboard trim and on the new thick-rimmed steering wheel. On the coupé, the upholstery materials were leather and technical cloth (in black, Nickel Gray or Metal Blue) on the seat centres, backs and dashboard fascia; the Spyder had an all-leather interior. Seven paint colours were available: solid Giallo Granturismo and Rosso Mondiale, metallic Nero Carbonio, Blu Mediterraneo, Grigio Alfieri and Grigio Touring, and special triple-layer white Bianco Fuji.

=== GS Zagato ===
The limited production Maserati GS Zagato was introduced by Zagato at the 2007 Concorso d&#x27;Eleganza Villa d&#x27;Este. Its design is inspired by the 1954 Maserati A6G Berlinetta Zagato. Cars were based on a shorter GranSport Spyder chassis with aluminium bodywork designed by Norihiko Harada. The two-seater coupé was commissioned by a Maserati CEO, Karl-Heinz Kalbfell and in total only nine units were created.

=== A8GCS Berlinetta ===
The A8GCS Berlinetta is a concept car based on the Maserati GranSport from coachbuilder Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera, presented in 2009.

==Maserati Trofeo==
The Maserati Trofeo is a racing version of the Coupé that was introduced in 2003. It utilises the standard engine of the coupé that is rated at due to a revised engine mapping and a modified free-flowing exhaust that uses a baffle-free muffler. Vehicle weight was reduced by as a result of many comfort oriented components being stripped out: soundproofing, air conditioning, and the leather interior were left out, with the regular seats being replaced by racing seats. Carbon-fibre doors and hood replaced the standard car&#x27;s steel components, and plexiglass replaced the side window glass. The result is a 0- acceleration time of 4.0 seconds. A Trofeo racing series was organized for enthusiasts, with a per-race rental charge of about US$20,000. For the 2005 season of the race, the Coupé-based Trofeo was updated and since based on GranSport model.

A Trofeo Light (or simply the Maserati Light) was also developed for use in various national and international racing series, including the Italian GT Championship, Rolex Sports Car Series, and FIA GT3 European Championship. It is distinguishable from the &quot;Trofeo&quot; by having a wider flared wheel-arches with air-exhaust behind front wheels and wider rear spoiler.
==Special editions==
The Maserati Coupé and Spyder special editions are primarily exterior trim packages that were only offered for certain model years or on a limited number of vehicles. They include:
* 2004 &#x27;Spyder 90th Anniversary&#x27;
* GranSport &#x27;Limited Edition&#x27;
* 2006 GranSport &#x27;MC Victory&#x27;
* 2006 GranSport &#x27;Contemporary Classic&#x27;
* 2007 GranSport &#x27;Maserati and Cornes 10th Anniversary&#x27;

Also, in 2004, a Vintage trim package was introduced. It includes chrome air-exhaust vents in the front fenders, a new polished wheel design, silver-finished brake calipers, and chrome door handles. The front fender vents were intended to evoke those of the 1957 3500 GT.

A 2004 Coupé 90th Anniversary edition was announced, but apparently never produced.

The &#x27;Spyder 90th Anniversary&#x27; was shown in late 2004 and produced in the limited number of 90 cars for North America and another 90 cars for the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;maserati.us/Spyder 90th Anniversary&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 15 were in right-hand drive, mainly for Britain. This edition is not a GranSport but a regular Spyder model that is visually based on the GranSport bodykit (without power upgrades), and may be recognised by its oval Maserati badges on the front fenders, titanium coloured brake calipers, grey headlamp housings and a special blue/grey interior with limited edition plaque. The headrests also received aerodynamic fairings behind the rollover bars. Special &quot;Blu Anniversary&quot; paint could be chosen.

The &#x27;MC Victory&#x27; edition features details made out of carbon fibre like: front splitter, racing seats and rear nolder. Centre console bears the limited edition plaque and there are Italian flag emblems embedded into front fenders. Most cars were chosen in exclusive &quot;Blu Victory&quot; paint. It was unveiled at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show to celebrate the racing success of the MC12 GT1. Only 181 cars were made.&lt;ref name=&quot;maserati.us/GranSport MC Victory&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A &#x27;Limited Edition&#x27;, destined for US market is recognizable for the “Saetta” logo featuring the Trident with red accents and oval Maserati badges on front fenders. Minor upgrades for the interior, including an &quot;Auditorium 200&quot; sound system and full leather headliner were included.

The GranSport &#x27;Contemporary Classic&#x27; was offered in 4 basic colours with interior piping around the seats and dashboard matching with body paint. Also recognisable by light blue dials.

GranSport &#x27;Maserati and Cornes 10th Anniversary&#x27;, 35 units were made to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Japanese importer Cornes &amp; Co. cooperation with Maserati. It was available in black or white with beige or blue interior respectively. Front fenders sport the same Italian flag emblem as MC Victory. Interior features include a limited edition plaque, but without numbering, and light blue dials.

== Maserati 420 Super Monoposto ==

The Maserati 420 Super Monoposto is a one-off RHD car inspired by the 2001 Maserati 320S concept. It was revealed in July 2016 at the Brooklands Motor Museum.

<doc id="1245357" wikidata="Q1012774" url="?curid=1245357" title="Guča">
<text>Guča (Serbian Cyrillic: Гуча, pronounced ) is a small town near the city of Čačak, located in the Lučani municipality, Moravica District, in the Dragačevo region of western Serbia. As of 2011 census, it has a population of 3,710 inhabitants. It is famous for its annual Guča trumpet festival, which is held in town and is attended by several hundred thousand visitors each year.

==Administrative divisions==
Guča was a separate municipality until 1965, when it was incorporated into the municipality of Lučani. For census purposes, Guča is divided into two adjacent settlements, northern Guča (selo) (lit. Guča Village, population 1,955) and southern Guča (varošica) (lit. Guča Town, 1,755), separated by the Bjelica river.

==Guča trumpet festival==
The city&#x27;s Guča trumpet festival, also known as the Dragačevo Assembly is an annual trumpet festival which began in 1961, starting our as a Dragacevo assembly of trumpet players who gathered in a local churchyard. 900,000 visitors (estimation by the promoter) make their way to the town of 2,000 people every year, both from Serbia and abroad. Elimination heats earlier in the year mean only a few dozen bands get to compete. Guča’s official festival is split into three parts. Friday’s opening concert, Saturday night celebrations and Sunday’s competition. Friday’s concerts are held at the entrance to the official Guča Festival building. This event features previous winners, each orkestar getting to play three tunes while folk dancers, all kitted out in bright knitting patterns, dance kolos and oros in front of a hyped-up audience.

In 2010, Guča celebrated its 50th anniversary and it was opened by the then Serbian President Boris Tadić.

<doc id="1245358" wikidata="Q1796488" url="?curid=1245358" title="Weaver rail mount">
<text>A Weaver rail mount is a system to connect telescopic sights (often via a scope mount) and other accessories to firearms and certain crossbows. It uses a pair of parallel rails and several slots perpendicular to these rails.

The later Picatinny rail, developed by the US military, is a development of the key concepts of the Weaver system, and they are partially compatible.

==History==
The Weaver mount was developed by William Ralph Weaver (1905 – 8 November 1975) at his telescopic sight company W.R. Weaver Co., which he founded in 1930. Previous systems included the Leupold/Redfield mounts. Compared to the Leupold mount, the Weaver rail is not as strong and cannot be adjusted for windage.

W.R. Weaver Co. became Weaver Optics, and was a subsidiary of Meade Instruments Corporation from 2002 to 2008, when it was on-sold to become part of Alliant Techsystems&#x27;s Security and Sporting division in Onalaska, Wisconsin.

==Features==
Older Weaver systems used two pieces mounted a distance apart from one another, typically on the receiver of a rifle over the bolt opening, where the cartridge would be inserted and/or ejected. However, alignment problems of the two piece system can put undue stress on a rifle scope and cause problems between the scope and rifle barrel parallels and bullet Point Of Impact (POI). The two piece system must be mounted with exacting tolerances to ensure perfect alignment, using a scope alignment device called Alignment Sleeves. 

The two piece type can be problematic on some rifles that do not allow for the two pieces to be mounted due to metal thickness of the receiver, or other issues of receiver length that will not allow for proper distance to hold the scope. With the later one piece approach, the rail system remains consistent in alignment.

The slots on a Weaver system are primarily used as a clearance of the locking screw that tightens the clamp to the rail. Some Weaver-type accessories have a bar that fits inside the machined slots on the rails while many others do not.

Weaver rails have a slot width of 0.180 in (4.57 mm), but are not necessarily consistent in the spacing of slot centers.

==Failings==
The lack of a locking bar on many Weaver-type accessories lends to another alignment issue: side-to-side canting. Although this issue is not common, it can be very problematic especially with scopes. Because scopes need to be mounted to a rifle in perfect parallel to the barrel, and to ensure the cross hairs indicate a point of aim (POA) exactly at a bullet&#x27;s point of impact (POI) at a known distance, a small variation of even one quarter of one degree can cause massive problems at longer ranges. The locking bar holds the mount in a perfect 90 degrees to the rail system, whereas a non-locking bar system can cant to the left or right. 

This canting, sometimes called jamming of surfaces, is caused by not matching the clamping surface perfectly to the rail. When tightened down, stress exerted on the base can cause the scope&#x27;s POA to be off from the POI by as much as several feet at 100–200 yards, and gets progressively worse with greater distance. Lower grade materials used in manufacturing of scope bases, inconsistent design tolerances from one manufacturer to another, and other factors can cause twisting stress and cause the mount to move out of parallel with the rifle barrel. The locking bar system allows for even stress to be distributed and prevent canting of the scope mount.

Another form of scope canting is caused by the rings themselves. Many Weaver-type mounts, including many Picatinny-type scope rings and even the Redfield Type, have either two or four screws on top of the scope ring that hold the scope in place. Both the Weaver and Picatinny clamp systems have a screw side and a clamp side. With the two-screw style, the ring usually aligns well but does not have the strength of the four screw system. Many times, when tightening the screws of the four screw type, the scope can twist in place, causing misalignment. Tightening the mounts in an “X” pattern and usually starting opposite of the outside clamp side. Holding the scope slightly to the opposite side while tightening the screws usually allows for proper alignment of the scope to barrel parallel.

==Compatibility with Picatinny==
The military standard, MIL-STD-1913 &quot;Picatinny rails&quot; date from the mid-1990s and have very strict military standard dimensions and tolerances.
The Picatinny rail has a similar profile to the Weaver, but the recoil groove width of the Picatinny rail is 0.206 in (5.23 mm) versus 0.180 in (4.57 mm) of the Weaver rail/mount, and by contrast with the Weaver, the spacing of the Picatinny recoil groove centers is consistent, at 0.394 in (10.01 mm).

Many rail-grabber-mounted accessories can be used on either type of rail, and accessories designed for a Weaver system will always (SWP) fit Picatinny rails – although not &quot;vice versa&quot; because the Picatinny locking slot width is vs the .180 width of the Weaver, and the spacing of slot centers is . Because of this, with devices that use only one locking slot, Weaver devices will fit on Picatinny rails, but Picatinny devices will not always fit on Weaver rails.

Another difference is that Weaver rails are continuous with only two to four recoil grooves cut, while Picatinny rails have recoil grooves cut across the entire length of the rail at the above noted spacing (like a dotted line). This allows for more mounting position flexibility and also helps to neutralize expansion caused by barrel heating.

<doc id="1245372" wikidata="Q485202" url="?curid=1245372" title="Analytic hierarchy process">
<text>In the theory of decision making, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), also analytical hierarchy process, is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions, based on mathematics and psychology. It was developed by Thomas L. Saaty in the 1970s; Saaty partnered with Ernest Forman to develop &quot;Expert Choice&quot; software in 1983, and AHP has been extensively studied and refined since then. It represents an accurate approach to quantifying the weights of decision criteria. Individual experts’ experiences are utilized to estimate the relative magnitudes of factors through pair-wise comparisons. Each of the respondents compares the relative importance of each pair of items using a specially designed questionnaire. The relative importance of the criteria can be determined with the help of the AHP by comparing the criteria and, if applicable, the sub-criteria in pairs by experts or decision-makers. On this basis, the best alternative can be found.

==Uses and applications==
AHP is targeted at group decision making, and is used for decision situations, in fields such as government, business, industry, healthcare and education.

Rather than prescribing a &quot;correct&quot; decision, the AHP helps decision makers find the decision that best suits their goal and their understanding of the problem. It provides a comprehensive and rational framework for structuring a decision problem, for representing and quantifying its elements, for relating those elements to overall goals, and for evaluating alternative solutions.

Users of the AHP first decompose their decision problem into a hierarchy of more easily comprehended sub-problems, each of which can be analyzed independently. The elements of the hierarchy can relate to any aspect of the decision problem—tangible or intangible, carefully measured or roughly estimated, well or poorly understood—anything at all that applies to the decision at hand.

Once the hierarchy is built, the decision makers evaluate its various elements by comparing them to each other two at a time, with respect to their impact on an element above them in the hierarchy. In making the comparisons, the decision makers can use concrete data about the elements, and they can also use their judgments about the elements&#x27; relative meaning and importance. Human judgments, and not just the underlying information, can be used in performing the evaluations.

The AHP converts these evaluations to numerical values that can be processed and compared over the entire range of the problem. A numerical weight or priority is derived for each element of the hierarchy, allowing diverse and often incommensurable elements to be compared to one another in a rational and consistent way. This capability distinguishes the AHP from other decision making techniques.

In the final step of the process, numerical priorities are calculated for each of the decision alternatives. These numbers represent the alternatives&#x27; relative ability to achieve the decision goal, so they allow a straightforward consideration of the various courses of action.

While it can be used by individuals working on straightforward decisions, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is most useful where teams of people are working on complex problems, especially those with high stakes, involving human perceptions and judgments, whose resolutions have long-term repercussions.

Decision situations to which the AHP can be applied include:
* Choice – The selection of one alternative from a given set of alternatives, usually where there are multiple decision criteria involved.
* Ranking – Putting a set of alternatives in order from most to least desirable. 
* Prioritization – Determining the relative merit of members of a set of alternatives, as opposed to selecting a single one or merely ranking them
* Resource allocation – Apportioning resources among a set of alternatives
* Benchmarking – Comparing the processes in one&#x27;s own organization with those of other best-of-breed organizations
* Quality management – Dealing with the multidimensional aspects of quality and quality improvement

The applications of AHP include planning, resource allocation, priority setting, and selection among alternatives. Other areas have included forecasting, total quality management, business process reengineering, quality function deployment, and the balanced scorecard. Other uses of AHP are discussed in the literature:

*Deciding how best to reduce the impact of global climate change (&quot;Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei&quot;)
*Quantifying the overall quality of software systems (&quot;Microsoft Corporation&quot;)
*Selecting university faculty (&quot;Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania&quot;)
*Deciding where to locate offshore manufacturing plants (&quot;University of Cambridge&quot;)
*Assessing risk in operating cross-country petroleum pipelines (&quot;American Society of Civil Engineers&quot;)
*Deciding how best to manage U.S. watersheds (&quot;U.S. Department of Agriculture&quot;)
*More Effectively Define and Evaluate SAP Implementation Approaches (SAP Experts)
* Integrated evaluation of a community&#x27;s sustanaibility in terms of environment, economy, society, institution, and culture.
* Accelerated Bridge Construction Decision Making Tool to assist in determining the viability of accelerated bridge construction (ABC) over traditional construction methods and in selecting appropriate construction and contracting strategies on a case-by-case basis.

AHP is sometimes used in designing highly specific procedures for particular situations, such as the rating of buildings by historical significance. It was recently applied to a project that uses video footage to assess the condition of highways in Virginia. Highway engineers first used it to determine the optimum scope of the project, and then to justify its budget to lawmakers.

The weights of the AHP judgement matrix may be corrected with the ones calculated through the Entropy Method. This variant of the AHP method is called AHP-EM.

==Education and scholarly research==
Though using the analytic hierarchy process requires no specialized academic training, it is considered an important subject in many institutions of higher learning, including schools of engineering and graduate schools of business. It is a particularly important subject in the quality field, and is taught in many specialized courses including Six Sigma, Lean Six Sigma, and QFD.

The International Symposium on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (ISAHP) holds biennial meetings of academics and practitioners interested in the field. A wide range of topics is covered. Those in 2005 ranged from &quot;Establishing Payment Standards for Surgical Specialists&quot;, to &quot;Strategic Technology Roadmapping&quot;, to &quot;Infrastructure Reconstruction in Devastated Countries&quot;.
At the 2007 meeting in Valparaíso, Chile, 90 papers were presented from 19 countries, including the US, Germany, Japan, Chile, Malaysia, and Nepal. A similar number of papers were presented at the 2009 symposium in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, when 28 countries were represented. Subjects of the papers included &quot;Economic Stabilization in Latvia&quot;, &quot;Portfolio Selection in the Banking Sector&quot;, &quot;Wildfire Management to Help Mitigate Global Warming&quot;, and &quot;Rural Microprojects in Nepal&quot;.

==Use==
As can be seen in the material that follows, using the AHP involves the mathematical synthesis of numerous judgments about the decision problem at hand. It is not uncommon for these judgments to number in the dozens or even the hundreds. While the math can be done by hand or with a calculator, it is far more common to use one of several computerized methods for entering and synthesizing the judgments. The simplest of these involve standard spreadsheet software, while the most complex use custom software, often augmented by special devices for acquiring the judgments of decision makers gathered in a meeting room.

The procedure for using the AHP can be summarized as:

#Model the problem as a hierarchy containing the decision goal, the alternatives for reaching it, and the criteria for evaluating the alternatives.
#Establish priorities among the elements of the hierarchy by making a series of judgments based on pairwise comparisons of the elements. For example, when comparing potential purchases of commercial real estate, the investors might say they prefer location over price and price over timing.
#Synthesize these judgments to yield a set of overall priorities for the hierarchy. This would combine the investors&#x27; judgments about location, price and timing for properties A, B, C, and D into overall priorities for each property.
#Check the consistency of the judgments.
#Come to a final decision based on the results of this process.

These steps are more fully described below.

===Model the problem as a hierarchy===
The first step in the analytic hierarchy process is to model the problem as a hierarchy. In doing this, participants explore the aspects of the problem at levels from general to detailed, then express it in the multileveled way that the AHP requires. As they work to build the hierarchy, they increase their understanding of the problem, of its context, and of each other&#x27;s thoughts and feelings about both.

====Hierarchies defined====
A hierarchy is a stratified system of ranking and organizing people, things, ideas, etc., where each element of the system, except for the top one, is subordinate to one or more other elements. Though the concept of hierarchy is easily grasped intuitively, it can also be described mathematically. Diagrams of hierarchies are often shaped roughly like pyramids, but other than having a single element at the top, there is nothing necessarily pyramid-shaped about a hierarchy.

Human organizations are often structured as hierarchies, where the hierarchical system is used for assigning responsibilities, exercising leadership, and facilitating communication. Familiar hierarchies of &quot;things&quot; include a desktop computer&#x27;s tower unit at the &quot;top&quot;, with its subordinate monitor, keyboard, and mouse &quot;below.&quot;

In the world of ideas, we use hierarchies to help us acquire detailed knowledge of complex reality: we structure the reality into its constituent parts, and these in turn into their own constituent parts, proceeding down the hierarchy as many levels as we care to. At each step, we focus on understanding a single component of the whole, temporarily disregarding the other components at this and all other levels. As we go through this process, we increase our global understanding of whatever complex reality we are studying.

Think of the hierarchy that medical students use while learning anatomy—they separately consider the musculoskeletal system (including parts and subparts like the hand and its constituent muscles and bones), the circulatory system (and its many levels and branches), the nervous system (and its numerous components and subsystems), etc., until they&#x27;ve covered all the systems and the important subdivisions of each. Advanced students continue the subdivision all the way to the level of the cell or molecule. In the end, the students understand the &quot;big picture&quot; and a considerable number of its details. Not only that, but they understand the relation of the individual parts to the whole. By working hierarchically, they&#x27;ve gained a comprehensive understanding of anatomy.

Similarly, when we approach a complex decision problem, we can use a hierarchy to integrate large amounts of information into our understanding of the situation. As we build this information structure, we form a better and better picture of the problem as a whole.

====Hierarchies in the AHP====
An AHP hierarchy is a structured means of modeling the decision at hand. It consists of an overall goal, a group of options or alternatives for reaching the goal, and a group of factors or criteria that relate the alternatives to the goal. The criteria can be further broken down into subcriteria, sub-subcriteria, and so on, in as many levels as the problem requires. A criterion may not apply uniformly, but may have graded differences like a little sweetness is enjoyable but too much sweetness can be harmful. In that case, the criterion is divided into subcriteria indicating different intensities of the criterion, like: little, medium, high and these intensities are prioritized through comparisons under the parent criterion, sweetness.
Published descriptions of AHP applications often include diagrams and descriptions of their hierarchies; some simple ones are shown throughout this article. More complex AHP hierarchies have been collected and reprinted in at least one book. More complex hierarchies can be found .

The design of any AHP hierarchy will depend not only on the nature of the problem at hand, but also on the knowledge, judgments, values, opinions, needs, wants, etc. of the participants in the decision-making process. Constructing a hierarchy typically involves significant discussion, research, and discovery by those involved. Even after its initial construction, it can be changed to accommodate newly-thought-of criteria or criteria not originally considered to be important; alternatives can also be added, deleted, or changed.

To better understand AHP hierarchies, consider a decision problem with a goal to be reached, three alternative ways of reaching the goal, and four criteria against which the alternatives need to be measured.

Such a hierarchy can be visualized as a diagram like the one immediately below, with the goal at the top, the three alternatives at the bottom, and the four criteria in between. There are useful terms for describing the parts of such diagrams: Each box is called a node. A node that is connected to one or more nodes in a level below it is called a parent node. The nodes to which it is so connected are called its children.

Applying these definitions to the diagram below, the goal is the parent of the four criteria, and the four criteria are children of the goal. Each criterion is a parent of the three Alternatives. Note that there are only three Alternatives, but in the diagram, each of them is repeated under each of its parents.

To reduce the size of the drawing required, it is common to represent AHP hierarchies as shown in the diagram below, with only one node for each alternative, and with multiple lines connecting the alternatives and the criteria that apply to them. To avoid clutter, these lines are sometimes omitted or reduced in number. Regardless of any such simplifications in the diagram, in the actual hierarchy each criterion is individually connected to the alternatives. The lines may be thought of as being directed downward from the parent in one level to its children in the level below.

===Evaluate the hierarchy===
Once the hierarchy has been constructed, the participants analyze it through a series of pairwise comparisons that derive numerical scales of measurement for the nodes. The criteria are pairwise compared against the goal for importance. The alternatives are pairwise compared against each of the criteria for preference. The comparisons are processed mathematically, and priorities are derived for each node.

Consider the &quot;Choose a Leader&quot; example above. An important task of the decision makers is to determine the weight to be given each criterion in making the choice of a leader. Another important task is to determine the weight to be given to each candidate with regard to each of the criteria. The AHP not only lets them do that, but it lets them put a meaningful and objective numerical value on each of the four criteria.

Unlike most surveys which adopt the five point Likert scale, AHP&#x27;s questionnaire is 9 to 1 to 9.

===Establish priorities===
This section explains priorities, shows how they are established, and provides a simple example.

====Priorities defined and explained====
Priorities are numbers associated with the nodes of an AHP hierarchy. They represent the relative weights of the nodes in any group.

Like probabilities, priorities are absolute numbers between zero and one, without units or dimensions. A node with priority .200 has twice the weight in reaching the goal as one with priority .100, ten times the weight of one with priority .020, and so forth. Depending on the problem at hand, &quot;weight&quot; can refer to importance, or preference, or likelihood, or whatever factor is being considered by the decision makers.

Priorities are distributed over a hierarchy according to its architecture, and their values depend on the information entered by users of the process. Priorities of the Goal, the Criteria, and the Alternatives are intimately related, but need to be considered separately.

By definition, the priority of the Goal is 1.000. The priorities of the alternatives always add up to 1.000. Things can become complicated with multiple levels of Criteria, but if there is only one level, their priorities also add to 1.000. All this is illustrated by the priorities in the example below.

Observe that the priorities on each level of the example—the goal, the criteria, and the alternatives—all add up to 1.000.

The priorities shown are those that exist before any information has been entered about weights of the criteria or alternatives, so the priorities within each level are all equal. They are called the hierarchy&#x27;s default priorities. If a fifth Criterion were added to this hierarchy, the default priority for each Criterion would be .200. If there were only two Alternatives, each would have a default priority of .500.

Two additional concepts apply when a hierarchy has more than one level of criteria: local priorities and global priorities. Consider the hierarchy shown below, which has several Subcriteria under each Criterion.

The local priorities, shown in gray, represent the relative weights of the nodes within a group of siblings with respect to their parent. The local priorities of each group of Criteria and their sibling Subcriteria add up to 1.000. The global priorities, shown in black, are obtained by multiplying the local priorities of the siblings by their parent&#x27;s global priority. The global priorities for all the subcriteria in the level add up to 1.000.

The rule is this: Within a hierarchy, the global priorities of child nodes always add up to the global priority of their parent. Within a group of children, the local priorities add up to 1.000.

So far, we have looked only at default priorities. As the Analytical Hierarchy Process moves forward, the priorities will change from their default values as the decision makers input information about the importance of the various nodes. They do this by making a series of pairwise comparisons.

==Practical examples==
Experienced practitioners know that the best way to understand the AHP is to work through cases and examples. Two detailed case studies, specifically designed as in-depth teaching examples, are provided as appendices to this article:

* Simple step-by-step example with four Criteria and three Alternatives: Choosing a leader for an organization.
* More complex step-by-step example with ten Criteria/Subcriteria and six Alternatives: Buying a family car and Machinery Selection Example.

Some of the books on AHP contain practical examples of its use, though they are not typically intended to be step-by-step learning aids. One of them contains a handful of expanded examples, plus about 400 AHP hierarchies briefly described and illustrated with figures. Many examples are discussed, mostly for professional audiences, in papers published by the International Symposium on the Analytic Hierarchy Process.

==Criticisms==
The AHP is included in most operations research and management science textbooks, and is taught in numerous universities; it is used extensively in organizations that have carefully investigated its theoretical underpinnings. The method does have its critics. 
In the early 1990s a series of debates between critics and proponents of AHP was published in &quot;Management Science&quot; and &quot;The Journal of the Operational Research Society,&quot; two prestigious journals where Saaty and his colleagues had considerable influence. These debates seem to have been settled in favor of AHP: 
*An in-depth paper was published in &quot;Operations Research&quot; in 2001.
*A 2008 &quot;Management Science&quot; paper reviewing 15 years of progress in all areas of Multicriteria Decision Making
* in 2008, the major society for operations research, the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences formally recognized AHP&#x27;s broad impact on its fields.

A 1997 paper examined possible flaws in the verbal (vs. numerical) scale often used in AHP pairwise comparisons. Another from the same year claimed that innocuous changes to the AHP model can introduce order where no order exists. A 2006 paper found that the addition of criteria for which all alternatives perform equally can alter the priorities of alternatives.

In 2021, the first comprehensive evaluation of the AHP was published in a book authored by two academics from Technical University of Valencia and Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena, and published by Springer Nature. Based on an empirical investigation and objective testimonies by 101 researchers, the study found at least 30 flaws in the AHP and found it unsuitable for complex problems, and in certain situations even for small problems.

==Rank reversal==
Decision making involves ranking alternatives in terms of criteria or attributes of those alternatives. It is an axiom of some decision theories that when new alternatives are added to a decision problem, the ranking of the old alternatives must not change — that &quot;rank reversal&quot; must not occur.

There are two schools of thought about rank reversal. One maintains that new alternatives that introduce no additional attributes should not cause rank reversal under any circumstances. The other maintains that there are some situations in which rank reversal can reasonably be expected. The original formulation of AHP allowed rank reversals. In 1993, Forman introduced a second AHP synthesis mode, called the ideal synthesis mode, to address choice situations in which the addition or removal of an &#x27;irrelevant&#x27; alternative should not and will not cause a change in the ranks of existing alternatives. The current version of the AHP can accommodate both these schools—its ideal mode preserves rank, while its distributive mode allows the ranks to change. Either mode is selected according to the problem at hand.

Rank reversal and AHP are extensively discussed in a 2001 paper in &quot;Operations Research&quot;, as well as a chapter entitled &quot;Rank Preservation and Reversal&quot;, in the current basic book on AHP. The latter presents published examples of rank reversal due to adding copies and near copies of an alternative, due to intransitivity of decision rules, due to adding phantom and decoy alternatives, and due to the switching phenomenon in utility functions. It also discusses the Distributive and Ideal Modes of AHP.

A new form of rank reversal of AHP was found in 2014 in which AHP produces rank order reversal when eliminating irrelevant data, this is data that do not differentiate alternatives.

There are different types of rank reversals. Also, other methods besides the AHP may exhibit such rank reversals. More discussion on rank reversals with the AHP and other MCDM methods is provided in the rank reversals in decision-making page.

==Non-monotonicity of some weight extraction methods==

Within a comparison matrix one may replace a judgement with a less favorable judgment and then check to see if the indication of the new priority becomes less favorable than the original priority. In the context of tournament matrices, it has been proven by Oskar Perron that the principal right eigenvector method is not monotonic. This behaviour can also be demonstrated for reciprocal n x n matrices, where n &gt; 3. Alternative approaches are discussed elsewhere.

<text>5α-Reductases, also known as 3-oxo-5α-steroid 4-dehydrogenases, are enzymes involved in steroid metabolism. They participate in three metabolic pathways: bile acid biosynthesis, androgen and estrogen metabolism. There are three isozymes of 5α-reductase encoded by the genes SRD5A1, SRD5A2, and SRD5A3.

5α-Reductases catalyze the following generalized chemical reaction:

:a 3-oxo-5α-steroid + acceptor a 3-oxo-Δ4-steroid + reduced acceptor

Where a 3-oxo-5α-steroid and acceptor are substrates, and a corresponding 3-oxo-Δ4-steroid and the reduced acceptor are products. An instance of this generalized reaction that 5α-reductase type 2 catalyzes is:

:dihydrotestosterone + NADP+ formula_1 testosterone + NADPH + H+

where dihydrotestosterone is the 3-oxo-5α-steroid, NADP+ is the acceptor and testosterone is the 3-oxo-Δ4-steroid and NADPH the reduced acceptor.

==Production and activity==
The enzyme is produced in many tissues in both males and females, in the reproductive tract, testes and ovaries, skin, seminal vesicles, prostate, epididymis and many organs, including the nervous system. There are three isoenzymes of 5α-reductase: steroid 5α-reductase 1, 2, and 3 (SRD5A1, SRD5A2 and SRD5A3).

5α-Reductases act on 3-oxo (3-keto), Δ4,5 C19/C21 steroids as its substrates; &quot;3-keto&quot; refers to the double bond of the third carbon to oxygen. Carbons 4 and 5 also have a double bond, represented by &#x27;Δ4,5&#x27;. The reaction involves a stereospecific and permanent break of the Δ4,5 with the help of NADPH as a cofactor. A hydride anion (H−) is also placed on the α face at the fifth carbon, and a proton on the β face at carbon 4.

==Distribution with age==
5α-R1 is expressed in fetal scalp and nongenital skin of the back, anywhere from 5 to 50 times less than in the adult. 5α-R2 is expressed in fetal prostates similar to adults. 5α-R1 is expressed mainly in the epithelium and 5α-R2 the stroma of the fetal prostate. Scientists looked for 5α-R2 expression in fetal liver, adrenal, testis, ovary, brain, scalp, chest, and genital skin, using immunoblotting, and were only able to find it in genital skin.

After birth, the 5α-R1 is expressed in more locations, including the liver, skin, scalp and prostate. 5α-R2 is expressed in prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis, liver, and to a lesser extent the scalp and skin. Hepatic expression of both 5α-R1 and 2 is immediate, but disappears in the skin and scalp at month 18. Then, at puberty, only 5α-R2 is reexpressed in the skin and scalp.

5α-R1 and 5α-R2 appear to be expressed in the prostate in male fetuses and throughout postnatal life. 5α-R1 and 5α-R2 are also expressed, although to different degrees in liver, genital and nongenital skin, prostate, epididymis, seminal vesicle, testis, ovary, uterus, kidney, exocrine pancreas, and the brain.

In adulthood, 5α-R1-3 is ubiquitously expressed.

==Substrates==
Specific substrates include testosterone, progesterone, androstenedione, epitestosterone, cortisol, aldosterone, and deoxycorticosterone. Outside of dihydrotestosterone, much of the physiological role of 5α-reduced steroids is unknown. Beyond reducing testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, 5alpha-reductase enzyme isoforms I and II reduce progesterone to dihydroprogesterone (DHP) and deoxycorticosterone to dihydrodeoxycorticosterone (DHDOC). In vitro and animal models suggest subsequent 3alpha-reduction of DHT, DHP and DHDOC lead to steroid metabolites with effects on cerebral function achieved by enhancing GABAergic inhibition. These neuroactive steroid derivatives enhance GABA via allosteric modulation at GABA(A) receptors and have anticonvulsant, antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, and also alter sexual and alcohol related behavior. 5α-dihydrocortisol is present in the aqueous humor of the eye, is synthesized in the lens, and might help make the aqueous humor itself. Allopregnanolone and THDOC are neurosteroids, with the latter having effects on the susceptibility of animals to seizures. In socially isolated mice, 5α-R1 is specifically down-regulated in glutamatergic pyramidal neurons that converge on the amygdala from cortical and hippocampal regions. This down-regulation may account for the appearance of behavioral disorders such as anxiety, aggression, and cognitive dysfunction. 5α-dihydroaldosterone is a potent antinatriuretic agent, although different from aldosterone. Its formation in the kidney is enhanced by restriction of dietary salt, suggesting it may help retain sodium as follows:
::: &quot;&lt;chem&gt;{Substrate} + {NADPH} + H+ -&gt; {5\alpha-substrate} + NADP+&lt;/chem&gt;&quot;

5α-DHP is a major hormone in circulation of normal cycling and pregnant women.

===Testosterone===
5α-Reductase is most known for converting testosterone, the male sex hormone, into the more potent dihydrotestosterone:
The major difference is the Δ4,5 double-bond on the A (leftmost) ring. The other differences between the diagrams are unrelated to structure.

===List of conversions===
The following reactions are known to be catalyzed by 5α-reductase:
* Cholestenone → 5α-Cholestanone
* Progesterone → 5α-Dihydroprogesterone
* 3α-Dihydroprogesterone → Allopregnanolone
* 3β-Dihydroprogesterone → Isopregnanolone
* Deoxycorticosterone → 5α-Dihydrodeoxycorticosterone
* Corticosterone → 5α-Dihydrocorticosterone
* Aldosterone → 5α-Dihydroaldosterone
* Androstenedione → 5α-Androstanedione
* Testosterone → 5α-Dihydrotestosterone
* Nandrolone → 5α-Dihydronandrolone

== Structure ==
5α-Reductase is a membrane bound enzyme that catalyzes the NADPH dependent reduction of double bonds in steroid substrates to increase potency. The crystal structure of a homolog of 5α-reductase isoenzymes 1 and 2 has been found in &quot;Proteobacteria&quot; (proteobacteria 5α-reductase). This exists as a monomer with a seven alpha-helix transmembrane structure housing a hydrophobic pocket that holds cofactor NADPH and monoolein which occupies the steroid substrate binding pocket. In insect cells monoolein is not found, but is subbed out for other androgens and inhibitors. The integral seven transmembrane topology is likely conserved across species, with the N terminus in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and the C terminus facing the cytosol. High conformational dynamics of the cytosolic region likely regulate NADPH/NADP+ exchange. Sequence conservation across known crystal structures has corroborated high conservation in enzyme structure.

In the 5α-reductase from &quot;Proteobacteria bacterium&quot;, PbSRD5A, NADPH is bound by an extensive hydrogen bonding network, including residues Arg34, which hydrogen bonds to the nicotinamide group, Arg170, which hydrogen bonds to the 2&#x27;-phosphate on the ribose group bound to nicotinamide, Asn192 and His230, which hydrogen bond to the nicotinamide nucleotide phosphate group, Tyr32 and Tyr193, which hydrogen bond to the adenine nucleotide phosphate group, and Asn159, Glu196, and Thr219, which hydrogen bond to the adenine group of NADPH. The steroid-binding pocket contains a motif of Gln, Glu, and Tyr residues, which form a triad of hydrogen-bonds, which coordinate the C3 ketone of steroids into close proximity to the nicotinamide of NADPH, which allows a hydride transfer and Δ4 double-bond reduction. These residues are Gln53, Glu54, and Tyr87 in PbSRD5A.

==Inhibition==

The mechanism of 5α reductase inhibition is complex, but involves the binding of NADPH to the enzyme followed by the substrate. 5α-Reductase inhibitor drugs are used in benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia), and hormone replacement therapy for transgender women.

Inhibition of the enzyme can be classified into two categories: steroidal, which are irreversible, and nonsteroidal. There are more steroidal inhibitors, with examples including finasteride (MK-906), dutasteride (GG745), 4-MA, turosteride, MK-386, MK-434, and MK-963. Researchers have pursued synthesis of nonsteroidals to inhibit 5α-reductase due to the undesired side effects of steroidals. The most potent and selective inhibitors of 5α-R1 are found in this class, and include benzoquinolones, nonsteroidal aryl acids, butanoic acid derivatives, and more recognizably, polyunsaturated fatty acids (especially linolenic acid), zinc, and green tea. Riboflavin was also identified as a 5α-reductase inhibitor .

Additionally, it has been claimed that alfatradiol works through this mechanism of activity (5α-reductase), as well as the Ganoderic acids in lingzhi mushroom, and the Saw Palmetto.

Inhibition of 5α-reductase results in decreased conversion of testosterone to DHT, leading to increased testosterone and estradiol. Other enzymes compensate to a degree for the absent conversion, specifically with local expression at the skin of reductive 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, oxidative 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes.

Gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, impaired cognitive function, fatigue, hypoglycemia, impaired liver function, constipation, and depression, are only a few of the possible side-effects of 5α-reductase inhibition. Long term side effects, that continued even after discontinuation of the drug have been reported.

===Finasteride===
Finasteride inhibits two 5α-reductase isoenzymes (II and III), while dutasteride inhibits all three. Finasteride potently inhibits 5α-R2 at a mean inhibitory concentration IC50 of 69 nM, but is less effective with 5α-R1 with an IC50 of 360 nM. Finasteride decreases mean serum level of DHT by 71% after 6 months, and was shown in vitro to inhibit 5α-R3 at a similar potency to 5α-R2 in transfected cell lines.

===Dutasteride===
Dutasteride inhibits 5α-reductase isoenzymes type 1 and 2 better than finasteride, leading to a more complete reduction in DHT at 24 weeks (94.7% versus 70.8%). It also reduces intraprostatic DHT 97% in men with prostate cancer at 5 mg/day over three months. A second study with 3.5 mg/day for 4 months decreased intraprostatic DHT even further by 99%. The suppression of DHT in vivo, and the report that dutasteride inhibits 5α-R3 in vitro suggest that dutasteride may be a triple 5α reductase inhibitor.

==Congenital deficiencies==
===5α-Reductase 1===
5α-Reductase type 1 inactivated male mice have reduced bone mass and forelimb muscle grip strength, which has been proposed to be due to lack of 5α-reductase type 1 expression in bone and muscle. In 5 alpha reductase type 2 deficient males, the type 1 isoenzyme is thought to be responsible for their virilization at puberty.

===5α-Reductase 2===
Impaired 5α-reductase 2 activity can result from mutations in the underlying SRD5A2 gene. The condition, known as 5α-reductase 2 deficiency, has a range of presentations as atypical appearances of the external genitalia in males. This is because 5α-reductase 2 catalyzes the transformation of testosterone to the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone, which is required for the proper masculinization of male genitalia.

===5α-Reductase 3===
When small interfering RNA is used to knock down the expression of 5α-R3 isozyme in cell lines, there is decreased cell growth, viability, and a decrease in DHT/T ratios. It has also shown the ability to reduce testosterone, androstenedione, and progesterone in androgen stimulated prostate cell lines by adenovirus vectors.

Congenital deficiency of 5α-R3 at the gene SRD53A has been linked to a rare, autosomal recessive condition in which patients are born with severe intellectual dysfunction and cerebellar and ocular defects. The presumed deficiency is reduction of the terminal bond of polyprenol to dolichol, an important step in N-glycosylation of proteins, which in turn is important for proper folding of asparagine residues on nascent protein in the endoplasmic reticulum.

== Nervous system ==

=== Affective disorders ===
Isolation rearing has been shown to lower protein expression of 5α-reductase isoenzymes 1 and 2 in cortical and subcortical brain regions of rat models. However, the amount of 5α-reduced metabolite remained unaffected. This means isolation rearing likely leads to changes in the expression and activity of 5α-reductase in the brain, leading to dysregulation of dopamine neurotransmission, resulting in early chronic stress Treatment with finasteride, a 5α-reductase inhibitor, has been shown to mimic the effects of SSRI&#x27;s causing sexual dysfunction. Research has shown that 5α-reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in neurosteroid synthesis, specifically in the conversion of progesterone to allopregnanolone, low levels of allopregnanolone has been tied to depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. Sleep deprivation can enhance 5α-reductase expression and activity in the prefrontal cortex, leading to mania-related symptoms in rats. It is also contested whether the use of 5α-reductase inhibitors is associated with suicidal ideation and depression in patient populations who use them for benign prostatic hyperplasia. These symptoms have been found during active use of inhibitors and in immediate followup. However, it is unknown if these symptoms arise naturally from benign prostatic hyperplasia.

=== Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysfunction ===
An alternative mechanism of cortisol regulation is regulated via 5α-reductase which catalyzes an A-ring reduction of cortisol, metabolizing the compound. Type 1 and 2 of 5α-reductase are the principal enzymes involved in cortisol clearance through the liver. Excess cortisol has been tied to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease  (MASLD),  but in-vitro studies have found that an over expression of 5α-reductase type 2 can suppress lipogenesis. The key role of 5α-reductase in cortisol breakdown and fat buildup has elucidated some of the side effects of 5α-reductase inhibitors. In randomized studies on human volunteers it was found that 5α-reductase inhibition through the use of dutasteride and finasteride can lead to hepatic lipid accumulation in men. In critical illness, overstimulation of cortisol as part of a stress response can lead to decreased clearance of cortisol through the liver via 5α-reductase and kidneys via 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, longterm elevation of cortisol can lead to Cushing&#x27;s syndrome.

<text>Thumb Wars: The Phantom Cuticle is a 1999 short film directed by Steve Oedekerk. Using dressed up and coifed thumbs as puppets, Oedekerk created a parody of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, with characters like Loke Groundrunner, Princess Bunhead, Oobeedoob Benubi, Hand Duet, Crunchaka, Beeboobeep, Prissypeo, Black Helmet Man and Gabba the Butt. It is the first film in the &quot;Thumbs!&quot; series. &quot;Thumb Wars&quot; debuted on American television May 18, 1999, on UPN. It had its cable premiere on Cartoon Network on October 2, 2008 (and again on October 2, 2009) to promote the 2008 &quot;Clone Wars&quot; series that premiered the next day. The TV version provided a trimmed down version of the film. It was also re-released in 2002 alongside &quot;Thumbtanic&quot; as the &quot;Thumb Wars/Thumbtanic Thumb Double Feature&quot; on VHS and DVD. In 2005, the filmettes were again released together as a UMD Video on the PlayStation Portable system.

The film is produced by O Entertainment and was released on May 18, 1999.

The films stars voice actors Steve Oedekerk, Ross Shafer, Mark DeCarlo, Rob Paulsen, Paul Greenberg, Andrea Fears, and Megan Cavanagh. Steve Oedekerk, Mark DeCarlo, Rob Paulsen, and Megan Cavanagh also worked on the film Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, as well as the TV show that ran from 2002-2006 also done with O Entertainment.

== Storyline ==
The 29-minute film opens with a parody of &quot;Star Wars&quot;&#x27; &quot;A long time ago...&quot; phrase: &quot;If there were thumbs in space and they got mad at each other there would be... THUMB WARS.&quot;

The film then cuts to rolling text flying into the distance, as in &quot;Star Wars&quot;: &quot;It is a time of great unrest in the Universe. Using the nail side of the power of the Thumb, the Evil Thumbpire has taken a stronghold in the Sacul region of the Egroeg sector. The Thumbellion Resistance Fighters have retreated to a hidden base. The Thumbpire is constructing a big dangerous weapon thing with enough fire power to blow stuff up. If the Thumbellion can destroy the big dangerous weapon thing, they will live and the good side of the thumb will reign. If they don&#x27;t there can be no sequels. No sequels means no merchandising, no fan clubs, no freaky guys at conventions that have way too much free time and no clear desire to date girls. Victory is imperative!&quot;

Opening scenes depict Black Helmet Man capturing Princess Bunhead and killing Thumbellion soldiers. On the surface of the planet below, Loke Groundrunner whines to his aunt and uncle about wanting to be of use to someone. His uncle consoles him. &quot;Well you&#x27;re plenty useful here Loke. The harvest is soon and you&#x27;ll be getting help! I bought a couple of digits today from the freaky little hooded creatures. The big one is sort of effeminate and annoying, and I think the little one has an amputee inside!&quot; Loke runs off in a huff and meets up with the man with the silliest name in the galaxy: Oobedoob Scoobi-Doobi Benubi. At Oobedoob&#x27;s place, they view a hologram of Princess Bunhead. She informs them that Black Helmet Man is building a &quot;big, dangerous weapon thing&quot; and that she needs their help. Loke and Oobedoob look up her holographic dress. After they viewed the message, they came back to Loke&#x27;s house to find that his uncle Soondead and aunt Gonnabiteit have been &#x27;clipped&#x27; by Black Helmet Man&#x27;s troops. Loke determines to go and fight this evil menace.

At the Cantina, Loke and Oobedoob meet up with Crunchy and Hand Duet. Hand tells them, &quot;A one armed man killed my wife Sabrina, a working girl. Now I&#x27;m a fugitive and in clear and present danger. I should be presumed innocent but they&#x27;re playing patriot games with me. Raiders. Regarding Henry. Blade Runner. Air Force One...&quot;

Loke and Oobedoob pay Hand and Crunchy in &quot;girly giggles&quot; at Hand&#x27;s request, to save his skin from Gabba the Butt. The group boards Hand&#x27;s ship &quot;Hand&#x27;s Hand&quot; and set off to save Princess Bunhead and the galaxy. They are caught in a tractor beam outside of the Thumb Star which can spin planets. Once on the space station, Oobedoob and Black Helmet Man engage in a final duel, which Oobedoob is tricked into losing. Princess Bunhead appears and says, &quot;I escaped somehow. Let&#x27;s go.&quot; The team, minus Oobedoob, flee. However, Oobedoob&#x27;s voice can be heard in Loke&#x27;s head saying that he is still there &quot;in spirit.&quot; Loke mentions that he considers this to be &quot;kinda creepy&quot;.

The group hides in an asteroid where Loke meets Master Puppet. Master Puppet agrees to train Loke in the ways of The Thumb. After a training session, which Loke ends up failing miserably, Master Puppet (deeply humored by Loke&#x27;s bumbling) dubs him a Thumb Master.

The group travels to the Thumbellion base to regroup for the final attack on the Thumb Star. They learn that there is a button on the station designed to blow the entire thing up, much to the confusion of Princess Bunhead. The Thumbellion fleet launches an attack on the station. This sets the stage for the final confrontation between Loke Groundrunner and Black Helmet Man atop Loke&#x27;s Finger-wing fighter. It is then that Black Helmet Man reveals: &quot;Loke, I am your... mother!&quot; and throws his cape back to reveal a pink dress. &quot;Hand&#x27;s Hand&quot; appears and knocks Black Helmet Man off into space. As he floats into space, Black Helmet Man calls out to Loke by yelling, &quot;Just wait till your father gets home!&quot;

When Loke proudly proclaims that he will use the Power of the Thumb to hit the destruct button, Oobedoob&#x27;s voice is heard saying to use the ship&#x27;s targeting system, as &quot;that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s there for.&quot; Loke fires a missile which hits the button and the giant thumb is destroyed.

The last scene shows the cast at a Chili Cookoff, along with Master Puppet (visibly controlled by a puppeteer) and the ghost of Oobedoob. The film ends with a voiceover from Oobedoob: &quot;The Thumb will be with you...always.&quot;

== Production ==
The production for &quot;Thumb Wars&quot; started in 1997 with Steve Oedekerk, Paul Marshal, Tom Koranda, Mark DeCarlo and Jim Jackman. In 1998, the production for &quot;Thumb Wars&quot; developed more seriously into filming. The production started filming in Los Angeles, California in the California suburbs.

== Running gags ==
Throughout the movie different characters will ask Loke to touch tongues. First to do so is Oobedoob, requiring the act to &quot;seal the training&#x27;s beginning&quot; and &quot;make it all official&quot;, followed by Master Puppet asking for the same in order to train Loke in the ways of the Thumb.

As a running gag between all of the Thumbs! featurettes, a one-eyed thumb appears in each one; in &quot;Thumb Wars&quot;, the one-eyed thumb is the bartender at the cantina.

== Releases ==
&quot;Thumb Wars&quot; was first released on VHS, and then again with additional features, including character bios, commentary, and a &#x27;Gabba the Butt&#x27; interview, on DVD.

It is also available as part of the &quot;Thumb Wars/Thumbtanic Double Feature&quot; on DVD and UMD for the PlayStation Portable, released by O Entertainment and Image Entertainment. This disc features the two Thumbation filmettes &quot;Thumbtanic&quot; and &quot;Thumb Wars&quot; in that order. It also includes wraparound footage of The Thumbersons. Despite including the cast interviews from &quot;Thumbtanic&quot; and the Gabba the Butt interview and Character Bios from &quot;Thumb Wars&quot;, the film lacks the commentary available on the single-film releases.

<text>General Sir Richard Nelson &quot;Windy&quot; Gale, (25 June 1896 – 29 July 1982) was a senior officer in the British Army who served in both world wars. In the First World War he was awarded the Military Cross in 1918 whilst serving as a junior officer in the Machine Gun Corps. During the Second World War he served with 1st Parachute Brigade and then the 6th Airborne Division during the D-Day landings and Operation Tonga in 1944. After the end of the conflict, Gale remained in the army and eventually, in 1958, succeeded Field Marshal The Viscount Montgomery as Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe.

==Early life==
Gale was born on 25 June 1896 in London, England, to Wilfred Gale, a merchant from Hull, and his wife Helen Webber Ann, daughter of Joseph Nelson, of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. The early years of his life were spent in Australia and New Zealand due to his father&#x27;s gaining employment in insurance, but the Gale family returned to England in 1906. He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, Northwood, a foundation school in the City of London, gaining an average academic record but becoming a prolific reader. After this, he attended further education at Aldenham School in Hertfordshire. For a time, he was a boarder at King Edward VI School, Stratford-upon-Avon.

When Gale left Aldenham he wanted to become a British Army officer in the Royal Artillery, but did not possess the academic qualifications or physical grades required for entry into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Instead Gale followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and gained employment as an insurance agent, but he rapidly grew to dislike the job; determined to enter the British Army, he attended regular physical training classes and studied hard to improve his academic grades.

==First World War==
When the First World War broke out in August 1914, Gale, only recently turned 18, was still below the medical standards required for a recruit and failed to join a Territorial Force unit in London. He finally gained entry to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in the summer of 1915 and was commissioned into the Worcestershire Regiment, &quot;the regiment of my choice&quot;, as a second lieutenant on 22 December.
 When Gale joined the regiment, he put his name forward for a course on training with machine guns and was accepted, being transferred to the Machine Gun Training Centre at Grantham, Lincolnshire.

Appointed to the MGC on 13 March 1916, in short order he was posted to the Western Front.

Gale was posted, in the summer of 1916, to the 164th Machine Gun Company, which was in support of the 164th (North Lancashire) Brigade of the 55th (West Lancashire) Division, a first-line formation of the Territorial Force (TF). With his company, he fought in the Battle of the Somme and, towards the end of the year, served in the Ypres Salient. He was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on 1 November 1916, and to the substantive rank on 1 July 1917. He was next involved in the Capture of Wytschaete in June 1917 but was not involved in the Passchendaele offensive, as he was suffering from both mental and physical exhaustion, and was sent to England on leave, and diagnosed with pyorrhoea. He returned to service in January 1918, although now serving with the 126th Machine Gun Company of the 126th (East Lancashire) Brigade, part of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. Among the fellow officers in his new company was Major Edwin Flavell, who was to serve in Gales&#x27; later career. On 23 February the company merged into the 42nd Battalion, MGC. It was during his service as a subaltern in France that he won the Military Cross (MC). During the German spring offensive launched by the German Army in mid-March 1918, Gale was awarded his MC for &#x27;conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty&#x27;. The citation for the MC reads:

Soon promoted to captain, Gale continued to serve on the Western Front, taking part in the Hundred Days Offensive, until the end of the war on 11 November 1918.

==Between the wars==
When the war ended in November 1918, Gale volunteered to go to India in 1919, serving with the 12th Battalion, MGC where Captain John Harding was a fellow subaltern who, like Gale, was to attain the highest ranks in the army. However, in 1922 the MGC was disbanded and Gale reverted to serving with the Worcestershire Regiment, and served with the 3rd Battalion, Worcesters before that, too, was disbanded, with Gale transferring to the Machine Gun School in India. In 1924, he married Ethel Maude Larnack Keene. In 1928 he joined the 1st Battalion, Worcesters. During his time in India he gained entry to the Staff College at Quetta, attending from 1930 to 1931, and after two years in the institution he graduated as a staff officer. Promotion prospects during the interwar years were limited, and although he received above average grades in his annual reports, he remained a subaltern for fifteen years, until he was promoted to the rank of captain in the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry (DCLI) on 26 February 1930.

In February 1932, Gale was seconded for service as a General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) in India. He was appointed a brigade major on 1 January 1934. Gale left India in January 1936 and returned to England to serve with the DCLI, receiving a brevet promotion to major on 1 July. In February 1937 he was transferred to the War Office as a GSO2, with responsibilities for the creation of training pamphlets and publications. He transferred to the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers on 13 October. In December 1938 he was promoted to major and moved to the Staff Duties (Planning) section of the General Staff at the War Office.

==Second World War==
===1939−1942===
By December 1940 Gale, who had not seen service with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France and Belgium, had been promoted to the acting rank of lieutenant-colonel and, wishing for a field command, was given command of the 2/5th Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment, a second-line Territorial Army (TA) unit that was part of Brigadier Gerard Bucknall&#x27;s 138th Infantry Brigade, itself part of the 46th Infantry Division, then commanded by Major-General Charles Hudson, which had fought with the BEF. The battalion, along with the rest of the division, was serving in Scotland, reforming after having sustained very severe casualties in France, before moving to East Anglia in January 1941. Then, in the summer of 1941, the 1st Parachute Brigade was formed as part of the expansion of the British Army&#x27;s newly created airborne forces, and Gale was offered command of the brigade by General Sir Alan Brooke, the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces (and soon to be Chief of the Imperial General Staff/CIGS), who was impressed with the high morale and standards in Gale&#x27;s battalion; he accepted the command. In late October the 1st Airlanding Brigade, under Brigadier George Hopkinson, along with the 1st Parachute Brigade, under Gale, were assigned to the newly created 1st Airborne Division, whose first General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major-General Frederick &quot;Boy&quot; Browning.

February 1942 saw Operation Biting, perhaps better known as the Bruneval Raid, take place, in which Major John Frost&#x27;s &#x27;C&#x27; Company of the 2nd Parachute Battalion, of Gales&#x27; 1st Para Brigade, was selected to participate. The raid, &quot;a model of a combined operation on a minor scale&quot;, in Gale&#x27;s own words was very successful, with the objective – to seize equipment from a German radar station in France – being achieved, although there were casualties. Frost would later command the battalion, most notably in the Battle of Arnhem as part of Operation Market Garden in September 1944.

The next few months were spent organizing the brigade, choosing officers and devising new training schemes. He later described the methods he used in his brigade:
The parachute soldier has characteristics that mark him out among men. First, he is a volunteer and, second, he has to overcome something every time he jumps. Few men will willingly hurl themselves out of an aeroplane, and when doing so they inevitably have to fight fear. Perhaps some may get callous to this, but I think that for the majority it always holds true. When a parachute soldier lands he knows that his future chances of survival rest on his personal skill. His weapon and the comparatively small amount of ammunition he can carry are all he has. He is, for some time at least, away from artillery or tank support; he may be dropped wide and find himself alone and he may be injured; but it is his battle and he knows it. When he jumps the parachute soldier gains something that he never loses.

This splendid material deserved the best officers. In forming my brigade I was fortunate in having the privilege of selecting all company commanders, the commanding officers selecting the remainder. There was no shortage of volunteers. I took as my yardstick their potential as leaders. Though leadership springs from a number of qualities, sometimes not discernible until the supreme test, there is one quality I felt to be essential; this was initiative.

Of all the characteristics the airborne soldier would expect and look for in his officers initiative is probably the most important. I tried this test by putting it in the form of a question of what an individual would do in certain circumstances, and this I tried out later when training my division. Suppose a subaltern had just landed and hears the approach of what he thinks is an enemy tank, what would he do? The answer so often was that he would get on the blower and tell his company commander; to the question what would he have done had he been a company commander in similar circumstances came a similar answer. This tendency to hang decisions on the next superior should have no place in the mental attitude of an airborne officer, for in nine cases out of ten he might never make the contact; but, even if he did, it was action that was wanted and this was where initiative came in.
Then in April 1942 Gale, by now a war-substantive lieutenant-colonel, was ordered to hand over his brigade to Edwin Flavell, formerly his company commander in France over twenty years before, and, much to his displeasure, posted back to the War Office as Deputy Director of Staff Duties (DDSD), and subsequently promoted to Director of Air. Gale&#x27;s remit as Director of Air was to attempt to formulate a clear policy about the use of airborne forces between the army and the Royal Air Force (RAF), as well as to solve the aircraft shortages that stymied many attempts to conduct further airborne operations. There was a great deal of rivalry between the two services, with the RAF sure that large-scale bombing would win the conflict, and therefore unwilling to transfer any aircraft to the army for use by airborne forces.

===1943−1944===
In May 1943, Gale was promoted to the acting rank of major-general and became GOC of the newly formed 6th Airborne Division. Gale had just under a year to organize and train the division before it was due to participate in Operation Tonga, codename for the British airborne landings in Normandy, in June 1944. The division was initially understrength due to trained British airborne troops being transferred to North Africa and Sicily to replace the very heavy losses suffered by the 1st Airborne Division (now commanded by Hopkinson who had succeeded Browning) during its operations, but it was soon expanded with the arrival of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, joining the 3rd Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier James Hill, as well as the formation of the 5th Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Nigel Poett, and the 6th Airlanding Brigade, under Brigadier Hugh Kindersley. No British airborne division had ever been deployed into battle entirely through aerial means, and devising plans and formulating tactics for the operation placed a great deal of pressure on Gale.

However, Gale&#x27;s thoroughness paid off when the division successfully landed in Normandy in June 1944. For his part in planning and taking part in Operation Tonga, Gale was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 29 August 1944; in May, he had been promoted to colonel (war-substantive), and also to the temporary rank of major-general. The plan for the Allied invasion of Normandy was for five Allied divisions (two US, two British and one Canadian) to land on designated beaches between Varreville in the west, on the Cotentin Peninsula, and Ouistreham, by the mouth of the river Orne, in the east. Airborne troops were to secure each flank of the beachhead, with the US 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions landing on the western flank, and the British 6th Airborne Division, under Gale, on the eastern flank. The 6th Airborne Division was to capture a number of bridges over the river Orne and the Caen Canal and hold the nearby surrounding areas, to destroy the bridges over the river Dives, and, finally, to destroy the Merville Gun Battery by the coast.

Shortly after midnight on 6 June 1944, known otherwise as D-Day, men of Major John Howard&#x27;s &#x27;D&#x27; Company of the 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (2 OBLI), a glider infantry unit forming part of the 6th Airlanding Brigade, landed in glider and captured the Caen canal and Orne river bridges (now known as Pegasus Bridge and Horsa Bridge) via coup de main. It was achieved with light casualties. The two parachute brigades, the 3rd and 5th, landed soon after and landed, for the most part, where intended, although numbers of paratroopers dropped in the flooded countryside. The Merville Gun Battery also fell, although with heavy losses to Lieutenant-Colonel Jock Pearson&#x27;s 8th Parachute Battalion. At dawn, Gale himself landed in Normandy by a glider piloted by Billy Griffith. By midday on D-Day elements of Brigadier Lord Lovat&#x27;s 1st Special Service Brigade had landed at Sword Beach, with the British 3rd Infantry Division following, and began to relieve the airborne troops at the bridges. The arrival of the rest of the 6th Airlanding Brigade in the evening, in Operation Mallard, completed the 6th Airborne Division&#x27;s concentration in Normandy.

The next week saw the 6th Airborne Division, serving as part of Lieutenant-General John Crocker&#x27;s I Corps, engaged in almost constant fighting, notably at Bréville, in an attempt to prevent the Germans from driving the Allies back into the sea. After mid-June, when German counterattacks ceased, the division, reinforced by the 1st and 4th Special Service Brigades, spent the next two months in a static defence role, holding a nine thousand yard front southwards from the sea.

In mid-August, with the situation in Normandy turning against the Germans and forcing them to withdraw to Falaise, the division was ordered to go over to the offensive and pursued to the Germans to the Seine, advancing some 45 miles in nine days, capturing 400 square miles of enemy territory and capturing over 1,000 of the enemy. All this was achieved despite the belief of Crocker, the corps commander, and Gale himself, that the division was poorly equipped for a rapid pursuit.

===1944−1945===
On 5 September the division was taken out of the front lines, after almost exactly three months since landing in Normandy, and returned to the United Kingdom for rest and recuperation, after sustaining almost 4,500 casualties. Soon after returning to England the 6th Airborne Division&#x27;s sister formation, the 1st Airborne Division, then under Major-General Roy Urquhart, took part in the hugely ambitious Operation Market Garden, which Gale believed was doomed to failure from the start.

In December Gale handed over command of the division to Major-General Eric Bols, formerly an infantry brigade commander, who was soon to lead the division in a ground role in the Battle of the Bulge. Gale was then appointed to the headquarters of the First Allied Airborne Army (FAAAA), becoming deputy to the American commander, Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton. Planning then began for Operation Varsity, the airborne landings in support of Operation Plunder, the Allied crossing of the river Rhine. The operation was carried out in late March 1945 by the US XVIII Airborne Corps, under Major General Matthew Ridgway, with the British 6th and US 17th Airborne Divisions participating. Despite the operation&#x27;s success, with Gale calling it &quot;the most successful of all airborne operations&quot;, both divisions suffered very heavy casualties and the need for the entire operation was questionable, both at the time and later.

In the last months of the war in Europe, Gale was given command of I Airborne Corps. He was promoted to the permanent rank of major-general on 7 January 1945, with the acting rank of lieutenant-general from 24 May. In July, after Victory in Europe Day (VE-Day), Gale, with the corps HQ, was sent to India, where the Japanese were still fighting. In India Gale took elements of his old 6th Airborne Division, still led by Bols, under command, along with the 44th Indian Airborne Division, and planning began for airborne operations in the Far East, in particular the recapturing of Bangkok, although the surrender of Japan cancelled these plans and, after almost six years, the war finally came to an end.

==Later life==
On 4 December 1946, Gale was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-general. In January 1946, shortly after I Airborne Corps was disbanded, Gale became GOC of the 1st Infantry Division, succeeding Major-General Charles Loewen, then stationed in Egypt before, in March, being sent to Palestine, where there were tensions between the Jews and the Arabs, and commanded the division throughout the Palestine Emergency. Gales&#x27; division, serving under British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan, commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Evelyn Barker (later replaced by Lieutenant-General Sir Gordon MacMillan), was responsible for northern Palestine, with his old 6th Airborne Division, now commanded by Major-General James Cassels, responsible for southern Palestine. Gale relinquished command of the division to Major-General Horatius Murray in December 1947 and, in January 1948, he was appointed GOC British Troops in Egypt, succeeding Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Allfrey. Then in 1949, after handing over the command to Lieutenant-General George Erskine, he was transferred and became Director-General of Military Training. Gale was promoted to general on 6 June 1952, eight years after he landed in Normandy, and appointed Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C), Northern Army Group, Allied Land Forces Europe and British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), succeeding General Sir John Harding, on 24 September; he held the post until retiring in 1957, in turn handing over BAOR to General Sir Dudley Ward. His wife Ethel having died in 1952, on 7 April, 1953, Gale married secondly Daphne Mabelle Eveline, daughter of Francis Blick, of Stroud, Gloucestershire.

Gale initially retired in 1957, but in September 1958 he was recalled to serve with NATO and replaced Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery as Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Europe; he retired permanently in September 1960 after two years in the post and was replaced by General Sir Hugh Stockwell. During the post-war years, Gale also held a number of ceremonial and non-military posts; he was aide-de-camp (general) to the Queen Elizabeth II between 1954 and 1957, Colonel of the Worcestershire Regiment between 1950 and 1961, and Colonel-Commandant of the Parachute Regiment between 1956 and 1967.

Gale died at his home in Kingston upon Thames on 29 July 1982, just four days after his 86th birthday. His widow, Daphne, subsequently lived in a grace and favour apartment in Hampton Court Palace; she died during a major fire at the palace in March 1986, caused by the lighted candle she used in her bedroom at night whilst having a drink, as was her habit. The fire necessitated an extensive restoration programme which was completed in 1990.

==Military thinking==
Gale&#x27;s approach to military affairs emerged from both his personal history and personality. Gale, a &#x27;tall, bluff, ruddy&#x27; individual, with a reputation as &#x27;a bit of a buccaneer&#x27; but allegedly possessing a &#x27;hectoring manner and a loud voice&#x27;, was one of a number of First World War veterans to challenge the military status quo that had led to the terrible losses on the Western Front. Events such as the losses in the Battle of the Somme in 1916 heavily influenced Gale&#x27;s thinking, and he emerged from the war with a suspicion of predominantly firepower-led operations. Looking back, Gale was to remember the &#x27;wonderful panorama&#x27; of the infantry successfully advancing using modern infiltration tactics on a clear day in the spring of 1918, contributing to his embracing the interwar manoeuvrist theorists during his time at the Staff College, Quetta in the early 1930s. Gale saw a narrative in the sequence of developments from the creation of the new infantry tactics of 1918, through to the tanks and airborne forces of the 1940s, that demonstrated the &#x27;fundamental necessity of mobility on the battlefield&#x27;, and the importance of surprise at all levels of warfare.

During the Second World War, Gale applied these principles to the development of airborne forces. An advocate of shock manoeuvre with elite forces, Gale stressed extensive training, the use of the latest battlefield technologies and strong personal leadership. For Gale, the quality of one&#x27;s military forces were as important as their number, and he drew additional lessons on the disproportionate effect that surprise manoeuvre had on a &quot;demoralised or unprepared enemy&quot;, as opposed to a &#x27;well-trained opposition&#x27;, from the operations of his own 6th Airborne Division in Normandy. Later in life, Gale examined the issues of war in the nuclear age. Still an advocate of manoeuvre and high-quality forces, Gale was to stress the importance of achieving mobility and flexibility in the face of the Soviet threat, foreshadowing in many ways the evolution of the AirLand battle doctrine of the 1980s.

<text>Sadi Moma (&quot;A Girl Plants&quot;) is a Bulgarian folk song. The song, like many Bulgarian and other traditional Eastern European folk songs, is in an uneven meter: 7/8, counted as slow-quick-quick (SQQ).

There is a Bulgarian folk dance traditionally associated with the song Sadi Moma and often called by the same name. It is danced in one or more open circles of dancers, whose arms are joined in W-position.

Its melody was borrowed by Richard Stallman for the tune of the Free Software Song.

Translation in English:
:A girl planted a vine, a white wine grape vine.
:For one day she planted, for two she regretted
:the white wine grape vine.
:The vine grew up, the white wine grape vine.
:It filled nine barrels with wine,
:The tenth with clear, strong rakija.
:A young soldier learned to drink.
:He drank for two days, he drank for three days, for a week.
:He drank up his black horse from under him.

<doc id="1245414" wikidata="Q1031946" url="?curid=1245414" title="Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope">
<text>The Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) is located near the summit of Mauna Kea mountain on Hawaii&#x27;s Big Island at an altitude of 4,204 meters (13,793 feet), part of the Mauna Kea Observatory. Operational since 1979, the telescope is a Prime Focus/Cassegrain configuration with a usable aperture diameter of .

CFHT is currently considering a refurbishment to the facility in the 2020s. The facility would be reconstructed with a new 11-m telescope to produce the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer, retaining the same base building and infrastructure. First light is expected no earlier than 2029.

==Funding==
The corporation is bound by a tripartite agreement between the University of Hawaii at Manoa, in the United States, the National Research Council (NRC) in Canada and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in France. CFHT also has partnerships with the National Astronomical Observatory of China (NAOC), the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) in Taiwan, the National Laboratory of Astrophysics (LNA) in Brazil and the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) in Korea. The contributions from these associate partners help fund CFHT&#x27;s future instrumentation. Currently, CFHT observing time is offered to scientists from all the seven countries in the partnership. Astronomers from the European Union can also submit proposals through the Optical Infrared Coordination Network for Astronomy (OPTICON) access program.

==Instruments==
CFHT currently operates five instruments:

* MegaPrime/MegaCam, a one square degree field high-resolution CCD mosaic of 40 CCDs totalling 378 megapixels
* WIRCam (Wide-Field Infrared Camera), an infrared mosaic of 4 detectors totalling 16 megapixels, optimized for the J, H, and K spectral bands
* ESPaDOnS (Echelle SpectroPolarimetric Device for the Observation of Stars at CFHT), an echelle spectrograph/spectropolarimeter
* SITELLE (Spectromètre Imageur à Transformée de Fourier pour l&#x27;Etude en Long et en Large de raies d&#x27;Emission), a wide-field Fourier transform spectrograph
* SPIRou (Spectropolarimètre Infrarouge), a near-infrared spectropolarimeter

==Outreach==
CFHT, in collaboration with Coelum Astronomia, maintains a public-outreach website called &quot;Hawaiian Starlight&quot; which offers extremely high-quality versions of CFHT images in various formats including a yearly calendar.

<doc id="1245415" wikidata="Q3976133" url="?curid=1245415" title="Stroud Green">
<text>Stroud Green is a suburb and electoral ward in north London, England, split between the London boroughs of Haringey and Islington. On its south-western side, Stroud Green Road forms part of the boundary between the two boroughs.

Stroud Green Road is the main local hub and shopping area. At its eastern end it intersects Seven Sisters Road and Blackstock Road at a major crossroads. Stroud Green Road is a populous thoroughfare linking Crouch Hill with the major north London transport interchange of Finsbury Park station.

== History ==
=== Toponymy ===
In 1407, the area was called &quot;Strode&quot;, which is formed from the Old English &#x27;stōd&#x27; and means &#x27;marshy ground covered with brushwood&#x27;. It is recorded as &quot;Stowde Grene&quot; in 1546, the &#x27;grene&#x27; suffix is Middle English and means &#x27;village green&#x27;.

== Locale ==
=== Stroud Green Road ===
The neighbourhood high street, Stroud Green Road, includes a wide range of restaurants and other mainly independent shops. There are also two high-street supermarkets.

The Finsbury Park end of the road, though different in character to the stretch further north, is currently benefitting from a large regeneration scheme centred on Finsbury Park town centre.

The folk record label Topic Records was based at 48–50 Stroud Green Road and many folk LPs were recorded there. The label has since moved to Uppingham in Rutland.

=== Library ===
In the east of the neighbourhood, next to Harringay railway station is the Stroud Green &amp; Harringay Library.

== Transport ==
Stroud Green Road runs north west from the transport hub of Finsbury Park station, and stops just 150 yards south east of Crouch Hill railway station on the Gospel Oak to Barking line. On the eastern border of Stroud Green is Harringay railway station on the Great Northern Line. London bus routes W3, W7, 310 and 210 run the length of Stroud Green Road, terminating at Finsbury Park. The low railway bridge at Finsbury Park prevents bus routes running directly from areas north of Finsbury Park such as Stroud Green Road directly into central London.

Stroud Green railway station closed in 1954. It was on the Finsbury Park to Edgware line, and along with nearby Crouch End railway station had been planned to be added to the Northern line of London Underground, but World War II intervened.

<text>Tom Knight is an American synthetic biologist and computer engineer, who was formerly a senior research scientist at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, a part of the MIT School of Engineering. He now works at the synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks, which he cofounded in 2008.

== Career ==

=== Work in electrical engineering and computer science ===
Tom Knight arrived at MIT when he was fourteen. Even though he only started his undergraduate studies at the regular age of 18, he took classes in computer programming and organic chemistry during high school because he lived close to the university. He built early hardware such as ARPANET interfaces for host #6 on the network, some of the first bitmapped displays, the ITS time sharing system, Lisp machines (he was also instrumental in releasing a version of the operating system for the Lisp machine under a BSD license), the Connection Machine, and parallel symbolic processing computer systems.

In 1967 Knight wrote the original kernel for the ITS operating system, as well as the combination of command processor and debugger that was used as its top-level user interface. ITS was the dominant operating system for first Project MAC and later the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and MIT Laboratory for Computer Science. ITS ran on PDP-6 and, later, PDP-10 computers.

In 1968, Knight designed and supervised the construction of the first PDP-10 ARPANET interfaces with Bob Metcalfe.

Knight developed a system to use standard television sets as a terminal interface to the PDP-10.

In 1972, Knight designed one of the first semiconductor memory-based bitmap displays. This was later commercialized and led directly to the development of the Bedford Computer Systems newspaper layout system and influenced many of the bitmapped display devices available today. That same year, along with Jeff Rubin, Knight designed and implemented a network file system that provided the first transparent remote file access over the ARPANET.

In 1974, Knight designed and implemented the prototype version of the MIT Lisp Machine processor, with the production version following in 1976. The Lisp Machine was a microprogrammed machine, tuned for high-performance emulation of other instruction sets. The design of the Lisp Machine was directly implemented by both Symbolics and LMI and was the basis of all of their computers. Texas Instruments implemented surface mount and single-chip versions of the architecture in 1983 and 1987, respectively.

Knight collaborated with Jack Holloway in designing and implementing the Chaosnet, a re-engineered version of the Xerox 3 Mbit/s Ethernet. In 1975 this network became the first local area network on MIT&#x27;s campus. Chaosnet&#x27;s innovation of a preamble bit string for packets was eventually incorporated into the 10 Mbit/s Ethernet standard.

In 1980, Knight participated in the development of the Connection Machine architecture and its original implementation. Other notable and diverse accomplishments during the 1980s included the creation of the first silicon retina in 1981, the creation of a single-chip optical mouse, the design of the Cross-Omega interconnection network architecture, and the design of the Transit multiprocessor interconnection architecture.

During the early 1990s, Knight was involved in the formation of Permabit and of Exa Corporation and the architecture of the latter&#x27;s initial version of its FX/1 lattice gas parallel fluid flow computer. Advances included using over-relaxation techniques to make 10x algorithmic improvements in lattice gas computations, landmark CFD accuracies, and correction of misconceptions about the origin of fluid turbulence in simple two-dimensional flow situations. Within the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, he led the Abacus SIMD project, worked on VLSI micro displays, and made advances in the field of adiabatic (reversible) computing.

=== Work in synthetic biology ===
It was also during this period that Knight&#x27;s interests in biological systems began. Inspired in part by the work of Harold J. Morowitz, a Yale physicist and biologist, Knight studied biochemistry, genetics, and cellular biology, and set up a biology lab within the MIT AI Laboratory. In this lab he created the concept of the BioBrick plasmid DNA part and began creating a library of BioBricks that could be used to simplify the genetic engineering of Escherichia coli cells. Today, BioBricks form the basis of the enormous annual iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) competition and Knight is sometimes referred to as the godfather of synthetic biology. Knight co-founded Ginkgo Bioworks, a synthetic biology company. Ginkgo Bioworks went public in 2021.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-125 was an unrealized project to develop a new long-range supersonic bomber for the Soviet Air Force. Development commenced in 1958 to replace the newest Tu-22. The &quot;Tu-125&quot; designation was an internal one used by the Tupolev design bureau. Since the aircraft was never built, it never received a military designation.

A canard design was chosen for the aircraft, featuring a delta planform for the wing and stabilizer. Two turbojets (Kuznetsov NK-6 or NK-10 (230–240 kN)) were to be installed in nacelles under the wings. A four-turbojet version, powered by Tumansky R-15B-300s in two nacelles also was considered. The fuselage and wings made from titanium and aluminium alloys.

In September 1962, the Soviet Air Force rejected the project and it was stopped. No aircraft were built.

<text>Horace Pippin (February 22, 1888 – July 6, 1946) was an American painter who painted a range of themes, including scenes inspired by his service in World War I, landscapes, portraits, and biblical subjects. Some of his best-known works address the U.S.&#x27;s history of slavery and racial segregation. He was the first Black artist to be the subject of a monograph, Selden Rodman&#x27;s &quot;Horace Pippin, A Negro Painter in America&quot; (1947), and &quot;The New York Times&quot; eulogized him as the &quot;&quot;most&quot; important Negro painter&quot; in American history. He is buried at Chestnut Grove Cemetery Annex in West Goshen Township, Pennsylvania. A Pennsylvania State historical Marker at 327 Gay Street, West Chester, Pennsylvania, identifies his home at the time of his death and commemorates his accomplishments.

==Early life==
Pippin was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania, on February 22, 1888, to Harriet Pippin; his father&#x27;s identity is unknown. He grew up in and around Goshen, New York, but would return to West Chester in adulthood. In Goshen, he attended segregated schools until he was 15, when he went to work to support his ailing mother. As a boy, Horace responded to an art supply company&#x27;s advertising contest and won his first set of crayons and a box of watercolors. He apparently liked to draw the racehorses and jockeys from Goshen&#x27;s celebrated, trotter (horse) racetrack. He was a member of church congregations, including St. John&#x27;s African Union Methodist Protestant Church. Before he enlisted to serve in World War I, he worked in a coal yard in Goshen, as a hotel porter at the St. Elmo Hotel in Goshen, as a mover at a storage warehouse in Paterson, New Jersey, and as an iron moulder in Mahwah, New Jersey. 

==World War I==
In World War I, Pippin served in K Company, the 3rd Battalion of the 369th infantry regiment, known for their bravery in battle as the famous Harlem Hellfighters. The predominately Black unit faced a segregated US Army, especially before they were transferred to the command of the French Army. They were the longest serving U.S. regiment on the war&#x27;s frontlines, holding their ground against enemy fire almost continuously from early April until the end of the war. The regiment as a whole was awarded the French Croix de Guerre.

In September 1918, Pippin was shot by a German sniper, probably during the capture of Séchault, which was part of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. As he later explained: 
Initially, the injury cost him the use of his arm and earned him a disability pension for life. While he eventually recovered much of his arm&#x27;s function, he remained unable &quot;to lift my right hand above my head without the aid of my left hand.&quot; (Presumably, mischaracterizations of that quote and a photo shoot from December 1940, illustrated above, are the sources of the erroneous, widespread idea that he had to move his right hand with his left to paint.)

He was honorably discharged in 1919. He was retroactively awarded a Purple Heart for his combat injury in 1945. He said of his combat experience:

After the war, Pippin created four memoirs—one illustrated—that describe his harrowing military service in detail. He returned to war subjects periodically throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and later said that WWI &quot;brought out all the art in me&quot;.

==Postwar life and art career==
Immediately after the war, Pippin moved to Bellville, New Jersey, with his brother and worked as a truck driver. The following year, 1920, he married Jennie Fetherstone Wade Giles, who had been widowed twice and had a six-year-old-son, Richard Wade. Pippin moved to his wife&#x27;s home in West Chester, Pennsylvania, where city directories from the mid-1920s list him as a laborer. The 1930 census lists him as a junk dealer, and he also reportedly made deliveries for his wife&#x27;s laundry business. 
Pippin took up art in the 1920s and began painting on stretched fabric in 1930 with &quot;The Ending of the War: Starting Home&quot;. While he later explained his creative process: &quot;The pictures which I have already painted come to me in my mind, and if to me it is a worth while picture, I paint it,&quot; he revised his compositions extensively. He addressed a range of themes, from landscapes and still lifes to biblical subjects and political statements. Some draw on his personal experience of the war or turn-of-the-century domestic life.

He was &quot;discovered&quot; when he submitted two paintings to a local art show—the Chester County Art Association (CCAA) Annual Exhibition—reportedly with the aid and encouragement of various locals, including CCAA co-founders art critic Christian Brinton and artist N.C. Wyeth. Brinton immediately organized a solo exhibition, cosponsored by the CCAA and the interracial West Chester Community Center, and then connected him with MoMA curators Dorothy Miller and Holger Cahill and, by 1940, the Philadelphia art dealer Robert Carlen and collector Albert C. Barnes. Pippin attended art appreciation classes at the Barnes Foundation in the spring 1940 semester. Carlen, Barnes, and, starting in 1941, dealer Edith Gregor Halpert played prominent roles in Pippin&#x27;s career.

In the eight years between his national debut in the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s traveling exhibition &quot;Masters of Popular Painting&quot; (1938) and his death at the age of fifty-eight, Pippin&#x27;s recognition grew exponentially across the country and internationally. During this period, he had solo exhibitions in commercial galleries in Philadelphia (1940, 1941) and New York (1940, 1944), and at the Arts Club of Chicago (1941) and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1942). Private collections and institutions such as the Barnes Foundation, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art acquired his works. His paintings were featured in annual or biennials at the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, as well as thematic surveys at the Dayton Art Institute, Ohio; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Newark Museum, Newark, New Jersey; and Tate Gallery, London, UK.

In the catalogue for one of his memorial exhibitions in 1947, critic Alain Locke described Pippin as &quot;a real and rare genius, combining folk quality with artistic maturity so uniquely as almost to defy classification.&quot;

==Artworks==
Pippin&#x27;s oeuvre includes a variety of subjects and compositional strategies. He began in the 1920s by burning designs into wood panels—mostly snow scenes—and adding paint in one or two colors to highlight specific components of the image.

His first oil painting, &quot;The Ending of the War, Starting Home&quot; (1930–1933), depicts a scene informed by his experience at the Battle of Sechault, where he was shot. (It does not depict the official German surrender on November 11, 1918, which happened as he was recovering in a French hospital.) He also made the frame and decorated it with hand-carved war materiel, including German and French helmets and weapons. He painted World War I several times thereafter in the 1930s and once more in 1945. 

Pippin painted several religious subjects, which align with his roles as a Sunday school teacher and member of a church choir in West Chester. Many, including his celebrated Holy Mountain series, depict Bible verses. The three paintings of his &quot;Holy Mountain&quot; series are reminiscent of the bucolic &quot;Peaceable Kingdom&quot; paintings of Quaker artist Edward Hicks that depict predators and prey together. He includes in the backgrounds elements from his own time—soldiers, graveyards, war planes, and bombs—that are at odds with the peace depicted in the foreground. In &quot;The Knowledge of God&quot; and &quot;The Holy Mountain III&quot;, the tiny brown figure hanging in the trees refers to the ongoing scourge of lynching in the racially segregated southern United States. He inscribes on each a date significant from WWII. &quot;The Holy Mountain I&quot; is marked with &quot;June 6, 1944&quot;, the date of the Allied landings at Normandy, known as of D-Day. &quot;The Knowledge of God&quot; is marked &quot;Dec. 7 1944&quot;, the third anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Lastly, &quot;The Holy Mountain III&quot; is marked &quot;Aug 9, 1945&quot;, the day the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. Some have argued that centrally placed shepherd figure resembles the artist. As he did with other aspects of Pippin&#x27;s career, his dealer Robert Carlen took credit for exposing the artist to Hicks&#x27; series as he was a principal advocate for both autodidacts.

Pippin painted two self portraits, including one seated at the easel. His painting of &quot;John Brown Going to his Hanging&quot; (1942) is in the collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia is part of a trilogy on the abolitionist sometimes credited with igniting the Civil War.

Pippin made &quot;Mr. Prejudice&quot; in the midst of World War II at the request of an unidentified patron, probably for use as a poster or illustration. Inspired by the Allies&#x27; &quot;V for Victory&quot; slogan, the painting is unique in his oeuvre for its experimental composition and symbolic program. The relatively small image—about the size of a magazine cover—sorts the figures by race and scale around the central motif of a giant V that matches the typography used in support of the US war effort. That Pippin does not use the distinctive logo of Black Americans&#x27; &quot;Double V&quot; campaign, which advocated for military victory abroad &quot;and&quot; victory over racism at home, suggests he was aiming to speak to a national—that is, majority White—audience. The upper register is dominated by oversize figures representing symbols or concepts. At center, a White man with a sledgehammer—presumably, Mr. Prejudice himself—drives a wedge into the V. At left, a large, copper-colored Statue of Liberty raises her torch to light the way to freedom. Staring at her from the right is a broad, lighter-skinned figure dressed in red and holding a noose, while a hooded Klansman looms above him. The lower register is filled with smaller scale figures that are segregated by race, reflecting the contemporaneous situation in the military and, to a lesser degree, the war industries. On the left are Black uniformed military, a medic, and a machinist, most of whom face the viewer. Some have read the brown-skinned figure at center left, outfitted in an anachronistic WWI uniform, as a self-portrait. A similar group of White men fill the lower right quadrant, most turned to face their Black counterparts.

Pippin&#x27;s genre paintings are among his most popular works; see, for example, the &quot;Domino Players&quot; (1943), in The Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C., and several versions of &quot;Cabin in the Cotton&quot;. Some, including &quot;After Supper&quot; (–1939) and &quot;The Milkman of Goshen&quot; (1945)&quot;,&quot; relate to his childhood in New York State. Views of the everyday activities of Black families &quot;tended to be relatively invisible to the white masses&quot; before the Great Migration, so Pippin&#x27;s domestic scenes offered a privileged view.

Pippin also created images related to popular culture, including &quot;Old Black Joe&quot;, based on the song &quot;Old Black Joe&quot;; &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; and its many adaptations, and maybe the musical and film Cabin in the Sky. He made two portraits of the celebrated Black contralto Marian Anderson, not long after her famous 1939 concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and dedicated a painting to Paul Robeson.

Pippin left &quot;The Park Bench&quot; unfinished in his studio at this death on July 6, 1946. Romare Bearden later said: &quot;the man, I think, symbolizes Pippin himself, who, having completed his journey and his mission, sits wistfully, in the autumn of the year, all alone on a park bench.&quot;

==Collections and retrospective exhibitions==

Pippin painted about 140 works, many held in museum collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA; Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, PA; The Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia, PA; the Brandywine Museum of Art, Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania; the Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.; Baltimore Museum of Art, Baltimore, MD; and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA.

Pippin was the first Black American artist to be the subject of a monograph, Selden Rodman&#x27;s &quot;Horace Pippin: A Negro Painter in America&quot; of 1947. He has since been the subject of three major retrospective exhibitions, several scholarly books and articles, a book of poetry, and several children&#x27;s books.

<text>.dd was the assigned country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). It was chosen based on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the German Democratic Republic, the letters coming from the German name of the country, &quot;&quot;. In accordance with IANA policy, .dd was therefore available to be assigned as the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for East Germany. However, this was never done, and so .dd was never added to the root nameservers. Its only use was internally in an isolated network among the universities of Jena and Dresden.

With the reunification of Germany, East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), which had already been assigned the ccTLD .de. The ISO 3166-1 code &quot;DD&quot; was withdrawn in 1990.

<doc id="1245439" wikidata="Q3773842" url="?curid=1245439" title="Third Derby–Disraeli ministry">
<text>The Conservative government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland that began in 1866 and ended in 1868 was led by Lord Derby in the House of Lords and Benjamin Disraeli in the House of Commons.

==History==
Lord Derby became prime minister for the third time, after the fall of Lord Russell&#x27;s Liberal government, in 1866. His Chancellor of the Exchequer, Benjamin Disraeli, was instrumental in passing the Second Reform Act in 1867.

After the parliamentary session, which produced the Second Reform Bill, Disraeli&#x27;s eventual assumption of the leadership of the Conservative Party was all but assured. While he was still opposed by elements of the party&#x27;s right wing (most notably the Marquess of Salisbury, himself a future prime minister), his role in securing the passage of the bill, in particular his showing against William Ewart Gladstone, had won him the adulation of a wide base of the parliamentary party. The only unknown was the health of the Earl of Derby, still very much prime minister, Conservative leader, and Disraeli&#x27;s colleague.

Derby&#x27;s health, however, had been in decline for some time, and he finally resigned in February and advised Queen Victoria to send for Disraeli. Thus on 27 February 1868 Benjamin Disraeli became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He reportedly said of the event later, &quot;I have climbed to the top of the greasy pole.&quot; However, the Conservatives were still a minority in the House of Commons, and the enaction of the Reform Bill required the calling of new election. Disraeli&#x27;s term as prime minister would therefore be fairly short, unless the Conservatives managed to win the general election.

Although all the cabinet posts were at his disposal, Disraeli made only a few changes: he replaced Lord Chelmsford as Lord Chancellor with Lord Cairns, and brought in George Ward Hunt as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Disraeli and Chelmsford had never got on, and in Disraeli&#x27;s view, Cairns was a far stronger minister. He also chose the Earl of Malmesbury to succeed Derby as Leader in the House of Lords.

===The Irish Church===

The principal issue of the 1868 parliamentary session was the Irish Question, manifested this time in the debate over the Anglican Church of Ireland.

===Fate===
The Conservatives were defeated by the Liberals in the general election of 1868, and the new Liberal leader William Ewart Gladstone formed his first government.

==Cabinets==
===June 1866 – February 1868===

====Notes====
*This Cabinet of Derby&#x27;s is the first for which a complete collection of photographs exists of its members.

====Changes====
*March 1867: Lord Carnarvon, Lord Cranborne, and General Peel resign from the cabinet over the Reform Bill. They are succeeded by the Duke of Buckingham, Sir Stafford Northcote, and Sir John Pakington, respectively. Taking their places were three new members of the cabinet: the Duke of Marlborough, the Duke of Richmond, and Henry Lowry-Corry.
*May 1867: Gathorne Hardy replaces Spencer Walpole as Home Secretary. Walpole remains in the cabinet as Minister without Portfolio. Hardy&#x27;s replacement as President of the Poor Law Board is not in the cabinet.

===February 1868 – December 1868===

====Changes====
*September 1868: The Earl of Mayo leaves the cabinet to become Viceroy of India. His successor is not in the cabinet.

<text>Bernard Dillon (1888–1941) was an Irish jockey. Born at Caherina in Tralee, he joined his older brother Joe in 1901, both of them being apprentice jockeys at the famous Druids Lodge training establishment in Wiltshire England. Victory on Lemberg in the 1910 Epsom Derby was his most famous achievement, although he also rode winners in the 1,000 Guineas (Flair, 1906 and Electra, 1909), Lincoln (Uninsured, 1904), Cambridgeshire (Hacklers Pride, 1905), Eclipse Stakes (Lally, 1907 and dead heated on Lemberg in 1910), Coronation Cup (Pretty Polly, 1906) and the Grand Prix de Paris (Spearmint, 1906).

Dillon became the third husband of the Music Hall star Marie Lloyd. They met in 1910 and caused a scandal when, travelling together as &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Dillon&quot; in 1913, she was refused entry to the United States for &quot;moral turpitude&quot;. Alec Hurley, Lloyd&#x27;s true husband at the time, died two months later, and Dillon and Lloyd were married at the British Consulate in Portland, Oregon, on 21 February 1914.

During World War I, Dillon served in the transport lines at Belton Park, Grantham, the Machine Gun Corps training depot. He was not a good soldier, and was often in trouble. However, Marie Lloyd would travel to Grantham to upbraid any officer who had punished her husband. These officers would often go missing when she arrived.

After the war, Dillon began drinking heavily and abusing Lloyd, so that she began drinking as her own escape. In 1920, they separated, but Lloyd continued to slide downhill until she collapsed on stage in October 1922, dying three days later.

He was portrayed by actor Tom Payne in the 2007 BBC drama Miss Marie Lloyd - Queen of The Music Hall.

Bernard Dillon, nicknamed as &quot;Ben&quot; in the horseracing community, died in London in May 1941.

In 2024 a book was written by Stephen Fernane about Bernard&#x27;s life. &#x27;The Life and Times of Bernard Dillon: The Narie that Won the Derby&#x27; is a compelling account of Bernard&#x27;s turbulent life. For the first time, Bernard&#x27;s racing triumphs are researched in detail. The book also covers the tragic demise of one of Edwardian England&#x27;s most famous jockeys. The book is available at: www.buythebook.ie/bernarddillon

<text>Lenka Reinerová () (17 May 1916 – 27 June 2008) was an author from the Czech Republic who wrote exclusively in German. She was born in Prague.

== Life ==
Reinerová grew up in a German-speaking Jewish family, her mother a German-Bohemian from Saaz (Žatec) and her father an ironware dealer from Prague. Prior to World War II, she worked as a translator, an interpreter and an editor for the &quot;Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung&quot;. She fled to Paris in 1939 but after the beginning of the Second World War she was arrested and then interned in the camp of Rieucros in Southern France. She finally could leave the camp and reached Mexico at the end of 1941 where she stayed during the whole war. Among her companions during her exile in Mexico there were the communist and writer Egon Erwin Kisch. Both wrote for the German-language anti-fascist newspaper &quot;Freies Deutschland&quot;. She was the only member of her family to survive the Holocaust. In 1943, she married a fellow European Jewish exile, the writer and doctor (pseudonym of Dragutin Fodor); the couple, who met in Prague before the war, moved to Belgrade after the war, where they had a daughter Anna. 

The couple returned to Czechoslovakia after 1948. In the 1950s, Reinerová was jailed by Czechoslovak communist authorities and spent 15 months in prison; she recorded this experience in one of her novels, &quot;Alle Farben der Sonne und der Nacht&quot;. After her release she published sporadically. In 1958, she became the Editor of the German language publication &#x27;Im Herzen Europas&#x27; (In the Heart of Europe) published by the Orbis Publishing House in Prague ; in October 1968 she became the Editor in Chief. From the summer of 1968, and throughout the period following the Warsaw Pact invasion, Im Herzen Europas continued to support the Action Programme of the Communist Party. She remained as Editor in Chief until at least the end of 1969. Later she was not allowed to publish at all until the fall of communism., but in 1983 she began publishing some short stories at Aufbau Verlagsgruppe in East-Berlin. Since then, her works are still published at Aufbau. In 2004, she cofounded a cultural institution for German-language writing in the greater Czech region, the , with František Černý und Kurt Krolop.

On 25 January 2008, a speech Reinerová wrote but could not longer deliver personally due to ill health was read in German parliament in the course of an hour of remembrance for the victims of the Third Reich.

Reinerová had been largely a recluse ever since a spell in hospital in 2007, with the cause of her death not immediately known. Reinerová, the oldest living German-language writer in Prague, died on 27 June 2008 in Prague, in her apartment, at 92. Lucie Cernhousova, head of Literaturhaus, the Prague publisher of German-language writers, disclosed her death.

==Awards==
In 1999, she was awarded the Schiller Prize. In 2003, she won the prestigious Goethe Medal.

<text>Immaculata High School is a Roman Catholic high school in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, operated by the Ottawa Catholic School Board. It is currently located along the Rideau Canal in Old Ottawa East neighbourhood of Ottawa. Like other Catholic schools, it is publicly funded under the Ontario school system.

==History==

Immaculata High School was founded as an all-girls school in 1928 by Reverend J.J. O’Gorman, acting under the advice of higher ecclesiastical authority. He named the school &quot;Immaculata&quot;, and opened it with an initial enrollment of 85 run by a staff of 3 Grey Sisters as an alternative to public school education for girls of moderate income located at 211 Bronson Avenue. The girls paid a monthly fee of one dollar — if their families could afford it.
The site for the new school was the former Christie mansion property on Bronson Avenue at the corner of Lisgar Street, which was purchased for $25,000. W.E. Noffke, a well-known Ottawa architect, designed the school with eight classrooms, a science lab, a home economics classroom, a gymnasium and a stage area, and office space. A passageway linked the school to the former Christie mansion, which became the first convent home for the Grey Sisters who taught at the school. During the construction of the school building, the students of the newly formed Immaculata High School attended classes at St. Patrick’s Home, at the corner of Laurier Avenue and Kent Street. Sister Loyola was the first principal and the teachers were Sister Agnes of the Sacred Heart and Sister St. Geraldine.

By 1929, enrollment had increased to 160 students, and a new building with five classrooms, a science lab and a small library was constructed. In 1929, the first
commencement was held and a music department was established. In 1930, enrollment was 200 students and a commercial course was provided.

A home economics department and nine new classrooms were added in 1939 to meet the needs of the enrollment of 300 students, taught by nine Sisters.

In 1941, Principal Sister Mary Christine supervised a staff of 11. To meet the needs of the camera club, developing facilities and printing rooms were
added. In 1948, the enrolment at Immaculata was 425, and the staff now consisted of 17 Sisters.

The school&#x27;s Dr. B. Kearns Memorial Wing, which opened in September 1950, added eight classrooms, including a double-sized commercial classroom and space for the
Music Department. In 1952, an addition to the Kearns Memorial Wing added three new classrooms, a students’ library and a principal’s office.

In 1954, a new convent was constructed on the north side of the property. The former convent was renovated into 2 classrooms and space for the Music Department, which had a staff of 4. The enrollment was 725 students and the school now had a staff of 22.

In 1962, a chapel/auditorium was built, a project led by principal Sister Mary Christine. In 1967, another building was constructed with 12 classrooms, labs and a gym. Despite this, however, by 1972 the enrollment of Immaculata had dropped to 400 students.

As Immaculata celebrated its golden anniversary in 1978, male students were enrolled for the first time. In 1984, grades 7 and 8 students were added. When Immaculata marked its 60th anniversary in 1988, James J. Shea was appointed as the school’s first lay principal, overseeing an enrollment of 870 students.

After Immaculata celebrated its 65th anniversary in September 1994 (after 2 years of major renovations), the school moved to the current location at 140 Main Street. It has been declared an arts academy. 

The high school&#x27;s current location was originally built in 1929–1930 to house both St. Patrick&#x27;s High School and St. Patrick&#x27;s College (Ottawa), a now defunct Catholic post-secondary institution administered by the Oblate Fathers. In 1973, St. Patrick&#x27;s sold the building to Algonquin College, who operated a satellite campus there until it sold the building to the Ottawa Roman Catholic Separate School Board to house Immaculata in 1994. Edward Cuhaci was the architect for the renovations undertaken in 1994.

In 2000, a satellite classroom site for Immaculata High School was set up in the basement of St. Mary’s Home, to enable an initial enrollment of 10 pregnant teenagers from all schools in the city to continue with their academics during their pregnancies. The school held its first graduation in June 2000. In January 2002, the program, now called St. Mary’s Home Community Outreach, moved into 780 rue de l’Eglise.

Immaculata High School celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2003. In 2007, Principal Thomas D&#x27;Amico was named one of Canada&#x27;s Outstanding Principals. The school&#x27;s sports team is the Immaculata Saints, and the school mascot is the saint bernard &#x27;Bernie Mac&#x27;.

<doc id="1245460" wikidata="Q5156738" url="?curid=1245460" title="Composite Health Care System">
<text>The Composite Health Care System (CHCS) was a medical informatics system designed by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) and used by all United States and OCONUS military health care centers. In 1988, SAIC won a competition for the original $1.02 billion contract to design, develop, and implement CHCS.

SAIC later split into two separate organizations, and the company Leidos took control of CHCS and associated systems in 2016.

CHCS (and AHLTA) is being replaced by MHS Genesis, a Cerner product. The last AHLTA servers at MTF&#x27;s (Military Treatment Facilities) were shut down in early 2024. By October 2024, only a handful of CHCS servers remain on-line, with only 18 host sites compared to 105 host site systems prior to the deployment of MHS Genesis.

==Components and characteristics==
CHCS is module based: modules include RAD (radiology), LAB (Laboratory), PHR (Pharmacy), PAS (Patient Appointing &amp; Scheduling), MCP (Managed Care Program; used to support TRICARE enrollees by enrolling them to Primary Care Managers), PAD (Patient Administration): MRT (Medical Records Tracking), MSA (Medical Service Accounting) medical billing, WAM (Workload Assignment Module), DTS (Dietetics), CLN (CLinical: Nursing, Physician, and Allied Health), DAA (Database Administration), ADM (Ambulatory Data Module) Medical Coding of outpatient visits, and TOOLS (FileMan). 

Currently all appointments are booked in CHCS, except for Walk-Ins and Telephone Consults, which can now be booked in AHLTA. CHCS is a text based BBS/ANSI like display accessed via DEC VT320 terminal emulation. CHCS supports outpatient Order Entry (LAB, RAD, PHR, Consults (ancillary procedures), one-time and scheduled/multiple appointment consults. CHCS can also support Inpatient charting and Order Entry with multi-paging with a page for each ward the patient is transferred, but this feature is not fielded/enabled at many medical centers. Instead Clinicomp&#x27;s Essentris product is deployed at all MHS hospitals and has replaced the use of CHCS Inpatient module for nurse charting. An interface solution to allow Essentris Orders to be transferred into CHCS order entry is being deployed.

==AHLTA==

Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (commonly referred to as AHLTA) is the clinical documentation engine for the Physicians to write their notes, put in orders, document procedures performed and provide the basis of medical coding information. This information is then sent into CHCS and its subsystems (ADM - ambulatory data module) provide the official repository of the medical coding information and handle the transmission of those encounters via the Comprehensive Ambulatory Patient Encounter Record (CAPER) interface. The clinical data is brought into the M2 DataMart for use in research, operational metrics, trend analysis, and many other business intelligence processes/products. AHLTA information is also contained in a Central Data Repository (CDR). This CDR contains information from AHLTA, CHCS, and AHLTA-Theater. The AHLTA CDR is a comprehensive full scale world-wide EHR repository.

CHCS shares its original codebase with the VA&#x27;s VistA system. Since its inception it has been customized for supporting the Military and their family members.

Security in CHCS works by a number of mechanisms and includes the concept of least privilege. You are assigned the minimum needed for your work duties. This limits your access to sensitive data both protected by the Privacy Act 1974 and PHI protected under HIPAA. 

AdHoc reports can be written using the FileMan tools and can be quite powerful if the files are designed with that in mind. Many CHCS files are now more easily accessed with MUMPS routines that can make more efficient use of the internal data structures. More information about FileMan can be found at www.hardhats.org. CHCS, which now runs on InterSystems Caché with the MUMPS globals being converted into Caché objects and the MUMPS routines accessing them, now can be accessed with .NET tools to query the Caché database. Many facilities have developed special queries of CHCS or new tools to facilitate workflow and processes. One such tool is an intranet web application to facilitate printing of lab specimen labels to special printers with formats not possible with the regular CHCS print devices and label printing methods.

CITPO (now known as Defense Health Information Management Systems (DHIMS)) began the implementation of AHLTA, the DoD&#x27;s Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, in January 2004. The system links the 481 Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) worldwide as well as service members deployed abroad to the EHR, ultimately supporting 9.2 million MHS beneficiaries. The introduction of AHLTA, previously known as the Composite Health Care System II, ushered in a significant new era in health care for the MHS and the nation. AHLTA Version 3.3.3.X with client update 9.1 currently fielded to physician and clinic staff workstations. DHIMS also manages the AHLTA-Theater program that provides EHR capabilities to deployed users with important store and forward capabilities when communications are unavailable.

AHLTA and a significant portion of CHCS are slated to be replaced by a VA/DoD interagency iEHR program. The iEHR will bring together the strong Health IT resources of both the VA and the DoD to acquire the next generation EHR capabilities for both departments.

==Record Duplication==
As with all large hospital information systems, there are occasions that despite training and best intentions, duplicate patient records are created. CHCS has a function to merge patients, but not to unmerge. AHLTA also has merges performed on patients in its Oracle database and successful attempts are made to un-merge patients and their associated medical/encounter data where diligent research has determined that mistakes were made with the identification of patients and to split off encounter records from patients that are blended into the single AHLTA record. Master Patient Indexing is a feature of the AHLTA Clinical Data Repository (CDR). Over 100 CHCS host systems, DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System), and AHLTA Theater (the version being used in Iraq and other areas) all contributed patients into the CDR when it was created from 25 month data pulls back in 2004. Each CHCS patient registration links into AHLTA, some link to existing patients, but others are newly created. Complexity with patient names and methods of identifying them with other demographics can lead to duplication, both in a local CHCS system and in the central AHLTA CDR. There is currently a DHIMS contract working on improving the processes and automating the routines to resolve duplicate patients and prevent their creation in future.

<doc id="1245462" wikidata="Q5504100" url="?curid=1245462" title="Friends' Ambulance Unit">
<text>The Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit (FAU) was a volunteer ambulance service, founded by individual members of the British Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), in line with their Peace Testimony. The FAU operated from 1914 to 1919, 1939 to 1946 and 1946 to 1959 in 25 countries. It was independent of the Quakers&#x27; organisation and chiefly staffed by registered conscientious objectors.

==History==

===First World War===
The group that became the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit began with 60 volunteers, brought together by Philip J. Baker via an appeal published in &quot;The Friend&quot;. His letter was controversial; in the weeks following its publication, &quot;The Friend&quot; published several subsequent letters debating the concept of a Quaker ambulance unit. Despite this, Baker eventually secured material support and access to a training ground. His initial group of volunteers was trained at Jordans, a hamlet in Buckinghamshire that was a centre for Quakerism.

Their training was initiated without an immediate plan for mobilisation. By its end, in mid-October 1914, no clear opportunity had appeared, and the trainees were sent back to their homes. At the same time, the lack of sufficient medical care on the war front was becoming increasingly apparent to military authorities. An acquaintance of Baker&#x27;s, Sir Arthur Stanley, was chairman of the British Red Cross Society&#x27;s Joint War Commission. After receiving a report on the dire needs of the wounded from the war reporter Geoffrey Winthrop Young, Stanley was reminded of the Quaker volunteers, and suggested their deployment.

====Early activities====

In late October 1914, 43 of Baker’s volunteers were formally mobilised as the The First Anglo-Belgian Ambulance Unit, later renamed the Friends’ Ambulance Unit. This Unit was organised under the supervision of the Joint War Committee. 

They were pressed into service almost immediately. While making their initial voyage from Dover to Dunkirk, the FAU encountered the HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;, sinking after being struck by a German torpedo, and rendered emergency aid to her crew. The volunteers had no chance to rest when they actually reached Dunkirk. Upon their arrival, they were again immediately called to provide medical care, this time for a group of around 3,000 badly wounded soldiers sheltering in nearby railway sheds.

Once the situation at the railway sheds was under control, the Unit searched for additional ways to be of service. At first, they primarily worked alongside the French Armed Forces Health Service. Their first hospital, the Hospital St. Pierre, was opened in Dunkirk in coordination with the Service. This partnership also allowed them to begin their ambulance work in earnest, evacuating French wounded from the Ypres front near Woesten. By early 1915,The Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit had established relationships with French, Belgian, and British military authorities, as well as an additional military hospital.

====Civilian relief in Ypres====

As the Unit developed its ambulance service in Ypres, they discovered an emerging civilian crisis. Though the majority of Ypres’ civilians had been evacuated by late 1914, a large number remained behind, hidden in cellars and scattered across the countryside. These civilians were vulnerable to illness, malnutrition, and the deadly violence of an active war zone. The Unit quickly mounted a response.

Between the First and Second Battle of Ypres, the FAU established two civilian hospitals in the area: the Chateau Elisabeth in Poperinghe, and the Sacré Couer in Ypres itself. Their humanitarian work was made possible through cooperation with local partners, such as Father Charles Camiel Delaere and the Sisters of La Motte. These partners provided translation services, material support, staffing, and leadership. Besides medical aid, the Unit’s relief activities eventually expanded to include supply distribution, organizing gainful employment for refugees, screening for typhoid, and inoculation.

The outbreak of the Second Battle of Ypres, which involved the first significant use of gas weaponry on the Western Front, forced a rapid end to the FAU&#x27;s civilian relief in the region. As the fighting escalated, British military authorities ordered a definitive evacuation of all remaining civilians. The entirety of the FAU&#x27;s ambulance fleet was mobilised to support this effort. The final evacuation involved an estimated 5,000 civilians. 

The FAU was widely recognised for its exemplary service in Ypres. Besides the unit as a whole receiving letters of thanks from Flemish civilian organisations, Geoffrey Young (who served as a leader of the Unit) and Father Delaere both received the Order of Leopold for their work.

====After Ypres====

Between the end of their time in Ypres and early 1916, the FAU transitioned from an initial “knight-errant” stage, in which the Unit’s activities and relationships with military authorities were relatively fluid, to an organised and regularised unit. This was partly due to the British Military Service Act, which mandated conscription and defined the terms of exemption for conscientious objectors. Under these terms, the FAU was recognised as a legitimate form of alternative service for conscientious objectors, which led to the rapid expansion of the Unit and closer alignment with the British military in particular.

The FAU remained active throughout the war, and it continued to provide humanitarian aid for a year after Armistice. The Unit finally disbanded in 1919. By the end of the war, the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit’s volunteer staff had grown to over 1000 individuals, serving in France, Belgium, Italy, and in the Home Service Section. This number included 102 women. At various stages of the war, 420 additional volunteers were engaged with the FAU in various capacities.

===Second World War and aftermath===
It was refounded by a committee of former members at the start of World War II in September 1939 with the establishment of a training camp at Manor Farm, Bristol Road, Northfield, Birmingham. More than 1,300 members were trained and went on to serve as ambulance drivers and medical orderlies in London during the Blitz, as well as overseas in Finland, Norway and Sweden (1940), the Middle East (1940–1943), Greece (1941, 1944–1946), China and Syria (1941–1946), India and Ethiopia (1942–1945), Italy (1943–1946), France, Belgium, Netherlands, Yugoslavia and Germany (1944–1946) and Austria (1945–1946). Its first female member was Angela Sinclair-Loutit, who joined in 1940 after her studies at Somerville College, Oxford were interrupted.

====China Convoy====
The Sino-Japanese War had led to deteriorating conditions in China and in 1941 agreement was reached for the FAU to deploy 40 volunteers to deliver medical aid (dubbed the &quot;China Convoy&quot;). At first, their job was to secure the delivery of supplies via the &quot;Burma Road&quot;, the sole remaining route. When Burma fell to the Japanese in May 1942, the FAU volunteers escaped to India and China. They regrouped and took on the distribution of medical supplies delivered by &quot;The Hump&quot;, the air transport route to Kunming. It is estimated that 80% of medical supplies to China were distributed by the FAU.

The FAU&#x27;s role expanded and they provided a range medical treatments, preventative measures and training of Chinese medical personnel. This expanded further into the reconstruction of medical facilities, notably the hospital at Tengchong in 1944, and into agricultural improvements and training.

The activities in China were international, employing personnel, men and women, from Britain (the largest national group), China, United States, Canada, New Zealand and elsewhere. Around 200 foreigners and 60 Chinese took part, eight died and others had their health permanently damaged. About half of the recruits were Quakers but all had a commitment to pacifism and wished to deliver practical help. Most of the Chinese members were Christian students from the West China Union University of Chengdu.

Responsibility for the relief work in China was passed to the American Friends Service Committee in 1946.

====Northern Europe====
Two 12-man sections with eight vehicles, FAU Relief Sections Nos 1 and 2, landed at Arromanches, Normandy on 6 September 1944 from a tank landing craft. Attached to the British Army&#x27;s civilian affairs branch, the FAU sections provided relief to civilians in Normandy. No 2 FAU was then posted to a newly liberated refugee camp at Leopoldsburg, Belgium, managing reception, registration, disinfection, catering, dormitories and departures.

In November 1944, in response to a request from 21st Army Group, a further five more sections were established and arrived in Europe at the end of 1944. One new member was Gerald Gardiner, who subsequently became Lord Chancellor in Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour Party government of 1964–1970.

After a period in Nijmegen, assisting local civilian medical organisations during Operation Market Garden, No 2 FAU cared for a colony of the mentally ill near Cleves in Germany which grew to a population of 25,000. By April, the main work had become the accommodation and care of displaced persons until they could return home. No 2 FAU was heavily involved with the care and support of inmates at the newly liberated Stalag X-B prisoner-of-war camp near Sandbostel, between Bremen and Hamburg in northern Germany in May 1945.

The FAU was wound up in 1946 and replaced by the Friends Ambulance Unit Post-War Service, which continued until 1959.

The work of the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit was referred to in the 1947 award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Quakers worldwide and accepted by the Friends Service Council and the American Friends Service Committee.

==Purpose==
The original trainees in the 1939 training camp issued a statement expressing their purpose:

We purpose to train ourselves as an efficient Unit to undertake ambulance and relief work in areas under both civilian and military control, and so, by working as a pacifist and civilian body where the need is greatest, to demonstrate the efficacy of co-operating to build up a new world rather than fighting to destroy the old.

While respecting the views of those pacifists who feel they cannot join an organization such as our own, we feel concerned among the bitterness and conflicting ideologies of the present situation to build up a record of goodwill and positive service, hoping that this will help to keep uppermost in men&#x27;s minds those values which are so often forgotten in war and immediately afterwards.

<doc id="1245464" wikidata="Q4530009" url="?curid=1245464" title="Eidolon">
<text>In ancient Greek literature, an eidolon (; &#x27;image, idol, double, apparition, phantom, ghost&#x27;; plural: eidola or eidolons) is a spirit-image of a living or dead person; a shade or phantom look-alike of the human form. In the Homeric epic, plays two functions: only as an image of the dead; and, as the deceased &quot;in propria persona&quot;.

==Literary use==
The concept of Helen of Troy&#x27;s eidolon was explored both by Homer and Euripides. Homer uses the concept as a free-standing idea that gives Helen life after death. Euripides entangles it with the idea of &quot;kleos&quot;, the one being the product of the other. Both Euripides and Stesichorus, in their works concerning the Trojan Horse, use the concept of the eidolon to claim that Helen was never physically present in the city at all.

The concept of the eidola of the dead has been explored in literature regarding Penelope, who in later works was constantly laboring against the eidola of Clytemnestra and later of Helen herself. Homer&#x27;s use of eidola also extends to the &quot;Odyssey&quot; where, after the death of the suitors of Penelope, Theoclymenus notes that he sees the doorway of the court filled with them.

In &quot;Dream-Land&quot;, an 1844 poem by Edgar Allan Poe, an Eidolon rules over a realm haunted by &quot;ill angels only&quot; and reserved for the ones whose &quot;woes are legion&quot; and who &quot;walk in shadow&quot;.

Walt Whitman&#x27;s 1876 poem, Eidolon, used a much broader understanding of the term, expanded and detailed in the poem. In Whitman&#x27;s use of the term we can see the use broaden to include the concept of an oversoul composed of the individual souls of all life and expanding to include the Earth itself and the hierarchy of the planets, Sun, stars and galaxy.

Sandeep Parmar&#x27;s Eidolon won the Ledbury prize for a second collection.

<text>J Harlen Bretz (2 September 1882 – 3 February 1981) was an American geologist, best known for his research that led to the acceptance of the Missoula Floods and for his work on caves.

==Early life and education==
Bretz was born on 2 September 1882, in the small town of Saranac in Ionia County, Michigan. He was the first of Oliver Joseph Bretz and Rhoda Maria Howlett&#x27;s five children. His father was a farmer, and proud descendant of early German settler in Ohio, John Bretz.

The county&#x27;s birth registry recorded his name as &quot;Harlan J Bretz&quot; at birth, but he was listed as &quot;Harland J Bretz&quot; on the 1900 United States Census. When he entered college in 1901, he applied as &quot;J Harlen Bretz&quot;. At around the time he completed his graduate studies in 1913, he stopped using a point after the initial at &quot;J&quot;. According to his two children, his given name was actually &quot;Harley&quot;. Bretz&#x27;s daughter Rhoda Bretz Riley went on to explain that &quot;he invented the Harlen thing, just as he had invented the J in front of his name&quot;, though this contradicts official records. Most friends and associates just called him &quot;Doc&quot; in his later life.

Bretz earned an AB degree in biology from Albion College in 1905, then started his career as a high school History and Physiography (study of the physical features of the Earth&#x27;s surface) teacher in Seattle. During this time, he became interested in the geology of Eastern Washington, and began studying the glacial geology of the Puget Sound area. He continued his studies at the University of Chicago where he earned his PhD in geology in 1913. He became an assistant professor of geology, first at the University of Washington and then the University of Chicago.

In the summer of 1922, and for the next seven years, Bretz conducted field research of the Columbia River Plateau. Between the Summer of 1922 through 1931 he wrote 15 papers.

Since 1910 he had been interested in unusual erosion features in the area after seeing a newly published topographic map of the Potholes Cataract. Bretz coined the term Channelled Scablands in 1923 to describe the area near the Grand Coulee, where massive erosion had cut through basalt deposits. The area was a desert, but Bretz&#x27;s theories required cataclysmic water flows to form the landscape, for which Bretz coined the term Spokane Floods in a 1925 publication.

Bretz published a paper in 1923, arguing that the Channelled Scablands in Eastern Washington were caused by massive flooding in the distant past. This was seen as arguing for a catastrophic explanation of the geology, against the prevailing view of uniformitarianism, and Bretz&#x27;s views were initially discredited. However, as the nature of the Ice Age was better understood, Bretz&#x27;s original research was vindicated, and by the 1950s his conclusions were also vindicated.

Bretz encountered resistance to his theories from the geology establishment of the day. The geology establishment was resistant to such a sweeping theory for the origin of a broad landscape for a variety of reasons, including lack of familiarity with the remote areas of the interior Pacific Northwest where the research was based, and the lack of status and reputation of Bretz in the eyes of the largely Ivy League-based geology elites. Furthermore, his theory implied the potential possibilities of a Biblical flood, which the scientific community strongly rejected. The Geological Society of Washington invited the young Bretz to present his previously published research at a meeting on 12 January 1927, where several other geologists presented competing theories. Bretz saw this as an ambush, and referred to the group as six &quot;challenging elders&quot;. Their intention was to defeat him in a public debate, and thereby end the challenge his theories posed to their conservative interpretation of uniformitarianism.

Another geologist at the meeting, Joseph Pardee, had worked with Bretz and had evidence of an ancient glacial lake that lent credence to Bretz&#x27;s theories. Pardee, however, lacked the academic freedom of Bretz, as he worked for the United States Geological Survey, so did not enter the fray.

Bretz defended his theories, kicking off an acrimonious 40-year debate over the origin of the Scablands. As he wrote in 1928, &quot;Ideas without precedent are generally looked upon with disfavour and men are shocked if their conceptions of an orderly world are challenged&quot;.

Both Pardee and Bretz continued their research over the next 30 years, collecting and analysing evidence that eventually identified Lake Missoula as the source of the Spokane Floods and creator of the Channelled Scablands. Research on open channel hydraulics and NASA satellite images in the 1970s further vindicated Bretz&#x27;s and Pardee&#x27;s theories.

National Geographic observes: &quot;As philosopher Thomas Kuhn observed, new scientific truths often win the day not so much because opponents change their minds, but because they die off. By the time the Geological Society of America finally recognized Bretz’s work with the Penrose Medal, the field’s highest honour, it was 1979 and Bretz was 96 years old. He joked to his son, &quot;All my enemies are dead, so I have no one to gloat over.&quot;

==Caves and karst==
Bretz wrote an extremely influential paper on the morphology and origin of limestone caves in 1942, followed by detailed studies of the caves of Missouri in 1956, and Illinois with Stanley Harris, in 1961.

==Later life==
Bretz and his wife Fanny Belle Challis (1881–1972), whom he had met at Albion College, married in 1906, and had two children, Rudolf Challis Bretz and Rhoda Bretz Riley. The Bretz family settled in Homewood, Illinois where they bought property and constructed a Sears Catalog Home on it in 1921. Bretz nicknamed the property &quot;Boulderstrewn&quot; because of all the rocks and minerals he collected and was given that were placed around the property. He donated a portion of this collection to Albion College in the 1970s. Boulderstrewn was renowned for being an active place, where Bretz hosted many parties with students and faculty from the University of Chicago. His post-retirement body of work includes &quot;Geology of the Chicago Region&quot; (1955), &quot;The Caves of Missouri&quot; &quot;(1956),&quot; &quot;Washington&#x27;s Channeled Scabland&quot; (1959), &quot;Caves of Illinois&quot; (1961), and &quot;Geomorphic History of the Ozarks&quot; (1965), in addition to his 1949 &quot;Incomplete Genealogy of the Family of John Bretz Of Fairfield Co, Ohio, with a Partial History of One Line of Descent in this Family&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
The National Speleological Society made Bretz an honorary member in 1954.

Bretz received the Penrose Medal, the Geological Society of America&#x27;s highest award, in 1979, at the age of 96. After this award, he told his son: &quot;All my enemies are dead, so I have no one to gloat over.&quot;

Each year at Albion College, the J Harlen Bretz Award is given to the most outstanding senior in the geology department.

A plaque was dedicated to Bretz in 1994 outside the Dry Falls Visitor Center at Dry Falls State Park in Coulee City, Washington that reads &quot;Dedicated to J Harlen Bretz who patiently taught us that catastrophic floods may sometimes play a role in nature&#x27;s unfolding drama&quot;.

<doc id="1245479" wikidata="Q81213" url="?curid=1245479" title="Gerlachovský štít">
<text>Gerlachovský štít (, translated into English as &quot;Gerlachov Peak&quot;, German: &quot;Gerlsdorfer Spitze&quot;, Hungarian: &quot;Gerlachfalvi-csúcs&quot;), informally referred to as Gerlach, is the highest peak in the High Tatras, in Slovakia, and in the Carpathian Mountains. Its elevation is usually listed at 2654.4 m above mean sea level. The mountain features a vertical rise of approximately above the valley floor.

Mistaken for an average mountain in the rugged High Tatras range in the more distant past, it has since played a symbolic role in the eyes of the rulers and populations of several Central European nations, to the point that between the 19th and mid-20th century, it had four different names with six name reversals. Due to geopolitical changes, it was successively the highest mountain of the Kingdom of Hungary, and of Czechoslovakia, Slovakia and then Czechoslovakia again within the span of less than three decades of the 20th century.

Gerlachovský štít shares its geology and ecology with the rest of the High Tatras. With the travel restrictions imposed by the Eastern Bloc, the mountain was particularly treasured by Czechs, East Germans, Hungarians, Poles, and Slovaks as a high mountain available for them to climb. Although local authorities have since restricted access to the peak, it continues to attract its share of visitors.

== Names ==

=== Present ===
Gerlachovský štít means the &quot;Peak (of the village) of Gerlachov&quot;. The Slovak colloquial (unofficial) name is &quot;Gerlach&quot;. The Polish official names are &quot;Gerlach&quot; or &quot;Gierlach&quot;, while its Polish colloquial names are &quot;Girlach&quot; and &quot;Garłuch.&quot; The name of the village of Gerlachov itself is of German origin, because the Spiš region around the High Tatra Mountains in Slovakia used to be inhabited by German settlers for several centuries.

=== Past ===
The peak&#x27;s earliest recorded name was the Szepes-German &quot;Kösselberg&quot; (Cauldron Mountain) on a map from 1762. The Slovak name of the mountain was first recorded as &quot;Kotol&quot;, also meaning &quot;Cauldron&quot;, in 1821. Both names referred to the peak&#x27;s characteristic cauldron-like cirque.

Its current name became widely used in the 19th century, and links the mountain to the village of Gerlachov (Carpathian German: Gerlsdorf)) at its foot. The name &quot;Gerlsdorfer Spitze&quot; (Gerlachov Peak) was used by the first person to identify the mountain as the highest peak in the Tatras in 1838; this was rendered as &quot;gerlachovský chochol&quot; (Gerlach crest) in a Slovak version of his report in 1851. Several other mountains in the High Tatras have acquired their names from villages in the foothills.

Once it was determined that the mountain was the highest point in the region, the succession of the authorities that held control over it took an interest in its name and changed it periodically for symbolic reasons. In 1896, as part of Austria-Hungary, it was named after state Emperor Francis Joseph I. After the dissolution of the monarchy in 1918, the mountain continued to be known simply as &quot;Gerlachovský štít&quot; because it belonged to the village of Gerlachov. The Polish government, claiming the territory of the High Tatras for Poland, simultaneously called the mountain &quot;Szczyt Polski&quot; (Polish Peak), but never gained control over it. The new Czechoslovak government changed the name to &quot;Štít legionárov&quot; (Legionnaires Peak) in honor of the Czechoslovak Legions in 1923, but the name was dropped in favor of the earlier &quot;Gerlachovský štít&quot; in 1932. As a result of the Communist coup d&#x27;état in 1948, the mountain was renamed once more − to &quot;Stalinov štít&quot; (Stalin Peak) in 1949. Its traditional name &quot;Gerlachovský štít&quot; was restored yet again a decade later and has remained unchanged through the present.

== History ==

Gerlachovský štít was not always considered the highest mountain in the Tatras. After the first official measurement of peaks in the Tatras during the period of the Habsburg monarchy in the 18th century, Kriváň (2,494 m) was considered the highest. Other candidate peaks for the status of the highest mountain at that time were Lomnický štít (2,633 m) and Ľadový štít (2,627 m). The first person to accurately name Gerlachovský štít as the highest peak was the forester Ľudovít (Ludwig) Greiner in 1838. Greiner&#x27;s measurement was formally confirmed by an Austrian Army survey party in 1868. However, it was generally accepted only after the Vienna Military Institute for Geography issued a new, authoritative collection of maps of Central Europe in .

The first confirmed ascent was made by Ján (Johann) Still from the village of Nová Lesná in 1834. In 1880, the routes through the &quot;Velická próba&quot; (Velická Challenge) and &quot;Batizovská próba&quot; (Batizovská Challenge) were secured by chains.

== Access ==
Only members of a national Union Internationale des Associations d&#x27;Alpinisme (UIAA) club are allowed to climb the peak on their own. Other visitors have to take a certified mountain guide. The two easiest routes, usually up the &quot;Velická próba&quot; and down the &quot;Batizovská próba&quot; named after their respective valleys, are protected by chains. Because of an exposed section along the &quot;Velická próba&quot; and tricky orientation especially on the ridge, both are among the more difficult scrambling routes in the High Tatras. With no snow, guidebooks grade the routes as a II or III climb (UIAA scale) or lower. The route named &quot;Martinkova&quot; begins at Poľský hrebeň and leads to the summit along the ridge. The Martinkova route has two main variants; a short version starts at Litvorové sedlo and is considered easier, because it skips a section from Velický štít which requires abseiling.

The total elevation gain is about for those who spend the night at the Sliezsky Dom Hotel or are driven there by a mountain guide, and about for those who hike from Tatranská Polianka. In winter, Gerlachovský štít offers a challenging alpine climb, with mixed climbing and a risk of avalanches.

Two multi-pitch routes for technical climbing are on the eastern and south-western walls. Both are exceptionally long and situated on solid granite walls.

The route to Gerlachovský štít falls under the Tatra National Park ordinance, according to which hikers who depart from marked trails may be subject to fines unless they are UIAA members, or are led by a certified mountain guide. Camping is subject to similar restrictions. Rangers and some mountain guides are authorized to collect fines on the spot. Cairns that hikers build to mark the trail are periodically taken apart.

== Conditions at the summit ==

=== Weather ===

The effects of high-altitude weather on those who ascend Gerlachovský štít may be more pronounced than its altitude alone. The temperature gradient between the Tatra mountain resorts () and the summit can be steep. Low air temperature higher up can be masked by high insolation under clear skies, but will take its effect with increased cloud cover. Combined with windy conditions, the impact may be considerably detrimental even without rain or snow. The summit disappears in the clouds for periods of time on most days, which translates to fog at that elevation and a risk of disorientation.

While temperatures are somewhat lower on Gerlachovský štít because of its elevation, the weather and its potential impact on visitors is little different from other summits in the High Tatras both with and without marked trails. The typical daily weather pattern in the summer is a clear morning, clouds gathering by around noon, and occasional showers and storms in the afternoon. The chance of rain is lowest between 9–10 am and peaks between 2–3 pm, with a drop-off after 6 pm. The frequency of storms with lightning (as opposed to rainstorms) on Gerlach&#x27;s summit and on the other highest ridges is little different from lower elevations.

<text>Gustavo Henrique de Barroso Franco (born April 10, 1956, in Rio de Janeiro) is a Brazilian economist. Former Governor of the Brazilian Central Bank, is best known for being one of the &quot;fathers&quot; of the Real Plan, the 1994 monetary reform that ended hyperinflation in Brazil. He teaches economics at the Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro since 1986. He is also a businessman, consultant and has served on many boards. He founded Rio Bravo Investimentos where he works as Senior Advisor. He has written several books, academic papers and contributes regularly to newspapers and magazines.

==Early life and studies==
Franco was born in Rio de Janeiro on April 10, 1956. His mother Maria Isabel Barbosa de Barroso Franco, was from Teófilo Otoni, state of Minas Gerais, and his father, Guilherme Arinos Lima Verde de Barroso Franco, was born in Itacoatiara, at the backlands of the state of Amazonas. Guilherme Arinos made a career at Banco do Brasil and during the war started a lifelong friendship and association to President Getúlio Vargas. Arinos was a member of the first board of directors of the Brazilian National Development Bank, BNDES, and later, at the private sector, was a high ranked executive of Volkswagen do Brasil and one of the founders of Banco Garantia.

Gustavo Franco attended Colégio São Vicente de Paulo in Rio de Janeiro and Colégio Notre Dame de Sion in 1960/1974. He obtained a bachelor&#x27;s (1975–1979) and master&#x27;s (1983) degree in economics at the Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), where he developed interests in economic history and macroeconomics. At PUC-Rio he had his first job as teaching assistant working with Edmar Bacha, then preparing a macroeconomic textbook, self-defined as of a neo-structuralist approach, and later to become very popular in Brazil, with several editions

Winston Fritsch was his advisor in his M. A. thesis on the topic of financial euphoria and crash in the early years of the Brazilian Republic (1889-1890) and the attempts at monetary reform in connection either adhering to the gold standard or, alternatively to experience with fiat currency models, as proposed by Ruy Barbosa. His M. A. thesis was approved &quot;cum landae&quot; in 1982 and in 1983 won the prestigious &quot;Prêmio BNDES de Economia&quot; for the M. A. thesis in Brazil. This work was published as a book titled &quot;Monetary reform and instability during the republican transition&quot; (&quot;Reforma monetária e instabilidade durante a transição republicana&quot;&quot;) and became a reference to the period it covers.

In sequence, Franco was accepted in Ph.D programs in the universities of Chicago, Yale and Harvard, for which he headed. There he chose as fields of specialization, international economics under Jeffrey Sachs and economic history under Barry Eichengreen. He had brief fellowships at the CFIA (Center for International Affairs), CES (Centre for European Studies) and National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).

Sachs and Eichengreen were his supervisors, and along with MIT professor Lance Taylor, formed his thesis committee. Franco earned his Ph.D Degree at Harvard in 1986, with a dissertation titled &quot;Aspects of the Economics of Hyperinflations: Theoretical Issues and Historical Studies of Four European Hyperinflations of the 1920s&quot;. His original thesis had four theoretical chapters on topics as the adoption of indexation in contracts, inflation (stabilization) as public good problem, plagued by free rider issues, the inflation tax as motivation to the process and the dynamics of dollarization, distributive tensions and external balance. The applied chapters were case studies for Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Poland, also including some common themes like the relation between external imbalances, dollarization and fiscal reforms in the context of specific stabilization experiences.

This work was nominated to the David Wells Prize in Harvard and was awarded a national prize (&quot;Prêmio Haralambos Simionides&quot;) in 1987, for the best Ph.D. thesis or book in economics, given by the National Association of Graduate Studies in Economics (ANPEC, Associação Nacional de Centros de Pós Graduação em Economia).

== Teaching and research ==

Returning to Brazil in 1986, as a faculty member at the Economics Department at PUC-Rio, Franco worked as teacher, researcher and consultant from 1986 to 1993 when he was called to work with Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the newly nominated Finance Minister then starting his tenure.

He had an intense academic activity during these years; his research interests had three key themes: (i) on high inflation and on the basis of topics and issues raised in his doctoral dissertation; (ii) on Brazil&#x27;s economic history, mostly in connection with macroeconomic and monetary issues; and (iii) on trade policies, multinational enterprises and economic development, in collaboration with Winston Fritsch.

=== Hyperinflation ===
Two papers out of specific chapters of his doctoral dissertation were published in peer reviewed journals and had some relevant repercussion on his later work of fighting hyperinflation in Brazil:

&quot;Fiscal Reforms and Stabilization: four hyperinflation cases examined&quot; was published in &quot;The Economic Journal (&quot;vol. 100, no. 399, March 1990) disputed Thomas Sargent&#x27;s popular explanation to the sudden end of hyperinflation as result of a wide-ranging fiscal &quot;regime change&quot;. The role of dollarization and of currency reforms were wrongly downplayed by Sargent, as argued by Franco.

&quot;The Rentenmark Miracle&quot; published by &quot;Rivista di Storia Economica&quot; (Second Series, Volume 4, 1987), then republished in Barry Eichengreen (ed.) &quot;Monetary Regime Transformations&quot; London, Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd, 1991, was an account of the unique experience in Germany of Wertbestandiges Notgeld - that is, emergency monies of private issuance and with &quot;stable value&quot; as they had indexation clauses -, and the way this led to the rentenmark experience. As argued by Franco the rentenmark was a crucial step in the German stabilization, and not a &quot;cosmetic measure&quot;, as put by Thomas Sargent. In fact, the rentenmark model was very relevant for the design of the Brazilian 1994 monetary reform, known as &quot;Real Plan&quot;, in which a similar quasi-currency, under the name o URV (acronym for &quot;Unidade Real de Valor&quot;) played a vital role for the ending of Brazilian hyperinflation.

Much later, in 1995, Thomas Sargent wrote an article on the Brazilian URV, evoking the German experience with the rentenmark and arguing, as per the mathematician David Hilbert, that one could not solve the hyperinflation problem by &quot;changing the name of the independent variable&quot;. The URV, argued Sargent, would have been &quot;a sideshow that hasn&#x27;t touched the fundamental causes of inflation&quot;, and again Franco took issue with that, writing in 2017, but this time on the back of the successful adoption of the URV mechanism. According to Franco: &quot;Understandably&quot;, Brazilians &quot;did not take these observations seriously&quot; as &quot;the country was enchanted by the URV mechanism in view of practical problems it solved elegantly, efficiently and voluntarily, so that they received with blunt indifference a thesis from an outside observer claiming that the mechanism had no utility&quot;.

=== Economic history ===
In sequence to the work on monetary reforms in the early years of the Republic, Franco published several pieces on the Brazilian monetary experience in the years prior to the Great Depression. All this work is in Portuguese except &quot;Aspects of the Brazilian Experience with the Gold Standard&quot;, in Pablo Matín Aceña and Jaime Reis (orgs.) &quot;Monetary standards in the periphery: paper, silver and gold, 1854-1933 (&quot;London, Macmillan Press. 2000). Later, his research on the early years of the Republic would communicate well with his work of Machado de Assis newspapers articles as per his selection of chronicles under the title &quot;O olhar obliquo do acionista&quot; ( &quot;Shareholders oblique look&quot;, as literal translation).

=== Foreign trade and multinational companies ===
Franco worked in collaboration with Winston Fritsch in a series of projects supported by the OECD Development Center. One publication was &quot;Foreign direct investment and industrial restructuring: issues and trends&quot; (Development Centre Studies, OECD Development Centre, OECD, Paris, 1991), another was &quot;Efficient Industrialization in a Technologically Dependent Economy: The Current Brazilian Debate&quot; in &quot;Competition and Economic Development&quot; Committee of Competition Law and Policy, OECD, 1991.

In sequence, Franco and Fritsch worked in two projects directed by Gerry Helleiner for WIDER (World Institute for Development Economics Research) of the United Nations University during 1990 and 1991. The first was on the influence of trade orientation on development models and was published as &quot;Foreign Direct investment and patterns of trade and industrialization in developing countries: notes with reference to the Brazilian experience&quot; in G. K. Helleiner (org.) &quot;Trade Policy, Industrialization and Development: a reconsideration&quot;. (Oxford, Clarendon Press for UNU-Wider, 1992 ). The second, on the same issues but focused on trade and industrial policies was published as &quot;Import repression, productivity slowdown, and manufactured export dynamism: Brazil,1975-1990&quot; in Gerry Helleiner (org.) &quot;Trade policy and industrialization in turbulent times&quot; (London: Routledge for UNU-Wider, 1993, ).

Franco and Fritsch also worked in projects for UNCTAD and ECLA, and published in the academic circuit on these same issues. Franco would return to these themes only after 1995 when, as deputy governor of the Central Bank responsible for international affairs organized a Census on foreign direct investment into Brazil that has been conducted and published each five years since 1995.

== Public service ==
Between 1993 and 1999, Franco was active in public service. He started in May 1993 as Deputy Secretary of Economic Policy at the Finance Ministry up to October 1993 when he moved to the Central Bank of Brazil in the position of Deputy Governor responsible for International Affairs, position he occupied until 1997, and only interrupted by a brief tenure as governor of the Central Bank of Brazil between December 1994 and January 1995. On August 20, 1997 he was confirmed governor of the Central Bank of Brazil, until leaving on January 9, 1999, and briefly returning in March 1999 to transfer his functions to his successor Arminio Fraga.

=== Economic Policy Secretary ===
Franco served as Deputy Economic Policy Secretary at the Finance Ministry from May to October 1993 by invitation from the newly appointed Minister, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the fourth Finance Minister of president Itamar Franco, who had become president in December 1992 after the resignation of Fernando Collor de Mello. The other economists in the group were Winston Fristch, as Secretary of Economic Policy and Edmar Bacha as special adviser. In his memoir, Cardoso recollects that “with a small team facing a gigantic challenge, as a Brancaleone&#x27;s Army, ... we started to work, under a very discouraging political atmosphere”. This team faced a paradoxical pressure: &quot;not&quot; to repeat economic shocks &quot;and&quot; to produce some solution to inflation, then approaching 30% per month. The team&#x27;s first major announcement was described by Franco, as a “non-package” or rather “an ambitious collection of medium term fundamentalists agendas”, curiously named as PAI (acronym for &quot;Plano de Ação Imediata&quot;, Plan of Immediate Action), released on June 13, 1993. In sharp contrast with previous stabilization attempts, this document seemed to point that the Real Plan would start by the end offering “some sort of strategic planning of actions in issues associated with the so-called fiscal and monetary fundamentals to stabilization”.

=== Deputy Governor for International Affairs at the Central Bank ===
Franco was appointed Deputy Governor for International Affairs at the Central Bank on September 8, 1993, when Pedro Malan was appointed Governor. Simultaneously, Pérsio Arida was designated president of BNDES, and André Lara Rezende replaced Malan was chief negotiator of then pending Brazilian external debt. With this enlarged composition, the economic team around minister Cardoso started preparations towards the Real Plan.

In parallel, Franco had executive responsibilities in International Affairs at the Central Bank related to operational aspects of external debt restructuring under the Brady Plan, then at decisive moments, the administrative structures in charge of exchange controls, bound to be transformed by an ambitious deregulation process, the FOREX trading desk and international reserves management.

==== External debt, Brady Plan and new bond issues ====
At the moment Franco and Malan started working together at the Central Bank, the debt negotiation process was around the precise form of exchange of Brazilian currency denominated deposits owned by creditors (under the MYDFAs, Multi Year Deposit Facility Agreement) for newly issued bonds according to the Brady plan&#x27;s menu. In the final sequence of this process, Franco was in charge of the composition of the collateral guaranties for the new bonds under the Brady scheme. These guaranties would take the form of US Treasury Zero Coupon bonds with certain features, with a face value of approximately US$ 18 billion (and market value of US$ 2,8 billion) to be acquired with funds provided by the IMF under a stand-by agreement.

However, IMF representatives did not feel comfortable with the drafts of the Real Plan shown during the negotiations of the stand-by agreement and refused to go on with the loan, forcing the Brazilian authorities to develop some alternative strategy to acquire the US Treasury bonds in the secondary market using Brazil&#x27;s international reserves. The deal was described in detail in Guilherme Fiuza&#x27;s book in the chapter titled &quot;Sorry, Mr. Fagenbaum&quot;.

Right next to completing Brazil&#x27;s Brady Plan version, simultaneously with the Real Plan, Franco dealt with Paris Club debt and the Dart family, who did not wish to adhere to the Brady exchange. With these issues sorted out the challenge for the Republic was to return to international markets with new bonds and proceed with the building of a yield curve. The new program coordinated and executed by Franco comprised 16 new issues in 10 different currencies, between 1995 and 1998, totaling US$ 8,2 billion, including the issuance of the so called &quot;BR-27&quot; (the first 30-year bond voluntarily issued in decades, falling due in 2027) in exchange for cash and for Brady bonds, thus recovering the previously offered collateral in US Treasury bonds.

==== Forex deregulation and phasing out exchange controls ====
Exchange controls deregulation was one of the greatest challenges of the International Affairs section of the Brazilian Central Bank, a modernization imperative and an essential condition for the prevalence of supply and demand as determinants of the exchange rate.

The architecture of liberalization was based on the creation of new and segregated market for US Dollars in which rates were determined by supply and demand in parallel to the official market and to compete upfront with the “black market”. Initially fed only by Dollars sold by tourists, the scope of transactions was gradually extended, while, liberalization in the official market, along with a better balance of payments stance, resulted in gradually eliminating the spread between official and free markets.

From 1988 to 2006, when all legal markets were unified, deregulation consisted in expanding the nature of transactions that could take place in the free market, including gold related arbitrages, and remittances from non-resident local currency accounts, though always preserving full identification of players.

After 1995, under Franco&#x27;s direction, the Central Bank introduced several new rules for leads and lags in foreign trade, portfolio investment and turned “registry” of foreign capital inflows into a statistical event, and no longer dependent on authorization. Interestingly, however, one key innovation introduced along with liberalization of &quot;outflows&quot; was the selective restriction applied on certain types of &quot;inflows&quot;, mostly of a short-term nature. Capital surges had been producing restrictive measures in many countries, most visibly (for Brazilians) Chile, where restrictions took the form of a “quarantine”, or a minimum stay for foreign capital. In Brazil, instead, restrictions were implemented mostly as a tax of foreign exchange inflows, and without any “quarantine”. The formula was used many times over in later moments of foreign exchange abundance in order to reduce appreciation and/or extend maturities of foreign liabilities.

==Plano Real==
The Real Plan had as central element a monetary reform effected through three successive measures: the first and more important introduced on February 28, 1994, created the URV (Unidade Real de Valor) mechanism, that is, a &quot;money of account&quot; to be freely used in contracts and obligations in order to realign relative prices and coordinate price fixing around the exchange rate. It was also established that at some point in the near future, the URV would become the national legal tender to replace then circulating &quot;cruzeiros reais&quot;. Just like the German rentenmark, and reflected also previous models of monetary reform conceived by André Lara Rezende and Persio Arida. At this moment, the new national currency, the URV would have its denomination conveniently changed to &quot;real&quot;. The second, launched at July 1, 1994, complemented the reform, demonetizing &quot;cruzeiros reais&quot; and actually issuing the &quot;real&quot;. Also, this second instrument introduced some very important institutional changes in monetary governance, with a major reform in the National Monetary Council, and monetary policy. The third, closing the cycle of monetary reform, was a detailed statute for indexation practices that was implemented exactly one year after the real was first issued.

The URV existed as legal tender, though only as unit of account, during four months: its initial quote with respect to &quot;cruzeiro real&quot; was CR$647,50, more or less equivalent to one Dollar, as it was its final quote as CR$2.750,00, on July 1, 1994, when the &quot;cruzeiro real&quot; was demonetized and the URV was turned into the national currency and renamed as &quot;real&quot;. In consequence of this unusual parity it was not possible to stamp old &quot;cruzeiros reais&quot; notes, so that one entirely new family of notes was issued at once, a remarkably difficult logistics effort

At the day of the first issues of the new currency, in an unprecedented move, the Central Bank abstained from intervening in the foreign exchange market and let the new currency float. In consequence, the exchange rate between the URV (now the real) and the Dollar, fell below R$1,00 (i. e. it appreciated) with a great positive impact on expectations and marking the successful conclusion of the stabilization process first phase.

The combination of tight monetary policy with floating exchange rates, later under a &quot;target zone regime&quot;, or &quot;exchange rate bands&quot;, resulted immensely successful to eliminate hyperinflation, but remained one of the more controversial aspects of the Brazilian stabilization experience, and one generally addressed to Franco.

The results of the Real Plan on inflation, as measured by national cost of living index, IPCA - published by the National Statistics Bureau - IBGE, were as follows:inflation was running at 43,1% &quot;monthly&quot; (on average for he first semester of 1994), or 7.260% annually, up to July 1994, the first month of existence of the new currency. In July alone prices rose 6,8%, but the accumulated inflation for the next twelve months was only 33,0%. From this level onward, inflation goes on declining slowly: measured by IPCA, inflation fell below 20%, on a 12 months accumulated basis, only in April 1996, 22nd month after the introduction of the new currency; below 10% only in December, 30th month of the real. Within the calendar year of 1997, the rate of inflation was 5,2%, and in 1998 inflation was finally reduced to 1,6%, the lowest rate on record since the creation of the Brazilian Central Bank in 1964.

=== Institutional aspects and &quot;fundamentals&quot; ===
Before the Real Plan, five stabilization attempts failed between 1986 and 1991 all of which involving price freezes, all but one creating a new currency and one, the so-called Collor Plan in 1990, with an asset freeze much like monetary reforms in Europe following World War II. These failed experiments were called &quot;heterodox shocks&quot; not only because of direct intervention in prices and intrusive currency reforms, but also for their practical disregard of fiscal &quot;fundamentals&quot; and monetary policies. The Real Plan followed a different path opening several reforms agendas attacking fundamental disequilibria at the core of the hyperinflation process.

The first was related to the institutional organization of the monetary system. the National Monetary Council was recaptured and reduced to three members (ministers of Finance and Planning and the Governor of the Central Bank), recomposing the commitment of top level decision making to price stability. Sometime later a Monetary Policy Committee (known as COPOM - acronym of Comitê de Política Monetária) was created securing Central Bank&#x27;s independence in fixing the interest rate.

Next, federal banks, and especially Banco do Brasil, had to recognize previous losses, be recapitalized, abide by &quot;Basle Rules&quot; and cease to have unrestricted accommodation at the Central Bank. Provincial banks entered a severe adjustment program through which several liquidations and privatizations reduced their size to almost negligible. Some private banks in trouble entered a program through which the Central Bank financed liquidations, resolutions and changes in control of banking activities. It was a heavy agenda with the banking system, public and private, to reorder the monetary system and its governance.

There were numerous fiscal adjustment initiatives, starting with several rounds of debt refinancing with adjustment programs with the states during 1993–1998. The Federal Government gave accommodation to states in exchange for orthodox fiscal programs and several limitations as to their fiscal policies. These programs templates provided a framework to a new Public Finances Law, proposed in 1999, creating benchmarks and limitations for indebtedness and wages expenses, later approved under the designation &quot;Fiscal Responsibility Law&quot;, held to be a major progress in securing fiscal balance in the public sector in Brazil .

Another important initiative was the 1993 Constitutional Amendment known as Social Emergency Fund (&quot;Fundo Social de Emergência&quot;, approved during the constitutional revision in March, 1993) which removed most of earmarking in the budget, and allowing the National Treasury to regain control of budgeted expenses. Even so, primary fiscal results were weak during the first few years after 1994. Due to the advancement of reforms, these weak fiscal numbers did not become an issue until the Asian crisis in 1997 and especially in 1998 with the Russian crisis, when Brazil entered an agreement with the IMF and started a decade long period of primary surpluses at the level of 3% of GDP.

Franco left the Central Bank after the IMF Agreement and after the reelection of Fernando Henrique Cardoso for a second term in 1998. Franco received late in 1998 Euromoney&#x27;s prize “Central Banker of the year, 1998”.

Shortly after, Brazil moved into what was known as the &quot;tripoid&quot; policy: floating exchange rates, primary fiscal surplus and inflation targets. Brazil was ready, at this point, to switch from the exchange rate &quot;anchor&quot; into the inflation targets regime. Franco&#x27;s account of controversies around the use of the exchange rate in the stabilization effort and of the dialogue between short term policies and long term reform goals was laid out in several of his writings, some in English.

After a sabbatical year back at the Catholic University as full-time professor, Franco founded an investment company named Rio Bravo Investimentos, based in São Paulo, to manage mutual funds, structured products, and private equity, in association with Swiss Re. In August 2001 Rio Bravo acquired a broker dealer called Mercurio DTVM and started to manage REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) and also with the public distribution of securities. Rio Bravo developed investment banking activities from 2003, when it acquired the local operation of Dresdner Kleinworth Benson, until 2007 when these activities were transferred to Lehman Brothers.

Rio Bravo was active in private equity first through Rio Bravo Nordeste I FMIEE (focused on SMEs in the Northeast region), later, in 2007, with Rio Bravo Nordeste II, the largest regional private equity fund in the country. In February 2006 Rio Bravo acquired MVP Mercatto Venture Partners Ltda., renamed as Rio Bravo Venture Partners Ltda., a &quot;venture capital&quot; management company based in Rio de Janeiro. Later, in  October 2010, Rio Bravo raised its first private equity fund dedicated to investments in renewable energy.

In 2005 a Rio Bravo started Rio Bravo Project Finance Ltd to advise clients in infrastructure projects and also Rio Bravo Fundamental, a value driven listed equity mutual fund.

In May 2008 Rio Bravo spun off its real estate based securitization business into a new company called RB Capital, with no shareholding from Rio Bravo partners. In 2016 RB Capital had its control bought by Orix Group from Japan. In August 2016, Rio Bravo&#x27;s control was acquired by Fosun International, one of the largest private groups in China.

Franco has been a member of several boards. He is now active as board member of Banco Daycoval, Seguradora Pottencial and as Chairman of Instituto Millenium, a Brazilian think tank.

<text>Pavel Telička (born 21 August 1965) is a Czech lobbyist, politician and Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from the Czech Republic. He previously served as European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection from May 2004 to November 2004. He was a member of ANO 2011, part of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, until 2017 when he quit amid disagreements with leader Andrej Babiš.

He served as a Vice President of the European Parliament from January 2017 until 2019.

==Early life==
Telička was born in Washington, D.C. in 1965, the son of a communist diplomat. As a young man, he was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. He graduated from the Faculty of Law, Charles University in Prague, in 1986, and began working at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the following years, he held various positions in the ministry, including as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and in the Czech Mission to the European Union in Brussels. From 1998 onwards, he served as chief negotiator for the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union.

==European Union==
In February 2004, the Czech government nominated Miloš Kužvart, the former Czech Environment Minister, as a candidate for the EU commissioner. Kužvart, however, stepped down after his first visit as a candidate to Brussels, and Telička was drafted in to replace him.

When the Czech Republic entered the EU on 1 May 2004, Telička became a commissioner in the Prodi Commission, sharing the portfolio of Health and Consumer Protection with David Byrne. He held this post only until November 2004, and did not continue in the following Barroso Commission due to a Czech government crisis in summer 2004. He was succeeded as the Czech Republic&#x27;s commissioner by Vladimír Špidla, the former Prime Minister who resigned during the crisis.

In December 2004, Telička co-founded BXL Consulting with offices in Prague and Brussels, providing consultancy in EU affairs. As of 2014, the company is no longer active. In 2013, he supported ANO 2011, led by Andrej Babiš, in the Czech parliament elections; he was the party&#x27;s candidate in the 2014 European Parliament election. Since his election in July 2014, he was a vice-chair of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe until the 2019 European Parliament election. In June 2019, he was elected the first leader of the HLAS party.

He was also elected president of the Czech Rugby Union in November 2009.

<text>William Denison McKinney (September 12, 1931 – December 1, 2011) was an American character actor. He played the sadistic mountain man in John Boorman&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Deliverance&quot; and appeared in seven Clint Eastwood films, most notably as Captain Terrill, the commander pursuing the last rebels to &quot;hold out&quot; against surrendering to the Union forces in &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;.

==Early life==
William Denison McKinney was born September 12, 1931, in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He had an unsettled life as a child, moving 12 times. At the age of 19, he joined the Navy during the Korean War. He served two years on a mine sweeper in Korean waters, and was stationed at Port Hueneme in Ventura County, California. After being discharged in 1954, he settled in California, attending acting school at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1957. His classmates included Dustin Hoffman and Mako Iwamatsu. During this time, McKinney became an arborist to earn money, a job which he would hold until the mid-1970s.

==Career==
After the Pasadena Playhouse, McKinney moved on to Lee Strasberg&#x27;s Actors Studio, making his movie debut in exploitation pic &quot;She Freak&quot; (1967). For 10 years he was a teacher at Cave Spring Middle School. He made his television debut in 1968 on an episode of &quot;The Monkees&quot; and attracted attention as Lobo in &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;. The film &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1972) proved to be his breakthrough, playing the backwoods mountain man who violently rapes Ned Beatty&#x27;s character.

McKinney&#x27;s other films in the early 1970s included appearances in &quot;Junior Bonner&quot; (1972), &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Parallax View&quot; (1974).

It was with Clint Eastwood that McKinney would become most associated, becoming part of Eastwood&#x27;s stock company after they worked together in Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot; (1974).

He appeared in &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; (1976) under Eastwood&#x27;s direction. He appeared in six more Eastwood films, including &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; (1977), &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot; (1978), &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot; (1980) and &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; (1989).

Other memorable roles include Jay Cobb, who is done in by John Wayne in Wayne&#x27;s final film &quot;The Shootist&quot; (1976). He also appeared in such later films as &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999). He appeared in the television film &quot;The Execution of Private Slovik&quot; (1974) and guest-starred on such television shows as &quot;Sara&quot;, &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Columbo: Swan Song&quot; and &quot;In The Heat of The Night&quot;.

McKinney took up singing in the late 1990s, eventually releasing an album of standards and country and western songs appropriately titled &quot;Love Songs from Antri&quot;, reflecting Don Job&#x27;s pronunciation of the infamous town featured in &quot;Deliverance.&quot; One of his songs featured in the film &quot;Undertow,&quot; directed by David Gordon Green. He voiced Jonah Hex in an episode of &quot;&quot; called &quot;Showdown&quot;. He appeared in a cameo in &quot;2001 Maniacs&quot; (2005) and had a role in the Robin Hood–inspired horror film &quot;Sherwood Horror&quot; (2010).

==Death==
On December 1, 2011, McKinney died from esophageal cancer at his home in San Fernando, California. He was 80. McKinney&#x27;s death was announced on his Facebook page on the same day. The announcement read:
Today our dear Bill McKinney passed away at Valley Presbyterian Hospice. An avid smoker for 25 years of his younger life, he died of cancer of the esophagus. He was 80 and still strong enough to have filmed a Dorito&#x27;s commercial 2 weeks prior to his passing, and he continued to work on his biography with his writing partner. Hopefully 2012 will bring a publisher for the wild ride his life was. He is survived by son Clinton, along with several ex-wives. R.I.P. Bill sept.12 1931 – dec. 1 2011 .

<text>Trailokya (; ; , Tibetan: khams gsum; ; ) literally means &quot;three worlds&quot;. It can also refer to &quot;three spheres,&quot; &quot;three planes of existence,&quot; and &quot;three realms&quot;. 

Various schemas of three realms (tri-loka) appear in the main Indian religions of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.

== Hindu cosmology ==

The concept of three worlds has a number of different interpretations in Hindu cosmology. 

* Traditionally, the three worlds refer to either the earth (Bhuloka), heaven (Svarga), and hell (Naraka), or the earth (Bhuloka), heaven (Svarga), and the netherworld (Patala).
* The Brahmanda Purana conceives them to be Bhūta (past), Bhavya (future), and Bhavat (present). 
* In Vaishnavism, the three worlds are often described to be bhūr, bhuvaḥ, and svaḥ (the gross region, the subtle region, and the celestial region).
* In the &quot;Nilanamatapurana&quot;, Vamana covers his second step on the three worlds of Maharloka, Janaloka, and Tapaloka, all of which are regarded to be a part of the seven heavens.

== Buddhist cosmology ==

In Buddhism, the three worlds refer to the following destinations for karmic rebirth:
* Kāma-loka (world of desire), is a plane of existence typified by base desires, populated by hell beings, preta (hungry ghosts), animals, humans, lower demi-gods (asuras) and gods (devas) of the desire realm heavens.
* Rūpa-loka (world of form), a realm predominantly free of baser desires, populated by higher level devas. It is a possible rebirth destination for those well practiced in dhyāna (meditative absorption).
* Arūpa-loka (the world of formlessness), a non-corporeal realm populated with four heavens. It is a possible rebirth destination for practitioners of the four formlessness stages of meditation (arūpa-samāpatti).
According to Theravada Buddhism, these are all the realms of existence outside of nirvana, which transcends all three realms. According to Mahayana Buddhism however, the buddhafields (also known as pure lands) are lands which are beyond the three realms.

== Jain cosmology ==
The early Jain contemplated the nature of the earth and universe and developed a detailed hypothesis on the various aspects of astronomy and cosmology. According to the Jain texts, the universe is divided into 3 parts: 

* &quot;Urdhva Loka&quot; – the realms of the gods or heavens
* &quot;Madhya Loka&quot; – the realms of the humans, animals and plants
* &quot;Adho Loka&quot; – the realms of the hellish beings or the infernal regions

<text>Phèdre (; originally &quot;Phèdre et Hippolyte&quot;) is a French dramatic tragedy in five acts written in alexandrine verse by Jean Racine, first performed in 1677 at the theatre of the Hôtel de Bourgogne in Paris.

==Composition and premiere==
With &quot;Phèdre&quot;, Racine chose once more a subject from Greek mythology, already treated by Greek and Roman tragic poets, notably by Euripides in &quot;Hippolytus&quot; and Seneca in &quot;Phaedra&quot;.

As a result of an intrigue by the Duchess of Bouillon and other friends of the aging Pierre Corneille, the play was not a success at its première on 1 January 1677 at the Hôtel de Bourgogne, home of the troupe of actors in Paris. Indeed, a rival group staged a play by the now forgotten playwright Nicolas Pradon on an almost identical theme. After &quot;Phèdre&quot;, Racine ceased writing plays on secular themes and devoted himself to the service of religion and the king until 1689, when he was commissioned to write &quot;Esther&quot; by Madame de Maintenon, the morganatic second wife of Louis XIV.

==Characters==
Names of characters in French, with their equivalents in English:
* Thésée, or Theseus, King of Athens
* Phèdre, or Phaedra, wife of Thésée, daughter of Minos and Pasiphaë and sister of Ariadne
* Hippolyte, or Hippolytus, son of Thésée and Antiope, Queen of the Amazons
* Aricie, or Aricia, princess of the royal blood of Athens
* Œnone, or Oenone, nurse and confidante of Phèdre
* Théramène, or Theramenes, tutor of Hippolyte
* Ismène, confidante of Aricie
* Panope, lady-in-waiting to Phèdre

==Synopsis==
The play is set at the royal court in Troezen, on the Peloponnesus coast in Southern Greece. In the absence of her royal husband Thésée, Phèdre ends by declaring her love to Hippolyte, Thésée&#x27;s son from a previous marriage.

Act 1. Following Theseus&#x27;s six-month absence, his son Hippolytus tells his tutor Theramenes of his intention to leave Troezen in search of his father.
When pressed by Theramenes, he reveals that the real motive is his forbidden love for Aricia, sole survivor of the royal house supplanted by Theseus and under a vow of chastity against her will. During her husband&#x27;s absence, Phèdre has become consumed by an illicit but overpowering passion for her stepson Hippolytus, which she has kept as a dark secret. Close to death and reeling about half-dementedly, under pressure from her old nurse Oenone she explains her state, on condition that she be permitted to die rather than face dishonour. The death of Theseus is announced with the news that his succession is in dispute. Oenone urges her mistress that, since her love for her stepson is now legitimate, she should form an alliance with him, if only for the future benefit of the infant son of her own flesh.

Act 2. With fresh hope for her liberty, Aricia reveals to her maidservant Ismène her feelings towards Hippolytus, who promptly appears to declare his love for her. Their discourse is interrupted by Phèdre, who distraughtly pleads for the rights of her infant son, explaining her coldness and personal despair. Suddenly entering a trance-like state overcome by emotion, she involuntarily confesses her hidden passions to her horrified dumb-struck stepson. Sensing rejection, she leaves in a wild frenzy, demanding Hippolytus&#x27; sword to end her torment. Theramenes brings news to Hippolytus that Theseus might still be alive.

Act 3. In desperation Phèdre sends word to Hippolytus inviting him to share the crown of Athens. However, Oenone brings her the devastating news that Theseus has returned in perfect health. To avert Phèdre&#x27;s deathwish and her possible betrayal by Hippolytus, Oenone urges that a story should be concocted around his abandoned sword. Seeing Hippolytus by Theseus&#x27; side, Phèdre grants Oenone free rein. After his long period in captivity, Theseus is surprised by the cold reception from his wife and son, each anxious to conceal their passions: Phèdre, consumed by guilt; and Hippolytus, anxious to distance himself from his stepmother&#x27;s advances, but unable to tell his father of his love for Aricia.
Act 4. Theseus has just been told by Oenone that Hippolytus has attempted to take Phèdre by force. Overcome by rage, Theseus banishes Hippolytus and invokes the god Neptune, who has promised to grant any wish of Theseus, to avenge him by his son&#x27;s death. Protesting his innocence, Hippolytus discloses his secret love for Aricia to his incredulous father and leaves in despair. Fearing that she might be guilty for Hippolytus&#x27; death, Phèdre determines to reveal the truth to her husband, until she is told of Hippolytus&#x27; love for Aricia. Consumed by jealousy, she refuses to defend Hippolytus further, leaving his father&#x27;s curse to run its course. When Oenone tries to make light of her mistress&#x27;s illicit love, Phèdre in a towering rage accuses her of being a poisonous scheming monster and banishes her from her
presence.

Act 5. Hippolytus takes his leave of Aricia, promising to marry her in a temple outside Troezen. On witnessing the tenderness of their parting, Theseus begins to have doubts about his son&#x27;s guilt. He decides to question Oenone, but it is too late: Oenone has thrown herself to the waves. Theramenes brings news of his son&#x27;s death: Hippolytus&#x27; departing chariot has been interrupted by a terrifying horned monster rising from the waves; mortally wounded by Hippolytus, its death throes drive his horses into a wild frenzy; in their flight, the chariot is dashed against the rocks and their master dragged helplessly to his death. In the closing scene, Phèdre, now calm, appears before Theseus to confess her guilt and to confirm Hippolytus&#x27;s innocence. She finally succumbs to the effects of a self-administered draught of Medean poison, taken to rid the world of her impurity. As an act of atonement and in respect for his son&#x27;s parting promise, Theseus pardons Aricia and adopts her as his daughter.

==Phèdre&#x27;s ancestry and its curse==
The genealogy of Phèdre gives a number of indications as to her character&#x27;s destiny. Descended from Helios, god of the Sun, and Pasiphaë, she nevertheless avoids being in the judgmental presence of the sun throughout the play. The simultaneous absence of a god-figure combined with the continual presence of one has been extensively explored in Lucien Goldmann&#x27;s &quot;Le Dieu caché&quot;. This sense of patriarchal judgment is extended to Phèdre&#x27;s father, Minos, who is responsible for weighing the souls of the dead upon their arrival in Hades.

Phèdre is right to fear judgment; she is driven to an incestual love for her stepson Hippolytus, much like the other women in her family, who tended to experience desires generally considered taboo. Her mother, Pasiphaë was cursed by Aphrodite to fall in love and mate with a white bull, giving rise to the legendary Minotaur. Phèdre meets Theseus, her future husband, when he arrives on the Minoan scene to kill the monstrous Minotaur; by doing so, he is killing her half-brother.

==Reception==
&quot;Phèdre&quot; has been widely regarded as masterly, due to its tragic construction, deeply observed characters, richness of the verse, as well as the interpretation of the title role by Marie Champmeslé. Voltaire called it &quot;the masterpiece of the human mind.&quot; Contrary to Euripides, Racine has Phèdre die on stage at the end of the play; she thus has had time to learn of the death of Hippolyte. The character of Phèdre is considered one of the most remarkable in Racine&#x27;s tragic . The instrument of others&#x27; suffering, she is also the victim of her own impulses, a figure that inspires both terror and pity.

Certain lines from the play, such as &quot;&quot; (&quot;the daughter of Minos and Pasiphaë&quot;), have become classics in the French language; but despite the celebrated musicality of the alexandrine, Racine never wrote poetry just for the sake of beauty of sound. In the character of Phèdre, he could combine the consuming desire inherited from her mother with the mortal fear of her father, Minos, judge of the dead in Hades. Despite its author&#x27;s silence from 1677 to 1689, as time progressed &quot;Phèdre&quot; became one of the most famous of his plays. It is now one of the most frequently staged tragedies from the seventeenth century.

In his work &quot;Le Dieu caché&quot;, the 20th century author Lucien Goldmann extrapolates social theories of the role of the divine in French consciousness from thematic elements in &quot;Phèdre&quot;. Although &quot;Phèdre&quot; is perhaps less often studied at high school level in France than &quot;Britannicus&quot; or &quot;Andromaque&quot;, it is still frequently performed, and the eponymous role has been played by actresses such as Sarah Bernhardt and Isabelle Huppert.

==Adaptations==

===Stage===

The French baroque composer Jean-Philippe Rameau&#x27;s first opera &quot;Hippolyte et Aricie&quot; (1733) was based on Racine&#x27;s &quot;Phèdre&quot;, as was Simon Mayr&#x27;s 1820 opera &quot;Fedra&quot;.

The British poet laureate Ted Hughes produced a highly regarded free verse translation of &quot;Phèdre&quot;. This version was staged shortly before his death with Diana Rigg playing the title role. Another English production of the Hughes translation premiered at the Royal National Theatre in June 2009, with a cast including Helen Mirren as Phèdre, Dominic Cooper as Hippolytus, and Margaret Tyzack as Oenone. This production was digitally telecast live to cinemas around the world.

A new translation by Timberlake Wertenbaker premiered at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Autumn 2009.

The Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki announced that he was working on an opera of Phèdre for 2014.

===Novels===
In the nineteenth century, Émile Zola loosely based &quot;La Curée&quot;, one of his books from the &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot; series (an exploration of genealogical and environmental influences upon characters), on Racine&#x27;s &quot;Phèdre&quot;. Marcel Proust devotes 20 pages of &quot;In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower&quot; to his experience of the Sarah Bernhardt &quot;Phèdre&quot; at the Opéra-Comique in Paris.

===Translations===
Robert Lowell&#x27;s English translation &quot;Phaedra&quot; was published in 1961.

Robert David MacDonald&#x27;s English translation, titled &quot;Phedra&quot;, was produced at The Old Vic in November 1984, designed and directed by Philip Prowse and with Glenda Jackson in the title role and Robert Eddison as Theramenes.

&quot;Phèdre&quot; was translated by Scottish poet Edwin Morgan (1920–2010) into Scots in 2000, and won the 2001 Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize.

===Musical settings===
François Mensonguée (1806-1877), the French Romantic composer, set a section of the second act to music for choir and organ in 1829 as his first published work.

<doc id="1245509" wikidata="Q164222" url="?curid=1245509" title="German Airways">
<text>German Airways Fluggesellschaft [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]], operating as German Airways and formerly named &quot;Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter&quot; or &quot;LGW&quot; for short, was a German regional airline headquartered in Düsseldorf.

Originally LGW was an independent provider of scheduled and chartered low-volume passenger flights. After years of cooperation with Air Berlin, it eventually became a subsidiary of Air Berlin in 2017. After the collapse of Air Berlin it was purchased by Lufthansa in October 2017 and became a unit of the group&#x27;s low-cost carrier Eurowings. Zeitfracht Group completed the purchase of LGW from Lufthansa on 1 April 2019 and renamed it in early 2020. The contract with Eurowings was terminated in April 2020 and LGW filed for insolvency. 

Its former sister company German Regional Airlines continues to operate using the German Airways brand.

==History==

===Independent company===
Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter was founded in 1980 by Bernd Walter, the owner of a flying school at Dortmund Airport. Initially, LGW offered on-demand charter and air taxi services. During the 1990s, the airline grew a network of scheduled domestic flights. At that time, it had 25 employees and the Dornier 228, with its capacity of 19 passengers, was the largest airliner in its fleet.

===Partnership with Air Berlin===
In 2007, LGW entered into a partnership with Air Berlin, which at the time was the second largest German airline. Effective 12 October of that year, LGW flights to Düsseldorf Airport and Berlin Tegel Airport were sold via the Air Berlin booking engine. In 2008, Air Berlin added the De Havilland Dash 8-400 to its fleet. The ten aircraft of that type were leased to LGW and operated on regional routes.

Subsequently, LGW discontinued its independent corporate identity. It no longer offered any chartered services, but operated scheduled flights on behalf of Air Berlin, using Air Berlin flight numbers and branding. The website &quot;lgw.de&quot; was shut down and replaced with a redirect to &quot;airberlin.com&quot;. On 2 March 2009, Air Berlin notified the Federal Cartel Office that it would become the controlling shareholder of LGW.

As LGW staff did not have a collective agreement, salaries were considerably lower than at Air Berlin. To cut costs, Air Berlin transferred a large number of its staff to LGW (especially those whose fixed-term contracts had expired). By the end of 2011, LGW had 110 employees. By early 2013, they had grown to 480. Since that year, LGW also employed jet pilots, as a number of Embraer 190 aircraft were transferred to the airline from Niki (another Air Berlin subsidiary), the first of which arrived on 14 March and left the fleet in November 2013.

By spring 2015, LGW increased their fleet of De Havilland Dash 8-400s from 12 to 17.

In May 2017, Air Berlin announced plans to buy Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter outright, having held a controlling stake since 2009.

===Sale to Lufthansa===
Lufthansa bought LGW in 2017 as part of Air Berlin&#x27;s bankruptcy proceedings. After Air Berlin ceased operations on 27 October 2017, LGW started wetlease operations for Eurowings, taking over parts of the wetlease agreement previously provided by its parent for the Lufthansa subsidiary. In addition to its existing fleet of Dash 8-Q400 aircraft, it received 13 Airbus A320-family aircraft and started hiring crews in November 2017. The acquisition was closed in January 2018 after receiving approval from the European Commission on 21 December 2017.

In late 2018, all LGW Airbus A320 family aircraft were moved to other companies within the Eurowings network.

===Sale to Zeitfracht Group and rebranding===

In January 2019, it was reported that Lufthansa planned to sell LGW to &quot;Zeitfracht&quot;, which already owns German ACMI and charter airline German Airways (formerly branded WDL Aviation). Zeitfracht had already purchased parts of Air Berlin&#x27;s maintenance division. The deal was completed on 1 April 2019, following the approval of supervisory authorities and the fulfillment of customary conditions. The takeover also marked the beginning of a longer-term lease agreement between LGW and Eurowings.

In May 2019, LGW announced it would replace all of its De Havilland Dash 8-400s with newer Embraer 190s from late 2019. These aircraft will be operated for Eurowings as part of a long-term lease.

In March 2020, Zeitfracht announced a rebranding for LGW which became &quot;German Airways&quot; operating within the &quot;German Airways&quot; branding alongside sister company WDL Aviation. In April 2020, the company filed for insolvency with plans to restructure due to the cancellation of Eurowings&#x27; wetlease contract for their entire Bombardier DHC-8-400 fleet in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Destinations==
As of January 2019, German Airways operated European routes on behalf of Eurowings with a focus on Düsseldorf Airport, where most aircraft were based. This contract was terminated in April 2020.

==Fleet==
===Current fleet===
As of March 2020, the joint German Airways fleet consisted of the following aircraft

===Historical fleet===
Previously, LGW operated the following aircraft types under its own brand or on behalf of other airlines:

<text>Chocapic (also known as Koko Krunch in Asia and most of the Middle East) is a chocolate-flavored whole-grain breakfast cereal distributed by Nestlé in most of Europe, Asia, the Middle-East and Latin America. The cereal was introduced in 1984. It has been available to consumers in Portugal since 1986.

== Overview ==
The cereal consists of cocoa flavored wheat flakes. Chocapic is available in 30 grams, and 375 grams packages. The cereal&#x27;s mascot is Pico (Koko the Koala in Asia), a dog that loves chocolate, and is always referring to the fact that Chocapic has a strong chocolate flavour. In later advertisements he is seen with a child preventing several thieves from stealing the cereal and explaining the origin of Chocapic (the most usual explanation being that a balloon filled with chocolate burst and landed in a field, creating the choco petals).
A new product related to this cereal, Chocapic Duo, has been recently created, which features the usual chocolate petals, as well as white chocolate flavored petals.

==Similar products==
Similar in flavor and texture to Chocos by Kellogg&#x27;s. Somewhat similar to other chocolate-flavored cereals like Cocoa Krispies (also known as Coco Pops or Choco Krispies outside North America) and Cocoa Puffs (Nesquik outside North America).

<text>The history of mobile phones covers mobile communication devices that connect wirelessly to the public switched telephone network.

While the transmission of speech by signal has a long history, the first devices that were wireless, mobile, and also capable of connecting to the standard telephone network are much more recent. The first such devices were barely portable compared to today&#x27;s compact hand-held devices, and their use was clumsy.

Drastic changes have taken place in both the networking of wireless communication and the prevalence of its use, with smartphones becoming common globally and a growing proportion of Internet access now done via mobile broadband.

==Foundations==
===Predecessors===
In 1908, Professor Albert Jahn and the Oakland Transcontinental Aerial Telephone and Power Company claimed to have developed a wireless telephone. They were accused of fraud and the charge was then dropped, but they do not really seem to have proceeded with production. In 1917, the Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt successfully filed a patent for a &quot;pocket-size folding telephone with a very thin carbon microphone&quot;. Beginning in 1918, the German railroad system tested wireless telephony on military trains between Berlin and Zossen. In 1924, public trials started with telephone connection on trains between Berlin and Hamburg. In 1925, the company was founded to supply train-telephony equipment and, in 1926, telephone service in trains of the Deutsche Reichsbahn and the German mail service on the route between Hamburg and Berlin was approved and offered to first-class travelers. 

Fiction anticipated the development of real-world mobile telephones. In 1906, the English caricaturist Lewis Baumer published a cartoon in &quot; Punch&quot; entitled &quot;Forecasts for 1907&quot; in which he showed a man and a woman in London&#x27;s Hyde Park each separately engaged in gambling and dating on wireless-telegraphy equipment. Cartoonist W. K. Haselden published &quot;The Pocket Telephone: When Will It Ring?&quot; in 1919, depicting six awkward possibilities. In 1923, Ilya Ehrenburg casually listed &quot;pocket telephones&quot; among the achievements of contemporary technology in a story in his collection &quot;Thirteen Pipes&quot; (). In 1926, the artist Karl Arnold drew a visionary cartoon about the use of mobile phones in the street, in the picture &quot;wireless telephony&quot;, published in the German satirical magazine &quot;Simplicissimus&quot;. The popular American cartoon detective &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; acquired a two-way, atomic-battery-powered wrist radio in 1946, upgraded to a wrist TV in 1964.

The Second World War (1939-1945) saw the military use of radio-telephony links. Hand-held radio transceivers have been available since the 1940s. Mobile telephones for automobiles became available from some telephone companies in the 1940s. Early devices were bulky, consumed large amounts of power, and the network supported only a few simultaneous conversations. (Modern cellular networks allow automatic and pervasive use of mobile phones for voice- and data communication.)

In the United States, engineers from Bell Labs began work on a system to allow mobile users to place and receive telephone calls from automobiles, leading to the inauguration of mobile service on 17 June 1946 in St. Louis, Missouri. Shortly after, AT&amp;T offered &quot;Mobile Telephone Service&quot;. A wide range of mostly incompatible mobile telephone services offered limited coverage areas and only a few available channels in urban areas. As calls were transmitted as unencrypted analog signals, anyone with radio equipment that could receive those frequencies could eavesdrop. The commercial introduction (in Japan in 1979) of cellular technology, which allowed re-use of frequencies many times in small adjacent areas covered by relatively low-powered transmitters, made widespread adoption of mobile telephones economically feasible.

In the USSR, Leonid Kupriyanovich, an engineer from Moscow, developed and presented a number of experimental pocket-sized communications radios in 1957–1961. The weight of one model, presented in 1961, was only 70 g and could fit in a palm. However, in the USSR the decision at first to develop the system of the automobile &quot;Altai&quot; phone was made.

In 1965, the Bulgarian company &quot;Radioelektronika&quot; presented a mobile automatic phone combined with a base station at the Inforga-65 international exhibition in Moscow. Solutions of this phone were based on a system developed by Leonid Kupriyanovich. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to 15 customers.

Advances in mobile telephony can be traced in successive &quot;generations&quot; from the early &quot;0G&quot; services like MTS and its successor Improved Mobile Telephone Service, to first-generation (1G) analog cellular networks (1979–), second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks (1991–), third-generation (3G) broadband data services (launched commercially in 2001) to the fourth-generation (4G) native-IP networks (launched in 2006 in South Korea). 5G began deployment in 2019.

== Early services ==
=== MTS ===
In 1949, AT&amp;T commercialized Mobile Telephone Service. From its start in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1946, AT&amp;T introduced Mobile Telephone Service to one hundred towns and highway corridors by 1948. Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5,000 customers placing about each week. Calls were set up manually by an operator and the user had to depress a button on the handset to speak and release the button to listen. The call subscriber equipment weighed about 

Subscriber growth and revenue generation were hampered by the constraints of the technology. Because only three radio channels were available, only three customers in any given city could make mobile telephone calls at one time. Mobile Telephone Service was expensive, costing US$15 per month, plus $0.30–0.40 per local call, equivalent to (in 2012 US dollars) about $176 per month and $3.50–4.75 per call.

In the UK, there was also a vehicle-based system called &quot;Post Office Radiophone Service&quot;, which was launched around the city of Manchester in 1959, and although it required callers to speak to an operator, it was possible to be put through to any subscriber in Great Britain. The service was extended to London in 1965 and other major cities in 1972.

=== IMTS ===
AT&amp;T introduced the first major improvement to mobile telephony in 1965, giving the improved service the obvious name of Improved Mobile Telephone Service. IMTS used additional radio channels, allowing more simultaneous calls in a given geographic area, introduced customer dialing, eliminating manual call setup by an operator, and reduced the size and weight of the subscriber equipment.

Despite the capacity improvement offered by IMTS, demand outstripped capacity. In agreement with state regulatory agencies, AT&amp;T limited the service to just system wide. In New York City, for example, shared just 12 radio channels and typically had to wait 30 minutes to place a call.

=== Radio Common Carrier ===
Radio Common Carrier or RCC was a service introduced in the 1960s by independent telephone companies to compete against AT&amp;T&#x27;s IMTS. RCC systems used paired UHF 454/459 MHz and VHF 152/158 MHz frequencies near those used by IMTS. RCC based services were provided until the 1980s when cellular AMPS systems made RCC equipment obsolete.

Some RCC systems were designed to allow customers of adjacent carriers to use their facilities, but equipment used by RCCs did not allow the equivalent of modern &quot;roaming&quot; because technical standards were not uniform. For example, the phone of an Omaha, Nebraska–based RCC service would not be likely to work in Phoenix, Arizona. Roaming was not encouraged, in part, because there was no centralized industry billing database for RCCs. Signaling formats were not standardized. For example, some systems used two-tone sequential paging to alert a mobile of an incoming call. Other systems used DTMF. Some used &quot;Secode 2805&quot;, which transmitted an interrupted 2805 Hz tone (similar to IMTS signaling) to alert mobiles of an offered call. Some radio equipment used with RCC systems was half-duplex, push-to-talk LOMO equipment such as Motorola hand-helds or RCA 700-series conventional two-way radios. Other vehicular equipment had telephone handsets and rotary dials or pushbutton pads, and operated full duplex like a conventional wired telephone. A few users had full-duplex briefcase telephones (radically advanced for their day)

At the end of RCC&#x27;s existence, industry associations were working on a technical standard that would have allowed roaming, and some mobile users had multiple decoders to enable operation with more than one of the common signaling formats (600/1500, 2805, and Reach). Manual operation was often a fallback for RCC roamers.

=== Other services ===
In 1969, Penn Central Railroad equipped commuter trains along the New York-Washington route with special pay phones that allowed passengers to place telephone calls while the train was moving. The system re-used six frequencies in the 450 MHz band in nine sites.

In the UK, Channel Islands and elsewhere the &quot;Rabbit&quot; phone system was briefly used, being a hybrid of &quot;cell&quot; base stations and handsets. One major limitation was that you had to be less than feet (closer with buildings) from a base due to power limitations on a portable device.
With modern technology a similar variant is being considered for Apple&#x27;s new 4G &quot;smart watch&quot; so they can be used in large events in a broadly similar way to a femtocell.

=== European mobile radio networks ===

In Europe, several mutually incompatible mobile radio services were developed.

In 1966, Norway had a system called OLT which was manually controlled. Finland&#x27;s ARP, launched in 1971, was also manual as was the Swedish MTD. All were replaced by the automatic NMT, (Nordic Mobile Telephone) system in the early 1980s.

In July 1971, Readycall was introduced in London by Burndept after obtaining a special concession to break the Post Office monopoly to allow selective calling to mobiles of calls from the public telephone system. This system was available to the public for a subscription of £16 month. A year later the service was extended to two other UK towns.

West Germany had a network called launched in 1952 as the country&#x27;s first public commercial mobile phone network. In 1972, this was displaced by B-Netz which connected calls automatically.

== Cellular concept ==
In December 1947, Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young, Bell Labs engineers, proposed hexagonal cells for mobile phones in vehicles. At this stage, the technology to implement these ideas did not exist, nor had the frequencies been allocated. Two decades would pass before Richard H. Frenkiel, Joel S. Engel and Philip T. Porter of Bell Labs expanded the early proposals into a much more detailed system plan. It was Porter who first proposed that the cell towers use the now-familiar directional antennas to reduce interference and increase channel reuse (see picture at right) Porter also invented the dial-then-send method used by all cell phones to reduce wasted channel time.

In all these early examples, a mobile phone had to stay within the coverage area serviced by one base station throughout the phone call, i.e. there was no continuity of service as the phones moved through several cell areas. The concepts of frequency reuse and handoff, as well as a number of other concepts that formed the basis of modern cell phone technology, were described in the late 1960s, in papers by Frenkiel and Porter. In 1970, Amos E. Joel, Jr., a Bell Labs engineer, invented a &quot;three-sided trunk circuit&quot; to aid in the &quot;call handoff&quot; process from one cell to another. His patent contained an early description of the Bell Labs cellular concept, but as switching systems became faster, such a circuit became unnecessary and was never implemented in a system.

A cellular telephone switching plan was described by Fluhr and Nussbaum in 1973, and a cellular telephone data signaling system was described in 1977 by Hachenburg et al.

== Emergence of automated services ==
The first fully automated mobile phone system for vehicles was launched in Sweden in 1956. Named MTA (Mobiltelefonisystem A), it allowed calls to be made and received in the car using a rotary dial. The car phone could also be paged. Calls from the car were direct dial, whereas incoming calls required an operator to locate the nearest base station to the car. It was developed by Sture Laurén and other engineers at Televerket network operator. Ericsson provided the switchboard while Svenska Radioaktiebolaget (SRA) and Marconi provided the telephones and base station equipment. MTA phones consisted of vacuum tubes and relays, and weighed . In 1962, an upgraded version called &quot;Mobile System B (MTB)&quot; was introduced. This was a push-button telephone, and used transistors and DTMF signaling to improve its operational reliability. In 1971 the MTD version was launched, opening for several different brands of equipment and gaining commercial success. The network remained open until 1983 and still had 600 customers when it closed.

In 1958, development began on a similar system for motorists in the USSR named &quot;Altay&quot;. The main developers of the Altay system were the Voronezh Science Research Institute of Communications (VNIIS) and the State Specialized Project Institute (GSPI). In 1963, the service started in Moscow, and by 1970, was deployed in 30 cities across the USSR. Versions of the Altay system are still in use today as a trunking system in some parts of Russia.

In 1959, a private telephone company in Brewster, Kansas, US, the S&amp;T Telephone Company, (still in business today) with the use of Motorola Radio Telephone equipment and a private tower facility, offered to the public mobile telephone services in that local area of NW Kansas. This system was a direct dial up service through their local switchboard, and was installed in many private vehicles including grain combines, trucks, and automobiles. For some as yet unknown reason, the system, after being placed online and operated for a very brief time period, was shut down. The management of the company was immediately changed, and the fully operable system and related equipment was immediately dismantled in early 1960, not to be seen again.

In 1966, Bulgaria presented the pocket mobile automatic phone RAT-0,5 combined with a base station RATZ-10 (RATC-10) on Interorgtechnika-66 international exhibition. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to six customers.

One of the first successful public commercial mobile phone networks was the ARP network in Finland, launched in 1971. ARP is sometimes retrospectively viewed as a &quot;zero generation&quot; (0G) cellular network, being slightly above previous proprietary and limited coverage networks.

== Handheld mobile phone ==
Prior to 1973, mobile telephony was limited to phones installed in cars and other vehicles. The first portable cellular phone commercially available for use on a cellular network was developed by E.F. Johnson and Millicom, Inc. It was introduced by Millicom subsidiary Comvik in Sweden in September 1981.

Motorola was the first company to produce a handheld mobile phone. On 3 April 1973, Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher and executive, made the first mobile telephone call from handheld subscriber equipment, placing a call to Dr. Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs, his rival. The prototype handheld phone used by Dr. Cooper weighed and measured . The prototype offered a talk time of just 30 minutes and took 10 hours to re-charge. Commonly referred to as &quot;the Brick&quot;, it was not commercially launched until October 1983, and only then in the U.S.

John F. Mitchell, Motorola&#x27;s chief of portable communication products and Cooper&#x27;s boss in 1973, played a key role in advancing the development of handheld mobile telephone equipment. Mitchell successfully pushed Motorola to develop wireless communication products that would be small enough to use anywhere and participated in the design of the cellular phone.

==Early generations==

Newer technology has been developed and rolled out in a series of waves or generations. The &quot;generation&quot; terminology only became widely used when 3G was launched, but is now used retrospectively when referring to the earlier systems.

=== 1G – Analog cellular ===
The first automatic analog cellular systems ever deployed were NTT&#x27;s system first used in 1979 for car phones in Tokyo (and later the rest of the country of Japan), and the cellular systems released by Comvik in Sweden in September, NMT in the other Nordic countries in October of 1981.

The first analog cellular system widely deployed in North America was the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS). It was commercially introduced in the Americas on 13 October 1983, Israel in 1986, and Australia in 1987. AMPS was a pioneering technology that helped drive mass market usage of cellular technology, but it had several serious issues by modern standards. It was unencrypted and easily vulnerable to eavesdropping via a scanner; it was susceptible to cell phone &quot;cloning&quot; and it used a Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) scheme and required significant amounts of wireless spectrum to support.

On 6 March 1983, the DynaTAC 8000X mobile phone launched on the first US 1G network by Ameritech. It cost $100M to develop, and took over a decade to reach the market. The phone had a talk time of just thirty minutes and took ten hours to charge. Consumer demand was strong despite the battery life, weight, and low talk time, and waiting lists were in the thousands.

Many of the iconic early commercial cell phones such as the Motorola DynaTAC Analog AMPS were eventually superseded by Digital AMPS (D-AMPS) in 1990, and AMPS service was shut down by most North American carriers by 2008.

In February 1986, Australia launched its Cellular Telephone System by Telecom Australia. Peter Reedman was the first Telecom Customer to be connected on 6 January 1986 along with five other subscribers as test customers prior to the official launch date of 28 February.

=== 2G – Digital cellular ===


In the 1990s, the &#x27;second generation&#x27; mobile phone systems emerged. Two systems competed for supremacy in the global market: the European developed GSM standard and the U.S. developed CDMA standard. These differed from the previous generation by using digital instead of analog transmission, and also fast out-of-band phone-to-network signaling. The rise in mobile phone usage as a result of 2G was explosive and this era also saw the advent of prepaid mobile phones.

In 1991, the first GSM network (Radiolinja) launched in Finland. In general, the frequencies used by 2G systems in Europe were higher than those in the United States, though with some overlap. For example, the 900 MHz frequency range was used for both 1G and 2G systems in Europe, so the 1G systems were rapidly closed down to make space for the 2G systems. In the United States, the IS-54 standard was deployed in the same band as AMPS and displaced some of the existing analog channels.

In 1993, IBM Simon was introduced. This was possibly the world&#x27;s first smartphone. It was a mobile phone, pager, fax machine, and PDA all rolled into one. It included a calendar, address book, clock, calculator, notepad, email, and a touchscreen with a QWERTY keyboard. The IBM Simon had a stylus, used to tap the touch screen. It featured predictive typing that would guess the next characters as you tapped. It had applications, or at least a way to deliver more features by plugging a PCMCIA memory card into the phone. 
Coinciding with the introduction of 2G systems was a trend away from the larger &quot;brick&quot; phones toward tiny hand-held devices. This change was possible not only through technological improvements such as more advanced batteries and more energy-efficient electronics, but also because of the higher density of cell sites to accommodate increasing usage. The latter meant that the average distance transmission from phone to the base station shortened, leading to increased battery life while on the move.
The second generation introduced a new variant of communication called SMS or text messaging. It was initially available only on GSM networks but spread eventually on all digital networks. The first machine-generated SMS message was sent in the UK on 3 December 1992 followed in 1993 by the first person-to-person SMS sent in Finland. The advent of prepaid services in the late 1990s soon made SMS the communication method of choice among the young, a trend which spread across all ages.

2G also introduced the ability to access media content on mobile phones. In 1998, the first downloadable content sold to mobile phones was the ring tone, launched by Finland&#x27;s Radiolinja (now Elisa). Advertising on the mobile phone first appeared in Finland when a free daily SMS news headline service was launched in 2000, sponsored by advertising.

Mobile payments were trialed in 1998 in Finland and Sweden where a mobile phone was used to pay for a Coca-Cola vending machine and car parking. Commercial launches followed in 1999 in Norway. The first commercial payment system to mimic banks and credit cards was launched in the Philippines in 1999 simultaneously by mobile operators Globe and Smart.

The first full internet service on mobile phones was introduced by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in 1999.

=== 3G – Mobile broadband ===

As the use of 2G phones became more widespread and people began to use mobile phones in their daily lives, it became clear that demand for data (such as access to browse the internet) was growing. Further, experience from fixed broadband services showed there would also be an ever-increasing demand for greater data speeds. The 2G technology was nowhere near up to the job, so the industry began to work on the next generation of technology known as 3G. The main technological difference that distinguishes 3G technology from 2G technology is the use of packet switching rather than circuit switching for data transmission. In addition, the standardization process focused on requirements more than technology (2 Mbit/s maximum data rate indoors, 384 kbit/s outdoors, for example).

Inevitably, this led to many competing standards with different contenders pushing their own technologies, and the vision of a single unified worldwide standard looked far from reality. The standard 2G CDMA networks became 3G compliant with the adoption of Revision A to EV-DO, which made several additions to the protocol while retaining backwards compatibility:
* Introduction of several new forward link data rates that increase the maximum burst rate from 2.45 Mbit/s to 3.1 Mbit/s
* Protocols that would decrease connection establishment time
* Ability for more than one mobile to share the same time slot
* Introduction of QoS flags
All these were put in place to allow for low latency, low bit rate communications such as VoIP.

The first pre-commercial trial network with 3G was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in the Tokyo region in May 2001. NTT DoCoMo launched the first commercial 3G network on 1 October 2001, using the WCDMA technology. In 2002, the first 3G networks on the rival CDMA2000 1xEV-DO technology were launched by SK Telecom and KTF in South Korea, and Monet in the US. Monet has since gone bankrupt. By the end of 2002, the second WCDMA network was launched in Japan by Vodafone KK (now Softbank). European launches of 3G were in Italy and the UK by Three/Hutchison group, on WCDMA. 2003 saw a further eight commercial launches of 3G, six more on WCDMA and two more on the EV-DO standard.

During the development of 3G systems, 2.5G systems such as CDMA2000 1x and GPRS were developed as extensions to existing 2G networks. These provide some of the features of 3G without fulfilling the promised high data rates or full range of multimedia services. CDMA2000-1X delivers theoretical maximum data speeds of up to 307 kbit/s. Just beyond these is the EDGE system which in theory covers the requirements for 3G system, but is so narrowly above these that any practical system would be sure to fall short.

The high connection speeds of 3G technology enabled a transformation in the industry: for the first time, media streaming of radio (and even television) content to 3G handsets became possible, with companies such as RealNetworks and Disney among the early pioneers in this type of offering.

In the mid-2000s, an evolution of 3G technology began to be implemented, namely High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA). It is an enhanced 3G (third generation) mobile telephony communication protocol in the High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) family, also coined 3.5G, 3G+ or turbo 3G, which allows networks based on Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity. Current HSDPA deployments support down-link speeds of 1.8, 3.6, 7.2 and 14.0 Mbit/s.

By the end of 2007, there were 295 million subscribers on 3G networks worldwide, which reflected 9% of the total worldwide subscriber base. About two thirds of these were on the WCDMA standard and one third on the EV-DO standard. The 3G telecoms services generated over $120 billion of revenues during 2007 and at many markets the majority of new phones activated were 3G phones. In Japan and South Korea the market no longer supplies phones of the second generation.

Although mobile phones had long had the ability to access data networks such as the Internet, it was not until the widespread availability of good quality 3G coverage in the mid-2000s (decade) that specialized devices appeared to access the mobile web. The first such devices, known as &quot;dongles&quot;, plugged directly into a computer through the USB port. Another new class of device appeared subsequently, the so-called &quot;compact wireless router&quot; such as the Novatel MiFi, which makes 3G Internet connectivity available to multiple computers simultaneously over Wi-Fi, rather than just to a single computer via a USB plug-in.

Such devices became especially popular for use with laptop computers due to the added portability they bestow. Consequently, some computer manufacturers started to embed the mobile data function directly into the laptop so a dongle or MiFi was not needed. Instead, the SIM card could be inserted directly into the device itself to access the mobile data services. Such 3G-capable laptops became commonly known as &quot;netbooks&quot;. Other types of data-aware devices followed in the netbook&#x27;s footsteps. By the beginning of 2010, E-readers, such as the Amazon Kindle and the Nook from Barnes &amp; Noble, had already become available with embedded wireless Internet, and Apple had announced plans for embedded wireless Internet on its iPad tablet devices later that year.

== 4G – Native IP networks ==

By 2009, it had become clear that, at some point, 3G networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth-intensive applications, such as streaming media. Consequently, the industry began looking to data-optimized fourth-generation (4G) technologies, with the promise of speed improvements up to ten-fold over existing 3G technologies. The first publicly available LTE service was launched in Scandinavia by TeliaSonera, in 2009. In the 2010s, a 4G technology has found diverse applications across various sectors, showcasing its versatility in delivering high-speed wireless communication, such as mobile broadband, internet of things (IoT), fixed wireless access, and multimedia streaming (including music, video, radio, and television).

One of the main ways in which 4G differed technologically from 3G was in its elimination of circuit switching, instead employing an all-IP network. Thus, 4G ushered in a treatment of voice calls just like any other type of streaming audio media, using packet switching over mobile network via VoLTE.

== 5G – Cellular Mobile Communications ==

Deployment of fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks commenced worldwide in 2019. The term &quot;5G&quot; was originally used in research papers and projects to denote the next major phase in mobile telecommunication standards beyond the 4G/IMT-Advanced standards. The 3GPP defines 5G as any system that adheres to the 5G NR (5G New Radio) standard. 5G can be implemented in low-band, mid-band or high-band millimeter-wave, with download speeds that can achieve gigabit-per-second (Gbit/s) range, aiming for a network latency of 1 ms. This near-real-time responsiveness and improved overall data performance are crucial for applications like online gaming, augmented and virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, IoT, and critical communication services.

== Satellite telephone ==

A satellite phone is a type of mobile phone that connects to other phones or the telephone network by radio link through satellites orbiting the Earth instead of terrestrial cell sites, as cellphones do. Therefore, they can work in most geographic locations on the Earth&#x27;s surface, as long as open sky and the line-of-sight between the phone and the satellite are provided. The advantage of a satellite phone is that it can be used in such regions where local terrestrial communication infrastructures, such as landline and cellular networks, are not available. Satellite phones rarely get disrupted by natural disasters on Earth or human actions such as war, so they have proven to be dependable communication tools in emergency and humanitarian situations, when the local communications system have been compromised.

The Inmarsat system is the oldest, originally developed in 1979 for safety of life at sea, and uses a series of satellites in geostationary orbits to cover the majority of the globe. Several smaller operators use the same approach with just one or two satellites to provide a regional service. An alternative approach is to use a series of low Earth orbit satellites much closer to Earth. This is the basis of the Iridium and Globalstar satellite phone services.

=== Integration into conventional mobile phones ===
In the early 2020s, manufacturers began to integrate satellite connectivity into smartphone devices for use in remote areas, out of the cellular network range. The satellite-to-phone services use L band frequencies, which are compatible with most modern handsets. However, due to the antenna limitations in the conventional phones, in the early stages of implementation satellite connectivity is limited to satellite messaging and satellite emergency services.

In 2022, the Apple iPhone 14 started supporting sending emergency text messages via Globalstar satellites. In 2023, the Apple iPhone 15 added satellite communication with roadside service in the United States. In 2022, T-Mobile formed a partnership to use Starlink services via existing LTE spectrum, expected in late 2024. In 2022, AST SpaceMobile started building a 3GPP standard-based cellular space network to allow existing, unmodified smartphones to connect to satellites in areas with coverage gaps. In 2023, Qualcomm announced Snapdragon Satellite, the service that will allow supported cellphones, starting with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, to send and receive text messages via 5G non-terrestrial networks (NTN). In 2024, Iridium introduced Project Stardust, a standard-based satellite-to-cellphone service supported via NB-IoT for 5G non-terrestrial networks, which will be utilized over Iridium&#x27;s existing low-earth orbit satellites. Scheduled for launch in 2026, the service provides messaging, emergency communications and IoT for devices like cars, smartphones, tablets and related consumer applications.

== Mobile device charger standards ==

Before a universal charger standard was agreed upon in the late 2000s, users needed an adapter which was often proprietary by brand or manufacturer to charge their battery. Later, mobile phones from major brands typically used a USB cable with a micro-USB or, since the mid-2010s, USB-C interface. Apple&#x27;s iPhone was the sole major brand to retain its own interface (30-pin dock connector replaced by Lightning in 2012). In 2023, Apple&#x27;s iPhone 15 series finally made the switch to USB-C, since then, all major brands used USB-C as the charger.

=== In China ===
, all new mobile phones applying for a license in China are required to use a USB port as a power port for battery charging. This was the first standard to use the convention of shorting D+ and D−.

=== OMTP/GSMA Universal Charging Solution ===

In September 2007, the Open Mobile Terminal Platform group (a forum of mobile network operators and manufacturers such as Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and LG) announced that its members had agreed on Micro-USB as the future common connector for mobile devices.

The GSM Association (GSMA) followed suit on 17 February 2009, and on 22 April 2009, this was further endorsed by the CTIA – The Wireless Association, with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) announcing on 22 October 2009 that it had also embraced the Universal Charging Solution as its &quot;energy-efficient one-charger-fits-all new mobile phone solution,&quot; and added: &quot;Based on the Micro-USB interface, UCS chargers will also include a 4-star or higher efficiency rating—up to three times more energy-efficient than an unrated charger.&quot;

=== EU smartphone power supply standards ===
In June 2009, many of the world&#x27;s largest mobile phone manufacturers signed an EC-sponsored Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), agreeing to make most data-enabled mobile phones marketed in the European Union compatible with a common external power supply (common EPS). The EU&#x27;s common EPS specification (EN 62684:2010) references the USB Battery Charging Specification and is similar to the GSMA/OMTP and Chinese charging solutions. In January 2011, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) released its version of the (EU&#x27;s) common EPS standard as IEC 62684:2011.

In 2022, the Radio Equipment Directive 2021/0291 required new smartphones to use USB-C as a universal charger by the end of 2024, and laptops by 2026.

<text>William Morse Davidson (December 5, 1922 – March 13, 2009) was an American businessman. He was president, chairman and CEO of Guardian Industries, one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturers of architectural and automotive glass. He was also owner of several North American professional sports teams and a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

The chairman of Palace Sports and Entertainment, Davidson was principal owner of the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association, the Detroit Shock of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association, and the co-owner of the Detroit Fury of the Arena Football League. Davidson also owned the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League and Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey League. His Pistons won the NBA Finals in 1989, 1990 and 2004; his Shock won the WNBA Finals in 2003, 2006 and 2008; his Vipers won the 1997 Turner Cup; and his Tampa Bay Lightning won the 2004 Stanley Cup.

==Early life and education==
A Detroit native, Davidson was born to a Jewish family on December 5, 1922; he was a 1940 graduate of Central High School. Davidson entered the University of Michigan in 1940, where he was a member of the track and field team; he majored in business at what is now the Ross School of Business. Davidson later joined the U.S. Navy and played Armed Forces Football during World War II.

Following the war, Davidson garnered his Juris Doctor degree from Wayne State University Law School in 1949. After three years of law practice, he rescued a wholesale drug company and a surgical supply company from bankruptcy.

==Career==

===Early career and family business===
Davidson would also take over his family&#x27;s Guardian Glass Co. in 1957, the same year the company declared bankruptcy. Guardian Glass would be the precursor to his company Guardian Industries, one of the largest glass suppliers in the world. Davidson encouraged risk-taking, discouraged second-guessing and was seen as aggressive. Not without controversy, Guardian was sued at least six times between 1965 and 1988. In 1989, Guardian was ordered to pay its competitor Johns Manville $38 million for stealing fibreglass-making technology. Guardian now stands as one of the world&#x27;s giants of glass manufacturing with facilities in Asia, Europe, Africa and South America in addition to its sprawling North American interests.

===Pistons ownership===
Being acquainted with football, Davidson wanted to acquire a football franchise. In 1974, Davidson and college classmate Oscar Feldman enlisted ex-Detroit Lions great Joe Schmidt to be part of a group bidding on the Tampa expansion franchise. The expansion fee soon grew too high for the group&#x27;s liking, and it bowed out of the bidding.

Two months later, Davidson learned that Pistons owner Fred Zollner was thinking of putting the team up for sale. Zollner had founded the Pistons in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1941 and moved them to Detroit in 1957. However, the Pistons had never turned a profit since the move to Detroit. Davidson and Zollner had known each other for some time, since they both had vacation homes in Golden Beach, Florida. Zollner quickly reached a deal to sell the Pistons to Davidson for $6 million, which closed in late 1974.

At the time, the Pistons played at 10,000-seat Cobo Arena in downtown Detroit. Davidson was displeased with this location, but opted not to join the Detroit Red Wings at the under-construction Joe Louis Arena. Instead, he relocated the team to the Pontiac Silverdome in 1978 and then to The Palace of Auburn Hills, the first NBA arena financed entirely with private funds, in 1988. To help pay the $90 million construction cost, the Bob Sosnick-designed arena featured lower-level suites, then a never-seen-before feature.

His Pistons were at the league&#x27;s forefront with respect to amenities. The franchise has a state-of-the-art practice facility, solely designed for the Pistons. During the offseason, team members are able to use the facilities while working on personal off-season conditioning goals. Against the advice of friends, Davidson was also the first owner to buy an airplane for his team, nicknamed Roundball One. Roundball Two, a newer, larger, multimillion-dollar aircraft refurbished with 42 luxury seats and a state-of-the-art video system, was purchased in the summer of 1998. Davidson was also the first to encourage globalizing the marketing of the NBA. He has been chairman of the Board of Governors and was active on several committees, including the one that selected former NBA Commissioner Larry O&#x27;Brien in 1975.

In 2009, the value of the Pistons franchise was estimated to be over $430 million. Regularly seen at the team&#x27;s home games, Davidson had said repeatedly that he would never sell the Pistons and the franchise would remain in his family after he died.

In 1999, Davidson put in an unsuccessful bid to purchase the Tampa Bay Lightning and gain a controlling interest in their home arena, the Ice Palace. He lost to insurance tycoon Art Williams, but only months later Williams sold the team to Davidson and Palace Sports at a huge loss. When Davidson acquired the Lightning franchise in 1999, the price was $100 million; its value has recently been estimated at $136 million. Tampa Bay won the Stanley Cup under Davidson&#x27;s ownership in 2004. On August 7, 2007, Davidson sold the Lightning franchise.

Davidson was honored by the Pistons in 2006 when he was given a banner next to the team&#x27;s retired numbers. His name (as &quot;Bill Davidson&quot;) was also placed on the Palace floor along with Pistons legends Dave Bing, Bill Laimbeer, Vinnie Johnson, Chuck Daly, Joe Dumars, Isiah Thomas and Bob Lanier.

In 2008, Davidson was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor for his successes as an owner of the Pistons and Shock. He was also an inaugural inductee into the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

At the time of his death, Davidson lived in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan with his wife, Karen. He had two children, Ethan and Marla, and three stepdaughters, including actress Elizabeth Reaser.

His combined business ventures led him to an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion, which led to &quot;Forbes&quot; ranking him as the 68th-richest man in the United States.

==Philanthropic activities==
A noted philanthropist, Davidson gave extensively to various organizations. He was one of the founders of the Pistons/Palace Foundation, a charity that has donated more than $20 million in cash and merchandise since 1989. In 1995, the foundation partnered with the City of Detroit&#x27;s Parks and Recreation Department to establish the Partnership to Adopt and Renovate Parks for Kids (PARK) Program, which provided restoration of Detroit parks, basketball courts, baseball diamonds, running tracks and playground equipment.

In 1992, the William Davidson Institute at the University of Michigan was created at Davidson&#x27;s alma mater, the Ross School of Business. A gift of $30 million was given to provide assistance in a special program to help develop market economies throughout the world. In total, Davidson&#x27;s gifts to the school exceed $55 million.

In 1997, the Council of Michigan Foundations honored Davidson for his lifelong philanthropic efforts locally, nationally and internationally. He was listed as one of America&#x27;s most generous donors in a New York Times article that same year.

Davidson enabled the Detroit Symphony Orchestra to make long-term touring plans both in the U.S. and internationally with a renewable $2 million donation. He pledged to fight cancer with a gift of $1 million to support collaborative research, prevention and early detection programs in breast and pediatric cancers at the Karmanos Cancer Institute and Children&#x27;s Research Center of Michigan.

After the Yom Kippur War, he and fellow Detroit-area philanthropist Lloyd J. Paul were flown to Israel by Prime Minister Golda Meir and given the Prime Minister&#x27;s Club Award for outstanding philanthropic deeds towards Israel. In 1999, Davidson gave $20 million to establish the Davidson Institute of Science Education at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. This was then the largest private donation ever given to the institute, a leading international science research center and graduate school. Davidson later added another gift of $15 million to the same institute. In addition, he endowed the William Davidson Graduate School of Jewish Education at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York with a $15 million gift. The excavations on the southern wall of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem have been named the Davidson excavations in tribute to his generous donations to the project. He also gave to the American Technion Society to establish the world&#x27;s first educational institution entirely dedicated to the international management of technology-based companies at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology. Davidson was also a contributor to the Wexner Foundation which gives grants to graduate students of Jewish studies. In March 2007, Davidson donated $75 million to the Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital in Jerusalem.

==Awards and recognition==
Davidson was decorated as Commander of the Order of the Oak Crown and as Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

==Personal life==
Davidson was married four times. He had two children:
*Ethan Daniel Davidson, a musician, who is married to fellow musician Gretchen Gonzales. He is active with the William Davidson Foundation.
*Marla Davidson Karimipour, married to Cyrus Karimipour.
In 1995, he married his fourth wife, Karen Weidman, who would convert to Judaism upon their marriage. She has three daughters from a prior marriage to John Reaser: Elizabeth Reaser, an actress with 30 movies and television shows to her credit (including the &quot;Twilight&quot; saga); Emily Reaser; and Mary Aaron.

The book &quot;The Wetsmans: Odyssey of an American Family&quot; was commissioned in 1988 by William M. Davidson, a grandson in the Wetsmans&#x27; family. For more information about the Wetsmans and their extended family, the book has been digitized and is available online.

===Death===
Davidson died on March 13, 2009, in his home at the age of 86. His health had been deteriorating for the years before his death; he had been using a wheelchair and very infrequently attended Pistons home games. The funeral was held at Congregation Shaarey Zedek, in Southfield, and Davidson was buried in the Clover Hill Park Cemetery, in Birmingham.

His widow Karen succeeded him as owner of the Pistons, and she sold all of Palace Sports &amp; Entertainment, including the Pistons franchise, to Platinum Equity founder Tom Gores in 2011 for a reported $325 million.

<text>Brigadier-General John Pocock (died April 1732) was a British Army officer and a Colonel of the King&#x27;s Regiment of Foot.

==Life==
Pocock obtained a commission in a regiment of foot in June 1695, and having signalised himself in the wars of Queen Anne, he was promoted to the rank of colonel in the Army in 1707. In 1710 he succeeded Lord Strathnaver in the colonelcy of a regiment of foot, with which he served in Flanders under the Duke of Marlborough, and afterwards under the Duke of Ormonde. At the Peace of Utrecht his regiment was disbanded, but in 1715 he was commissioned to raise a regiment of foot for the service of King George I. After the suppression of the rebellion of the Earl of Mar, this regiment was sent to Ireland, where it was disbanded in 1718. On 2 December 1720 Pocock was appointed to the colonelcy of the 36th Regiment of Foot, from which he was removed on 21 April 1721 to the 8th, or King&#x27;s Regiment. On the expectation that Great Britain would become involved in a continental war, in 1727, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general. He died in April 1732 at his house in Leicester Fields, London.

<doc id="1245556" wikidata="Q216810" url="?curid=1245556" title="King Kong">
<text>King Kong, also referred to simply as Kong, is a fictional giant monster resembling a gorilla, who has appeared in various media since 1933. Kong has been dubbed the King of the Beasts, and over time, it would also be bestowed the title of the Eighth Wonder of the World, a widely recognized expression within the franchise. His first appearance was in the novelization of the 1933 film &quot;King Kong&quot; from RKO Pictures, with the film premiering a little over two months later. 

A sequel quickly followed that same year with &quot;The Son of Kong&quot;, featuring Little Kong, also known as &quot;Kiko&quot;. The Japanese film company Toho later produced &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; (1962), featuring a giant Kong battling Toho&#x27;s Godzilla, and &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot; (1967), a film loosely based on Rankin/Bass&#x27; &quot;The King Kong Show&quot; (1966–1969). In 1976, Dino De Laurentiis produced a modern remake of the original film directed by John Guillermin. A sequel, &quot;King Kong Lives&quot;, followed a decade later featuring a Lady Kong. Another remake of the original, set in 1933, was released in 2005 by filmmaker Peter Jackson.

&quot;&quot; (2017), set in 1973, is part of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Monsterverse&quot;, which began with a reboot of &quot;Godzilla&quot; in 2014. A sequel, &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;, once again pitting the characters against one another, was released in 2021. It was followed by the film &quot;Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire&quot; in 2024, which featured more of Kong&#x27;s kind.

The character is an international pop culture icon, having inspired a number of sequels, remakes, spin-offs, imitators, parodies, cartoons, books, comics, video games, theme park rides, and a stage play. King Kong has also crossed over into other franchises, such as &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, and encountered characters from other franchises in crossover media, such as the Toho movie monster Godzilla, pulp characters Doc Savage and Tarzan, and the Justice League. His role in the different narratives varies, ranging from an egregious monster to a tragic antihero.

==Overview==
 The King Kong character was conceived and created by American filmmaker Merian C. Cooper. In the original film, the character&#x27;s name is Kong, a name given to him by the inhabitants of the fictional &quot;Skull Island&quot; in the Indian Ocean, where Kong lives along with other oversized animals, such as plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and various dinosaurs. An American film crew, led by Carl Denham, captures Kong and takes him to New York City to be exhibited as the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot;.

Kong escapes and climbs the Empire State Building, only to fall from the skyscraper after being attacked by weaponized biplanes. Denham comments, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t the aeroplanes, it was beauty killed the beast&quot;, for he climbs the building in the first place only in an attempt to protect Ann Darrow, an actress originally kidnapped by the natives of the island and offered up to Kong as a sacrifice (in the 1976 remake, her character is named &quot;Dwan&quot;).

A pseudo-documentary about Skull Island that appears on the DVD for the 2005 remake (originally seen on the Sci-Fi Channel at the time of its theatrical release) gives Kong&#x27;s scientific name as &quot;Megaprimatus kong&quot; (&quot;Megaprimatus&quot;, deriving from the prefix &quot;&quot; and the Latin words &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, means &quot;big primate&quot; or &quot;big supreme being&quot;) and states that his species may be related to &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;, but that genus of giant ape is more closely related to orangutans than to gorillas.

===Conception and creation===
Merian C. Cooper became fascinated by gorillas at the age of six. In 1899, he was given a book from his uncle called &quot;Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa&quot;. The book, written in 1861, chronicled the adventures of Paul Du Chaillu in Africa and his various encounters with the natives and wildlife there. Cooper became fascinated with the stories involving the gorillas, in particular, Du Chaillu&#x27;s depiction of a particular gorilla known for its &quot;extraordinary size&quot;, that the natives described as &quot;invincible&quot; and the &quot;King of the African Forest&quot;. When Du Chaillu and some natives encountered a gorilla later in the book he described it as a &quot;hellish dream creature&quot; that was &quot;half man, half beast&quot;.

As an adult, Cooper became involved in the motion picture industry. While filming &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; in Africa, he came into contact with a family of baboons. This gave him the idea to make a picture about primates. A year later when he got to RKO, Cooper wanted to film a &quot;terror gorilla picture&quot;. As the story was being fleshed out, Cooper decided to make his gorilla giant sized. Cooper stated that the idea of Kong fighting warplanes on top of a building came from him seeing a plane flying over the New York Insurance Building, then the tallest building in the world. He came up with the ending before the rest of the story as he stated: &quot;Without any conscious effort of thought I immediately saw in my mind&#x27;s eye a giant gorilla on top of the building&quot;. Cooper also was influenced by Douglas Burden&#x27;s accounts of the Komodo dragon, and wanted to pit his terror gorilla against dinosaur-sized versions of these reptiles, stating to Burden: &quot;I also had firmly in mind to giantize both the gorilla and your dragons to make them really huge. However I always believed in personalizing and focusing attention on one main character and from the very beginning I intended to make it the gigantic gorilla, no matter what else I surrounded him with&quot;. Around this time, Cooper began to refer to his project as a &quot;giant terror gorilla picture&quot; featuring &quot;a gigantic semi-humanoid gorilla pitted against modern civilization&quot;.

When designing King Kong, Cooper wanted him to be a nightmarish gorilla monster. As he described Kong in a 1930 memo: &quot;His hands and feet have the size and strength of steam shovels; his girth is that of a steam boiler. This is a monster with the strength of a hundred men. But more terrifying is the head—a nightmare head with bloodshot eyes and jagged teeth set under a thick mat of hair, a face half-beast half-human&quot;. Willis O&#x27;Brien created an oil painting depicting the giant gorilla menacing a jungle heroine and hunter for Cooper, but when it came time for O&#x27;Brien and Marcel Delgado to sculpt the animation model, Cooper decided to backpedal on the half-human look for the creature and became adamant that Kong be a gorilla. O&#x27;Brien on the other hand, wanted him to be almost human-like to gain audience empathy, and told Delgado to &quot;make that ape almost human&quot;. Cooper laughed at the end result, saying that it looked like a cross between a monkey and a man with very long hair. For the second model, O&#x27;Brien again asked Delgado to add human features but to tone it down somewhat. The end result (which was rejected) was described as looking like a missing link. Disappointed, Cooper stated, &quot;I want Kong to be the fiercest, most brutal, monstrous damned thing that has ever been seen!&quot; On December 22, 1931, Cooper got the dimensions of a bull gorilla from the American Museum of Natural History telling O&#x27;Brien, &quot;Now that&#x27;s what I want!&quot; When the final model was created, it had the basic look of a gorilla but managed to retain some human-like qualities. For example, Delgado streamlined the body by removing the distinctive paunch and rump of a gorilla. O&#x27;Brien would incorporate some characteristics and nuances of an earlier creature he had created in 1915 for the silent short &quot;The Dinosaur and the Missing Link&quot; into the general look and personality of Kong, even going as far as to refer to the creature as &quot;Kong&#x27;s ancestor&quot;. When it came time to film, Cooper agreed that Kong should walk upright at times (mostly in the New York sequences) in order to appear more intimidating.

===Etymology===
Merian C. Cooper said he was very fond of strong, hard-sounding words that started with the letter &quot;K&quot;. Some of his favorite words were &quot;Komodo&quot;, &quot;Kodiak&quot; and &quot;Kodak&quot;. When Cooper was envisioning his giant terror gorilla idea, he wanted to capture a real gorilla from the Congo and have it fight a real Komodo dragon on Komodo Island (this scenario would eventually evolve into Kong&#x27;s battle with the tyrannosaur on Skull Island when the film was produced a few years later at RKO). Cooper&#x27;s friend Douglas Burden&#x27;s trip to the island of Komodo and his encounter with the Komodo dragons was a big influence on the Kong story. Cooper was fascinated by Burden&#x27;s adventures as chronicled in his book &quot;Dragon Lizards of Komodo&quot; where he referred to the animal as the &quot;King of Komodo&quot;. It was this phrase along with &quot;Komodo&quot; and &quot;Kongo&quot; (and his overall love for hard sounding &quot;K&quot;-words) that gave him the idea to name the giant ape &quot;Kong&quot;. He loved the name, as it had a &quot;mystery sound&quot; to it.

After Cooper got to RKO, British mystery writer Edgar Wallace was contracted to write the first draft of the screen story. It was simply referred to as &quot;The Beast&quot;. RKO executives were unimpressed with the bland title. David O. Selznick suggested &quot;Jungle Beast&quot; as the film&#x27;s new title, but Cooper was unimpressed and wanted to name the film after the main character. He stated he liked the &quot;mystery word&quot; aspect of Kong&#x27;s name and that the film should carry &quot;the name of the leading mysterious, romantic, savage creature of the story&quot; such as with Dracula and Frankenstein. RKO sent a memo to Cooper suggesting the titles &quot;Kong: King of Beasts&quot;, &quot;Kong: The Jungle King&quot;, and &quot;Kong: The Jungle Beast&quot;, which combined his and Selznick&#x27;s proposed titles. As time went on, Cooper would eventually name the story simply &quot;Kong&quot; while Ruth Rose was writing the final version of the screenplay. Because David O. Selznick thought that audiences would think that the film, with the one word title of &quot;Kong&quot;, would be mistaken as a docudrama like &quot;Grass&quot; and &quot;Chang&quot;, which were one-word titled films that Cooper had earlier produced, he added the &quot;King&quot; to Kong&#x27;s name in order to differentiate it.

===Appearances and abilities===
In his first appearance in &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), Kong was a gigantic prehistoric ape. While gorilla-like in appearance, he had a vaguely humanoid look and at times walked upright in an anthropomorphic manner.

Like most simians, Kong possesses semi-human intelligence and great physical strength. Kong&#x27;s size changes drastically throughout the course of the film. While creator Merian C. Cooper envisioned Kong as being &quot;40 to 50 feet tall&quot;, animator Willis O&#x27;Brien and his crew built the models and sets scaling Kong to be only tall on Skull Island, and rescaled to be tall in New York.

This did not stop Cooper from playing around with Kong&#x27;s size as he directed the special effect sequences; by manipulating the sizes of the miniatures and the camera angles, he made Kong appear a lot larger than O&#x27;Brien wanted, even as large as in some scenes.

As Cooper said in an interview:

Concurrently, the Kong bust made for the film was built in scale with a ape, while the full sized hand of Kong was built in scale with a ape. Meanwhile, RKO&#x27;s promotional materials listed Kong&#x27;s official height as .

In the 1960s, Toho Studios from Japan licensed the character for the films &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; and &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot;. (See below)

In 1975, Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis paid RKO for the remake rights to &quot;King Kong&quot;. This resulted in &quot;King Kong&quot; (1976). This Kong was an upright walking anthropomorphic ape, appearing even more human-like than the original. Also like the original, this Kong had semi-human intelligence and vast strength. In the 1976 film, Kong was scaled to be tall on Skull island and rescaled to be tall in New York. Ten years later, Dino De Laurentiis got the approval from Universal to do a sequel called &quot;King Kong Lives&quot;. This Kong had more or less the same appearance and abilities, but tended to walk on his knuckles more often and was enlarged, scaled to .

Universal Studios had planned to do a King Kong remake as far back as 1976. They finally followed through almost 30 years later, with a three-hour film directed by Peter Jackson. Jackson opted to make Kong a gigantic silverback gorilla without any anthropomorphic features. This Kong looked and behaved more like a real gorilla: he had a large herbivore&#x27;s belly, walked on his knuckles without any upright posture, and even beat his chest with his palms as opposed to clenched fists. In order to ground his Kong in realism, Jackson and the Weta Digital crew gave a name to his fictitious species &quot;Megaprimatus Kong&quot; and suggested it to have evolved from the &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;. Kong was the last of his kind. He was portrayed in the film as being quite old, with graying fur and battle-worn with scars, wounds, and a crooked jaw from his many fights against rival creatures. He is the dominant being on the island, the king of his world. Like his film predecessors, he possesses considerable intelligence and great physical strength and also appears far more nimble and agile. This Kong was scaled to a consistent height of tall on both Skull Island and in New York. Jackson describes his central character:

In the 2017 film &quot;&quot;, Kong is scaled to be tall, making it the second largest and largest American incarnation in the series until the 2021 film &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;, in which he became the largest incarnation in the series, standing at . Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts stated in regard to Kong&#x27;s immense stature:

He also stated that the original 1933 look was the inspiration for the design:

Co-producer Mary Parent also stated that Kong is still young and not fully grown as she explains that &quot;Kong is an adolescent when we meet him in the film; he&#x27;s still growing into his role as alpha&quot;.

===Ownership rights===
While one of the most famous movie icons in history, King Kong&#x27;s intellectual property status has been questioned since his creation, featuring in numerous allegations and court battles. The rights to the character have always been split up with no single exclusive rights holder. Different parties have also contested that various aspects are public domain material and therefore ineligible for copyright status.

When Merian C. Cooper created King Kong, he assumed that he owned the character, which he had conceived in 1929, outright. Cooper maintained that he had only licensed the character to RKO for the initial film and sequel, but had otherwise owned his own creation. In 1935, Cooper began to feel something was amiss when he was trying to get a &quot;Tarzan vs. King Kong&quot; project off the ground for Pioneer Pictures (where he had assumed management of the company). After David O. Selznick suggested the project to Cooper, the flurry of legal activity over using the Kong character that followed—Pioneer had become a completely independent company by this time and access to properties that RKO felt were theirs was no longer automatic—gave Cooper pause as he came to realize that he might not have full control over this product of his own imagination after all.

Years later in 1962, Cooper found out that RKO was licensing the character through John Beck to Toho studios in Japan for a film project called &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;. Cooper had assumed his rights were unassailable and was bitterly opposed to the project. In 1963 he filed a lawsuit to enjoin distribution of the movie against John Beck, as well as Toho and Universal (the film&#x27;s U.S. copyright holder). Cooper discovered that RKO had also profited from licensed products featuring the King Kong character such as model kits produced by Aurora Plastics Corporation. Cooper&#x27;s executive assistant, Charles B. FitzSimons, said that these companies should be negotiating through him and Cooper for such licensed products and not RKO. In a letter to Robert Bendick, Cooper stated:

Cooper and his legal team offered up various documents to bolster the case that Cooper owned King Kong and had only licensed the character to RKO for two films, rather than selling him outright. Many people vouched for Cooper&#x27;s claims, including David O. Selznick, who had written a letter to Mr. A. Loewenthal of the Famous Artists Syndicate in Chicago in 1932 stating (in regard to Kong), &quot;The rights of this are owned by Mr. Merian C. Cooper&quot;. Cooper however lost key documents through the years (he discovered these papers were missing after he returned from his World War II military service) such as a key informal yet binding letter from Mr. Ayelsworth (the then-president of the RKO Studio Corp.) and a formal binding letter from Mr. B. B. Kahane (also a
former president of RKO Studio Corp.) confirming that Cooper had only licensed the rights to the character for the two RKO pictures and nothing more.

Without these letters, it seemed Cooper&#x27;s rights were relegated to the Lovelace novelization that he had copyrighted (he was able to make a deal for a Bantam Books paperback reprint and a Gold Key comic adaptation of the novel, but that was &quot;all&quot; that he could do). Cooper&#x27;s lawyer had received a letter from John Beck&#x27;s lawyer, Gordon E. Youngman, that stated:

In a letter addressed to Douglas Burden, Cooper lamented:

The rights over the character did not flare up again until 1975, when Universal Studios and Dino De Laurentiis were fighting over who would be able to do a &quot;King Kong&quot; remake for release the following year. De Laurentiis came up with $200,000 to buy the remake rights from RKO. When Universal got wind of this, they filed a lawsuit against RKO, claiming that they had a verbal agreement from them regarding the remake. During the legal battles that followed, which eventually included RKO countersuing Universal, as well as De Laurentiis filing a lawsuit claiming interference, Colonel Richard Cooper (Merian&#x27;s son and now head of the Cooper estate) jumped into the fray.

During the battles, Universal discovered that the copyright of the Lovelace novelization had expired without renewal, thus making the &quot;King Kong&quot; story a public domain one. Universal argued that they should be able to make a movie based on the novel without infringing on anyone&#x27;s copyright because the characters in the story were in the public domain within the context of the public domain story. Richard Cooper then filed a cross-claim against RKO claiming that, while the publishing rights to the novel had not been renewed, his estate still had control over the plot/story of King Kong.

In a four-day bench trial in Los Angeles, Judge Manuel Real made the final decision and gave his verdict on November 24, 1976, affirming that the &quot;King Kong&quot; novelization and serialization were indeed in the public domain, and Universal could make its movie as long as it did not infringe on original elements in the 1933 RKO film, which had &quot;not&quot; passed into the public domain. Universal postponed their plans to film a King Kong movie, called &quot;The Legend of King Kong&quot;, for at least 18 months, after cutting a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that included a percentage of box office profits from his remake.

However, on December 6, 1976, Judge Real made a subsequent ruling, which held that all the rights in the name, character, and story of King Kong (outside of the original film and its sequel) belonged to Merian C. Cooper&#x27;s estate. This ruling, which became known as the &quot;Cooper judgment&quot;, expressly stated that it would not change the previous ruling that publishing rights of the novel and serialization were in the public domain. It was a huge victory that affirmed the position Merian C. Cooper had maintained for years. Shortly thereafter, Richard Cooper sold all his rights (excluding worldwide book and periodical publishing rights) to Universal in December 1976. In 1980 Judge Real dismissed the claims that were brought forth by RKO and Universal four years earlier and reinstated the Cooper judgement.

In 1982 Universal filed a lawsuit against Nintendo, which had created an impish ape character called Donkey Kong in 1981 and was reaping huge profits over the video game machines. Universal claimed that Nintendo was infringing on its copyright because Donkey Kong was a blatant rip-off of King Kong. During the court battle and subsequent appeal, the courts ruled that Universal did not have exclusive trademark rights to the King Kong character. The courts ruled that trademark was not among the rights Cooper had sold to Universal, indicating that &quot;Cooper plainly did not obtain any trademark rights in his judgment against RKO, since the California district court specifically found that King Kong had no secondary meaning&quot;. While they had a majority of the rights, they did not outright own the King Kong name and character. The courts ruling noted that the name, title, and character of Kong no longer signified a single source of origin so exclusive trademark rights were impossible. The courts also pointed out that the Kong rights were held by three parties:

* RKO owned the rights to the original film and its sequel.
* The Dino De Laurentiis company (DDL) owned the rights to the 1976 remake.
* Richard Cooper owned worldwide book and periodical publishing rights.

The judge then ruled that &quot;Universal thus owns only those rights in the King Kong name and character that RKO, Cooper, or DDL do not own&quot;.

The court of appeals would also note:

Because Universal misrepresented their degree of ownership of King Kong (claiming they had exclusive trademark rights when they knew that they did not) and tried to have it both ways in court regarding the &quot;public domain&quot; claims, the courts ruled that Universal acted in bad faith (see &quot;Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.&quot;). They were ordered to pay fines and all of Nintendo&#x27;s legal costs from the lawsuit. That, along with the fact that the courts ruled that there was simply no likelihood of people confusing Donkey Kong with King Kong, caused Universal to lose the case and the subsequent appeal.

Since the court case, Universal still retains the majority of the character rights. In 1986 they opened a King Kong ride called &quot;King Kong Encounter&quot; at their Universal Studios Tour theme park in Hollywood (which was destroyed in 2008 by a backlot fire), and followed it up with the &quot;Kongfrontation&quot; ride at their Orlando park in 1990 (which was closed down in 2002 due to maintenance issues). They also finally made a King Kong film of their own, &quot;King Kong&quot; (2005). In the summer of 2010, Universal opened a new 3D King Kong ride called &quot;King Kong: 360 3-D&quot; at their Hollywood park, replacing the destroyed &quot;King Kong Encounter&quot;. In July 2016, Universal opened a new King Kong attraction called &quot;Skull Island: Reign of Kong&quot; at Islands of Adventure in Orlando. In July 2013, Legendary Pictures made an agreement with Universal to market, co-finance, and distribute Legendary&#x27;s films for five years starting in 2014 and ending in 2019, the year that Legendary&#x27;s similar agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures was set to expire. One year later, at San Diego Comic-Con, Legendary announced (as a product of its partnership with Universal), a King Kong origin story, initially titled &quot;Skull Island&quot;, with Universal distributing. After the film was retitled &quot;&quot;, Universal allowed Legendary to move to Warner Bros., so they could do a King Kong and Godzilla crossover film (in the continuity of the 2014 &quot;Godzilla&quot; movie), since Legendary still had the rights to make more Godzilla movies with Warner Bros. before their contract with Toho expired in 2020.

Richard Cooper, through the Merian C. Cooper Estate, retained publishing rights for the content that Judge Real had ruled on December 6, 1976. In 1990, they licensed a six-issue comic book adaptation of the novelization of the 1933 film to Monster Comics, and commissioned an illustrated novel in 1994 called &quot;Anthony Browne&#x27;s King Kong&quot;. In 2013, they became involved with a musical stage play based on the story, called &quot;King Kong: The Eighth Wonder of the World&quot; which premiered that June in Australia and then on Broadway in November 2018. The production is involved with Global Creatures, the company behind the &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; arena show. In 1996, artist/writer Joe DeVito partnered with the Merian C. Cooper estate to write and/or illustrate various publications based on Merian C. Cooper&#x27;s King Kong property through his company, DeVito ArtWorks, LLC. Through this partnership, DeVito created the prequel/sequel story &quot;Skull Island&quot; on which DeVito based a pair of original novels relating the origin of King Kong: &quot;Kong: King of Skull Island&quot; and &quot;King Kong of Skull Island&quot;. In addition, the Cooper/DeVito collaboration resulted in an origin-themed comic book miniseries with Boom! Studios, an expanded rewrite of the original Lovelace novelization, &quot;Merian C. Cooper&#x27;s King Kong&quot; (the original novelization&#x27;s publishing rights are still in the public domain), and various crossovers with other franchises such as Doc Savage, Tarzan and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. In 2016, DeVito ArtWorks, through its licensing program, licensed its King Kong property to RocketFizz for use in the marketing of a soft drink called &quot;King Kong Cola&quot;, and had plans for a live action TV show co-produced between MarVista Entertainment and IM Global. Other products that have been produced through this licensing program include Digital Trading Cards, Board Games, a Virtual Reality Arcade Game, a remake of the original King Kong Glow-In-The-Dark Model Kit, and a video game developed by IguanaBee called &quot;Skull Island: Rise of Kong&quot;. In April 2016, Joe DeVito sued Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros., producers of the film &quot;&quot;, for using elements of his Skull Island universe, which he claimed that he created and that the producers had used without his permission. Devito partnered with Dynamite Entertainment to produce comic books and board games based on the property, resulting in the comic book series called &quot;King Kong: The Great War&quot; published in May 2023. In 2022, DeVito had partnered with Disney to produce a live-action series tentatively called &quot;King Kong&quot; that explores the origin story of Kong. The series is slated to stream on Disney+. Stephany Folsom is attached to write the series and to be executive produced by James Wan via his production company Atomic Monster.

RKO (whose rights consisted of only the original film and its sequel) signed over the North American, Latin American and Australian distribution rights to its film library to Ted Turner&#x27;s Turner Entertainment in a period spanning 1986 to 1989. Following a series of mergers and acquisitions, Warner Bros. owns those distribution rights today, with the copyright over the films (including &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;The Son of Kong&quot;) remaining with RKO Pictures, LLC (various companies distribute the RKO library in other territories). In 1998, Warner Bros. Family Entertainment released the direct-to-video animated musical film &quot;The Mighty Kong&quot;, which re-tells the plot of the original 1933 film. Nineteen years later, Warners co-produced the film &quot;&quot; and in 2021 co-produced the film &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;, after Legendary Pictures brought the projects over from Universal to build up the MonsterVerse. According to &quot;Godzilla Vs. Kong&quot; director Adam Wingard, the rights to the character may have also been transferred to Warner Bros.

DDL (whose rights were limited to only their 1976 remake) did a sequel in 1986 called &quot;King Kong Lives&quot; (but they still needed Universal&#x27;s permission to do so). Today most of DDL&#x27;s film library is owned by StudioCanal, which includes the rights to these two films. The domestic (North American) rights to the 1976 &quot;King Kong&quot; film still remain with the film&#x27;s original distributor Paramount Pictures, with Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media handling television rights to the film via their license with Paramount.

=== Toho incarnations ===

In the 1960s, Japanese studio Toho licensed the character from RKO and produced two films that featured the character, &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; (1962) and &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot; (1967). Toho&#x27;s interpretation of King Kong as a &quot;kaiju&quot;, differed greatly from the original in size and abilities. Among &quot;kaiju&quot;, King Kong was suggested to be among the most powerful in terms of raw physical force, possessing strength and durability that rivaled that of Godzilla. As one of the few mammal-based kaiju, Kong&#x27;s most distinctive feature was his intelligence. He demonstrated the ability to learn and adapt to an opponent&#x27;s fighting style, identify and exploit weaknesses in an enemy, and utilize his environment to stage ambushes and traps.

In &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;, Kong was scaled to be tall. This version of Kong was given the ability to harvest electricity as a weapon and draw strength from electrical voltage. In &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot;, Kong was scaled to be tall. This version was more similar to the original, where he relied on strength and intelligence to fight and survive. Rather than residing on Skull Island, Toho&#x27;s version of Kong resided on Faro Island in &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; and on Mondo Island in &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot;.

In 1966, Toho planned to produce &quot;Operation Robinson Crusoe: King Kong vs. Ebirah&quot; as a co-production with Rankin/Bass Productions, but Ishirō Honda was unavailable at the time to direct the film and, as a result, Rankin/Bass backed out of the project, along with the King Kong license. Toho still proceeded with the production, replacing King Kong with Godzilla at the last minute and shot the film as &quot;Ebirah, Horror of the Deep&quot;. Elements of King Kong&#x27;s character remained in the film, reflected in Godzilla&#x27;s uncharacteristic behavior and attraction to the female character Daiyo. Toho and Rankin/Bass later negotiated their differences and co-produced &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot; in 1967, loosely based on Rankin/Bass&#x27; animated show.

Toho Studios wanted to remake &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;, which was the most successful of the entire Godzilla series of films, in 1991 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the film, as well as to celebrate Godzilla&#x27;s upcoming 40th anniversary, but they were unable to obtain the rights to use Kong, and initially intended to use Mechani-Kong as Godzilla&#x27;s next adversary. It was soon learned that even using a mechanical creature who &quot;resembled&quot; Kong would be just as problematic legally and financially for them. As a result, the film became &quot;Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah&quot;, with one last failed attempt made to use Kong in 2004&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

==Appearances==
===Film===
===Television===
Four television shows have been based on King Kong: &quot;The King Kong Show&quot; (1966), &quot;&quot; (2000), &quot;&quot; (2016), and &quot;Skull Island&quot; (2023).

A live-action series based on Joe DeVito&#x27;s &quot;King Kong Of Skull Island&quot; franchise is in development for Disney+, written by Stephany Folsom and executive produced by James Wan via Atomic Monster.

King Kong appeared in episode 27 of the anime show &quot;The New Adventures of Gigantor&quot; titled &quot;King Kong vs Tetsujin (キングコング対鉄人)&quot;. This episode aired April 10 1981, and featured King Kong battling the giant robot hero Gigantor. In the story it turns out it was just a robot disguised as King Kong. To avoid any copyright issue the episode was renamed &quot;The Great Garkonga&quot; when it was dubbed into English. 

The character appears in the final episode of season one of the television series &quot;&quot;.

==Cultural impact==


King Kong, as well as the series of films featuring him, have been featured many times in popular culture outside of the films themselves, in forms ranging from straight copies to parodies and joke references, and in media from comic books to video games.

The Beatles&#x27; 1968 animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; includes a scene of the characters opening a door to reveal King Kong abducting a woman from her bed.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror III&quot; features a segment called &quot;King Homer&quot; which parodies the plot of the original film, with Homer as Kong and Marge in the Ann Darrow role. It ends with King Homer marrying Marge and eating her father.

The 2005 animated film &quot;Chicken Little&quot; features a scene parodying King Kong, as Fish out of Water starts stacking magazines thrown in a pile, eventually becoming a model of the Empire State Building and some plane models, as he imitates King Kong in the iconic scene from the original film.

The British comedy TV series &quot;The Goodies&quot; made an episode called &quot;Kitten Kong&quot;, in which a giant cat called Twinkle roams the streets of London, knocking over the British Telecom Tower.

The controversial World War II Dutch resistance fighter Christiaan Lindemans—eventually arrested on suspicion of having betrayed secrets to the Nazis—was nicknamed &quot;King Kong&quot; due to his being exceptionally tall.

Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention recorded an instrumental about &quot;King Kong&quot; in 1967 and featured it on the album &quot;Uncle Meat&quot;. Zappa went on to make many other versions of the song on albums such as &quot;Make a Jazz Noise Here&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 3&quot;, &quot;Ahead of Their Time&quot;, and &quot;Beat the Boots&quot;.

The Kinks recorded a song called &quot;King Kong&quot; as the B-side to their 1969 &quot;Plastic Man&quot; single.

In 1972, a fiberglass statue of King Kong was erected in Birmingham, England.

The second track of The Jimmy Castor Bunch album &quot;Supersound&quot; from 1975 is titled &quot;King Kong&quot;.

Filk Music artists Ookla the Mok&#x27;s &quot;Song of Kong&quot;, which explores the reasons why King Kong and Godzilla should not be roommates, appears on their 2001 album &quot;Smell No Evil&quot;.

Daniel Johnston wrote and recorded a song called &quot;King Kong&quot; on his fifth self-released music cassette, &quot;Yip/Jump Music&quot; in 1983, rereleased on CD and double LP by Homestead Records in 1988. The song is an a cappella narrative of the original movie&#x27;s story line. Tom Waits recorded a cover version of the song with various sound effects on the 2004 release, &quot;The Late Great Daniel Johnston: Discovered Covered&quot;.

ABBA recorded &quot;King Kong Song&quot; for their 1974 album &quot;Waterloo&quot;. Although later singled out by ABBA songwriters Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus as one of their weakest tracks, it was released as a single in 1977 to coincide with the 1976 film playing in theaters.

Tenacious D wrote &quot;Kong&quot; to be released as a bonus track for the Japanese version of &quot;The Pick of Destiny&quot; to accompany the film.

The 1994 Nintendo Game Boy title &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; features the eponymous character grow to a gargantuan size as the game&#x27;s final boss.

<text>Lay brother is a largely extinct term referring to religious brothers, particularly in the Catholic Church, who focused upon manual service and secular matters, and were distinguished from choir monks or friars in that they did not pray in choir, and from clerics, in that they were not in possession of (or preparing for) holy orders.

In female religious institutes, the equivalent role is the lay sister. Lay brothers were originally created to allow those who were skilled in particular crafts or did not have the required education to study for holy orders to participate in and contribute to the life of a religious order.

==History==
“In early Western monasticism, there was no distinction between lay and choir religious. The majority of St. Benedict&#x27;s monks were not clerics, and all performed manual labour, the word &quot;conversi&quot; being used only to designate those who had received the habit late in life, to distinguish them from the &quot;oblati&quot; and &quot;nutriti&quot;. But, by the beginning of the 11th century, the time devoted to study had greatly increased, thus a larger proportion of the monks were in Holy Orders, even though great numbers of illiterate persons had embraced the religious life. At the same time, it was found necessary to regulate the position of the &quot;famuli&quot;, the hired servants of the monastery, and to include some of these in the monastic family. So in Italy the lay brothers were instituted; and we find similar attempts at organization at the Abbey of St. Benignus at Dijon, under William of Dijon (d. 1031) and Richard of Verdun (d. 1046), while at Hirschau Abbey, Abbot William (d. 1091) gave a special rule to the &quot;fratres barbati&quot; and &quot;exteriores&quot;.”
“At Cluny Abbey the manual work was relegated mostly to paid servants, but the Carthusians, the Cistercians, the Order of Grandmont, and most subsequent religious orders possessed lay Brothers, to whom they committed their secular cares. In particular, at Grandmont, the complete control of the order&#x27;s property by the lay brothers led to serious disturbances, and finally to the ruin of the order; whereas the wiser regulations of the Cistercians provided against this danger and formed the model for the later orders. In England, the Benedictines made but slight use of lay brothers, finding the service of paid attendants more convenient.” Nonetheless, they are “mentioned in the customaries of the Abbey of St. Augustine at Canterbury and the Abbey of St. Peter at Westminster.”

In 1965, the Second Vatican Council issued the document &quot;Perfectae Caritatis&quot;, which called upon all religious institutes to re-examine and renew their charism. As part of the subsequent reforms and experimentation, many of the distinctions between lay and choir religious in terms of dress and spiritual regimen were abolished or mitigated. In many religious institutes, lay and choir religious wear the same habit.

==Life as a lay brother==
Lay brothers were found in many religious orders. Drawn from the working classes, they were pious and hardworking people, who though unable to achieve the education needed to receive holy orders, were still drawn to religious life and were able to contribute to the order through their skills. Some were skilled in artistic handicrafts, others functioned as administrators of the orders&#x27; material assets. In particular, the lay brothers of the Cistercians were skilled in agriculture, and have been credited for the tilling of fertile farmland.

Lay brothers were sometimes distinguished from their brethren by some difference in their habit: for instance, the Cistercian lay brother previously wore a brown tunic, instead of white, with the black scapular; in choir they wore a large cloak, instead of a cowl; the Vallombrosan lay brothers wore a cap instead of a hood, and their habit was shorter; the English Benedictine lay brothers wore a hood of a different shape from that of the choir monks, and no cowl; a Dominican lay brother would wear a black, instead of a white, scapular. In some orders they were required to recite daily the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, but usually their labor in the fields (and hence away from the church) prevented them from participating in the Liturgy of the Hours. Lay brothers would instead pray Paters, Aves, and Glorias.

==Lay sisters==
Lay sisters were found in most of the orders of women, and their origin, like that of the lay brothers, is to be found in the necessity of providing the choir nuns with more time for the Office and study, as well as creating the opportunity for the illiterate to join the religious life. They, too, wore a habit different from those of the choir sisters, and their required daily prayers consisted of prayers such as the Little Office or a certain number of Paters. 

The system of lay sisters seem to have appeared earlier than that of lay brothers, being first recorded in a ninth century hagiography of Saint Denis. In the early medieval period, there was also mention of lay brothers attached to convents of women and of lay sisters attached to monasteries. In both configurations, the two sexes were strictly kept separate, housed in distinct buildings. This arrangement, however, has since been long abolished.

King Kong would go on to feature an ever-changing lineup of performers including John McEntire, David Grubbs, and Peter Townsend.

The song &quot;Movie Star&quot; was used in the end credits of the 2014 Slint documentary, Breadcrumb Trail.

In 2018, King Kong released three singles: &quot;60s Apartment Building Balcony&quot;, &quot;Pawnshopolis&quot;, and &quot;Pigeon Man&quot;. Each one was accompanied with a music video.

On March 8, 2021, Jimmy Fallon included &quot;Old Man On The Bridge&quot; in his &quot;Do Not Play&quot; segment on &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot;

<doc id="1245575" wikidata="Q15850009" url="?curid=1245575" title="Day trip">
<text>A day trip is a visit to a tourist destination or visitor attraction from a person&#x27;s home, hotel, or hostel in the morning, returning to the same lodging in the evening. The day trip is a form of recreational travel and leisure to a location that is close enough to make a round-trip within a day but does not require an overnight stay. The logistics and/or costs of spending nights on the road are worth avoiding. Such travel of using one location as a homebase is popular with budget and active travelers to avoid finding new lodging at each destination. A caregiver may take a day trip from their home to return to their children or pets.

== History ==

In medieval times a destination for such a trip would be religious (to a nearby shrine) or commercial (for example, to a seasonal fair). Later, in England, visits to stately homes by those who regarded themselves middle class became frequent, and it was the tradition to reward the butler or housekeeper with a tip (gratuity) for providing access to their employer&#x27;s home. As such homes were meant for show, it is unlikely that the owning family would object, provided they were not in residence at the time.

The arrival of the railway excursion, often using Day Tripper tickets, in the mid 19th century saw the blossoming of a distinctive day-tripper industry. Trippers also travelled in their thousands by paddlesteamer or steamship to the many piers around Victorian era seaside resorts. The General Slocum excursion was an example.

Cycling became a very popular day-tripper activity, especially amongst urban and suburban workers, from the mid-1880s onwards.

Coach and charabanc outings followed as the internal combustion engine became reliable enough to get the paying customers out and back again. Works outings and church or chapel excursions were extremely popular until the 1970s.

While all of the foregoing still exist, the modern day-tripper experience is usually by motor car as a result of the growth of car ownership. Also, airlines such as (formerly) Palmair promote day trips.

== Statistics ==
In Germany in 2011, day trips were the predominant type of tourism. According to figures from the Hanover Chamber of Industry and Commerce, 2.84 billion day trippers spent an average of 28 euros in total (gross) that year, around 79.5 billion euros and 564 million Day business travelers €14.2 billion. Other surveys also assume an added value of between €20 and €30 per day tourist. The city of Berlin has, on average, calculated an added value of €32.50 per visitor in recent years with 132 million day visitors. The numbers are i. i.e. R. collected by a representative survey in the source area (survey at the place of residence). The reason for a day stay is often to visit local attractions or sights, to visit sports and leisure facilities, museums, cultural events such as musicals, opera/operettas, concerts and theater performances or just to shop in the city&#x27;s shops.

The version generally considered the prime version, the earlier of the two, is unrestored and hangs in the Louvre in Paris. The other, which was restored between 2008 and 2010, hangs in the National Gallery, London. The works are often known as the Louvre &quot;Virgin of the Rocks andLondon &quot;Virgin of the Rocks respectively. The paintings are both nearly 2 metres (over 6 feet) high and are painted in oils. Both were originally painted on wooden panels, but the Louvre version has been transferred to canvas.

Both paintings show the Virgin Mary and child Jesus with the infant John the Baptist and an angel Uriel, in a rocky setting which gives the paintings their usual name. The significant compositional differences are in the gaze and right hand of the angel. There are many minor ways in which the works differ, including the colours, the lighting, the flora, and the way in which sfumato has been used. Although the date of an associated commission is documented, the complete histories of the two paintings are unknown, leading to speculation about which of the two is earlier.

Two further paintings are associated with the commission: side panels each containing an angel playing a musical instrument and completed by associates of Leonardo. These are both in the National Gallery, London.

==The paintings==
===Louvre version===
The &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot; in the Louvre is considered by most art historians to be the earlier of the two and dates from around 1483–1486. Most authorities agree that the work is entirely by Leonardo. It is about 8 cm (3 in) taller than the London version. The first certain record of this picture dates from 1625, when it was in the French royal collection. It is generally accepted that this painting was produced to fulfill a commission of 1483 in Milan. It is hypothesised that this painting was privately sold by Leonardo and that the London version was painted at a later date to fill the commission. There are a number of other theories to explain the existence of two paintings. This painting is regarded as a perfect example of Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;sfumato&quot; technique.

===London version===
A very similar painting in the National Gallery, London, is also ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci, and ascribed a date before 1508. Originally thought to have been partially painted by Leonardo&#x27;s assistants, a close inspection of the painting during the recent restoration between 2008 and 2010 has led the conservators from the National Gallery to conclude that the greater part of the work is by the hand of Leonardo, but debate continues. Parts of the painting, the flowers in particular, indicate the collaboration and have led to speculation that the work is entirely by other hands, possibly Leonardo&#x27;s assistant Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis and perhaps Evangelista.

It was painted for the chapel of the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception, in the church of San Francesco Maggiore in Milan. It was sold by the church, very likely in 1781, and certainly by 1785, when it was bought by Gavin Hamilton, who took it to England. After passing through various collections, it was bought by the National Gallery in 1880.

===Angels===

Two paintings of angels playing musical instruments are believed to have been part of the composition that was set into the altarpiece. These two pictures, now in the National Gallery, London, are thought to have been completed between 1490 and 1495. One, an angel in red, is thought to be the work of Ambrogio de Predis while the angel in green is thought to be the work of a different assistant of Leonardo, perhaps Francesco Napoletano.

==History==
===Chapel of the Immaculate Conception===
The Chapel of the Immaculate Conception was founded prior to 1335 by Beatrice d&#x27;Este, wife of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan. The chapel was attached to the church of San Francesco Grande, Milan.

In 1479 the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception contracted Francesco Zavattari and Giorgio della Chiesa to decorate the vault of the chapel. In 1480 the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception contracted Giacomo del Maino to create a large wooden altarpiece with spaces for paintings and with carvings and decoration, to be placed above the altar of the chapel. Final payment was to be made on August 7, 1482.

===Commission for the painting===
On April 25, 1483, Prior Bartolomeo Scorlione and the Confraternity contracted Leonardo da Vinci, and the brothers Ambrogio and Evangelista de Predis to provide the painted panels for the altarpiece. The contract was not explicit about what each artist was to do. Leonardo was referred to in the contract as &quot;Master&quot;. Ambrogio de Predis was also a painter. It is presumed that Evangelista de Predis was a gilder and assisted in preparing the colours.

The details of the painting, colouring and gilding are set out in the contract. The central panel was to be a painting showing the Virgin Mary and Christ child, with two prophets, probably David and Isaiah, surrounded by angels. Above them was to be a lunette containing a relief panel of God and the Virgin Mary, beneath which was a panel showing the crib. The relief figures were to be brightly painted and gilded. To either side of the central painting were to be painted panels showing four angelic musicians on one side and four singing angels on the other. A number of sculptured relief panels were to depict the life of the Virgin Mary. Details of the colours and the gilding of the major parts were specified in the contract.

The due date of installation was December 8, 1483, the Feast Day of the Immaculate Conception, giving seven months for its completion.
===Payment===
On May 1, 1483, there was an initial payment of 100 Lire. This was followed by payments of 40 Lire per month from July 1483 until February 1485 totalling 800 Lire. A final payment was to be negotiated upon completion and delivery of the work in December 1483.

Between 1490 and 1495, Ambrogio and Leonardo wrote to the Confraternity stating that the centrepiece had cost the whole 800 Lire and they asked for a further 1,200 Lire, according to the contract. The Confraternity offered them only 100 Lire as a result of the petition. Leonardo and Ambrogio then requested Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, to intervene on their behalf. It was suggested that the altarpiece should be assessed by experts and evaluated, for the final payment. The artists also suggested that if an agreement over price could not be met, then they should remove the artwork.

In 1503 Ambrogio again appealed for payment, on his own behalf and that of the heirs of his now deceased brother, Evangelista. On March 9, 1503, Louis XII of France, who had invaded Lombardy in 1499, wrote to the commander of Milan requesting that he intervene on behalf of the artists. On June 23, 1503, the Confraternity set out a deed contesting de Predis&#x27; request for evaluation or return of the painting. On April 27, 1506, an evaluation was made. It was judged that the work was still incomplete. Leonardo was requested to finish it, but he was still absent from Milan.

On August 18, 1508, the painting was delivered and put into place. On August 7, 1507, and October 23, 1508, Ambrogio received two payments totalling 200 Lire. The receipt of this payment is acknowledged in correspondence by Leonardo.

===1524–2011===

====National Gallery painting====
In 1524 and 1576 &quot;The Virgin of the Rocks&quot; in the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception, presumably the London version, was invoked against the plague. In 1576, the altarpiece was removed from the chapel, which was demolished. In mid-1785, Gavin Hamilton, a Scottish painter and dealer, paid 1,582 Lire to purchase the &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot; from Alessandro, Count Cicogna, administrator of the religious body which succeeded the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception. Hamilton&#x27;s heirs sold the painting to Lord Lansdowne, who had amassed considerable debts. After his death in 1805, his son John was forced to sell nearly all of his father&#x27;s collections, and the painting was purchased by the 15th Earl of Suffolk. In 1880, the painting was sold by the 18th Earl of Suffolk to the National Gallery for 9,000 guineas. It was reported at that time to be in a poor state and was attributed by some critics to Leonardo and by others to Bernardino Luini.

In June 2005, the painting was examined by infra-red reflectogram. This imaging revealed a draft of a different painting beneath the visible one. The draft portrays a woman, probably kneeling, with her right hand outstretched and her left on her heart. Some researchers believe that the artist&#x27;s original intention was to paint an adoration of the infant Jesus. In 2021, Oxia Palus–an artificial intelligence company specialised in the reconstruction of lost artwork–used machine learning techniques to reconstruct this pentimento using the entire oeuvre of Leonardeschi paintings. Many other pentimenti are visible under x-ray or infra-red examination.

In 2009/2010 the painting underwent cleaning and conservation work, returning to display in July 2010. The National Gallery, in a preliminary announcement of the results of the work, said that it revealed that the painting was largely, possibly entirely, by Leonardo, and unfinished in parts. The full publication of the findings was released later in 2010.

====Louvre painting====
In 1625 the &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot; now in the Louvre was seen at Fontainebleau by Cassiano dal Pozzo. In 1806, the French restorer Fr Hacquin transferred the Louvre &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot; from its panel onto canvas. For a brief time in 2011–12 it was hung with the London painting as part of an exhibition in the National Gallery on Leonardo&#x27;s activity as painter to the court of Ludovico Sforza.

====Side panels====
The two panels from the completed altarpiece containing figures of angels playing musical instruments were acquired by the National Gallery, London in 1898.

==Subject==

The subject of the two paintings is the adoration of the Christ child by the infant John the Baptist. This subject relates to a non-Biblical event which became part of the medieval tradition of the holy family’s journey into Egypt. The Gospel of Matthew relates that Joseph, the husband of Mary, was warned in a dream that King Herod would attempt to kill the child Jesus, and that he was to take the child and his mother and flee to safety. There are a series of non-Biblical narratives that relate to the journey to Egypt. One of these concerns Jesus’ cousin, John the Baptist, whose family, like that of Jesus, resided in the town of Bethlehem where the Massacre of the Innocents was to take place. According to legend, John was escorted to Egypt by the Archangel Uriel, and met the holy family on the road. The Louvre website refers to the angel in the painting as &quot;Gabriel&quot; (but the description of the painting in the Louvre still refers to Uriel). This accords with the Apocryphal gospel of John the Baptist, which describes his removal from Bethlehem as by Gabriel rather than Uriel and does not mention the meeting on the road to Egypt.

The subject of the Virgin Mary with the Christ child being adored by John the Baptist was common in the art of Renaissance Florence. John the Baptist is the patron saint of Florence and has often been depicted in the art of that city. Those who painted and sculpted the subject of the Mary and child with St John include Fra Filippo Lippi, Raphael, and Michelangelo.

In both paintings the scene is depicted taking place against a background of rock formations. While scenes of the Nativity were sometimes depicted as taking place in a cave, and Kenneth Clark points to the existence of an earlier rocky landscape in an adoration painted for the Medici family by Fra Filippo Lippi, the setting was unprecedented and gave to the paintings their usual name of the &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot;.

==Description==

===Composition===
The two paintings of the &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot; that now belong to the National Gallery, London, and that belonging to the Louvre Museum, Paris, are the same in subject matter and in overall composition, indicating that one is derivative of the other. The two paintings differ in compositional details, in colour, in lighting and in the handling of the paint.

Both paintings show a grouping of four figures, the Virgin Mary, the Christ child, the infant John the Baptist and an angel arranged into a triangular composition within the painting and set against a background of rocks, and a distant landscape of mountains and water. In both paintings, Mary makes the apex of the pyramidal figure group, stretching one hand to include John and raising the other above the head of the Christ child in a blessing. John kneels, gazing towards the Christ child with his hands together in an attitude of prayer. The Christ child sits towards the front of the painting, supported by the angel, and raising his right hand in a sign of Benediction towards the kneeling John.

===Differences===
Compositionally, all the figures are slightly larger in the London painting than in the Louvre painting. The main compositional difference between the two paintings is that while in the London painting the angel&#x27;s right hand rests on his/her knee, in the Louvre painting the hand is raised, the index finger pointing at John. The eyes of the angel are turned down in a contemplative manner in the London painting, but in the Louvre picture are turned to gaze in the general direction of the viewer.

In the London painting, all the forms are more defined, including the bodily forms of the clothed figures. The rocks are painted in meticulous detail, while the forms of the background in the painting in the Louvre are all more hazy. The contrast between light and shade on the figures and faces in the London painting are all much sharper. The faces and forms in the Louvre painting are more delicately painted and subtly blurred by &quot;sfumato&quot;. The lighting in the Louvre painting is softer and appears warmer, but this may be the result of the tone of the varnish on the surface. In keeping with their conservative handling of Leonardo&#x27;s works, the Louvre version has not undergone significant restoration or cleaning. The Louvre painting remains much as it was in 1939 when Kenneth Clark lamented that &quot;We can form no real conception of the colour, the values, or the general tone of the original, buried as it is under layer upon layer of thick yellow varnish. In the darks some mixture of bitumen has made the surface cake and crack like mud, and there are innumerable patches of old repaint all over the picture. All this must be borne in mind before we say that at this date Leonardo was a dark painter and an uninteresting colourist.&quot; 
Another difference is in the colouring of the robes, particularly those of the angel. The London painting contains no red, while in the Louvre painting, the angel is robed in bright red and green, with the robes arranged differently from those of the angel in London. The London version contains traditional attributes missing from the Louvre version, the haloes and John&#x27;s traditional cruciform reed staff. Davies says it is &quot;not certain&quot; if these details which are painted in gold are contemporary with the painting or have been added by a later artist. The details of the flowers are also quite different in the two paintings, with those in the Louvre painting being botanically accurate, and those in the London painting being fanciful creations.

===Angel musicians===

The two paintings of angels that are associated with the &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot; and are in the National Gallery do not properly fulfil the original commission for two panels each showing four angels, singing on one side and playing musical instruments on the other. There are only two musicians, both turned the same direction and both playing musical instruments. One, in green, plays a vielle, and the other, in red, plays a lute. The positions of the feet and the drapery are similar, indicating that the same design has in part been utilised for both. The angel in red is thought to be the work of Ambrogio de Predis. The angel in green is the work of an unknown associate of Leonardo. The National Gallery suggests that it might be the work of Francesco Napoletano.

In both cases the angel is standing in a grey painted niche. A reflectogram of the &quot;Angel in green with a Vielle&quot; revealed part of a painted landscape. The background of the &quot;Angel in red with a Lute&quot; could not be determined because the grey paint on that painting is thick and opaque. While it is commonly thought that the two angel panels were originally placed on either side of the central panel, an article published by the National Gallery suggests that they were placed higher up on the altarpiece.

==Interpretation==

The relationship between the two paintings “remains much debated”. Matters of debate include the dates of the two paintings, their authorship and the nature of their symbolism. For a few months in 2011 and 2012 the two paintings were brought together, possibly for the first time, in the same room in an exhibition at the National Gallery.

===Dates===
It is generally accepted by art historians that the Louvre version is the earlier work. Martin Davies, former director of the National Gallery, described the painting in the Louvre as being stylistically close to Leonardo&#x27;s earlier works and the London painting more suggestive of his maturer style, and therefore the later of the two, and derivative of the Louvre painting. Most authors agree that the Louvre painting was the one that was painted to fulfil the commission of 1483.

Some writers, including Martin Davies, feel that 1483 is too late a date for the Louvre version, and suggest that the painting had already been begun and perhaps completed in Florence before the commission. Wasserman, Ottino della Chiesa and others have pointed out that the measurements of both paintings are compatible with the altarpiece, and that it is an unlikely coincidence that Leonardo painted a picture that fitted the dimensions, at a time prior to the commission. Wasserman suggests that perhaps the Louvre painting was extended to fit the arched shape, and that the joint is no longer visible since the painting was transferred to canvas in the 19th century. Davies suggests that Leonardo painted the second version in the 1480s to fulfil the commission, and based it on the earlier work. Kenneth Clark agrees with this interpretation, placing the Louvre painting prior to 1481 and the London painting from 1483.

The theory that is most commonly used to explain the existence of the two paintings is that Leonardo painted the Louvre &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot; to fulfil the commission, giving it a date of 1483, and that he then sold it to another client, and painted the London version as a replacement. In line with this theory, it is hypothesised that the Louvre painting was sold in the late 1480s, after some haggling over the final payment. The London painting was commenced in perhaps 1486 as a substitution for the &quot;original&quot; Louvre version, and was not ready for installation until 1508, after prolonged disagreement and negotiation. This explanation, which della Chiesa attributes to Venturi and Poggi, has gained wide acceptance, and is the version of events described on both the National Gallery and the Louvre websites. Martin Kemp dates the Louvre painting to 1483–1490 and the London painting to 1495–1508.

Not all authors agree with either the dating or the theory that the Louvre painting was the earlier, was sold, and the London painting done as a substitute. Taylor asserts that the London painting is stylistically the earlier of the two, being more meticulous, in keeping with the product of Leonardo&#x27;s Florentine training, while the Louvre painting has more in common with the &quot;Last Supper&quot; and the &quot;Virgin and Child with St Anne&quot;, including the delicate use of &quot;sfumato&quot;. Taylor argues that the London painting fulfils the requirements of the commission of 1483 in terms of iconography, and that the iconography of the Louvre painting indicates that it was painted for an entirely different clientele, and gives it a date in the 1490s.

===Authorship===

It has always been agreed that the Louvre &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot; is entirely by the hand of Leonardo da Vinci. The &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot; in London has generally been seen as having been designed by Leonardo and executed with the assistants. The Louvre website and various authors suggest that the entire painting is by Ambrogio de Predis, painted under Leonardo&#x27;s supervision between 1485 and 1508, or perhaps largely the work of de Predis, with minor intervention by Leonardo.

Since the recent cleaning, National Gallery curator Luke Syson has stated that the quality which has been revealed indicates that the work is mostly from the hand of Leonardo, and that participation of members of Leonardo&#x27;s workshop was almost certainly less than previously thought.

Geologist Ann C. Pizzorusso argues that there are geological inaccuracies in the London version, unlike the Louvre version, which mean it is unlikely to have come from Leonardo&#x27;s hand. Taylor disputes this, drawing attention to the fact that, at the time of writing, Pizzorusso had plainly not seen the glacial lakes to which she referred, and had mistaken clumps of moss for sandstone boulders.

==Copies and derivations==
One of the earliest known direct copies of the Louvre version is actually an altar cloth called the Paliotto leonardesco (ca 1487–90) housed in the Museo Baroffio, and the other is a painting (ca 1494–8) located in the Cheramy Collection, believed by Carlo Pedretti to be created by Leonardo&#x27;s own hand. In her 1967 book (published in English in 1985) Angela Ottino della Chiesa identifies four paintings derived to some degree from &quot;The Virgin of the Rocks&quot;: the &quot;Holy Family and St. John&quot; by Bernardino Luini in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, the &quot;Thuelin Madonna&quot; by Marco d&#x27;Oggiono in the Thuelin collection in Paris and the &quot;Holy Infants Embracing&quot; by Joos van Cleve in the Capodimonte Museum in Naples. This image was much copied by Flemish artists including Joos van Cleve and Quentin Matsys – there is a small painting in Chatsworth by the latter. There is also a smaller copy of &quot;The Virgin of the Rocks&quot; (oil on wood) possibly by Joos van Cleve or his circle (private collection Berlin).

There is a 16th-century copy in the Royal Collection, given as a birthday present to Queen Victoria in 1847 by her husband Prince Albert.

In popular culture, in 1968 the American TV series &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; based the episode &quot;The Illegal Angel&quot; around the theft of a fictional Leonardo painting titled &quot;The Sorrowful Angel&quot;, which is actually a close-up of the angel&#x27;s face on the right of &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot;. The plot of the episode involves an art forger having to make a copy of &quot;Sorrowful Angel&quot; as part of a plan to trap a criminal by fooling him into thinking he has purchased a genuine Leonardo.

<text>North-West Europe 1944–1945 is a battle honour (more properly known as an honorary distinction) earned by regiments of the British Commonwealth forces during the Second World War that took part in the actions of the northern part of the war&#x27;s Western Front. The battle honour &quot;North-West Europe&quot; is suffixed with the year, or years, in which the awarded unit took part in the action.

It refers to the land campaign starting with the 6th June landings in Normandy and ended with Field Marshal Montgomery taking the German military surrender of all German forces in the Netherlands, Northwest Germany and Denmark on Lüneburg Heath in Northwest Germany. The campaign was conducted by Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, of which the British 21st Army Group was a component, along with the American 12th and 6th Army Groups. Together, the three army groups comprised the Allied effort on the Western Front which at its longest stretched from the North Sea to Switzerland.

The battle honours for the Second World War were not awarded until 1957/58 by which point some units had amalgamated or been disbanded.

<text>Ultimate Elektra is a five-issue comic book limited series, which serves as a follow-up to &quot;Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra&quot;. Both were published by Marvel Comics under the Ultimate Marvel imprint. &quot;Devil&#x27;s Due&quot; is written by Mike Carey, with pencils by Salvador Larroca.

==Plot summary==
The mini-series begins shortly after its predecessor, with Matt Murdock and Elektra Natchios in their freshman year at Columbia University.

Elektra can only stand by as her father makes a deal with his cousins, Paul and Leonder, who are in organized crime, so that he can rebuild the family&#x27;s laundromat. Paul and Leonder hope to launder the money earned from their criminal life, but their book keeper Kenneth Cullen has turned state&#x27;s evidence. Elektra Natchios makes a bargain with her cousins, she will recover the evidence in return for her father&#x27;s financial freedom. She fakes being a call girl so that she can recover the evidence, just in time to see Kenneth Cullen killed by Benjamin Poindexter (Ultimate Bullseye) who was sent by the Kingpin.

==Reception==
The first issue of Ultimate Elektra was ranked 16 in the August 2004 period with pre-order sales of 68,340. This was lower than its prequel with Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra&#x27;s first issues sale of 77,050. The final issue #5 dropped in ranking to 35 with pre-order sales of 40,856.

Zeb Aslam from comixfan.com rated the series 3.5 out of 5. The writing is considered &quot;pretty lackluster and average at best&quot; and that the writer Carey is using an &quot;accepted formula&quot; without taking any risks. The artwork was praised however &quot;some panels the figures appear distorted&quot;.

<text>The Svans (, &quot;Shvanar&quot;; , ) are an ethnic subgroup of the Georgians (Kartvelians) living mostly in Svaneti, a region in northwest Georgia. They speak the Svan language and are mostly bilingual also in Georgian. Both these languages belong to the Kartvelian (South Caucasian) language family. In the pre-1930 Soviet census, the Svans were categorized as a separate ethnic group (). The self-designation of the Svan is Mushüan, which is probably reflected in the ethnonym Misimian of the Classical authors.

==History==

The Svans are usually identified with the &quot;Saani&quot; mentioned by Greek geographer Strabo, who placed them more or less in the area still occupied by the modern-day Svans.

In the Russian Empire and early Soviet Union Mingrelians and Svans had their own census grouping, but were classified under the broader category of Georgian in the 1930s. They are Georgian Orthodox Christians, and were Christianized in the 4th–6th centuries. However, some remnants of pre-Christian beliefs have been maintained. Saint George (known as &quot;Jgëræg&quot; to the locals), a patron saint of Georgia, is the most respected saint. The Svans have retained many of their old traditions, including blood revenge, although this tradition has been declining over time and as law enforcement takes hold. Their families are small, and the husband is the head of his family. The Svan strongly respect the older women in families.

==Language==
Typically bilingual, they use both Georgian and their own, unwritten Svan language. Prior to the 19th century, many Svans were monolingual, only knowing the Svan language.

==Genetics==
The most common Y-chromosomal haplogroup among the Svans is G2a (90%), in the second place is the Y-chromosomal haplogroup R1a (5%), in the third place is the Y-chromosomal haplogroup J2a1 (about 3%). Among mitochondrial haplogroups H (17.9%), K (15.8%), W6 (13%), T (9.24%), U1 (7.61%), X2 (6, 52%), U2 (5.98%) are common haplogroups.

==Famous Svans==

* Temur Babluani (born 1948), film director, script writer, and actor
* Géla Babluani (born 1979), Georgian-French film director
* Mikheil Gelovani (1893–1956), actor who primarily portrayed Stalin

<doc id="1245614" wikidata="Q1754555" url="?curid=1245614" title="Conditional-access module">
<text>A conditional access module (CAM) is an electronic device, usually incorporating a slot for a smart card, which equips an integrated digital television or set-top box with the appropriate hardware facility to view conditional access content that has been encrypted using a conditional access system. They are normally used with direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) services, although digital terrestrial pay TV suppliers also use CAMs. PC Card form factor is used as the Common Interface form of Conditional Access Modules for DVB broadcasts. Major CAM manufacturers are Airmod.tech and SMIT. Airmod, created in 2022, regroup CAM formerly managed by Neotion and SmarDTV.

Some encryption systems for which CAMs are available are Logiways, Nagravision, Viaccess, Mediaguard, Irdeto, KeyFly, Verimatrix, Cryptoworks, Mascom, Safeview, Diablo CAM and Conax. NDS VideoGuard encryption, the preferred choice of Sky Digital can only be externally emulated by a Dragon brand CAM. The NDS CAM that the Sky viewing card ordinarily uses is built into the Sky Digibox and thus not visible. Dragon and Matrix, two popular cams with satellite television enthusiasts are meaning each is capable of handling more than one encryption system. Matrix CAMs can be upgraded via the PC Card port in a laptop personal computer whereas a Dragon cam update is done via separate programmer hardware. Although not officially supported or acknowledged, and programmable modules are a grey market in the pay-TV industry.

The primary purpose of the CAM is to derive control words, which are short-term decryption keys for video. The effectiveness of a CAM depends on the tamper resistance of the hardware; if the hardware is broken, the functionality of the CAM can be emulated, enabling the content to be decrypted by non-subscribers. CAMs are normally removable so that they can be replaced after the hardware security is breached. Replacement of the CAMs in a system is called a card swap-out.

CAM Modules come in two types: &quot;standard&quot;, intended for a single TV consumer, and &quot;professional&quot;, made for an array of televisions connected to a rack of CAMs, like in a hospital or a hotel.

The standard format for a CAM is a PC card which takes a smart card to authenticate, although CAMs with the &#x27;smart card&#x27; burnt into memory, known as Cardless CAM, can be found. With the CI+ 2.0 certification came a new USB dongle form factor. In addition, CAM emulators exist for many systems, either providing an interface to allow the use of more than one type of card, or a card not designed for that receiver.

<text>is a travelogue published in 1611 by Thomas Coryat (sometimes also spelled &quot;Coryate&quot; or &quot;Coriat&quot;) of Odcombe, an English traveller and mild eccentric.

== History ==
The book is an account of a journey undertaken, much of it on foot, in 1608 through France, Italy, Germany, and other European countries. Coryat conceived of the 1,975-mile (3,175 km) voyage to Venice and back in order to write the subsequent travelogue dedicated to Henry, Prince of Wales, at whose court he was regarded as somewhat of a buffoon and jester, rather than the wit and intellectual he considered himself. The extent to which Coryat invited such ridicule in pursuit of patronage and court favour is unclear.

The year 1608, when Coryat made his journey, was a period of relative peace in France following the end of both the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598), and the Franco-Spanish War (1595–1598) in northern France. Coryat&#x27;s anecdotes of how the Spanish took Calais in 1596, and Amiens with a bag of walnuts in 1597, were recent events in 1608.

Among other things, Coryat&#x27;s book introduced the use of the fork to England and, in its support of continental travel, helped to popularize the idea of the Grand Tour that rose in popularity later in the century. The book also included what is likely the earliest English rendering of the legend of William Tell.

The work is particularly important to music historians for giving extraordinary details of the activities of the Venetian School, one of the most famous and progressive contemporary musical movements in Europe. The work includes an elaborate description of the festivities at the church of San Rocco in Venice, with polychoral and instrumental music by Giovanni Gabrieli, Bartolomeo Barbarino, and others.

The book appeared with engravings by William Hole, and the author received a pension.

&quot;Crudities&quot; was only twice reprinted at the time, so the first edition is quite rare today. Later, &quot;modern&quot; facsimiles were put out, in 1776 and 1905, which included the later trip to Persia &amp; India.

==&quot;Commendatory&quot; verses==
A custom of Renaissance humanists was to contribute commendatory verses that would preface the works of their friends. In the case of this book, a playful inversion of this habit led to a poetic collection that firstly refused to take the author seriously; and then took on a life of its own. Prince Henry as Coryat&#x27;s patron controlled the situation; and willy-nilly Coryat had to accept the publication with his book of some crudely or ingeniously false panegyrics from 55 contemporary wits and poets of his acquaintance, including John Donne, Ben Jonson, Inigo Jones, and Thomas Roe. Further, the book was loaded with another work, Henry Peacham&#x27;s &quot;Sights and Exhibitions of England&quot;, complete with a description of a perpetual motion machine by Cornelis Drebbel.

There were poems in seven languages. Donne wrote in an English/French/Italian/Latin/Spanish macaronic language. Peacham&#x27;s was in what he called &quot;Utopian&quot;, which was partly gibberish, and the pseudonymous Glareanus Vadianus (tentatively John Sanford) wrote something close to literary nonsense. The contribution of John Hoskyns is called by Noel Malcolm &quot;the first specimen of full-blown literary English nonsense poetry in the seventeenth century&quot;.

In the same year that the book was published, a pirate version of the verses appeared, published by Thomas Thorpe, under the title &quot;The Odcombian Banquet&quot; (1611).

==Modern analogues==
British travel writer and humourist Tim Moore retraced the steps of Coryat&#x27;s tour of Europe, as recounted in his 2001 book &quot;Continental Drifter&quot;.

<doc id="1245631" wikidata="Q304628" url="?curid=1245631" title="Common Development and Distribution License">
<text>The Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) is a free and open-source software license, produced by Sun Microsystems, based on the Mozilla Public License (MPL). Files licensed under the CDDL can be combined with files licensed under other licenses, whether open source or proprietary. In 2005 the Open Source Initiative approved the license. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) considers it a free software license, but one which is incompatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL).

==Terms==
Derived from the Mozilla Public License 1.1, the CDDL tries to address some of the problems of the MPL. Like the MPL, the CDDL is a weak copyleft license in-between GPL license and BSD/MIT permissive licenses, requiring only source code files under CDDL to remain under CDDL.

Unlike strong copyleft licenses like the GPL, mixing of CDDL licensed source code files with source code files under other licenses is permitted without relicensing. The resulting compiled software product (&quot;binary&quot;) can be licensed and sold under a different license, as long as the source code is still available under CDDL, which should enable more commercial business cases, according to Sun.

Like the MPL the CDDL includes a patent grant to the licensee from all contributors (&quot;patent peace&quot;). However, in section 2.1(d), the patent grant is lost if the code implementing a patented feature is modified.

==History==
The previous software license used by Sun for its open source projects was the Sun Public License (SPL), also derived from the Mozilla Public License. The CDDL license is considered by Sun (now Oracle) to be SPL version 2.

The CDDL was developed by a Sun Microsystems team (among them Solaris kernel engineer Andrew Tucker and Claire Giordano), based on the MPL version 1.1. On December 1, 2004 the CDDL was submitted for approval to the Open Source Initiative and was approved as an open source license in mid January 2005.
The second CDDL proposal, submitted in early January 2005, includes some corrections that prevent the CDDL from being in conflict with European Copyright law and to allow single developers to use the CDDL for their work.

In 2006, in the first draft of the OSI&#x27;s license proliferation committee report, the CDDL is one of nine preferred licenses listed as popular, widely used, or with strong communities.

While the Free Software Foundation (FSF) also considered the CDDL a free software license, they saw some incompatibilities with their GNU General Public License (GPL).

===GPL compatibility===
The question of whether and when both licenses are incompatible sparked debates in the free software domain in 2004 to 2006. For instance, the FSF considered the CDDL incompatible to their GPL license, without going into detail until 2016.

CDDL is one of several Open Source Licenses which are incompatible with GPL.
This characteristic was inherited from the MPL 1.1 (fixed with the MPL 2.0 according to the FSF) and results from a complex interaction of several clauses; the root of the problem being GPL virality, similar to other cases of GPL incompatibility. Some people argue that Sun (or the Sun engineer) as creator of the license made the CDDL intentionally GPL incompatible. According to Danese Cooper one of the reasons for basing the CDDL on the Mozilla license was that the Mozilla license is GPL-incompatible. Cooper stated, at the 6th annual Debian conference, that the engineers who had written the Solaris kernel requested that the license of OpenSolaris be GPL-incompatible.

Simon Phipps (Sun&#x27;s Chief Open Source Officer at the time), who had introduced Cooper as &quot;the one who actually wrote the CDDL&quot;, did not immediately comment, but later in the same video, he says, referring back to the license issue, &quot;I actually disagree with Danese to some degree&quot;, while describing the strong preference among the engineers who wrote the code for a BSD-like license, which was in conflict with Sun&#x27;s preference for something copyleft, and that waiting for legal clearance to release some parts of the code under the then unreleased GNU GPL v3 would have taken several years, and would probably also have involved mass resignations from engineers (unhappy with either the delay, the GPL, or both—this is not clear from the video).

Later, in September 2006, Phipps rejected Cooper&#x27;s assertion in even stronger terms. Similarly, Bryan Cantrill, who was at Sun at that time and involved in the release of CDDL licensed software stated in 2015 that he and his colleagues expected in 2006 the fast emergence of CDDL licensed software into the Linux ecosystem and the CDDL being not an obstacle.

===cdrtools controversy===
The GPL compatibility question was also the source of a controversy behind a partial relicensing of cdrtools to the CDDL which had been previously all GPL. In 2006, the Debian project declared the cdrtools legally undistributable because the build system was licensed under the CDDL.

The author, Jörg Schilling, claimed that smake is an independent project and does not violate the GPLv3. Schilling also argued that even though the GPL requires all scripts required to build the work to be licensed freely, they do not necessarily have to be under the GPL. Thus not causing an incompatibility that violates the license.

He also argued that in &quot;combined works&quot; (in contrast to &quot;derived works&quot;) GPL and CDDL licensed code is compatible.

Red Hat&#x27;s attorneys have prevented cdrtools from being in Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, arguing that Schilling has an &quot;unorthodox&quot; view of copyright law that isn&#x27;t shared by their legal counsel or the Free Software Foundation.

===ZFS in the Linux kernel===
In 2015, the CDDL to GPL compatibility question reemerged when Ubuntu announced inclusion of OpenZFS by default.

In 2016 Ubuntu announced that a legal review resulted in the conclusion that it is legally acceptable to use ZFS as binary kernel module in Linux. (As opposed to building it into the kernel image itself.)

Others followed Ubuntu&#x27;s conclusion, for instance James E. J. Bottomley argued there cannot be &quot;a convincing theory of harm&quot; developed, making it impossible to bring the case to court.

Eben Moglen, co-author of the GPLv3 and founder of the SFLC, argued that while the letter of the GPL might be violated, the spirit of both licenses is unharmed, which would be the relevant aspect in court.

The SFLC mentioned also that a precedent exists with the Andrew File System&#x27;s kernel module, which is not considered a derivative work of the kernel by the kernel developers.

On the other hand, Bradley M. Kuhn and attorney Karen M. Sandler from the Software Freedom Conservancy argued that Ubuntu would violate both licenses, as a binary ZFS module would be a derivative work of the kernel. In April 2016, the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS release included the CDDL-licensed ZFS on Linux.

<doc id="1245635" wikidata="Q155124" url="?curid=1245635" title="Michael Giacchino">
<text>Michael Giacchino ( , ; born October 10, 1967) is an American composer of music for film, television, and video games. He has received many accolades for his work, including an Oscar for &quot;Up&quot; (2009), an Emmy for &quot;Lost&quot; (2004), and three Grammy Awards.

Giacchino is known for his collaborations with directors J. J. Abrams, Brad Bird, Matt Reeves, Pete Docter, Colin Trevorrow, Jon Watts, Gareth Edwards, Drew Goddard, J. A. Bayona, The Wachowskis, Taika Waititi, and Thomas Bezucha. His film scores include several films from the ; &quot;Jurassic World&quot;, Marvel Cinematic Universe, &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot series, eight Pixar Animation Studios films, multiple Disney films, &quot;Rogue One&quot;, &quot;The Batman&quot;; and several other films. He also composed the score for the video game series &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty&quot; and the television series &quot;Alias&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot;, and &quot;Fringe&quot;.

In 2018, he ventured into directing, and in 2022 helmed the Marvel Studios Disney+ special &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot;.

== Early life ==
Giacchino was born in Riverside Township, New Jersey. His father&#x27;s ancestors were Italians, coming from Sicily, and his mother&#x27;s ancestors emigrated from Abruzzo (in central Italy). Giacchino grew up in Edgewater Park Township, New Jersey, and graduated from Holy Cross High School in Delran Township, New Jersey in 1986. He holds dual American and Italian citizenship. His brother Anthony Giacchino is a documentary filmmaker.

Giacchino began combining images and music at age 10, when he began creating stop-motion animation with homemade soundtracks in his basement. While in high school, an art teacher who mentored Giacchino recommended to his parents that he attend the School of Visual Arts in New York City. Giacchino describes visiting the school with his parents thus:

I thought, wow, this is fantastic. They actually have colleges like this? Where I can do the things that I am really interested in doing? That was amazing to me. I loved SVA. I loved the kind of freedom that it provided. It was kind of like this great experiment—okay, you&#x27;re here because you like something. So let&#x27;s see how much you like it. We&#x27;re not going to regulate you too much. We&#x27;re going to see how passionate and driven you are, and how much you want this thing.

Giacchino enrolled at SVA, majoring in film production and minoring in history. During his final year at SVA, his instructor in film publicity announced an unpaid internship was available at Universal Pictures. Giacchino, who was the only one interested, obtained the six-month position, which he filled at night while attending school during the day and working at Macy&#x27;s to pay his rent. He graduated from SVA in 1990 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, after which he took music classes at the Juilliard School, and then at UCLA.

== Career ==
=== Video games ===
When Giacchino&#x27;s internship ended, Universal hired him, giving him a job upon graduation from college. He later moved to Disney, and when Disney relocated to Los Angeles, Giacchino moved with them, working in publicity, while taking night classes in instrumentation and orchestration at UCLA. His work for Disney had him interacting with the various personnel who worked in films, such as the producers who hired composers, so when a job at Disney Interactive opened for a producer, Giacchino obtained the job, thinking he could hire himself to write music for the games he produced.

Giacchino&#x27;s composition work for Disney Interactive during the 16-bit era included the Sega Genesis games &quot;Gargoyles&quot; and &quot;Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow&quot; and the various console versions of &quot;The Lion King&quot;. However his first major composition was for the DreamWorks video game adaptation of the 1997 movie, &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. The video game was one of the first PlayStation (also on Sega Saturn) console titles to be recorded with an original live orchestral score. Giacchino has since continued his relationship with DreamWorks which also included composing the score for the &quot;Small Soldiers&quot; video game in 1998, providing full orchestral scores for many of their popular videogames. He also worked with Pandemic studios to create the theme for &quot;&quot;. Giacchino&#x27;s award-winning compositions covers the first four installments of the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; series (&quot;Medal of Honor&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;, &quot;Allied Assault&quot; and &quot;Frontline&quot;), &quot;Heroes: 2&quot;, and also the scores for several other World War II-related video games like &quot;Secret Weapons Over Normandy&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty: Finest Hour&quot;. Additionally, Giacchino composed themes for &quot;The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer&quot;, and co-wrote the theme of &quot;Black&quot; with composer Chris Tilton. He also composed the score for &quot;Alias&quot;, which was based on the television series of the same name. In 2008 Giacchino wrote music for &quot;Turning Point: Fall of Liberty&quot;. In 2007, he returned to the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; franchise as he composed the music for &quot;Medal of Honor: Airborne&quot;.

=== Film and television ===
Giacchino&#x27;s work on various video games led to his entrance into television.

In 2001, J. J. Abrams, producer of the television series &quot;Alias&quot;, discovered Giacchino through his video game work and asked him to provide the new show&#x27;s soundtrack. The soundtrack featured a mix of full orchestral pieces frequently intermingled with upbeat electronic music, a departure from much of his previous work. Giacchino would go on to provide the score for J. J. Abrams&#x27;s 2004 television series &quot;Lost&quot;, creating an acclaimed score which employed a unique process of using spare pieces of a plane fuselage for percussion parts. The score for &quot;Lost&quot; is also notable for a signature thematic motif: a brass fall-off at the end of certain themes. Just like his counterpart Stu Phillips, he worked with the television show creator Abrams on his shows with his music scores while Abrams supplied the show&#x27;s main themes on certain series such as &quot;Alias&quot;.

In 2004, Giacchino received his first big feature film commission. Brad Bird, director of Pixar&#x27;s &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, asked Giacchino to provide the soundtrack for the film after having heard his work on &quot;Alias&quot;. The upbeat jazz orchestral sound was a departure in style not only for Giacchino but for Pixar, which had previously relied on Randy and Thomas Newman for all of its films. Director Brad Bird had originally sought out John Barry – perhaps best known for his work on the early James Bond films—but Barry was reportedly afraid to repeat the styles of his earlier works.

Giacchino was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2005 for &quot;The Incredibles&quot;: Best Score Soundtrack Album for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media and Best Instrumental Composition.

Like his other counterparts Joel McNeely, J. A. C. Redford and Frank DeVol, Giacchino mostly associated with Disney from early in his career up to most recently, ranging from video games such as &quot;Mickey Mania&quot; and &quot;Gargoyles&quot; to films such as &quot;The Incredibles&quot; and eventually collaborated with Walt Disney Imagineering in creating two new soundtracks for the updated versions of Space Mountain at Disneyland, Space Mountain: Mission 2 at Disneyland Paris, and Space Mountain at Hong Kong Disneyland.

Giacchino also composed scores for the 2005 films &quot;Sky High&quot; and &quot;The Family Stone&quot;, and the television movie &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot;. Additionally, he wrote the music for Joseph Barbera&#x27;s final theatrical Tom and Jerry cartoon &quot;The Karate Guard&quot;, and scored the Abrams-directed 2006 film &quot;&quot;. Giacchino&#x27;s next musical achievement was his Paris-inspired score for the Disney-Pixar film &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, which includes the theme song &quot;Le Festin&quot;, performed by French artist Camille. He received his first Academy Award nomination for this score. He also created the score for Abrams&#x27; 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film.

Giacchino scored the Pixar film &quot;Up&quot; (and its accompanying animated short &quot;Partly Cloudy&quot;), for which he collaborated with director Pete Docter. This marked the first time Giacchino worked with a Pixar director other than Brad Bird. This work gained Giacchino his first Academy Award for Best Original Score: the first-ever win for Pixar in that category. Giacchino notes that he won on the same night as his SVA classmate Joel Harlow won for Best Makeup Oscar for &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Giacchino has continued his collaboration with J. J. Abrams. For the Abrams-produced monster film &quot;Cloverfield&quot;, Giacchino wrote an homage to Japanese monster scores in an overture titled &quot;ROAR!&quot;, which played over the credits, and constituted the only original music for the film. He composed the score for J. J. Abrams&#x27; feature &quot;Super 8&quot; in 2011. He also composed for the pilot of the Abrams-produced American television series &quot;Fringe&quot;, after which Giacchino gave scoring duties to his assistant Chad Seiter, who scored the first half of season one. The task was then passed on to Chris Tilton, who scored the latter half of season one and all subsequent seasons.

In 2016, Giacchino composed the score for the Marvel film &quot;Doctor Strange,&quot; as well as the score for the Disney film &quot;Zootopia&quot;. Giacchino also composed the fanfare for the new Marvel Studios logo, which debuted with &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;. In September 2016, it was announced that Giacchino had been chosen to replace composer Alexandre Desplat as the composer for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; anthology film &quot;Rogue One&quot; after Desplat was unavailable following reshoots. Giacchino then scored four more Marvel films: 2017&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming,&quot; 2019&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home,&quot; 2021&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home,&quot; and 2022&#x27;s &quot;.&quot;

Giacchino returned to Pixar to score &quot;Coco&quot; (2017) and &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; (2018).
He also composed the score for Taika Waititi&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;Jojo Rabbit&quot;. In 2022, Giacchino composed the score for &quot; The Batman&quot;, and the score for the Pixar film &quot;Lightyear&quot;.

In 2018, Giacchino wrote, directed and scored Monster Challenge. The short film is a satirical take on Japanese game shows, starring Patton Oswalt, Ben Schwartz, Dermot Mulroney, Amy Brenneman, Benedict Wong, Tom Everett Scott, Taishi Mizuno, Ann Madox, and Teruko Nakajima. Monster Challenge originally premiered at Fantastic Fest in 2018 and premiered on YouTube on March 20, 2020. He continued with his directorial efforts with a &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot; episode &quot;Ephraim and Dot&quot; in 2019.

On March 7, 2022, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Giacchino was directing an upcoming as-of-yet untitled Marvel Studios television project for Disney+. Four days later, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; revealed that he would be directing &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot;, which was released on October 7, 2022.

=== Additional compositions ===
In addition to his long list of soundtracks, in 2005 Giacchino collaborated with Walt Disney Imagineering in creating two new soundtracks for the updated versions of Space Mountain at Disneyland, Space Mountain: Mission 2 at Disneyland Paris, and Space Mountain at Hong Kong Disneyland. Giacchino was also contracted by Sarah Vowell, who played character Violet in &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, to compose the score to the audio version of her book &quot;Assassination Vacation&quot;. Michael Giacchino&#x27;s music can also be heard in &quot;Star Tours: The Adventure Continues&quot; during the &quot;travel log videos&quot; shown in the queue for both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World versions of the attraction.

In 2009, he was asked to conduct the Academy Awards orchestra for the 81st Academy Awards. For this project he rearranged many famous movie themes in different styles, including a 1930s Big Band treatment of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and a bossa nova of &quot;Moon River&quot;. Giacchino also composed the fanfare for the 100th Anniversary logo of Paramount Pictures, which debuted with &quot;&quot; on December 7, 2011, at the Dubai International Film Festival, which it carried onto the logos of Paramount&#x27;s other divisions, as well as the new fanfare for Marvel Studios, which debuted alongside its logo with &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; on October 13, 2016, in Hong Kong, in which he also composed an arrangement of the theme song of the 1967 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; cartoon series, in &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;, replacing his work on the fanfare of the Marvel Studios logo for that film, and he rearranged the fanfare in &quot;&quot; to make a more rock style, and &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot;, in which he directed the special. On top of that, he also composed the fanfare for the Marvel Studios Special Presentation and Marvel Spotlight logos, which debuted in &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot;, respectively.

=== Acting ===
In 2015, Giacchino played an It&#x27;s a Small World operator in the film &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; which he scored. Additionally, the same year, he played First Order Stormtrooper FN-3181 in J. J. Abrams&#x27; &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;. He reprised the role in the 2018 animated film &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;. In 2019, he cameoed as a Sith trooper in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, also directed by Abrams.

=== Directing ===
Giacchino grew up with an immense love for filmmaking, often spending time making short films in his youth. He made his professional directorial debut in 2019 with an episode of &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot; during its second season. In 2020, Giacchino directed in his own short film, &quot;Monster Challenge&quot; starring Patton Oswalt. In 2022, Giacchino directed and scored the Marvel Studios Halloween special &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; to critical acclaim. In January 2023, it was announced that Giacchino would make his feature directorial debut with a remake of &quot;Them!&quot; for Warner Bros. Pictures. He is expected to score the film as well.

== Style ==

Giacchino is noted for using humorous titles filled with puns on his soundtrack albums. &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;Jurassic World&quot; in particular had many ape- and dinosaur-related double entendres such as &quot;Gorilla Warfare&quot; and &quot;Raptor Your Heart Out&quot;. Many of those have references to previous works of his, both in style and naming. Giacchino used themes from the track &quot;U-Boat&quot; from the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; soundtrack in the tracks &quot;Sawyer Jones and the Temple of Boom&quot; and &quot;Sub-Primed&quot; from the 5th and 6th season &quot;Lost&quot; soundtracks as the submarine motif. In terms of naming, the score for &quot;The Incredibles&quot; contains a piece named &quot;100 Mile Dash&quot;, and subsequently &quot;Ratatouille&quot; had &quot;100 Rat Dash&quot;, &quot;Up&quot; had &quot;Three Dog Dash&quot;, and &quot;Coco&quot; had &quot;Shrine and Dash&quot;. Another series of examples: &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Beach Party&quot; from the first &quot;Lost&quot; album, &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Last 4 Minutes To Live&quot; from the &quot;&quot; soundtrack, &quot;Galaxy&#x27;s Worst Sushi Bar&quot; from &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2010 deluxe release), &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Landscaping&quot; from the second &quot;Lost&quot; album, &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Car Wash&quot; from the soundtrack album &quot;Lost: The Final Season&quot;, and &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Field Trip&quot; from the soundtrack of &quot;Super 8&quot;. The soundtrack for &quot;&quot; also has a track titled &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Parking Valet&quot;, and the score for &quot;Zootopia&quot; contains a track titled &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Animal Shelter&quot; as well as the score for &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; including a track called &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Babysitters&quot;. Inversely, the score for &quot;&quot; has a track titled &quot;World&#x27;s Best Carpool Lane&quot;; the &quot;Speed Racer&quot; score has tracks titled &quot;World&#x27;s Best Autopia&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Road Rage&quot;; the soundtrack for &quot;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom&quot; has a track titled &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Bedtime Storyteller&quot;; the soundtrack for &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; has a track titled &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Shop Keepers&quot;; the &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; score has a track titled &quot;Astral World&#x27;s Worst Killer&quot;; the &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot; score has an alternate title for &quot;Cargo Shuttle SW-0608&quot; which is &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Vacation Destination&quot;; the &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; score has a track titled &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Water Feature&quot;; the &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; score has a track titled &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Friendly Neighbor&quot;; &quot;The Batman&quot; score has a track entitled &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Translator&quot;; the &quot;Lightyear&quot; score has a track entitled &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Self-Destruct Sequence&quot;.

Notably - this tradition of pun names was omitted from the soundtrack of &quot;Society of the Snow&quot;, likely out of respect for the victims of the disaster.

<text>Pinus cembroides, also known as pinyon pine, Mexican pinyon, Mexican nut pine, and Mexican stone pine, is a pine in the pinyon pine group.

It is a small pine growing to about with a trunk diameter of up to . It is native to western North America. It grows in areas with low levels of rainfall and its range extends southwards from Arizona, Texas and New Mexico in the United States into Mexico. It typically grows at altitudes between .

The seeds are large and form part of the diet of the Mexican jay and Abert&#x27;s squirrel. They are also collected for human consumption, being the most widely used pine nut in Mexico.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus cembroides&quot; is a small to medium-size tree, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to . The bark is dark brown, thick and deeply fissured at the base of the trunk. The leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in mixed pairs and threes, slender, to long, and dull yellowish green, with stomata on both inner and outer surfaces.

The cones are globose, to long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-brown when 18–20 months old, with only a small number of thick scales, with typically 5-12 fertile scales. The cones open to to broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening. The seeds are to long, with a thick shell, a pink endosperm, and a vestigial wing.

==Taxonomy==
Mexican pinyon was the first pinyon pine described, named by Zuccarini in 1832. Many of the other pinyon pines have been treated as varieties or subspecies of it at one time or another in the past, but research in the last 10–50 years has shown that most are distinct species. Some botanists still include Johann&#x27;s pinyon and Orizaba pinyon in Mexican pinyon; the former accounts for records of &quot;Mexican pinyon&quot; in southern Arizona and New Mexico.

Mexican pinyon is a relatively non-variable species, with constant morphology over the entire range except for the disjunct population in the Sierra de la Laguna pine-oak forests of Baja California Sur; this is generally treated as a subspecies, &quot;Pinus cembroides&quot; subsp. &quot;lagunae&quot;, although some botanists treat it as a separate species, &quot;P. lagunae.&quot; This subspecies differs from the type in having slightly longer leaves, between and and longer, narrower cones, up to long.

==Distribution and habitat==
The range extends from westernmost Texas, United States (where it is restricted to the Chisos and Davis Mountains), south through much of Mexico, occurring widely along the Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental ranges, and more rarely in the eastern Eje Volcánico Transversal range. It lives in areas with little rainfall, which fluctuates between .

The subspecies &quot;Pinus orizabensis&quot; (orizabensis) is found farther south in the state of Veracruz. There is also a disjunct population in the Sierra de la Laguna of southern Baja California Sur. It occurs at moderate altitudes, mostly from , which some authorities consider a separate species (&quot;P. lagunae&quot;).

==Ecology==
The seeds are dispersed by the Mexican jay, which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a major food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees. Abert&#x27;s squirrel also feeds on the seeds in preference to those of the ponderosa pine.

==Conservation==
It is a common pine with a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Uses==
The seeds are widely collected in Mexico, being the main edible pine nut in the region. While palatable when raw, their flavor is considered to be improved when roasted.

<doc id="1245644" wikidata="Q5325630" url="?curid=1245644" title="Ear X-tacy">
<text>ear X-tacy was a Louisville, Kentucky &quot;alternative record store,&quot; owned and operated by John Timmons. The store announced its closing on October 31, 2011, after 26 years in business.

==History==
ear X-tacy first opened in 1985 in a 500 ft2 (46 m2) building stocked with John Timmons&#x27; personal records &quot;and a cash advance on his MasterCard.&quot; The store name came from the band XTC, of which owner John Timmons is a fan. As the store grew, it changed location three times over a period of sixteen years; it then remained in the same location, in a former bathroom fixtures showroom on Bardstown Road just south of Eastern Parkway in The Highlands, until late July 2010. It then moved to the Douglass Loop, a former streetcar turnaround point on Bardstown Road about southeast of its previous location but still in The Highlands.

ear X-tacy carried a wide variety of CDs, cassettes, and vinyl records, and also carried a large stock of DVDs, including many hard-to-find items. In 1995, Timmons launched the ear X-tacy record label, which released records by Louisville-based musicians such as Tim Krekel.

Due to financial issues, ear X-tacy moved for the final time to a smaller location in 2010, just south of where their previous location was on Bardstown Road. However, the financial issues continued and ear X-tacy owner John Timmons made the decision to permanently close. ear X-tacy officially closed on October 31, 2011, but due to the amount of unsold inventory still remaining after the close, the store held a liquidation sale in December 2011 before officially closing for good.

ear X-tacy also operated a second location in the Eastgate Shopping Center in Middletown from 1992 through 1998.

The store&#x27;s signature white-on-black logo stickers spawned a local fad wherein people cut up and reassembled the distinctive letters to form other words or phrases, such as &quot;racy aXe&quot; or &quot;area X.&quot;

A documentary on ear X-tacy was released in 2012 under the title &quot;Brick and Mortar and Love.&quot;

<doc id="1245647" wikidata="Q16373659" url="?curid=1245647" title="Odishi">
<text>Odishi () was a historical district in western Georgia, the core fiefdom of the former Principality of Mingrelia, with which the name &quot;Odishi&quot; was frequently coterminous. Since the early 19th century, this toponym has been supplanted by Mingrelia (Samegrelo).

== Geography ==

Like most historical regions of Georgia, Odishi had fluctuating borders. It was bounded by the Black Sea to the west and the Tskhenistsqali river to the east; to the northwest, Odishi bordered and at times expanded into Abkhazia; to the north were the mountains of Takveri, that is, the letter-day Lechkhumi, and Svaneti; and the Rioni river formed the border between Odishi and Guria to the south. In its narrower sense, Odishi referred to a tract of land between the Inguri and Tekhuri rivers, bathed by the Black Sea. The chief town and largest settlement was Zugdidi. Chqondidi at Martvili served as the principal Christian cathedral. A Georgian demonym for the people of Odishi was &quot;odishari&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of Odishi is not clear. According to Georgy Klimov, in Mingrelian the term Odishi breaks down as Od-ish-i, where od- goes back to Proto-Kartvelian *ad- (yellow azalea) and -ish- is a topoformative element. There also is an explanation of this name in Laz, Odi-shi (Odişi) meaning &quot;From Odi&quot;. The early-18th-century Georgian scholar Prince Vakhushti, who included a detailed geographical account of the region in his &quot;Description of the Kingdom of Georgia&quot;, suggested a folk etymology of Odishi as meaning &quot;once [&quot;odeshi&quot;] this land was ours.&quot; A modern hypothesis relates Odishi to a pagan deity from the Mingrelian folklore, named Odi. The name of Odishi survives in those of a plateau in western Georgia, a village in the Zugdidi Municipality, and a broadcasting company based in Zugdidi.

== History ==
Odishi first appears in the &quot;Georgian Chronicles&quot; under the reign of Queen Tamar (r. 1184–1213) as a fief ruled by the &quot;eristavi&quot; (&quot;duke&quot;) of the dynasty with gentilitial titles of &quot;Bediani&quot; and &quot;Dadiani&quot;, derived from the respective localities. The dynasty, henceforth surnamed Dadiani, acceded to the rank of sovereign princes after the dissolution of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 1490s. Natively, and in the early modern Georgian historical literature, Odishi was the name of both the district and the whole Dadiani-ruled principality. The latter came to be known to the Europeans as Mingrelia after the principal group of people inhabiting it, but they were also familiar with Odishi as the name of one of the two principal subdivisions of the Principality of Mingrelia, the other being Lechkhumi. The Georgian equivalent of Mingrelia, Samegrelo, although referenced in much earlier records, did not enter the common usage until after the imposition of the Imperial Russian hegemony in 1804. The Mingrelian signatory to the 1804 treaty with Russia, Prince Grigol Dadiani, referred to himself as the &quot;lawful Lord of Odishi, Lechkhumi, Svaneti, Abkhazia, and all the lands anciently belonging to the ancestors of mine.&quot;

<text>Sweden has three metropolitan areas consisting of the areas surrounding the three largest cities, Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö. The statistics have been retrieved from Statistics Sweden and the statistics released on 10 November 2014. The official land areas for each municipality have also been retrieved from Statistics Sweden, the agency that defines these areas.
==Population centers==
, Sweden had 2 metropolitan areas with a population of over 1,000,000 people each.

The following table shows the populations of the top ten metropolitan areas.

==Metropolitan Stockholm==
Metropolitan Stockholm (also known as Greater Stockholm or, in Swedish, &quot;Storstockholm&quot;), is a metropolitan area surrounding the Swedish capital of Stockholm. Since 2005, Metropolitan Stockholm is defined by official Swedish Statistics as all of Stockholm County. It is the largest of the three metropolitan areas in Sweden.

Metropolitan Stockholm is divided into 5 areas: Stockholm City Centre, Söderort, Västerort of Stockholm Municipality; and the northern suburbs and southern suburbs, which consists of several municipalities.


==Metropolitan Gothenburg==
Metropolitan Gothenburg (&quot;Storgöteborg&quot; or literally Greater Gothenburg), is a metropolitan area surrounding the city of Gothenburg in Sweden. The metropolitan region is located in Västra Götaland County, except for the municipality of Kungsbacka, which is located to the south in Halland County. As of 2005, the municipalities of Alingsås and Lilla Edet were added to the region. The region is often used for statistical measures, and estimates in the 1960s predicted that the region would have about one million inhabitants in the year 2000. The region is the second largest metropolitan area in Sweden after Metropolitan Stockholm.


==Metropolitan Malmö==

Greater Malmö (&quot;Stormalmö&quot;), also known as Metropolitan Malmö is the metropolitan area of Malmö in Sweden. The area is located in Southwestern Scania (&quot;Sydvästra Skåne&quot;), which is often considered synonymous with Greater Malmö, and it is part of the wider transnational Öresund Region. Besides Malmö, large towns in Greater Malmö includes Lund and Trelleborg, the former of which was the seat of the historical Catholic Archdiocese of Lund.

Since the 1970s, improvements in highways and the regional and InterRegio train networks means the commuting area has grown to include Ystad, Skurup, Sjöbo, Eslöv, Höör, Landskrona and Helsingborg, though only some of these are included in official definitions of Greater Malmö. It&#x27;s not uncommon to live in Malmö and work either in Ystad or Helsingborg, or vice versa, but these towns have kept their mental allegiance with older divisions of Scania. Commuting across the Öresund has become more common, both through the Øresund Bridge and the HH Ferry route, at which car ferries departs every 12 minutes in summer (every 15 minutes in winter).

Statistics Sweden, which sets the official definitions for all metropolitan areas in Sweden, has changed which municipalities are included in Greater Malmö over time. The most recent change to the definition came in 2006, when Eslöv, Höör, and Skurup Municipalities became part of Greater Malmö, bringing the number of municipalities included from 9 to 12.

<text>Robert Angus Smith FRS (15 February 1817 – 12 May 1884), commonly referred to as Angus Smith, was a Scottish chemist, who investigated numerous environmental issues. He is known for his research on air pollution in 1852, in the course of which he discovered what came to be known as &quot;acid rain&quot;. He is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Father of Acid Rain&#x27;.

==Education and early life==

Born at Pollokshaws, Glasgow, Smith was educated at the University of Glasgow in preparation for ministry in the Church of Scotland but left before graduating. He worked as a personal tutor and, accompanying a family to Gießen in 1839, he stayed on in Germany to study chemistry supervised by Justus von Liebig, earning a PhD in 1841.

==Career and research==
On returning to England the same year, he again considered Holy Orders but instead was attracted to Manchester to join the chemical laboratory of Lyon Playfair at the Royal Manchester Institution. Here he became involved in some of the environmental issues of the world&#x27;s first industrial city (see &quot;History of Manchester&quot;). Playfair left for greener pastures in 1845 and Smith worked at making a living as an independent analytical chemist. After some initial alarming experiences, Smith refused to take on expert witness work which was a staple of consulting scientists of the day and which he saw as corrupt. Consequently, when the Alkali Inspectorate was established by the Alkali Act 1863, Smith&#x27;s integrity made him the natural candidate. As Queen Victoria&#x27;s Inspector of Alkali Works, he was the prototype of the scientific civil servant. He held the post until his death. He is buried in the graveyard of St Paul&#x27;s Church on Kersal Moor, Salford

In 1872 Smith published the book &quot;Air and Rain: The Beginnings of a Chemical Climatology&quot;, which presents his studies of the chemistry of atmospheric precipitation. These studies include the discovery, in 1852, of acid rain in northern British cities, a consequence of the burning of coal rich in sulfur. He was conferred with Honorary Membership of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland in 1884. After his death his collection of about 4,000 books was acquired by the library of Owens College, Manchester. They are now in the John Rylands University Library, the successor of the college library.

==Spiritualism==

Smith with his friend William Crookes, attended a séance on 21 April 1870 in London. He sent Crookes 15 letters on spiritualism between April 1869 and 1871. Smith did not choose to write widely about spiritualism as he believed it might damage his scientific reputation. He was a member of the Society for Psychical Research from 1882 to 1884. After he died, 89 books on the occult were discovered in his library.

==Awards and honours==
Smith was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1857.

<text>Joel Garten (born 1981) is a pianist and improviser known for his innovative improvisations. His music is influenced by classical music and jazz, but mostly by modern composers such as Morton Feldman, jazz improviser Keith Jarrett and modern artists such as Jackson Pollock and Clyfford Still. Most of his piano works are entirely improvisational and reflect a remarkably personal connection to his music. His work is noted by critics as being deeply reflective and heartfelt. There are those who also draw comparisons to the music of Cecil Taylor. Joel Garten has created a number of innovative works for prepared piano using paint brushes and other hardware on the strings of the piano.

He studied experimental music under the tutelage of Toronto composer Martin Arnold. Garten&#x27;s music was first produced by Jaymz Bee, a popular music producer and radio personality on JAZZ.FM91. He has performed in a number of cities in North America, as well as in the Registan in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. He was also invited by rock musician Bryan Adams to perform at his studio The Warehouse, where Garten performed an hour-long concert of his solo piano improvisations in 1999. Garten was also commissioned to write a work for Toronto&#x27;s 200th birthday which he performed at Toronto&#x27;s Casa Loma.

Garten was a curator in 2006 at an exhibit in the Echigo Tsumari Triennial in Japan, the largest international art exhibit in Japan. In addition to his art curation at the Triennial, he wrote compositions that were inspired by his study of local folk music, which he performed in a solo piano concert in Hachi, Japan. He later performed these works in another solo piano concert at the Japan Foundation, Toronto. Garten performed an hour-long solo piano improvised concert at the Tenri Cultural Institute in 2010. He was also a member of the Board of Directors of The Music Gallery, one of Toronto&#x27;s premier New Music performance venues.

&quot;Joel’s multi-layered music sweeps you away. He paints rich and mysterious mental landscapes and magically creates awesome sculptural shapes in your mind’s eye that continually transform and mesmerize... This is like NOTHING you’ve ever heard!&quot; - Jeanne Beker, Fashion Television

<doc id="1245665" wikidata="Q7801341" url="?curid=1245665" title="Tiger! Tiger! (Kipling short story)">
<text>&quot;Tiger! Tiger!&quot; is a short story by Rudyard Kipling. A direct sequel to &quot;Mowgli&#x27;s Brothers&quot;, it was published in magazines in 1893–94 before appearing as the third story in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1894), following &quot;Kaa&#x27;s Hunting&quot;. The title is derived from William Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;The Tyger&quot;.

The story focuses on Mowgli&#x27;s alienation from wolf and human society, which both reject him.

==Story==
After driving out the tiger Shere Khan, Mowgli leaves the wolf pack that has raised him and makes his way to a human village to be with his own (biological) kind. There he is adopted by a bereaved couple, Messua and her husband, due to his resemblance to their long-lost son Nathoo. The village priest agrees to this because it will keep Messua&#x27;s rich husband happy.

For three months Mowgli learns human language and customs such as wearing clothes, ploughing, money and caste divisions, few of which impress him. He is also disrespectful to the village elders when they tell fanciful tales of the jungle, such as claims of the tiger being the reincarnation of a lame money-lender, since he has first-hand experience of what the jungle is really like. What is not fanciful is the 100-rupee reward for the tiger&#x27;s skin.

During this period, Mowgli regularly sneaks out of the village to meet his wolf friend Grey Brother who brings him news of the jungle.

To keep Mowgli out of trouble the village elders decide to put him to work herding buffalo. One day while taking a break from this task he meets Grey Brother again. The wolf tells him that Shere Khan has returned and is planning to kill Mowgli.

For the next few weeks Grey Brother keeps watch on Shere Khan while Mowgli goes about his tasks in the village. Eventually he meets Mowgli again and tells him that Shere Khan is hiding in a nearby ravine in preparation to attack. Mowgli learns that Grey Brother obtained this information from Shere Khan&#x27;s accomplice Tabaqui the jackal, before killing him.

With the aid of Akela, Mowgli and Grey Brother divide the buffalo herd in two and stampede them from opposite ends of the ravine, trampling the tiger to death between them.

Mowgli, who has promised to lay Shere Khan&#x27;s skin on the wolf pack&#x27;s Council Rock, sets about skinning the tiger. The village hunter Buldeo has been told of the stampede by the other village boys, and soon arrives to chastise Mowgli. Buldeo demands that Mowgli hand the skin over to him for the reward. Mowgli refuses, and summons Akela to restrain him.

When Mowgli and Akela let him go, the frightened hunter returns to the village and tells the villagers Mowgli is a shapeshifting sorcerer. By the time the unsuspecting Mowgli returns with the buffalo, the entire village except Messua has turned against him and they drive him away.

Confused and disgusted by their behaviour, Mowgli fulfils his promise to lay out Shere Khan&#x27;s hide on Council Rock and dances upon it, singing of his emotional confusion. The pack offers to take Mowgli back, but he refuses to forgive them for casting him out earlier. Instead he decides that from now on he will hunt alone, except for his four wolf-brothers who refuse to be parted from him. The story ends with the statement that Mowgli will eventually grow up and get married, &quot;but that is a story for grown-ups&quot;. This is clearly a reference to Kipling&#x27;s earlier story &quot;In the Rukh&quot; (collected in &quot;Many Inventions&quot;), which was indeed aimed at adults, in which the adult Mowgli does marry.
