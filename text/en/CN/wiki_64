<text>Annaba (,  &quot;Place of the Jujubes&quot;), formerly known as Bon, Bona and Bône, is a seaport city in the northeastern corner of Algeria, close to the border with Tunisia. Annaba is near the small Seybouse River and is in the Annaba Province. With a population of about 263,650 (2019) and 1,000,000 for the metropolitan area, Annaba is the third-largest city and the leading industrial center in Algeria.

Annaba is a coastal city that underwent significant growth during the 20th century. Annaba has a metropolitan area with a higher population density than the other metropolitan areas of the Algerian coastline, such as Oran and Algiers. Much of eastern and southern Algeria uses the services, equipment and infrastructure of Annaba. Economically, it is the centre for various economic activities, such as industry, transportation, finance, and tourism.
==Names==
Present-day Annaba grew up on the site of Aphrodisium, the seaport of the Roman city . (The modern city has since expanded south over Hippo&#x27;s ruins as well.) Its former names Bône and Bona derived from &quot;Ubbo&quot;, a local form of the name Hippo. Its informal name &quot;Land of the Jujubes&quot; (, &quot;Balad al-‘Unnāb&quot;) derives from that abundance of that fruit in the region.

==History==

=== Ancient ===
The area of Annaba has yielded evidence of very early human occupation at Ain el Hanech, near Saïda (circa 200,000 BC), including artifacts that show remarkable toolmaking craftsmanship. According to some sources, prehistoric Algeria was the site of the most advanced development of flake-tool techniques in the Middle Early Stone Age (Middle Paleolithic).

The town of Hippo Regius (modern Annaba) first entered historical records at the end of the 3rd century BCE as a possession of Massinissa&#x27;s Numidian Kingdom. Augustine of Hippo was bishop here from 396 AD until his death in 430 AD. The city was destroyed in the 5th century by the Vandals. Vandals ruled the city for roughly a century until 534. Gelimer, the King of the Vandals and Alans from 530 to 534 AD, faced with the starvation of his followers and their children, and realizing he had no chance of regaining his kingdom of North Africa, surrendered to Flavius Belisarius, a general of the Byzantine Empire under Justinian I, at Bône. Byzantines then ruled Hippona (Hippo&#x27;s renamed name after 395) before the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in 699 AD. Later, Abbasids, Aghlabids, and Fatimids ruled Bona before the rise of the Zirids. It was relocated to its present place after flooding and Banu Hilal the ravages that occurred in 1033 during Hammadid rule. It was attacked by a Pisan fleet in 1034 and was conquered by Kingdom of Sicily in 1153. The Almohads took it in 1160.

During the 11th century, the Banu Hilal, an Arab tribe living between the Nile and the Red Sea, settled in Tunisia, Tripolitania (western Libya) and Constantinois (eastern Algeria) which was the portion known as Annaba.

After the demise of the Almohads, the rule of the Hafsids began in Annaba in 1250. Hafsid rule was interrupted by brief occupations of the Marinids and Castile (in 1360) and ended with that of the Zayyanids. Rule by the Ottoman Empire began in 1533, and that lasted until French occupation in 1832, excepting rule by the Spanish Empire between 1535 and 1540. The Barbary pirates also lived in Annaba from the 16th through 19th centuries.

=== Modern ===
During the rule of France (empire and republics), this city was called Bône. It was one of the main French settlements, and it still has a sizeable minority of the &quot;Pied-Noir&quot;. One notable pied-noir from Bône was General Alphonse Juin, a Marshal of France and then the Central European NATO Commander.

Construction was undertaken at Bône during 1856–69 to build an sheltered port to handle the iron ore from the Mokta el Hadid.
A short railroad line was built from the iron ore mine at Ain Mokra to the docks of Bône. This railway was opened in 1864, the first one to be built in Algeria. Full-scale production or iron ore began in 1865. Also in 1865, Emperor Napoleon III visited Algeria, including going to the mine and the city of Bône.

In 1865, the mine produced 22,000 tonnes of iron ore, which increased to 255,000 tonnes in 1869. The ore was extracted from underground galleries, and then shipped from Bône to the French iron and steel works. Before the mine was opened, Bône had just 10,000 inhabitants. By 1924, there were 41,000 people, and the port was being used to export phosphates, lead ore, and zinc ore, too.

During World War II in 1943, Bône was an important goal of the U.S. Army and British Army in Operation Torch, advancing eastward from Morocco, Oran, and Algiers across North Africa. Bône was a crucial highway and sea location for the invasion of Tunisia, and thence the driving of the Axis Powers (Germany and Italy) out of Africa in May 1943.

Bône remained in Allied hands until the end of the war in 1945, and then it remained a part of French Algeria until the independence of Algeria in 1962.

==Demography==

The city of Annaba had a population of 257,359 in 2008 (General Census of the population and habitat). In 1988, the population of the urban district of Annaba had increased to 359,657 (with El Bouni comprising 111,956 inhabitants). The cities of If El Hadjar, and Sidi Amar are also included. Currently there are approximately 500,000 people in &quot;greater Annaba&quot;. Today Annaba has a population of 464,740 and 1,000,000 in greater Annaba.

==Urban areas==
The metropolitan area includes the cities of El Bouni, El Hadjar and Sidi Amar, which now form a circle around the city of Annaba. The city has grown dramatically since a major factory was opened at El Hadjar ( to the South) and provides employment for the entire region.

The downtown district of Annaba is on the sea-front, and includes the promenade called the Concours de la Revolution (previously called Le Cours Bertagna) which is a lively area, brimming with arcades and all kinds of covered restaurants, terraced cafes and kiosks.

The city is an important hub of the world steel industry with the steel complex of El Hadjar, south of the city. It is the largest in Africa. Phosphate and metal industries now include the Seybousa complex and the metallurgical complex of Allelik. The private industrial sector is also very important in Annaba and geared especially to the agri-food, metal processing, wood products and construction. These industrial areas occupy nearly between Bouchet Bridge, Meboudja, Berrahal and Kherraza. Business areas are also to be found in the suburbs of the city, such as Sidi Salem, El Eulma and Wadi El-Aneb.

==Transportation==
Annaba was described as the &quot;chief seaport of Algeria after Oran and Algiers,&quot; by Baedeker&#x27;s in 1911.

Annaba is served by Rabah Bitat Airport, an international airport whose IATA airport code is AAE. Annaba also has rail links to the Algerian cities of Constantine and Algiers, and it is at the end of Algeria&#x27;s east–west highway. It is the second industrial centre in Algeria after the capital Algiers.

==Tourism==
Annaba is an important centre for tourism, and is one of the major tourist attractions in the western Mediterranean. It is a coastal city with mountains, hills, foothills, and plains surrounding it. Due to this, and aside from maritime and seaside tourism, Annaba has a key potential for mountain tourism. The mountains around Seraïdi which rise to , make them a major tourist attraction. Other tourist attractions are &quot;West Bay&quot;, &quot;Djenane el Bey&quot; (La Grande Plage), &quot;Ras el Hamra&quot; and &quot;Ain Achir&quot; beach.

Annaba also has various key religious sites, including the Saint Augustin Basilica. Annaba in its early history, was the site of an important and influential Diocese, prior to its destruction by the Vandals, and the era of Islamisation. Annaba is located on the Tunisian border, and is a visa-free area, hence tourists are also able to make side trips to Tunisia and to El Kala National Park.

Annaba is also known for its verdant Main Street (more often known as the Concours de la Revolution), which is a bustling promenade also well known for its night-life. The Annaba area is generally reputed for having scenic beaches, hotels and a bustling nightlife.

The War Cemetery at Bône lies from Annaba on the road towards Constantine. It is an important memorial to the British Empire&#x27;s soldiers and airmen who fought in the region during the World War II, with 868 Commonwealth burials there. There are also 14 other graves, mostly of merchant seamen. It was designed by J. Hubert Worthington. After the war, most of the American dead were repatriated for burial in the United States, but this was not traditional in the British Empire.

<text>Kirkland M. Acevedo (born November 27, 1971) is an American actor. He is primarily known for his work on television for the portrayals of Miguel Alvarez in the HBO series &quot;Oz&quot;, Joe Toye in &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, and FBI Agent Charlie Francis in the science-fiction series &quot;Fringe&quot;. His best-known films are &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, &quot;Dinner Rush&quot; and &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot;. He also portrayed the character of José Ramse on Syfy&#x27;s &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (20152018), as well as comic book villain Ricardo Diaz / The Dragon on The CW&#x27;s &quot;Arrow&quot; (20172019).

== Early life==
Acevedo&#x27;s parents were born in New York City and lived in the Bronx, where both their sons, Richard and Kirk Acevedo, were born and raised. Acevedo is of Puerto Rican descent. Since childhood, Acevedo has shown an interest in acting; he performed before his family in improvised shows. Acevedo was a drama major in high school.

After graduating from LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts, Acevedo enrolled in the SUNY Purchase School of Acting (Purchase College). In the 1990s, Acevedo earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree and, as some of his classmates had landed parts shortly after auditioning for &quot;Oz&quot;, he was also motivated to try out, and subsequently landed the role of the half-crazed gang leader prisoner Miguel Alvarez.

==Career ==
After landing the role of Miguel Alvarez on &quot;Oz&quot;, Acevedo was promoted to series regular in season two and appeared in the following episodes: 1–26; 34–36 and 41–56. Among his other most notable credits include his roles in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury&quot; (2005) as Hector Salazar and HBO&#x27;s &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (2001), produced by Steven Spielberg, as Staff sergeant Joe Toye.

He had guest starring roles on well known television shows such as &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; and &quot;24&quot;. He had a notable recurring role on the television show &quot;The Black Donnellys&quot;.

Some of his most well known movies and miniseries he has starred in include &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, &quot;Invincible&quot; (2006), &quot;Boiler Room&quot; (2000), &quot;Dinner Rush&quot; (2000), &quot;Arresting Gena&quot; (1997) and &quot;Kirk and Kerry&quot; (1997). He voices Jackie Estacado in &quot;The Darkness&quot;, the video game adaptation of the comic book.

He starred on the show&#x27;s first season and in the episode &quot;Unleashed&quot;, Acevedo&#x27;s real-life wife, actress Kiersten Warren portrayed his on-screen wife. His character was killed in the second season premiere, though Acevedo made two further appearances portraying a shape-shifting imposter. Following the fifth episode of season two, Acevedo was no longer credited as a main cast member due to the shapeshifter&#x27;s death in the previous episode. Though he is credited as a main cast member for a standalone episode filmed at the end of the first season titled &quot;Unearthed&quot; that was broadcast as the eleventh episode of the second season. His character&#x27;s reappearance in the episode after being killed off has led to confusion among viewers of the series.

Acevedo officially returned as a guest star in &quot;Fringe&quot; for the second season finale as the parallel universe version of his character, and continued this recurring role for six episodes of the third season.

In 2011, he joined the main cast of the short-lived U.S remake of &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; portraying Detective Luisito Calderon. Initially, it was reported Alt-Charlie would appear in fewer episodes of the fourth season of &quot;Fringe&quot;, though this never happened and he never reappeared in the series following the third season episode &quot;Bloodline&quot;. Acevedo later appeared on &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; for two episodes of the fourth season.

He has starred in the Syfy television series &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;. Acevedo was cast in a recurring role in the sixth season of The CW television series &quot;Arrow&quot; in August 2017 as Ricardo Diaz and was promoted to series regular for the first 14 episodes of season seven.

<doc id="1251508" wikidata="Q10577628" url="?curid=1251508" title="Geothermal heating">
<text>Geothermal heating is the direct use of geothermal energy for some heating applications. Humans have taken advantage of geothermal heat this way since the Paleolithic era. Approximately seventy countries made direct use of a total of 270 PJ of geothermal heating in 2004. As of 2007, 28 GW of geothermal heating capacity is installed around the world, satisfying 0.07% of global primary energy consumption. Thermal efficiency is high since no energy conversion is needed, but capacity factors tend to be low (around 20%) since the heat is mostly needed in the winter.

Geothermal energy originates from the heat retained within the Earth since the original formation of the planet, from radioactive decay of minerals, and from solar energy absorbed at the surface. Most high temperature geothermal heat is harvested in regions close to tectonic plate boundaries where volcanic activity rises close to the surface of the Earth. In these areas, ground and groundwater can be found with temperatures higher than the target temperature of the application. However, even cold ground contains heat. Below , the undisturbed ground temperature is consistently at the mean annual air temperature, and this heat can be extracted with a ground source heat pump.

== Applications ==

There are a wide variety of applications for cheap geothermal heat including heating of houses, greenhouses, bathing and swimming or industrial uses. Most applications use geothermal in the form of hot fluids between 50 °C (122 °F) and 150 °C (302 °F). The suitable temperature varies for the different applications. For direct use of geothermal heat, the temperature range for the agricultural sector lies between 25 °C (77 °F) and 90 °C (194 °F), for space heating lies between 50 °C (122 °F) to 100 °C (212 °F). Heat pipes extend the temperature range down to 5 °C (41 °F) as they extract and &quot;amplify&quot; the heat. Geothermal heat exceeding 150 °C (302 °F) is typically used for geothermal power generation.

In 2004 more than half of direct geothermal heat was used for space heating, and a third was used for spas. The remainder was used for a variety of industrial processes, desalination, domestic hot water, and agricultural applications. The cities of Reykjavík and Akureyri pipe hot water from geothermal plants under roads and pavements to melt snow. Geothermal desalination has been demonstrated.

Geothermal systems tend to benefit from economies of scale, so space heating power is often distributed to multiple buildings, sometimes whole communities. This technique, long practiced throughout the world in locations such as Reykjavík, Iceland; Boise, Idaho; and Klamath Falls, Oregon; is known as district heating.

In Europe alone 280 geothermal district heating plants were in operation in 2016 according to the European Geothermal Energy Council (EGEC) with a total capacity of approximately 4.9 GWth.

== Extraction ==
Some parts of the world, including substantial portions of the western USA, are underlain by relatively shallow geothermal resources. Similar conditions exist in Iceland, parts of Japan, and other geothermal hot spots around the world. In these areas, water or steam may be captured from natural hot springs and piped directly into radiators or heat exchangers. Alternatively, the heat may come from waste heat supplied by co-generation from a geothermal electrical plant or from deep wells into hot aquifers. Direct geothermal heating is far more efficient than geothermal electricity generation and has less demanding temperature requirements, so it is viable over a large geographical range. If the shallow ground is hot but dry, air or water may be circulated through earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers which act as heat exchangers with the ground.

Steam under pressure from deep geothermal resources is also used to generate electricity from geothermal power. The Iceland Deep Drilling Project struck a pocket of magma at 2,100m. A cemented steelcase was constructed in the hole with a perforation at the bottom close to the magma. The high temperatures and pressure of the magma steam were used to generate 36MW of electricity, making IDDP-1 the world&#x27;s first magma-enhanced geothermal system.

In areas where the shallow ground is too cold to provide comfort directly, it is still warmer than the winter air. The thermal inertia of the shallow ground retains solar energy accumulated in the summertime, and seasonal variations in ground temperature disappear completely below 10m of depth. That heat can be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more efficiently than it can be generated by conventional furnaces. Geothermal heat pumps are economically viable essentially anywhere in the world.

In theory, geothermal energy (usually cooling) can also be extracted from existing infrastructure, such as municipal water pipes.

== Ground-source heat pumps ==

In regions without any high temperature geothermal resources, a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) can provide space heating and space cooling. Like a refrigerator or air conditioner, these systems use a heat pump to force the transfer of heat from the ground to the building. Heat can be extracted from any source, no matter how cold, but a warmer source allows higher efficiency. A ground-source heat pump uses the shallow ground or ground water (typically starting at ) as a source of heat, thus taking advantage of its seasonally moderate temperatures. In contrast, an air source heat pump draws heat from the air (colder outside air) and thus requires more energy.

GSHPs circulate a carrier fluid (usually a mixture of water and small amounts of antifreeze) through closed pipe loops buried in the ground. Single-home systems can be &quot;vertical loop field&quot; systems with bore holes deep or, if adequate land is available for extensive trenches, a &quot;horizontal loop field&quot; is installed approximately six feet subsurface. As the fluid circulates underground it absorbs heat from the ground and, on its return, the warmed fluid passes through the heat pump which uses electricity to extract heat from the fluid. The re-chilled fluid is sent back into the ground thus continuing the cycle. The heat extracted and that generated by the heat pump appliance as a byproduct is used to heat the house. The addition of the ground heating loop in the energy equation means that significantly more heat can be transferred to a building than if electricity alone had been used directly for heating.

Switching the direction of heat flow, the same system can be used to circulate the cooled water through the house for cooling in the summer months. The heat is exhausted to the relatively cooler ground (or groundwater) rather than delivering it to the hot outside air as an air conditioner does. As a result, the heat is pumped across a larger temperature difference and this leads to higher efficiency and lower energy use.

This technology makes ground source heating economically viable in any geographical location. In 2004, an estimated million ground-source heat pumps with a total capacity of 15 GW extracted 88 PJ of heat energy for space heating. Global ground-source heat pump capacity is growing by 10% annually.

== History ==
Hot springs have been used for bathing at least since Paleolithic times. The oldest known spa is a stone pool on China&#x27;s Mount Li built in the Qin dynasty in the 3rd century BC, at the same site where the Huaqing Chi palace was later built. Geothermal energy supplied channeled district heating for baths and houses in Pompeii around 0 AD. In the first century AD, Romans conquered Aquae Sulis in England and used the hot springs there to feed public baths and underfloor heating. The admission fees for these baths probably represents the first commercial use of geothermal power. A 1,000-year-old hot tub has been located in Iceland, where it was built by one of the island&#x27;s original settlers. The world&#x27;s oldest working geothermal district heating system in Chaudes-Aigues, France, has been operating since the 14th century. The earliest industrial exploitation began in 1827 with the use of geyser steam to extract boric acid from volcanic mud in Larderello, Italy.

In 1892, America&#x27;s first district heating system in Boise, Idaho, was powered directly by geothermal energy, and was soon copied in Klamath Falls, Oregon in 1900. A deep geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in 1926, and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time. Charlie Lieb developed the first downhole heat exchanger in 1930 to heat his house. Steam and hot water from the geysers began to be used to heat homes in Iceland in 1943.

By this time, Lord Kelvin had already invented the heat pump in 1852, and Heinrich Zoelly had patented the idea of using it to draw heat from the ground in 1912. But it was not until the late 1940s that the geothermal heat pump was successfully implemented. The earliest one was probably Robert C. Webber&#x27;s home-made 2.2 kW direct-exchange system, but sources disagree as to the exact timeline of his invention. J. Donald Kroeker designed the first commercial geothermal heat pump to heat the Commonwealth Building (Portland, Oregon) and demonstrated it in 1946. Professor Carl Nielsen of Ohio State University built the first residential open loop version in his home in 1948. The technology became popular in Sweden as a result of the 1973 oil crisis, and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then. The 1979 development of polybutylene pipe greatly augmented the heat pump&#x27;s economic viability. Since 2000, a compelling body of research has been dedicated to numerically evidence the advantages and efficiency of using CO2, alternative to water, as heat transmission fluid for geothermal energy recovery from enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) where the permeability of the underground source is enhanced by hydrofracturing. As of 2004, there are over one million geothermal heat pumps installed worldwide providing 12 GW of thermal capacity. Each year, about 80,000 units are installed in the US and 27,000 in Sweden.

== Economics ==
Geothermal energy is a type of renewable energy that encourages conservation of natural resources. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, geo-exchange systems save homeowners 30–70 percent in heating costs, and 20–50 percent in cooling costs, compared to conventional systems. Geo-exchange systems also save money because they require much less maintenance. In addition to being highly reliable they are built to last for decades.

Some utilities, such as Kansas City Power and Light, offer special, lower winter rates for geothermal customers, offering even more savings.

==Geothermal drilling risks==
In geothermal heating projects the underground is penetrated by trenches or drillholes. As with all underground work, projects may cause problems if the geology of the area is poorly understood.

In the spring of 2007 an exploratory geothermal drilling operation was conducted to provide geothermal heat to the town hall of Staufen im Breisgau. After initially sinking a few millimeters, a process called subsidence, the city center has started to rise gradually causing considerable damage to buildings in the city center, affecting numerous historic houses including the town hall. It is hypothesized that the drilling perforated an anhydrite layer bringing high-pressure groundwater to come into contact with the anhydrite, which then began to expand. Currently no end to the rising process is in sight. Data from the TerraSAR-X radar satellite before and after the changes confirmed the localised nature of the situation:

A geochemical process called anhydrite swelling has been confirmed as the cause of these uplifts. This is a transformation of the mineral anhydrite (anhydrous calcium sulphate) into gypsum (hydrous calcium sulphate). A pre-condition for this transformation is that the anhydrite is in contact with water, which is then stored in its crystalline structure.

There are other sources of potential risks, i.e.: cave enlargement or worsening of stability conditions, quality or quantity degradation of groundwater resources, Specific hazard worsening in the case of landslide-prone areas, worsening of rocky mechanical characteristics, soil and water pollution (i.e. due to antifreeze additives or polluting constructive and boring material). The design defined on the base of site-specific geological, hydrogeological and environmental knowledge prevent all these potential risks.

<text>The 1st Army () was a World War II field army.
==Operational history==

=== 1939 ===
The 1st Army was activated on 26 August 1939, in Wehrkreis XII with General Erwin von Witzleben in command. Its primary mission was to take defensive positions and guard the western defences (West Wall) of Germany against Allied forces along the Maginot Line during the attack on Poland, making it the principal German combatant during the short-lived French Saar Offensive.

=== 1940 ===
During the Western campaign it belonged to the Army Group C and initially remained passive towards the Maginot Line. the 1st Army continued its defensive assignment on the French border until June 1940, when the Battle of France had turned decisively to Germany&#x27;s favor.

Starting on 14 June 1940, the 1st Army began the penetration of the Maginot Line, breaking through French defenses, it began concentrating its forces in the frontier sector south of Saarbrücken. Another penetration was conducted north of Wörth am Main on 19 June. Beginning on 21 June and until 24 June, the 1st Army participated in the annihilation of the remnants of the French forces in the Moselle and Vosges regions.

After the end of the western campaign, the army remained in France. It secured the demarcation line and then the Atlantic coast (Atlantic Wall) in southwest France until May 1942, when they were moved to Normandy.

=== 1944 ===
After the French capitulation, the 1st Army spent until mid-1944 protecting the Atlantic coast of France from a possible seaborne incursion. At the time of the first Allied Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, the 1st Army, then under Kurt von der Chevallerie was headquartered at Bordeaux and attached to Johannes Blaskowitz&#x27;s Army Group G at Toulouse, along with 19th Army (Georg von Sodenstern) at Avignon. was pushed back to the western border of the German Reich. and reorganized in Lorraine after a hasty retreat with the rest of the German forces across France, in August 1944, During the battles along the German frontier, the First Army attempted to prevent the Third United States Army from crossing the Moselle River and capturing Metz while also attempting to hold the northern Vosges Mountains against the Seventh United States Army.

In November 1944, both defensive lines were broken and the First Army retreated to the German border and defended the Saarland of Germany, an important industrial region.

=== 1945 ===
With the Third U.S. Army engaged to the north against the German Ardennes Offensive, the 1st Army attacked the Seventh U.S. Army on New Year&#x27;s Day 1945 in Operation Nordwind, causing the Americans to give ground and inflicting significant casualties where Seventh U.S. Army defensive lines were stretched taut by the length of frontage they had to cover. With the failure of &quot;Nordwind&quot; in late January, the 1st Army was first pushed back to the Siegfried Line and then forced to retreat across the Rhine River. From March 15 to March 24, 1945 during Operation Undertone, the 7th US Army on a broad front surrounded to the 1st Army near Kaiserslautern. However, when the Allies pierced the German fortifications, they were forced to retreat. Thereafter, the First Army made an ordered withdrawal to the Danube River, and later to Munich. On May 6, 1945, near the Alps, the 1st army surrendered to allied forces.

<text>Rusty Pierce (born July 24, 1979, in The Woodlands, Texas) is an American former professional soccer player who spent eight seasons in Major League Soccer.

==Career==

===College===
Pierce played college soccer at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro from 1997 to 1999, appearing in 51 games during his time there. Following his junior season, Pierce signed a Project-40 contract with Major League Soccer, entering the 2000 MLS SuperDraft, where he was selected 14th overall by the New England Revolution.

===Professional===

====New England Revolution====

The Revolution selected Pierce in the SuperDraft on February 6, 2000. As a rookie, Pierce quickly earned a place in the Revolution starting lineup with his tenacious defending, and finished the season second on the team in minutes played, having started in 29 of the team&#x27;s 32 games. Pierce made his Revolution debut (and first start) on March 18 against the Miami Fusion in the season opener, and his home debut on April 15 against D.C. United in the Revolution&#x27;s home opener. He was named Revolution Defender of the Year for the 2000 season, and re-signed with the Revolution on March 20, 2001.

Pierce remained a constant in the New England backline for the next four years when healthy, although injuries limited his playing time in the 2002 and 2004 seasons.

====Later Career====

Following the 2004 season, Pierce&#x27;s impending free agency led the Revolution to leave him unprotected for the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft, where he was selected in the eighth round by Real Salt Lake. After the 2005 season, his rights were traded to the Columbus Crew, where he played 2 years

Following a year out of soccer, during which Pierce founded a financial investment company and worked as a real estate broker in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Pierce returned to the game in 2009 to play for the Wilmington Hammerheads in the USL Second Division.

===International===
Pierce has played for United States national team at a number of youth levels, but is uncapped at the senior level.

<text>was a Japanese novelist and author, born in Kumagaya. He is best known for the controversial &quot;&quot; (悪魔の飽食) (1981), which revealed the atrocities committed by Unit 731 of the Imperial Japanese Army during the Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).

&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Gluttony&quot; was serialized in the &quot;Shimbun Akahata&quot; (Japanese Communist Party&#x27;s newspaper) in 1980, and subsequently published by Kobunsha (光文社), in two volumes in 1981 and 1982. In the ensuing controversy, half of a photograph was discovered to be a fabrication, and Kobunsha subsequently withdrew the book. A second edition was then published by Kadokawa Shoten in 1983 with the controversial photograph removed.

Morimura won the Edogawa Rampo Prize in 1969 for &quot;Death in the High-Rise&quot; (高層の死角).

His short story &quot;Devil of a Boy&quot; appears translated into English in &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Japanese Golden Dozen: The Detective Story World in Japan&quot; anthology, which was edited by Ellery Queen.

Seiichi Morimura died of pneumonia on July 24, 2023, at the age of 90.

<doc id="1251524" wikidata="Q617573" url="?curid=1251524" title="Folivore">
<text>In zoology, a folivore is a herbivore that specializes in eating leaves. Mature leaves contain a high proportion of hard-to-digest cellulose, less energy than other types of foods, and often toxic compounds. For this reason, folivorous animals tend to have long digestive tracts and slow metabolisms. Many enlist the help of symbiotic bacteria to release the nutrients in their diet. Additionally, as has been observed in folivorous primates, they exhibit a strong preference for immature leaves which tend to be easier to masticate, are higher in energy and protein, and lower in fibre and poisons than more mature fibrous leaves.

==Folivory and flight==

It has been observed that folivory is extremely rare among flying vertebrates. Morton (1978) attributed this to the fact that leaves are heavy, slow to digest, and contain little energy relative to other foods. The hoatzin is an example of a flighted, folivorous bird, but it is a weak flier, due to the well-developed foregut (used to digest its food) reducing the area available for flight muscles to attach. There are, however, many species of folivorous flying insects. 

Some bats are partially folivorous; their method of deriving nourishment from leaves, according to Lowry (1989), is to chew up the leaves, swallowing the sap and spitting out the remainder.

==Arboreal folivores==

Arboreal mammalian folivores, such as sloths, koalas, and some species of monkeys and lemurs, tend to be large and climb cautiously. Similarities in body shape and head- and tooth-structure between early hominoids and various families of arboreal folivores have been advanced as evidence that early hominoids were also folivorous.

==Primates==
Standard ecological theory predicts relatively large group sizes for folivorous primates, as large groups offer better collective defense against predators and they face little competition for food among each other. It has been observed that these animals nevertheless frequently live in small groups. Explanations offered for this apparent paradox include social factors such as increased incidence of infanticide in large groups.
Folivorous primates are relatively rare in the New World, the primary exception being howler monkeys. One explanation that has been offered is that fruiting and leafing occur simultaneously among New World plants. However a 2001 study found no evidence for simultaneous fruiting and leafing at most sites, apparently disproving this hypothesis.

==Examples==
Examples of folivorous animals include:

* Mammals: okapis, elephants, sloths, possums, giant pandas, koalas and various species of monkey, i.e. New World howlers and Old World colobines
* Birds: The hoatzin of the Amazon region and the kākāpō of New Zealand
* Reptiles: iguanas
* Insects: various kinds of caterpillars, sawflies, beetles, leaf miners and Orthoptera
* Others: many land gastropod species (snails and slugs)

<doc id="1251531" wikidata="Q1969956" url="?curid=1251531" title="Our Private World">
<text>Our Private World is a 1965 American serial. It was the only primetime spin-off from a daytime soap (&quot;As the World Turns&quot;, the number-one daytime soap opera at the time). Created by Irna Phillips and William J. Bell, it premiered on May 5, 1965, and aired Wednesdays and Fridays over the summer; the multiple-episode-per-week format was inspired by ABC&#x27;s hit show &quot;Peyton Place&quot;. The final episode aired on September 10 of the same year. &quot;Our Private World&quot; starred Eileen Fulton as Lisa Miller Hughes, the same heroine she had played on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, and Nicolas Coster. A total of 38 half-hour episodes were produced. Also in the cast were film star Geraldine Fitzgerald and stage actress Julienne Marie.

The storyline started on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, with Lisa boarding a train to Chicago and the announcer (Dan McCullough) encouraging the audience to watch the spin-off. Upon arriving, Lisa took a job in the admitting room of the local hospital and met her wealthy future husband John Eldredge (Coster, who decades later also played Lisa&#x27;s seventh husband, Eduardo Grimaldi). A few months after the demise of the series, Fulton returned to &quot;As the World Turns&quot;.

Nearly three decades later, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; writers resurrected remnants of Lisa&#x27;s &quot;Our Private World&quot; storyline, when a previously unmentioned son whom Lisa had while in Chicago (presumably during the period between the end of &quot;Our Private World&quot; and Fulton&#x27;s return to &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in early 1966) resurfaced and made contact with her.

For its run from May until September 1965, the series was aired on CBS on Wednesdays at 9:30 pm and Fridays at 9:00 pm.

<text>In an attempt to develop the French Congo the government of France divided the territory in concessions for companies to develop. These several dozen companies controlled huge swaths of land, but had only limited success in trying to develop them. Most were merged into several larger companies that were more strictly controlled by the state after the French Congo was dissolved in 1906.

<text>Nikolai Ivanovich Krylov (; 29 April 1903 – 9 February 1972) was a Russian Marshal of the Soviet Union (from 1962). He was commander of the Strategic Missile Troops from 1963 to 1972.

==Early life==
Krylov was born into a family of rural teachers. He joined the Komsomol in 1918, and was the secretary of the district Komsomol cell and a fighter of the volunteer party Komsomol Red Guard detachment.

During the Russian Civil War, he tried to join the Red Army. At the beginning of 1919, he was enrolled in the aviation division of the Southern Front, but after a few days he fell seriously ill and was left with his parents. At the same time, he passed the exam for the school course as an external student and received a certificate of graduation from the 2nd stage school.

==Military career==
===Russian Civil War===
In April 1919, at the age of 16, he achieved enrollment in the Red Army. After successfully completing the Saratov infantry and machine gun courses in 1920, he was appointed commander of a rifle platoon, then a half-company of riflemen in the 28th Rifle Division named after V.M. Azin. In the ranks of the 11th Army, he fought on the Southern Front and took part in the occupation of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in the Soviet-Georgian war of 1921. On the same year, he was transferred to the Russian Far East, where aged 19, he was appointed commander of a rifle battalion in the 3rd Verkhne-Uda Regiment of the 1st Pacific Division of the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army in the Far Eastern Republic. He participated in the liberation of Spassk, Nikolsk-Ussuriysky and Vladivostok from the White Army.

===Post-civil war===

After the end of the civil war, Krylov remained in the Red Army and continued to serve in the Far East, where he commanded a battalion.
From 1923, he served as assistant chief of staff of a rifle regiment. Krylov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1927 and graduated from Advanced Training Courses for the Command Staff of the Red Army in August 1928.

From 1929, he served as chief of staff of a rifle regiment in the 1st Pacific Rifle Division. Krylov commanded the Blagoveshchensk Fortified Region from 1931. In 1936, he was appointed as chief of staff of the fortified region. Krylov was assigned as head of the department of Osoaviakhim in Stavropol in 1939. In May 1941, he was appointed chief of staff of the Danube Fortified Region on the southern section of the Soviet-Romanian border in the Odessa Military District.

===World War II===
====Eastern Front====

Following the outbreak of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, Krylov led the fight against Romanian troops who tried unsuccessfully to cross the Soviet border. When the threat of enemy occupation loomed, the Soviet troops were withdrawn from the border and Krylov became the deputy chief of the coastal army&#x27;s operational department in July 1941.

Since there was a lack of commanders in the besieged Odessa, he became chief of the operational department of the army on 11 August and the chief of staff of the coastal army on 21 August. He remained in this position from the beginning to the end of the defense of Odessa and Sevastopol. During a visit outside the dugout with two others, the Germans fired off mortar rounds, killing one of the men and severely wounding Krylov on 8 January 1942. He would suffer from this injury for the rest of his life.
On 27 December 1941, he was appointed major general and was evacuated from the city in the last days of its defense by a Soviet Navy submarine. He was in the reserve for more than a month, during which time he wrote a report on the defense of Sevastopol.

In August 1942, Krylov was appointed Chief of Staff of the 1st Guards Army. Just a few days later, he was urgently summoned to Stalingrad and appointed chief of staff of the 62nd Army, which fought many months of street battles in the city during the battle of Stalingrad. Until the arrival of the new commander-in-chief Vasily Chuikov, he commanded the army in the battle for the city for more than a month. There he became a close friend with Chuikov and was also member of the Military Council of the Front led by Nikita Khrushchev, who was his superior.

After the victory at Stalingrad, General Krylov was appointed commander of the 3rd Reserve Army of the Headquarters of the Supreme High Command in May 1943. From July 1943, he served as commander of the 21st and 5th Armies of the Western Front. During this time, his armies participated in the Orsha and Vitebsk offensives in 1943. Krylov&#x27;s army was transferred to 3rd Belorussian Front. Commanding this army, Krylov successfully led them during Operation Bagration, when his army units successfully advanced near Vitebsk, Orsha and Minsk, and stormed Vilnius and repulsed enemy counter-attacks near Kaunas. For excellent command of troops, by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR dated 19 April 1945, Krylov was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union and was promoted to Colonel General on 15 July 1944.

Due to his old injury, he was in a Moscow hospital for two months at the end of 1944 and then returned to command of his army units during the East Prussian offensive.

====Soviet-Japanese War====
After the victory over Germany, the 5th Army in full strength was transferred to the Far East, where it became part of the 1st Far Eastern Front commanded by Marshal Kirill Meretskov. Kyrlov led the 5th Army in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, where he led the army to break through the deeply echeloned border defensive line in Manchuria, and liberated the cities of Muling and Mudanjiang.

For the successful defeat of the opposing enemy groupings in this operation, Krylov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for the second time.

===Post-war===
From October 1945, Krylov served as deputy commander of the Primorsky Military District. From January 1947, he was appointed as commander of the Far Eastern Military District. In March 1953, the district was reorganized into the army, which was included in the new united Far Eastern Military District. Krylov commanded this army for about six months, before being appointed as first deputy commander of the Far Eastern Military District in September 1953. At the same time, on 18 September 1953, he was awarded the military rank of General of the Army. From January 1956, he served as commander of the Ural Military District and from 1958, commander of the Leningrad Military District. In 1960, he was appointed as commander of the Moscow Military District. Krylov became Marshal of the Soviet Union on 28 April 1962.

In March 1963, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Strategic Rocket Forces. He was responsible for its founding, which had to be brought into combat readiness within a short time and whose new technology had to be tested in cooperation with the designers. The development of missile forces was also accelerated by the Cuban Missile Crisis. Krylov, missile designer Mikhail Yangel and a number of other specialists agreed that it was necessary to build new underground launch pads and put new missile complexes into operation. Krylov&#x27;s duties also included inspections of all parts and departments of the missile forces. He was also responsible for building military towns where military personnel and their families lived.

Krylov died on 9 February 1972, at the age of 68, just nine days after the death of Marshal Matvei Zakharov. The urn containing his ashes is buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

<doc id="1251538" wikidata="Q8561" url="?curid=1251538" title="Supreme Court of Afghanistan">
<text>The Supreme Court of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, known locally as the Stera Mahkama (; ), is the court of last resort of Afghanistan. Under the current Taliban government, the court has no independence or power of judicial review; the supreme leader of Afghanistan holds the ultimate authority to decide and interpret the law and may overturn any decision of any court. The current chief justice is Abdul Hakim Haqqani.

== Democratic Republic (until 1992) ==
During Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Supreme Court have been chaired by Nizamuddin Tahzib then by Abdul Karim Shadan.

==Islamic Republic (2004–2021)==
The Supreme Court of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was the court of last resort in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. It was created by the Constitution of Afghanistan, which was approved on January 4, 2004. Its creation was called for by the Bonn Agreement, which read in part:

:The judicial power of Afghanistan shall be independent and shall be vested in a Supreme Court of Afghanistan, and such other courts as may be established by the Interim Administration.

At the time of its dissolution, the court was made up of the following justices:
*Chief Justice Sayed Yousuf Halim
*Dr. Abdul Malik Kamawi
* Barat Ali Mateen 
* Pohadowy Abdulqader Adalatkhwah 
* Abdul Haseb Ahadi 
* Mohammad Zaman Sangari 

The nine justices on the tribunal are appointed for 10-year terms by the President of Afghanistan, with the approval of the Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of the nation&#x27;s legislature. The President selects one of the nine members to serve as Chief Justice. The constitution allows for judges to be trained in either civil or Islamic law. Matters of law with no provision in the constitution or other standing laws shall be judged by the Hanafi jurisprudence. The judiciary shall apply the Shia school of law in cases dealing with personal matters of those who are of the Shia sect, where applicable.

The Court was previously dominated by conservative religious figures and the former Chief Justice, Fazal Hadi Shinwari, in particular was described as &quot;ultra conservative.&quot; Several of its rulings disappointed reform-minded Afghans and people in the Western world. For instance:

* the court, during the 2004 presidential election campaign, sought to ban a candidate who questioned whether polygamy was in keeping with the spirit of Islam;
* they have called for an end to cable television service in the country, at least pending government regulation, due in part to the apparent influence of films from Bollywood, which were allegedly prurient;
* the court upheld the death penalty for two journalists convicted of blasphemy for saying the Islam being practised in the country was reactionary;
* they banned women from singing on television; and
* they ruled that a girl, given as a bride when 9 years old and now 13, could not get a divorce from her abusive husband, notwithstanding a law that makes it illegal for girls under 16 to marry.
* they ruled that the punishment for homosexuality is death, even through the penal code of 1976 stipulates long prison sentence for adultery and sodomy.

In 2006, President Hamid Karzai appointed several new, more moderate members to the court. However, he also chose to renominate Faisal Ahmad Shinwari as Chief Justice. Despite controversy surrounding the validity of Shinwari&#x27;s legal credentials, his nomination was allowed to continue, but ultimately failed when voted on in the National Assembly. Karzai then chose his legal counsel, Abdul Salam Azimi, to succeed Shinwari. Azimi&#x27;s nomination passed, and the new court was sworn in on August 5, 2006.

On January 17, 2021, 2 female judges working at the Afghan supreme court were killed as they were driving to work.

==Building==
The Supreme Court is housed in a four storey office building on Great Massoud Road next to Massoud Circle. On February 7, 2017, a suicide bomber killed 20 people outside the building.

<text>The Sobaek Mountains (, literally mean little Taebaek Mountains) are a mountain range cutting across the southern Korean peninsula. They split off from the Taebaek Mountains and trend southwest across the center of the peninsula. They are traditionally considered to reach their southwestern limit at Jirisan, which, at an elevation of 1,915 meters, is also the highest peak of the range. Other famous mountains in the range include Songni Mountain, Joryeong Mountain, Gaya Mountain, Worak Mountain, and Sobaek Mountain itself. The peaks of the Sobaek Mountains are generally well over 1,000 m above sea level. 

The Sobaek Mountains form the southern half of the Baekdu-daegan, the symbolic &quot;spine&quot; of Korea. They mark the traditional border between the Honam and Yeongnam regions.

<text>Woraksan, or Worak Mountain, is a major mountain of the Sobaek mountain range in South Korea. Its highest peak is above sea level. It forms part of the boundary between North Chungcheong and North Gyeongsang provinces. Its slopes contain portions of Mungyeong city in North Gyeongsang, as well as Danyang County, Jecheon City, and Chungju City in North Chungcheong. Woraksan National Park takes up 28% of the land in Danyang County.

Worak Mountain is the centerpiece of Woraksan National Park, and its slopes are home to numerous Buddhist shrines and historical sites. The area is known for its beauty and history, and is sometimes referred to as &quot;Little Kumgang-san&quot; to compare it with that famed Korean mountain. The tenth-century Later Baekje king Kyŏn Hwŏn, who was born nearby, allegedly planned to build a palace on the slopes of Worak Mountain, although he was never able to do so. Woraksan was designated a &quot;global park&quot; in 2004 by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Conservation Monitoring Center.

<doc id="1251552" wikidata="Q5105996" url="?curid=1251552" title="Chris Brown (soccer, born 1977)">
<text>Chris Brown (born March 10, 1977, in Portland, Oregon) is an American soccer midfielder and forward who last played for Portland Timbers of USL-1.

==Youth==
Brown is an alumnus of Jesuit High School in Portland Oregon where he played soccer under the guidance of Dave Nicholas, varsity coach for the Crusaders. Brown played college soccer at the University of Portland from 1995 to 1998, scoring a total of 33 goals in his four years there, and being awarded for the MAC Award as a senior.

==Professional==
On February 2, 1999, Brown was selected fifth overall in the 1999 MLS College Draft by the Kansas City Wizards. He immediately earned a spot in the Wizards rotation as a rookie, playing in 28 games and starting 19, while scoring four goals and making three assists. He saw reduced playing time in 2000 after the Wizards&#x27; acquisition of Miklos Molnar, appearing in 22 games but only registering one assist; he did, however, make four appearances, two of them starts, assisting Kansas City in winning their first MLS Cup. Brown regained his starting spot in 2001, and would fluctuate between being a starter and a valuable substitute for Kansas City for the next three years.

However, during the 2003 season, the Wizards traded Brown along with Darío Fabbro to the New England Revolution in exchange for Wolde Harris and Jorge Vazquez. In his first start there, Brown&#x27;s explosive scoring yielded him a hat-trick. However, he was traded again during the 2003 off-season to the San Jose Earthquakes the then reigning MLS champions, making it difficult for Brown to displace veteran team members and capture a starting position. In San Jose, he finished the season with two goals and one assist in eleven appearances. When the MLS announced two expansion teams, Brown was recruited by John Ellinger inaugural coach of Real Salt Lake to come and play for him there where he has remained a versatile and consistent starter. He was waived at the end of 2007 and signed for USL-1 side Portland Timbers in January, 2008. In January 2009, Brown announced his retirement from playing professional soccer.

<doc id="1251555" wikidata="Q1143589" url="?curid=1251555" title="Culver's">
<text>Culver Franchising System, LLC, doing business as Culver&#x27;s, is an American fast-casual restaurant chain. The company was founded in 1984 by George, Ruth, Craig, and Lea Culver. The first location opened in Sauk City, Wisconsin, on July 18, 1984, under the name &quot;Culver&#x27;s Frozen Custard and ButterBurgers.&quot; The privately held company is headquartered in Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin. The chain operates primarily in the Midwestern United States, and has a total of 1000 restaurants in 26 states 

==History==

Sauk City restaurateurs and husband and wife team George and Ruth Culver started their fast food careers as the owners of an A&amp;W on Phillips Boulevard (U.S. Highway 12) in 1961. In 1968, they purchased a resort-styled restaurant at Devil&#x27;s Lake called The Farm Kitchen. Their son, Craig Culver, worked for a local McDonald&#x27;s right out of college in 1973. On July 18, 1984, George, Ruth, their son Craig, and his wife Lea opened the first Culver&#x27;s Frozen Custard and ButterBurgers in Sauk City, Wisconsin. Craig was CEO of Culver&#x27;s from its inception until mid-2015. 

On June 15, 2015, Phil Keiser became the second CEO of the franchise, until his death in October 2016. On January 1, 2017, Joe Koss became the third CEO of Culver&#x27;s, until his retirement at the end of 2020.

In October 2017, Culver&#x27;s sold a minority share to Roark Capital Group, a private equity firm based in Atlanta. The Culver family retains majority ownership.

On March 29, 2021, Enrique &quot;Rick&quot; Silva became the fourth CEO of Culver&#x27;s.

In 2024, Culver&#x27;s celebrated its 40th anniversary and Governor Tony Evers officially declared July 18 &quot;Culvers Day&quot; in Wisconsin.

===Wisconsin===

In 1988, the Culver family were approached about franchising a restaurant in nearby Richland Center. The family agreed, granting the franchisee a loose licensing agreement, charging no fees or royalties. Because the franchisee had invested very little of his own money, it was a simple matter for him to walk away a year later when he decided he no longer wanted to be in the restaurant business.

As a result of this experience, the Culver family established a set of standard franchising procedures that form the basis for those currently used by Culver Franchising System, Inc. Three years later, they tried again in Baraboo, and business quickly doubled. Soon after, the increased recognition that the second store earned this small-town chain prompted expansion into the Middleton, Madison and Milwaukee areas.

===Midwest===

In 1993, Culver&#x27;s was still a small, local chain, with only 14 restaurants across southern Wisconsin. Culver&#x27;s first restaurants outside Wisconsin opened in Buffalo, Minnesota, in September 1995, Roscoe, Illinois, in December 1995, and Dubuque, Iowa, in November 1997. In February 1998, the company opened the first Culver&#x27;s outside the Midwest in Texas.

===Beyond the Midwest===

The current franchising strategy is one of strategic expansion. The chain expanded into Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Cheyenne, Wyoming, in 2005, followed by an opening in Bowling Green, Kentucky, in July 2006. Culver&#x27;s shifted its attention to developing markets beyond the Midwest.

The Metro-98 prototype, developed in 2006 and first constructed in Fort Dodge, Iowa, was much more compact than the traditional 120-seat format commonly built through much of Culver&#x27;s expansion. While the Metro-98 has less seating to offer guests, it also reduced the amount of land needed for construction by around 20%.

In 2008, Culver&#x27;s expanded to the Phoenix metropolitan area. 

In 2011, Culver&#x27;s expanded into Utah, when Kristin and Tom Davis of Wisconsin relocated to Utah and opened a 100-seat Culver&#x27;s franchise in Midvale. The couple signed a development agreement for four locations in the southern half of Salt Lake County.

At the end of 2011, 445 Culver&#x27;s restaurants were open in 19 states. Culver&#x27;s also opened in South Carolina in 2012; Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee in 2014; and North Carolina in 2015. On June 28, 2018, Culver&#x27;s had announced that a location would be opening in Alabama. In January 2022, Culver&#x27;s expanded into the state of Arkansas.

===Venture into casual dining===

Culver&#x27;s Blue Spoon Cafe opened its first store in Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin, in 2000 as a soup-sandwich-salad restaurant as Blue Spoon Creamery Cafe. The name Blue Spoon comes from the color of the spoons used at the Culver&#x27;s fast food restaurants. A second store in Middleton, Wisconsin, was open for two years but closed in August 2010. The Prairie du Sac location closed in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

===More recent developments===

In 2013, according to a survey by Franchise Business Review, &quot;Culver Franchising System was rated No. 1 in franchisee satisfaction among restaurant franchises.&quot;

==Menu==

Culver&#x27;s menu comprises butter burgers, chicken sandwiches, fish, salads, french fries, and cheese curds. For dessert, the restaurant offers its frozen custard, served in either a dish, cone, or blended into a concrete mixer or shake.

On October 15, 2021, in celebration of National Cheese Curd Day, Culver&#x27;s sold a limited-time product: the CurderBurger, consisting of a large cheese curd on top of a burger patty. On April 1, Culver&#x27;s released an April Fools&#x27; joke showing a large fried cheese curd in a burger bun, naming it the CurderBurger. Soon after the post was made, a change.org petition was created to make the burger a reality, gathering over 600 signatures. Each location only got a limited number of cheese curd patties, and all Madison, Wisconsin, restaurants sold out before noon.

==Sponsorships==

Culver&#x27;s sponsors sports teams, including the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WIAC), Wisconsin Badgers, Minnesota Golden Gophers, Madison Mallards, Green Bay Packers, American Family Insurance Championship, Culver&#x27;s Cup Hockey Tournament, Jeff Trickey QB Camps, Isthmus Bowl and Wisconsin Junior Boys &amp; Girls Golf Championships. Culver&#x27;s also sponsors the WIAC baseball championship.

==Official mascots==

The official Culver&#x27;s mascot is an anthropomorphic custard cone named Scoopie, featured in various advertisements, community events, and fundraisers. Along the way, three new characters were added: Curdis the Curd, Goldie the Curd and Sundae the Turtle.

<doc id="1251559" wikidata="Q310647" url="?curid=1251559" title="Club set">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in mathematical logic and set theory, a club set is a subset of a limit ordinal that is closed under the order topology, and is unbounded (see below) relative to the limit ordinal. The name &quot;club&quot; is a contraction of &quot;closed and unbounded&quot;.

==Formal definition==

Formally, if formula_1 is a limit ordinal, then a set formula_2 is &quot;closed&quot; in formula_1 if and only if for every formula_4 if formula_5 then formula_6 Thus, if the limit of some sequence from formula_7 is less than formula_8 then the limit is also in formula_9

If formula_1 is a limit ordinal and formula_11 then formula_7 is unbounded in formula_1 if for any formula_4 there is some formula_15 such that formula_16

If a set is both closed and unbounded, then it is a club set. Closed proper classes are also of interest (every proper class of ordinals is unbounded in the class of all ordinals).

For example, the set of all countable limit ordinals is a club set with respect to the first uncountable ordinal; but it is not a club set with respect to any higher limit ordinal, since it is neither closed nor unbounded.
If formula_1 is an uncountable initial ordinal, then the set of all limit ordinals formula_18 is closed unbounded in formula_19 In fact a club set is nothing else but the range of a normal function (i.e. increasing and continuous).

More generally, if formula_20 is a nonempty set and formula_21 is a cardinal, then formula_22 (the set of subsets of formula_20 of cardinality formula_21) is &quot;club&quot; if every union of a subset of formula_7 is in formula_7 and every subset of formula_20 of cardinality less than formula_21 is contained in some element of formula_7 (see stationary set).

==The closed unbounded filter==

Let formula_30 be a limit ordinal of uncountable cofinality formula_31 For some formula_32, let formula_33 be a sequence of closed unbounded subsets of formula_34 Then formula_35 is also closed unbounded. To see this, one can note that an intersection of closed sets is always closed, so we just need to show that this intersection is unbounded. So fix any formula_36 and for each &quot;n&quot; &lt; ω choose from each formula_37 an element formula_38 which is possible because each is unbounded. Since this is a collection of fewer than formula_39 ordinals, all less than formula_40 their least upper bound must also be less than formula_40 so we can call it formula_42 This process generates a countable sequence formula_43 The limit of this sequence must in fact also be the limit of the sequence formula_44 and since each formula_37 is closed and formula_39 is uncountable, this limit must be in each formula_47 and therefore this limit is an element of the intersection that is above formula_48 which shows that the intersection is unbounded. QED.

From this, it can be seen that if formula_30 is a regular cardinal, then formula_50 is a non-principal formula_30-complete proper filter on the set formula_1 (that is, on the poset formula_53).

If formula_30 is a regular cardinal then club sets are also closed under diagonal intersection.

In fact, if formula_30 is regular and formula_56 is any filter on formula_40 closed under diagonal intersection, containing all sets of the form formula_58 for formula_59 then formula_56 must include all club sets.

<text>Anne Beadell Highway is an outback unsealed track linking Coober Pedy, South Australia, and Laverton, Western Australia, a total distance of . The track was surveyed and built by Len Beadell, Australian surveyor, who named it after his wife.

The track passes through remote arid deserts and scrub territory of South Australia and Western Australia, which often have summer temperatures approaching . Sand dunes predominate for most of the track.

==Map and overview==

The road was constructed to provide access for a series of surveys, adding to the overall geodetic survey of unexplored parts of Australia. The information was required for rocket range projects at Woomera.
Construction was completed in five stages, spanning nine years from 1953 to 1962. The first stage from Mabel Creek station near Coober Pedy, west towards Emu Field, was built in February and March 1953 to provide access for British atomic tests at Emu Field. This stage preceded the formation of Beadell&#x27;s Gunbarrel Road Construction Party, and was the first road built by Beadell.

The second stage was begun in July 1957 in the reverse direction, from Anne&#x27;s Corner towards Emu Field, after Beadell had completed the Mount Davies Road in the north-west of South Australia. The third stage started in August 1961, running westward from Anne&#x27;s Corner to Vokes Hill. In April 1962 the fourth stage proceeded west from Vokes Hill, beyond Serpentine Lakes towards the future Neale Junction where the construction party arrived in August.

From Neale Junction during August and September 1962, the north–south Connie Sue Highway was constructed between Warburton and Rawlinna. The fifth stage of the Anne Beadell Highway was then commenced, and was completed at Yamarna near Lake Yeo when it joined an existing track to Laverton in November 1962.

Beadell put considerable effort into rediscovering Vokes Hill while surveying the track, as a new device called a Tellurometer was being introduced. It used radio waves for distance measurement, and required elevated points for its operation.

==Fuel and supplies==
The track is suitable for only well-provisioned and experienced four-wheel drivers. There are no settlements between Coober Pedy and Laverton.

A roadhouse named Ilkurlka in Western Australia, opened in 2003, is west of the Western Australia – South Australian state border. It is at the intersection of the Madura Loongana Track (Aboriginal Business Road) and the Anne Beadell Highway. The roadhouse caters mainly for local Aboriginal communities and may be the most isolated roadhouse in Australia. There are no resupply stops on the journey between Ilkurlka and Coober Pedy.

==Places of interest==
Neale Junction, where the Anne Beadell Highway intersects with the Connie Sue Highway, another outback track constructed by Len Beadell, is west of Ilkurlka.

The track passes through the former British atomic test site of Emu Field, rabbit and dog fences, restricted nature conservation areas, and Aboriginal lands, all of which require permits to pass through.

Of interest is the wreck of a light aircraft near the track in Western Australia. The road passes through Mamungari Conservation Park in South Australia, which is one of Australia&#x27;s fourteen World Biosphere Reserves and the Tallaringa Conservation Park.

==Conditions==
Because the track is remote and not signposted, satellite navigation is advisable. For communication, high frequency radio or satellite telephone are recommended. In good conditions, it may take five days to complete the journey. Hazards such as flat tyres, breakdowns, and occasional flash floods must be taken into account.

<doc id="1251565" wikidata="Q924480" url="?curid=1251565" title="Moulin de la Galette">
<text>The Moulin de la Galette () is a windmill and associated businesses situated near the top of the district of Montmartre in Paris. Since the 17th century the windmill has been known for more than just its milling capabilities. Nineteenth-century owners and millers, the Debray family, made a brown bread galette, which became popular and was adopted as the name of the windmill and its businesses, which have included a famous guinguette and restaurant. In the 19th century, Le Moulin de la Galette represented diversion for Parisians seeking entertainment, a glass of wine and bread made from flour ground by the windmill. Artists such as Renoir, van Gogh, Ramón Casas and Pissarro have immortalized Le Moulin de la Galette, probably the most famous example being Renoir&#x27;s festive painting, &quot;Bal du moulin de la Galette&quot;.

==Windmill==

The windmill Moulin de la Galette, also known as Blute-fin, was built in 1622. The name Blute-fin comes from the French verb &quot;bluter&quot; which means sifting flour for the separation from bran.

The Debray family acquired the two mills in 1809 for producing flour, the Blute-fin and the Radet, built in 1717. But it was also used to pressurize the harvest or grind materials needed for manufacturing.

An association Friends of Old Montmartre saved it from destruction in 1915. In 1924, its owner moved the windmill to the corner of Girardon and Lepic streets. It was restored in 1978, but is not running. The windmill has been classified as a monument since 1958.

==Sieges in 1814 and 1870==
At the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1814, during the siege of Paris three Debray men lost their lives defending the windmill against Cossacks; the miller was killed and nailed to the wings of the windmill.

During the Franco-Prussian War Montmartre was attacked by 20,000 Prussian soldiers. During the siege, Pierre-Charles Debray was killed and nailed to the wings of the windmill. A mass grave for those killed during the siege was made just steps away from the Moulin de la Galette.

==Commercial expansion==
The mill was turned into a by the surviving son of the miller killed during the siege of Paris in 1814.
The current name Moulin de la Galette is based upon &quot;galette&quot;, a small brown bread that the Debray millers, who owned the mill in the 19th century, made and sold with a glass of milk. The tasty bread became so popular that it later became the name of the windmill. In 1830, they replaced milk with wine (especially the local Montmartre wine) and the windmill became a cabaret. Parisians made their way to Montmartre to enjoy &quot;the simple pleasures&quot; of the countryside with a glass of wine, freshly baked bread and a terrace view of Paris and the Seine below. In 1833, one of the Debrays decided to open an area for dancing, dedicated to the Greek muse Terpsichore. His flair for dancing and enthusiasm attracted patrons to the dancing hall and it became a success.

Author Émile Zola wrote in 1876, &quot;We rushed off into the countryside to celebrate the joy of not having to listen to any more talk about politics,&quot; which often meant reflection of France&#x27;s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. Montmartre, attainable by a train ride or a one-hour walk, was still a village with orchards, shops and two remaining windmills.

As the nearby fields were replaced with housing and factories, Nicholas Charles Debray sought commercial opportunities to remain a going concern. One of the windmills was turned into a viewing tower and a dance hall was opened adjacently. People came to the relaxed, popular Moulin de la Galette for entertainment and dancing.

Over its history, the building has experienced a wide range of uses: open-air cafe, music-hall, television studios and restaurant. It is now a private property. The windmill Radet, however, marks the entrance to a bistro named Le Moulin de la Galette.

==The windmill in art==
The area has been depicted by artists such as Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Ramon Casas, Paul François Quinsac, Kees van Dongen and Maurice Utrillo.

<text>In agriculture and gardening, transplanting or replanting is the technique of moving a plant from one location to another. Most often this takes the form of starting a plant from seed in optimal conditions, such as in a greenhouse or protected nursery bed, then replanting it in another, usually outdoor, growing location. The agricultural machine that does this is called a transplanter. This is common in market gardening and truck farming, where setting out or planting out are synonymous with transplanting. In the horticulture of some ornamental plants, transplants are used infrequently and carefully because they carry with them a significant risk of killing the plant. 

Transplanting has a variety of applications, including:
* Extending the growing season by starting plants indoors, before outdoor conditions are favorable;
* Protecting young plants from diseases and pests until they are sufficiently established;
* Avoiding germination problems by setting out seedlings instead of direct seeding.

Different species and varieties react differently to transplanting; for some, it is not recommended. In all cases, avoiding &quot;transplant shock&quot;—the stress or damage received in the process—is the principal concern. Plants raised in protected conditions usually need a period of acclimatization, known as hardening off (see also frost hardiness). Also, root disturbance should be minimized. The stage of growth at which transplanting takes place, the weather conditions during transplanting, and treatment immediately after transplanting are other important factors.

== Transplant production systems ==

Commercial growers employ what are called containerized and non-containerized transplant production.

Containerized transplants or plugs allow separately grown plants to be transplanted with the roots and soil intact. Typically grown in peat pots (a pot made of compressed peat), soil blocks (compressed blocks of soil), paper pots or multiple-cell containers such as plastic packs (four to twelve cells) or larger plug trays made of plastic or styrofoam.

Non-containerized transplants are typically grown in greenhouse ground beds or benches, outdoors in-ground with row covers and hotbeds, and in-ground in the open field. The plants are pulled with bare roots for transplanting, which are less-expensive than containerized transplants, but with lower yields due to poorer plant reestablishment.

==Containerized stock==
Containerized planting stock is classified by the type and size of container used. A great variety of containers has been used, with various degrees of success. Some containers are designed to be planted with the tree e.g., the tar paper pot, the Alberta peat sausage, the Walters square bullet, and paper pot systems, are filled with rooting medium and planted with the tree (Tinus and McDonald 1979). Also planted with the tree are other containers that are not filled with rooting medium, but in which the container is a molded block of growing medium, as with Polyloam, Tree Start, and BR-8 Blocks.

Designs of containers for raising planting stock have been many and various. Containerized white spruce stock is now the norm. Most containers are tube-like; both diameter and volume affect white spruce growth (Hocking and Mitchell 1975, Carlson and Endean 1976). White spruce grown in a container having a 1:1 height:diameter produced significantly greater dry weight than those in containers of 3:1 and 6:1 height:diameter configurations. Total dry weight and shoot length increased with increasing container volume.

The larger the bag the fewer deployed per unit area. However, the biological advantage of size has been enough to influence a pronounced swing towards larger containers in British Columbia (Coates et al. 1994). The number of PSB211 (2 cm top diameter, 11 cm long) styroblock plugs ordered in British Columbia decreased from 14,246,000 in 1981 to zero in 1990, while orders for PSB415 (4 cm top diameter, 15 cm long) styroblock plugs increased in the same period from 257 000 to 41 008 000, although large stock is more expensive than small to raise, distribute, and plant.

Other containers are not planted with the tree, e.g., Styroblock, Superblock, Copperblock, and Miniblock container systems, produce Styroplug seedlings with roots in a cohesive plug of growing medium. The plug cavities vary in volume by various combinations of top diameter and depth, from 39 to 3260 mL, but those most commonly used, at least in British Columbia, are in the range 39 mL to 133 mL (Van Eerden and Gates 1990). The BC-CFS Styroblock plug, developed in 1969/70, has become the dominant stock type for interior spruce in British Columbia (Van Eerden and Gates 1990, Coates et al. 1994). Plug sizes are indicated by a 3-figure designation, the 1st figure of which gives the top diameter and the other 2 figures the depth of the plug cavity, both dimensions approximations in centimetres. The demand for larger plugs has been increasing strongly (Table 6.24; Coates et al. 1994). Stock raised in some sizes of plug can vary in age class. In British Columbia, for example, PSB 415 and PSB 313 plugs are raised as 1+0 or 2+0. PSB 615 plugs are seldom raised other than as 2+0.

Initially, the intention was to leave the plugs in situ in the Styroblocks until immediately before planting. But this led to logistic problems and reduced the efficiency of planting operations. Studies to compare the performance of extracted, packaged stock versus &quot;in situ&quot; stock seem not to have been carried out, but packaged stock has performed well and given no indication of distress.

==Forestry==

===Field storage===

As advocated by Coates et al. (1994), thawed planting stock taken to the field should optimally be kept cool at 1 °C to 2 °C in relative humidities over 90% (Ronco 1972a). For a few days, storage temperatures around 4.5 °C and humidities about 50% can be tolerated. Binder and Fielder (1988) recommended that boxed seedlings retrieved from cold storage should not be exposed to temperatures above 10 °C. Refrigerator vans commonly used for transportation and on-site storage normally ‘maintain seedlings at 2 °C to 4 °C (Mitchell et al. 1980). Ronco (1972a, b) cautioned against using dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) to cool seedlings; he claimed that respiration and water transport in seedlings are disrupted by high concentrations of gaseous carbon dioxide.

Coniferous planting stock is often held in frozen storage, mostly at −2 °C, for extended periods and then cool-stored (+2 °C) to thaw the root plug prior to outplanting. Thawing is necessary if frozen seedlings cannot be separated from one another and has been advocated by some in order to avoid possible loss of contact between plug and soil with shrinkage of the plug with melting of ice in the plug. Physiological activity is also greater under cool rather than frozen storage, but seedlings of interior spruce and Engelmann spruce that were planted while still frozen had only brief and transient physiological effects, including xylem water potential, (Camm et al. 1995, Silem and Guy 1998). After 1 growing season, growth parameters did not differ between seedlings planted frozen and those planted thawed.

Studies of storage and planting practices have generally focussed on the effects of duration of frozen storage and the effects of subsequent cool storage (e.g., Ritchie et al. 1985, Chomba et al. 1993, Harper and Camm 1993). Reviews of colds storage techniques have paid little attention to the thawing process (Camm et al. 1994), or have merely noted that the rate of thawing is unlikely to cause damage (McKay 1997).

Kooistra and Bakker (2002) noted several lines of evidence suggesting that cool storage can have negative effects on seedling health. The rate of respiration is faster during cool storage than in frozen storage, so depleting carbohydrate reserves more rapidly. Certainly in the absence of light during cool storage, and to an indeterminate extent if seedlings are exposed to light (unusual), carbohydrate reserves are depleted (Wang and Zwiacek 1999). As well, Silem and Guy (1998), for instance, found that interior spruce seedlings had significantly lower total carbohydrate reserves if stored for 2 weeks at 2 °C than if thawed rapidly for 24 hours at 15 °C. Seedlings can rapidly lose cold hardiness in cool storage through increased respiration and consumption of intracellular sugars that function as cryoprotectants (Ogren 1997). Also, depletion of carbohydrate reserves impairs the ability of seedlings to make root growth. Finally, storage moulds are much more of a problem during cool than frozen storage.

Kooistra and Bakker (2002), therefore, tested the hypothesis that such thawing is unnecessary. Seedlings of 3 species, including interior spruce were planted with frozen root plugs (frozen seedlings) and with thawed root plugs (thawed seedlings). Thawed root plugs warmed to soil temperature in about 20 minutes; frozen root plugs took about 2 hours, ice in the plug having to melt before the temperature could rise above zero. Size of root plug influenced thawing time. These outplantings were into warm soil by boreal standards, and seedlings with frozen plugs might fare differently if outplanted into soil at temperatures more typical of planting sites in spring and at high elevations. Variable fluorescence did not differ between thawed and frozen seedlings. Bud break was no faster among thawed interior spruce seedlings than among frozen. Field performance did not differ between thawed and frozen seedlings.

<doc id="1251576" wikidata="Q1926288" url="?curid=1251576" title="Black Knights' Tango">
<text>The Black Knights&#x27; Tango (also known as the Mexican Defense, Two Knights&#x27; Tango or Kevitz–Trajkovic Defense) is a chess opening beginning with the moves:
:1. 
:2. 

This position can also be reached by transposition, for example 1.c4 Nf6, 1.d4 Nc6, or 1.c4 Nc6.
==History==
The opening originated in the 1920s, when it was played by both the Mexican grandmaster Carlos Torre (hence the name &quot;Mexican Defense&quot;) and the American master Alexander Kevitz (the &quot;Kevitz&quot; in &quot;Kevitz–Trajkovic Defense&quot;). Torre used it to defeat then-U.S. Chess Champion Frank James Marshall in only seven moves. It was later played by the Yugoslav master Mihailo Trajkovic and the Soviet grandmaster Anatoly Lutikov.

After decades of obscurity, the opening was revitalized by the International Master Georgi Orlov, who published a booklet and a book about it in 1992 and 1998, respectively. Orlov rechristened the opening the &quot;Black Knights&#x27; Tango&quot;.

Since 1992, the opening has been employed by a number of strong grandmasters, including Victor Bologan, Joel Benjamin, Larry Christiansen, and Alex Yermolinsky. Yermolinsky has even ventured it against Garry Kasparov.

==Basic ideas==
Although fairly uncommon, the &quot;Tango&quot; has a sounder positional basis than most other offbeat openings: Black quickly, has a flexible pawn structure, and is prepared to strike back in the center with 3...e5, or with ...e6 and ...d5. The opening has some distinct variations but it is highly transpositional, and may transpose to the King&#x27;s Indian Defense, Nimzo-Indian Defense, Bogo-Indian Defense, Chigorin Defense, Ragozin System, Catalan Opening, and English Opening.

==Possible continuations==

=== 3.Nf3 ===
The most common move, preventing 3...e5. Black usually responds with 3...e6, although 3...d6, intending a kind of Old Indian Defense, is also possible. After 3...e6, White can play 4.Nc3 Bb4 (transposing to the Nimzo-Indian Defense); 4.a3, when Black can either play 4...d5 (reaching a kind of Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined or Ragozin System), or 4...d6 preparing 5...e5 or even 5...g6 (&quot;championed by Bologan&quot;, according to Palliser), reaching a sort of King&#x27;s Indian Defense; or 4.g3, when Black can transpose to the Catalan Opening with 4...d5, recommended by Palliser or 4...Bb4+, preferred by Orlov, which transposes to a Nimzo-Indian after 5.Nc3, or to a Bogo-Indian Defense after 5.Bd2 or 5.Nbd2.

=== 3.Nc3 ===
This is White&#x27;s second-most popular move. After the thematic 3...e5, one possibility for White is 4.Nf3, transposing to an English Opening. Palliser recommends 4...e4 in response, while Orlov prefers 4...exd4 5.Nxd4 Bb4. Instead, the main line is 4.d5 Ne7. Now the game may continue in &quot;Tango&quot; fashion, for example with 5.Nf3 Ng6, or transpose to the King&#x27;s Indian Defense with, for example, 5.Nf3 d6 6.e4 (6.Bg5!?) g6 7.Be2 Bg7 8.0-0 0-0, reaching the main line of the King&#x27;s Indian by transposition.
Another interesting but relatively unexplored idea is 3...e6, allowing White to play 4.e4 (other moves such as 4.d5, 4.Bg5, 4.a3, 4.f3, and 4.Nf3 are also possible), whereupon Black follows up with 4...d5. From that position, the main possibilities are 5.e5 (the main line), 5.exd5, 5.cxd5, and 5.Bg5. These possibilities can also be reached via transposition from the Mikenas–Carls Variation of the English Opening (1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.e4), although if Black wishes to play this way, the optimal move order is 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nc6.

=== 3.d5 ===

This ambitious move is but rarely seen. Black normally responds with 3...Ne5. Then after 4.e4 (inviting 4...Nxe4 5.Qd4 winning a knight), Black struck back in the center with 4...Ng6 5.f4 e5 in the seminal game Sämisch–Torre, Moscow 1925. Orlov considers both Torre&#x27;s fourth and fifth moves inferior, however. He and Palliser both recommend 4...e6 instead, after which play can become extremely . For example, Elburg–Simmelink, correspondence 1999 continued 5.f4 Ng6 6.Bd3 exd5 7.e5 Ne4 8.cxd5 Qh4+ 9.g3 Bb4+! 10.Bd2 (Better is 10.Nc3 Nxc3! 11.bxc3 Bxc3+ 12.Bd2 Bxd2+ 13.Qxd2 Qe7 14.Nf3 d6 15.Bb5+! Kf8 16.Qc3 with some practical chances for the sacrificed pawn.) 10...Nxg3 11.Nf3 (&quot;first diagram&quot;) Nxf4! 12.Bf1! (12.Nxh4?? Nxd3!; 12.Bxb4? Nxd3+ 13.Qxd3 Qxb4+ is hopeless for White.) 12...Bxd2+ 13.Nbxd2 (&quot;second diagram&quot;; 13.Qxd2? Nxf1+ 14.Nxh4 Nxd2 is winning for Black.) Qh3! 14.Rg1 (White cannot take either of Black&#x27;s two hanging pieces: 14.Bxh3 Nd3#; 14.hxg3 Qxg3#. Nor is 14.Ng5 Qg2! any better.) 14...Nxf1 left Black with two extra pawns.

<doc id="1251589" wikidata="Q7995414" url="?curid=1251589" title="White Spot">
<text>White Spot is a Canadian restaurant chain based in Vancouver, British Columbia, best known for its hamburgers, Pirate Pak children&#x27;s meal, &quot;Triple O&quot; sauce, and milkshakes. Along with its related Triple O&#x27;s quick service brand, the chain operates over 100 locations in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Asia.

==History==

In the 1920s, White Spot&#x27;s founder, Nat Bailey, operated a travelling lunch counter in Vancouver, operating out of a 1918 Model T. He sold hotdogs for a dime and ice cream for a nickel. In 1928, Bailey founded the first White Spot restaurant. Initially, he had planned on naming the eatery the &quot;Granville Barbecue&quot;, but changed his mind instead taking the advice of a friend who suggested he name it White Spot after a restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, which was derived from LA’s own nickname at the time, the “White Spot of America,” which referred to LA’s relative prosperity and low unemployment in such things as buy-local campaigns, but was also used in racial terms, such as a “keep the white spot white” drive to keep non-whites from moving into a white neighborhood.

The first restaurant was located in the Marpole neighbourhood, at 67th and Granville Street, at what would become known as Granville House, in Vancouver, British Columbia. The restaurant was called &quot;White Spot Barbecue Sandwiches&quot;, evolving into a drive-in and dining room. By 1955, the chain was serving 10,000 cars a day and 110,000 customers a week.

By the 1990s, some White Spot drive-ins were phased out owing to an increase in the number of franchise restaurants and a gradual decrease in the popularity of drive-ins. Granville House was a popular dining spot until 1986 when a fire in the kitchen damaged the building. The restaurant closed permanently at that location shortly thereafter, despite some talk of rebuilding.

===Franchising and growth===
The chain was sold to General Foods in 1968 when Bailey retired. In 1982, White Spot returned to local ownership when the company was purchased by BC businessman Peter Toigo, becoming part of Shato Holdings Limited. After his death in 1993, his sons Peter and Ron Toigo took over ownership.

In 1986, the chain was sued in the court case &quot;Gee v. White Spot&quot;. The plaintiffs, Mr. Gee and Mr. and Mrs. Pan, claimed damages for botulism poisoning related to a beef dip sandwich. The decision made it easier for diners to sue restaurants for breach of contract and implied warranty instead of the harder-to-prove negligence (Canadian tort law expressly disavows strict product liability).

In 1993, White Spot introduced franchising, and in 1997 it launched its Triple O&#x27;s quick service brand, which is named after White Spot&#x27;s trademark hamburger sauce. Since 1999, the company&#x27;s franchises have been installed on some ships in the BC Ferries fleet. By the 2000s, the chain was opening burger-focused takeouts at its Triple O&#x27;s locations.

In 2012, 64 White Spot restaurants and 62 Triple O&#x27;s locations served 17 million customers and generated $200 million in gross revenues.

Chef Chuck Currie has been featured in marketing campaigns alongside guest celebrity chefs hailing from Vancouver, including John Bishop, Rob Feenie, Umberto Menghi, and Melissa Craig.

In 2020, White Spot reached an expanded agreement with gas station operator Parkland Corporation, which already operated select Triple O&#x27;s locations in B.C., mainly at Chevron-branded stations. Under the new agreement, Triple O&#x27;s expanded into Alberta and Ontario through new locations at additional Parkland-owned stations.

==International locations==

The company opened its first international location across the nearby United States border in Bellingham, Washington, in 1993 with plans to continue expanding in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. The Bellingham location closed three years later due to financial issues and low traffic attributed to a weak Canadian dollar.

Abroad, White Spot has expanded its Triple O&#x27;s chain into Hong Kong in the early 2000s and, more recently, Bangkok, Singapore, Manila, and Mainland China. In Hong Kong, four such stores can be found at the basement of Pacific Place, and in Exchange Square, on the Hong Kong Island; and at Cooked Deli in the Harbour City shopping mall in Kowloon and in Shatin. The three Hong Kong franchises each record more than twice as many sales as the average location in BC.

A location in Seoul, South Korea, opened in September 2008. It is located near Dosan Park, in the Apgujeong neighbourhood.

<doc id="1251593" wikidata="Q1939271" url="?curid=1251593" title="Pinus kesiya">
<text>Pinus kesiya (Khasi pine, Benguet pine or three-needled pine) is one of the most widely distributed pines in Asia. Its range extends south and east from the Khasi Hills in the northeast Indian state of Meghalaya, to northern Thailand, Philippines, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, southernmost China, and Vietnam. It is an important plantation species elsewhere in the world, including in southern Africa and South America.

The common name &quot;Khasi pine&quot; is from the Khasi hills in India, and &quot;Benguet pine&quot; is from the landlocked province of Benguet in Luzon, Philippines, where it is the dominant species of the Luzon tropical pine forests (known as &quot;saleng&quot; in Ilocano). The Benguet pine is sometimes treated as a separate species, Pinus insularis; however, the current opinion is to treat these as conspecific with &quot;P. kesiya&quot;. The city of Baguio is nicknamed &quot;The City of Pines&quot;, as it is noted for large stands of this tree.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus kesiya&quot; is a tree reaching up to tall with a straight, cylindrical trunk. The bark is thick and dark brown, with deep longitudinal fissures. The branches are robust, red brown from the second year, the branchlets horizontal to drooping. The leaves are needle-like, dark green, usually 3 per fascicle, long, the fascicle sheath long and persistent. The cones are ovoid, long, often curved downwards, sometimes slightly distorted; the scales of second-year cones are dense, the umbo a little convex, sometimes acutely spinous. The scales have transverse and longitudinal ridges across the middle of the scale surface. The seeds are winged, long with a 1.5–2.5 cm wing. Pollination occurs in mid-spring, with the cones maturing 18–20 months after.

Khasi pine usually grows in pure stands or mixed with broad-leaved trees, but does not form open pine forests.

==Uses==
The soft and light timber of &quot;Pinus kesiya&quot; can be used for a wide range of applications, including boxes, paper pulp, and temporary electric poles. It is intensely used for timber, both sourced in natural forests and plantations.

The good-quality resin is not abundant and has not been much used except during the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines for the production of turpentine.

<doc id="1251596" wikidata="Q1414671" url="?curid=1251596" title="Wild mouse">
<text>A wild mouse is a type of roller coaster consisting of single or spinning cars traversing a tight-winding track with an emphasis on sharp, unbanked turns. The upper portion of the track usually features multiple 180-degree turns, known as flat turns, that produce high lateral G-forces even at modest speeds. Cars are often designed to be wider than the track to enhance the illusion of hanging over the edge. Lower portions of the track typically feature small hills and bunny hops. Wild mouse coasters first appeared in the 1950s, and following a period of decline in the 1980s, new innovations and layout designs in the late 1990s led to a resurgence in demand.

==History==
During the 1950s, wild mouse roller coasters began to appear at amusement parks and traveling fairs throughout the United States. One of the earliest manufacturers, B.A. Schiff &amp; Associates, made over 70 beginning as early as 1950. The company was founded by Ben Schiff in what is believed to be 1947, and it ceased operation in 1960 following an acquisition. Schiff offered two general models – one for stationary parks and a smaller, portable model for traveling fairs. None of the rides produced by the company remain in operation.

The modern Wild Mouse was invented by German designer Franz Mack. In the original wooden Wild Mouse coasters of the 1960s and 1970s, the cars were so small that they could only fit two adults in close contact. While the low capacity of these rides led to long lines, the cars were small by design.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the Wild Mouse-type roller coaster was nearly extinct. However, beginning in the mid-1990s, Wild Mouse-style rides made a comeback for two reasons: first, they were cheaper than larger, conventional coasters; second, they added to a park&#x27;s &quot;coaster count&quot; with minimal impact on cost and area.

<text>In mathematical logic, the Mostowski collapse lemma, also known as the Shepherdson–Mostowski collapse, is a theorem of set theory introduced by and .

==Statement==
Suppose that &quot;R&quot; is a binary relation on a class &quot;X&quot; such that
*&quot;R&quot; is set-like: &quot;R&quot;−1[&quot;x&quot;] = {&quot;y&quot; : &quot;y&quot; &quot;R&quot; &quot;x&quot;} is a set for every &quot;x&quot;,
*&quot;R&quot; is well-founded: every nonempty subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;X&quot; contains an &quot;R&quot;-minimal element (i.e. an element &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot; such that &quot;R&quot;−1[&quot;x&quot;] ∩ &quot;S&quot; is empty),
*&quot;R&quot; is extensional: &quot;R&quot;−1[&quot;x&quot;] ≠ &quot;R&quot;−1[&quot;y&quot;] for every distinct elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; of &quot;X&quot;
The Mostowski collapse lemma states that for every such &quot;R&quot; there exists a unique transitive class (possibly proper) whose structure under the membership relation is isomorphic to (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;R&quot;), and the isomorphism is unique. The isomorphism maps each element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;X&quot; to the set of images of elements &quot;y&quot; of &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;y R x&quot; (Jech 2003:69).

==Generalizations==
Every well-founded set-like relation can be embedded into a well-founded set-like extensional relation. This implies the following variant of the Mostowski collapse lemma: every well-founded set-like relation is isomorphic to set-membership on a (non-unique, and not necessarily transitive) class.

A mapping &quot;F&quot; such that &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = {&quot;F&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) : &quot;y R x&quot;} for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; can be defined for any well-founded set-like relation &quot;R&quot; on &quot;X&quot; by well-founded recursion. It provides a homomorphism of &quot;R&quot; onto a (non-unique, in general) transitive class. The homomorphism &quot;F&quot; is an isomorphism if and only if &quot;R&quot; is extensional.

The well-foundedness assumption of the Mostowski lemma can be alleviated or dropped in non-well-founded set theories. In Boffa&#x27;s set theory, every set-like extensional relation is isomorphic to set-membership on a (non-unique) transitive class. In set theory with Aczel&#x27;s anti-foundation axiom, every set-like relation is bisimilar to set-membership on a unique transitive class, hence every bisimulation-minimal set-like relation is isomorphic to a unique transitive class.

==Application==
Every set model of ZF is set-like and extensional. If the model is well-founded, then by the Mostowski collapse lemma it is isomorphic to a transitive model of ZF and such a transitive model is unique.

Saying that the membership relation of some model of ZF is well-founded is stronger than saying that the axiom of regularity is true in the model. There exists a model &quot;M&quot; (assuming the consistency of ZF) whose domain has a subset &quot;A&quot; with no &quot;R&quot;-minimal element, but this set &quot;A&quot; is not a &quot;set in the model&quot; (&quot;A&quot; is not in the domain of the model, even though all of its members are). More precisely, for no such set &quot;A&quot; there exists &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot; such that &quot;A&quot; = &quot;R&quot;−1[&quot;x&quot;]. So &quot;M&quot; satisfies the axiom of regularity (it is &quot;internally&quot; well-founded) but it is not well-founded and the collapse lemma does not apply to it.

<text>Keith Blair (born 31 March 1976), better known by the stage name Anthony B, is a Jamaican DJ and member of the Rastafari movement.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Blair grew up in rural Clark&#x27;s Town in the northwestern parish of Trelawny in Jamaica. His deeply religious family life (his mother was a Seventh-day Adventist and his grandmother a Revivalist) imbued him with a profound spirituality. During his youth, his favourite singers were reggae legends Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, musicians who strongly influenced his own style. Peter Tosh&#x27;s influence can definitely be heard in Anthony B&#x27;s vocal delivery and revolutionary stance.

Anthony B adopted Rastafari movement beliefs as a teenager, a decision which was not well received by his family. The stubborn and determined Anthony B refused to give up his new religion and his dreadlocks and moved to the home of his aunt and uncle in the Kingston suburb, Portmore. He is a member of the Bobo Ashanti branch of the movement. &quot;Bobo Dreads&quot;, as they are known, are recognisable by their long robes and turbans. The strong Afrocentric pride and the other Rastafarian beliefs (or &quot;overstandings&quot; as Rastafarians prefer to call them) are reflected in his songs.

===Career===
While attending high school, Anthony B debuted as a deejay for the local sound system, Shaggy Hi-Power. In 1988, he befriended reggae artists such as Determine, Mega Banton, Ricky General and Terror Fabulous.

At this point in the reggae industry, singing &quot;slack&quot; songs about women was the popular thing to do. Anthony B did not believe in degrading women and chose to pen politically slanted songs instead. He collaborated with Little Devon and made his debut single &quot;The Living is Hard&quot; on the Wizard label in 1993. Anthony B tried many different producers before joining with Richard Bell, creating hits such as &quot;Fire Pon Rome&quot;, &quot;Raid Di Barn&quot;, &quot;Rumour&quot;, and &quot;Repentance Time&quot;. In late 1997, Anthony B released &quot;Universal Struggle&quot;, followed by a large number of albums since including 1999&#x27;s &quot;Seven Seals,&quot; 2003&#x27;s &quot;Street Knowledge&quot;, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Untouchable&quot; which featured collaborations with artists including Wyclef Jean, Snoop Dogg &amp; Bone Crusher, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Black Star&quot; plus &quot;My Hope,&quot; and more recently, &quot;Life Over Death&quot; (2008).

In January 2013, he was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute after being stopped in Georgia, United States due to illegally tinted windows in the vehicle in which he was travelling; He subsequently had to cancel several shows in South America as he was not allowed to travel outside the US. Charges were later dropped. {https://www.dancehallusa.com/anthony-b-weed-charge-dropped/}

In July 2013 he released &quot;Tribute to Legends&quot;, an album of cover versions of songs by artists such as Bob Marley, The Maytals, John Lennon, Ray Charles, Elvis Presley, and Ini Kamoze; Speaking of the album, he stated &quot;I chose to make a tribute album to firstly show how much these legends influence my music and my life.&quot; In 2016, Anthony B released Tears Of Luv on his label Born Fire Music and collaborated with various producer around the world including Evidence Music on his track Life Good.

In May 2020, Anthony B released his 20th studio album titled, &quot;King In My Castle&quot;.

Anthony B tours extensively in Europe and North America. He has collaborated with many singer-songwriters and producers 

Talking of his faith and music, Anthony B commented, &quot;When we say &#x27;burn fire&#x27; we don&#x27;t mean take a match and light somebody, we are saying get rid of these things that are no good for humanity.&quot;

<text>Brian Coburn (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He sat in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2003, representing the riding of Carleton—Gloucester (renamed as Ottawa—Orléans) for the Progressive Conservative Party. Coburn was a cabinet minister in the government of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.

He is not to be confused with the person of the same name who represents the same area on the Ottawa-Carleton Catholic School Board.

==Background==
Coburn was educated at Brock University in St. Catharines. A small businessman, he served for ten years as the Mayor of Cumberland. Coburn also served on the Board of Governors for Algonquin College in Ottawa. As mayor, he earned a reputation for fiscal prudence.

==Politics==
Coburn was elected for Carleton—Gloucester in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal Ren Danis by over 6,000 votes. This was considered a major upset. The riding had been solidly Liberal for many years, and most observers thought Danis would win an easy victory. Coburn&#x27;s win may be attributed to personal popularity and a local issue: many residents saw construction workers from Quebec as a threat to local employment, and voted Tory to protest the situation.

After sitting as a backbencher for two years, Coburn was appointed to the government of Mike Harris as Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs on February 8, 2001.

In 2002, Coburn endorsed Ernie Eves to succeed Mike Harris as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. When Eves became Premier on April 15, 2002, he named Coburn Associate Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing with Responsibility for Rural Affairs. On February 25, 2003, Coburn was moved to the Minister of Tourism and Recreation.

Coburn carried the banner of an increasingly unpopular party into the 2003 provincial election. The presence of Quebec workers was no longer an issue, and many local residents were angered by increased energy rates under the Harris and Eves governments. Despite gaining endorsements from several local newspapers, Coburn lost to Liberal Phil McNeely, another municipal politician, by about 4,500 votes.

In 2004, he endorsed Frank Klees for the leadership of the Ontario PC Party.

==Later life==
Coburn was appointed as a Citizenship Judge for Ottawa, Ontario in October 2006. Brian Coburn Boulevard, an arterial road in Orleans, is named after him.

Gromov&#x27;s father, Mikhail Konstantinovich Gromov, was of noble intelligentsia and served as military medic. His mother, Lyubov Ignatyevna Andreeva, was from peasant family and received training as an obstetrician. Gromov spent his childhood in Kaluga, Rzhev, Myza-Raevo (near Moscow). He graduated from Voskresensky Real School in Moscow, and went on to study at the IMTS from 1916 to 1917. In 1917, Gromov graduated from aviation theoretical courses at IMTS and started his army service.

== Career ==

=== Institutional positions ===
Upon graduation, Gromov served as a flight instructor and military pilot. In 1923, he won the Soviet championship in weightlifting. In 1925, he started working as a test pilot for the Air Force Research Institute testing the planes designed by Andrei Tupolev and Nikolai Polikarpov. From 1930 to 1941, Gromov then worked at the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute and became chief-pilot.

From March to August 1941, Gromov was the first director of the Flight Research Institute, a flight research and testing centre in Zhukovsky. The name of M. M. Gromov was awarded to the institute in 1991 to celebrate the Institute&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

After the war, Gromov was deputy commander of the Long-Range Aviation from 1946 to 1949. Later, till 1955, he was head of Department of flight service of Ministry of Aviation Industry. In 1955 he was discharged.

From 1937 to 1946, Gromov was deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (1st convocation).

In late 1940, he initiated the establishment of the Fedotov Test Pilot School.

=== Testing history ===
Gromov was involved in extensive testing and promotion of Russian airplanes throughout Europe and Asia. For example, from June to September 1925, Gromov flew the Polikarpov R-1 in the long-haul group flight of nine aeroplanes on the route Moscow-Beijing-Tokyo. A year later, in 1926, Gromov completed a European promotional flight in a Tupolev ANT-3 on the route Moscow-Königsberg-Berlin-Paris-Rome-Vienna-Prague-Warsaw-Moscow. Notably, on 25 April 1927, he made the first Soviet parachute jump out of a Polikarpov I-1 in a testing that involved the plane having entered into an unrecoverable spin. 

From 10 to 12 September 1934, Gromov, A. I. Filin, and I. T. Spirin made a record closed-circle non-stop flight on the route Moscow-Ryazan-Kharkov in a Tupolev ANT-25, flying in 75 hours. Gromov was subsequently awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for this feat.

In July 1937, Gromov, Andrey Yumashev, and Sergey Danilin a new non-stop flight distance record of from Moscow to San Jacinto, California, via the North Pole in a Tupolev ANT-25.

=== Service in World War II ===
During World War II, Gromov took command of several units:

* From December 1941 to February 1942, Gromov was commander of 31st Mixed Aviation Division (Kalinin Front).
*From February to May 1942, he was commander of the Air Force of Kalinin Front.
*From May 1942 to May 1943, he took command of the 3rd Air Army.
*From May 1943 to June 1944, he was commander of the 1st Air Army.
*From 1944 to 1946, Gromov was head of the Main Department of combat training of frontline aviation of the Air Force.

== Miscellaneous ==
From 1959 to 1961, Gromov headed the Weightlifting Federation of USSR. 

Gromov used his influence and renown to attain reconsideration of Sergei Korolev&#x27;s case, which resulted in Korolev&#x27;s transfer from the prison camp at Kolyma to TsKB-29.

Gromov lived in Moscow. Gromov&#x27;s wife, Nina Georgievna Gromova (1922–2019), was an equestrian sportswoman.

<text>Douglas Patrick Warren (born March 18, 1981, in Palatine, Illinois) is an American former soccer goalkeeper, who last played for the New England Revolution in Major League Soccer, in 2008. He was a member of the U.S. team at the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship.

==Youth==
Warren attended William Fremd High School where he was a Parade Magazine High School All American. He began his college soccer career at Indiana University, where he played in 1999. After his freshman season, Warren transferred to Clemson, where he emerged as one of the best goalkeepers in the NCAA. Named first team All-ACC all three years at Clemson, Warren was named a first team All-American as a senior in 2002, as he helped the Tigers to the Elite Eight.

In 2001, Warren was on the roster of the U.S. U-20 national team at the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship. Beginning in 2002, he began playing with the U.S. U-23 national team as it prepared for the 2004 Summer Olympic qualification campaign.

==Professional==
Following his senior season, Warren was drafted 14th overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by D.C. United. A reserve for much of the year, Warren was forced into action late in the season when starter Nick Rimando suffered a season-ending ACL injury. Warren started the season&#x27;s last five regular season games and both their playoff games, and although he impressed, failed to win a game.

In 2004, Warren again found himself as a backup to Rimando. However, shortly into the season, a string of mediocre performances by Rimando led Peter Nowak to give Warren another opportunity to seize the starting position. Warren started only one game, however, a loss in which he surrendered three goals, before being replaced again by rookie Troy Perkins. Perkins impressed enough to earn the starting job, and Warren was released soon thereafter. He spent the rest of the season with the New England Revolution, as an injury replacement for the injured Adin Brown. The Revolution acquired him for good after the season. He spent 2005 behind Matt Reis, making two appearances. Due to the consistency of Reis, Warren did not appear in MLS play in 2006 or 2007, although he remained the Revolution&#x27;s second-choice keeper.

<doc id="1251621" wikidata="Q2422798" url="?curid=1251621" title="Albert Belle">
<text>Albert Jojuan Belle (born August 25, 1966), formerly known as Joey Belle, is an American former Major League Baseball outfielder who played from 1989 to 2000, most notably for the Cleveland Indians. Known for his taciturn personality and intimidating stature, Belle was one of the leading sluggers of his time, and in 1995 became the only player to ever hit 50 doubles and 50 home runs in a season, despite the season being only 144 games. He was also the first player to break the $10 million per year compensation contract in Major League Baseball.

Belle was a five-time All-Star and Silver Slugger. He retired with a .295 career batting average, and averaged 37 home runs and 120 runs batted in (RBI) per season between 1991 and 2000. He is one of only 11 players in MLB history to have nine consecutive 100-RBI seasons.

==Early life==
Albert and his fraternal twin, Terry, were born on August 25, 1966, in Shreveport, Louisiana, the son of Albert Belle Sr., a high school baseball and football coach, and Carrie Belle, a former math teacher. He attained the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. Belle attended Huntington High School in Shreveport, where he was a star baseball and football player, a member of the National Honor Society and vice president of the local Future Business Leaders of America. He graduated sixth in his high school class and made the all-state baseball team twice. In 1984, he was selected to play for the US in the Junior Olympics, in which the U.S. won a silver medal. He played outfield and pitched, winning one game. After graduation, Belle accepted a baseball scholarship to Louisiana State University.

==College==

Belle played college baseball at Louisiana State University from 1985 to 1987, where he made 1st team All-SEC in 1986 and 1987 and played in 184 games, with 585 at bats, 194 hits, 30 doubles, 49 home runs, 172 RBI, 157 runs, a .670 slugging percentage, and a .332 batting average. In 1986, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Chatham A&#x27;s and was named a league all-star, then returned to the league in 1987 to play for the Hyannis Mets.

In his junior year, he was batting .349 before an incident involving a heckler insulting him with racial epithets at an SEC Tournament game led to a suspension that kept him out of the College World Series.

After college, Belle was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the second round (47th overall) of the 1987 Major League Baseball draft.

==Major League career summary==
Belle made his major league debut on July 15, 1989, going 1-for-4 with one RBI in a 7–1 win against the Texas Rangers. He recorded an RBI single off Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan in his first career at bat. On July 19, Belle hit his first major league home run and went 2-for-4, helping Cleveland to a 10–1 victory over the Minnesota Twins. He ultimately played in 62 games during his first season, batting .225 with seven home runs and 37 RBI.

Belle became the fourth player to have eight straight seasons of 30 home runs and 100 RBI, joining Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx and Lou Gehrig (a feat since matched by Albert Pujols, Rafael Palmeiro, Manny Ramirez and Alex Rodriguez). He was an accomplished baserunner, with a career-high 23 steals in 1993, and 17 steals in 1999 despite hip problems that plagued him late in his career. He led the league three times in RBIs, three times in total bases, three times in extra-base hits and twice in slugging. He was a five-time All-Star between 1993 and 1997. He had a strong throwing arm, and was a gifted pitcher in high school. His range factor by games played was consistently higher than the major league average at that position; nevertheless, he still managed to accrue a -63 &quot;Total Zone Runs&quot; during 12 major league seasons.

Belle&#x27;s career highs in home runs, RBIs, batting average, runs scored and walks occurred in five separate seasons. In 2006, the &quot;Hardball Times&quot; published a statistical comparison of Belle&#x27;s career statistics with that of 60 of his current and former peers. The article ranked him in career &quot;prime value&quot;, behind Hall of Famers Ralph Kiner and Frank Thomas.

In 1992, Belle would have become one of only five players in MLB history to hit a home run over the left-field roof of Detroit&#x27;s Tiger Stadium (joining Harmon Killebrew, Frank Howard, Cecil Fielder and Mark McGwire). However, the ball struck a light tower on top of the roof and fell back into the stands.

In 1994, Belle lost the batting title to New York Yankees outfielder Paul O&#x27;Neill, .359 to .357. In 1995, Belle became the first player in major league history to hit 50 home runs and 50 doubles in the same season; the last player before him to reach as many as 40 in both categories had been Willie Stargell in 1973. The achievement was more impressive because Belle played only 143 games in 1995 due to a season shortened by the previous year&#x27;s player strike. 

Belle&#x27;s surly reputation and disdain of the media cost him votes for the 1995 MVP Award. He finished second in the voting to the Boston Red Sox&#x27; Mo Vaughn even though he led the American League that season in runs scored, home runs, RBI, slugging percentage and total bases, and outpaced Vaughn head-to-head in every important offensive category except RBI (both men had 126); both players&#x27; teams reached the playoffs. This was in the middle of a three-year streak in which Belle finished third, second and third for the American League MVP. Belle had two other top ten MVP finishes, in 1993 (seventh) and 1998 (eighth).

On November 19, 1996, Belle signed a five-year, $55million (equivalent to $million today) deal with the Chicago White Sox as a free agent. This contract made him the highest-paid player in baseball for a brief period and the first player in baseball history to make $10 million in a season. He enjoyed two great seasons in Chicago, including a career-high 27-game hitting streak in May 1997, and came close to another 50/50 season in 1998 with 49 home runs (a White Sox team record that still stands) and 48 doubles. He also drove in 152 runs to break Zeke Bonura&#x27;s single-season franchise record of 138 in 1936 (to date, the RBI total also remains a White Sox single-season record). Additionally, when Cal Ripken Jr. ended his record consecutive game streak at 2,632 in September 1998, it was Belle who took over as the major leagues&#x27; active leader in the category (his streak of 392 consecutive games ended the next year due to a perceived lack of hustle viewed by his manager).

Belle&#x27;s contract with the White Sox had an unusual clause allowing him to demand that he would remain one of the three highest-paid players in baseball. In October 1998, he invoked the clause, and when the White Sox declined to give him a raise he immediately became a free agent. He again became the game&#x27;s highest-paid player, signing a five-year, $65million ($million today) deal with the Baltimore Orioles on December 1, 1998. However, his career ended just two seasons later when he was forced into retirement at age 34 by degenerative hip osteoarthritis. He was kept on Baltimore&#x27;s active 40-man roster for the next three years as a condition of the insurance policy which largely reimbursed the Orioles for the remainder of his contract.

Belle homered in the final at-bat of his major-league career, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards on October 1, 2000.

In 1,539 games over 12 seasons, Belle posted a .295 batting average (1,726-for-5,853) with 974 runs, 389 doubles, 21 triples, 381 home runs, 1,239 RBI, 88 stolen bases, 683 bases on balls, .369 on-base percentage and .564 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .976 fielding percentage playing at left and right field. In 18 postseason games, he hit .230 (14-for-61) with 10 runs, two doubles, six home runs, 14 RBI, one stolen base and 14 walks.

==Personal problems==
In 1990, the Indians sent Belle to the Cleveland Clinic for two months for alcoholism rehabilitation. Belle was suspended in 1994 for using a corked bat, resulting in a seven-game suspension. The incident gained further notoriety when teammate Jason Grimsley crawled through the building&#x27;s ceiling panels to break into the locked umpires&#x27; dressing room where he replaced Belle&#x27;s corked bat with a teammate&#x27;s bat. The revelation of Belle&#x27;s use of corked bats was later given more emphasis when Cleveland teammate Omar Vizquel wrote in his 2002 autobiography that it would be naive to suggest otherwise, and that &quot;all of Albert&#x27;s bats were corked.&quot;

Belle was fined in 1996 for knocking down Brewers infielder Fernando Viña, who had blocked his way between bases.

A profane outburst directed at a group of reporters in his team&#x27;s dugout, including NBC Sports personality Hannah Storm, was widely reported during the 1995 World Series. He was unrepentant afterward: &quot;The Indians wanted me to issue a statement of regret when the fine was announced, but I told them to take it out. I apologize for nothing.&quot;

Eventually, Belle routinely refused to speak with the media whatsoever, explaining that players like Steve Carlton also did not interview and that he preferred to concentrate on baseball.

Buster Olney wrote about his outbursts as a member of the Cleveland Indians:
:It was taken as fact in baseball circles that Albert Belle was nuts... He slurped coffee constantly and seemed to be in a perpetual caffeinated frenzy. Few escaped his wrath: on some days he would destroy the postgame buffet ... launching plates into the shower, and after one poor at-bat against Boston, he retreated to the visitors&#x27; clubhouse and took a bat to teammate Kenny Lofton&#x27;s boombox. Belle preferred to have the clubhouse cold, below 60 degrees, and when one chilly teammate turned up the heat, Belle walked over, turned down the thermostat and smashed it with his bat. His nickname, thereafter, was &quot;Mr. Freeze.&quot; ... The Indians billed him $10,000 a year for the damage he caused in clubhouses on the road and at home, and tolerated his behavior only because he was an awesome slugger...

In 2001, following his retirement, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;&#x27; columnist Bill Madden wrote:
:Sorry, there&#x27;ll be no words of sympathy here for Albert Belle. He was a surly jerk before he got hurt and now he&#x27;s a hurt surly jerk...He was no credit to the game. Belle&#x27;s boorish behavior should be remembered by every member of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association when it comes time to consider him for the Hall of Fame.
In his first year of Hall of Fame eligibility (2006), he garnered only 7.7% of the baseball writers&#x27; votes, missing election by an extremely wide margin. However, his vote total was high enough to keep his name on the ballot for the following year. In 2007, he received only 19 votes (3.5%), knocking him off the ballot.

In retirement, Belle had his first encounter with the Cleveland Indians since leaving the club in 1996, during their 2012 spring training in Goodyear, Arizona and was joined by former teammates Kenny Lofton, Sandy Alomar Jr., and Carlos Baerga. In spite of this, Belle declined both to attend the 20th anniversary celebration of the 1995 World Series team in 2015 and the 2016 ceremony when he was inducted into the Indians team Hall of Fame.

==Legal troubles==
In October 1995, Belle&#x27;s house in Euclid, Ohio was egged by teenagers after he turned away trick-or-treaters on Halloween. Belle chased one of the trick-or-treaters in his car. Belle was fined $100 for reckless operation of a vehicle. The guardian of the teenager later sued Belle for $850,000 contending that Belle&#x27;s car had bumped into the teenager. The lawsuit was settled in 1997.

In 2006, Belle was sentenced to 90 days in jail and five years&#x27; probation after he admitted to stalking his former girlfriend.

On March 25, 2018, Belle was arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona and charged with indecent exposure and DUI. All charges were dismissed the following month.

<doc id="1251624" wikidata="Q7437434" url="?curid=1251624" title="Scott Vallow">
<text>Scott Vallow (born June 8, 1977, in Modesto, California) is a retired American soccer goalkeeper, most famously for playing with the Rochester Rhinos, 2005–2010. Scott was the assistant coach of the North Carolina Courage soccer team, having followed head coach Paul Riley from the Portland Thorns FC to Western New York Flash and the Courage. He was relieved from his duties on November 19, 2021.

==Career==
===College===
Vallow played college soccer at Bowling Green from 1995 to 1998, where he started all 85 games the team played during his tenure, amassing a .70 goals against average during his career. Vallow, alongside teammate Steve Klein, led Bowling Green to the &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; of the NCAA Championships in both 1995 and 1996.

===Professional===
Upon graduating, Vallow was signed to a Project-40 contract with Major League Soccer, for the express purpose of playing goalkeeper for the league&#x27;s USL A-League affiliate. Although he was allocated to the Dallas Burn in August 1999, he saw no time for the team, and was released after the 1999 season. Vallow then signed a contract with the Rochester Raging Rhinos, and immediately took hold of the starting position. Vallow&#x27;s excellent play helped lead the Rhinos to the 2000 championship, and also resulted in his being named the A-League Goalkeeper of the Year. Vallow returned to the Rhinos in 2001, and his performance was integral in the team winning a second consecutive A-League Championship.

Vallow spent the 2002 season shuttling between the USL and MLS, as he was signed and released by both the New England Revolution and the Dallas Burn; Vallow also played for the Rhinos, making eight appearances and sharing duties with Pat Onstad. Following the 2002 season, Vallow finally made a more permanent move up to the first division, being signed by the Colorado Rapids; although he was with the team for two years, Vallow was employed largely as a backup to Scott Garlick and then Joe Cannon. Vallow played in only four games during his two years with the team. He re-signed with the Rhinos after the 2004 MLS season, where he was the number one keeper, team captain, and fan favorite, announced on the pitch with the &quot;Superman&quot; theme playing at every home game. On October 20, 2009, Vallow extended his contract with the Rhinos for another 2 years. However, he would announce his retirement after only one year, in January 2011, choosing to focus on being an assistant coach for the Western New York Flash of Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer.

===Coaching===
Vallow remained an assistant coach of the Flash through the tenure of Flash head coach Aaran Lines, his former Rochester Rhinos teammate, until the end of the team&#x27;s inaugural National Women&#x27;s Soccer League season in 2013. Vallow began dating Flash midfielder McCall Zerboni, left the Flash, and became an assistant coach of the Rochester Rhinos in 2014.

However, in 2015 the Flash traded Zerboni to Portland Thorns FC. The Thorns were coached by Paul Riley at the time, and Riley also hired Vallow to join the Thorns&#x27; staff as an assistant. Vallow then followed RIley back to Western New York when Riley was dismissed by Portland at the end of the 2015 season and subsequently hired by the Flash in 2016. (Portland traded Zerboni to the Boston Breakers before the 2016 season, and Boston traded her back to the Flash mid-season.)

In 2016, Vallow managed the team whenever Riley was suspended by officials, which occurred three times during the 2016 season, including most of the team&#x27;s 2016 semi-finals match against Portland Thorns FC, the entirety of the 2016 NWSL Championship match, and the 2017 NWSL season opener. Vallow himself was ejected during the Courage&#x27;s May 27, 2017, match against the Chicago Red Stars.

Following the 2021 NWSL abuse scandal involving Riley, Vallow remained on the Courage&#x27;s coaching staff as an assistant to interim head coach Sean Nahas. However, Vallow was relieved of his duties as assistant coach on November 19, 2021, following what the club described as &quot;individual evaluations and performance-based reviews&quot; of its technical staff.

==Personal life==
As of October 2016, Vallow was engaged to Western New York Flash midfielder McCall Zerboni. Vallow and Zerboni had to change plans to marry in October when the Flash reached the 2016 NWSL Championship match, also in October. Vallow and Zerboni own a home together in Portland, Oregon.

<doc id="1251625" wikidata="Q690489" url="?curid=1251625" title="Siege of Paris (1870–1871)">
<text>The siege of Paris took place from 19 September 1870 to 28 January 1871 and ended in the capture of the city by forces of the various states of the North German Confederation, led by the Kingdom of Prussia. The siege was the culmination of the Franco-Prussian War, which saw the Second French Empire attempt to reassert its dominance over continental Europe by declaring war on the North German Confederation. The Prussian-dominated North German Confederation had recently emerged victorious in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, which led to the questioning of France&#x27;s status as the dominant power of continental Europe. With a declaration of war by the French parliament on 16 July 1870, Imperial France soon faced a series of defeats at German hands over the following months, leading to the Battle of Sedan, which, on 2 September 1870, saw a decisive defeat of French forces and the capture of the French emperor, Napoleon III.

With the capture of Napoleon III, the Second French Empire collapsed and the Third French Republic was declared, provisionally led by the Government of National Defense. Despite German forces reaching and besieging Paris by 19 September 1870, the new French government advocated for the continuation of the war, leading to over four more months of fighting, during which Paris was continuously besieged. With the city fully encircled, the Parisian garrison attempted three unsuccessful break-out attempts and German forces began a relatively ineffectual artillery bombardment campaign of the city in January 1871. In response to the poor results of the artillery bombardment, the Prussians brought forth large-caliber Krupp heavy siege artillery to attack the city beginning 25 January 1871. With the renewed artillery attack and an increasingly starving and ill Parisian population and garrison, the Government of National Defense would conclude armistice negotiations with the North German Confederation on 28 January 1871. While the armistice led to food shipments being immediately permitted into the city, the capture of their capital city and the disaster of the war itself would have a long-lasting impact on the French populace, Franco-German relations, and Europe as a whole. French defeat in the war would directly lead to a victorious North German Confederation unifying with still-independent South German states and declaring the German Empire as well as a disgruntled and radicalized Parisian population taking control of Paris and forming the Paris Commune.

== Background ==
As early as August 1870, the Prussian 3rd Army led by Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia (the future Frederick III, German Emperor), had been marching towards Paris. A French force accompanied by Napoleon III was deployed to aid the army encircled by Prussians at the Siege of Metz. This force was crushed at the Battle of Sedan, and the road to Paris was left open. Personally leading the Prussian forces, King William I of Prussia, along with his chief of staff Helmuth von Moltke, took the 3rd Army and the new Prussian Army of the Meuse under Albert, Crown Prince of Saxony, and marched on Paris virtually unopposed. In Paris, the governor and commander-in-chief of the city&#x27;s defenses, General Louis Jules Trochu, assembled a force of 60,000 regular soldiers who had managed to escape from Sedan under Joseph Vinoy or who were gathered from depot troops. Together with 90,000 &quot;Mobiles&quot; (Territorials), a brigade of 13,000 naval seamen and 350,000 National Guards, the potential defenders of Paris totaled around 513,000. The compulsorily enrolled National Guards were, however, untrained. They had 2,150 cannon plus 350 in reserve, and 8,000,000 kg of gunpowder.

The French had expected the war to be fought mainly on German soil; it was not until the defeats at Spicheren and Frœschwiller that the authorities began to take serious action in organizing the defenses of Paris. A committee under the leadership of Marshal Vaillant was formed and given a budget of 12 million francs to strengthen the defenses. Barriers were put up around the city, 12,000 workers employed to dig earthworks, a barrage placed across the Seine, and select approaches to the city laid with electrically-triggered mines. Forests and houses were cleared to improve the firing sight lines, roads were torn up, and railroad and road entrances to the city blocked. The Paris Catacombs were sealed off, along with certain quarries and excavations outside the city to deny an entry-point to the Prussians.

The authorities in Paris also attended to provisions and took steps to stockpile cereals, salted meat, and preserves for the population. Much of this was stored in the Opéra Garnier. The Bois de Boulogne and Luxembourg Gardens were packed with livestock – the former received some 250,000 sheep and 40,000 oxen. The government believed it had enough flour and wheat to last for 80 days, more than enough based on the assumption, then prevalent, that the siege would be relatively brief.

==Siege==
The Prussian armies quickly reached Paris, and on 15 September Moltke issued orders for the investment of the city. Crown Prince Albert&#x27;s army closed in on Paris from the north unopposed, while Crown Prince Frederick moved in from the south. On 17 September a force under Vinoy attacked Frederick&#x27;s army near Villeneuve-Saint-Georges in an effort to save a supply depot there, but it was eventually driven back by artillery fire. The railroad to Orléans was cut, and on the 18th Versailles was taken, and then served as the 3rd Army&#x27;s and eventually Wilhelm&#x27;s headquarters. By 19 September the encirclement was complete, and the siege officially began. Responsible for the direction of the siege was General (later Field Marshal) Leonhard von Blumenthal.

Prussia&#x27;s chancellor Otto von Bismarck suggested shelling Paris to ensure the city&#x27;s quick surrender and render all French efforts to free the city pointless, but the German high command, headed by the king of Prussia, turned down the proposal on the insistence of General von Blumenthal, on the grounds that a bombardment would affect civilians, violate the rules of engagement, and turn the opinion of third parties against the Germans, without speeding up the final victory.

It was also contended that a quick French surrender would leave the new French armies undefeated and allow France to renew the war shortly after. The new French armies would have to be annihilated first, and Paris would have to be starved into surrender.

Trochu had little faith in the ability of the National Guards, which made up half the force defending the city. So instead of making any significant attempt to prevent the investment by the Germans, Trochu hoped that Moltke would attempt to take the city by storm, and the French could then rely on the city&#x27;s defenses. These consisted of the Thiers wall and a ring of sixteen detached forts, all of which had been built in the 1840s. Moltke never had any intention of attacking the city and this became clear shortly after the siege began. Trochu changed his plan and allowed Vinoy to make a demonstration against the Prussians west of the Seine. On 30 September Vinoy attacked Chevilly with 20,000 soldiers and was soundly repulsed by the 3rd Army. Then on 13 October the II Royal Bavarian Corps was driven from Châtillon but the French were forced to retire in face of Prussian artillery.


General Carey de Bellemare commanded the strongest fortress north of Paris at Saint Denis.

On 29 October de Bellemare attacked the Prussian Guard at Le Bourget without orders, and took the town. The Guard actually had little interest in recapturing their positions at Le Bourget, but Crown Prince Albert ordered the city retaken anyway. In the Battle of Le Bourget the Prussian Guards succeeded in retaking the city and captured 1,200 French soldiers. Upon hearing of the French surrender at Metz and the defeat at Le Bourget, morale in Paris began to sink. The people of Paris were beginning to suffer from the effects of the German blockade. On 31 October, the day the government confirmed the surrender of Metz and one day after Le Bourget&#x27;s recapture was announced, an angry mob besieged and invaded the Hôtel de Ville, taking Trochu and his cabinet hostage. The insurgent leaders (Gustave Flourens, Louis Charles Delescluze, Louis Auguste Blanqui among them) attempted to depose Trochu&#x27;s government and form a new one led by themselves, but they could not come to an agreement. In the meantime, battalions of loyal National Guards led by Jules Ferry and a detachment of &quot;Mobiles&quot; headed by the Prefect of Police, Edmond Adam, prepared to retake the building. Negotiations between the two sides concluded with a peaceful evacuation of the building by the insurgents early in the morning of November 1, and the release of the hostages. Despite promising no reprisals against the revolutionaries, the Government was swift to arrest and imprison 22 of the leaders, which further embittered the left-wing of Paris.

Hoping to boost morale on 30 November Trochu launched the largest attack from Paris even though he had little hope of achieving a breakthrough. Nevertheless, he sent Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot with 80,000 soldiers against the Prussians at Champigny, Créteil and Villiers. In what became known as the Battle of Villiers the French succeeded in capturing and holding a position at Créteil and Champigny. By 2 December the XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps had driven Ducrot back into the defenses and the battle was over by 3 December.


On 21 December, French forces attempted another breakout at Le Bourget, in the hopes of meeting up with General Louis Faidherbe&#x27;s army. Trochu and Ducrot had been encouraged by Faidherbe&#x27;s capture on 9 December of Ham, around 65 miles from Paris. The weather was extremely cold, and the well-installed, well-concealed Prussian artillery inflicted heavy casualties on the advancing French. Soldiers camped overnight with no fuel for warmth, as the temperature fell to 7°F (−14°C). There were over 900 cases of frostbite, and 2,000 casualties on the French side. On the Prussian side, there were less than 500 dead.

On 19 January a final breakout attempt was aimed at the Château of Buzenval in Rueil-Malmaison near the Prussian Headquarters, west of Paris. The crown prince easily repulsed the attack inflicting over 4,000 casualties while suffering just over 600. Trochu resigned as governor and left General Joseph Vinoy with 146,000 defenders.

During the winter, tensions began to arise in the Prussian high command. Field-Marshal Helmuth von Moltke and General Leonhard, Count von Blumenthal, who commanded the siege, were primarily concerned with a methodical siege that would destroy the detached forts around the city and slowly strangle the defending forces with a minimum of German casualties.



But as time wore on, there was growing concern that a prolonged war was placing too much strain on the German economy and that an extended siege would convince the French Government of National Defense that Prussia could still be beaten. A prolonged campaign would also allow France time to reconstitute a new army and convince neutral powers to enter the war against Prussia. To Bismarck, Paris was the key to breaking the power of the intransigent republican leaders of France, ending the war in a timely manner, and securing peace terms favourable to Prussia. Moltke was also worried that insufficient winter supplies were reaching the German armies investing the city, as diseases such as tuberculosis were breaking out amongst the besieging soldiers. In addition, the siege operations competed with the demands of the ongoing Loire Campaign against the remaining French field armies.

Air medical transport is often stated to have first occurred in 1870 during the siege of Paris when 160 wounded French soldiers were evacuated from the city by hot-air balloon, but this myth has been definitively disproven by full review of the crew and passenger records of each balloon which left Paris during the siege.
During the siege, the only head of diplomatic mission from a major power who remained in Paris was United States Minister to France, Elihu B. Washburne. As a representative of a neutral country, Washburne was able to play a unique role in the conflict, becoming one of the few channels of communication into and out of the city for much of the siege. He also led the way in providing humanitarian relief to foreign nationals, including ethnic Germans.

===Food &amp; fuel shortages===
As the siege wore on, food supplies dwindled, and prices skyrocketed. The authorities instituted price controls on certain staple foods at the beginning of the siege, but these were rendered ineffective by a lack of enforcement and the rampant black market in the city. Until mid-October there was no rationing of any kind, and afterwards only meat was subject to rationing (bread was rationed at the very end of the siege). There were also no attempts to limit hoarding and speculation. Many of the wealthier residents were well-placed to weather the siege since they had put aside stores of food before it began. Infant mortality soared because of the lack of fresh milk. Poor women and their children suffered the most of anybody. Their husbands had the relative advantage of their 1.50 francs per day National Guard pay, &quot;little enough of which reached their wives&quot;, and the fact that they were occupied, because &quot;anyone who was occupied – even the National Guardsman warming himself in the bistro while his wife queued for food – had a better chance of survival.&quot;

Parisians turned first to horses in early-October to supplement their dwindling supplies of fresh meat. By mid-November, fresh meat had truly run out in the city, and butchers began offering dog and cat meat. People also turned to rats for meat, although the numbers of rats consumed was relatively low due to fear of disease, and the expense of preparing rat meat in order to make it edible. Once the supply of those animals ran low, the citizens of Paris turned on the zoo animals residing at Jardin des plantes. Even Castor and Pollux, the only pair of elephants in Paris, were slaughtered for their meat.

A Latin Quarter menu contemporary with the siege reads in part:
: * Consommé de cheval au millet. (horse)
: * Brochettes de foie de chien à la maître d&#x27;hôtel. (dog)
: * Emincé de rable de chat. Sauce mayonnaise. (cat)
: * Epaules et filets de chien braisés. Sauce aux tomates. (dog)
: * Civet de chat aux champignons. (cat)
: * Côtelettes de chien aux petits pois. (dog)
: * Salamis de rats. Sauce Robert. (rats)
: * Gigots de chien flanqués de ratons. Sauce poivrade. (dog, rats)
: * Begonias au jus. (flowers)
: * Plum-pudding au rhum et à la Moelle de Cheval. (horse)

The increasing hunger of the Parisians coincided with bitterly cold winter weather and a dire lack of fuel for heat. Coal gas, because of its essential use for the balloons, was strictly rationed and mostly replaced by oil. On November 25, oil itself was requisitioned. This left people reliant on increasingly scarce supplies of wood. By late-December, the inhabitants of working-class Belleville were so desperate for wood they had felled the street trees of their neighborhoods and were moving into the wealthier areas of western Paris, cutting down trees along the Champs Élysées and Avenue Foch. By January, 3,000–4,000 people were dying per week from the effects of cold and hunger. There were sharp rises in cases of smallpox, typhoid, and especially pneumonia. Typhoid came because the siege forced Parisians to turn to the Seine for much of their drinking water.

===Bombardment===
In January, on Bismarck&#x27;s advice, the Germans fired some 12,000 shells into the city over 23 nights in an attempt to break Parisian morale. The attack on the city itself was preceded by the bombardment of the southern forts from the Châtillon Heights on 5 January. That day, the guns of forts Issy and Vanves were silenced by a relentless barrage, allowing the Prussian artillery to be moved up to 750 yards closer to Paris. This made a crucial difference, as from their previous position the guns were only capable of reaching the fringes of the city. The first shells fell on the Left Bank that same day.

Prussian artillerymen aimed their guns at the highest angles possible and increased the charges to obtain unprecedented ranges. Even so, although shells reached the Pont Notre-Dame and the Île Saint-Louis, none made it to the Right Bank. Up to 20,000 refugees fled the Left Bank, putting a further strain on the already overburdened food supplies of the Right Bank &quot;arrondissements&quot;. The domes of the Panthéon and the Invalides were frequent targets of the artillerymen, and the vicinities of those buildings were particularly damaged as a result. Shells also struck the Salpetrière Hospital and the Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon (then being used as a hospital), leading some to believe that the Prussians were deliberately targeting hospitals. Moltke, in response to a complaint on this matter from Trochu, responded that he hoped to soon move the artillery closer so that his gunners could better identify the Red Cross flags.

About 400 perished or were wounded by the bombardment which, &quot;had little effect on the spirit of resistance in Paris.&quot; Delescluze declared, &quot;The Frenchmen of 1870 are the sons of those Gauls for whom battles were holidays.&quot; In actuality, the level of destruction fell short of what the Prussians had expected. The shells often caused little damage to the buildings they struck, and many fell in open spaces away from people. An English observer, Edwin Child, wrote that he &quot;Became more and more convinced of the impossibility of effectually bombarding Paris, the houses being built of such solid blocks of stone that they could only be destroyed piecemeal. One bomb simply displaces one stone, in spite of their enormous weight...&quot;

==Armistice and surrender==

On 25 January 1871, Wilhelm I overruled Moltke and ordered the field-marshal to consult with Bismarck for all future operations. Bismarck immediately ordered the city to be bombarded with large-caliber Krupp siege guns. This prompted the city&#x27;s surrender on 28 January 1871.

Secret armistice discussions began on January 23, 1871 and continued at Versailles between Jules Favre and Bismarck until the 27th. On the French side there was concern that the National Guard would rebel when news of the capitulation became public. Bismarck&#x27;s advice was to &quot;provoke an uprising, then, while you still have an army with which to suppress it&quot;. The final terms agreed on were that the French regular troops (less one division) would be disarmed, Paris would pay an indemnity of two hundred million francs, and the fortifications around the perimeter of the city would be surrendered. In return the armistice was extended until February 19.

Food supplies from the provinces, as well as shiploads from Britain and the United States, began to enter the starving city almost immediately. Britain sent ships from the Royal Navy loaded with Army food provisions, while private organizations like the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Relief Fund and the London Relief Committee made significant donations. According to the British representative responsible for distributing the foodstuffs, at the beginning of February the London Relief Committee donated &quot;nearly 10,000 tons of flour, 450 tons of rice, 900 tons of biscuits, 360 tons of fish, and nearly 4,000 tons of fuel, with about 7,000 head of livestock&quot;. The United States sent around $2 million worth of food, but much of it was held up at the port of Le Havre because of a shortage of workers for unloading the ships. The arrival of the first British convoy of food at Les Halles sparked a riot and pillaging, &quot;while for seven hours the police seemed powerless to intervene&quot;.
Thirty thousand Prussian, Bavarian and Saxon troops held a brief victory parade in Paris on March 1, 1871 and Bismarck honored the armistice by sending trainloads of food into the city. The German troops departed after two days to take up temporary encampments to the east of the city, to be withdrawn from there when France paid the agreed war indemnity. While Parisians scrubbed the streets &quot;polluted&quot; by the triumphal entry, no serious incidents occurred during the short and symbolic occupation of the city. This was in part because the Germans had avoided areas such as Belleville, where hostility was reportedly high.

== Air mail ==

Balloon mail was the only means by which communications from the besieged city could reach the rest of France. The use of balloons to carry mail was first proposed by the photographer and balloonist Felix Nadar, who had established the grandiosely titled &quot;No. 1 Compagnie des Aérostatiers&quot;, with a single balloon, the &quot;Neptune&quot;, at its disposal, to perform tethered ascents for observation purposes. However the Prussian encirclement of the city made this pointless, and on 17 September Nadar wrote to the Council for the Defence of Paris proposing the use of balloons for communication with the outside world: a similar proposal had also been made by the balloonist Eugène Godard.

The first balloon launch was carried out on 23 September, using the &quot;Neptune&quot;, and carried of mail in addition to the pilot. After a three-hour flight it landed at Craconville from Paris. Following this success a regular mail service was established, with a rate of 20 centimes per letter. Two workshops to manufacture balloons were set up, one under the direction of Nadar in the Elysée-Montmartre dance-hall (later moved to the Gare du Nord), and the other under the direction of Godard in the Gare d&#x27;Orleans. Around 66 balloon flights were made, including one that accidentally set a world distance record by ending up in Norway. The vast majority of these succeeded: only five were captured by the Prussians, and three went missing, presumably coming down in the Atlantic or Irish Sea. The number of letters carried has been estimated at around 2.5 million.
Some balloons also carried passengers in addition to the cargo of mail, most notably Léon Gambetta, the minister for War in the new government, who was flown out of Paris on 7 October.
The balloons also carried homing pigeons out of Paris to be used for pigeon post. This was the only means by which communications from the rest of France could reach the besieged city. A specially laid telegraph cable on the bed of the Seine had been discovered and cut by the Prussians on 27 September, couriers attempting to make their way through the German lines were almost all intercepted, and although other methods were tried, including attempts to use balloons, dogs, and message canisters floated down the Seine, these were all unsuccessful.
The pigeons were taken to their base, first at Tours and later at Poitiers, and when they had been fed and rested were ready for the return journey. Tours lies some from Paris and Poitiers some distant. Before release, they were loaded with their dispatches. Initially the pigeon post was only used for official communications but on 4 November the government announced that members of the public could send messages, these being limited to twenty words at a charge of 50 centimes per word.
These were then copied onto sheets of cardboard and photographed by a M. Barreswille, a photographer based in Tours. Each sheet contained 150 messages and was reproduced as a print about in size: each pigeon could carry nine of these. The photographic process was further refined by René Dagron to allow more to be carried: Dagron, with his equipment, was flown out of Paris on 12 November in the aptly named &quot;Niépce, &quot; narrowly escaping capture by the Prussians. The photographic process allowed multiple copies of the messages to be sent, so that although only 57 of the 360 pigeons released reached Paris more than 60,000 of the 95,000 messages sent were delivered. (some sources give a considerably higher figure of around 150,000 official and 1 million private communications, but this figure is arrived at by counting all copies of each message.)

==Aftermath==
Late in the siege, William I was proclaimed as German Emperor on 18 January 1871 at the Palace of Versailles. The kingdoms of Bavaria, Württemberg, and Saxony, the states of Baden and Hesse, and the free cities of Hamburg and Bremen were unified with the North German Confederation to create the German Empire. The preliminary peace treaty was signed at Versailles, and the final peace treaty, the Treaty of Frankfurt, was signed on 10 May 1871. Otto von Bismarck was able to secure Alsace-Lorraine as part of the German Empire.

The continued presence of German troops outside the city angered Parisians. Further resentment arose against the French government, and in March 1871 Parisian workers and members of the National Guard rebelled and established the Paris Commune, a radical socialist government, which lasted through late May of that year.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Empires of Sand&quot; by David W. Ball (Bantam Dell, 1999) is a novel in two parts, the first of which is set during the Franco-Prussian war, more particularly the Siege of Paris during the winter of 1870–71. Key elements of the siege, including the hot-air balloons used for reconnaissance and messages, the tunnels beneath the city, the starvation and the cold, combine to render a vivid impression of war-time Paris before its surrender.

&quot;The Old Wives&#x27; Tale&quot; by Arnold Bennett is a novel which follows the fortunes of two sisters, Constance and Sophia Baines. The latter runs away to make a disastrous marriage in France, where after being abandoned by her husband, she lives through the Siege of Paris and the Commune.

<text>Norris Henry Cotton (May 11, 1900 – February 24, 1989) was an American politician from the state of New Hampshire. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a U.S. Representative and subsequently as a U.S. Senator.

==Early life==
Cotton was born on a farm in Warren, New Hampshire, and was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and Wesleyan University in Connecticut. He was the son of Henry Lang and Elizabeth (née Moses) Cotton. While in college, he served as a clerk to the New Hampshire State Senate. He also served as a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1923 as one of the youngest legislators in history. He became a lawyer after attending George Washington University Law School and practiced law in Lebanon, New Hampshire.

==Career==
Cotton was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives again in 1943, and served as majority leader that year and as Speaker from 1945 to 1947.

In 1946, Cotton was elected to the United States House of Representatives from New Hampshire&#x27;s 2nd congressional district for the first time. He served until 1954, when he ran for a seat in the United States Senate from New Hampshire in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of incumbent Senator Charles W. Tobey. He was elected to a full term in 1956, reelected twice and served in the Senate until 1975.

Cotton voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court, but against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Cotton was the only New England senator do so. Cotton was one of thirteen Republican senators to vote in favor of Medicare. He was a prominent leader of his party in the Senate, chairing the Senate Republican Conference from 1973 to 1975. He did not run for reelection in 1974. Three days before his final term ran out, Cotton resigned to allow the governor to appoint Louis C. Wyman.

Cotton returned to the Senate in August 1975 after the election of his successor was contested. The closest Senate election in history, it went through two recounts at the state level, followed by protracted debate on the Senate floor, until both candidates agreed to a special election. Cotton served as a temporary senator until the September 1975 special election, the result of which was not challenged; Cotton returned to Lebanon, New Hampshire. Cotton was the last senator to return to the senate via appointment for 43 years until Arizona&#x27;s former Senator Jon Kyl was appointed by Governor Doug Ducey in 2018 following the death of Senator John McCain.

==Death and legacy==
Cotton died on February 24, 1989, in Lebanon, aged 88. He is interred at School Street Cemetery in Lebanon.

The Norris Cotton Cancer Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon is named for him, and a federal building in Manchester also bears his name. There is a New Hampshire historical marker (number 231) in Warren, unveiled in 2012, which says that his rise from humble beginnings &quot;embodied an American way of life.&quot;

==Family life==
He had a daughter, Mary Martha Ballou, on February 15, 1925. He married Ruth Isaacs on May 11, 1927. They had no children. Ruth died in 1978 and he married his housekeeper, Eleanor Coolidge Brown, in 1980.

<text>Graceland University is a private university with campuses in Lamoni, Iowa, and Independence, Missouri. The university offers degree completion and master&#x27;s degree programs. It also offers undergraduate and graduate programs online. The university was founded in 1895. Graceland was established by, and is affiliated with, the Community of Christ, formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church).

Graceland&#x27;s main campus in Lamoni offers over 50 academic programs, including 9 preprofessional programs and 35 undergraduate majors. The residential campus also offers 18 varsity sports, campus-wide activities, and intramural sports.

The Independence campus offers graduate and undergraduate programs in the School of Nursing and the Edmund J. Gleazer School of Education. The campus is also home to programs in the Community of Christ Seminary.

==History==
Graceland University was established as Graceland College in 1895 by the RLDS Church (later the Community of Christ) in Lamoni, Iowa. Land for the college was donated by church members, with the first 20 acres given by Marietta Walker. The name &quot;Graceland&quot; was selected by Colonel George Barrett, land surveyor for the college, for the graceful slope of the hill upon which it was built. Until the administration building was completed, classes were conducted in a building in downtown Lamoni. The first day of classes was September 17, 1895.

In 1917, Graceland received accreditation from the states of Iowa and Missouri and from the North Central Association of Colleges, making it the first fully accredited junior college in Iowa. Graceland became a four-year college in 1960. Its nursing program began in 1910 as a cooperative program with the Independence Sanitarium and Hospital in Independence, MO. The Graceland campus was extended to Independence with the establishment of the college&#x27;s bachelor&#x27;s degree program in 1968–69.

The Graceland Partnership Program, offering degree-completion programs on community college campuses, was established in 1989. In 1995, Graceland acquired SkillPath, a business training company that offers seminars and classes. Graceland College became Graceland University on June 1, 2000.

Patricia Draves was Graceland&#x27;s president from June 15, 2017 until she resigned in 2024 to become president of Monmouth College. Joel Shrock acted as interim president from summer 2024 until Graceland instated him as president on September 10, 2024.

==Academics==
=== Reputation ===
Graceland ranked &quot;first tier&quot; in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Best Colleges&quot; in 2011, 2012 and 2013. It falls in the &quot;Private University&quot; category, &quot;Midwest Region&quot;. In 2012, Graceland ranked 91st and in 2013 88th. The reports cite Graceland&#x27;s small class sizes, with 72% of classes containing 20 or fewer students, financial aid services, and the university&#x27;s &quot;selective&quot; admissions process. Graceland has also been recognized by the Princeton Review as a top school in the Midwest.

=== Accreditation ===
Graceland is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. The teacher education programs are accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). The nursing programs are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) and have full approval status with the Iowa Board of Nursing and the Missouri State Board of Nursing.

=== Programs ===

==== College of Liberal Arts and Sciences ====
Graceland&#x27;s College of Liberal Arts and Science holds classes only on the Lamoni campus. The college holds five divisions: Division of Visual and Performing Arts, Division of Health and Movement Science, Division of Humanities, Division of Science and Math and the Division of Social Science. Among these divisions are over 30 majors, including pre-professional programs.

==== School of Nursing ====
The School of Nursing is one of Graceland&#x27;s most popular programs. The School of Nursing offers classes on the Independence Campus and online. In the undergraduate nursing program (Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) to Registered Nurse), students complete four semesters of general education classes on the Lamoni campus, then transfer to the Independence campus to complete their final four semesters. An accelerated nursing program is available that allows students to graduate is seven semesters.

The School of Nursing&#x27;s online programs include both graduate and undergraduate degrees: BA in health care management, RN to BSN, RN to MSN, Master of Nursing, Family Nurse Practitioner Post Master MSN certificate, Nurse Educator Post Master MSN certificate and a Doctor of Nursing Practice.

==== Edmund J. Gleazer School of Education ====
The Edmund J. Gleazer School of Education, named for Edmund John Gleazer Jr., a past president of the university, is one of Graceland&#x27;s largest programs. The school offers both undergraduate and graduate programs. Classes are offered on the Lamoni campus, Independence campus, the regional campuses and online.

Undergraduate degrees include elementary education and secondary education. The Lamoni campus is the only location that offers a secondary teaching certificate. The School of Education has a partnership with Kansas City, MO, schools, called Professional Development Schools (PDS). The PDS partnership assigns education students to an in-the-field classroom for an entire semester of student teaching (as opposed to the traditional one semester.)

The School of Education offers international programs, where students can student-teach in New Zealand, or take winter term classes in Jamaica and Zambia.

Graduate programs include a Master&#x27;s of Education with six different specializations: literacy instruction, management in the inclusive classroom, collaborative teaching and learning, differentiated instruction, technology integration and mild/moderate special education.

==== C.H. Sandage School of Business ====
The C.H. Sandage School of Business offers undergraduate programs. Classes are held on the Lamoni campus and degree completion programs are held online and at regional campuses. Programs include accounting, agricultural business, business administration, economics, organizational leadership and sport management.

The School of Business maintains a close partnership with the John C. Whitehead School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Seton Hall University. Graceland students who plan to attend a graduate school are encouraged to consider Seton Hall as an option. The School of Business is named after Charles H. Sandage, a past professor for the university.

===== Enactus =====
The School of Business is tied to Graceland&#x27;s Enactus team. Founded in 1989, the team works internationally and locally. In recent years, Graceland Enactus program has taken winter term trips to Zambia, the Philippines and Belize. In 1996 Graceland Enactus was named U.S. National Champion, and advanced to compete at the Enactus World Cup in Paris, France. The team finished second to China at the competition. In April 2012, Graceland Enactus was named Regional Champion for the 12th consecutive year and placed in the top eight teams at the Enactus National Exposition.

==== Community of Christ Seminary ====
The Community of Christ Seminary is offered online or at the Community of Christ Temple. The program offers a Master&#x27;s of Arts in religion.

==Chapel==
The Cheville Chapel was dedicated in 1978 in honor of Roy Cheville, theologian, educator and former Presiding Patriarch of the Community of Christ. The structure was built for $325,000 and funded by a restricted private bequest. In keeping with the desire for the chapel to be an accessible place of solitude, Graceland&#x27;s president Frank Hough determined that the facility should remain unstaffed and open at all times.

The chapel&#x27;s relatively small seating capacity makes it an intimate setting for worship, theological education and the performance of sacred music. Known for its excellent acoustics, it has been used for small ensemble performances. It is used several times a week by campus groups for worship services, and as a place of individual prayer and reflection.

Architecturally, the postmodern brick structure is minimalist. It is reminiscent of the exterior simplicity of the Rothko Chapel in Houston built only a few years earlier, while its twin steeple foreshadows the deconstructivist style in architecture that began a decade later. The chapel houses Aaron Sherer&#x27;s &quot;The Process of Becoming&quot;, a canvas wall hanging employing a mix of colorfully painted ribbons.

==Student life==
=== Residence life ===
Instead of having fraternities and sororities like many universities, Graceland has residential social organizations called &quot;Houses.&quot; These Houses are on Graceland&#x27;s main campus, but the Independence campus has its own House, McKevit Manor. Students are assigned to a House whether they live on or off campus. Graceland has eight men&#x27;s Houses: Agape, Cheville, Closson, Faunce, Orion, Powell, Stewart Manor, and Tiona; and eight women&#x27;s Houses: Amici, Aponivi, Hanthorne, Khiyah, Paloma, Sariah, Shalom, and Solah.

Each House has officers who serve on Graceland&#x27;s student government. The officers form a House Council, including a House President (who leads the House Council), a Campus Organization of Social Activities (COSA) representative, an Academic Student Council (ASC) representative, a senator, an intramural sports representative and a chaplain. House Council members are elected by members of their House. In addition to their student government duties, House Council members plan social activities called &quot;functions&quot;. The functions vary by House and range from formal dinners to campouts.

Houses hold meetings every Tuesday at 10 p.m. Meetings are led by the House President and House Council and vary widely from House to House.

=== Activities and organizations ===
Graceland has over 50 clubs and organizations for students. Between Graceland student government and the campus clubs and organizations, over 250 official leadership positions are available.

Graceland student government programs are a popular student activity, particularly for sophomore and junior students on campus.

Intramurals are one of the most popular campus activities, with over 47% student participation. Intramural teams are divided by House and level of competition.

Other popular student clubs include the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), International Club, Community Development Club, Enactus, Outdoor Club, Sustainability Club, Investment Club and the popular Lettuce Club, which meets once a year to have a lettuce eating competition, and the winner becomes the president for the next year.

=== Performing arts ===
With the completion of the Shaw Center expansion in fall 2012, Graceland has placed a renewed emphasis on the performing arts. Graceland performance groups include Chamber Singers, Concert Choir, Oratorio Chorus, Jazz Band, Pep Band, Symphonic Band, Orchestra and Theatre. For the 2012–2013 academic year, Graceland doubled its number of annual theatre productions. Over 1/3 of Graceland students participate in the arts (both visual and performing).

Graceland brings a variety of talent acts to campus. In 2012, Graceland brought in Canadian trumpeter Jens Lindemann, trombone player Wycliffe Gordon, the Fountain City Brass Band, vocalist Shannon Gaye, actor Arliss Howard, who directed Graceland&#x27;s homecoming play, the Vienna Boys Choir, and Owen/Cox Dance group.

=== School traditions ===
House Meeting

Every Tuesday at 10:00 p.m. students gather with their fellow House members in a weekly meeting. Meetings are led by the House President and involve House Council members. Meetings vary from House to House, but generally include recreational activities and announcements from House Council members. Meetings are generally held in House lounges.

Air Band

Every year at Graceland&#x27;s annual Homecoming weekend, COSA puts on an annual Air Band competition. Male Houses are paired with female Houses (brother/sister Houses) and teams compete against each other in a choreographed dance competition. Houses spend weeks preparing props, themes, and storylines for the competition, then perform their routines before a panel of judges. The winner of Air Band is awarded points, and the team with the most Homecoming points wins money for its House.

New Years in November

Every year in mid-November, COSA sponsors a campuswide dance and celebration, called New Year&#x27;s in November. The event is essentially a celebration of the coming new year, because students are not on campus for New Year&#x27;s Eve. The event has a specific theme every year and includes dancing and other activities. The event traditionally ends with a pancake breakfast in the Commons.

Final Fling

The final weekend of the semester, COSA sponsors a campuswide celebration for students. Events vary year to year, but often include inflatables, sports tournaments, and various entertainment acts. Students collect wristbands for each event they attend, and at the weekend&#x27;s conclusion enter their wristbands in a drawing for prizes.

Thursday Night Movie

Once a week, COSA plays a free movie in the local theatre, The Coliseum. Before 2012, the movie played on Wednesdays; the day was changed in fall 2012 to accommodate Graceland student government meetings.

==Athletics==
The Graceland athletic teams are called the Yellowjackets. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Heart of America Athletic Conference (HAAC) since the 1971–72 academic year. The Yellowjackets previously competed in the Missouri College Athletic Union (MCAU) from 1960–61 to 1970–71.

Graceland competes in 22 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor), volleyball and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, flag football, golf, soccer, softball, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading, dance and rodeo.

<text>The Official Municipality Key, formerly also known as the Official Municipality Characteristic Number or Municipality Code Number, is a number sequence for the identification of politically independent municipalities or unincorporated areas. Other classifications for the identification of areas include postal codes, NUTS codes or FIPS codes.

In Germany the Official Municipality Key serves statistical purposes and is issued by the statistics offices of individual German states. The municipality key is to be indicated in instances such as changing residence on the notice of departure or registration documents. This is done at the registration office in every town&#x27;s city hall.

=== Structure ===
The municipality key consists of eight digits, which are generated as follows: The designate the individual German state. The designates the government district (in areas without government districts a zero is used instead). The designate the number of the urban area (in a district-free city) or the district (in a city with districts). The indicate the municipality or the number of the unincorporated area.

==== Examples ====
 : Stuttgart

* : Baden-Württemberg
* : Government district of Stuttgart
* : Urban area of Stuttgart
* : No other municipality is available, since Stuttgart is an urban area

 : Aschersleben

* : Saxony-Anhalt
* : Government district of Magdeburg
* : District of Aschersleben Staßfurt
* : City of Aschersleben

== Switzerland == 

=== Structure ===
The Swiss Federal Statistical Office generates code numbers with up to four digits, which are sequentially assigned in accordance with the official order of the cantons, districts, and municipalities.

== Sweden ==
A kommunkod (municipal code) is a numerical code given to all Swedish municipalities by the Swedish tax authorities. The code consists of four digits, the first two indicating which county the municipality is situated in, and the last two specific for the municipality.

The code system was introduced with the municipal reform of 1952. There were three different categories of municipalities at the time, which affected the number that they were allocated. Those with stad-status (cities) were given codes ending in 80 to 99, smaller towns (köping) 60 to 79 and rural municipalities 01 to 59. The county seats were allocated codes ending in 80.

As part of the reform in the early 1970s, the categorization of municipalities was abolished, but the code was in most cases preserved. When several municipalities were merged, the code for the biggest municipality was kept.

==Philippines==

===Structure===

Usually known as the municipal code or , the number comprises nine digits rrppmmbbb, for which rr = region code, pp = province code, code, bbb = barangay code.

For example, the municipality of Ubay, Bohol has a code of 071246000 meaning region 07 (Central Visayas), province 12 (Bohol), municipality 46 (Ubay) with barangay code of zero signifying &quot;not at this level.&quot; Bongbong, one of its constituent barangays, has a code of 071246007.

The province code is unique and is independent of the region code. All PSGCs, are therefore, unique.

<doc id="1251640" wikidata="Q1093802" url="?curid=1251640" title="Mexican prairie dog">
<text>The Mexican prairie dog (Cynomys mexicanus) is a diurnal burrowing rodent native to north-central Mexico. Treatment as an agricultural pest has led to its status as an endangered species. They are closely related to squirrels, chipmunks, and marmots. &quot;Cynomys mexicanus&quot; originated about 230,000 years ago from a peripherally isolated population of the more widespread &quot;Cynomys ludovicianus&quot;.

==Ecology==

These prairie dogs prefer to inhabit rock-free soil in plains at an altitude of . They are found in the regions of southern Coahuila and northern San Luis Potosí in northern Mexico, where they eat herbs and grasses native to the plains where they live. They acquire all of their water from these plants. Although they are mainly herbivores, they have been known to eat insects. Predators include coyotes, bobcats, eagles, hawks, badgers, snakes, and weasels.

Northern prairie dogs hibernate and have a shorter mating season, which generally lasts from January to April. After one month&#x27;s gestation, females give birth to one litter per year, with an average of four hairless pups. They are born with their eyes closed and use their tails as visual aids until they can see, about 40 days after birth. Weaning occurs during late May and early June, when s may break away from the burrow. Pups leave their mothers by the fall.

As they grow older, young play fighting games that involve biting, hissing, and tackling. They reach sexual maturity after one year, with a lifespan of 3–5 years; adults weigh about and are long, and males are larger than females. Their coloring is tan, with darker ears and a lighter belly.

Prairie dogs have one of the most sophisticated languages in the animal world—a system of high-pitched yips and barks—and can run up to . As a consequence, their defense mechanism is to sound the alarm, and get away quickly.

== Habitat ==
Mexican prairie dogs live in excavated colonies, referred to as &quot;towns&quot;, which they dig for shelter and protection. A typical town has a funnel-like entrance that slants down into a corridor up to long, with side chambers for storage and nesting. It has been found that some chambers in these burrows serve specific purposes such as nurseries for new mothers and their young. Prairie dogs have strong muscles in their arms which allow them to dig through the often dense dirt of their habitats. They have even been found to use their teeth to dig, although this is less common. Towns can contain hundreds of animals, but generally have fewer than 50, with a single alpha male. Sometimes, spotted ground squirrels or burrowing owls share the burrow with its rightful owners.

== Keystone Species ==
Due to their impact on other animals and the environment, Mexican prairie dogs are identified as a keystone species with a bottom-up approach. Their burrows, while they serve as a shelter for them, serve as a shelter to other species, as well, such as rattlesnakes and burrowing owls. Mexican prairie dogs also graze the prairie&#x27;s grasslands, increasing the nutrition of the grasses for other animals.

==Population structure==
In 1956, the Mexican prairie dog was reported as occurring in Coahuila, Nuevo León, and San Luis Potosí. By the 1980s, it had disappeared from Nuevo León. As of 1992 its complete range was roughly . Viewed as a pest and an obstacle to agriculture and cattle raising due to their burrowing and frequent consumption of crops, Mexican prairie dogs were frequently poisoned, and became endangered in 1994. Mexican prairie dogs currently inhabit less than 4% of their former territory and have suffered a 33% decrease in range between 1996 and 1999.

The current habitat of Mexican prairie dogs is in the region known as El Tokio. These are the grasslands located in the convergence of the states of San Luis Potosí, Nuevo León, and Coahuila. Due to the underground structures in which many prairie dogs live, it is difficult to accurately survey populations. The use of satellite imagery has proven to be helpful in documenting areas in which prairie dogs reside.

Conservation groups such as Pronatura Noreste and Profauna, with the help of donors, carry out conservation efforts for the protection of prairie dogs and associated species, such as shorebirds and birds of prey. Pronatura Noreste, as of February 2007, has signed conservation easements with &quot;ejidos&quot; and private owners for the protection of more than of Mexican prairie dog grasslands.

<doc id="1251647" wikidata="Q2301224" url="?curid=1251647" title="Yukon Quest">
<text>The Yukon Quest, formally the Yukon Quest 1,000-mile International Sled Dog Race, is a sled dog race scheduled every February since 1984 between Fairbanks, Alaska, and Whitehorse, Yukon, switching directions each year. Because of the harsh winter conditions, difficult trail, and the limited support that competitors are allowed, it is considered the &quot;most difficult sled dog race in the world&quot;, or even the &quot;toughest race in the world&quot;—&quot;even tougher, more selective and less attention-seeking than the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.&quot; The originator envisioned it as &quot;a race so rugged that only purists would participate.&quot;

In the competition, first run in 1984, a dog team leader (called a musher) and a team of 6 to 14 dogs race for 10 to 20 days. The course follows the route of the historic 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, mail delivery, and transportation routes between Fairbanks, Dawson City, and Whitehorse. Mushers pack up to of equipment and provisions for themselves and their dogs to survive between checkpoints. Each musher must rely on a single sled for the entire run, versus three in the Iditarod.

Ten checkpoints and four dog drops, some more than apart, lie along the trail. Veterinarians are present at each to ensure the health and welfare of the dogs, give advice, and provide veterinary care for dropped dogs; together with the race marshal or a race judge, they may remove a dog or team from the race for medical or other reasons. There are only nine checkpoints for rest, versus 22 in the Iditarod. Mushers are permitted to leave dogs at checkpoints and dog drops, but not to replace them. Sleds may not be replaced (without penalty) and mushers cannot accept help from non-racers except at Dawson City, the halfway mark.

The route runs on frozen rivers, over four mountain ranges, and through isolated northern villages. Racers cover or more. Temperatures commonly drop as low as , and winds can reach at higher elevations. Because it begins a month earlier than the Iditarod, the Quest is a colder race, and is run on shorter solar days and through longer, darker nights. Sonny Lindner won the inaugural race in 1984 from a field of 26 teams. The fastest run took place in 2010, when Hans Gatt finished after 9 days and 26 minutes. The 2012 competition had the closest one-two finish, as Hugh Neff beat Allen Moore by twenty-six seconds.

In 2005, Lance Mackey became the first Yukon Quest rookie to win the race, a feat that was repeated by 2011&#x27;s champion, Dallas Seavey. In 2007, Mackey became the first to win both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod, a feat he repeated the following year. The longest race time was in 1988, when Ty Halvorson took 20 days, 8 hours, and 29 minutes to finish. In 2000, Aliy Zirkle became the first woman to win the race, in 10 days, 22 hours, and 57 minutes. Yukon Quest International, which runs the Yukon Quest sled dog race, also runs two shorter races: the Junior Quest and the Yukon Quest 300 (previously the Yukon Quest 250).

The 2020 race finished on schedule despite the incipient COVID-19 pandemic, however the 2021 race was cancelled due to border closures and Covid protocols. In 2022, the US and Canadian sides separated to produce their own shorter versions of the races. To maintain a competitive format, the organizations adopted a multi-race format of different distances that ran along the portions of the trail on either side of the border. This format continued in 2023 and will be the same for the 2024 races. The Yukon Quest International Association (Canada) manages the Canadian side of the Yukon Quest.

== History ==
The idea for the Yukon Quest originated in April 1983 during a bar-room discussion among four Alaskans: LeRoy Shank, Roger Williams, Ron Rosser, and William &quot;Willy&quot; Lipps. The four proposed a thousand-mile sled dog race from Fairbanks, Alaska to Whitehorse, Yukon, to celebrate the Klondike Gold Rush-era mail and transportation routes between the two. They disdained the many checkpoints and stages of the Iditarod Sled Dog Race and envisioned an endurance race in which racers would rely on themselves and survival would be as important as speed. &quot;We wanted more of a Bush experience, a race that would put a little woodsmanship into it&quot;, Shank said at the race&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

This remained a vague plan until August 1983, when the first public organizational meetings took place. Fundraising began, and the start date for the race was optimistically moved forward from February 1985 to February 25, 1984. The entry fee for the first race was $500, and Murray Clayton of Haines, Alaska became the first person to enter when he paid his fee in October 1983. In December 1983, the race was officially named the Yukon Quest. Two more months of planning followed, and a crew of volunteers was organized to staff the checkpoints and place trail markers. On February 25, 1984, 26 racers left Fairbanks for Whitehorse. Each team was limited to a maximum of 12 dogs, and racers had to finish with no fewer than nine. They also had to haul of food per dog ( total) to cover the long distances between checkpoints.

Numerous problems occurred in the first race. The leading mushers had to break trail because the snowmobile intended for the task broke down. Trail markers often were absent or misplaced, and no preparations had been made for racers in Dawson City until organizer Roger Williams flew there shortly after the race began. After Dawson City, mushers had their dogs and sleds trucked to avoid a section of snowless trail, then had to deal with open sections of the Yukon River near Whitehorse due to above-average temperatures. The eventual winner of the inaugural race, Sonny Lindner, was greeted with little fanfare on his arrival. On the race&#x27;s 25th anniversary, he recalled, &quot;I think it was 90 percent (camping) trip and maybe a little bit of racing.&quot;

After the inaugural race, organizers improved the marking of the trail for the first contest held in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks direction. Musher Bill Cotter said, &quot;The trail was so nice that it was difficult to keep from going too fast.&quot; The race grew in popularity over the next few years. In 1988 and again in 1989, 47 mushers entered. In 1989, 31 completed the race—the most that have ever finished it. In 1990, Connie and Terri Frerichs became the first (and so far only) mother and daughter to compete in the same Yukon Quest: Terri finished 21st, beating her mother (22nd) by 26 minutes. The 1991 race saw eight teams withdraw in the first quarter because of an outbreak of a canine disease called the &quot;Healy Virus&quot;. Thirty-five more dogs were sickened before the spread of the virus was halted by colder weather halfway through the race. In 1992, unseasonable warmth caused problems in the first half of the race, and the second was affected by bitter cold. The head veterinarian of that race, Jeannie Olson, was replaced after she offered canine acupuncture to several mushers. Though not then forbidden by any rule, this violated equal-treatment guidelines because she did not offer the treatment to every musher. At the end of that race, George Cook became the first musher since 1984 to finish short of Whitehorse when open water on the Yukon River prevented him from continuing. Because he did not quit, race officials gave him the Red Lantern Award.

Following the 1992 race, controversy erupted when the Alaska board of directors of Yukon Quest International informed the Yukon board that they were considering dropping the Yukon half of the Quest because Yukon officials did not meet fundraising goals. Alaska officials also believed it would be easier to manage an Alaska-only race. A crisis was averted when the Yukon board of directors agreed to raise more money and the two sides formed a joint board of directors. The 1993 race was run as usual, but Jeff Mann had a more eventful race than most. When a moose attacked his dog team, he was forced to kill it with an axe, then butcher it according to Quest rules. Later, he was penalized 90 minutes for borrowing a reporter&#x27;s head lantern. Finally, after the conclusion of the race, he was fined half his winnings when his dogs tested positive for ibuprofen.

In the 1994 race, Alaskan Bruce Cosgrove was denied entry by Canadian customs officials in the pre-race verification process, the only time a musher has been denied entry into either Canada or Alaska. Cosgrove started the race, but quit before the border. Following the race, controversy again erupted when Alaska Yukon Quest officials announced they would unilaterally eliminate Whitehorse from the Yukon Quest and run a cheaper Fairbanks-to-Dawson City race. Members of the Yukon Quest organization revolted against this and voted to evict the board members who had proposed it.

=== Second decade ===
The 1995 race featured 22 mushers, of whom 13 finished. Budget problems caused the first prize to drop by 25% to $15,000, contributing to the low participation. This problem was fixed for the 1996 race, with a first-place prize of $25,000. The 1997 race was won by Rick Mackey, brother of later Quest winner Lance Mackey; the two are the only brother-brother winning tandem in Quest history. Following the 1997 race, financial troubles again arose, this time on the Alaska side. Canadian organizers secured international sponsorship for the 1998 race, and when they refused to let this sponsorship money be used to pay debts accumulated in Alaska, members of the Alaska board threatened to host a separate competition. In the end, the Alaska board members were forced to resign, and a deal was worked out between the two sides.
The 1998 race was run on schedule and had 38 entrants. The 1999 race was won by Alaska Native Ramy Brooks, who defeated veterinarian Mark May by 10 minutes. In 2000, Aliy Zirkle became the first woman to win the Yukon Quest after taking 10 days, 22 hours, and 57 minutes to trek the . Also in 2000, Yukon Quest International added two races: the Quest 250 (today the Quest 300) and the Junior Quest (both described below). Competitors in each have gone on to participate in the Yukon Quest. The first of these graduated mushers competed in the 2001 race, won by Tim Osmar.

In 2002, the Yukon Quest was won by Hans Gatt, an Austrian-born resident of British Columbia and the first European to win. This was the first of three consecutive wins, making him the first three-time winner. In 2003, Gatt&#x27;s second win was truncated by a lack of snow near Whitehorse. Unseasonable warmth forced organizers to truck mushers and their dog teams to Braeburn before continuing what became a competition. The 2004 race saw 31 mushers start the race and 20 finish, a drop-out rate of 35%. During the first 24 years of the competition, there were 776 starters and 513 finishers. Though 90 more mushers attempted the race in the first 12 years than in the next dozen runnings, there is little difference in the percentage that did not finish (35% in 1984–1995; 33% in 1996–2007).

=== Third decade ===
In 2005, first-time participant Lance Mackey broke Hans Gatt&#x27;s three-win streak. Mackey finished in 11 days, 32 seconds. The victory was the first of four straight wins by Mackey, who holds the record for most consecutive wins and is also the only four-time winner. During Mackey&#x27;s second win, a fierce storm atop Eagle Summit caused a whiteout that forced seven mushers and dog teams to be evacuated by helicopter. Partly because of the storm, only 11 finished the 2006 race—the fewest ever. The finishers also endured an unusual course: because snow was scarce near Whitehorse, they doubled back and finished in Dawson City after racing the . In 2007, three dogs were killed in unrelated incidents, but Mackey tied Gatt&#x27;s record of three consecutive wins. One month later, Mackey became the first person to win both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod in the same year. Mackey&#x27;s fourth win came during the 2008 race, the first Yukon Quest to end in Whitehorse since 2003.

Because of the late 2000s recession, the 2009 Yukon Quest purse was reduced to $151,000 from a planned total of $200,000. As a result, the first prize was reduced to $30,000 from the planned $35,000. Partly because of this, Mackey withdrew before the race, making it easier for a newcomer to win. In the closest one–two finish, German Sebastian Schnuelle completed the race faster than anyone before, finishing that year&#x27;s trip in 9 days, 23 hours, and 20 minutes. He was just four minutes ahead of Hugh Neff.

Following the 2009 race, officials decided to advance the competition&#x27;s start date by one week to better accommodate mushers also participating in the Iditarod. The 2010 race started in Fairbanks on February 6, 2010, and the early start date was kept for the 2011 competition. Hans Gatt won the 2010 race with the fastest finish in Yukon Quest history: 9 days and 26 minutes. That race was marked by good weather, and few mushers dropped out. In 2011, conditions returned to normal, as violent storms blasted the trail and mushers during the second half of the race. Only 13 of the 25 competitors completed the race, tying the record for fewest finishers. In 2013, poor trail conditions over American Summit forced the Dawson to Eagle section of the course to be rerouted over the Yukon River.
Brent Sass became the race&#x27;s third three-time winner in 2020, as the race finished on schedule despite the growing COVID-19 pandemic. For 2021, race officials arranged to hold two separate races—one on the Canadian side of the border and the other on the Alaska side of the border—to abide by international quarantine. This plan was abandoned in September 2020 when the Canadian organizers canceled their race. The American half of the 2021 race is still scheduled for February. 

== Route ==

The course of the race varies slightly from year to year because of ice conditions on the Yukon River, snowfall, and other factors. The length of the route has also fluctuated, ranging from in the weather-shortened 2003 race to in 1998. In even-numbered years, the race starts in Fairbanks and ends in Whitehorse. In odd-numbered years, the start and finish lines switch.

The route follows the Yukon River for much of its course and travels over four mountains: King Solomon&#x27;s Dome, Eagle Summit, American Summit, and Rosebud Summit. Its length is equivalent to the distance between England and Africa, and the distance between some checkpoints is the breadth of Ireland. Racers endure ice, snow, and extreme cold. Wildlife is common on the trail, and participants sometimes face challenges from moose and wolves. Because of the harsh conditions, the Yukon Quest has been called the &quot;most difficult sled dog race in the world&quot; and the &quot;toughest race in the world&quot;.

=== Pre-race preparation ===
Because of the extreme difficulty of the competition, several stages of preparation are needed. The first is the food drop, when mushers and race officials position caches of food and supplies at race checkpoints. This is necessary because mushers may only use their supplies along the route, reflecting the Gold Rush era, when dog trains would resupply at points along the trail. One week after the food drop, all dogs participating in the race undergo a preliminary veterinarian inspection to ensure they are healthy enough to race 1,000 miles in subarctic conditions. The final stage of formal preparation is two days before the race, when mushers pick their starting order from a hat.

=== Whitehorse to Braeburn ===

The modern start/finish in Whitehorse is at Shipyards Park, but the traditional start took place near the former White Pass and Yukon Route train station, which today houses the Canadian offices of Yukon Quest International. Shortly after leaving the starting line, racers follow the frozen Yukon River north out of town. Crossing onto the Takhini River, mushers follow it north to the Klondike-era Overland Trail. Racers take the trail to Braeburn Lodge, the first checkpoint.

This trail segment is about long. The terrain consists of small hills and frequent frozen streams and lakes. When the race runs from Fairbanks to Whitehorse, the Braeburn checkpoint is the site of a mandatory eight-hour stop to ensure the health of mushers&#x27; dogs before the final stage. In odd years, mushers must take a four-hour rest here or at Carmacks. The three minute start time difference is adjusted here. In even years, mushers must take an eight (8) hour rest here before continuing on for the last of the race.

=== Braeburn to Pelly Crossing ===
In the first leg of this, mushers must travel from Bareburn to Carmacks which is . In odd years, mushers have the option of taking their four-hour rest here or at Bareburn. The three minute difference start time is also adjusted if the musher chooses to take their four-hour rest here.
Coming out of Braeburn, competitors cross the Klondike Highway and proceed east for about to Coghlan Lake. From there they turn north, then northwest, and travel along a chain of lakes that stretches for about . They then enter a notorious stretch of heavily forested hills nicknamed &quot;Pinball Alley&quot; for the way the rough terrain bounces sleds into trees, rocks, and other obstacles. Trees are so scarred from repeated sled impacts that they have lost their bark on one side. In 1998, racer Brenda Mackey was jolted around so much by the rough trail that her sled became wedged between two trees, forcing her to cut one down to continue.

After Pinball Alley, racers briefly mush along the Yukon River before climbing the riverbank to the Carmacks checkpoint. They then follow a road for about and turn onto a firebreak trail. After departing the trail, they travel alongside and across the Yukon River to McCabe Creek, the first dog drop on the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route. Leaving McCabe Creek, the race trail parallels a driveway and the Klondike Highway for several miles before turning north to cross the Pelly Burn, an area scorched by a wildfire in 1995. Because the fire destroyed much of the forest in the area, this portion of the trail has few obstacles and is considered fast. From the McCabe Creek site it is about to Pelly Crossing.

=== Pelly Crossing to Dawson City ===

The stretch between Pelly Crossing and Dawson City is the greatest distance between checkpoints of any sled dog competition in the world. Between the two sites are of open trail, marked only by a dog drop at Scroggie Creek, an abandoned gold-mining site activated only during the Yukon Quest.

From Pelly Crossing, mushers travel west on the frozen Pelly River, or on a road that parallels the river if ice conditions are poor. At Stepping Stone, shortly before the Pelly and Yukon rivers meet, they can rest at a hospitality stop before turning north. From Stepping Stone to Scroggie Creek the trail consists of a mining road or &quot;cat&quot; road, named for the Caterpillar tracked mining vehicles that use it. Before organizers coordinated schedules with the mining equipment operators, racers often had to contend with heavy machinery blocking the trail or turning it into a muddy path. The Scroggie Creek dog drop is at the confluence of the Stewart River and Scroggie Creek.

After Scroggie Creek, the trail switches from a westerly direction to almost directly north. At this point, mushers enter the gold-mining district surrounding Dawson City. From the Stewart River adjacent to Scroggie, the trail climbs, crossing the Yukon Territory&#x27;s Black Hills. from Dawson City and from Scroggie Creek, it crosses the Indian River, and mushers begin the climb to King Solomon&#x27;s Dome, the highest point () on the trail. The trail ascends more gradually in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route than in the opposite direction, where mushers have to endure several switchbacks. When mushers start in Whitehorse, they already have gained several thousand feet from the ascent into the Black Hills, including a climb over Eureka Dome. The main difficulties come during the descent from King Solomon&#x27;s Dome to Bonanza Creek, the epicenter of the Klondike Gold Rush. After reaching the creek, mushers thread through an area of mining waste and follow the Klondike River to Dawson City, the halfway point of the race. They are required to rest for 36 hours in Dawson City as a halfway-rest.

=== Dawson City to Eagle ===
The distance from Dawson City to Eagle, the first checkpoint in Alaska for the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route, is . Mushers must rest for four hours in Eagle.

Racers exit Dawson City on the Yukon River and follow it for about to the Fortymile River hospitality stop. The river&#x27;s name comes from its distance from Fort Reliance, an abandoned trading post established in 1874. From the hospitality stop, mushers travel southwest on the Fortymile River in what is one of the coldest portions of the race, because of cold air sinking to the bottom of the river valley. The trail on the river crosses the United States–Canada border, noticeable only because of the border vista, a strip of land cleared of all foliage. Shortly past the border, the river turns northwest, and mushers leave its frozen surface when it meets the Taylor Highway, a road closed to automobile traffic during the winter. As the trail follows the highway for conditions are often hazardous, with high winds and drifting snow that can obscure trail markers. After climbing the American Summit, the trail gradually descends to Eagle, on the banks of the Yukon River.

=== Eagle to Central ===

The route from Eagle to Central covers a distance of . In winter, Eagle is buffeted by high winds and drifting snow funneled through the town by nearby Eagle Bluff, which stands above the Yukon River. Because it is the first stop in the United States, competitors are greeted at Eagle by a United States Department of Homeland Security official who checks passports and entry documents.

After leaving Eagle, mushers travel northwest for on the Yukon River, except for a few short portages. During this stretch, two hospitality stops are available. The first is from Eagle at Trout Creek. The next is Biederman&#x27;s Cabin, the former home of Charlie Biederman, one of the last people to deliver mail by sled dog. (The final sled dog mail route was canceled in 1963, and Biederman&#x27;s sled hangs in the National Postal Museum.) A dog drop site is located from Biederman&#x27;s Cabin at Slaven&#x27;s Cabin, a historic site operated by the National Park Service. Some past Slaven&#x27;s Cabin mushers arrive in Circle, so named because its founders believed it was on the Arctic Circle. (Circle is actually about south of that line.)

From Circle, it is to the checkpoint in Central. Mushers follow Birch Creek south until just before Circle Hot Springs. This area, along with the Fortymile stretch, is considered among the coldest on the trail, and mushers are advised to prepare for temperatures. Turning west, they travel through frozen swamps before reaching the Steese Roadhouse checkpoint in Central. In Central during even years, mushers have the option of taking their four-hour rest here or at Mile 101. If they choose to, the three minute start difference will be subtracted from their rest time.

=== Central to Two Rivers ===

From Central to the final (or first, in the Fairbanks–Whitehorse direction) checkpoint in Two Rivers is . Despite the comparative closeness of the checkpoints and the location of a dog drop between them, this is considered the most difficult stretch of dog sled trail in the world. At this point, mushers must climb the two steepest and most difficult mountains on the trail: Eagle Summit and Rosebud Summit.

After leaving Central, mushers head west, paralleling the Steese Highway, which connects Central and Circle with Fairbanks. The trail travels through frozen swamps, mining areas, and firebreaks for about . Mushers then encounter the Steese Highway for a second time before crossing several creeks to begin the ascent of Eagle Summit. They eventually climb above the tree line and are exposed to the wind as they continue upward. The weather atop Eagle Summit is harsh as this is a convergence zone between the Yukon Flats to the north and the low ground of the Tanana Valley to the south. A differential in the weather within the two valleys causes high winds and precipitation when there is moisture in the atmosphere. The final few hundred yards of the climb consists of a 30-degree slope often scoured to bare rock and tundra by the fierce wind. The crossing point itself is a symmetrical saddle, with two peaks of similar height separated by . The south side of Eagle Summit is not as steep, and mushers generally have an easier time reaching the checkpoint at Mile 101. When descending the steep northern slope of Eagle Summit on the Fairbanks–Whitehorse route, many mushers wrap their sled runners in chains to increase friction and slow the plunge.

The Mile 101 checkpoint is a cabin at mile marker 101 (the distance from Fairbanks) on the Steese Highway. At Mile 101, mushers have the option of taking their four-hour rest during even years. They can also take the rest at Central during even years. Again, the three minute start difference will be subtracted from the race if the musher desires to take their rest here. The cabin gives mushers the opportunity for a short rest between Eagle Summit and Rosebud Summit. The ascent of Rosebud Summit begins about south of the dog drop. It consists of a gradual climb of followed by a steep descent into the valley that contains the north fork of the Chena River. The descent also brings mushers back into forested terrain. The trail then parallels a road for about before entering the final checkpoint at Twin Bears Campground near Two Rivers.

=== Two Rivers to Fairbanks ===

Two Rivers is the final checkpoint in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route. Mushers are required to rest at least eight hours in Two Rivers in odd years to ensure the health of their dogs during the final leg of the race. The terrain in this stretch is among the easiest on the trail, with gently rolling hills and forest which gradually change into an urban landscape as racers approach Fairbanks. The greatest challenge for racers in the Two Rivers area is distinguishing the Yukon Quest trail from other sled dog trails, many of which have similar markings. Mushers have occasionally been deceived by these markings and taken wrong turns.

Beyond Two Rivers, the trail reaches the Chena River northwest of Fairbanks. This is the final stretch, and mushers use the river to enter Fairbanks and reach the finish line, which is on the river itself in the middle of downtown Fairbanks. Regardless of the timing of the finish, several thousand spectators typically gather to watch the first musher cross the finish line.

=== Route changes ===
The 1984 route was slightly different from today&#x27;s. It had just one non-checkpoint dog drop, at the Mile 101 location, and bypassed American Summit, Pelly Junction, and Braeburn. Instead of running through Braeburn, mushers traveled across Lake Laberge for between Whitehorse and Minto. The inaugural race also included a checkpoint at Chena Hot Springs Resort near Fairbanks. This site was moved to nearby Angel Creek after mushers complained that the hot springs melted nearby snow, causing their dogs to become wet—an extreme hazard in sub-freezing temperatures. Two additional dog drops were added for the 1994 race: Biederman&#x27;s Cabin (since replaced by Slaven&#x27;s Cabin) and McCabe Creek. In 1995, the Whitehorse end of the trail was moved away from Lake Laberge to near the Takhini River. Additional changes that year included the rerouting of the trail around the southern and eastern sides of King Solomon&#x27;s Dome south of Dawson City and the introduction of the Scroggie Creek dog drop site on the shore of the Stewart River.

In 1996, the trail was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and a checkpoint was added there, and the Lake Laberge stretch was replaced by a route through Braeburn and along the Dawson-Whitehorse Overland Trail. In 1997, mushers were routed through the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project and to the Alaska town of North Pole before continuing on to Fairbanks. The North Pole loop was removed before the 2009 race, and mushers were directed through Two Rivers instead. Starting in the 2010 race, the Mile 101 location was upgraded from a dog drop to a full-fledged checkpoint. In the past several races, the Two Rivers checkpoint has changed locations annually: from a lodge to a campground, and then to a gravel pit in 2011.

== Weather ==
The Yukon Quest trail is in the subarctic climate range. In Fairbanks, the average February temperature is , but is not uncommon, and temperatures have dropped to . An average of of snow falls in February, with average snowpack depth of .

Outside the sheltered urban areas of Fairbanks, Whitehorse, and Dawson City, temperatures and snowfall are often more extreme. During the 2008 race, competitors started in temperatures in Fairbanks and then faced winds of on the trail, resulting in severe wind chills. At higher elevations, such as the crossings of Rosebud and Eagle summits, whiteout blizzards are common. In the 2006 race, 12 teams were struck by a massive storm that eventually caused the evacuation of seven teams by helicopter. In 2009, mushers endured winds up to , blowing snow, and subzero temperatures atop Eagle Summit, where conditions had been even worse in a storm during the 1988 race, when wind chill temperatures dropped below .

The extreme temperatures pose a serious health hazard. Frostbite is common, as is hypothermia. In the 1988 Yukon Quest, Jeff King suffered an entirely frozen hand because of nerve damage from an earlier injury which left him unable to feel the cold. King said his hand became &quot;like something from a frozen corpse&quot;. In 1989, King and his team drove through a break in the Yukon River in temperatures. Frozen by the extreme cold, King managed to reach a cabin and thaw out. Other racers have suffered permanent damage from the cold: Lance Mackey suffered frostbitten feet during the 2008 Yukon Quest, and Hugh Neff lost the tips of several toes in the 2004 race.

== Participants ==
Since the race&#x27;s inception in 1984, 353 people from 11 countries have competed in the Yukon Quest, some many times. The race attracts from 21 (in 1996) to 47 (in 1988 and 1989) mushers each year. Of the 776 entries from 1984 to 2007, 263 (34%) did not finish. The racers have come from various professions: taxicab drivers, swimming instructors, coal miners, tax assessors, lawyers, fur trappers, journalists, and a car salesman have all entered.

At the end of the competition, racers are given awards for feats performed on the trail. The foremost is the championship award, given to the winner. Accompanying this is the Golden Harness Award, given to the winner&#x27;s two lead sled dogs. The next award is the Veterinarians Choice Award, which is voted on by race veterinarians and given to the musher who took the best care of their dogs during the race. Other awards include the Challenge of the North Award—given to the musher who &quot;exemplifies the spirit of the Yukon Quest&quot;—and the Sportsmanship Award, given to the most sportsmanlike competitor, as chosen by a vote of the mushers.

The Rookie of the Year Award is given to the highest-finishing first-time competitor. The Dawson Award, consisting of four ounces of gold, is given to the first musher to reach Dawson City (the midpoint) who also finishes the competition. The final award is the Red Lantern, given to the last official finisher of the year&#x27;s race. Two awards have been discontinued: the Kiwanis Award, given to the first musher to cross the Alaska–Yukon border, and the Mayor&#x27;s Award, given to the Yukon Quest champion by the Mayor of Fairbanks.

The 2011 Yukon Quest champion is Alaskan Dallas Seavey, who finished the race in 10 days, 11 hours and 53 minutes. Seavey, who has run the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race several times, won the Yukon Quest in his rookie year and therefore also was named rookie of the year. Haliburton, Ontario musher Hank DeBruin won the 2011 Red Lantern Award by finishing the race in 13 days, 10 hours, and 54 minutes. For the first time in Yukon Quest history, more than one musher received the sportsmanship award. Following the 2011 race, Allen Moore, Brent Sass and Mike Ellis shared the honor. Ken Anderson, who reached Dawson City third, was the only one of the top three at that point to finish, and thus received the Dawson Award. Wasilla musher Kelley Griffin received the Spirit of the North award, and the Veterinarian&#x27;s Choice award was given to Mike Ellis and his wife/handler Sue Ellis.

=== Dogs ===
Dogs in the Yukon Quest come in a variety of sizes and breeds, though the most common are Alaskan and Siberian Huskies weighing between . The Alaskan Husky is not a recognized breed, but an amalgam of several different types bred for speed, stamina, and strength. Siberian Huskies are a breed recognized by the American Kennel Club and are characterized by thick coats, stiff ears, a fox-like tail, and medium size. Siberian Huskies are typically larger and slower than their Alaskan counterparts, causing mushers to nickname the breed &quot;Slowberians&quot;, but have more pulling power. The difference was seen during the 1998 Yukon Quest, when Bruce Lee&#x27;s team of Alaskan Huskies competed against André Nadeau&#x27;s team of Siberians. Lee&#x27;s team was faster than Nadeau&#x27;s over short stretches, but Lee had to rest more often. Nadeau had a head start out of the final checkpoint, but Lee was able to overtake him.

== Rules ==
The Yukon Quest encourages participants&#x27; self-sufficiency, and one of its objectives is &quot;[to] encourage and facilitate knowledge and application of the widest variety of bush skills and practices that form the foundation of Arctic survival.&quot; On the trail, racers may not accept outside assistance and are limited in the changes they may make to their teams and sled. There are 10 checkpoints and four additional locations where sick or injured dogs may be dropped from a team. Only four checkpoint stops are mandated: a 36-hour stop at Dawson City; a four-hour stop in Eagle, Alaska; a two-hour stop at the first checkpoint; and an eight-hour stop at the last.

As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers must carry an axe, a cold-weather sleeping bag, a pair of snowshoes, veterinary records, Quest promotional material, a cooker, and eight booties per dog. Included in the required promotional material are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest&#x27;s ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself.

=== Entry requirements ===
Competitors must meet a series of written and unwritten requirements before entering. The first is that each musher must have a team of dogs. The race does not furnish any dogs, but participants have been known to lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise their own. In the 2009 Yukon Quest, for example, Newton Marshall from the Jamaica Dogsled Team borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt. Each competitor must have completed at least two sled dog races sanctioned by Yukon Quest International: one of and one of . Sanctioned races include the Copper Basin 300 and the Tustumena 200, Alaska races held before the Quest.

Those who have completed at least of Quest-sanctioned racing are eligible to send in an entry form. This requires entrants to certify that they are older than 18, have not been censured by the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, and have never been convicted of animal abuse or neglect. They must pay $1,500 or $2,000 for late entries.

=== Dog health ===

Many of the Quest&#x27;s rules are intended to ensure the health of dogs in hazardous conditions. This process begins before the race, when all dogs must be examined by race veterinarians, who certify that the animals are suited and healthy enough to participate. Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher must carry an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.

Mushers must start the race with at most fourteen dogs and finish with no fewer than six in harness (additional dogs may be carried in the sled basket). Dogs are visually examined by veterinarians stationed at every checkpoint, and mushers can be ejected and banned from the race for mistreating dogs. Dog whips and forced feeding are forbidden. Participating dogs may not receive injections during the race or be under the influence of performance-enhancing substances such as steroids. The race marshal may remove any team from the race for violations of these rules or substandard dog care.

Organization officials and race veterinarians award one team each year with the Humanitarian Award for exemplary dog care. In 2023 the team of Amanda Otto, who placed second, was in such good condition at the end of the race, still yelping and pulling, that she was awarded in the first unanimous decision in race history.

=== Penalties ===
The Yukon Quest&#x27;s rules allow race officials latitude on whether to assess a time penalty or monetary fine on mushers who violate one or more regulations. The most serious penalties can be assessed for mistreating dogs. Racers have been forcibly removed from the race for inadequate dog care; the most recent instance of this took place in 2008, when Donald Smidt was removed. More common are minor time and monetary penalties. For example, Dan Kaduce was fined $500 of his eventual $9,000 winnings for missing roll call at a mandatory meeting in 2007. Fines of $500 also have been levied for not attending the finish banquet, littering, not wearing start and finish bibs, or losing veterinary records. These minor penalties can have an effect on the race. In 2009, Hugh Neff, then in second place, was penalized two hours for mushing on the Circle Hot Springs road. As a result, he finished four minutes behind Sebastian Schnuelle, the winner.

== Junior Yukon Quest and Yukon Quest 300 == 
In addition to the main 1,000-mile sled dog race, the Yukon Quest organization operates two shorter races: the Junior Yukon Quest and the Yukon Quest 300. The two began in 2000, though in its first three years the Quest 300 was only 250 miles and thus known as the Quest 250.

=== Junior Yukon Quest ===
The Junior Yukon Quest, or Junior Quest, is a race for mushers older than 14 but under 18. Unlike the Yukon Quest, the Junior Quest does not change locations and always starts and ends in Fairbanks. It is billed as an opportunity for young racers to experience a mid-distance sled dog race. They must plan a food drop, camp away from checkpoints, and carry much of the same equipment as mushers in the Yukon Quest and Yukon Quest 300.

=== Yukon Quest 300 ===
The Yukon Quest 300 is a race along the regular Yukon Quest trail. It alternates starting locations along with the main race and is intended for less-experienced mushers training for longer races. The race is also a qualifier for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and the following year&#x27;s Yukon Quest. Several mushers, including Fort Yukon Native Josh Cadzow, have used the race as a trial before entering the longer races.

In 2009, the race was capped at 25 entries. When the Quest 300 starts in Whitehorse, its course follows the main Yukon Quest trail until the Stepping Stone hospitality stop. From there, it turns southwest, ending in Minto Landing, Yukon. The Fairbanks route follows the main trail to Circle, then reverses course, ending in Central.

<doc id="1251648" wikidata="Q7579384" url="?curid=1251648" title="Sport Select">
<text>Sport Select is a group of sports betting games offered by Canada&#x27;s lottery corporations. In Quebec, the program is known as Pari sportif; in Ontario and Atlantic Canada, it is known as Pro-Line while in British Columbia, it is known as Sports Action. However, the rules for the games are similar in all provinces. Initially created to offer betting primarily on the North American major professional sports leagues, Sport Select has expanded to offer betting on competitions such as the English Premier League and college sports.

Sport Select (or equivalent) tickets are sold across Canada, through Atlantic Lottery Corporation, Loto-Québec, Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, Western Canada Lottery Corporation, and British Columbia Lottery Corporation

. In addition, some provinces are now accepting wagers over the Internet.

==Sport Select games==
Each province offers versions of these three games under rules similar to those described below:

===Pro-Line===
Known as Oddset in British Columbia and Mise-O-Jeu in Quebec, Pro-Line offers fixed-odds sports betting, and is the most popular Sport Select game. It does not offer betting on individual matches, partly because betting on a single sporting event was illegal under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; up until August 27, 2021. Therefore, Pro-Line is a parlay game where bettors wager on the outcome of anywhere from two to six (BC and Atlantic) and three to six (Quebec, Ontario and Western Canada) of the matches offered by the lottery corporation. Decimal odds are quoted for individual matches, the odds for each selection being multiplied to calculate the potential payout of the ticket. For the ticket to pay out, all selections must be correct. Some provinces offer &quot;Combo Play&quot; which does not require all selections to be correct for a payout, but a Combo Play ticket is effectively nothing more than a number of similar, individual Pro-Line tickets rolled into one. Overtime is considered when determining results, but overtime in soccer is not.

In June 2022, Proline sportsbook announced themselves as the first Sportsbook partner of Major League Baseball (MLB) in Ontario. 
===PROLINE+===
On August 27, 2021, the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) launched PROLINE+ to expand the sports betting selection in the province of Ontario. This coincided with the legalization of single-event betting in Canada, which opened the doors for provinces to start regulating and offering single-event betting as they wished. PROLINE+ is a mobile-optimized site that offers betting markets for at least 12 popular sports, including hockey, football, MMA, and tennis. Bettors can also bet live thanks to a built-in live event tracker.

===Point spread===
&quot;Point Spread&quot; is similar to those games offered by other bookmakers where bettors are wagering against a quoted point spread. Bettors can make predictions on the outcomes of two to twelve games, depending on the province. The payouts offered vary by province.

===Over/Under===
Also known as &quot;Total&quot; in Quebec, &quot;Over/Under&quot; is similar to over–under games offered by other bookmakers where bettors are wagering that the number of points scored in each match are over or under the quoted total. Bettors can make predictions on the outcomes of two to twelve games, depending on the province. The payouts offered vary by province.

==Controversy==
===Odds===

In recent years, Sport Select has come under increasingly heavy criticism from Canadian gamblers due to the poor odds it offers (from the gambler&#x27;s perspective). A private bookmaker licensed in the United Kingdom or Nevada generally maintains an overround (or &quot;vig&quot;) of about 110%, meaning the bookmaker can expect to pay out $100 for every $110 that is wagered. In Canada, however, the overround for an individual match in Sport Select odds often exceeds 130%. To make matters worse for the bettor, the parlay requirement compounds the overround - the actual vigorish is a minimum of 160% but can rise to well over 300% (if six selections are made). In jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom where genuine competition is allowed, bookies often pay bonuses for winning parlay bets to help offset the compounded vig. Sport Select does not.

Another controversial frustration for Pro-Line players in Atlantic Canada is the occurrence of Atlantic Lottery (ALC) &#x27;capping&#x27; wagering on combinations and, on rare occasion, individual selections. This occurs when a significant amount of wagering is placed within a short span of time, typically on a specific combination of outcomes. The reasoning behind having such caps is to dissuade professional, or &#x27;block&#x27;, bettors from attempting to take advantage of potential flaws in the posted odds, and thus limits the liability for the corporation on a given combination of outcomes. Typical block betting behaviour involves placing large sums (often thousands of $) on a very small amount of combinations, trying to focus on perceived flaws as much as possible. Ultimately the Pro-Line game is meant to be recreational and not for professionals. Unlike online-only betting operations where all transactions must be submitted by identity verified accounts, Atlantic Lottery operates across a network of retailers where wagers are accepted anonymously, thus making it more susceptible to such &#x27;block&#x27; bettors. The capping of combinations serves to limit pro-betting while keeping all outcomes open for betting, in any other combination. If a combination of outcomes is capped, any subsequent transaction submitted to the system attempting to wager on this particular combination is rejected. This can be an annoyance to non-professional (casual) bettors legitimately trying to wager on a capped combination, but experienced bettors have come to understand the reasoning and adjust their wagers accordingly.

Though most experts agree that the odds offered on Sport Select are such that even the sharpest punter would have no hope of making a profit in the long term, some have. See, for instance, the 2007 Tax Court of Canada case R. v. Leblanc, in which two brothers netted $5.5 million on $50 million in bets over five years. The Tax Court ruled the profit was not taxable.

===Ties===
While ties are a common in soccer and used to be common in ice hockey as well, unlike what would be the case with most bookmakers the rules of Sport Select provide for betting on &quot;ties&quot; in nearly every sport including football, basketball and in some provinces baseball, even though ties are never allowed in basketball or baseball and are rare in football. Consequently, Sport Select mandates that any game decided by five points or less in basketball, three points or less in football or one run in baseball (where applicable) is declared a &quot;tie&quot;. Furthermore, when the NHL introduced shootouts in for the 2005–06 season the lottery corporations (in contrast to most bookmakers) quickly ruled that shootout results would &quot;not&quot; count, specifically so they could keep offering &quot;ties&quot; in hockey. In Ontario, a hockey game that goes to a shootout counts as both a Tie and a Visitor or Home win, depending on the outcome. The rule is loathed by most Canadian gamblers because the size of the winning margin often means little to the teams on the field/court. Many bettors believe the rule&#x27;s true purpose is to confuse gamblers and allow for larger vigs.

===NBA===
Wagering on NBA games was an issue when Toronto and Vancouver were being considered for NBA expansion franchises, due to strict league rules at the time which prohibited gambling. The Toronto Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies began play in the league in 1995 only after the provincial lottery corporations agreed to stop offering wagering on all NBA games. As part of the agreement, the Raptors paid $5 million in its first three years and $1 million annually afterwards to its charitable foundation to compensate the Ontario provincial lottery corporation for its loss of revenue.

When the Grizzlies relocated to Memphis in 2001, British Columbia resumed allowing wagering on NBA games. In 2010, it was revealed that the Ontario Lottery Gaming Corporation and the Raptors were in negotiations to return wagering on NBA games to the province. In September 2016, it was announced that an agreement had been reached between the parties to allow betting on NBA games on Pro-Line in Ontario to resume beginning with the 2016–17 season. The move is projected to generate $5–10 million in profit for the province.

<doc id="1251650" wikidata="Q1371303" url="?curid=1251650" title="Ethnarch">
<text>Ethnarch (pronounced , also ethnarches, ) is a term that refers generally to political leadership over a common ethnic group or homogeneous kingdom. The word is derived from the Greek words (&quot;ethnos&quot;, &quot;tribe/nation&quot;) and (&quot;archon&quot;, &quot;leader/ruler&quot;). &quot;Strong&#x27;s Concordance&quot; gives the definition of &#x27;ethnarch&#x27; as &quot;the governor (not king) of a district&quot;.

==Antiquity==
The title first appeared in the Hellenistic Middle East, possibly in Judea. In the First book of Maccabees the word is used three times (1 Maccabees 14:47 and 15:1-2), where Simon Thassi is referred to as the high priest and ethnarch of the Judeans.

It was used in the region even after it fell under the dominion of Rome, and into the early Roman Empire, to refer to rulers of vassal kingdoms who did not rise to the level of kings. The Romans used the terms &quot;natio&quot; and &quot;gens&quot; for a people as a genetic and cultural entity, regardless of political statehood.

The best-known is probably Herod Archelaus, son of Herod the Great, who was ethnarch of Samaria, Judea (Biblical Judah), and Idumea (Biblical Edom), from the death of his father in 4 BC to AD 6. This region is known as the Tetrarchy of Judea. His brother Philip received the north-east of the realm and was styled Tetrarch (circa &#x27;ruler of a quarter&#x27;); and Galilee was given to Herod Antipas, who bore the same title. Consequently, Archelaus&#x27; title singled him out as the senior ruler, higher in rank than the tetrarchs and the chief of the Jewish nation; these three sovereignties were in a sense reunited under Herod Agrippa from AD 41 to 44.

Previously, Hyrcanus II, one of the later Hasmonean rulers of Judea, had also held the title of ethnarch, as well as that of High Priest.

In the New Testament the word is used only once by the Apostle Paul in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11:32). However the definition of the word in terms of the actual jurisdiction and public office of the ethnarch may not be accurately determined.

==Byzantine Empire==
The Byzantines used the term generically to refer to the rulers of barbarian tribes or realms outside the boundaries of their empire. In a Christian context, where &quot;ethnikos&quot; meant &quot;pagan,&quot; some Church Fathers used the term &quot;ethnarches&quot; to designate pagan national gods. In the 10th century, the term acquired a more technical sense, when it was given to several high-ranking commanders. Although the specific nature of the title is not attested, it is generally accepted that in the 10th–11th centuries, it signified the commanders of the contingent of foreign mercenaries serving in the Byzantine army.

==Ottoman Empire==
Rather different was the case of minority community ethnarchs, especially within the Islamic Ottoman Empire that were recognized as legitimate entities (&quot;millet&quot;) and thus allowed to be heard by the government through an officially acknowledged representative, though without political persona.

When the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II decided to give such dialogue a more formal nature, the logical choice for the major Orthodox Christian communities was the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. The non-Chalcedonian Christians (Armenians, Syriacs, and Copts) were represented by the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople. For the far smaller, but also influential Jewish diaspora, a similar position was granted to the &quot;Hakham Bashi&quot;, i.e., chief rabbi.

==Modern Greece and Cyprus==
In modern Greek usage, the term has the connotation of &quot;father of the nation&quot;, and has been widely used as an epithet applied to perhaps the most influential political leader in modern Greek history: Eleftherios Venizelos. In more recent times, it has also been attributed to Konstantinos Karamanlis.

In the context of modern Cyprus, the term nearly always refers to Archbishop Makarios. Makarios was the last Archebishop to hold a double religious (Archebishop) and political (Leader of the Greek Cypriots) role under foreign rule, similar to the Ecumenical Patriarch under the Millet system. This regime, called the Ethnarchy, was retained during the British rule in Cyprus and survived in practice until independence in 1960. Additionally, Makarios became the first President of Cyprus after independence.

Unlike Venizelos and Karamanlis, who are rarely ever called ethnarches in such uses, streets of major Greek cities are named after Makarios:

<text>David Turnbull (born March 17, 1942) is a former Canadian politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2003 and was a candidate for the Conservative Party of Canada in the federal election of 2004.

==Background==
Turnbull was educated at the Edinburgh College of Domestic Sciences, and worked as a hotel manager in Scotland, Switzerland and Germany. Upon moving to Canada, he continued his education at the Canadian Institute of Management. Before entering public life, he served as a manager for Xerox Canada Ltd. and as President of Turnbull Luetolf Ltd. He also became involved in conservative citizens&#x27; groups, including the Ratepayers&#x27; Association and the Citizens for Property Tax Reform.

==Politics==
Turnbull was elected to the provincial legislature in the 1990 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal Brad Nixon by about 3,000 votes in the North York riding of York Mills. The election was won by the New Democratic Party, and Turnbull sat in the opposition benches for the next five years.

The Tories won a majority government in the provincial election of 1995, and Turnbull was re-elected by more than 11,000 votes over his nearest opponent. He was appointed Government Whip in 1995, and retained this position on being named a Minister without Portfolio in Mike Harris&#x27;s government on October 10, 1997.

In 1999, Turnbull was re-elected in the redistributed Don Valley West riding, outpolling Liberal candidate Paul Davidson by over 3,000 votes.

On June 17, 1999, Turnbull was promoted to Minister of Transportation, and on February 8, 2001, was named to the position of Solicitor General. In the latter capacity, he was responsible for creating the province&#x27;s first Sex Offender Registry.

When Ernie Eves succeeded Harris as Premier of Ontario on April 15, 2002, he named Turnbull as his Associate Minister of Enterprise, Opportunity and Innovation. Turnbull held this position until the defeat of the Eves government in the 2003 provincial election.

Turnbull was among the Tory incumbents defeated in the 2003 election, falling to Liberal candidate Kathleen Wynne by over 6,000 votes. He sought election to House of Commons of Canada for the federal Don Valley West riding the following year, but was defeated by Liberal incumbent John Godfrey.

<text>Chinese Burmese, also Sino-Burmese or Tayoke (), are Burmese citizens of Han Chinese ethnicity. They are a group of overseas Chinese born or raised in Myanmar (Burma).

Burmese Chinese are a well established middle class ethnic group and are well represented in all upper levels of Burmese society. Burmese Chinese also play a leading role in Burma&#x27;s business sector and dominate the Burmese economy. In addition, Burmese Chinese have a strong presence in Burma&#x27;s political scene with several people such as San Yu, Khin Nyunt, and Ne Win having been major political figures.

==Etymology==

In the Burmese language, the Chinese are called &quot;Tayoke&quot; (, &quot;tarut&quot;, ) and formerly spelt (&quot;tarup&quot;). The earliest evidence of this term dates to the Bagan Era, in the 13th century, during which it referred to the territory and a variety of peoples to the north and northeast of Myanmar. Various scholars have proposed that it comes from the Chinese term for &quot;Turk&quot; (突厥, &quot;Tūjué&quot; / &quot;tú jué&quot;); from the name of Dali (大理國, &quot;Dàlǐguó&quot;), the capital of the Kingdom of Nanzhao; a Chinese corruption of the term &quot;Dàyuèzhī&quot; (大月支 or 大月氏), a Chinese term referring to Mongol-speaking Kushan Huns. The adoption of &quot;Tayoke&quot; as an exonym for the Han Chinese was not an established practice until the 19th century.

In the 1940s and 1950s, the term &quot;paukphaw&quot; (, ) was co-opted as an affectionate term for the Chinese, and is now typically used in the context of diplomatic ties between China and Myanmar. The term itself purportedly originates from a Burmese myth about the Chinese and Burmese peoples as being descendants of the same parents, a dragon princess and a sun god.

In the Mon language, the Chinese are known as &quot;Krawk&quot; (, ); in Shan, they are called &quot;Khe&quot; (, ). In the Wa language, spoken in the borderlands between Yunnan Province and Shan State, the word for Chinese is &quot;Hox/Hawx&quot;, pronounced .

==Ancestral origins==
The Hakkas, Hokkiens and Cantonese comprised 45 per cent of the ethnic Chinese population. The Yunnanese comprised 30 to 40 per cent of the ethnic Chinese population.

===Hokkien===

* Hokkiens (Burmese: &quot;eingyi shay&quot;, or &quot;let shay&quot;, , ) from Fujian Province. Most of the Hokkien were traders, bankers and brokers.

===Cantonese===

* Cantonese (Burmese: &quot;eingyi to&quot;, or &quot;let to&quot;, , ) from Central Guangdong Province. Most migrants from Guangdong Province were artisans.

===Hakkas===
* Hakkas (Burmese: &quot;zaka&quot;, , ) from Fujian and Guangdong provinces.

The Hakkas are further subdivided into those with ancestry from Fujian Province and Guangdong Province, called &quot;eingyi shay haka&quot; () and &quot;eingyi to haka&quot; () respectively.

===Kokang===
In Upper Myanmar and Shan Hills, the Kokang people predominate there.

===Panthay===
The Panthay have long been considered distinct from the Han Chinese diaspora community. They are Chinese Muslims who are called Hui in China.

Finally, there are the &quot;tayoke kabya&quot; () of mixed Chinese and indigenous Burmese parentage. The &quot;kabya&quot; (, meaning &quot;hybrid&quot;) have a tendency to follow the customs of the Chinese more than of the Burmese. Indeed, &quot;tayoke kabya&quot; who follow Burmese customs are absorbed into and largely indistinguishable from mainstream Burmese society. A large portion of Burmese Chinese is thought to have some &quot;kabya&quot; blood, possibly because immigrants could acquire Burmese citizenship through intermarriage with the indigenous Burmese peoples.

==History==
===Pre-colonial===
The earliest records of Chinese migration into present-day Myanmar were in the Song and Ming dynasties. In the 18th century, Ming dynasty princes settled in Kokang (the northern part of present-day Myanmar). Chinese traders, however, travelled as far as the capital city as well as northern towns on the Irrawaddy such as Bhamo. Some of them stayed and started a Chinese community at Amarapura, and when King Mindon moved his capital to Mandalay in 1859, the Chinese were the only community that decided to stay behind. Many of their descendants intermarried into the host society and remain important and respected citizens of Amarapura.

===British Colonial period===
Another wave of immigration occurred in the 19th century under the British colonial administration. Britain encouraged immigration of the Indians and Chinese to British Burma, and such incentives for work opportunities and enterprise and for accumulating wealth attracted many Chinese immigrants. They primarily came to Burma via British Malaya. The Chinese quickly became dominant in the highly lucrative rice and gem industries. Many Chinese merchants and traders owning both wholesale and retail businesses. Unlike in British Malaya, where most Chinese were coolie labourers, the Chinese in Burma were largely from the artisan and merchant classes.

They integrated well into Burmese society not least because they, like the Bamar, were of Sino-Tibetan stock and were Buddhists, implicit in the nickname &quot;pauk hpaw&quot; (, lit. &quot;sibling&quot;). During British rule, marriage between the Chinese and Burmese, particularly Chinese men and Burmese women, was the most common form of intermarriage in Burma, as evidenced by a High Court ruling on the legal status of Sino-Burmese marriages under Burmese Buddhist law. From 1935 until the end of British rule, the Chinese were represented in the colonial legislature, the House of Representatives.

After World War II, displaced Burmese Chinese (whose pre-war homes were in Burma), were the most numerous group of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia to request repatriation to return to Burma, according to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

===Post-independence===
During the 1950s, Burma was one of the first countries to recognise the People&#x27;s Republic of China as a nation. However, its own Chinese population was treated as aliens. The Burmese Chinese were issued foreign registration cards (FRC) in a tiered citizenship system adopted by the post-independence government. When the Chinese Communists expelled the Kuomintang, many fled to Myanmar and Thailand over the borders of Yunnan Province. The Burmese government fought and removed the armed KMT and forced them to Taiwan; those who managed to stay prospered. In the 1950s, discriminatory policies against overseas Chinese encompassed citizenship, government employment, approval for business regulations and licensing, loan extensions and permission to make remittances.

Within every Burmese city and town, stood Chinese-owned general merchandise stores as 40 percent of Burmese Chinese acted as merchants and traders across the country following the Second World War. Chinese-style bakeries and patisseries, noodle stalls, watch repair shops, cosmetic retailers, and grocery stores became focal points of economic life throughout small towns in Burma. With growing ambitions, Chinese immigrants sought more aggressive entrepreneurial and investment dealings by venturing into most profitable business opportunities, such as liquour stores and pawn brokerage houses.

In 1952, Kheng Hock Keong Temple publications estimated that ethnic Chinese, who lived in enclaves in the area along Sinohdan, Latha, and Maung Khaing Streets (with Cantonese typically living above Maha Bandula Road and Hokkiens living below), constituted 9.5 per cent of Rangoon&#x27;s population. During this period, there was a sharp rise in the number of private Chinese language schools, primarily teaching Mandarin, in Burma, from 65 in 1935 to 259 in 1953 and 259 at its peak in 1962, with many such schools affiliated to the Chinese nationalist (, lit. &quot;White Chinese&quot;) or communist (, lit. &quot;Red Chinese&quot;) movements. However, fewer than 10 per cent of Burmese Chinese of school age attended Chinese language schools. Similarly, about 80 clan associations operated in the 1950s.

===Socialist rule===
In 1962, Ne Win led the Socialist coup d&#x27;état, establishing the Revolutionary Council under the Burmese Way to Socialism. In February 1963, the Enterprise Nationalization Law was passed, effectively nationalising all major industries and prohibiting the formation of new factories. This law adversely affected many industrialists and entrepreneurs, especially those without the full citizenship. The government&#x27;s economic nationalisation program further prohibited foreigners, including the non-citizen Chinese, from owning land, sending remittances, getting business licences and practising medicine. Such policies led to the beginnings of a major exodus of Burmese Chinese to other countries—some 100,000 Chinese left Burma.

Although a &quot;kabya&quot; himself, Ne Win banned Chinese-language education and created other measures to compel the Chinese to leave. Ne Win&#x27;s government stoked up racial animosity and ethnic conflicts against the Indians and Chinese Burmese, who were terrorised by Burmese citizens, the most violent riots taking place in 1967. All schools were nationalised, including Chinese language schools. Beginning in 1967 and continuing throughout the 1970s, anti-Chinese riots as well as Anti-Indian sentiment continued to flare up and many believed they were covertly supported by the government. Similarly, Chinese shops were looted and set on fire. Public attention was successfully diverted by Ne Win from the uncontrollable inflation, scarcity of consumer items and rising prices of rice. The 1982 Citizenship Law further restricted Burmese citizenship for Burmese Chinese and severely limited them from attending professional tertiary schools. During this period, the country&#x27;s failing economy and widespread discrimination accelerated an emigration of Burmese Chinese out of Burma.

===Modern era===
In 1988, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) came to power, and gradually loosened the government&#x27;s role in the economy, encouraging private sector growth and foreign investment. This liberalisation of state&#x27;s role in the economy, if slight and uneven, nonetheless gave the ethnic Chinese-led businesses extra space to expand and reassert their economic power. Today, the majority of retail, wholesale and import trade businesses are run by the Burmese Chinese today.

Despite their status as alien minorities, the close relationship between the military rulers of Burma and the People&#x27;s Republic of China led to the issues of Burmese Chinese being treated with more sensitivity. Furthermore, Beijing pushed reform for the Chinese disapora in the 1980s and Chinese companies tended to hire ethnic Chinese.

Today, the majority of Burmese Chinese live in the major cities of Yangon, Mandalay, Taunggyi, Bago, and their surrounding areas. Although there are Chinatowns (; &quot;tayoke tan&quot;) in the major cities, the Chinese are widely dispersed throughout the country. Yangon is home to nearly 100,000 Chinese. The northern region of Myanmar has seen a recent influx of mainland Chinese migrant workers, black market traders and gamblers. In Kachin State, which borders China in three directions, Standard Chinese is the lingua franca.

Upper Myanmar has seen a demographic shift resulting from the recent immigration of many mainland Chinese to Mandalay Region, Shan, and Kachin States. Ethnic Chinese now constitute an estimated 30 to 40 per cent of Mandalay&#x27;s population. Huge swaths of land in city centre left vacant by the fires were later illegally purchased, mostly by the ethnic Chinese, many of whom were recent illegal immigrants from Yunnan. The Chinese influx accelerated after the current military government came to power in 1988. The government forcibly relocated local Burmese to satellite towns as part of a City Beautification and Development Program, allowing incoming Chinese immigrants access to land in central Mandalay. In the 1990s alone, about 250,000 to 300,000 Yunnanese were estimated to have migrated to Mandalay. The Mandalay&#x27;s population from about 500,000 in 1980 to one million in 2008 and the percentage of local Burmese reduced to less than 50. Chinese festivals are now firmly embedded in the city&#x27;s cultural calendar. Mainland Chinese immigrants into Mandalay of this time, came with capital to purchase prime real estate allowing them to take over central Mandalay during the economic crises of the early 1990s. The predominance of Chinese became a source of racial tensions between the two communities.

==Socioeconomics==
===Education===
The Burmese Chinese place a high importance on education and represent a disproportionately high share of those with advanced (medical, engineering or doctorate) degrees in Myanmar. The figure would be higher still had it not been for the longstanding ban on those without Burmese citizenship from pursuing advanced degrees when Ne Win instigated the 1982 Citizenship Law further restricted Burmese citizenship for Burmese Chinese (as it stratified citizenship into three categories: full, associate, and naturalised) and severely limited Burmese Chinese, especially those without full citizenship and those holding FRCs, from attending professional tertiary schools, including medical, engineering, agricultural and economics institutions. But related to the nationalization and indigenization policies, it is important to note that while Chinese communities were significantly impacted, Indians faced even greater challenges. Many wealthy Sino-Burmese families send their children to the city&#x27;s English language schools for primary and secondary education and Chinese and Singaporean Universities for education. Presently, many wealthy Burmese Chinese send their children overseas—in particular to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, for advanced studies. Taiwan is also a major destination, as the Taiwanese government offers aid and scholarship incentives to &#x27;returning&#x27; overseas Chinese to study and settle there.

Until vast nationalisation by the Ne Win&#x27;s government happened in 1963, most Burmese Chinese were enrolled in schools where Mandarin Chinese was the medium of instruction with Burmese as a second language. Notable Chinese schools at that time include:
* Burma-Chinese High School (緬甸華僑中學)
* Nanyang High School (緬甸南洋中學)- now Basic Education High School No. 2 Bahan
* Rangoon Chinese Elementary School (仰光華僑小學)
* Kee Mei Elementary School (仰光集美小學)

===Historical employment===

Historically, Burmese Chinese have made their livelihoods as merchants, traders, and shopkeepers as well as manual labourers such as indentured labourers (pejoratively called &quot;coolies&quot;); dockers, municipal workers, rickshaw men, and pony cart drivers. They were also heavily represented in certain professions such as civil servants, university lecturers, pharmacists, opticians, lawyers, engineers, and doctors. In Yangon, the Hokkien community was the dominant business force amongst the Chinese with the Cantonese occupying a smaller niche of artisan and cottage industries.

Between 1895 and 1930, Chinese-owned Burmese businesses were initially concentrated within the brokerage, manufacturing, and contracting sectors. Under British colonial rule, the Chinese share of the businesses was reduced in all sectors, but most significantly from 28.5 to 10 percent in manufacturing, 26.6 to 1.8 percent in brokerage, and 31 to 4.3 percent in contracting while Burmese Indians improved their economic positions and controlled a larger proportion of these businesses. The Chinese share of banking, previously at 33.3 percent, was eliminated. However, their share increased in industries like milling, agents, merchanting and most substantially in shop-keeping- which went from 6.7 to 18.3 percent. Of the 47 rice mills in Burma, 13 percent of them were Chinese controlled and were utilized for rice exportation and processing by Chinese rice merchants. During the last few decades of the 19th century, the Chinese diversified into rural money-lending and agenting for petroleum and natural gas. Some businessmen also ran illicit opium and gambling dens, teahouses and liquor stores.

===Commerce and industry===

Like much of Southeast Asia, ethnic Chinese form a dominant minority in Burmese commerce at every level of society. According to Amy Chua&#x27;s 2003 book &quot;World on Fire&quot;, entrepreneurial savvy Chinese have &quot;literally taken over the country&#x27;s entire economy.&quot; According to a 2015 presentation by Professor Choi Ho Rim, the contemporary Burmese Chinese are estimated to effectively control approximately 76 percent of the nation&#x27;s entire economy. Chinese enclaves have sprung up across major cities throughout the country.

After the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) came to power in 1988 and liberalised the economy, Chinese-owned Burmese businesses gain a slight but significant leeway to expand and ultimately assert their economic clout. For example, Sein Gay Har, a major Burmese retailer that began in Yangon&#x27;s Chinatown in 1985, is owned by a Burmese family of Hakka ancestry. Moreover, Burmese businessmen of Chinese ancestry control the nations four of the five largest commercial banks, Myanmar Universal Bank, Yoma Bank, Myanmar Mayflower Bank, and the Asia Wealth Bank. As the indigenous Bamars were known for their graceful hospitality towards non-Burmese ethnics, newly settled Han Chinese immigrants began to capitalize on business opportunities and carving out niches that the Chinese community were well known for specializing in following Burma&#x27;s acceptance of free-market capitalism in 1988.

Many artisan products historically produced by the indigenous Burmans have been entirely displaced by cheaper and higher-quality Chinese consumer imports. Chinese equipment imported, however, tend to be low-quality with such exports being produced in exchange for high-quality exports to China. Burmese entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry have become dominant figures in key industries following the economic liberalisation of the State Peace and Development Council rule in 1989. These include the timber industry- primarily teak- and gemstones- primarily rubies.
The Chinese have been the chief driving force behind Burma&#x27;s gem mining industry and jade exports. Burma&#x27;s booming gem industry is operated by Chinese hands at every level, from the financiers and concession operators to retail merchants of newly opened gem markets. One Chinese-owned jewelry company reportedly controls 100 gem mines and produces over 2,000 kilograms of raw rubies annually.

The autarky of Ne Win&#x27;s rule gave Chinese-owned small businesses like restaurants, karoake bars and hotels an advantage in the late 1980s onwards as all businesses had to be built up from nothing. Burmese-Chinese also have small businesses like hawkers who sell bicycle tires or new Chinese immigrant farmers growing rice in northern Burma.

Businessman Lo Hsing Han and industrialist Kyaw Win, are prominent examples of Burma&#x27;s native-born tycoons of Chinese ancestry. Working with and bribing the SLORC government, these men have come to manage major banks, airlines such as Yangon Airways, teak logging companies, gemstone mining concessions. Lo was also an opium warlord, gaining economic clout by cutting deals with the government to resolve conflict in his native Kokang. Like him, many Chinese Burmese dominate the black market of Myanmar like any other economic industry. Lo&#x27;s son, Steven Law is also a prominent businessman well known for being at the helm of Burma&#x27;s largest conglomerate company Asia World, whose investments include a container shipping line, port buildings, and toll road authorities.

 While Chinese Burmese communities are often portrayed as dominating Myanmar&#x27;s economy, this narrative oversimplifies the situation. Chinese companies’ economic involvement has been deeply tied to Myanmar&#x27;s political economy, particularly through dealings with the military government. Such actions have increasingly been viewed by locals as complicity with the regime. However, it is crucial to distinguish between the activities of Chinese-backed corporations and the experiences of the broader Chinese Burmese community, who face complex socioeconomic realities that cannot be reduced to economic dominance.

===Migrants to Mandalay===

Mandalay remains Burma&#x27;s major financial and networking hub for Burmese businessmen and investors of Chinese ancestry with thousands of prospering Chinese businesses in the city. Chinese-owned shops make up 50% of downtown economic activity, with 70% of restaurants and almost all Chinese-made commodity sale centres in the whole city being Chinese-owned.

Over the last 30 years, the entrepreneurial Chinese minority transformed Mandalay into a booming modern metropolis filled with foreign businesses and gem trading centers. The country&#x27;s post-1988 economic liberalization and Burma&#x27;s open-door immigration policy attracted many poor Chinese migrants from Yunnan in search of economic opportunity who brought talent, skills, goods and services, and capital, reshaping Mandalay&#x27;s economic landscape. Arriving impoverished, Burmese businessmen of Chinese ancestry now sit at the helm of the Burmese economy as a prosperous business community. Following Burma&#x27;s new market transformation, Chinese immigrants from Yunnan were able to illegally obtain identity cards on the black market to become naturalized Burmese citizens overnight. A substantial increase in foreign direct investment has poured in from mainland China, mostly ending up in Mandalay&#x27;s real estate sector, through Burmese citizen intermediaries of Chinese ancestry. As Mandalay became more economically prosperous, existing Burmese Chinese have facilitated continued immigration from China.

Prime real estate in central Mandalay have been bought by wealthy Chinese businessmen and investors. Large commercial real estate projects, such as hotels or shopping centres, are typically developed by Chinese businessmen and real estate investors. The Burmese Chinese business community&#x27;s impact on the city&#x27;s development has also been amplified by additional investment from mainland and overseas Chinese investment through bamboo networks. The influence of mainland China is felt throughout the city, leading locals to call Mandalay a &quot;Chinese city&quot;.

Recent immigrants from China move to Mandalay for business, without intent to settle there. These &quot;new Chinese&quot; move into new Chinese neighbourhoods outside Mandalay, as the central city&#x27;s Burmese Chinese areas are too expensive for them. Tensions have grown between local Burmese and new Chinese businesspeople due to cultural differences.

===Bamboo network===
Much of the influx of foreign investment capital into the Burmese economy from mainland and overseas Chinese investors have been channelled through the bamboo network to help launch new companies and executing potential business acquisitions. Burmese Chinese network not just with each other, but also with senior Burmese government officials through activities like golf. Moreover, Chinese-owned Burmese businesses form a part of the larger business network of overseas Chinese firms operating in the markets of Greater China and Southeast Asia that also share common ties.

Local Chinese-owned businesses, like noodle stalls and bakeries, that emerged after World War II became focal points of economic life in small towns throughout Burma. Today, Burma&#x27;s Chinese community is at the forefront of opening up the country&#x27;s economy to conduct foreign business and direct investment, especially catering it towards foreign ethnic Chinese investors, serving as an international overseas Chinese economic outpost. Despite their status as alien minorities, the close relationship between Myanmar&#x27;s military rulers and the People&#x27;s Republic of China helped push reform for the Chinese disapora in the 1980s. In additional, Chinese companies tended to hire ethnic Chinese. The rise of China in the 2010s and the influx of &quot;new Chinese&quot; have created unease among the Burmese Chinese who both welcome increased cultural understanding and fear animosity to China&#x27;s policies being directed at all people of Chinese descent.

Beyond sharing a common ethnic ancestry, cultural, linguistic, and familial ties, many Burmese entrepreneurs and investors of Chinese ancestry are strong adherents of the Confucian paradigm of interpersonal relationships when doing business with each other. They believed that the underlying source for entrepreneurial and investment success relied on the cultivation of personal relationships.

In the early 2000s, the Burmese Chinese Chamber of Commerce was founded. It acts as a guild, business networking centre and commercial lookout helping local Business businessmen and ethnic Chinese investors to secure and protect shared economic interests.

===Burmese attitudes and responses===
The 8888 Uprising saw Burmese political literature that expressed anti-Chinese sentiment, with many reflecting on &quot;public outrage&quot; at the takeover of Mandalay by Chinese migrants who care not for cultural preservation or local morality. Underlying resentment and bitterness from the impoverished Burmese majority has been accumulating as indigenous Burmese lack substantial business equity in Burma and have not profited from economic liberalisation like the Burmese Chinese.

Chinese economic clout in cities like Mandalay grew at the same time that State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) junta forcibly relocated Burmese as a means of social control. During the Burmese property boom in the 1990s, Chinese real estate investors began building and speculating as property values doubled and tripled, which resulted indigenous Burmese being pushed further away from the city center of Mandalay. The increased economic clout held in the hands of the Chinese in Burma has triggered distrust, envy, resentment and anti-Chinese hostility among the indigenous Burmese majority. According to Amy Chua, the free market liberalization under SLORC rule brought virtually no economic benefit to the Bamar majority but rather the domination and looting of their country by a small handful of outsiders. Many Bamar are additionally unhappy from the dominance of Chinese language, food and a perceived lack of adherence to traditional tenets of Burmese Buddhism by the Chinese community in Mandalay.

==Culture==

===Language===

Most Burmese Chinese speak Burmese in their daily life. Those with higher education also speak Standard Chinese and/or English. The use of Chinese dialects still prevails. Hokkien (a dialect of Min Nan from Quanzhou, Zhangzhou and Jinjiang) and Taishanese (a Yue dialect akin to Cantonese) from Taishan and Xinhui are mostly used in Yangon as well as in Lower Myanmar, while Yunnanese Mandarin is well preserved in Upper Myanmar.

Although General Ne Win&#x27;s rule (1962–1988) enacted the ban on Chinese-language schools that caused a decline of Mandarin speakers, the number of Chinese schools is growing again. (Note: Standard Chinese refers to the national language of the PRC and Taiwan, distinct from the Southwestern Mandarin dialect of the Upper Myanmar, Kokang and Panthay). At the end of 2012, Mizzima News reported that an increasing number of young Burmese Chinese are expressing interest in Chinese language, taking language courses even when their parents don&#x27;t understand Chinese. However, this trend is not necessarily indicative of an interest in joining Chinese community or cultural organisations, as many of their parents did. Groups like the Myanmar Overseas Young Chinese League report a lack of interest from Burmese Chinese youth.

===Religion===
Most Burmese Chinese practice Theravada Buddhism, while incorporating some Mahayana Buddhist and Taoist beliefs including ancestral worship. There are also some prominent Theravadin Buddhist meditation teacher of Chinese descent like Sayadaw U Tejaniya. There are several notable Chinese temples situated in Yangon, including Fushan Temple (dedicated to Qingshui Zhushi), Kheng Hock Keong Temple (dedicated to Mazu) and Guanyin Gumiao Temple (dedicated to Guanyin).

The minority Panthay or Chinese Muslims (回教華人; , lit. &quot;little flowers&quot;) originated from Yunnan are mainly Muslim.

===Names===
The Burmese Chinese have Burmese names and many also have Chinese names. Given names in various Chinese dialects are often transliterated into the Burmese language, using phonetic transcriptions or translated. For example, a Burmese Chinese person named &#x27;Khin Aung&#x27; may have the Chinese name of 慶豐 (Hokkien POJ: Khèng-hong), with &#x27;慶&#x27; (Hokkien POJ: khèng) corresponding to &#x27;Khin&#x27;, and &#x27;豐&#x27; (Hokkien POJ: hong) corresponding to &#x27;Aung&#x27;. However, variations of transcription do exist (between dialects), and some Burmese Chinese do not choose to adopt similar-sounding Burmese and Chinese names. Because the Burmese lack surnames, many Burmese Chinese tend to pass on portions of their given names to future generations, for the purpose of denoting lineage.

According to publications of Long Shan Tang, a clan association based in Yangon, the ten most common Chinese surnames in Yangon are:
# Lee/Li (李)
# Peng/Pang (彭)
# Shi/See/Si (時)
# Dong/Tung (董)
# Min/Man (閔)
# Niu/Ngau (牛)
# Pian/Pin (邊)
# Hsin (辛)
# Kwan (關)
# Khaw (許)

In Myanmar, the majority of Chinese surnames are Lim 林, Tan 陈, Yang 杨, Lee 李, Chou 周, Wang 王, Chang 张, Su 苏, Huang 黄, Yeh 叶, Hsu 许, Fang 方 and Wu 吴

===Cuisine===
Burmese Chinese cuisine is based on Chinese cuisine, particularly from Fujian, Guangdong and Yunnan provinces, with local influences. Spices such as turmeric and chili are commonly used. Also, the use of soy sauce, bean curd, bean sprouts, Chinese pickled mustards, and dried mushrooms can be attributed to Chinese influence. The following is a partial list of Chinese contributions to Burmese cuisine. These are an established part of today&#x27;s Burmese cuisine, and are hardly differentiated as a foreign cuisine.

* : steamed buns
* : roasted duck
* : fried Chinese doughnut
* : fried rice
* : mooncake
* : thin rice noodle soup
* : thin wheat noodles
* : rice porridge
* : Panthay-style fried noodles
* : literally &quot;noodles laced in cooked oil,&quot; usually with chicken
* : literally &quot;beehoon soup with chicken or pork,&quot;
* : noodle with thick starchy gravy

==Burmese Chinese outside Myanmar==
There are substantial Burmese Chinese communities outside of Myanmar, particularly in Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, Singapore, United States (such as New York City&#x27;s Henry Street) and Australia. Zhonghe District, near Taipei, Taiwan is home to 40,000 Burmese Chinese (2008), one of the largest communities outside of Myanmar. Huaxin Street is known as &quot;Little Burma&quot;

Like other Southeast Asian businesses owned by those of Chinese ancestry, Chinese-owned businesses in Burma often forge corporate partnerships with Greater Chinese and other overseas Chinese businesses across the globe through bamboo networks in search of new opportunities. However, most wealthy Chinese Burmese businessmen have chosen to stay in Burma or have concentrated their efforts on surrounding Southeast Asian markets such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand as well as the Greater Chinese market. These people also typically have friends and extended family members in mainland China. These connections, alongside the economic conditions brought about by China&#x27;s economic reform since the late 1970s, have allowed them to support their corporate objectives on and private wealth accumulation by introducing the wholesale market of mainland Chinese products into Burma and other Southeast Asian markets.

<text>Nantucket [[Sound_(geography)|Sound]] is a roughly triangular area of the Atlantic Ocean offshore from the U.S. state of Massachusetts. It is long and wide, and is enclosed by Cape Cod on the north, Nantucket on the south, and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard on the west. Between Cape Cod and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard it is connected to the Vineyard Sound. Ports on Nantucket Sound include Nantucket and Hyannis, Massachusetts.

Nantucket Sound possesses significant marine habitat for a diversity of ecologically and economically important species. &quot;The Sound&quot; has particular significance for several federally protected species of wildlife and a variety of commercially and recreationally valuable fisheries.

The Sound is located at a confluence of the cold Labrador Currents and the warm Gulf Stream. This creates a unique coastal habitat representing the southern range for Northern Atlantic species and the northern range for Mid-Atlantic species. Nantucket Sound has much biological diversity and contains habitats that range from open sea to salt marshes, as well as warm-water beaches on the Cape and Islands coasts.
Nantucket Sound is well known for the numerous shoals within its boundaries.

<doc id="1251700" wikidata="Q617059" url="?curid=1251700" title="Humanitarian crisis">
<text>A humanitarian crisis (or sometimes humanitarian disaster) is defined as a singular event or a series of events that are threatening in terms of health, safety or well-being of a community or large group of people. It may be an internal or external conflict and usually occurs throughout a large land area. Local, national and international responses are necessary in such events.

Each humanitarian crisis is caused by different factors and as a result, each different humanitarian crisis requires a unique response targeted towards the specific sectors affected. This can result in either short-term or long-term damage. Humanitarian crises can either be natural disasters, human-made disasters or complex emergencies. In such cases, complex emergencies occur as a result of several factors or events that prevent a large group of people from accessing their fundamental needs, such as food, clean water or safe shelter.

Examples of humanitarian crises include armed conflicts, epidemics, famine, natural disasters, energy crises and other major emergencies. If such a crisis causes large movements of people it could also become a refugee crisis. For these reasons, humanitarian crises are often interconnected and complex and several national and international agencies play roles in the repercussions of the incidences.

==Categories==
There is no simple categorization of humanitarian crises. Different communities and agencies tend to have definitions related to the concrete situations they face. A local fire service will tend to focus on issues such as flooding and weather induced crises. Medical and health related organizations are naturally focused on sudden crises to the health of a community.

Humanitarian crisis may arise from both natural and human-made conflicts and disasters. Humanitarian crisis from natural disasters include tsunami, earthquake, hurricane, floods, droughts, and wildfires that may result in disruption through damage to property, physical injury and death, psychological distress, displacement of individuals and families, and prolonged disruption in normal daily activities. On the other hand, crisis from manmade disasters such as wars, social unrest, protests, conflicts, and terrorist attacks have a broad range of impacts on the physical, mental, and social well-being of the individuals affected.

An ongoing or lingering pandemic may amount to a humanitarian crisis, especially where there are increasing levels of virulence, or rates of infection as in the case of AIDS, bird flu or tuberculosis. Major health-related problems such as cancer, global warming typically require an accentuated or punctuated mass-event to justify a label of &quot;crisis&quot; or &quot;disaster&quot;.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) lists categories which include different types of natural disasters, technological disasters (i.e. hazardous material spills, Chernobyl-type nuclear accidents, chemical explosions) and long-term human-made disasters related to &quot;civil strife, civil war and international war&quot;. Internationally, the humanitarian response sector has tended to distinguish between natural disasters and complex emergencies which are related to armed conflict and wars.

==Impacts==
===Women&#x27;s social status in humanitarian crises===

Socially, women and children (mostly girls) receive a significantly decreased amount of attention in response to humanitarian crises. Women and children make up 3 quarters of refugees or displaced persons at risk post-crisis. A quarter of this population is of reproduction age and a fifth of this population is likely to be pregnant. In times of emergency and such crises, deaths associated with pregnancy, reproductive health, sexual violence and sexual exploitation increase drastically especially amongst females. During such emergencies, women lose access to family planning services, prenatal care, postpartum care and other health services. The heightened risk of female health and safety makes them vulnerable to disease, violence and death.

Non-profit organizations such as the Women&#x27;s Refugee Commission deal with aiding particularly women suffering from various types of humanitarian crises. According to the Women&#x27;s Refugee Commission, during the first hours of a humanitarian crisis, women and young children are at most risk. During such an event, agencies and organizations approach matters variably. However, the top critical requirements within hours and months of the crises include: keeping the refugees and internally displaced persons away from danger, allowing access to fundamental needs such as food and healthcare, identification information, preventing sexual violence and others.

===Socio-economic realities of humanitarian crises===
Economic issues can lead to humanitarian crises or humanitarian crises can lead to economic downfalls. If it occurs after a humanitarian crisis affects a nation, it is imperative to return the livelihoods in the economic settings of the nation. One of the critical needs on the Women&#x27;s Refugee Commission&#x27;s list is providing education and economic opportunities in order to maintain the economic qualities of the region. It is done by using the skills of the displaced persons or refugees involved to provide them with opportunities to gain income.

If it occurs as a cause of humanitarian crisis, the society would have been in a state of civil insecurity and economic shortfalls, which could cause the government to collapse. This can also result from food insecurity, famines, corruptions and various other issues. Direct effects of this situation include human rights violations, violence and mass murders.

The El Niño weather pattern is expected to exacerbate hunger, displacement, and health risks globally. Governments and organizations like the UN Food and Agriculture Organization are focusing on anticipatory action and early response to mitigate the effects of climate-induced damage. 

===Environmental and ecological impacts===
In the cases of humanitarian crises, especially natural disasters such as tornadoes, tsunamis and earthquakes, these incidences leave environmental and ecological impacts on the regions affected. The aftermaths of natural disasters can lead to a significant decrease in natural resources while making the region prone to future issues. For example, if a forest fire occurs in a large region, the area may be susceptible to air pollution, dust clouds, release of carcinogenic gases and others. Forest ecological wildlife, for example, is severely impacted by such events. In the cases of water natural disasters such as floods and tsunamis, extensive damage due to the water is prevalent. Fish, corals and other ocean life is impacted, which further impacts the livelihoods of fishermen.

According to the World Bank data, there is a worrying water scarcity in the Middle East and North Africa. The Stockholm International Water Institute emphasizes the need for urgent action in water policy, and suggests decentralizing decision-making to better manage the crisis.

===Mental health impacts===
Mental health impacts can cause additional concerns for populations affected by humanitarian crises. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that one in five individuals in a disaster-impacted population may already suffer from a mental health disorder that could then be exacerbated by the disaster context. Mental health disorders included in this estimate range from mild anxiety and/or depression to severe and persistent conditions like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

====Acute mental health impacts====
The stress of a humanitarian crisis can cause acute, or short-term, anxiety in the population of people affected. Humanitarian crises often displace people from their homes and cut off their access to resources, which affects their ability to meet their basic needs and creates significant anxiety. This acute anxiety may impact the population&#x27;s capacity to care for themselves via the resources provided by humanitarian aid groups in the short-term. Acute mental health impacts can also hinder a population&#x27;s recovery capacity in rebuilding after a crisis. Acute stress can exacerbate pre-existing conditions for individuals who already suffer from mental health disorders, making serious conditions like depression or schizophrenia more difficult to live with.

====Chronic mental health impacts====
If left untreated, acute mental health impacts from humanitarian crises can become chronic conditions. Large studies estimate that anywhere between 9 and 40% of refugee populations suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) brought on by the crisis that led to their refugee status. These studies also showed a significant proportion of crisis-affected populations (between 5 and 30%) experiencing depression. Though a few large studies have been conducted, research gaps exist in investigating chronic mental health impacts of humanitarian crises, which is why these estimates have so much variation. PTSD along with moderate to severe depression and anxiety can be life-long disorders without adequate and prompt treatment.

====Responses====
The WHO and the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) recommend that mental health care should be an integral part of emergency response during a humanitarian crisis. The type of mental health care provided can range and vary based on the context and resources but can include mental health first aid on the front lines, community support groups, and routine clinical mental health care. The WHO also recommends that countries enhance their mental healthcare systems outside of the context of a humanitarian crisis so that individuals affected by crises can have access to the care they need once the emergency response is over. A 2020 Cochrane review of psychological and social interventions for the prevention of mental disorders for individuals living in areas affected by humanitarian crisis found the need for better studies to determine the impact of interventions following a review of current studies. Research states that mental health is often neglected by first responders. Disaster can have lasting psychological impacts on those affected. When individuals are supported in processing their emotional experiences to the disaster this leads to increases in resilience, increases in the capacity to help others through crises, and increases in community engagement. When processing of emotional experiences is done in a collective manner, this leads to greater solidarity following disaster. As such, emotional experiences have an inherent adaptiveness within them, however the opportunity for these to be reflected on and processed is necessary for this growth to occur.

==Sustainable solutions==

There is no singular solution to any one humanitarian crisis. Often, the primary cause of a humanitarian crisis is intertwined with several other factors. Further, one repercussion can lead to another which may lead to another. For instance, in the case of a flood, fish and ocean life is impacted, an environmental and ecological impact. This can further impact humans the source of income for fishermen, an economical impact. This causes the residents of this particular area to be stripped from their source of food and their culture of consuming sea fish. This can lead to women and children being forced to work in dangerous conditions to gain income and food, a social impact. Evidently, one crisis can have many impacts that are interconnected with one another and there is no single solution. The Feinstein International Center at Tufts University works to understand and find solutions to the intersection of various factors that contribute to humanitarian crisis.

==Preparing for humanitarian crises==

Disaster preparedness is critical to building both national and international capacity to prevent, respond to, and recover from humanitarian emergencies. Disaster preparedness activities can be categorized into material preparedness (building to code, avoiding building in hazardous areas, strengthening homes, preparing emergency kits, etc.) and into behavioral preparedness (training, early warning, disaster insurance, etc.). The international community possesses five key to key entities for guidance programming, research, and funding for disaster preparedness capacity-building:

* United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction: The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction implements the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR). The UNISDR, led by the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary General for Disaster Risk Reduction, serves, “…as the focal point in the United Nations system for the coordination of disaster reduction and to ensure synergies among disaster reduction activities&quot;. A component of UNISDR work is implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030.
* International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies: The IFRC operates around the globe and across all phases of the humanitarian programme cycle, helping affected nations by working with member National Societies and the international community to prepare for, respond to, and recover from “…natural and man-made disasters in non-conflict situations.&quot;
* Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) : OCHA is a United Nations office, “…responsible for bringing together humanitarian actors to ensure a coherent response to emergencies.&quot; OCHA&#x27;s leader operates as both the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and as the Emergency Relief Coordinator, advocating for increased awareness of, preparedness for, and response to humanitarian emergencies worldwide. As the Emergency Relief Coordinator, the OCHA lead also chairs the Inter-Agency Standing Committee.
* Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC): The IASC provides a forum for both UN-affiliated and non-UN-affiliated organizations to coordinate action regarding humanitarian policies, advocacy, and response evaluation and improvement. In 2005, the IASC released its Transformative Agenda with 10 protocols to, “…improve the effectiveness of humanitarian response through greater predictability, accountability, responsibility and partnership&quot;. Protocol 8: “Common Framework for Preparedness” and Protocol 9: ”Emergency Response Preparedness” provide guidance countries and humanitarians can implement for risk assessment and preparedness planning. Additionally, IASC also oversees global humanitarian clusters as a part of the Cluster Approach.
* Global Clusters: To aid coordination during the humanitarian programme cycle, the UN established the Cluster Approach. Clusters are groups of humanitarian organizations with explicit responsibilities for coordinating action within each humanitarian sector. Preparedness is fundamental to the Cluster Approach, with leaders within each global cluster working to build international capacity by developing standards, setting policy, and sharing leading practices for their sector before a humanitarian emergency occurs.

In addition to these five disaster preparedness entities, there is a multiplicity of government donor agencies that fund disaster preparedness activities, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the United Kingdom&#x27;s Department for International Development (DFID), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), and others. Additionally, there are many philanthropies that support disaster preparedness, such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

== Humanitarian Crisis Management ==

=== NGOs and the management of human-made crises ===
Many actors are involved in the strategic management of humanitarian crises and emergencies. The United Nations (UN) serves as the primary international actor in humanitarian crisis oversight but has extended responsibilities and management roles to improve the efficiency of crisis responses. With the development of a cluster system, the UN&#x27;s official organs have incorporated international organizations (IOs), international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) into the coordination of crisis management.

By expanding the responsibility for humanitarian crises beyond the UN&#x27;s singular authority, the number of actors involved in the coordination of the system has simultaneously increased. Requiring further attention to efficient cooperation in-between actors. Specifically, human-made crises, which differ from natural disasters in their fundamental origin of imposing humanitarian threats, create distinct challenges to appropriate crisis responses because of the new essence of conflicts. Today, conflicts are more frequently domestically fought rather than across national borders. Such development of crises has changed the ways humans are affected by conflict and asks for new response strategies to meet the needs of the people at risk. Thus, the multiple actors involved in human-made humanitarian crises, are faced with a challenging environment to establish efficient management and cooperation over the situation.

INGOs and NGOs are part of the clustered system of responsible actors in the management of humanitarian crises. They share organizational characteristics of a detachment from state association and a position of objectivity but differ in their level of operation. INGOs operate internationally, and NGOs pertain to a domestic level of activity. Non-governmental organizations overall have a non-profit structure, which means that they are solely providing services for the good of the population at risk and in need of assistance, without expectations of return benefits. Which allows them to focus on solidarity efforts in serving human needs and protecting human rights. The organizations are thus dependent on volunteers&#x27; investment in the shared vision of the entity. Their work also includes preventive efforts of serving as experts to deliver knowledge on management practices to the other actors. Additionally, by centering their work around a shared vision of establishing long-term peace through coordinated strategies of reconciliation and conflict assistance, they seek to efficiently fulfill their role in the humanitarian crisis management cluster.

The 2017 humanitarian crisis in Myanmar is an example that recognizes the unique position NGOs have and the responsibilities they serve in the international community. The crisis was acknowledged internationally when the ethnic group of the Rohingya had suffered from violent discrimination and denial of human rights for an extensive period. The Myanmar government prevented aid from both the UN and neighboring countries to support the ongoing crisis. Instead, the Indonesian government established a strategic cluster of cooperation between local NGOs in Indonesia and Myanmar. The alliance received the name of The Indonesian Humanitarian Alliance (AKIM) and provided relief to the exposed Rohingya people by getting around the barriers put in place by the Myanmar government. Several international NGOs were also involved in Myanmar to deliver appropriate relief. Their assistance allowed limited contact with the national government in Myanmar yet reached beneficial agreements with other local authorities, as well as established communication and cooperation with local NGOs and UN actors. However, because of the large number of actors involved in the crisis, the organizations faced challenges in the coordination between actors to provide efficient and non-coinciding crisis management.

In addition to the coordination aspect and its significance in humanitarian crisis management provided by NGOs, there is another potential strategy highlighting efficient communication to implement sufficient responses. NGOs often have to work with a diverse set of actors which may present challenges to efficient cooperation if expectations and goals divide across partnerships. To overcome obstacles within diverse interactions, NGOs may utilize three strategic environments of operation to establish efficient communication between parties. First, the “internal workplace” considers the diverse environment closely working with the NGOs, consisting of the organization&#x27;s employees and volunteers from the crisis exposed area. Second, the “inter-organizational forum” addresses the communication line between the multiple NGOs assisting in the specific crisis, including the local authorities and the appropriate reporting to UN agencies. Last, “community relations” recognizes the multicultural dimension of the communication between NGO employees and the individuals at risk of the crisis. The communication and coordination between the various actors in humanitarian crises are essential components for ensuring security, limiting the conflict, and overall delivering efficient crisis management.

Besides the attention to efficient coordination of actors and the recognition of diverse environments of communication, NGOs can also adopt strategic thinking in their work with humanitarian crises. What identifies the approach of strategic thinking is an overarching awareness of the environment of the particular crisis and the context of the organization assisting. With a broader understanding of the needs of the people at risk, and what the organization wishes to accomplice with its work, there is a greater chance for a successful outcome for both parties. Strategic thinking, coordination of actors, and efficient communication in diverse environments are all potential strategies that NGOs can use on both international and local levels to address humanitarian crises. As each organization and crisis is different, there is no such thing as a perfect strategy to manage humanitarian crises across the board. Instead, it is suggested to use methods such as strategic thinking, coordination, and communication to develop a response that is suitable for the specific situation and allows for successful management of serving human needs and protecting human rights.

<text>Burao, also spelt Bur&#x27;o or Bur&#x27;ao (; , , ), is the capital of the Togdheer region and the second largest city in Somaliland. Burao was the site of the declaration of an independent Somaliland on 18 May 1991.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;burco&quot; describes open, elevated land which has soft/rich soil, with the Burao area being considered fertile.

==History==
The city originated as a well named Ceel-Gooni in the late 18th century used by nomads from the surrounding area. The town subsequently grew around the well. Due to the availability of water along the dry valley, Burao developed into a small inland market hub that linked the port of Berbera with the hinterland and offered trading facilities for the region&#x27;s nomadic population. The settlement was later on burned to the ground by British forces in 1900, with the modern settlement being re-established in 1910.

For much of the 19th century, Burao served as the capital of the Habr Yunis Sultanate. Sultan Nur Ahmed Aman, Sutan Awad Deria and Sultan Madar Hersi ruled from Burao at different periods of time.After leaving the Berbera coastlands and ascending the escarpments of the great inland plateau, the convoy followed the valley of the Tug Dayr as far as Burao, capital of a powerful but friendly Habr Gerhaji sultan.Explorer Frank Linsly James, a guest of Sultan Awad Deria during his visit to Somaliland in 1884, describes a performance he witnessed by Habr Yunis Horsemen at Burao&#x27;s Togdheer River.During our stay at Burao, the Sultan collected a great many of his people together, and twice entertained us with some well-executed and characteristic evolutions on horseback. On the first occasion some forty mounted men were collected in the Tug before our zariba; but this did not satisfy the Sultan, and he arranged a second &quot;fan- tasia&quot;, in which fully two hundred warriors were engaged. It was the best and most characteristic thing of the kind I had ever seen. A procession was first formed in the river&#x27;s bed, and on a given signal all dashed off, brandishing their spears and shields. Dressed in tobes of many colours, and sitting loosely on their gaily caparisoned horses, they engaged in mimic contest with spear and shield, reining their horses upon their haunches when at full gallop, and with wild shouts flinging their spears into the air. Each warrior carried a short-handled whip with a broad raw hide thong, and with it lashed his steed unmercifully. Some of the riders went through regular circus feats, leaping from their horses when at full gallop, picking up objects thrown on the ground, and then remount- ing. After this had continued for some time they would gallop close to our zariba, and reining up, shout &quot;Mort, mort&quot; (&quot;Welcome, welcome&quot;), to which we replied, &quot;Kul liban&quot; (&quot;Thanks&quot;).

===Dervish movement===

The Dervish movement was founded in Burao in 1899. In the end of late August of that year the Dervish leaders and their clan followers assembled at Burao, Mohammed Abdullah Hassan with his followers from the Dhulbahante, the various Habar Jeclo sub clans with their principle headman Haji Sudi, and Sultan Nur Ahmed Aman with his followers from the Habr Yunis clan, declared open hostility. The assembled Dervish and their clan allies sent the following stern letter to Captain Cordeauxe and James Hayes Sadler:

&quot;This is to inform you that you have done whatever you have desired, and oppressed our well-known religion without any cause. Further, to inform you that whatever people bring to you they are liars and slanderers. Further, to inform you that Mahomed, your Akil, came to ask from us the arms we therefore, send you this letter. Now choose for yourself; if you want war we accept it, if you want peace pay the fine.&quot; September 1, 1899.
===Burao tax revolt and RAF bombing===

The people of Burao clashed with the British in 1922 after a heavy tax was imposed upon them. They revolted in opposition to the tax and this caused them to riot and attack British government officials. In the ensuing disturbances a shootout between the British and Burao residents broke out; Captain Allan Gibb, a Dervish war veteran and district commissioner, was shot and killed. The British, fearing they could not contain the revolt, requested that Secretary of State for the Colonies Sir Winston Churchill send troops from Aden and bomber aircraft in order to bomb Burao and the livestock of the revolting clans to quell any further rebellion. The RAF planes arrived at Burao within two days and proceeded to bomb the town with incendiaries, effectively burning the entire settlement to the ground. 
Telegram from Sir Geoffrey Archer, Governor of British Somaliland to Sir Winston Churchill the Secretary of State for the Colonies:
I deeply regret to inform that during an affray at Burao yesterday between Rer Sugulleh and Akils of other tribes Captain Gibb was shot dead. Having called out Camel corps company to quell the disturbance, he went forward himself with his interperter, whereupon fire opened on him by some Rer segulleh riflemen and he was instantly killed..Miscreants then disappeared under the cover of darkness.
In order to meet the situation created by the Murder of Gibb, we require two aeroplanes for about fourteen days. I have arranged with resident, Aden, for these. And made formal application, which please confirm. It is proposed they fly via Perim, confining sea crossing to 12 miles. We propose to inflict fine of 2,500 camels on implicated sections, who are practically isolated and demand surrender of man who killed Gibbs. He is known. Fine to be doubled in failure to comply with latter conditions and aeroplanes to be used to bomb stock on grazing grounds.

Sir Winston Churchill reporting on the Burao incident in the House of Commons:

On 25th February the Governor of Somaliland telegraphed that an affray between tribesmen had taken place at Burao on the previous day, in the course of which Captain Allan Gibb, D.S.O., D.C.M., the District Commissioner at Burao, had been shot dead. Captain Gibb had advanced with his interpreter to quell the disturbance, when 1954 fire was opened upon him by some riflemen, and he was instantly killed. The murderers escaped under cover of falling darkness.
Captain Gibb was an officer of long and valued service in Somaliland, whose loss I deeply regret. From the information available, his murder does not appear to have been premeditated, but it inevitably had a disturbing effect upon the surrounding tribes, and immediate dispositions of troops became necessary in order to ensure the apprehension and punishment of those responsible for the murder. On 27th February the Governor telegraphed that, in order to meet the situation which had arisen, he required two aeroplanes for purposes of demonstration, and suggested that two aeroplanes from the Royal Air Force Detachment at Aden should fly over to Berber a from Aden. He also telegraphed that in certain circumstances it might become necessary to ask for reinforcements of troops to be sent to the Protectorate.

James Lawrence author of &quot;Imperial Rearguard: Wars of Empire&quot; writes

[Gibb]..was murdered by rioters during a protest against taxation at Burao. Governor Archer immediately called for aircraft which were at Burao within two days. The inhabitants of the native township were turned out of their houses, and the entire area was razed by a combination of bombing, machine-gun fire and burning.

After the RAF aircraft bombed Burao to the ground, the leaders of the rebellion acquiesced, agreeing to pay a fine for Gibb&#x27;s death, but they refused to identify and apprehend the accused individuals. Most of the men responsible for Gibb&#x27;s shooting evaded capture. In light of the failure to implement the taxation without provoking a violent response, the British abandoned the policy altogether.

===1945 Sheikh Bashir Rebellion===

The 1945 Sheikh Bashir Rebellion was a rebellion waged by tribesmen of the Habr Je&#x27;lo clan in the former British Somaliland protectorate against British authorities in July 1945 led by Sheikh Bashir, a Somali religious leader.

On 2 July, Sheikh Bashir collected 25 of his followers in the town of Wadamago and transported them on a lorry to the vicinity of Burao, where he distributed arms to half of his followers. On the evening of 3 July, the group entered Burao and opened fire on the police guard of the central prison in the city, which was filled with prisoners arrested for previous demonstrations. The group also attacked the house of the district commissioner of Burao District, Major Chambers, resulting in the death of Major Chamber&#x27;s police guard before escaping to Bur Dhab, a strategic mountain south-east of Burao, where Sheikh Bashir&#x27;s small unit occupied a fort and took up a defensive position in anticipation of a British counterattack.

The British campaign against Sheikh Bashir&#x27;s troops proved abortive after several defeats as his forces kept moving from place to place and avoiding any permanent location. No sooner had the expedition left the area, than the news traveled fast among the Somali nomads across the plain. The war had exposed the British administration to humiliation. The government came to a conclusion that another expedition against him would be useless; that they must build a railway, make roads and effectively occupy the whole of the protectorate, or else abandon the interior completely. The latter course was decided upon, and during the first months of 1945, the advance posts were withdrawn and the British administration confined to the coast town of Berbera.

Sheikh Bashir settled many disputes among the tribes in the vicinity, which kept them from raiding each other. He was generally thought to settle disputes through the use of Islamic Sharia and gathered around him a strong following.

The British administration recruited Indian and South African troops, led by police general James David, to fight against Sheikh Bashir and had intelligence plans to capture him alive. The British authorities mobilized a police force, and eventually on 7 July found Sheikh Bashir and his unit in defensive positions behind their fortifications in the mountains of Bur Dhab. After clashes Sheikh Bashir and his second-in-command, Alin Yusuf Ali, nicknamed Qaybdiid, were killed. A third rebel was wounded and was captured along with two other rebels. The rest fled the fortifications and dispersed. On the British side the police general leading the British troops as well as a number of Indian and South African troops perished in the clashes, and a policeman was injured.

After his death, Sheikh Bashir was widely hailed by locals as a martyr and was held in great reverence. His family took quick action to remove his body from the place of his death at Geela-eeg mountain, about 20 miles from Burao. A secondary school in Burao, called the Sheikh Bashir Secondary School, is named in his honour.

=== Post-colonial ===

The town became a district capital and a number of public buildings were subsequently established in the following years. Burao&#x27;s administrative importance declined after Hargeisa replaced Berbera as the capital of the British Somaliland protectorate in 1941, and Burao&#x27;s urban infrastructure remained underdeveloped. However, with the expansion of the region&#x27;s livestock trade in the 1950s the city once again began to grow. Serving as the most important regional market hub, where livestock from the Hawd region as well as the city&#x27;s south-western hinterlands was assembled and exported to Saudi Arabia, Burao grew rapidly and replaced Berbera as the second largest city of the Protectorate.

Burao&#x27;s rapid growth continued after independence in 1960. Burao regained its administrative importance as it was made the capital of the Togdheer region, which at the time encompassed today&#x27;s Togdheer, Sool and Sanaag regions. Burao was also during this time the third largest city of Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargeisa.

With the opening of a local branch of the Somali Commercial Bank, livestock traders gained access to credits and further expanded their business activities by investing their profits in the real estate market, further contributing to the development and growth of the city. Burao was reorganized and restructured massively during the 1970s, and with the migration of locals to the Gulf states, where the oil boom had opened up new job opportunities, Burao&#x27;s vibrant land market was stimulated further as their savings were often invested in real estate. The city&#x27;s growth was also caused by the development of its shoe industry and educational facilities.

=== Somaliland War of Independence ===

After Siad Barre took power in 1969, the Isaaq sub-clans felt more and more marginalized, as outsiders from the Darood clan dominated the political establishment of Burao. Most governors during Barre&#x27;s time in office came from the South and belonged to Darood clans. Violent incidents against the Isaaq civilian population increased in the 1980s, which led to Isaaqs supporting the rebellion of the Somali National Movement.

In May 1988, the Somali National Movement launched an offensive on the cities of Hargeisa and Burao, then the second and third largest cities of Somalia. The SNM captured Burao on 27 May within two hours, while the SNM entered Hargeisa on 29 May, overrunning most of the city apart from its airport by 1 June. During the offensive the Somali National Army committed gross human rights violations, including attacking the civilian population using heavy artillery and tanks. Almost immediately SNM fighters took over the military compound at Burao airport where the majority of Somali army soldiers were stationed, the military compound at Goon Ad () in the outskirts of the city, as well as two police stations (including the central police station of Burao), Burao prison and a variety of government offices in the city. The SNM executed a number of Somali military officers and officials. After capturing Burao&#x27;s central prison the SNM freed political prisoners (including schoolchildren). Somali troops subsequently retreated to their base in Goon Ad.

After Somali troops retreated to Goon Ad, in the late afternoon, off-duty soldiers regrouped and entered the center of the city. According to reports by Human Rights Watch&#x27;s Africa Watch, the soldiers, upon entering the city, went on a rampage on 27 and 28 May. This included &quot;dragging men out of their houses and shooting them at point blank range&quot; and summary killing of civilians, the report also noted that &quot;civilians of all ages who had gathered in the centre of town, or those standing outside their homes watching the events were killed on the spot. Among the victims were many students.&quot; There was also widespread looting by the soldiers, and some people were reportedly killed as a result.

Following the first two days of the conflict, angered by the extent to which Isaaqs welcomed the SNM incursion, and frustrated by their inability to contain the SNM advance, the military started attacking the civilian population without restraint &quot;as if it was the enemy&quot;. The military used &quot;heavy artillery and tanks, causing severe damage, both to civilians and to property. Bazookas, machine guns, hand grenades and other weapons of mass destruction were also directed against civilian targets in Hargeisa which had also been attacked as well as in Burao.&quot;

A United States Congressional General Accounting Office team reported the Somali government&#x27;s response to the SNM attack as follows:The Somali army reportedly responded to the SNM attacks in May 1988 with extreme force, inflicting heavy civilian casualties and damages to Hargeisa and Burao...The Somali military resorted to using artillery and aerial shelling in heavily populated urban centres in its effort to retake Burao and Hargeisa. A majority of the refugees we interviewed stated that their homes were destroyed by shelling despite the absence of SNM combatants from their neighbourhoods...The refugees told similar stories of bombings, strafings, and artillery shelling in both cities and, in Burao, the use of armored tanks. The majority saw their houses either damaged or destroyed by the shelling. Many reported seeing members of their families killed in the barrage...Refugee interviews conducted by Africa Watch described how the government separated the non-Isaaqs from the Isaaqs before the attack was initiated:As soon as the fighting broke out, the government used loudspeakers to sort the civilians out into Darood and Isaak. They would shout, &quot;Who is from Galkayo? Mogadishu? Las Anod? Garoe?&quot; [Non-Isaaq territory]. They appealed to the non-Isaaks to leave so they could burn the town and all those who remained behind. Most of the people from these towns left; the government provided them with transportation.

==== Aerial bombardment and destruction of Burao ====

Somali Air Force aircraft started intense aerial bombardment of Burao on Tuesday 31 May. Burao, then the third largest city in Somalia was &quot;razed to the ground&quot;, and most of its inhabitants fled the country to seek refuge in Ethiopia. Foreign aid workers who fled the fighting confirmed that Burao was &quot;emptied out&quot; as a result of the government&#x27;s campaign.

=== Declaration of Independence ===

In May 1991, an SNM Central Committee convened in Burao collectively agreed upon revoking its voluntary union with the Somali Democratic Republic. Representatives from the Isaaq clan were in collective support of secession which was reinforced by the support the clan elders of the non-Isaaq clans who were present at the Burco conference Following extensive consultations between SNM leadership figures and clan representatives, it was agreed that Northern Somalia (formerly State of Somaliland) would revoke its voluntary union with the rest of Somalia to form the &quot;Republic of Somaliland&quot;. The conference was concluded with formation of an interim administration whereby Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur was elected to govern for a period of two years.

==Demographics==

Burao&#x27;s population has grown rapidly since its establishment. In 1962, Somalia&#x27;s statistical service estimated Burao&#x27;s population to be 12,600. This rose to 20,000 in 1994, 180,211 in 2005, and 230,000 in 2015. As of 2023, Burao has a population of 750,000.

The main residents of Burao are the Habr Je&#x27;lo, Habr Yonis, Isamusa and the Arap, which are all subdivisions of the larger Isaaq Somali clan-family.

Burao is divided into four wards; Mohamed Ali, Farah Omar, Lihle and Sheikh Bashir. These wards are further divided into neighbourhoods.

==Economy==
 
The city&#x27;s economy is primarily based on the export of livestock, with Burao and the nearby town of Yiroowe being home to two of the largest livestock markets, known in Somali as &quot;seylado&quot; in the Horn of Africa, with as many as 10,000 heads of sheep and goats sold daily in the city. Burao&#x27;s livestock market is also the most important livestock market in Somaliland as well as Somalia.

The city&#x27;s central location serves as a hub that connects the nomadic interior of Somaliland and major cities like Erigavo, Aynaba and Las Anod to Somaliland&#x27;s capital Hargeisa and its main port in Berbera. The central location of Burao has contributed to its economic revival. Goods travelling to the south, central and eastern parts of Somaliland all depart from the city&#x27;s outskirts. Rural merchants also sell their produce on a daily basis, which attracts business. This along with the main livestock market of the city fuels Burao&#x27;s economy.

In 2007, Burao&#x27;s city authority (in conjunction with development organizations and local traders) opened the Burco Meat and Produce complex. One year in the making, the market has two main halls and can accommodate more than 2000 merchants.

==Geography and climate==

Burao&#x27;s landscape is semi-desert and fairly flat.

The Togdheer River runs through the town. It is often dry but subject to flooding. The river divides the city in half, and can be crossed via a newly built bridge in the city center.

Weather in Burao, much like other inland towns in Somaliland, is very warm to hot and dry year-round. The city has a hot arid climate (Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;) in common with most of Somalia, although Burao&#x27;s weather is moderated by altitude. The average daytime temperatures during the summer months of June and August can rise to , with a low of at night. The weather is cooler the rest of the year, averaging during the day and at nighttime. The city&#x27;s limited rainfall of usually comes with two peaks during April–May and October–November.

==Wildlife==

Due to the fertility and greenery of the region, wild animals come to the area either to breed or to graze on the grassland savannah. Prominent animals found locally include the kudu, wild boar, zebra, Somali wild ass, warthog, antelope, the Somali sheep, wild goat, camel, and many different types of birds. Due south of Burao is a grassland savannah, which attracts many types of fauna to the region, including lions and leopards.

==Transportation==

Burao has a working bus system. Air transportation needs are served by the Burao Airport, which offers flights via Daallo Airlines to Hargeisa and other cities in the Horn of Africa, as well as international locations such as Addis Ababa and San&#x27;aa. As of 2012, the airport&#x27;s facilities are undergoing major renovations, supervised by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

<text>In topology, a branch of mathematics, the suspension of a topological space &quot;X&quot; is intuitively obtained by stretching &quot;X&quot; into a cylinder and then collapsing both end faces to points. One views &quot;X&quot; as &quot;suspended&quot; between these end points. The suspension of &quot;X&quot; is denoted by SX or susp(&quot;X&quot;). 

There is a variation of the suspension for pointed space, which is called the reduced suspension and denoted by Σ&quot;X&quot;. The &quot;usual&quot; suspension &quot;SX&quot; is sometimes called the unreduced suspension, unbased suspension, or free suspension of &quot;X&quot;, to distinguish it from Σ&quot;X.&quot; 

== Free suspension ==
The (free) suspension formula_1 of a topological space formula_2 can be defined in several ways.

1. formula_1 is the quotient space formula_4 In other words, it can be constructed as follows:

* Construct the cylinder formula_5.
* Consider the entire set formula_6 as a single point (&quot;glue&quot; all its points together).
* Consider the entire set formula_7 as a single point (&quot;glue&quot; all its points together).

2. Another way to write this is:

formula_8

Where formula_9 are two points, and for each &quot;i&quot; in {0,1}, formula_10 is the projection to the point formula_11 (a function that maps everything to formula_11). That means, the suspension formula_1 is the result of constructing the cylinder formula_5, and then attaching it by its faces, formula_15 and formula_16, to the points formula_9 along the projections formula_18.

3. One can view formula_1 as two cones on &quot;X,&quot; glued together at their base.

4. formula_1 can also be defined as the join formula_21 where formula_22 is a discrete space with two points.

5. In Homotopy type theory, formula_1 be defined as a higher inductive type generated by

S: formula_1

N:formula_1

formula_26

=== Properties ===
In rough terms, &quot;S&quot; increases the dimension of a space by one: for example, it takes an &quot;n&quot;-sphere to an (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-sphere for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0.

Given a continuous map formula_27 there is a continuous map formula_28 defined by formula_29 where square brackets denote equivalence classes. This makes formula_30 into a functor from the category of topological spaces to itself.

==Reduced suspension==
If &quot;X&quot; is a pointed space with basepoint &quot;x&quot;0, there is a variation of the suspension which is sometimes more useful. The reduced suspension or based suspension Σ&quot;X&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is the quotient space:

:formula_31.

This is the equivalent to taking &quot;SX&quot; and collapsing the line (&quot;x&quot;0 × &quot;I&quot;) joining the two ends to a single point. The basepoint of the pointed space Σ&quot;X&quot; is taken to be the equivalence class of (&quot;x&quot;0, 0).

One can show that the reduced suspension of &quot;X&quot; is homeomorphic to the smash product of &quot;X&quot; with the unit circle &quot;S&quot;1.

:formula_32

For well-behaved spaces, such as CW complexes, the reduced suspension of &quot;X&quot; is homotopy equivalent to the unbased suspension.

=== Adjunction of reduced suspension and loop space functors ===
Σ gives rise to a functor from the category of pointed spaces to itself. An important property of this functor is that it is left adjoint to the functor formula_33 taking a pointed space formula_2 to its loop space formula_35. In other words, we have a natural isomorphism

:formula_36

where formula_2 and formula_38 are pointed spaces and formula_39 stands for continuous maps that preserve basepoints. This adjunction can be understood geometrically, as follows: formula_40 arises out of formula_2 if a pointed circle is attached to every non-basepoint of formula_2, and the basepoints of all these circles are identified and glued to the basepoint of formula_2. Now, to specify a pointed map from formula_40 to formula_38, we need to give pointed maps from each of these pointed circles to formula_38. This is to say we need to associate to each element of formula_2 a loop in formula_38 (an element of the loop space formula_49), and the trivial loop should be associated to the basepoint of formula_2: this is a pointed map from formula_2 to formula_49. (The continuity of all involved maps needs to be checked.) 

The adjunction is thus akin to currying, taking maps on cartesian products to their curried form, and is an example of Eckmann–Hilton duality. 

This adjunction is a special case of the adjunction explained in the article on smash products.

=== Applications ===
The reduced suspension can be used to construct a homomorphism of homotopy groups, to which the Freudenthal suspension theorem applies. In homotopy theory, the phenomena which are preserved under suspension, in a suitable sense, make up stable homotopy theory.

== Examples ==
Some examples of suspensions are:&quot;&quot;

* The suspension of an n-ball is homeomorphic to the (n+1)-ball.

==Desuspension==
Desuspension is an operation partially inverse to suspension.

==See also==
*Double suspension theorem
*Cone (topology)
*Join (topology)

<doc id="1251705" wikidata="Q257978" url="?curid=1251705" title="Statutory city (Czech Republic)">
<text>In the Czech Republic, a statutory city () is a municipal corporation that has been granted city status by Act of Parliament. It is more prestigious than the simple title &quot;&quot; (&quot;town&quot;), which can be awarded by the cabinet and chair of the Chamber of Deputies to a municipality which applies for it.

==Differences of statutory city==
Statutory city status is partially ceremonial; the mayor is called &#x27;, rather than the &#x27; of other municipalities. Statutory cities are allowed to subdivide into self-governing city boroughs (sg. &#x27;) or city parts (sg. &#x27;) with their own elected councils; such a statutory city has to issue a statute (&quot;&quot;) that delimits power to boroughs. However, only seven statutory cities have done so. Cities Brno, Plzeň, Ústí nad Labem and Pardubice are divided into city boroughs, and Liberec has only one city borough with rest of the city being administered directly. Brno is divided into city parts, and Opava has eight city parts with rest of the city being administered directly. Also the capital of Prague, while not being &quot;de jure&quot; statutory city, is subdivided into similar self-governing boroughs.

==History==
The model is derived from its common origin in Austria-Hungary. Until 1928, 11 cities in the Czech lands received the statutory city title: Prague, Liberec, Brno, Jihlava, Kroměříž, Olomouc, Uherské Hradiště, Znojmo, Opava, Frýdek, and Bielsko (which became a part of Poland in 1920). On 1 December 1928 their count was reduced to five (Prague, Liberec, Brno, Olomouc and Opava). In 1942 Plzeň became a statutory city.

Between 1949 and 1967, the institute of statutory cities was canceled by reform in self-government and the establishment of regions. Only Prague remained a &quot;de facto&quot; statutory city. After 1967, several cities received similar position as Prague (Brno, Plzeň, Ostrava and Ústí nad Labem), but the statutory city title was not used.

The concept was renewed after the fall of communism by the Act on Municipalities in 1990, which established 13 statutory cities in addition to Prague, the capital city which is still a &quot;de facto&quot; statutory city.

Unlike Austria, before districts of the Czech Republic were abolished only the three largest cities (Brno, Ostrava and Plzeň) constituted a district &quot;()&quot; on their own; the others were a part (though always a capital, except Havířov) of a district with smaller municipalities. As the prestige associated with statutory city status grew, 12 additional statutory cities were created by the Act on Municipalities in 2000 and its four later amendments.

There are only two statutory cities, Havířov and Třinec, that are not seats of their eponymous districts.

==List==
Since August 2018, there are 26 statutory cities (plus Prague), comprising all the Czech cities over 40 thousand inhabitants (and Třinec):

<text>Lake Rotoaira (sometimes written &quot;Lake Roto-aira&quot;) is a small lake to the south of Lake Taupō on the North Island Volcanic Plateau in New Zealand. It covers an area of 13 km2.

Lake Rotoaira is one of the few privately owned lakes in New Zealand being administered by the Lake Rotoaira Trust on behalf of its owners. An access permit must be held by those using the lake for fishing and similar activities.

The lake is located in a graben between the broad volcanic dome of Mount Tongariro to the south and the smaller volcanic peak of Pihanga to the northwest. It is naturally drained by the Poutu Stream into the Tongariro River.

The Tongariro Power Scheme utilises Rotoaira as a storage lake for the Tokaanu Power Station. Extensive engineering works were carried out between 1964 and 1971 diverting a number of streams (including Whanganui River) into Rotoaira via Lake Otamangakau and construction of a tunnel through Pihanga to the Tokaanu Power Station. The lake originally drained into the Poutu Stream but when the Poutu Dam was constructed the lake level was raised by about 50 cm. Motuopuhi Island was formerly a peninsula but became an island when the water level was raised by the Tongariro power scheme. Motuopihi was the hiding place of Te Rauparaha and where he composed the Ka Mate haka.

Opōtaka, a traditional site of Māori occupation, is situated on the northern shore of the lake. Of significance to iwi Ngāti Tūwharetoa and Ngāti Hikairo it was excavated during archaeological investigations on the Tongariro Power Scheme and was found to have been occupied in the 19th century. In 2022 Ngāti Hikairo received funding to restore Opōtaka.

In 2021 the Lake Rotoaira Forest Trust received funding from the government&#x27;s Jobs for Nature programme to remove invasive plants and animals from around the lake, particularly in the lake&#x27;s wetlands.

<doc id="1251730" wikidata="Q1439352" url="?curid=1251730" title="Pagan's Motorcycle Club">
<text>Pagan&#x27;s Motorcycle Club, or simply the Pagans, is an outlaw motorcycle club formed by Lou Dobkin in 1957 in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The club rapidly expanded and by 1959, the Pagans, originally clad in blue denim jackets and riding Triumphs, began to evolve along the lines of the stereotypical one percenter motorcycle club.

The Pagans are categorized as an outlaw motorcycle club by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). They are known to fight over territory with the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club (HAMC) and other motorcycle clubs. They are currently active in California, Arizona, Nevada, Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, South Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Washington State and Puerto Rico.

== History ==
The Pagans were established in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, by then-president Lou Dobkin, beginning in 1957 and officially organized in 1958. The club had an initial thirteen founding members. The Pagans started out wearing denim jackets with embroidered insignia instead of the more standard three-piece patches utilized by most outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMG), and riding both American and British motorcycles, Harley-Davidsons and Triumphs. In the 1960s they adopted a formal constitution and formed a governing structure, choosing a national president who was paid the same amount as the United States president, which worked out to a $100,000 salary per year and calling the gesture &quot;a show of class.&quot;

They were a fairly non-violent group until 1965. A swelling mass of new members put the Pagans on the path to evolve into an OMG. It was largely a semantic gesture made after they gathered at a motorcycle race in Maryland; the ensuing incident found them branded as &quot;The 1% of motorcyclists whom caused problems&quot; in local newspapers. The Pagans claim to have invented and adopted the 1%er patch, referencing the newspaper articles of the time. This 1%er patch was quickly adopted by most other OMGs.

The Pagans, which “have been tied to traditional organized crime, including La Cosa Nostra, in cities like Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and New York&quot;, quickly became dominant in the mid-Atlantic region. They were the only large OMG in that region as well as a large portion of the northeast United States. Their growth under the leadership of John &quot;Satan&quot; Marron, saw the Pagans grow to nearly 5,000 members in the early 1970s. Their &quot;Mother Club&quot; is never in a fixed location, but it has been generally located in the northeast. The Pagans&#x27; top echelon of leadership must always number 13 members. There are also chapter presidents, with the largest chapter at times located in the Philadelphia area.

Though primarily concentrated in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, the Pagans began expanding into Florida in the 1990s and west, with chapters beyond the Mississippi River. The Pagans have grown slowly through a natural cycle of attrition in the smaller OMGs, the practice of patching over other chapters or entire clubs. The practice of incorporating smaller OMGs was prevalent from the 1970s to the early 1990s.

== Insignia ==
The Pagans MC patch depicts the Norse fire-giant Surtr sitting on burning world, wielding a fire sword, plus the word &quot;Pagan&#x27;s&quot; , in red, white and blue. The image of Surtr was taken from an illustration by Jack Kirby in issue 97 of the comic book &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot;.

Though historically not wearing a bottom rocker, a patch denoting the location of where a one-percenter bike club is based, the Pagan Motorcycle club has since started wearing an &quot;East Coast&quot; insignia on their vests

Members wear blue denim vests called cuts or cutoffs with club patches, known as colors, on the front and back.

Members of the Pagans&#x27; &quot;mother club&quot; wear a distinctive black number &quot;13&quot; patch.

== Membership ==
Pagans have approximately 1,500+ members and more than 100 chapters and are active along the east coast of the United States and more recently the west coast, and Puerto Rico. Chapters are common in Florida, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington State, Oregon, Puerto Rico and Nevada. The Pagans have a mother club or ruling council which ultimately rules the club.

Members are required to adhere to a number of club bylaws, among which is a rule that dictates members must ride only Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Members are not permitted to quit or retire from the club, and can only leave if they are expelled. Reasons for expulsion include losing one&#x27;s motorcycle or any piece of club property or paraphernalia, including club &quot;colors&quot;.

For decades the Pagans Motorcycle Club had looked north to Canada for possible expansion. It also found the idea of supporting Hells Angels rivals beneficial, such as the Rock Machine Motorcycle Club; a Canadian-based international motorcycle club with chapters all over the world, it has fought several conflicts with the Hells Angels including the Quebec Biker War, the deadliest motorcycle conflict in history. In 2011, dozens of the Pagans traveled to the Canadian province of New Brunswick to meet with the Rock Machine. At the time New Brunswick had little outlaw motorcycle influence. The meeting was to consolidate a friendship and probe the province for expansion. However in 2018, Pagans member, Andrew &quot;Chef&quot; Glick revealed that the group had abandoned its plans at expansion north. He cited Canada&#x27;s anti-biker laws but also a large part of the reason was that Canadian Hells Angels are considered particularly violent members of the outlaw biker – or “one percenter” – community, Glick said in an interview. “In Canada and Australia, that’s where the heaviest (toughest) one per centers are,” Glick said. “Being a one per center in Canada, I would say is a little more dangerous than being a one per center in the U.S.&quot; New Jersey bikers are tough, but “not near as violent as what I’ve seen and read (about) in Montreal and Toronto.”

== Organization ==
The Pagans organization is headed by a board of directors known as the &quot;mother club&quot;, which consists of thirteen senior members who set club policy, administer internal discipline, oversee the opening of new chapters and appoint club presidents and vice presidents.

The club&#x27;s leadership has traditionally been based in Central Pennsylvania.

==Criminal activities==

Along with the Bandidos, the Hells Angels and the Outlaws, the Pagans are classified by various law enforcement agencies in the United States as one of the &quot;big four&quot; motorcycle gangs. The Pagans have traditionally been considered the smallest of the &quot;big four&quot;. The Pagans are also the only &quot;big four&quot; club which is based solely in the United States and has no presence internationally. The Department of Justice classifies the club as an &quot;outlaw motorcycle gang&quot; (OMG) and contends that Pagans members are involved in the distribution of drugs such as cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana and PCP, as well as violent crimes directed at rival gangs including arson, assault, bombing, extortion and murder.

The Pagans have been linked to La Cosa Nostra crime families in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New York and New Jersey. The club also utilizes puppet clubs, affiliated street gangs and female associates to carry out retail drug distribution. The Pagans have been involved in rivalries with various other motorcycle gangs, most notably a longrunning feud with the Hells Angels.

=== Florida ===

On March 5, 1974, seventeen-year-old Amy Billig disappeared near her home in Coconut Grove, Florida. Billig&#x27;s fate remained unknown for at least 24 years, until in 1998 Paul Branch, a former Pagans member, revealed in a deathbed confession that on the day of her disappearance she had been abducted, drugged, raped, and murdered. According to Branch, Billig&#x27;s body was dumped in the surrounding Everglades, though it has never been found. Billig&#x27;s case received national media attention, including features on &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;.

On 15 May 2021, the Pagans got in a bar room fight with locals at Stripes Bar &amp; Grill in Navarre, Florida. Two days later a Rich Urban Bikers (RUBS) motorcycle was set on fire in front of Stripes. The Santa Rosa County Sheriff&#x27;s Office has been conducting an investigation with at least five Pagans and locals arrested or wanted.

=== Maryland ===
Pagans national sergeant-at-arms Kirby &quot;Bear&quot; Keller was indicted by a federal grand jury in Maryland in 1976 accused of operating a five-state drug ring.

A Pagans MC leader, Jay Carl Wagner, 66, was arrested in Washington County, Maryland, by 60-plus officers from state, local and federal officials with a bomb disposal robot on May 9, 2007, and later charged with possession of a regulated firearm after conviction of a violent crime. Police and agents recovered seven handguns, two alleged explosive devices and 13 rifles. On March 5, 2008, Wagner pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. On August 8, 2008, U.S. District Chief Judge Benson E. Legg sentenced Wagner to 30 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release.

On 6 October 2009, the home of national president David &quot;Bart&quot; Barbeito in Myersville, Maryland was raided by police. He was arrested on firearms charges. In June, 2010 he pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges. He was sentenced to thirty months&#x27; confinement.

=== New Jersey ===
On July 17, 1994, at least eight members of the Pagans showed up at the annual charity picnic fund-raiser organized by Tri-County MC in Hackettstown. The Pagans were there to intimidate local motorcycle clubs into aligning with the Pagans so they would have a larger power base to prevent the Hells Angels from getting established in New Jersey. A fight started and escalated from fists to knives and guns. When it was over, Pagans Glenn Ritchie and Diego Vega had been shot dead; Pagan Ron Locke and Tri-County member William Johnson had gunshot wounds, and Tri-County member Hank Riger had his throat cut.

Pagans member Robert &quot;Hellboy&quot; Deronde was convicted of the April 24, 2018 beating of Hells Angels member Jeffrey Shank with a baseball bat at a gas station in Newark, and was sentenced to four years in prison in July 2019.

Pagans national president Keith &quot;Conan&quot; Richter was arrested February 26, 2021 after a police stop in East Windsor where a loaded pistol was found in a vehicle in which he was a passenger.

===New York ===
Two 15-year-old girls who ran away from home in Ogden, Pennsylvania on March 7, 1975 were allegedly picked up by Pagan members and taken to the gang&#x27;s clubhouse in Queens, where they were held captive and raped by 30 to 40 men for two days. Afterwards, the girls were allegedly relocated to a home in Selden and raped for a further three days. On March 11, 1975, the girls escaped after they were left unguarded and alerted police, who raided the Selden home and arrested six persons, including a woman, on narcotics and rape charges.

On February 23, 2002, 73 Pagans were arrested on Long Island, New York after appearing at an indoor motorcycle and tattoo expo called the Hellraiser Ball. The Pagans had shown up to the event to confront Hells Angels who were at the Ball. Dozens of Pagans rushed the doors of the event and were met with violence by the Hells Angels. Fighting ensued, ten people were wounded, and a Hells Angel shot and killed a Pagans member. Two weeks later, a Pagans-owned tattoo parlor located in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was firebombed.

In September 2010, nineteen members of the Pagans were arrested in Rocky Point, New York for allegedly conspiring to murder members of the Hells Angels. Charges also include assault, distribution of cocaine and oxycodone, conspiracy to commit extortion and weapons charges. Two federal ATF agents infiltrated the gang, providing key evidence. One agent eventually served as sergeant-at-arms, the second-highest position in the hierarchy. Gang members were heard plotting to murder members of the Hells Angels using homemade hand grenades.

As many as 70 members of the Pagan&#x27;s and Hells Angels took part in a brawl in the parking lot of the Pennysaver Amphitheater in Farmingville during a classic car show on October 13, 2016. Two people were taken to hospital to be treated for injuries after the bikers were dispersed by police.

=== Pennsylvania ===
Member of the Pagan&#x27;s Motorcycle Club Anthony &quot;Rocky&quot; LaRocca was the nephew to former Pittsburgh mafia boss John LaRocca and acted as a liaison between the Pagans MC and the LaRocca crime family. In 1973, LaRocca and another member of the Pagans were charged with assaulting an ATF agent, conspiracy, firearms and possession of a silencer. In 1990, LaRocca and Francis &quot;Rick&quot; Ferri were sentenced to life in prison for the murder of John Heatherington. While incarcerated, LaRocca continued to control his cocaine distribution network through his family contacts in organized crime and members of the motorcycle club until he was indicted again and given an additional 20 years.

On March 24, 1974, two Pagan bikers, Michael Watson and George Coons, and a bystander, Thomas Connelly, were injured in a gunfight between Pagans and members of the Breed during the Philadelphia Custom Car, Speed and Cycle Show at the Philadelphia Civic Center.

In 1982, the Pagans attacked members of the Wheels of Soul in Philadelphia in an effort to cease the Wheels of Souls&#x27; expansion.

In January 1985, then national vice president of the Pagans Daniel &quot;Danny the Deacon&quot; Zwibel was indicted on RICO charges alongside co-defendants James Burke and Eugene (Nick the Blade) Gesuale who was the infamous “Pittsburgh connection” in the movie Goodfellas.

On March 21, 1985, 42 members and associates of the Pagans and the Iron Coffins, an Erie-based gang, were indicted on drug sales charges. The arrests came after a three-year investigation into the distribution of LSD, PCP, and amphetamines.

On Wednesday, December 9, 2020, a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh indicted 30 members and associates of the Pagans Motorcycle Club with narcotics trafficking and firearm possession. The seizure was of 12 firearms, &quot;significant quantities&quot; of drugs and $28,000 in cash and jewelry. Those charged include: Bill Rana, Eric Armes, Jason Evans, Hasani James, Cody Bonanno, Phillip Bonanno, Dominic Quarture, Mark Stockhausen, Patrick Rizzo, Anthony Peluso, Marissa Botta, David Pietropaolo, Thomas Snelsire, Wayne Webber, Ronald Simak, Anthony Scatena, James Stewart, Dorin Duncan, Jeffrey Kushik, Gary Hairston, Darian Wofford, Stephanie Zilka, Misty Walker, Richard White, Randy Camacho, Damian Cherepko, Brandon Hulboy, James Crivella, Seaira Collins and Jessica Taranto. As part of the investigation the FBI agents tapped 10 phones.

In 2005, Pagans allegedly opened fire on and killed the vice-president of the Hells Angels&#x27; Philadelphia chapter as he was driving his truck on the Schuylkill Expressway. Later that year, the Hells Angels closed their Philadelphia chapter.

On April 8, 2022, Pagans associate Jason Evans was sentenced to 57 months for his role in a large-scale operation trafficking drugs in western Pennsylvania and Ohio, federal prosecutors announced. Prosecutors said Evans was a close associate of a &quot;fully patched&quot; Pagans Motorcycle Club member of the Pittsburgh chapter and served as an &quot;enforcer.&quot;

On June 7, 2021, the vice president of a chapter in Pittsburgh, Patrick Rizzo, pleaded guilty before United States District Judge Robert J. Colville to illegal firearms possession.

=== Rhode Island ===
In 2018, 49 people, some members of the Pagans MC, were arrested in the largest bust in Rhode Island history. The seizure of 53 illegal guns, including a rocket launcher, and a &quot;large quantity&quot; of marijuana, crack, cocaine, and heroin was the end results of 12-month investigation conducted by members of the Rhode Island State Police Special Investigations Unit with assistance from the Rhode Island Attorney General&#x27;s office, ATF, and FBI.

=== West Virginia ===
The Pagan&#x27;s have chapters in Charleston and Fairmont, and are affiliated with the Barbarians, a local motorcycle gang.

===Multi-state===
In 2009, 55 Pagans members and associates were arrested from West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Florida. Charges range from attempted murder and kidnapping to drug dealing and conspiracy. So far, seven defendants in the case have pleaded guilty.

<text>Jan Kucharzewski (; 27 May 1876 in Wysokie Mazowieckie – 4 July 1952) was a Polish historian, lawyer, and politician. He was the prime minister of Poland from 1917 to 1918.

In 1898 he graduated from Warsaw University. He was a member of the &quot;Zet&quot; political organization, the National Democrats (Narodowa Demokracja) movement, and the National League (Liga Narodowa) until 1911. In the first years of World War I he resided in Switzerland, where he wrote articles for the Polish cause. In June 1917 he came back to Warsaw and received a job in the administration under the Regency Council. From 26 November 1917 to 27 February 1918 he was the Minister President of the Polish government. He resigned, along with the rest of his government after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed. 

After 1920 he dedicated his life to scholarly and legal work. He was named to the International Court of Arbitration in 1925. In 1940 (World War II) he went into exile in the US, where he published many works for the Polish cause, mainly from an anti-communist and anti-Soviet point of view.

<text>David Allan Tilson (born March 19, 1941) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2002, and served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Dufferin—Caledon from 2004 to 2019 as a member of the Conservative Party. When he left office, he was the oldest serving MP in the 42nd Parliament.

==Background==
Tilson was educated at the University of New Brunswick and Queen&#x27;s University, and began practicing law in Orangeville, Ontario in 1970. He served as a trustee on the Dufferin County Board of Education for two terms, and then as a municipal councillor in Orangeville for six years. In the latter capacity, he was the founding Chair of Orangeville&#x27;s Blue Box program and a Director of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. He also served on the board of Westminster United Church.

==Ontario politics==
Tilson was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1990, defeating incumbent Liberal Mavis Wilson in Dufferin—Peel by 572 votes. The New Democratic Party won this election, and Tilson spent the next five years as an opposition member.

The Ontario Tories won a majority government in the provincial election of 1995, and Tilson greatly increased his margin of victory, defeating Wilson by almost 15,000 votes in a rematch. He was appointed chair of the government caucus in November 1997.

Tilson won another landslide re-election victory for the new riding of Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey in the 1999 election. On April 2, 2002, he resigned his seat in the legislature to allow Premier Ernie Eves (who had been elected party leader without holding a seat) to run as a parachute candidate in a by-election. In 2003–04, he served as vice-chair of the Ontario Municipal Board.

==Federal politics==
Tilson ran for the House of Commons of Canada in the federal election of 2004 and defeated incumbent Liberal Murray Calder by a margin of 43% to 39% in the new riding of Dufferin—Caledon.

Tilson supported plans to cut farm support programs, including the AgriRecovery Program, by $2 billion over the next year.

Tilson did not run for reelection in the 2019 federal election.

<text>The Indianapolis 500 auto race has used a [[Safety car|pace car]] every year since 1911. The pace car is utilized for two primary purposes. At the start of the race, the pace car leads the assembled starting grid around the track for a predetermined number of unscored warm-up laps. Then if the officials deem appropriate, it releases the field at a purposeful speed to start the race. In addition, during yellow flag caution periods, the pace car enters the track and picks up the leader, bunching the field up at a reduced speed.

Prior to the first &quot;500&quot; in 1911, in the interest of safety, Indianapolis Motor Speedway founder Carl G. Fisher is commonly credited with the concept of a &quot;rolling start&quot; led by a pace car. Nearly all races at the time, as well as all Formula One races even to the present, utilize a standing start.

In almost every year since 1936, it has been a tradition that the winner of the Indianapolis 500 be presented with one of that year&#x27;s pace cars (or a replica). In most years since 1911, the driver of the pace car at the start of the race has been an invited celebrity, a former racing driver, or notable figure in the automotive industry. Historically, the honor of supplying the pace car was, and continues to be, a coveted honor by the respective automobile manufacturers and a marketing showcase for the particular make/model.

==Pace lap formats==

===1911–1956===

The pace car was used to take the starting field on one unscored lap. The field would use the lap to warm up their engines, tires, and then at the conclusion of the lap, at a prescribed speed, the pace car would pull off the track and allow for a rolling or &quot;flying&quot; start. Fisher himself drove the pace car in several early years, but it eventually became an honorary position, with invitations extended to former winners, notable figures in auto racing or the automobile industry. The invited driver was given the honor of &quot;pacemaker,&quot; and manufacturers used the honor of providing the car as marketing exposure.

During his tenure as Speedway president, Tony Hulman rode in the pace car nearly every year, immediately after giving the command to start engines. His primary duty was to marshal the start and in some years, his responsibilities included operating a film camera that would be housed inside the car&#x27;s trunk.

Dating back to the very early years, the pace cars were often painted with special liveries complete with logos, lettering, pinstriping, and other decorative markings. In addition, sometimes flagpoles, lights, and other motoring paraphernalia were installed to further identify the pace car. Most manufacturers used the opportunity to showcase their higher end or luxury models. Since in the early years, the pace car was only used for one lap at the start (and not during caution periods), the need for a high performance machine (i.e., sports car) was not necessarily the top priority. In many years, the pace car was a convertible, which along with increasing the luxury status of the vehicle, it aided in the officials&#x27; ability to marshal the start.

===1957–1976===

In most years through the early 1950s, the pace car led the field around the track for one warm up lap, and then the race began. The pace lap concept was popular with fans, as many drivers commonly waved at the fans and the rolling grid made for spectacular photographs. By 1957, the procedure was changed so the pace car led the field for two warm up laps. This allowed extra time to warm up the engines, oil temperatures, and tires, and allowed the drivers the chance to survey the conditions of the entire track at least once before receiving the green flag. This also allowed the fans on the main stretch (where the largest grandstands are located) to see the entire field parade by one time before the start. Previously only fans on other parts of the track got to actually see the grid go by for photographs and waving.

For the 1957–1958 races, the grid was lined up and exited single-file from the newly constructed pit lane. The two laps allowed the field to properly form up, however, in practice it turned out to be difficult and both races saw incidents at the start. In 1959, the field went back to lining up the grid on the main stretch, and continues to do so to this day.

By the late 1960s, not only would a special driver be behind the wheel of the pace car, but numerous celebrities would be invited to ride along as passengers. Automotive executives, NASA astronauts, reporters from ABC Sports and the IMS Radio Network, and other celebrities were among those invited to ride in the pace car.

In 1971, local Indianapolis Dodge dealer Eldon Palmer was involved in a crash driving the pace car. He crashed into a photographer&#x27;s stand at the south end of the pit area, injuring several persons. In the years immediately following, the pace car driver utilized would only be an experienced race driver. Former Indy winner Jim Rathmann served six times (and once for caution periods only). Celebrities James Garner and Marty Robbins were chosen in part due to their experience in racing.

===1977–present===

In 1977, the format was changed to three warm up laps - two &quot;parade laps&quot; and one &quot;pace lap&quot;. During the parade lap(s), often several replica festival pace cars join the field, usually carrying celebrities and/or special guest drivers. The 1978 race was the first to feature multiple pace cars on the track during the parade lap. Since 2010, the IndyCar &quot;two-seater&quot; (a retired Indy race car modified with a special passenger seat) has also been at the front of the field, carrying a celebrity or special guest. The non-participating vehicles pull off the track after one or two circuits, and the lone official pace car leads the field on the pace lap. In 2012, it was further expanded to four warm up laps (three &quot;parade&quot; laps and one &quot;pace&quot; lap), coinciding with the introduction of a new engine and chassis formula.

Starting in about 1994, the field was observed to be quite straggled about during the parade lap(s), and often circulated the track single-file. Drivers were known to weave back and forth, sometimes vigorously, in an effort to build up tire temperature. On the final pace lap, the field would finally form up into the eleven rows of three on the backstretch, but oftentimes it was still loose and not in pristine order. This practice was often the subject of harsh criticism from fans and media, especially when the start was strung out single file, breaking tradition. In 2010, officials announced they were going to police the parade and pace laps closer, requiring the drivers to stay in the rows of three during the extent of the warm up period.

In later years, the Speedway began experimenting with using pop culture celebrities driving the pace cars, a change that has met with mixed responses from fans. Racers have taken the position in more recent years. A. J. Foyt drove in 2011, Dario Franchitti drove in 2014, Jeff Gordon, a five-time Big Machine Vodka 400 winner, drove in 2015, and with the new broadcast partner NBC Sports, their motorsport broadcaster Dale Earnhardt Jr., who made 16 Big Machine Vodka 400 starts and a two-time Indiana 250 winning car owner at the Speedway, drove in 2019.

===Extra pace laps===

1957: A new state-of-the-art pit lane was built. For the first time, the pit area was separated from the racing surface. For 1957–1958, the field was lined up in single file on the pit lane, rather than the traditional 11 rows of three on the race surface. This required the cars to pull away, then assemble into formation. This caused tremendous confusion in 1958, as the front row escaped from the pace car, and the field needed an extra pace lap to assemble before the green was displayed.

1967: The race was red-flagged for rain after 18 laps. The conclusion of the race was moved to the following day. At the time, the pace car was not used for caution periods. However, officials decided to utilize the pace car for the resumption on lap 19. The original pace car driver Mauri Rose drove the car for the restart as well. Two unscored laps (one parade lap and one pace lap) preceded the resumption at lap 19.

1970: Jim Malloy hit the outside wall in turn four as the field was about the take the green flag. The start was waved off, and the next time by, the field was red flagged to clean up the incident. The teams were allowed to replenish a few gallons of used up fuel, and a short time later, the field pulled away for two new pace laps.

1973: A crash occurred as the field was about to take the green flag. The start was red flagged, and the cars circulated around back to the pits. After clean up, the field restarted, with two pace laps before the green flag.

1986: Tom Sneva crashed on the backstretch on the pace lap. The start was waved off, and the next time around the cars were halted on the frontstretch with a red flag. During the cleanup, officials decided to replenish the teams&#x27; fuel tanks with 3 gallons of methanol. After that was completed, the field restarted, and took two warm up laps before the green flag.

1992: Additional pace laps were run (unscored) after Roberto Guerrero crashed during a parade lap. Instead of halting the proceedings, officials decided to simply extend the number of warm up laps. The race itself ended up having 85 laps of yellow flag conditions, therefore the fuel allotment did not become a factor.

1997: Additional laps were run (unscored) due to a three-car crash on the original pace lap.

2009: When the field came out of turn four for the start, the field was not well aligned in the eleven rows of three. For the first time in modern history, the flagman decided to wave off the start, by displaying the yellow flag. The lap was not scored. The field re-formed, and received the green flag the next time by, with a slightly better formation.

==Caution periods==
Through 1978, the pace car was only used at the start of the race, and was not used during caution periods. Since 1979, the pace car has also been used to pack up the field during caution flag periods. The ceremonial driver drove only at the start of the race. During caution periods, when the pace car is utilized to pace the field, a trained official has been the driver. In some cases, the officials utilize two separate pace cars (exactly the same models) one each for the start of the race, and the caution periods. Currently, the pace car driver for the caution periods is the same driver who drives the pace car for the IndyCar Series during all other events.

==Cars==


Starting in the mid-1950s, the auto manufacturer who provided the official pace car started selling replica pace cars to the general public. In many cases, the official on-track pace car was modified from its street-legal counterpart. Strobe lights, roll bars, multi-point harnesses, television camera mounts, two-way communication (for officials), and removing the air conditioning, are among some of the more routine modifications made for the actual pace car. Some official pace cars, however, have undergone extensive performance modifications, including suspension, transmission, or even engine modifications from their production counterpart (the 1990 Chevrolet Beretta is an example of this). Race-duty pace cars may also have the factory fuel tank replaced with a fuel cell, and usually have an on-board fire extinguisher installed. The special edition production replicas available to the public usually come with full paint and &quot;Indy 500&quot; decals, and may be part of a performance package upgrade.

In addition, the track typically is provided with dozens of lower-end (&quot;base model&quot;) pace car production replicas (or different makes by the same manufacturer) for use as festival cars throughout the month. Examples of this practice date back to the mid-1920s. The company who provides the pace car also often provides safety trucks for use at the track. For instance, in 1994, the Ford Mustang Cobra was chosen as the primary pace car. Ford Motor Company provided numerous Mustang GTs (a &quot;stripped-down&quot; model) for festival use. In 1996, the Dodge Viper GTS was chosen as the pace car. Rather than providing a fleet of Vipers, Chrysler provided numerous Stratus, Intrepids, and Special Edition Rams for festival use.

The replica pace cars and the festival cars are usually worth significantly less than the actual car used to perform the pace car duties. Few festival cars may actually have been driven on the track. Actual pace cars are rare and most are kept and owned by the Speedway museum and the manufacturers.

Traditionally, the make of the pace car has always been a domestic American brand. In 1991, the Dodge Stealth was originally named the pace car. However, the UAW, along with traditionalists, protested since the Stealth was a captive import built by Mitsubishi in Japan. Shortly before the race, the Stealth was downgraded to be the festival car. The pre-production Dodge Viper RT/10 was substituted on race day.

In 2001 and 2003, trucks were used instead of pace cars. In 2005, a specially restored 1955 Bel Air pace car was commissioned by the Indianapolis Race Committee to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Chevrolet V-8 engine. Only one car was built and it was displayed and used on the speedway. It differed from the first 1955 track cars in that it was black. The original 1955 Chevrolet pace cars were red and cream two-tone. This car is currently on display at the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Museum in Auburn, Indiana.

Since 2002, Chevrolet has had an exclusive contract with the Speedway to provide the pace car and other official vehicles for the Indianapolis 500. Prior to that, series engine provider Oldsmobile (1997-2001) had a similar arrangement, and provided the pace car three times over a five-year period. Chevrolet has had a contract to provide the pace car for the Brickyard 400 since 1994.

Since 1936, the winner of the race has traditionally been awarded a pace car. In some years, and in most cases for the past several decades, the winner is actually presented with one of the official street-legal pace car replicas.

==Pace cars and drivers==

===Pacemakers (1911–1941)===




===Pacemakers (1946–1978)===
*Note: From 1958 to 1963, retired driver Sam Hanks was named &quot;Director of Racing&quot; for USAC, and assumed the pace car duties. No &quot;celebrity&quot; drivers were used during that period.
*Note: The car assignments for the 1975 Indianapolis &quot;500&quot; Mile Race had the VIN number for pace car #1 as 4H57H5-H125041 and VIN number for pace car #2 as 4H57H5-H125135. The VIN engine code identifies as a 350 c.i.d (5.7 litre) V8 and was actually the modified 455 c.i.d. (7.5 litre) V8. Additionally, each VIN number for the total of the 55 Buick Century coupe Pace car replicas.

===Pace cars (1979–2025)===
*1998: Professional golfer Greg Norman was originally selected to drive the pace car in 1998. He participated in testing runs in the early spring. However, Parnelli Jones was named a last-minute substitute after Norman was forced to withdraw because of shoulder surgery.
*2001 &amp; 2003: Pace truck or SUV
*2006: This was before doping scandals erased his sporting records in 2011. (See Lance Armstrong doping case.)
*2008: There were two Chevrolet Corvette pace cars for the 2008 race; a metallic green pace car that runs on E85 driven by Fittipaldi at the start, and a pace car painted to resemble the 1978 pace car that runs on gasoline (used during caution periods)
*2011: Donald Trump was initially named the driver, but resigned the honor due to speculation about his candidacy in the 2012 presidential race as well as the negative fan reactions against his selection, including a Facebook campaign.

===Two-seater===
Starting in 2010, a modified Dallara IR03, converted to a two-seater, has also led the field during the parade and pace lap. Billed as the &quot;Fastest Seat in Sports,&quot; it is driven by a former Indy driver, and carries a special passenger. This is featured at many IndyCar Series races.

== Multiple appearances ==

=== By driver (for start of the race, not caution periods only) ===
=== By car ===
The process of varying the selection across different models, which existed from 1911 through 2001, has been abandoned since 2002, with all pace cars exclusively provided by the Chevrolet marque since that year.

=== By manufacturer ===
A list of manufacturers and the frequency in which they either provided official pace cars, or one of their vehicles were selected to pace the Indianapolis 500. This list counts all subsidiary marques, current and defunct, from each manufacturer along with vehicles made by a company that later merged with another on the list.

The process of varying the selection across different manufacturers, which existed from 1911 through 1996, has been abandoned since 1997, with all pace cars exclusively provided by General Motors since that year.

<doc id="1251758" wikidata="Q1054143" url="?curid=1251758" title="Ōoka Tadasuke">
<text>was a Japanese samurai in the service of the Tokugawa shogunate. During the reign of Tokugawa Yoshimune, as a magistrate () of Edo, his roles included chief of police, judge and jury, and Yamada Magistrate () prior to his tenure as South Magistrate (Minami Machi-bugyō) of Edo. With the title Echizen no Kami (Governor of Echizen or Lord of the Echizen), he is often known as . He was highly respected as an incorruptible judge. In addition, he established the first fire brigade made up of commoners, and the Koishikawa Yojosho (a city hospital). Later, he advanced to the position of , and subsequently became of the Nishi-Ōhira Domain.

Ōoka was born in 1677, but did not come into public notice until he was 35, when he was appointed an obscure judgeship. When he accepted this job, he found out that there was a long-standing boundary dispute between the farmers of the Yamada and Wakayama (Kishū) fiefs, which is also known as the &quot;Case of the Inherited Rice Fields.&quot; While it was obvious that the Yamada claim was the just one, no previous judge had been foolish enough to irritate Yoshimune, Lord of Kishū, as he was very close to the shōgun, Tokugawa Ietsugu. However, Ōoka took up the case, and immediately settled it on its merits. 

According to the story, the dispute began in the early 18th century when the lord of the Wakayama domain granted some rice fields to a group of farmers in the Yamada region. However, the grant was ambiguous, and there was confusion over the exact boundaries of the fields and who had the right to use them. The dispute continued for several generations, and the farmers of both regions became embroiled in bitter arguments and legal battles.

When Ōoka Tadasuke was appointed as the magistrate of the region, he was tasked with resolving the dispute once and for all. After carefully studying the case and listening to the arguments of both sides, Ōoka came up with a unique solution that satisfied everyone.

He ordered the farmers of both Yamada and Wakayama to plant their rice fields with red beans instead of rice. He then declared that whichever side produced a better harvest of red beans would be declared the rightful owners of the disputed rice fields.

The farmers of Yamada were known for their skills in growing rice and were initially confident that they would win the competition. However, the farmers of Wakayama had secretly been growing red beans for generations and had perfected their cultivation techniques. As a result, they were able to produce a much larger and healthier crop of red beans than the farmers of Yamada.

When the final harvest was taken, Ōoka Tadasuke declared that the farmers of Wakayama had proven their superior farming skills and deserved to be the rightful owners of the disputed rice fields. The decision was accepted by both sides, and the long-standing dispute was finally resolved.

Yoshimune was so impressed that when he became shōgun five years later, he took the unusual action of promoting Ōoka over hundreds of other candidates, to the important post of machi-bugyō (magistrate) of Edo (old name for Tokyo). The post of machi-bugyō combined the duties of mayor, police chief, judge, and fire marshal.

The city of Chigasaki in Kanagawa Prefecture has a festival for Ōoka in late April.

== Famous cases ==
In addition, the figure has taken on a legendary status in a number of stories about his unorthodox and wise legal decisions, frequently used in rakugo (Japanese storytelling).

One of the most famous stories is called &quot;The Case of the Stolen Smell&quot;: A poor student would eat a simple meal while the innkeeper was cooking, because the fumes of the innkeeper&#x27;s food would make the student&#x27;s meal more enjoyable. The paranoid innkeeper considered this stealing and demanded compensation but when the student refused, he took the matter to court. Although his colleagues advised Ōoka to throw the case out as ridiculous, he decided to hear it. The judge resolved the matter by ordering the student to pass the money he had in one hand to his other, and ruling that the price of the smell of food is the sound of money.
In &quot;The Case of the Bound Jizō or Suspect Statue&quot;, Ōoka was called upon to discover the thief of a cartload of cloth from a local kimono maker. Ōoka ordered a statue of Jizō of the Narihira-san Tōsen-ji, a temple in Tokyo, to be bound and brought forth to be called to answer for dereliction of its custodial duty. When the bound statue arrived in the courtroom, the spectators burst into laughter. Ōoka sternly ordered each spectator to be punished with a token fine for their outburst: a small swatch of cloth. When the spectators paid their fines, the robbed kimono maker identified the piece of cloth from one spectator as identical to the cloth stolen in the crime. The spectator, who was the actual thief, was arrested, and Ōoka ordered the Jizō statue released as having discharged his duty. In 1925, the statue was removed from downtown Tokyo to a little temple called Nanjo-in on its outskirts. The statue still stands, and is wrapped in rope tied by hopeful victims of thieves. However, the statue is worn almost smooth because of over 200 years of binding.

== Ōoka in fiction ==
Ōoka Tadasuke has been the central character in two &quot;jidaigeki&quot; television series. In one, &quot;Ōoka Echizen,&quot; actor Gō Katō played the lead. In the other, &quot;Meibugyō! Ōoka Echizen&quot;, Kinya Kitaōji played the same role.

In addition, series such as &quot;Abarenbō Shōgun&quot; have portrayed Ōoka as an intimate of the shōgun Tokugawa Yoshimune. Ōoka was portrayed first by Tadashi Yokouchi and later by Ryo Tamura.

Other actors who portrayed Ōoka include Ichikawa Danjūrō XII in &quot;Honō no Bugyō Ōoka Echizen no Kami&quot; (Tokyo Broadcasting System, 1996) and Sakae Takita in the 1995 Taiga drama &quot;Hachidai Shogun Yoshimune&quot;.

He has been mentioned in the manga by Rumiko Takahashi, &quot;Ranma ½&quot;.

In 1984 Czechoslovakian sino- and japanologist Věnceslava Hrdličková has published book &quot;Stories of Judge Ōoka&quot;. In 1988 this book was adapted by Brno studio of Czechoslovak Television into 62 minute TV fairytale called Rozsudky soudce Ooky (Judgements of Ōoka the Judge). Ōoka was portrayed by Miroslav Donutil.

Dutch author Bertus Aafjes wrote a five-book series of mystery novels featuring Ōoka.

Ōoka as well as one of his famous cases was portrayed in both the manga and anime adaptations of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War.

Ōoka is a major character in the Japanese tokusatsu series, &quot;Shiro Jishi Kamen&quot; (&quot;White Lion Mask&quot;).

===English presentations===
Stories of Ōoka began showing up in English in 1908, in &quot;The Case of Ten-Ichi-Bo, a Cause Celebre in Japan&quot; by W. J. S. Shand, published by the Tokyo Methodist Publishing House.

In 1956, an illustrated book was created by I.G. Edmonds, an American military officer. Published by the Pacific &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot;, it was called &quot;Solomon in Kimono: Tales of Ooka, a Wise Judge of Old Yedo&quot;. Edmonds&#x27; work was published in 1961 as &quot;Ooka the Wise&quot;, and then in 1966 renamed &quot;The Case of the Marble Monster and Other Stories&quot; and made widely available to American schoolchildren by the Scholastic publishing company.

Beginning in 1999, Judge Ōoka has appeared in the &quot;Samurai Detective&quot; series by Dorothy and Thomas Hoobler. Books include &quot;The Ghost in the Tokaido Inn&quot; (1999), &quot;The Demon in the Teahouse&quot; (2001), &quot;In Darkness, Death&quot; (2004; Edgar Award winner), &quot;The Sword That Cut the Burning Grass&quot; (2005), &quot;A Samurai Never Fears Death&quot; (2007), and &quot;Seven Paths To Death&quot; (2008)

<text>In electronics and signal processing, full scale represents the maximum amplitude a system can represent.

In digital systems, a signal is said to be at digital full scale when its magnitude has reached the maximum representable value. Once a signal has reached digital full scale, all headroom has been utilized, and any further increase in amplitude will result in an error known as clipping. The amplitude of a digital signal can be represented in percent; full scale; or decibels, full scale (dBFS).

In analog systems, full scale may be defined by the maximum voltage available, or the maximum deflection (full scale deflection or FSD) or indication of an analog instrument such as a moving coil meter or galvanometer.

==Binary representation==
Since binary integer representation range is asymmetrical, full scale is defined using the maximum positive value that can be represented. For example, 16-bit PCM audio is centered on the value 0, and can contain values from −32,768 to +32,767. A signal is at full-scale if it reaches from −32,767 to +32,767. (This means that −32,768, the lowest possible value, slightly &quot;exceeds&quot; full-scale.)

Signal processing in digital audio workstations often uses floating-point arithmetic, which can include values past full-scale, to avoid clipping in intermediate processing stages. In a floating-point representation, a full-scale signal is typically defined to reach from −1.0 to +1.0.

==Processing==
The signal passes through an anti-aliasing, resampling, or reconstruction filter, which may increase peak amplitude slightly due to ringing. 

It is possible for the &quot;analog&quot; signal &quot;represented by&quot; the digital data to exceed digital full scale even if the digital data does not, and vice versa. Converting to the analog domain, there is no clipping problem as long as the analog circuitry in the digital-to-analog converter is well designed.

If a full-scale analog signal is converted to digital with sufficient sampling frequency, and then reconstructed, the Nyquist theorem guarantees that there will be no problem in the analog domain due to &quot;peak&quot; issues because the restored analog signal will be an exact copy of the original analog signal. (However, if the signal is normalized in the digital domain, it may contain &quot;intersample peaks&quot; which exceed full scale after analog reconstruction.)

<text>The Indianapolis 500 (also called the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race) is an annual American open-wheel car race held on American Memorial Day weekend at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS), in Speedway, Indiana. It was first held in 1911 after the track&#x27;s owners had experimented with several other long-distances auto races over the previous two years. The race was not held in 1917 or 1918 and again from 1942 to 1945 because of war. It was administered by the American Automobile Association between 1911 and 1955, then by the United States Auto Club from 1956 to 1997, and finally by the Indy Racing League/IndyCar beginning in 1998. The event usually covers 200 laps over a total distance of . Each winning racer and team is presented with a small replica of the Art Deco sterling silver Borg-Warner Trophy, a replica of the pace car, a large sum of money, and a championship ring as prizes for winning the race. In the 108 editions of the Indianapolis 500 that have occurred as of the 2023 event, 75 different drivers have won. 

A. J. Foyt, Al Unser, Rick Mears, and Hélio Castroneves share the record for the most victories with four each. Troy Ruttman and Unser are the youngest and oldest Indianapolis 500 winners, winning at the ages of 22 years and 80 days in 1952 and 47 years and 360 days in 1987, respectively. Juan Pablo Montoya holds the record for the longest period of time between two victories – 15 years between the 2000 and 2015 races. Castroneves holds the record for the longest span of wins. He won his first Indianapolis 500 in 2001 and his last (as of 2024) in 2021, a span of 20 years. It has been won by drivers from 11 different countries. A total of 55 American drivers have won 77 editions of the race, more than any other nationality. The winner of the first race was American racer Ray Harroun in 1911, and the most recent winner is American racer Josef Newgarden in 2024. Two editions of the Indianapolis 500, in 1924 and 1941, were won by two drivers sharing a car; relief drivers were used in the winning entries in 1911, 1912, 1923, and 1925, but they are not recognized as race winners. Team Penske has won the most races as a car entrant with 20 since their first in 1972.

<doc id="1251777" wikidata="Q2402805" url="?curid=1251777" title="Thermal desorption spectroscopy">
<text>Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) is the method of observing desorbed molecules from a surface when the surface temperature is increased. When experiments are performed using well-defined surfaces of single-crystalline samples in a continuously pumped ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber, then this experimental technique is often also referred to as thermal desorption spectroscopy or thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS).

==Desorption==
When molecules or atoms come in contact with a surface, they adsorb onto it, minimizing their energy by forming a bond with the surface. The binding energy varies with the combination of the adsorbate and surface. If the surface is heated, at one point, the energy transferred to the adsorbed species will cause it to desorb. The temperature at which this happens is known as the desorption temperature. Thus TPD shows information on the binding energy.

==Measurement==
Since TPD observes the mass of desorbed molecules, it shows what molecules are adsorbed on the surface. Moreover, TPD recognizes the different adsorption conditions of the same molecule from the differences between the desorption temperatures of molecules desorbing different sites at the surface, e.g. terraces vs. steps. TPD also obtains the amounts of adsorbed molecules on the surface from the intensity of the peaks of the TPD spectrum, and the total amount of adsorbed species is shown by the integral of the spectrum.

To measure TPD, one needs a mass spectrometer, such as a quadrupole mass spectrometer or a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer, under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. The amount of adsorbed molecules is measured by increasing the temperature at a heating rate of typically 2 K/s to 10 K/s. Several masses may be simultaneously measured by the mass spectrometer, and the intensity of each mass as a function of temperature is obtained as a TDS spectrum.

The heating procedure is often controlled by the PID control algorithm, with the controller being either a computer or specialised equipment such as a Eurotherm.

Other methods of measuring desorption are Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) or using infrared detectors, thermal conductivity detectors etc.

==Quantitative interpretation of TPD data==


TDS spectrum 1 and 2 are typical examples of a TPD measurement. Both are examples of NO desorbing from a single crystal in high vacuum. The crystal was mounted on a titanium filament and heated with current. The desorbing NO was measured using a mass spectrometer monitoring the atomic mass of 30.

Before 1990 analysis of a TPD spectrum was usually done using a so-called simplified method; the &quot;Redhead&quot; method, assuming the exponential prefactor and the desorption energy to be independent of the surface coverage. After 1990 and with use of computer algorithms TDS spectra were analyzed using the &quot;complete analysis method&quot; or the &quot;leading edge method&quot;. These methods assume the exponential prefactor and the desorption energy to be dependent of the surface coverage. Several available methods of analyzing TDS are described and compared in an article by A.M. de JONG and J.W. NIEMANTSVERDRIET. During parameter optimization/estimation, using the integral has been found to create a more well behaved objective function than the differential.

== Theoretical Introduction ==
Thermal desorption is described by the Polanyi–Wigner equation derived from the Arrhenius equation.

:formula_1
where 
:formula_2 the desorption rate [mol/(cm2 s)] as a function of formula_3,
:formula_4 order of desorption,
:formula_3 surface coverage,
:formula_6 pre-exponential factor [Hz] as a function of formula_3,
:formula_8 activation energy of desorption [kJ/mol] as a function of formula_3,
:formula_10 gas constant [J/(K mol)],
:formula_11 temperature [K].

This equation is difficult in practice while several variables are a function of the coverage and influence each other. The “complete analysis method” calculates the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy at several coverages. This calculation can be simplified. First we assume the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy to be independent of the coverage.

We also assume a linear heating rate:

(equation 1)
:formula_12
where:
:formula_13 the heating rate in [K/s],
:formula_14 the start temperature in [K],
:formula_15 the time in [s].

We assume that the pump rate of the system is indefinitely large, thus no gasses will absorb during the desorption. The change in pressure during desorption is described as:

(equation 2) 
:formula_16

where:
:formula_17 the pressure in the system,
:formula_18 the time in [s].
:formula_19,
:formula_20 the sample surface [m2],
:formula_21 a constant,
:formula_22 volume of the system [m3],
:formula_23 the desorption rate [mol/(cm2 s)],
:formula_24,
:formula_25 the pump rate,
:formula_22 volume of the system [m3],

We assume that formula_27 is indefinitely large so molecules do not re-adsorp during desorption process and we assume that formula_28 is indefinitely small compared to formula_29 and thus:

(equation 3)
:formula_30

Equation 2 and 3 lead to conclude that the desorption rate is a function of the change in pressure. One can use data in an experiment, which are a function of the pressure like the intensity of a mass spectrometer, to determine the desorption rate.

Since we assumed the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy to be independent of the coverage.
Thermal desorption is described with a simplified Arrhenius equation:

(equation 4)
:formula_31
where: 
:formula_23 the desorption rate[mol/(cm2 s)],
:formula_4 order of desorption,
:formula_34 surface coverage,
:formula_35 pre-exponential factor [Hz],
:formula_36 activation energy of desorption [kJ/mol],
:formula_10 gas constant,
:formula_11 temperature [K].

Using the before mentioned Redhead method (a method less precise as the &quot;complete analysis&quot; or the &quot;leading edge&quot; method) and the temperature maximum formula_39 one can determine the activation energy:

(equation 5)
for n=1 
:formula_40

(equation 6)
for n=2
:formula_41 

M. Ehasi and K. Christmann described a simple method to determine the activation energy of the second order.
Equation 6 can be changed into:

(equation 6a)
:formula_42
where:
formula_43 is the surface area of a TDS or TPD peak.

A graph of formula_44 versus formula_45 results in a straight line with a slope equal to formula_46.
Thus in a first-order reaction the formula_39 is independent of the surface coverage. Changing the surface coverage one can determine formula_48. Usually a fixed value of the pre-exponential factor is used and is formula_49 known, with these values one can derive the formula_50 iteratively from formula_39.

<text>Owen Thomas Edgar (June 17, 1831 – September 3, 1929) was, according to data from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the longest surviving U.S. veteran of the Mexican–American War.

==Biography==
He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He enlisted in the United States Navy as a 2nd-class apprentice on February 10, 1846, and was discharged as an Apprentice First Class on August 8, 1849. Edgar saw service on the frigates &quot;Potomac&quot;, &quot;Allegheny&quot;, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; and &quot;Experience&quot;.

After the war, he worked at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing for twenty-one years, then worked at a bank for another thirty-one years. He spent his final ten years living at the John Dickson Home in Washington, D.C.

He became the last surviving American veteran of the Mexican-American War on June 17, 1929 when fellow war veteran William Buckner died at the age of 101 in Paris, Missouri.

==Death and interment==
Edgar died September 3, 1929, at the age of 98 after suffering a fall from a chair that fractured his leg, and was buried in Washington&#x27;s Congressional Cemetery.

<text>The Regency Council of the Kingdom of Poland () was a semi-independent and temporarily appointed highest authority (head of state) in partitioned Poland during World War I. It was formed by Imperial Germany and Austria-Hungary within historically Polish lands in September 1917 after dissolution of the previous authority – Provisional Council of State (January – August 1917), due to the oath crisis.

The council was supposed to stay in office until the appointment of a new monarch or regent. On 7 October 1918, the Regency Council declared the independence of Poland. That same month, the council took over the command of the &quot;Polska Siła Zbrojna&quot; armed forces.

==History==
The members of the Regency Council included: Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski, archbishop of Warsaw; Prince Zdzisław Lubomirski, president (mayor) of Warsaw; and landowner Józef Ostrowski, conservative politician, former chairman of the Polish Club in the Duma in St. Petersburg.

Together with the State Council and other branches of the government, the Regency Council exercised limited administrative powers, mainly in education and justice. In spite of this, Council made some crucial decisions, like creation of &quot;Dziennik Ustaw -&quot; most important Polish publication of legal acts, still functioning.

On 7 October 1918, the council declared the independence of Poland from Germany and Austria-Hungary. On 11 November, it transferred its military authority, and on 14 November the rest of its authority, to Józef Piłsudski, which led to dissolution of council the same day. Piłsudski served from 22 November as temporary chief of state of the newly independent Polish state

<doc id="1251799" wikidata="Q1589826" url="?curid=1251799" title="Hauptwohnsitz">
<text>In German-speaking countries, Hauptwohnsitz () denotes the primary place of residence. In Germany and Austria, the concept of Hauptwohnsitz has special legal ramifications, primarily involving tax.

In Austria the Hauptwohnsitz has an important meaning in the context of financial adjustment between the federation and the local municipalities. On the basis of the census determined number of inhabitants with Hauptwohnsitz, the municipality receives its budget from the federal government. Hauptwohnsitze count themselves for a municipality in two regards: By the direct payment per head, and an increase in premiums after exceeding certain thresholds for the number of inhabitants. This leads to frequent censuses to match the budget of a municipality to its number of inhabitants. In fact, many municipalities are negatively affected by this system. The city of Graz, Austria&#x27;s second largest city, counts about 300,000 registered Hauptwohnsitze, however, almost 340,000 people do have their main residence there, as there are many students still having their Hauptwohnsitz registered in their hometowns. Since those are not taken into account concerning fiscal distribution, Graz faces serious economic problems. Currently there are campaigns trying to motivate students having their Hauptwohnsitz registered there.

The Hauptwohnsitz in Germany is based on the main center of ones&#x27; interest (&quot;Lebensmittelpunkt&quot;). The Hauptwohnsitz is also the place in which one exercises the right to vote, and where the municipal administration issues a citizen&#x27;s ID card and passport. The income tax revenue is split between the federal government, the Land government and the municipality where the respective taxpayer has their &quot;Hauptwohnsitz&quot;. Apart from the &quot;Hauptwohnsitz&quot; a person can establish multiple secondary places of residence (&quot;Nebenwohnsitze&quot;, sg. &quot;Nebenwohnsitz&quot;) where they are also registered as residents but do not have a right to vote. A number of German municipalities impose a secondary-residence tax (&quot;Zweitwohnungssteuer&quot;) on persons having such a secondary residence, the rationale for that being that they have to provide services to these persons but do not share in their income tax.

On the other hand, the cost of a secondary residence (including the secondary-residence tax) for employment purposes is tax decuctible.

<doc id="1251800" wikidata="Q6679040" url="?curid=1251800" title="Lord Chaos (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Lord Chaos is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Jim Starlin, the character first appeared in &quot;Marvel Two-In-One&quot; Annual #2 ( 1977). Lord Chaos is an abstract entity. It is the cosmic counterpart of Master Order and serves as the embodiment of chaos.

==Publication history==

The character debuted in &quot;Marvel Two-In-One&quot; Annual #2 (1977), created by Jim Starlin. It appeared in the 2016 &quot;Ultimates 2&quot; series.

==Fictional character biography==
Lord Chaos is an abstract entity who embodies disarray and confusion, and the opposing force to &quot;brother&quot; entity Master Order. The pair are rarely seen, but appear to manipulate events to prompt Spider-Man to solicit the Thing to join the Avengers and Adam Warlock in the first war against the Titan Thanos and defeat him. 

Lord Chaos and Master Order were then seen observing King of the Norse Gods Odin and master villain Dormammu play a cosmic game of chess. They next conspired with other metaphysical and &quot;omnipotent&quot; beings against the Beyonder. They were then summoned by the Silver Surfer to regain control over their servant the In-Betweener. Lord Chaos and Master Order imprisoned the In-Betweener for his transgressions. 

They also attend the funeral of Eon and speak with cosmic hero Quasar.

Lord Chaos and Master Order participated in the congress of metaphysical and abstract beings to determine Thanos&#x27; fitness to wield the Infinity Gauntlet. They chose to join Adam Warlock and the other cosmic deities in a bid to stop Thanos. With the other abstract beings, they battled Thanos, and then battled Nebula when she obtained the Gauntlet from Thanos. The congress of abstract beings then witnessed Adam Warlock&#x27;s cosmic trial to determine his worthiness to wield the Infinity Gauntlet. Lord Chaos and Master Order were next seen among a group of abstract beings questioning the Beyonder from the Dimension of Manifestations.

In &quot;Infinity Crusade&quot; it is learned that they must obey the dictates of Eternity and Infinity.

In &quot;Time Runs Out&quot;, the Beyonders kill Chaos, Order, the In-Betweener, and other abstract entities in each reality across the multiverse.

Following the restoration of the universe in &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, Chaos and Order become disgruntled by Galactus&#x27; evolution from a force of destruction to a force of creation. They kill the Living Tribunal and force the In-Betweener to fuse them into Logos, a new being who can take his place. However, they are separated by Black Panther&#x27;s astral form.

==Powers and abilities==
Lord Chaos is an abstract being who embodies the metaphysical concept of Chaos. It has no physical form, although on occasion it has manifested as a disembodied human head. It has the ability to control and manipulate time, reality, and space. 

Thanos wielding the Infinity Gauntlet ranked Lord Chaos&#x27; scale of power as above that of Galactus, but below Eternity. Lord Chaos and Master Order were able to easily kill the Living Tribunal by blasting him with energy, and also defeat Galactus after transforming into Logos.

==Other versions==
Lord Chaos and Master Order battle Thanos in an alternate universe when he possesses the Heart of the Universe.

<doc id="1251811" wikidata="Q3586303" url="?curid=1251811" title="1997 Alberta general election">
<text>The 1997 Alberta general election was held on March 11, 1997, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.

The Progressive Conservative government led by Premier Ralph Klein won its eighth consecutive mandate going back to 1971, increasing its share of votes and seats in the Legislature relative to the previous election in 1993. The Liberal Party retained Official Opposition status, though it lost nearly half its seats. After an electoral wipeout in 1993, the NDP returned to the Legislature by winning two seats.

==Background==
The Progressive Conservative Association had governed Alberta since 1971, and premier Ralph Klein led the party into his second general election as party leader. The previous election in 1993 was the best result for the Liberal Party since its last electoral victory in 1917.

This was the second consecutive election fought on a new set of electoral boundaries, due to an Alberta Court of Appeal decision that was critical of the map created in 1992. The government amended the Electoral Boundaries Commission Act, introducing the present system where the commission is made up of a justice from the Court, two members appointed by the governing party, and two members appointed by the official opposition. A new Commission was created, which issued its recommendations for a new set of electoral boundaries in 1996.

==Opinion polls==
== Results ==
Ralph Klein&#x27;s second election as leader of the PCs was considerably more successful than his first. The party won over half the popular vote, and 63 of the 83 seats in the legislature for its eighth consecutive term in government. The party continued to dominate in Calgary and rural areas, and managed to regain a foothold in Edmonton where it won two seats.

The Liberal Party of Grant Mitchell lost about 7% of the popular vote it had won in the 1993 election. The party&#x27;s legislative caucus was reduced from 32 members to 18.

Pam Barrett led the New Democratic Party back into the legislature with two seats (both in Edmonton), despite winning an even smaller share of the popular vote than in 1993.

The Social Credit Party also re-emerged, placing a strong second in several rural ridings, but did not win any seats.

Overall voter turnout was 53.75%.

Notes:

* Party did not nominate candidates in the previous election.

x – less than 0.005% of the popular vote

<text>South Western Sydney is a region of the city of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is situated in the south-west of the larger Sydney metropolitan area, and is part of the predominantly working class area of Greater Western Sydney. Geographically, the region lies in the Cumberland Plain.

==Local government areas==
There are a number of different boundaries and definitions for Sydney&#x27;s South-West with majority of definitions including the suburbs within City of Liverpool as well as surrounding areas. 

This can also include the Macarthur region which is often referred to as &#x27;Outer South-West&#x27;, particularly referring to the local government area of City of Campbelltown as well as Camden Council and occasionally also the Wollondilly Shire. 

In the broadest sense, South-Western Sydney can also include Fairfield City Council as it is south of Prospect Reservoir even though geographically the council is west of Sydney CBD and not south-west.

== Institutions ==
Several institutions have &#x27;South Western Sydney&#x27; in their title, including: 
* South Western Sydney Local Health District 
* South Western Sydney Institute 
* South Western Sydney Clinical School

== See also ==
* Southern Sydney
* St George Area
* Greater Western Sydney

<text>Hoo St Werburgh, commonly known as Hoo, is a large village and civil parish in the Medway district of Kent, England. It is one of several villages on the Hoo Peninsula to bear the name &quot;Hoo&quot;, a Saxon word believed to mean &quot;spur of land&quot; or to refer to the &quot;distinct heel-shape of the ridge of hills&quot; through the settlement. Hoo features in Domesday Book, and had a population of 7,356 at the 2001 census, rising to 8,945 at the 2011 census. The civil parish includes Chattenden to the west.

== History ==
St Werburgh was the daughter of King Wulfhere of Mercia, and niece of King Æthelred, his brother and successor. She was born between 640 and 650.
The first church of Hoo may have been built in the reign of the 8th-century King Æthelbald of Mercia, though presumably a monastery existed nearby at an earlier time. This, together with land at Hoo All Hallows, is likely to have been placed under the rule of the leading Mercian monastery of Medeshamstede, now known as Peterborough.

A significant, and possibly unique, feature of this ancient parish church are the two Royal hatchments of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I. These were later restored and can be viewed in the church. The Reverend Ferdinando Booth of the same family as Archbishop Lawrence Booth was vicar here from 1675 to 1680.
The parish records of 1851 gave the population as 1,065. According to official census figures, the population was, in 1891, 1,400; in 1971, 7,725; and in 1981, 7,944.

&quot;Broad Street&quot; appeared as &quot;Brodestrete&quot; in 1478. &quot;Jacobs Lane&quot; is named after the family of Stephen Jacobe of Hoo (1480). A workhouse was in use here until the 1930s, and the secondary school bears the name &quot;The Hundred of Hoo Academy&quot;.

Hoo was connected to the Chattenden and Upnor Railway by a -long branch which closed in the 1890s.

Although historically and mostly referred to as Hoo, in 1955 the Parish Council, during a revision of the Ordnance Survey map of the area, requested that Hoo should be shown as &#x27;Hoo St Werburgh&#x27;. The Parish Council formally submitted an application in February 1968, under Section 147(4) of the Local Government Act 1933, for the name of the civil parish to be changed to &#x27;Hoo St Werburgh&#x27;. In response, the County Council presented a change of name document which ordered and declared that with effect from the first day of October 1968, and until further order, the name of the civil parish shall be Hoo St Werburgh.

== Village amenities ==
Hoo Village Hall &amp; Jubilee Hall are located on Pottery Road Recreation Ground. Hoo Village Hall &amp; Jubilee Hall are run as a charitable trust by a management committee.

Hoo has one 1.5-acre allotment site (made up of 35 plots) located off Everest Drive. The allotments site is managed by the Parish Council.

Formerly a primary school, Hoo has a library located next to St Werburgh Church on Church Street. The library is managed by Medway Council.

Hoo has one public convenience (toilets, including disabled toilet) and carpark located on Stoke Road. The public convenience and carpark is managed by Medway Council.

Hoo has a 1.0-acre green and landscaped gardens located in the centre. The village green and gardens are managed by Medway Council. The gardens are also looked after and tended to by a group of volunteer residents.

Hoo has a pond and surrounding nature reserve located off Hemony Grove. The pond and reserve is managed by a private maintenance company, although the site is open to the public for recreation. Public liaison is Medway Council.

=== Recreation grounds ===
Hoo has three recreation grounds managed by the Parish Council.

Kingshill Recreation Ground, located off Fourwents Road, is a 7.71-acre site which includes a play park, surfaced football and basketball pitch, woodland walks and open space surrounded by treeline.

Pottery Road Recreation Ground, located off Pottery Road, is a 5.32-acre site which includes an older children&#x27;s play park and separate younger children&#x27;s play park, enclosed surfaced football and basketball pitch, skate half pipe, skate ramps, adult exercise equipment, sheltered seating area and open space surrounded by treeline.

Hoo Common, located off Elm Avenue, is a large site which includes woodland walks, meadows and open space surrounded by treeline.

=== Transport ===
Arriva Southern Counties operates bus route 191 to Chatham every 20 minutes, with one service every hour continuing in the opposite direction to Isle of Grain.

==Future development==
As part of the developing Local Plan, Medway Council has proposed to expand and develop Hoo into a &quot;small rural town&quot;. The expansion could be supported by a new railway station.

== Education ==
Hoo is served by a number of schools. 
Hoo St Werburgh Primary School is for pupils aged 4–11 years of age. There are a total of 386 pupils arranged into 14 classes with two classes per year group. Attached to the school is the Marlborough Centre which caters for children diagnosed as autistic. The centre has 54 children arranged into six classes.

The Hundred of Hoo Academy (formerly The Hundred of Hoo School) is for pupils aged 4–18 years of age. There are a total of 1,757 pupils. The academy holds specialist Arts College status and is named after the &quot;hundred of Hoo&quot; featured in Domesday Book. The academy offers advanced media facilities and provides secondary education as well as one form entry primary education. Pupils draw from the various villages on the Hoo Peninsula.

==Governance==

Hoo is within the Rochester &amp; Strood parliament constituency.

=== Local government ===
Hoo is governed by two tiers of local government:
*Medway Council is a Unitary Authority, responsible for the majority of council services, combining the typical functions of a county council and a district council.
*Hoo Parish Council is a Parish Council, responsible for a small number of local council services.

== Notable residents ==

Thomas Aveling, a pioneering agricultural engineer, was born in Elm, Cambridgeshire on 11 September 1824 before moving to Hoo. He was the co-founder of Aveling and Porter which became the largest manufacturer of steam rollers in the world. Aveling died on 7 March 1882 and is buried in the churchyard at St Werburgh Church. There is a road in Hoo called Aveling Close, named after Aveling.

William Lionel Wyllie, a prolific maritime painter, was born in Camden Town, London on 5 July 1851. He once lived at Hoo Lodge, located on top of a ridge, which would have provided inspiration with its panoramic view of the River Medway and the maritime activity at Chatham Dockyard. The corvette HMS Calypso (1883) was built at Chatham, which Wyllie painted in 1897. Wyllie died on 6 April 1931 at Primrose Hill, London. There is a road in Hoo called Wylie Road (incorrectly spelled), named after Wyllie.

Declan Galbraith, best known for his 2002 hit single &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, which peaked at #29 in the UK Singles Chart, is from Hoo.

Pauline Parker, known for the 1954 Parker–Hulme murder case in Christchurch, New Zealand, now lives in Hoo following her release after serving a 5-year prison sentence. She currently runs a children&#x27;s riding school in the area.

<doc id="1251821" wikidata="Q420011" url="?curid=1251821" title="Plant embryonic development">
<text>Plant embryonic development, also plant embryogenesis, is a process that occurs after the fertilization of an ovule to produce a fully developed plant embryo. This is a pertinent stage in the plant life cycle that is followed by dormancy and germination. The zygote produced after fertilization must undergo various cellular divisions and differentiations to become a mature embryo. An end stage embryo has five major components including the shoot apical meristem, hypocotyl, root meristem, root cap, and cotyledons. Unlike the embryonic development in animals, and specifically in humans, plant embryonic development results in an immature form of the plant, lacking most structures like leaves, stems, and reproductive structures. However, both plants and animals including humans, pass through a phylotypic stage that evolved independently and that causes a developmental constraint limiting morphological diversification.

== Morphogenic events ==
Embryogenesis occurs naturally as a result of single, or double fertilization, of the ovule, giving rise to two distinct structures: the plant embryo and the endosperm which go on to develop into a seed. The zygote goes through various cellular differentiations and divisions in order to produce a mature embryo. These morphogenic events form the basic cellular pattern for the development of the shoot-root body and the primary tissue layers; it also programs the regions of meristematic tissue formation. The following morphogenic events are only particular to eudicots, and not monocots.

=== Plant ===
Following fertilization, the zygote and endosperm are present within the ovule, as seen in stage I of the illustration on this page. Then the zygote undergoes an asymmetric transverse cell division that gives rise to two cells - a small apical cell resting above a large basal cell.
These two cells are very different, and give rise to different structures, establishing polarity in the embryo.
;apical cell:The small apical cell is on the top and contains most of the cytoplasm, the aqueous substance found within cells, from the original zygote. It gives rise to the hypocotyl, shoot apical meristem, and cotyledons.
;basal cell:The large basal cell is on the bottom and consists of a large vacuole and gives rise to the hypophysis and the suspensor.

=== Eight cell stage ===
After two rounds of longitudinal division and one round of transverse division, an eight-celled embryo is the result. Stage II, in the illustration above, indicates what the embryo looks like during the eight cell stage. According to Laux et al., there are four distinct domains during the eight cell stage. The first two domains contribute to the embryo proper. The &quot;apical embryo domain&quot;, gives rise to the shoot apical meristem and cotyledons. The second domain, the &quot;central embryo domain&quot;, gives rise to the hypocotyl, root apical meristem, and parts of the cotyledons. The third domain, the &quot;basal embryo domain,&quot; contains the hypophysis. The hypophysis will later give rise to the radicle and the root cap. The last domain, the &quot;suspensor&quot;, is the region at the very bottom, which connects the embryo to the endosperm for nutritional purposes.

=== Sixteen cell stage ===
Additional cell divisions occur, which leads to the sixteen cell stage. The four domains are still present, but they are more defined with the presence of more cells. The important aspect of this stage is the introduction of the protoderm, which is meristematic tissue that will give rise to the epidermis. The protoderm is the outermost layer of cells in the embryo proper.

=== Globular stage ===
The name of this stage is indicative of the embryo&#x27;s appearance at this point in embryogenesis; it is spherical or globular. Stage III, in the photograph above, depicts what the embryo looks like during the globular stage. 1 is indicating the location of the endosperm. The important component of the globular phase is the introduction of the rest of the primary meristematic tissue. The protoderm was already introduced during the sixteen cell stage. According to Evert and Eichhorn, the ground meristem and procambium are initiated during the globular stage. The ground meristem will go on to form the ground tissue, which includes the pith and cortex. The procambium will eventually form the vascular tissue, which includes the xylem and phloem.

=== Heart stage ===
According to Evert and Eichhorn, the heart stage is a transition period where the cotyledons finally start to form and elongate. It is given this name in eudicots because most plants from this group have two cotyledons, giving the embryo a heart shaped appearance. The shoot apical meristem is between the cotyledons. Stage IV, in the illustration above, indicates what the embryo looks like at this point in development. 5 indicates the position of the cotyledons.

=== Proembryo stage ===
The proembryo stage is defined by the continued growth of the cotyledons and axis elongation. In addition, programmed cell death must occur during this stage. This is carried out throughout the entire growth process, like any other development. However, in the torpedo stage of development, parts of the suspensor complex must be terminated. The suspensor complex is shortened because at this point in development most of the nutrition from the endosperm has been utilized, and there must be space for the mature embryo. After the suspensor complex is gone, the embryo is fully developed. Stage V, in the illustration above, indicates what the embryo looks like at this point in development.

=== Maturation ===
The second phase, or postembryonic development, involves the maturation of cells, which involves cell growth and the storage of macromolecules (such as oils, starches and proteins) required as a &#x27;food and energy supply&#x27; during germination and seedling growth. In this stage, the seed coat hardens to help protect the embryo and store available nutrients. The appearance of a mature embryo is seen in Stage VI, in the illustration above.

== Dormancy ==
The end of embryogenesis is defined by an arrested development phase, or stop in growth. This phase usually coincides with a necessary component of growth called dormancy. Dormancy is a period in which a seed cannot germinate, even under optimal environmental conditions, until a specific requirement is met. Breaking dormancy, or finding the specific requirement of the seed, can be rather difficult. For example, a seed coat can be extremely thick. According to Evert and Eichhorn, very thick seed coats must undergo a process called scarification, in order to deteriorate the coating. In other cases, seeds must experience stratification. This process exposes the seed to certain environmental conditions, like cold or smoke, to break dormancy and initiate germination.

== The role of auxin ==

Auxin is a hormone related to the elongation and regulation of plants. It also plays an important role in the establishment polarity with the plant embryo. Research has shown that the hypocotyl from both gymnosperms and angiosperms show auxin transport to the root end of the embryo. They hypothesized that the embryonic pattern is regulated by the auxin transport mechanism and the polar positioning of cells within the ovule. The importance of auxin was shown, in their research, when carrot embryos, at different stages, were subjected to auxin transport inhibitors. The inhibitors that these carrots were subjected to made them unable to progress to later stages of embryogenesis. During the globular stage of embryogenesis, the embryos continued spherical expansion. In addition, oblong embryos continued axial growth, without the introduction of cotyledons. During the heart embryo stage of development, there were additional growth axes on hypocotyls. Further auxin transport inhibition research, conducted on &quot;Brassica juncea&quot;, shows that after germination, the cotyledons were fused and not two separate structures.

== Alternative forms of embryogenesis ==

=== Somatic embryogenesis ===
Somatic embryos are formed from plant cells that are not normally involved in the development of embryos, i.e. ordinary plant tissue. No endosperm or seed coat is formed around a somatic embryo. Applications of this process include: clonal propagation of genetically uniform plant material; elimination of viruses; provision of source tissue for genetic transformation; generation of whole plants from single cells called protoplasts; development of synthetic seed technology. Cells derived from competent source tissue are cultured to form an undifferentiated mass of cells called a callus. Plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium can be manipulated to induce callus formation and subsequently changed to induce embryos to form the callus. The ratio of different plant growth regulators required to induce callus or embryo formation varies with the type of plant. Asymmetrical cell division also seems to be important in the development of somatic embryos, and while failure to form the suspensor cell is lethal to zygotic embryos, it is not lethal for somatic embryos.

=== Androgenesis ===
The process of androgenesis allows a mature plant embryo to form from a reduced, or immature, pollen grain. Androgenesis usually occurs under stressful conditions. Embryos that result from this mechanism can germinate into fully functional plants. As mentioned, the embryo results from a single pollen grain. Pollen grains consists of three cells - one vegetative cell containing two generative cells. According to Maraschin et al., androgenesis must be triggered during the asymmetric division of microspores. However, once the vegetative cell starts to make starch and proteins, androgenesis can no longer occur. Maraschin et al., indicates that this mode of embryogenesis consists of three phases. The first phase is the &quot;acquisition of embryonic potential&quot;, which is the repression of gametophyte formation, so that the differentiation of cells can occur. Then during the &quot;initiation of cell divisions&quot;, multicellular structures begin to form, which are contained by the exine wall. The last step of androgenesis is &quot;pattern formation&quot;, where the embryo-like structures are released out of the exile wall, in order for pattern formation to continue.

After these three phases occur, the rest of the process falls in line with the standard embryogenesis events.

==Plant growth and buds==
Embryonic tissue is made up of actively growing cells and the term is normally used to describe the early formation of tissue in the first stages of growth. It can refer to different stages of the sporophyte and gametophyte plant; including the growth of embryos in seedlings, and to meristematic tissues, which are in a persistently embryonic state, to the growth of new buds on stems.

In both gymnosperms and angiosperms, the young plant contained in the seed, begins as a developing egg-cell formed after fertilization (sometimes without fertilization in a process called apomixis) and becomes a plant embryo.
This embryonic condition also occurs in the buds that form on stems. The buds have tissue that has differentiated but not grown into complete structures. They can be in a resting state, lying dormant over winter or when conditions are dry, and then commence growth when conditions become suitable. Before they start growing into stem, leaves, or flowers, the buds are said to be in an embryonic state.

<text>Morley Kells (born January 26, 1936) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on two separate occasions from 1981 to 1985 and again from 1995 to 2003, and was briefly a cabinet minister in the government of Frank Miller. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Toronto City Council in the 2010 municipal election.

==Background==
Kells was born in Midland, Ontario in 1936. He was raised in the village of Mimico in the southern part of Etobicoke in west Toronto, Ontario. While in high school in Mimico, Morley was initiated into Gamma Sigma Fraternity International, Beta Nu Chapter in 1953. Kells went on to lead the fraternity as Grand President while an active member over many years with the fraternity. Morley attended the 150th anniversary of the founding of Gamma Sigma, in Niagara Falls Ontario in October 2019 with a large group of alumni.

He was a lacrosse player from 1954 to 1961. In 1955 became a Minto Cup champion with the Canadian Junior Lacrosse Long Branch team. He worked as a coach in the 1960s and 1970s, and started the semi-professional Ontario Lacrosse Association in 1972. In 1974–75, he co-founded the National Lacrosse League, with six teams in Canada and the United States. He received the Lester B. Pearson Award for contribution to sport in 1973, and was named to the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1976.

Kells also worked as a journalist, writing for &quot;The Telegram&quot; newspaper and serving as communications accounting executive for MacLaren Advertising. From 1965 to 1970, he served as the creative director for Hockey Night in Canada. From 1990 to 1995, he served as president of the Urban Development Institute of Ontario.

==Municipal politics==
He was elected as an alderman in Etobicoke in 1976, and won a controller&#x27;s seat in 1978. Kells ran for mayor of Etobicoke in 1980, but was defeated by incumbent Dennis Flynn.

He was an unsuccessful candidate for Toronto City Council for Ward 5 (Etobicoke Lakeshore), seeking to unseat incumbent councillor Peter Milczyn in the October 25, 2010 municipal election.

==Provincial politics==
Kells ran for the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1971, losing to New Democratic Party candidate Patrick Lawlor by 735 votes in the Etobicoke riding of Lakeshore.

===1981–1985===
Kells was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1981, outpolling Liberal candidate Jim Mills by over 10,000 votes in the Etobicoke riding of Humber. He was made a parliamentary assistant in 1983. Kells supported Frank Miller&#x27;s successful campaign for the party leadership in January 1985

Premier Miller appointed Kells Minister of the Environment in his new government on February 8, 1985. Kells&#x27; time in cabinet was short-lived. He was not well respected by his staff, and made a rather serious public relations blunder in March 1985. Commenting on a major PCB spill in northern Ontario, he said, &quot;If you&#x27;re a rat eating PCBs on the TransCanada, you might have some problems.&quot; This was widely interpreted as reflecting a lack of concern for serious environmental issues, and did considerable damage to the Miller government.

Early in his ministerial tenure, Kells had intended to announce a $100-million cash infusion for his ministry, with the money to be spent cleaning polluted dump sites and hiring new inspectors. The announcement was postponed, however, when the Miller government decided to de-emphasize social initiatives in favour of fiscal responsibility in the 1985 campaign.

Kells would never get the chance to deliver this message. He lost to Liberal candidate Jim Henderson by almost 2,000 votes in the 1985 provincial election, in which the Tories were reduced to a minority.


===1995–2003===
In the provincial election of 1995, Kells ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore, and defeated incumbent New Democrat Ruth Grier and Liberal Bruce Davis by a significant margin. He was reportedly annoyed at not being appointed to the cabinet of Mike Harris, however, and played only a limited role in the parliament that followed. He did not serve as a parliamentary assistant, and did not even serve on any committees after 1997. He did serve as a member of the Red Tape Commission of MPPs.

Kells&#x27; riding was targeted by both the Liberal and NDP in the 1999 provincial election, but he managed to win re-election by a significant margin (defeating Liberal Laurel Broten by almost 5,000 votes). Once again, he played only a limited role in the parliament which followed.

The Tories had lost much of their Toronto-area support by the time of the 2003 election, and Kells lost to Broten by just over 5,000 votes in a rematch from 1999.

==Federal politics==
Morley Kells was a candidate for the nomination of the Conservative Party of Canada in Etobicoke-Lakeshore on May 5, 2005, although he was defeated by the 2004 federal candidate John Capobianco.

<doc id="1251836" wikidata="Q1323629" url="?curid=1251836" title="Gulf St Vincent">
<text>Gulf St Vincent, sometimes referred to as St Vincent Gulf, St Vincent&#x27;s Gulf or Gulf of St Vincent, is the eastern of two large inlets of water on the southern coast of Australia, in the state of South Australia, the other being the larger Spencer Gulf, from which it is separated by Yorke Peninsula. On its eastern side the gulf is bordered by the Adelaide Plains and the Fleurieu Peninsula.

== Description ==
The St Vincent basin is formed from Cenozoic sediments deposited over, and surrounded by, Proterozoic and Paleozoic rock. Around 55 million years ago Gondwanaland broke up and Australia separated from Antarctica, causing a number of basins to form along the southern Australian coastline. Around 40 million years ago a number of blocks formed with the Mount Lofty Ranges rising to the east of the St Vincent basin. At the end of the Last Glacial Maximum around 10,000-15,000 years ago, the sea levels rose and covered the St. Vincent basin.

==Location==
To the south it is defined by a line from Troubridge Point on Yorke Peninsula to Cape Jervis on Fleurieu Peninsula. Its entrances from the southwest are from Investigator Strait, and to the southeast from Backstairs Passage, which separate Kangaroo Island from the mainland. Adelaide lies midway along the gulf&#x27;s east shore. Other towns located on the gulf include, from west to east, Edithburgh, Stansbury, Port Vincent and Ardrossan on the west coast, and Port Wakefield and Normanville on the east coast.

== History ==
The Aboriginal name given to it by the original inhabitants of the area, the Kaurna people was Wongajerla, also spelt Wongga Yerlo or Wonggayerlo, meaning &quot;western sea&quot;.

It was named Gulph of St. Vincent by Matthew Flinders on 30 March 1802, in honour of Admiral John Jervis (1st Earl of St Vincent) who won a naval victory off Cape St. Vincent, Portugal. It was shortly afterwards (after his meeting with Flinders at Encounter Bay on 8 April 1802) mapped by Nicolas Baudin, who named it Golfe de la Mauvaise or Golfe de la Misanthrophie. In the following year Louis de Freycinet renamed it Golphe Josephine to honour Josephine Bonaparte.

Due to Flinders&#x27; lengthy imprisonment on Mauritius during his return to England, the publication of Baudin&#x27;s map preceded that of Flinders by three years.

The Adelaide Desalination Plant which is located on Gulf St Vincent&#x27;s eastern shore in Lonsdale, supplies the Adelaide metropolitan area with desalinated water from the gulf. It officially opened in 2013.

==Environment==
The Gulf teems with crustacea and polychaeta, as well as various species of sea squirts and sea urchins. The benthos is a soft sediment shelf, with species of zosteraceae around the mouth of the Port River. The cardinalfish genus &quot;Vincentia&quot; takes its name from Gulf St Vincent where the type specimen of its type species was collected.

<text>The Liverpool Institute High School for Boys was an all-boys grammar school in the English port city of Liverpool.

The school had its origins in 1825 but occupied different premises while the money was found to build a dedicated building on Mount Street. The institute was first known as the Liverpool Mechanics&#x27; School of Arts. In 1832 the name was shortened to the Liverpool Mechanics&#x27; Institution. The façade of the listed building, the entrance hall and modified school hall remain after substantial internal reconstruction was completed in the early 1990s.

==School history in brief==
Its initial primary purpose as a mechanics&#x27; institute (one of many established about this time throughout the country) was to provide educational opportunities, mainly through evening classes, for working men. Lectures for the general public were also provided of wide interest covering topics ranging from Arctic exploration to Shakespeare and philosophy. Luminaries like Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope and Ralph Waldo Emerson delivered talks and readings in the main lecture hall (now the architecturally restructured Sir Paul McCartney Auditorium of LIPA).

By 1840 the Institution offered evening classes, lectures, a library and a boys&#x27; lower and upper school. By the 1850s a formal art school was evolving from the evening classes and in 1856 this diversity was recognised by another name change – The Liverpool Institute and School of Arts.

A girls&#x27; school was founded and opened in 1844 under the name Liverpool Institute High School for Girls. It was housed in a merchant&#x27;s mansion across the street from the boys&#x27; school in Blackburne House provided by the generosity of George Holt and which was later (1872) donated to the school by his family in his memory. The school was one of the first which was open to the public in the country established exclusively for the education of girls.

In 1905 the Liverpool City Council took over the management of the secondary schools when the LI Board of Governors presented the school and assets to the City. From then until its closure in 1985, the school was formally known as &quot;The Liverpool Institute High School for Boys&quot; or more familiarly as &quot;The Institute&quot; or &quot;The Inny&quot; to its pupils.

It was an English grammar school for boys ages 11 to 18 with an excellent academic reputation built up over more than a century. Its list of scholarships and places at Oxford and Cambridge runs to some 300 names – in addition to distinctions gained at the University of Liverpool and many other prominent British universities. The school was a true measure of Liverpool&#x27;s intellectual capital, and its old boys could and can be found in later life in many fields of professional distinction including the law, the Church, armed forces, politics, academia, government and colonial administration as well as in trade and commerce.

In the 1950s, two of the future Beatles, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, were educated at the school.

==Closure of the school==
The school was closed by the city council in 1985. The Labour Party nationally opposed grammar schools – see Anthony Crosland&#x27;s Circular of September 1965 required that Local Authorities bring forward schemes for comprehensive secondary education. As grammar school pupils were selected by examination at age 11, there was a long-standing push towards &#x27;comprehensive schools&#x27; (as non-selective schools were known) from that party when it took majority control of the City Council in 1983. Demand for secondary school places in the City had also dropped precipitously and there was a huge oversupply of school space as Liverpool&#x27;s population contracted during the severe economic recession of the early 1980s.

The Deputy Leader of the Labour (Militant) Group on Council at the time was a former LI schoolboy Derek Hatton who had left without academic distinction in 1964 and with strong feelings of dislike towards the school. However the man who was Chair of the Educational Committee at the time of the decision to close the school was Dominic Brady, whose qualifications for his position amounted to being a former school caretaker.

After closure, the building stood empty and neglected, the roof leaking and the walls crumbling. In 1987 it was announced that the LI Trust (under control of Liverpool Council&#x27;s Education Department) would grant use of the building and site to a new educational establishment. Paul McCartney had returned to his old school in 1979, when with the band Wings he had played a concert at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool. After the school&#x27;s closure in 1985, McCartney returned one night to reminisce about his school days, while he was writing his &#x27;Liverpool Oratorio&#x27;. This visit is captured in &#x27;Echoes&#x27;; a DVD which accompanies the &quot;Liverpool Oratoria&quot; box set. McCartney was determined to save the building somehow and during a conversation with Sir George Martin, the idea of a &#x27;fame school&#x27; emerged as Martin was helping Mark Featherstone-Witty start a London secondary school with an innovative curriculum. McCartney and Featherstone-Witty joined forces to create the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA) opening in 1996. The new company took over the Liverpool Institute Trust which had its origins in 1905.

The building was rebuilt (entirely in parts) behind its old façade and re-opened in 1996 under LIPA&#x27;s name. The new institute is affiliated with Liverpool John Moores University and is no longer a Liverpool secondary school.

==Art school==

The city&#x27;s Art College had its origins as part of the Liverpool Institute. In 1883 a new building housing the School of Art was opened around the corner on Hope Street, adjacent to the principal building housing the High School on Mount Street. The Art College by which it was later known, took in talented students often without formal academic credentials (e.g. John Lennon) and the college eventually became one of the four constituent parts of the Liverpool Polytechnic in 1970 and later in 1992 Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) with the School of Art and Design being housed in the Art and Design Academy.

==Liverpool Institute and music==

Music and musical performances were a constant theme throughout the life of the school and the Mount St. building. Annual school Speech Day concerts (held in the fine acoustics of Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool), choirs, the organ, piano, music classes and the singing of daily devotional hymns have echoed around its walls for 170 years and continue to do so at LIPA:

<doc id="1251844" wikidata="Q7718627" url="?curid=1251844" title="The Block (Sydney)">
<text>The Block is a colloquial but universally applied name given to a residential block of social housing in the suburb of Redfern, Sydney, bound by Eveleigh, Caroline, Louis, and Vine Streets. Beginning in 1973, houses on this block were purchased over a period of 30 years by the Aboriginal Housing Company (AHC; originally Aboriginal Housing Committee) for use as a project in Aboriginal-managed housing. The Block has been progressively demolished and redeveloped since around 2010, as part of the Pemulwuy Project, completed in mid-2023. There is new housing, including student accommodation in the Col James Student Accommodation building, as well as a gymnasium, Indigenous art gallery, and underground car parking. Murals have been refreshed along the railway wall. 

==Location==
The Block is probably the most famous feature of the suburb of Redfern, although it is located on the western border of that suburb, on the edge of Darlington. Eveleigh Street is its eastern border, with railway lines on the other side of that street, and The Block used to be referred to as Eveleigh Street. Many Aboriginal men living in the area used to work at the Eveleigh St Railyards The Block is near Redfern station.
==Aboriginal Housing Company==
The area was significant as an affordable source of low-cost housing for disadvantaged Aboriginal people. The Block has historically been the subject of large protests, starting in the early 1970s, when landlords in the area conducted a campaign of evicting all Aboriginal residents. Developer Ian Kiernan, who later founded Clean Up Australia, acquired around half of the housing in The Block in the early 1970s via his company Tierra del Fuego. A number of &quot;Goomies&quot; (Aboriginal homeless people) were squatting in his properties, and he called the police several times to evict them. The confrontations with police led to publicity via television news, which alerted the Whitlam government to the situation. 

A group of campaigners, led by future judge Bob Bellear and his wife Kay, along with the Catholic priest Ted Kennedy, lobbied the federal Whitlam government, who bought up Kiernan&#x27;s and other private properties. Kiernan&#x27;s construction company, IBK Construction Pty Ltd, sold the houses at a cost price and was tasked with redeveloping the site, promising to hire additional Aboriginal people to complete the work. Kiernan said that he would not be making a profit, and saw it as &quot;our contribution, and because we think people should get behind a responsible government which is doing something for the under-privileged&quot;. The Bellears lobbied the government for a grant via H. C. Coombs, chair of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs, in December 1972. In April 1973, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Gordon Bryant announced on Sunday a federal government grant of A$530,000. This grant allowed the Aboriginal Housing Committee (AHC), an interim committee which later became the Aboriginal Housing Company, to commence purchasing houses. The Builders Labourers Federation was very supportive, and key to convincing Whitlam to enter the arrangement. Bob and Sol Bellear attended the auctions, and properties were acquired cheaply. There was some debate whether they to form a co-operative, but eventually it was decided to register as a company, with many shareholders and a board. Richard Pacey was appointed as director of the board, and the company had access to funding by the Aboriginal Development Commission for repairs. The company was incorporated in 1973.

The narrow back yards were combined into a large communal area and landscape, and included a children&#x27;s playground. The mayor of South Sydney Council, W. C. Hartup, sent a telegram to Whitlam in protest against the decision to redevelop the housing.

Other people involved in the early days were Bob&#x27;s brother Sol Bellear; Lyall Munro Jnr and his wife Jenny Munro; Gary Foley; Paul Coe and his sister Isabel Coe; Billy Craigie (later Isabel&#x27;s husband); Gary Williams; Naomi Mayers; retired boxer Dick Blair (1937–2013), aka Pastor Richard Phillips, then a field officer for South Sydney Community Aid; and non-Indigenous architect Col James (1936–2013). 

As houses became available for occupation, priority was given to women with children. Later, a hostel was built at the end of Eveleigh Street to house the homeless people. &quot;New Dawn&quot; published an article about the Redfern Housing Project in February 1974. According to Col James, &quot;Redfern was the first urban land rights [case]; that’s why it is a really important site in historical terms&quot;.

A year after the Fraser government was elected in 1975, it terminated capital works funding to The Block, leading to many homes falling into disrepair. Over the following few years, the AHCacquired almost half the properties on the Block, and the election of the Hawke–Keating government in 1983 led to renewed support for the Aboriginal community in Redfern. In 1994 the AHC acquired the last house on the Block.

According to Col James, although the housing worked really well for its first ten years, it was found that fixed rents led to overcrowding, and there were rent arrears and not enough coming in for ongoing maintenance and repairs. After these issues were sorted, there was a decade in which the AHC secured funding to build new housing, starting with the redevelopment of houses on the corner of Caroline and Louis Streets. There were tensions between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal residents, exacerbated by alcohol abuse and an influx of Aboriginal people from country areas. An incident which involved the destruction by fire of some white residents&#x27; home after some Aboriginal children threw firecrackers through an open (in retribution for an earlier incident), and there were calls to shut down the AHC. A report was commissioned by Pat O&#x27;Shane, then director of NSW Aboriginal Affairs. Leonie Sandercock, then professor of planning at Macquarie University, Canadian social planner Wendy Sarkissian, Col James, and Ivor Lloyd, an African American man, were involved in the study. Recommending that much of the English-style terraced housing, which faced and west, should be demolished, this led to a &quot;third phase&quot; of development around 2002, in which of Aboriginal culture and needs should be prioritised. It was also important to create affordable, sustainable, and adaptable housing. City West Housing Company, which created housing in the Ultimo/Pyrmont area, was looked to as a model. The 2002-4 Community Social Plan developed by Angie Pitts for AHC won an international award for its crime prevention through environmental design. It also addressed the issue of what Col James called a &quot;mission mentality&quot; among some residents, by advocating a mixed model, with at least 42 households owning their homes, and around 20 tenants forming five households, for mutual support. 

In 2010, the Aboriginal Housing Company decided to demolish a part of The Block that had deteriorated into a slum. By 2014, the character was changing; young professionals were moving into the area, and there were houses advertised for rent in Eveleigh Street for between A$1000 and A$1200 per week. 

In 2017 it was reported that the core founding group comprised eight people, of whom Lyall Munro was the only one still alive.

===Pemulwuy Project===
The AHC&#x27;s plan for the redevelopment of The Block, known as The Pemulwuy Project (after the 18th-century Bidjigal warrior Pemulwuy), was met with some opposition by the state government in 2008. Demolition of The Block was announced in late 2010, which led to some opposition, including the Redfern Aboriginal Tent Embassy (based on the idea of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy set up in Canberra in 1972), set up in 2014 by Lyall Munro Jnr, his wife Jenny Munro, and other activists, to protest against the redevelopment.

During the 2010s and 2020s, the Block has been the site of many developments.

In March 2017, there was a meeting of around 200 people at the Redfern Community Centre, which had been called to enable the community to ask the AHC about its plans to increase the size of the development. At that time, Alisi Tutuila was chair of the AHC, and Lani Tuitavake was general manager. Many criticised the move, and Lyall Munro (sole survivor of the original eight founders) spoke out against it. It appeared that divisions had emerged between the AHC and sections of the community since the early days. Critics say that the AHC, as a private operator, has abandoned its roots as a community organisation.

On 14 June 2017, AHC submitted the development application to the NSW Department of Planning for Precinct 3, the Col James Accommodation, comprising 522 rooms, located on the eastern side of Eveleigh Street, next to the railway line. Student housing provider Altira is responsible for construction and management of the accommodation. The Col James Student Accommodation building, designed by Turner Studios, provides accommodation for 596 students. The final version of the plans was approved in March 2019, and includes a 24-storey building, with a three-storey building comprising services and common rooms for the students across a courtyard.

In June 2019, the iconic mural featuring the Aboriginal Flag, painted on the side of the Elouera Tony Mundine Gym, was demolished. In its place there would be an underground car park and 36 townhouses will be constructed above it. As of 2020, Mick Mundine was CEO of the AHC.

The design of the Pemulwuy Project won an award for development excellence in 2021. A complex designed by Nordon Jago comprising housing, gymnasium, and Indigenous art gallery was recognised at the Urban Taskforce Development Excellence Awards in November 2021. The railway wall, previously covered with Aboriginal-themed murals, was retained, with the original artist, Danny Eastwood, commissioned to do the repainting of the murals.

On 25 July 2023, there was a joint celebration of the Aboriginal Housing Company&#x27;s 50th birthday, and the official completion of the Pemulwuy Project.

==2004 Redfern riot==

On 14 February 2004, The Block was the scene of 2004 Redfern riots following the death of an Aboriginal boy, TJ Hickey. Hickey died after, while on his bicycle, he collided with a protruding gutter, was flung into the air and was impaled on a fence outside a block of units off Phillip Street, Waterloo, as he was fleeing police. Hickey was transported from the scene to the Sydney Children&#x27;s Hospital in a critical but stable condition. He died with his family by his side on 15 February due to the severity of his wounds.

The community were upset about the death, and riots ensued. Redfern railway station was damaged by fire. The ticketing area and station master&#x27;s office were significantly damaged, and the windows in the front of the station were bricked up for almost a year afterwards to prevent further attacks. They were later replaced with glass windows.

<doc id="1251848" wikidata="Q1940211" url="?curid=1251848" title="The Unraveling (Rise Against album)">
<text>The Unraveling is the debut studio album by American punk rock band Rise Against, released on April 24, 2001 by Fat Wreck Chords. Following the release of the extended play &quot;Transistor Revolt&quot; in 2000, the band signed with Fat Wreck Chords and began working on the album at Sonic Iguana Studios with producer Mass Giorgini. Musically, &quot;The Unraveling&quot; is rooted in melodic hardcore, which later came to be the band’s signature style; conversely, its lyrics differ from their more politically-driven later work, focusing more on personal relationships and issues.

Although it failed to peak within any record charts, &quot;The Unraveling&quot; received positive reviews from music critics. After its release, guitarist Dan Wleklinski left the band due to personal differences with lead vocalist Tim McIlrath, and was eventually replaced with Todd Mohney. In 2005, Fat Wreck Chords reissued &quot;The Unraveling&quot; to coincide with Rise Against&#x27;s fifth anniversary.

==Background and recording==
Rise Against was formed in 1999 after the dissolution of the Chicago punk rock band 88 Fingers Louie. Bassist Joe Principe and guitarist Dan Wleklinski were still interested in making music, and decided to start a new band. The two recruited drummer Toni Tintari, guitarist Kevin White, and lead vocalist Tim McIlrath, the former lead vocalist of the punk band Baxter. They called themselves Transistor Revolt, and released the extended play &quot;Transistor Revolt&quot; in 2000. &quot;Transistor Revolt&quot; garnered the attention of Fat Mike, the co-founder of the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords. He signed the band to a recording contract in 2000, with the stipulation they change their name; the band members ultimately decided on the name Rise Against.

After signing with Fat Wreck Chords, Tintari and White left Rise Against; Tintari was replaced by Brandon Barnes shortly thereafter. With a new drummer, the band members began to work on &quot;The Unraveling&quot; at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, Indiana, where Principe and Wleklinski had previously recorded material for 88 Fingers Louie. Recording took place over the course of five weeks, with Mass Giorgini serving as the producer, and Wleklinski serving as the assistant engineer. Wleklinski later remarked on the grueling workdays: &quot;12-hour days for 4 of those weeks, and then 22-24 hours per day during that last week of tracking. These were the times of &#x27;If you don&#x27;t play it right, you have to play it again,&#x27; not &#x27;That was good enough, I&#x27;ll edit it so it&#x27;s on time.&#x27;&quot; Wleklinski also commented that it was difficult to split his time between recording guitar parts and engineering the songs, and that during the last week he had to sleep on the studio floor.

==Style and composition==
&quot;The Unraveling&quot; is primarily a melodic hardcore record, with influences of punk rock and hardcore punk. Shawn Merrill of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; compared the album to works by other punk rock bands like Agnostic Front, Bad Religion, Gorilla Biscuits, and Minor Threat. &quot;The Unraveling&quot; begins with a quote by actor and musician Jack Black asking the listener &quot;Are you ready to rock?&quot;, taken from the 1996 film &quot;The Cable Guy&quot;. It then transitions into the first track &quot;Alive and Well&quot;, a fast-paced song that combines screaming vocals with melodies in the chorus. Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic considers the second track, &quot;My Life Inside Your Heart&quot;, to be the most accessible song on the album, while &quot;Great Awakening&quot; has a &quot;frantic pace&quot; with a hardcore sound. The next song &quot;Six Ways &#x27;Til Sunday&quot; is more inspired by punk rock, with a long closing group chant.

Boy notes that tracks five through ten alternate between short hardcore songs like &quot;The Art of Losing&quot; and 
&quot;Remains of Summer Memories&quot;, and more conventional sounding songs like &quot;The Unraveling&quot;. The eleventh track, &quot;Everchanging&quot;, begins with minimal background music to highlight McIlrath&#x27;s vocals. After two more hardcore songs, &quot;1000 Good Intentions&quot; begins playing, which James Benwell of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; compared to &quot;Everchanging&quot;. Boy adds that the track is reminiscent of the sound of future Rise Against albums, with its punk base combined with more mainstream rock influence. The final two tracks, &quot;Weight of Time&quot; and &quot;Faint Resemblance&quot;, close the album in a &quot;nice summation of everything that has come before them&quot;, according to Boy. Lyrically, &quot;The Unraveling&quot; is intended to be thought-provoking, with themes ranging from &quot;friendships and relationships [to] religion and memories&quot;.

==Release and reception==
===Release===
Fat Wreck Chords released &quot;The Unraveling&quot; on April 24, 2001, in the United States on CD and LP formats; the original 2001 CD pressing is currently out of print. It failed to reach any major music chart, and did not produce a single. Since the album&#x27;s release, some of its songs have been featured in compilation albums and other media. An acoustic rendition of &quot;Everchanging&quot; was included on the &quot;Warped Tour 2006 Tour Compilation&quot; and the European track listing of the 2007 extended play &quot;This Is Noise&quot;. &quot;The Art of Losing&quot; and &quot;My Life Inside Your Heart&quot; were to be used in the unreleased video game &quot;Propeller Arena&quot;.

To promote &quot;The Unraveling&quot;, Rise Against toured extensively throughout North America and Europe. While on tour, Wleklinski left the band due to personal differences with McIlrath. Rumor spread that Wleklinski was fired because of his long hair, although McIlrath derided these claims. Phillip Hill stood in as lead guitarist, and Kevin White was eventually hired as a replacement. A few months later, White left the band, and Todd Mohney was recruited as the new lead guitarist.

In 2005, Fat Wreck Chords reissued &quot;The Unraveling&quot; on CD and digital download format to coincide with the band&#x27;s fifth anniversary. It was remixed and remastered by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with two bonus songs (&quot;Join the Ranks&quot; and &quot;Gethsemane&quot;), updated photography, and additional album liner information. Mohney plays lead guitar on &quot;Gethsemane&quot;, as the track was recorded after Wlekinski&#x27;s departure.

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Unraveling&quot; received positive reviews upon its initial release. Merrill praised the album&#x27;s music, and described Rise Against as the &quot;hardcore salvation&quot; he had been waiting for. Boy wrote that he was initially skeptical about listening to the album, but ultimately called it &quot;a surprisingly accomplished work that contains all of the band&#x27;s trademark strengths&quot;. He also highlighted the musicianship between the band members. Benwell noted that while the music was not innovative, it was still a &quot;perfectly formed slab of uplifting punk rock&quot;, and recommended the album to any hardcore punk fans. AllMusic&#x27;s Kurt Morris commented that Rise Against was different than other Fat Wreck Chords bands at the time, as there was no poppy songs or juvenile humor in the lyrics. He felt that the music was &quot;pure and unadulterated&quot;, and that &quot;The Unraveling&quot; would revitalize moshing.

The 2005 reissue was also met with positive reviews. AltSounds highlighted the improved sound quality and called it a &quot;must have for any Rise Against fan&quot;. Sputnikmusic also noted the improved sound quality, but criticized the positioning of each song in the track list. The reviewer wrote that certain songs felt out of place when paired next to each other, and wondered why the track listing had not been altered for the reissue.

<text>Revolutions per Minute is the second studio album by American punk rock band Rise Against, released on April 8, 2003, by Fat Wreck Chords. After establishing a fanbase with their 2001 debut, &quot;The Unraveling&quot;, the band members wanted to record an album that distinguished them from other Fat Wreck Chords bands of the time. They chose Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore to produce the album, with whom they developed a strong rapport. Recording took place from November to December 2002 at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado.

Musically, &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; is rooted in hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. Critics noted that the album exhibited greater musical maturity and an overall darker tone when compared to its predecessor. It comprises thirteen songs, with lyrical themes ranging from relationships and politics. To promote the album, Rise Against toured extensively with other Fat Wreck Chords bands, and participated in the 2003 Warped Tour.

Upon its release, the album peaked at number 35 on the Independent Albums chart, and was praised for its impassioned lyrics and unique blend of genres. Some critics called it one of the best albums of the year. According to Bryne Yancey of Punknews.org, &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; not only popularized the melodic hardcore genre, but also influenced &quot;literally thousands of bands&quot; with its music and social commentary. The album also introduced several aspects that would become common traits in Rise Against&#x27;s newer material, such as extensive social commentary, and reliance on musical accessibility. In 2013, Fat Wreck Chords re-released the album with ten bonus demos and expanded packaging.

==Background and recording==

In April 2001, Rise Against released its debut studio album &quot;The Unraveling&quot; through Fat Wreck Chords. Although the album failed to reach any major music charts, it did receive positive reviews from critics, and helped establish a steady fanbase for the band. After the release of &quot;The Unraveling&quot;, guitarist Dan Wleklinski left the band due to personal differences with lead vocalist Tim McIlrath; he was eventually replaced by Todd Mohney, McIlrath&#x27;s roommate and former bandmate.

When it came time to record Rise Against&#x27;s second album, &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot;, McIlrath noted that the band was suffering from an &quot;identity crisis&quot;. At the time, Fat Wreck Chords had a specific pop punk sound, so the band members wanted to find a producer who could help distinguish them from the other bands on the label, and highlight the heavier aspects of their music. Sonic Iguana Studios, where Rise Against recorded &quot;The Unraveling&quot;, and another studio in San Francisco were both busy at the time, leaving the band members only thirty days to record. They decided on Bill Stevenson—the former drummer of the punk band Descendents—and Jason Livermore to produce the album.

Before the recording process began, the band members wrote songs for the album above an antique store in Chicago, an environment that McIlrath described as &quot;roach-infested&quot;. &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; was recorded at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, from November to December 2002. Stevenson and Livermore produced the album; Stevenson also served as the engineer and mixer, while Livermore mastered the album. McIlrath commented that Stevenson was the perfect person to produce the album, as he not only understood the nuances of the band, but was also their &quot;musical soul mate&quot;. &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; was the first album that McIlrath played guitar on. He was nervous about playing the guitar, as no one had ever scrutinized his ability, and described the process as &quot;playing blindly into the wind and hoping it was good enough&quot;.

==Composition==
Musically, &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; is rooted in hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. Stuart Green of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; opined that the album exhibited greater musical maturity when compared to &quot;The Unraveling&quot;, specifically for the inclusion of mood and texture. These comments were echoed by Punknews.org&#x27;s Aubin Paul, who noted the album&#x27;s overall &quot;darker&quot; tone.

The first track on &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; is &quot;Black Masks &amp; Gasoline&quot;, which features &quot;power chords&quot; and rapid drumming. Its lyrics advocate for a revolution against a vengeful government, and contain imagery of raised hands and clenched fists. The second track, &quot;Heaven Knows&quot;, makes use of &quot;serrated, slingshot hooks&quot;, with lyrics that deal with &quot;personal strife&quot;. The next track, &quot;Dead Ringer&quot;, is a short hardcore song that chastises those who felt that the band had sold out due to their growing popularity. Jo-Ann Greene of AllMusic believes that &quot;Halfway There&quot; is about the need for a real leader and questioning the current leaders&#x27; action, bolstered by McIlrath&#x27;s screaming vocals.

The fifth track, &quot;Like the Angel&quot;, begins with strumming of the bass guitar, before transitioning into a &quot;poppy&quot; beat about unrequited love. &quot;Voices Off Camera:&quot; is one of the more accessible songs on the album, with McIlrath singing in a softer voice. In contrast, &quot;Blood-Red, White, &amp; Blue&quot; is described by Matthew Fiander of &quot;PopMatters&quot; as a &quot;musical tour de force&quot;, with a moody breakdown. With it, McIlrath wanted to write a song that showcased the conflict of interests following the September 11 attacks, between overt patriotism, and war crimes in the name of God. The eighth track, &quot;Broken English&quot;, &quot;switches tempo constantly&quot;, and has motivational lyrics in the chorus. McIlrath describes &quot;Last Chance Blueprint&quot; as the band&#x27;s &quot;escape song&quot;, while Fiander feels it is a &quot;stock get-out-of-town tune&quot;. It contains a soundbite from the 1999 film &quot;American Beauty&quot;.

&quot;To the Core&quot; is another short hardcore song that Greene describes as &quot;a ferocious, fever-pitched number written and delivered with pure vitriol&quot;. McIlarth notes that &quot;Torches&quot; is a very different when compared to most of the band&#x27;s material, due to its heavy metal-influenced intro and breakdown. The penultimate track, &quot;Amber Changing&quot;, is more muted in its sound, and has McIlrath sing about not wanting a great moment in a relationship to end. The album ends with a hidden track, a cover of &quot;Any Way You Want It&quot; by Journey. The band covered the song to bring a sense of familiarity to listeners while on tour.

==Release and reception==
Fat Wreck Chords released &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; on April 8, 2003, in the United States on CD and LP formats. Like &quot;The Unraveling&quot;, it failed to reach any major music chart, but did reach number thirty-five on the Independent Albums chart. Promotion for the album included North American and Japan based tours with other Fat Wreck Chord bands like Anti-Flag, None More Black, and No Use for a Name, and several performances in the 2003 Warped Tour in North America. Additionally, &quot;Like the Angel&quot; was released as a promotional single.

&quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; was well received by music critics. Paul praised the album for its honest and personal lyrics, as well as its unique blend of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. He concluded by declaring it one of the best albums of the year, a sentiment which was shared by &quot;The Virginian-Pilot&quot; Jeff Maisey. Greene liked the juxtaposition of impassioned and political lyrics, commenting that the album is capable of &quot;rubbing emotions raw and minds numb&quot;. Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic felt that with &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot;, Rise Against took their craft and musicianship more seriously. He commented that while the songs themselves do not work well individually, &quot;the band should be given credit for how even and consistent the album still is, and for the fact that it is a solid and cohesive listen.&quot;

===Impact and re-release===
Bryne Yancey of Punknews.org notes that in the early 2000s, melodic hardcore was not a well established genre. With the release of &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot;, Yancey argues Rise Against not only popularized the genre, but also influenced &quot;literally thousands of bands residing somewhere within the melodic hardcore spectrum&quot; with the album&#x27;s music and social commentary. &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; was also an important album for Rise Against, as Boy believes it &quot;clearly played a huge role in shaping what was to come&quot; for the band. It was their first album to make extensive use of social and political commentary, which has become a staple for Rise Against material. Some songs like &quot;Voices Off Camera:&quot; and &quot;Broken English&quot; demonstrated a greater reliance on musical accessibility, which &quot;hinted&quot; at the band&#x27;s eventual shift toward mainstream rock.

To commemorate the tenth anniversary of &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot;, Fat Wreck Chords re-released the album as &quot;RPM10&quot; on May 28, 2013. The re-release features ten bonus demo tracks and expanded packaging, but omits the cover of &quot;Any Way You Want It&quot; from the original release. Yancey felt that album held up surprisingly well, and that while the demos were interesting, they were unessential. In contrast, Fiander did not think that the lyrical content had aged well, and that the demos were only &quot;slightly more ragged versions of the album cuts&quot;.

<text>Delta Delta Delta (), also known as Tri Delta, is a women&#x27;s fraternity and Greek life organization founded on November 27, 1888 at Boston University.

==History==
The founders of ΔΔΔ:

Delta Delta Delta was founded by Sarah Ida Shaw, Eleanor Dorcas Pond, Florence Isabelle Stewart, and Isabel Morgan Breed at Boston University. Three women&#x27;s fraternities were already represented at Boston University (Kappa Kappa Gamma, Gamma Phi Beta, and Alpha Phi). Shaw enlisted the help of Dorcas Pond, stating, &quot;Let us found a society that shall be kind alike to all and think more of a girl&#x27;s inner self and character than of her personal appearance.&quot;

The two started a new national fraternity in 1888. Later Shaw wrote, &quot;...They were working for a principle, and it never occurred to them that there could be such a thing as failure. Earnestness of purpose, energy and enthusiasm had brought them both success in college and why should not these same qualities bring assurance of good fortune to the new venture.&quot;

Shaw and Pond wrote the rituals and constitution, designed the emblems, and mutually decided on the name. Pond suggested a triple letter, while Shaw chose the actual letter, developing Greek mottos and passwords. Inspiration came from Ancient Egypt, Greek mythology, Hindu, and astronomy, reflecting Shaw&#x27;s varied interests.

On October 2, 1914, Shaw formed Psi Psi Psi or Tri Psi, a sorority for the mothers of Delta Delta Delta members.

The organization partnered with St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in 1999, and has raised more than $100 million to support St. Jude patients and their families as of 2024.

==Symbols==
The Greek alphabet letters Delta Delta Delta (ΔΔΔ) are the official symbols. The dolphin is recognized as an additional symbol as it was considered to be a good omen by the ancient Greeks. The colors of Tri Delta are silver, gold, and cerulean blue (made famous in The Devil Wears Prada), while the pearl is its jewel. The sorority recognizes the pansy as its official flower and the pine tree as its official tree.

The coat of arms consists of a quartered shield, first and fourth quarters in blue with a silver trident on each, second and third quarters in gold with green pine tree on each. The sorority crest is placed above the shield and consists of a torse with six folds in alternating gold and blue, from which a white, gold and blue pansy rises. Below the shield, the Greek motto &quot;Asfalos Agapomen Allaylas&quot; (&quot;Let us steadfastly love one another&quot;) is inscribed in Greek characters on a scroll.

An alternative, modernized logo makes use of Tri Delta&#x27;s colors and symbols for branding and marketing.

Prior to initiation, new members wear a new member pin, which is a green and silver enamel badge described as an &quot;inverted Delta surrounded by three Deltas.&quot; A new member may also display a trident, which symbolizes the first degree of initiation and is returned prior to initiation into the Stars and Crescent degree. A gold trident may be worn as a badge guard.

==== Members ====
Tri Delta&#x27;s official member badge is the diamond and pearl-studded, gold Stars and Crescent pin, consisting of three golden stars and a crown set with pearls, within a gold crescent of three hundred degrees bearing three deltas in black enamel. An initiate receives a badge pin with her initials, the Greek letters of her chapter, and her roll and member number engraved on the back. The badge belongs to the sorority and is &quot;lent&quot; to each member during her lifetime or as long as she remains a member, with the requirement that the badge will be returned upon the member&#x27;s death or resignation, unless the executive board grants a special exception.

=====Heist=====
In 2014, Arlington Police Department and various press reported how a team of two &quot;Pulled Off What May Be the Largest Sorority-Pin Heist in History&quot; of 2,000-5,000 of the diamond and pearl studded, gold pins, with the police stating &quot;the pins, which were set with precious and semi-precious stones, are worth about $1.5 million.&quot;

==== Anniversaries ====
Tri Delta also has various circle pins to celebrate years since the member&#x27;s initiation. Introduced in 2004, the Silver Circle Pin may be worn by members who have reached the 25-year anniversary of their initiation. It features the anniversary number engraved on the stars and crescent design. The Golden Circle Pin was originally created by Sarah Ida Shaw for the Circle Degree of Initiation, but its current usage to celebrate 50 years since initiation dates to 1962. This pin consists of three deltas made of gold inside a golden circle, surrounded by six spherical triangles in blue. The Diamond Circle Pin honors members who have served for 75 years with the fraternity. While the design is alike to the Golden Circle Pin, this token features a diamond in the center. This pin was introduced in the year 1996 and the first pin was awarded to Mary K. Wise of Butler University.

===Philanthropy benefiting St. Jude Children===
Many chapters observe &quot;Sleighbell Day&quot; on the first Tuesday of December, following the tradition of Sleighbell Luncheon, first held in the 1940s by 13 Southern California chapters to benefit a doctor researching blood diseases at Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles. In the early 1970s, a national survey established that Tri Delta chapters were interested in children, hospitals, and cancer. At the 1974 Tri Delta Convention, the three were combined to support children&#x27;s cancer charities as the designated philanthropy.

In 1999, Tri Delta partnered with St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital. St. Jude (through the fundraising branch, the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities) assists Tri Delta chapters in planning philanthropy events that benefit the children and subsidize research costs at St. Jude. Many chapters coordinate fundraising activities such as pancake breakfasts, called Delta House of Pancakes or DHOP, and football tailgates on their campuses each year. Since 1999, Tri Delta has raised more than $30 million for St. Jude. In 2002, Tri Deltas committed to raising $1 million to build a Teen Room at the St. Jude Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, fulfilling the commitment in 2005. In July 2006, Tri Delta committed to raise $10 million in 10 years to build a new patient treatment floor focusing on brain tumor research at St. Jude, instead raising $10.4 million in 4 years. In 2010, a new philanthropic goal was announced to raise $15 million in 5 years. On February 1, 2014, it was announced that Tri Delta surpassed the $15 million goal in just 3.5 years. On July 4, 2014, Tri Delta announced a new philanthropic goal to raise $60 million over 10 years, the largest single commitment by a partner of St. Jude in the history of the hospital. Only three-and-a-half years into the 10 year commitment to raise $60 million, Tri Delta hit the halfway point and announced $30 million raised for St. Jude in January 2018. 

====Tri Delta Place at St. Jude====
Their pledge funded the Tri Delta Place, St. Jude&#x27;s only on-campus housing facility. It includes 64 hotel-style rooms and 36 suites. Tri Delta was also named the St. Jude partner of the year for 2014, making Tri Delta the first non-corporation to receive this honor. As of February 2018, Tri Delta has reached the halfway point of this commitment. Since 1999, Tri Delta members have raised more than $70 million to St. Jude. Tri delta continues every year to increase their philanthropy goals for St. Jude.

In addition to the national partnership, Tri Delta continues to raise money for local Children&#x27;s Cancer Charities, including two Canadian Hospitals, the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Canada, and local children&#x27;s cancer charities in various states.

Every year, chapters host a variety of events to raise money for these causes. This includes sporting events such as Greeks at Bat (an inter-fraternity baseball tournament) and Tri Delta Triple Play (kickball tournament), pancake breakfasts commonly named &quot;Delta House of Pancakes,&quot; &quot;Delta Diner,&quot; or &quot;TriHOP&quot;, and spaghetti dinners. Every Tri Delta member also participates in &quot;Sincerely Yours&quot;, an international writing campaign to raise money for St Jude. Other St. Jude specific philanthropic endeavors includes a Gold Level National Team participation in the St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer.

===Museum===
The Ginger Hicks Smith Museum and Archives is based out of Tri Delta&#x27;s Executive Office in Dallas, showcasing the founding and development, and housing some of the organization&#x27;s most precious historical items.

===&quot;The Trident&quot;===
&quot;The Trident&quot; is Tri Delta&#x27;s official magazine, published continuously since 1891. The publication includes news about collegiate and alumni members, chapter events, topics in women&#x27;s health, editorials, and upcoming events.

===Let&#x27;s Talk Tri Delta podcast===
Let&#x27;s Talk Tri Delta is a podcast enabling members to hear directly from board members, experts, and other members on varying issues.

===Other programs===
Besides campus housing managed by Tri Delta Housing, the fraternity offers scholarships and emergency grants, annual conferences and conventions, varied leadership development programs including LeaDDDer.org, platforms like My Tri Delta alumni directory, ConnectDDD.org for online networking, mental health programs, a resource library of bylaws, policy standards (i.e. no hazing), other standardized document guides for varying subjects (i.e. rituals, event planning), etc.

== Chapters ==
==Membership==
===Requirements===
Beyond the competitive bid process (for which &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported on the $4,500 sorority consultant market) which requires a recruitment registration fee, Tri Delta requires a minimum GPA and annual collegiate chapter dues (varies from $1,348-13,690+ including new member fees for state schools in Virginia and Iowa), with higher expenses at higher-tuition schools or cities with higher costs of living.

As part of its DEI initiative, Tri Delta discontinued priority legacy bids (akin to legacy admissions).

===Leadership===
Active members of each Tri Delta chapter may join a committee or be slated into an office in order to serve the organization and develop leadership skills. During the slating process, members adhere to the mantra &quot;The Office Selects the Officer,” and undergo the process of determining the officer that is best suited for each office based on her skills and previous experience.

Each collegiate chapter president oversees chapter business, including membership in every team and committee. Each subsequent office is organized into one of the following teams, each headed by a Vice President: Administration, Chapter Development, Finance, Public Relations, and Membership. Further committees, assistants, and chair positions are tailored to each chapter&#x27;s specific needs. A new officer structure was introduced in 2020 which consists of the collegiate chapter president and Vice Presidents of Operations, Chapter Programming and Development, Community Relations, and Membership Experience. Each officer team consists of one VP and a set of directors.

===Chapter development consultants===
Since 1910, Tri Delta has utilized a consultant program, in which recently graduated alumna members are trained and employed by the executive office to visit chapters to provide resources and advice on their chapter business. Chapter Development Consultants provide constructive feedback in order to align the chapter with standards determined by the executive office. Consultants have gone by many names over the years, including field secretaries and field consultants. In 2015, the name was changed to Chapter Development Consultants.

===Alumnae involvement===
After graduation, alumnae may continue to support Tri Delta and stay active within the Greek community via means such as joining an alumnae chapter, attending and hosting philanthropy events, donating to the Tri Delta Foundation&#x27;s scholarships, contributing to The Trident, writing reference letters for potential new members, and volunteering. Alumnae who wish to stay connected to or make a more direct contribution to a specific collegiate chapter may join its alumnae advisory team. Members volunteering on an international level include members of the National Housing Corporation, who manage fraternity properties, and members of the Foundation.

===Notable members===
== Chapter and individual misconduct ==
Each collegiate chapter is individually managed by local college students, with chapter suspension or charter revocation from the Executive Office upon discovery of misconduct violating organizational values and policy standards, such as no-hazing.

===Southern chapters===
In 2011, the chapter at the University of South Carolina was placed on probation after a party they hosted resulted in 31 citations for underage drinking. The sorority was forced to temporarily suspend all social activities as a result.

In 2013 and 2014, sorority women from multiple chapters at the University of Alabama – including Delta Delta Delta, Pi Beta Phi, Chi Omega, Kappa Delta, Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi, and Phi Mu – alleged that either active members or some of their alumnae had prevented them from offering membership to black candidates because of their race. An anonymous Delta Delta Delta member spoke to the school newspaper, The Crimson White, stating: &quot;To my knowledge, the president and the rush chair and our rush advisors [supported recruiting a black candidate], and if we had been able to pledge her, it would’ve been an honor. However, our [alumnae] stepped in and went over us and had her dropped. The only thing that kept her back was the color of her skin in Tri Delt. She would have been a dog fight between all the sororities if she were white.” Students held a campus march to integrate Greek life on campus, and following media and national outcry, the university held a second round of recruitment in hopes of offering membership to more women, including black women.

In 2015, the chapter at the University of West Georgia was shut down for violating the university&#x27;s policy and code of conduct. Serious allegations of hazing were charged against women of the sorority, and the Tri Delta national executive board refused to release specific details of the investigation.

===Midwest chapters===
In 2009, the chapter at Miami University was suspended for hazing. Pledges were blindfolded and taken off-campus, where they were given an excessive amount of alcohol, causing some women to need medical attention after the incident.

In 2017, the chapter at Indiana University was shut down following an investigation which found that chapter members were &quot;involved in activities that do not represent our high standards or align with Tri Delta&#x27;s purpose.&quot; Chapter members also &quot;violated the chapter&#x27;s previous probation terms.&quot; The national organization declined to specify further, but noted that the chapter had &quot;been on probation for three consecutive semesters, and each time was asked to take responsibility for their actions. Each time ... the chapter chose to ignore advice and recommendations, sending a strong message that they had no intention of making positive change.&quot;

On January 20, 2019, a member of Tri Delta sorority at the University of Oklahoma was removed from the organization after posting a video in which her friend appears wearing blackface and saying a racial slur.

===Eastern state school chapters===
In 2009, the chapter at Pennsylvania State University was shut down due to hazing and endangering new pledges. The Tri Delta national organization refused to release specific details about the investigation.

<text>Cipriano Mera Sanz (4 November 1897 – 24 October 1975) was a Spanish military and political figure during the Second Spanish Republic.

==Early life==

He had two sons (Floreal and Sergio) with his partner Teresa Gómez. A bricklayer, he joined the anarchist movement and presided over the construction union of Madrid of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). During the congress celebrated in Zaragoza three months before the beginning of the Spanish Revolution, he was in favor of the most radical, collaborating sectors of the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI). Mera led a strike of construction workers, electricians, and elevator operators in Madrid in June 1936. As a result, he was imprisoned in early July.

==Spanish Civil War==

When the Spanish Civil War exploded he was released, and led a column that put down the uprising in Guadalajara, Alcalá de Henares and Cuenca. Next, he defended the dams of Lozoya, which supplied Madrid, and fought in the mountain ranges of Ávila and the valley of the Tiétar river. He was given command of the 14th Division and it acted in the defense of Madrid, the Battle of Guadalajara (March 1937) and in the Battle of Brunete (July 1937). He replaced Juan Perea Capulino in command of the IV Army Corps of the center. In April 1938 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.

==The end of the war==

By 1939 Mera was convinced that the Republicans would be defeated. When Juan Negrín refused to surrender to Francisco Franco, Mera decided to support Segismundo Casado, commander of the Republican Army of the center, and Julián Besteiro of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party to stage a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; and establish an anti-Negrin, anti-Stalinist National Defence Council (&quot;Consejo Nacional de Defensa&quot;). In March 1939 he joined the rising of Casado to accelerate the end of the war and to restrain Communist Party of Spain control of the Republican zone. His forces were fundamental in the victory of Casado in Madrid against the 1st Corps of the Army of the Center sent to defeat the rising.

==Exile and death==

He marched to Valencia at the end of the war and soon by plane went to Oran and Casablanca, but he was extradited to Spain in February 1942. In 1943 he was condemned to death, a sentence that was exchanged for 30 years in prison, but he was pardoned in 1946. In 1947, he emigrated to Paris, where he worked as a bricklayer until his death in St. Cloud, France in 1975.

==Films==
He appeared as himself in the 1936 CNT film production &quot;&quot;Castilla Libertaria&quot;. In 2009, a documentary entitled &quot;Vivir de Pie. Las Guerras de Cipriano Mera&quot;&quot; (Living on Your Feet: The Struggles of Cipriano Mera) was released.

<doc id="1251878" wikidata="Q1257270" url="?curid=1251878" title="Red Digital Cinema">
<text>Red Digital Cinema, LLC is an American camera manufacturer specializing in digital cinematography headquartered in Foothill Ranch, California, United States. It has been owned by Nikon since April 2024.

The company has studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles, and has offices in London, Shanghai, and Singapore as well as retail stores in Hollywood, New York City, and Miami. In addition it has various authorized resellers and service centers around the world.

==History==
Red Digital Cinema was founded by Jim Jannard, who previously founded Oakley. As a self-described &quot;camera fanatic&quot; owning over 1,000 models, Jannard started the company with the intent to deliver a (relatively) affordable 4K digital cinema camera. Jannard dates the idea to a time when he bought a Sony HDR-FX1 video camera and learned that the files had to be converted with software from Lumiere HD and were not viewable on Mac OS. Lumiere HD&#x27;s owner Frederic Lumiere collaborated with Jannard on developing an alternative and introduced him to Ted Schilowitz who became Red&#x27;s first employee.

The early team members engaged in undisclosed research on how to make a digital camera feasible for Hollywood productions. Part of the process involved using 4K resolution instead of 2K which was most common at the time. Another technical hurdle was to achieve the focusing quality of DSLR cameras without sacrificing frame rate. Part of Red&#x27;s solution to this problem was developing a sensor with a physical size comparable to that of analog film. At the 2006 NAB Show, Jannard announced that Red would build a 4K digital cinema camera, called the Red One and began taking pre-orders.

In March 2007, director Peter Jackson completed a camera test of two prototype Red One cameras, which became the 12-minute World War I film &quot;Crossing the Line&quot;. On seeing the short film, director Steven Soderbergh told Jannard: &quot;I am all in. I have to shoot with this.&quot; Soderbergh took two prototype Red Ones into the jungle to shoot his film &quot;Che&quot;. A short documentary, &quot;Che and the Digital Revolution&quot;, was made about the Red camera technology that was used in the film&#x27;s production. The Red One first shipped in August 2007. One of the first television programs to shoot with it was the medical drama &quot;ER&quot;.

In 2010, Red acquired the historic Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood, and renamed it &quot;Red Studios Hollywood&quot;. By 2011, it had over 400 employees. 2011 was also the year in which Panavision, Arri, and Aaton announced that they would no longer be producing analog cameras. Red Digital Cinema and the Red One were widely credited with accelerating this transition in the industry. Schilowitz responded by saying &quot;It was never our goal to kill film. Instead, we wanted to evolve it.&quot;

In 2010, 5% of the top 100 grossing domestic films that were shot on digital video used Red cameras as their primary system. Their share increased to over 25% by 2016, but has declined since then.

On August 19, 2013, Jim Jannard announced his retirement from Red, leaving Jarred Land as president.

On March 7, 2024, Red Digital Cinema accepted a takeover of the company by Japanese camera equipment manufacturer Nikon Corporation for an undisclosed amount; this may be part of a growing interest of Nikon to expand into the digital cinema camera market. On April 12, 2024, Nikon announced that it had acquired 100% of the outstanding membership interests of Red Digital Cinema. Keiji Oishi, of Nikon&#x27;s imaging business unit, assumed the role of CEO and Tommy Rios, the executive vice president of Red Digital Cinema, became co-CEO. Red&#x27;s former president, Jarred Land, and James Jannard, Red&#x27;s founder, remain as close advisors to the company.

On May 9, 2024, Nikon Corporation released their financial results report of the year ended March 31, 2024 and disclosed the amount paid, reported as &quot;the deal of the century&quot; in the camera industry: 13,167 million yen, approximately $87 million US dollars (the currency exchange rate on April 8, 2024), which represents 1-2% within the Nikon Group Companies.

==Cameras==

===Red One===
The Red One first introduced in 2007 was Red Digital Cinema&#x27;s first production camera. It captures up to 120 frames per second at 2K resolution and 60 frames per second at 4K resolution. Its &quot;Mysterium&quot; sensor was acquisitioned for use with the proprietary RAW format called Redcode. By 2010, Red began selling upgrades to a 14 megapixel sensor called the &quot;M-X&quot;. The Red One has been reviewed as having effectively the same quality as 35 mm film. The Red One was made out of aluminum alloy, and the body alone weighs .

It was used to shoot &quot;Che&quot;, &quot;The Informant&quot;, and &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;. In 2010, Red released the Red Epic, which was used to shoot &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;Prometheus&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot; and &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; as well as many other feature films.

===DSMC system===
In 2009, Red began releasing new cameras with an updated form factor compared to the Red One. Designed with the goal of facilitating either still images or video, depending on the mounting setup, Red called the concept DSMC for &quot;Digital Stills and Motion Capture&quot;. The first camera released for this system was Epic-X, a professional digital stills and motion capture camera with interchangeable lens mounts. After this a new camera line called Scarlet was introduced that provided lower end specifications at a more affordable price. Initially equipped with a 5K imaging sensor, upgrades were later offered to a 6K sensor with higher dynamic range called the &quot;&quot;.

===DSMC2 system===

The DSMC2 family of cameras was introduced in 2015 as the new form factor for all cameras up to 2020. The Weapon 8K VV and Weapon 6K were the first two cameras announced within this line. They were followed by the Red Raven 4.5K and Scarlet-W 5K. Third-party capture formats, namely Apple ProRes and Avid DNxHD, were made available for these cameras.

In 2016, an 8K sensor called &quot;Helium&quot; was introduced with the two cameras Red Epic-W and Weapon 8K S35. In early January 2017, this was given the highest sensor score ever, 108, by the DxOMark website. Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot; was the first film to be released that was shot on the Weapon. The film was shot at the camera&#x27;s full 8K resolution, and featured an equivalent workflow, supplanting director David Fincher&#x27;s &quot;Gone Girl&quot; as the film with the highest-resolution post-production workflow.

=== DSMC3 System ===
In 2019, Jared Land from Red announced the Red Komodo camera. In 2020, Red started to ship the &quot;beta&quot; stormtrooper white models of the Red Komodo to customers on the waitlist. The price for the beta cameras is $6,995, with the regular black shipping models for $5,995 (body only). The Komodo camera features 6K video, super 35 sensor, a Canon RF lens mount, a dual BP battery plate, and a global shutter.

In 2021, Red announced the Red V-Raptor camera, the current flagship model in Red&#x27;s lineup of cameras, and the first camera that officially belongs to the DSMC3 family of cameras. Like the Komodo, the Red V-Raptor also has an active Canon RF lens mount, but unlike the Komodo, the V-Raptor is capable of multi-format recording.

The V-Raptor features a VistaVision 8K sensor (40.96mm x 21.60mm) with the ability to crop to smaller formats like Super35. It is capable of recording full sensor 8K at 120FPS (or 150FPS cropped to 2.4:1), and high frame rates of up to 600FPS in 2K. With an advertised dynamic range of 17 stops. It was launched with a price tag of $24,500 (body only). Red would later release the V-Raptor XL in 2022, featuring a larger body with an expanded range of ports, internal ND filter, additional aux power, interchangeable lens mount, among other features.

In November 2022, Red announced the V-Raptor Rhino, a limited edition version of the V-Raptor, but featuring an 8K Super35 sensor and a light grey color scheme. It was launched with a price tag of $19,500. In March 2023, the V-Raptor and V-Raptor XL S35 was launched. These cameras were identical to the previous V-Raptor and XL models and, like the V-Raptor Rhino, have Super35 sensors instead of the original VistaVision sensor.


==Other products==
===Lenses===

Red has offered S35 PL mount prime and zoom lenses for their cameras.

=== Hydrogen One modular smartphone system ===
In 2017, Red announced their intentions to enter the smartphone market including planned features such as a 5.7&quot; holographic display and integration with existing camera products. On May 18, 2018, Red announced the Hydrogen One, with a release date in August 2018. Promised features included a holographic display, spatial sound, compatibility with the Red camera program, the launch of a streaming service, and modular add-ons similar to the &quot;Moto Mods&quot; feature of Motorola&#x27;s Moto Z. Especially the announced camera sensor module received attention, with Red founder Jannard claiming: &quot;If you were shooting an 8K Weapon on set as your A camera, this could certainly be your B camera.&quot;

On release, the smartphone was a critical disappointment and was even cited as a contender for the worst technology product of 2018, arising from outdated hardware and a lack of capabilities. Similarly, the phone was a commercial flop, and in 2019, promised modular add-ons vanished from Red&#x27;s website, with Jannard announcing the company was &quot;currently in the middle of radically changing the Hydrogen program&quot;. In late 2019, the company discontinued the product line.

=== Software ===
Red began selling its Redcine-X package for post-production workflow in 2009. The process of decompressing the sensor data can be sped up with a Red Rocket accelerator card. There is a downloadable SDK for working directly with the Redcode images, and another for controlling the cameras remotely.

===Redray===
Announced in 2012, the Redray Player was the first stand-alone device capable of providing 4K content to compatible 2D or 3D displays. Using a 1TB internal drive for storage, the Redray plays 4K or HD media in the Redcode format. The player uses 12-bit 4:2:2 precision. A cinema laser projector in the same family was also announced in 2012 but never released.

==Lawsuits==
On August 18, 2008, Red filed a lawsuit against the electronics company LG over its use of the name &quot;Scarlet&quot;. Red accused LG &quot;of taking the &#x27;Scarlet&#x27; brand name from the camera company&quot; after Red had denied LG&#x27;s request to use it.

On September 23, 2011, Jannard announced that his personal email account was compromised by former Arri executive Michael Bravin. A lawsuit against Arri and Bravin was filed at the end of 2011; it was settled and dismissed in 2013.

On June 27, 2012, Red sued Wooden Camera, a manufacturer of third party accessories, for patent infringement.

In February 2013, Red filed for an injunction against Sony, claiming that several of its new CineAlta products, particularly the 4K-capable F65, infringed on patents the company held. They requested that Sony not only be forced to stop selling the cameras, but that they be destroyed as well. Sony filed a countersuit against Red in April 2013, alleging that Red&#x27;s entire product line infringed on Sony patents. In July 2013, both parties filed jointly for dismissal, and as of July 20, 2013, the case is closed.

On March 2, 2017, Red filed a lawsuit against the maker of JinniMag, a third party copy of the Red Mini Mag. Videos posted on the Jinni.Tech YouTube channel have accused Red Digital Cinema Cameras of lying to their customers and possibly obtaining their patents by deceiving the USPTO.

In May 2019, Apple Inc. filed a lawsuit against Red.com, LLC over several patents relating to digital cinema cameras and sensor processing. Apple lost the case in November 2019. Apple argued that the patents related to Redcode Raw were &quot;unpatentable&quot;, but a judge ruled that Apple&#x27;s legal team had not provided sufficient evidence to back up their claims.

Red&#x27;s RAW video patent that has resulted in multiple companies being sued by Red is US8872933. This US patent is scheduled to expire on April 11, 2028.

<text>Alvah August “Al” Keller (April 11, 1920 in Alexander, New York – November 19, 1961 in Phoenix, Arizona) was an American racecar driver.

==NASCAR==
Keller participated in the NASCAR Strictly Stock/Grand National series from 1949 to 1956 with 29 career starts. He won two races during the 1954 season and was the first driver in the history of NASCAR&#x27;s top division to have won a race in a foreign-built car. Keller won the 1954 Grand National road-race at the Linden Airport in New Jersey, driving a Jaguar owned by big band leader Paul Whiteman. He also won by a two-lap margin at Oglethorpe Speedway in 1954.

==IndyCar==
In 1954 Keller began a transition to Championship Cars. He drove in the AAA and USAC Champ Car series, racing in the 1954-1959 and 1961 seasons with 32 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 six times. He was involved in the crash that killed Bill Vukovich in 1955. He finished in the top ten 13 times, with a best finish of 2nd two times (Atlanta in 1956, and Milwaukee in 1961). His best Indy 500 finish was 5th in 1961.

==Death==
Keller died as a result of injuries sustained in a Champ Car crash at the Arizona State Fairgrounds track.

<text>Safe-cracking is the process of opening a safe without either the combination or the key.

==Physical methods==
Safes have widely different designs, construction methods, and locking mechanisms. A safe cracker needs to know the specifics of whichever will come into play.

=== Lock manipulation ===
Lock manipulation is a damage-free, combination-based method. A well known surreptitious bypass technique, it requires knowledge of the device and well developed touch, along with the senses of sight and possibly sound.

While manipulation of combination locks is usually performed on Group 2 locks, many Group 1 locks are also susceptible. The goal is to successfully obtain the combination one number at a time. Manipulation procedures vary, but all rely on exploiting mechanical imperfections in the lock to open it, and, if desired, recover its combination for future use. Similar damage-free bypass can also be achieved by using a computerized auto-dialer or manipulation robot in a so-called brute-force attack. These auto-dialer machines may take 24 hours or more to reach the correct combination, although modern devices with advanced software may do so faster.

Mechanical safe locks are manipulated primarily by feel and vision, with sound sometimes supplementing the process. To find the combination the operator uses the lock against itself by measuring internal movements with the dial numbers. More sophisticated locks use advanced mechanics to reduce any feedback available to a technician in identifying a combination. These group 1
 locks were developed in response to group 2 lock manipulation. Wheels made from lightweight materials will reduce valuable sensory feedback, but are mainly used for improved resistance against radiographic attacks. Manipulation is often the preferred choice in lost-combination lockouts, since it requires no repairs or damage, but can be time consuming for an operator, with the specific difficulty depending on the unique wheel shapes and where the gates rest in relation to them. A novice&#x27;s opening time will be governed by these random inconsistencies, while some leading champions of this art show consistency. There are also a number of tools on the market to assist safe engineers in manipulating a combination lock open in the field.

Nearly all combination locks allow some &quot;slop&quot;, or deviation, while entering a combination on the dial. On average, 1% radial rotation in either direction from the center of the true combination number allows the fence to fall despite slight deviation, so that for a given safe, it may be necessary only to try a subset of possible combinations. Such &quot;slops&quot; may allow for a margin of error of plus or minus two digits, which means that trying multiples of five would be sufficient in this case. This drastically reduces the time required to exhaust the number of meaningful combinations. A further reduction in solving time is obtained by trying all possible settings for the last wheel for a given setting of the first wheels before nudging the next-to-last wheel to its next meaningful setting, instead of zeroing the lock each time with a number of turns in one direction.

=== Guessing the combination ===

A safe may be compromised by using a manufacturer-set combination. Known as try-out combinations, these allow an owner initial access to their safe in order to set a new unique one. Sources of
try-out combinations exist by manufacturer.

Other easy-to-guess combinations include a birthdate, street address, or driver&#x27;s license number.

=== Autodialer ===
Autodialing machines have been developed to open safes. Unlike fictional machines that can open any combination in a matter of seconds, such machines are usually specific to a particular type of lock and must cycle through thousands of combinations before success. Such a device was created by two students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which took 21,000 tries to open a Sargent and Greenleaf 8500 lock on a Diebold Safe. Lockmasters, Inc. markets the QX3 Combi Autodialer (LKMCOMBI) that works on a variety of 3 and 4 Wheel combination safe locks.

Another computer-aided method uses tools similar to autodialers, which instead make measurements of the internal components of the lock then deduce the combination in a way similar to that of a human safe cracker. Mas Hamilton&#x27;s SoftDrill was one such device, but is no longer in production.

=== Weak-point drilling ===
Some safes are susceptible to compromise by drilling. Manufacturers publish tightly-guarded drill-point diagrams for locksmiths for specific models. Drilling is an aid in bypassing the locking mechanism, as well as gaining more information about it in order to defeat it. It is the most common method used by locksmiths on malfunctioning or damaged locks, and commonly used in burglary.

Drill-points are often located close to the axis of the dial on the combination lock, but drilling for observation may sometimes require drilling through the top, sides or rear of the safe. While observing the lock, the attacker manipulates the dial to align the lock gates so that the fence falls and the bolt is disengaged.

Bypass attacks involve physical manipulation of both the lock and its bolt mechanism.

Punching, peeling and using a torch are other methods of compromising a safe. The punch system is widely used by criminals for rapid entry. Punching was developed by Pavle Stanimirovic and used in New York City. Peeling is a method that involves removing the outer skin of the safe.

All quality safes protect against drilling attacks through the strategic use of specially tempered or alloyed hardplate steel, or composite hardplate (casting tungsten carbide chips into alloys such as cobalt-vanadium, designed to shatter the cutting tips of a drill bit). These include protecting the locking mechanism, the bolts, and areas where drilling could be used to advantage. Special diamond or tungsten-carbide drill-bits can make some headway with some hardplates, but it is still a time-consuming and difficult process.

Some high-security safes use a tempered glass relocker. This has wires that lead from the glass to randomly located, spring-loaded bolts. If a penetrating drill or torch breaks the glass, the bolts are released, blocking retraction of the main locking bolts. A gas abrasive drill can sometimes be used to safely drill through a glass relocker.

Plasma cutters and thermal lances can be as hot as , much hotter than traditional oxyacetylene torches, and can be used to burn through the metal on a safe. Many modern high-security safes also incorporate additional thermal safeties to foil blow torches and thermal lances. These are usually in the form of fusible links integrated into the glass relocker cabling, which trigger it when a set temperature is exceeded.

Drilling is an attractive method of safecracking for locksmiths, as it is usually quicker than manipulation, and drilled safes can generally be repaired and returned to service.

=== Scoping ===
Scoping a safe is the process of drilling a hole and inserting a borescope into the safe to get an intimate look into a specific part of the security container. When manipulation-proof mechanical locks and glass re-lockers are implemented as security measures, scoping is the most practical option. One common method is called &quot;scoping the change key hole.&quot; The safecracker will drill a hole allowing him to get his scope into a position to observe the change key hole. While spinning the dial and looking through the change key hole for certain landmarks on the combination lock&#x27;s wheel pack, it is possible to obtain the combination and then dial open the safe with the correct combination. This method is common for a professional safe specialist because it leaves the lock in good working order and only simple repairs are needed to bring the safe barrier back to its original condition. It is also a common way to bypass difficult hard plates and glass re-lockers since the change key hole can be scoped by drilling the top, side, or back of the container.

=== Brute force methods ===
Other methods of cracking a safe generally involve damaging the safe so that it is no longer functional. These methods may involve explosives or other devices to inflict severe force and damage the safe so it may be opened. Examples of penetration tools include acetylene torches, drills, and thermal lances. This method requires care as the contents of the safe may be damaged. Safe-crackers can use what are known as jam shots to blow off the safe&#x27;s doors.

Most modern safes are fitted with &#x27;relockers&#x27; (like the one described above) which are triggered by excessive force and will then lock the safe semi-permanently (a safe whose relocker has tripped must then be forced, as the combination or key alone will no longer suffice). This is why a professional safe-technician will use manipulation rather than brute force to open a safe so they do not risk releasing the relocker.

=== Radiological methods ===

Penetrating radiation such as X-ray radiation can be used to reveal the internal angular relationship of the wheels gates to the flys mechanism to deduce the combination. Some modern safe locks are made of lightweight materials such as nylon to inhibit this technique, since most safe exteriors are made of much denser metals. The Chubb Manifoil Mk4 combination lock contains a lead shield surrounding part of the lock to defeat such attempts to read its wheels.

=== Tunneling into bank vaults ===

Large bank vaults which are often located underground have been compromised by safe-crackers who have tunneled in using digging equipment. This method of safe-cracking has been countered by building patrol-passages around the underground vaults. These patrol-passages allow early detection of any attempts to tunnel into a vault.

=== Safe bouncing ===

A number of inexpensive safes sold to households for under $100 use mechanical locking mechanisms that are vulnerable to bouncing. Many cheap safes use a magnetic locking pin to prevent lateral movement of an internal locking bolt, and use a solenoid to move the pin when the correct code is entered. This pin can also be moved by the impact of the safe being dropped or struck while on its side, which allows the safe to be opened. One security researcher taught his three-year-old son how to open most consumer gun safes. More expensive safes use a gear mechanism that is less susceptible to mechanical attacks.

=== Magnet risk === 
Low-end home and hotel safes often utilize a solenoid as the locking device and can often be
opened using a powerful rare-earth magnet.

==Electronic methods==
Electronic locks are not vulnerable to traditional manipulation techniques (except for brute-force entry). These locks are often compromised through power analysis attacks. Several tools exist that can automatically retrieve or reset the combination of an electronic lock; notably, the Little Black Box and Phoenix. Tools like these are often connected to wires in the lock that can be accessed without causing damage to the lock or container. Nearly all high-end, consumer-grade electronic locks are vulnerable to some form of electronic attack.

=== TEMPEST ===
The combinations for some electronic locks can be retrieved by examining electromagnetic emissions coming from the lock. Because of this, many safe locks used to protect critical infrastructure are tested and certified to resist TEMPEST attacks. These include the Kaba Mas X-10 and S&amp;G 2740B, which are FF-L-2740B compliant.

=== Spiking the lock ===
Low-end electronic fire-safes, such as those used in hotels or for home use, are locked with either a small motor
or a solenoid. If the wires running to the device (solenoid or motor) can be accessed, the device can be &#x27;spiked&#x27;
with a voltage from an external source - typically a 9 volt battery - to open the container.

== Keypad-based attacks ==
If an electronic lock accepts user input from a keypad, this process can be observed in order to reveal the combination. Common attacks include:

* Visually observing a user enter the combination (shoulder surfing)
* Hiding a camera in the room which records the user pressing keys
* Examining fingerprints left on the keys
* Placing certain gels, powders, or substances on the keys that can be smudged or transferred between keys when the combination is entered, and observed at a later time.
* Placing a &quot;skimmer&quot; (akin to those used for credit card fraud) behind the keypad to record the digital signals that are sent to the lock body when the combination is entered.
* Examining wear or deformity of buttons which are pressed more often than others

Many of these techniques require the attacker to tamper with the keypad, wait for the unsuspecting user to enter the combination, and return at a later time to retrieve the information. These techniques are sometimes used by members of intelligence or law enforcement agencies, as they are often effective and surreptitious.

=== High-security keypads ===
Some keypads are designed to inhibit the aforementioned attacks. This is usually accomplished by restricting the viewing angle of the keypad (either by using a mechanical shroud or special buttons), or randomizing the positions of the buttons each time a combination is entered.

Some keypads use small LED or LCD displays inside of the buttons to allow the number on each button to change. This allows for randomization of the button positions, which is normally performed each time the keypad is powered on. The buttons usually contain a lenticular screen in front of the display, which inhibits off-axis viewing of the numbers.

When properly implemented, these keypads make the &quot;shoulder surfing&quot; attack infeasible, as the combination bears no resemblance to the positions of the keys which are pressed.

While these keypads can be used on safes and vaults, this practice is uncommon.

==Media depictions==
Movies often depict a safe-cracker determining the combination of a safe lock using his fingers or a sensitive listening device to determine the combination of a rotary combination lock. Other films also depict an elaborate scheme of explosives and other devices to open safes.

Three safecracking methods seen in movies were also tested on the television show &quot;MythBusters&quot;, with some success. While the team was able to blow the door off of a safe by filling the safe with water and detonating an explosive inside it, the contents of the safe were destroyed and filling the safe with water required sealing it from the inside. The safe had also sprung many leaks.

<doc id="1251896" wikidata="Q5506230" url="?curid=1251896" title="Frosty (frozen dairy dessert)">
<text>The Frosty is a frozen dairy dessert of the American fast-food restaurant chain Wendy&#x27;s. The Frosty was among the first five items introduced on the Wendy&#x27;s menu.

Wendy&#x27;s founder Dave Thomas created the original &quot;light chocolate&quot; Frosty himself by combining chocolate and vanilla flavors, as he thought that a pure chocolate flavor would overwhelm the taste of the restaurant&#x27;s hamburgers. Thomas based the Frosty on the milkshakes he drank in Detroit as a youth, and created the Frosty to be thick enough to require a spoon to eat. The consistency has been described as between that of a milkshake and soft-serve ice cream.

==Specialty flavors==
Over the years Wendy&#x27;s has occasionally introduced new Frosty flavor variations.

In August 2006, a vanilla Frosty flavor was introduced after repeated customer requests.

For both Summer 2022 and Summer 2023, the vanilla Frosty was temporarily replaced with a strawberry Frosty.

In November 2022, Wendy&#x27;s released the new peppermint Frosty for the holidays; this was the third new Frosty flavor released and temporarily replaced the vanilla Frosty.

In September 2023, a pumpkin spice Frosty was introduced.

For Winter 2024, the vanilla Frosty was reintroduced after having been continuously supplanted by other flavors for a two-year period. Wendy&#x27;s generally swaps out the vanilla Frosty flavor whenever a specialty Frosty flavor is launched, while always keeping the original signature chocolate Frosty flavor available. 

For Spring 2024, an orange dreamsicle Frosty was introduced.

For Summer 2024, a triple berry Frosty was introduced.

In fall 2024, a &quot;pineapple under the sea&quot; Frosty was released in honor of the 25th anniversary of SpongeBob SquarePants. This was followed by a &quot;salted caramel&quot; frosty in November. 

In February 2025, Wendy&#x27;s launched a new seasonal Frosty flavor named Thin Mints Frosty. It is a collaboration of Wendy&#x27;s with Girl Scouts which results in the creation of this delicious Frosty in Girl Scouts Thin Mints Cookies flavor.

<text>Mary Frances Berry (born February 17, 1938) is an American historian, writer, lawyer, activist and professor who focuses on U.S. constitutional and legal, African-American history. Berry is the Geraldine R. Segal Professor of American Social Thought where she teaches American legal history at the Department of History, School of Arts &amp; Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the former chairwoman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. Previously, Berry was provost of the College of Behavioral and Social Science at University of Maryland, College Park, and was the first African American chancellor of the University of Colorado at Boulder.

==Early life and education==
Berry was born in Nashville, Tennessee, the second of the three children of George Ford and Frances Berry (née Southall). Because of economic hardship and family circumstances, she and her older brother were placed in an orphanage for a time.

Berry attended Nashville&#x27;s segregated schools. In 1956, she graduated with honors from Pearl High School. She attended Fisk University in Nashville, where her primary interests were philosophy, history, and chemistry. Berry transferred to Howard University, where in 1961 she received her B.A. In 1962, she received her M.A. from Howard. In 1966, Berry received a Ph.D. in American constitutional history from the University of Michigan. In 1970, she earned a J.D. from the University of Michigan Law School.

==Career==
Berry spent seven years working at the University of Maryland, eventually becoming interim provost of the Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences. In 1976, she became chancellor of the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, the first black woman to head a major research university.

In 1977, Berry took a leave of absence from the University of Colorado when President Jimmy Carter named her assistant secretary for education in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

In 1980, Berry left the Department of Education to return to Howard University as a professor of history and law. Carter appointed her to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, where during her tenure she became involved in legal battles with Carter&#x27;s successor, Ronald Reagan. When Reagan attempted to remove her from the board, she successfully went to court to keep her seat. She clashed frequently on the commission with the Reagan-appointed chairman, Clarence M. Pendleton Jr. Pendleton tried to move the commission in line with Reagan&#x27;s social and civil rights views and aroused the ire of liberals and feminists. He served from 1981 until his sudden death in 1988. 
In 1984, Berry co-founded the Free South Africa Movement, dedicated to the abolition of apartheid in South Africa. She was one of three prominent Americans arrested at the South African Embassy in Washington the day before Thanksgiving; the timing was deliberate to ensure maximum news exposure.

In 1987, Berry took a tenured chair at the University of Pennsylvania, while continuing to serve on the Civil Rights Commission.

In 1993, Berry&#x27;s book &quot;The Politics of Parenthood: Child Care, Women&#x27;s Rights, and the Myth of the Good Mother&quot; was published. Reviewing the book in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, Laura Van Tuyl stated, &quot;Berry presents a dispassionate history of the women&#x27;s movement, day care, and home life, showing the persistent obstacles to economic and political power that have confronted women as a result of society&#x27;s definition of them as &#x27;mothers.&#x27; Her heavily footnoted chronology attributes the failure of the Equal Rights Amendment, the languishing of the women&#x27;s movement in the &#x27;80s, and years of bickering over federal parental-leave and child care bills to an unwillingness to rethink gender roles.&quot; In 1993, Berry was also appointed chair of the Civil Rights Commission by President Bill Clinton, who reappointed her for another term in 1999.

Separately from her work on the Civil Rights Commission, Berry was named chair of the Pacifica Radio Foundation&#x27;s National Board in June 1997. She drew controversy from listeners, programmers, and station staff, after she and the board attempted to modify programming in order to expand the listeners of the stations and to attract a more diverse audience. &quot;White male hippies over 50,&quot; is how Berry described the programmers and audience of KPFA in Berkeley. Rumors of board actions involving the sale of flagship stations such as KPFA were widely circulated by the programmers. (Unlike most public service stations, Pacifica stations hold valuable high wattage licenses at commercial frequencies in major urban markets including New York City.) In 1999 she and Pacifica&#x27;s Executive Director Lynn Chadwick fired the station&#x27;s manager and issued a gag order, threatening to fire anyone else who worked at the station who spoke of their actions. Berry thereafter ordered a lockout of all KPFA personnel, in violation of station union agreements. She then proceeded to demand the imposition of racial preferences across the board at KPFA, though she refused to meet with minority staff people at the station, who mostly disagreed with her actions. Berry&#x27;s actions in connection with Pacifica Radio brought protest from free speech groups such as the ACLU. She subsequently resigned from the Pacifica board.

She continued to serve as chair of the Civil Rights Commission. In 1999, Berry persuaded the Clinton administration to appoint Victoria Wilson, her editor at Alfred A. Knopf, to the commission. In 2001, she and the Democratic board members of the commission barred the seating of Peter Kirsanow, who had been appointed by President George W. Bush to replace Wilson on the commission. Berry and the Democratic bloc argued that Wilson was entitled to serve a full six-year term, but the Bush Administration contended that she had only been appointed to serve out the remainder of a previous member&#x27;s term. Kirsanow sued, claiming Wilson&#x27;s tenure had expired and he had been validly appointed. Wilson won in federal district court but ultimately lost on appeal in 2002, and the court ordered the seating of Kirsanow. The dispute determined which political party would have a majority of the board&#x27;s members. Berry left office expiration of her term in late 2004 and was succeeded by Gerald A. Reynolds.

In 2009, Berry&#x27;s ninth book was published, a history of the Civil Rights Commission. Reviewing it in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Samuel G. Freedman wrote, &quot;Reviewing a book is not reviewing a life. For her public service on behalf of racial justice, Mary Frances Berry deserves her many accolades. But on the evidence of &#x27;And Justice for All,&#x27; she may have been the wrong person to tell a story that obviously matters to her so deeply.&quot;

<text>Juan Guilloto León, usually referred to as Modesto or Juan Modesto (24 September 1906 – 16 April 1969), was a Republican army officer during the Spanish Civil War.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born at El Puerto de Santa María in Cádiz, Juan Guilloto worked at a sawmill before joining the Spanish Army. He served in Morocco, becoming a corporal of the Regulares colonial troops based in Larache.

Juan Guilloto was affiliated with the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) from 1930, and in 1933 he was placed in charge of the &quot;Milicias Antifascistas Obreras y Campesinas&quot; (&quot;MAOC&quot;) in Madrid, which constituted a paramilitary force for the Party. He organized the &quot;Sindicato de Oficios Varios y el Socorro Rojo&quot;, which coordinated relations with the Socorro Rojo Internacional.

===Spanish Civil War===
When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936, Juan Guilloto participated in the assault of Cuartel de la Montaña, and the Battle of Guadarrama fought in the Guadarrama Mountain Range. He was one of the leaders of Fifth Regiment, becoming its commander from October 1936 onwards. He fought in Talavera de la Reina, Santa Olalla and Illescas (September 1936), the defense of Madrid and the Second battle of the Corunna Road, as well as in the Battle of Jarama (February 1937).

Juan Guilloto was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the Popular Army and commander of 5th Army Corps, participating in the battles of Belchite, Brunete (July) and Teruel (December 1937 and January 1938). On 26 August 1938, he was promoted to colonel and became head of the Army of the Ebro. 

After the fall of Catalonia to the rebel army, Negrín named Modesto general and head of the Central Army on March 2, 1939.

=== The Battles around Madrid ===
At the end of August, he moved to the province of Toledo, where he led a battalion, trying to contain the Franco advance towards Madrid. It was distinguished especially in the fights with the troops of the Army of Africa along the Tagus river during their advance towards Madrid, highlighting his interventions in Talavera, Santa Olalla, Toledo or Illescas. During the fighting in the Talavera-Santa Olalla area, he revealed himself as an authentic military chief by coordinating the actions of the militias and regular units (Guardias de asalto) under his command. In November he stood out again during the siege of Madrid and in January 1939 during the fight for Barcelona.

===Exile===

After Casado&#x27;s coup&#x27;s, on 6 March Modesto left Spain in an airplane. Then he went to the Soviet Union, whose government recognized his military rank. 

During World War II, he served with the Red Army and the Bulgarian Communist forces. Defeated in the struggle with José Díaz for control of the PCE, he went to Prague.

Modesto wrote a book about his experience during the war in the 5th Regiment, titled &quot;Soy del Quinto Regimento&quot; (English: &quot;I am of the Fifth Regiment&quot;), published in Paris in 1969. He died in Prague in 1969.
