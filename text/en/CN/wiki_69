<text>Gluma is a brand-name desensitizer, used in dentistry to treat sensitivity, product created by manufacturer Heraeus Kulzer, a German company.

==Use==
Its formula of 5% glutaraldehyde and 35% HEMA (hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate) in water is used to help control both hypersensitive dentin and reduce the incidence of post-operative sensitivity in restorative dentistry procedures. It’s also useful as a cavity disinfectant, a rewetting agent and an adhesion promoter (when combined with most dentin bonding systems).

Research indicates that when used as a desensitizer under bonded restorative material, Gluma has no significant influence on bond strength, unlike some other liners, which contribute to a decrease in bond strength. In one study, potassium nitrate was more effective at reducing sensitivity.

==Method of action==
The glutaraldehyde in Gluma works by occluding (blocking) the microscopic tubules that compose dentin, thereby preventing the flow of fluid and decreasing sensitivity.

Gluteraldehyde induces coagulation of proteins in dentinal tubules, which reacts with the serum albumin in the dentinal fluid to cause its precipitation. HEMA forms deep resinous tags and then occludes the dentinal tubules.

<text>Eric &quot;Red&quot; Erickson (1896 – January 1983) was a Swedish oil executive who worked as an operative for the Office of Strategic Services during World War 2.

==Background==
Erickson was born in 1896 in Brooklyn, New York State 
in the United States of America, the son of Swedish immigrants. After working in the oilfields of Texas, Erickson decided to get a college degree and go to work in the oil business. In order to start college and avoid the 1917 wartime draft, Erickson claimed to be seven years older than his actual age, and years later would invent a cover story that he served with the U.S. Army in World War I as an intelligence officer, although this was not true. After attending Cornell University at the suggestion of oil magnate Walter C. Teagle, Erickson graduated in 1921. After working for Standard Oil in Asia, Erickson moved to Sweden in 1924 and became a successful oil trader. During the mid-1930s, he renounced his U.S. citizenship and became a Swedish citizen.

==Espionage career==
At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Erickson continued his oil business with Nazi Germany, making millions of dollars in the process. After being placed on a wartime blacklist by the USA in 1942 for collaboration with the enemy, Erickson was disowned by his brother in America. In order to clear his name, Erickson agreed to work for the Allies, and was given the code name &#x27;Red&#x27; by U.S. intelligence. Pretending that he was a Nazi sympathizer interested in building a refinery in Sweden to process oil for Germany, Erickson visited Germany more than 30 times between 1939 and 1945 in order to spy
on German synthetic oil plants for the OSS, which used his information to provide targeting data for Allied bombing raids. During his visits he fell in love with a German woman, Anne-Maria Freudenreich, who was shot by the Gestapo at Moabit Prison in 1945.

Alexander Klein wrote a 1958 book about Erickson&#x27;s World War II exploits, &quot;The Counterfeit Traitor&quot;, which was made into a 1962 movie of the same name, starring William Holden in the role of &#x27;Red&#x27; Erickson. While mostly accurate,
the film included some invented material including Erickson&#x27;s daring escape from Germany in 1945. Erickson himself appeared on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; June 3, 1958, to publicize the book, which also included some invented material such as his killing of a Gestapo agent.

==Death==
Erickson died in Sweden in January 1983 of natural causes.

<doc id="1253481" wikidata="Q608989" url="?curid=1253481" title="Muhammed Bello">
<text>Muhammadu Bello (; ; 3 November 1781 – 25 October 1837) was the second Caliph of Sokoto and reigned from 1817 until 1837. He was also an active writer of history, poetry, and Islamic studies. He was the son and primary aide to Usman dan Fodio, the founder of the Sokoto Caliphate and the first caliph. During his reign, he encouraged the spread of Islam throughout the region, increasing education for both men and women, and the establishment of Islamic courts. He died on October 25, 1837, and was succeeded by his brother Abu Bakr Atiku and then his son, Aliyu Babba.

==Early life==

Muhammad Bello was born on 3 November 1781. His father, Usman dan Fodio, was an Islamic preacher and scholar. His mother, Hauwa, was the daughter of a Fulani Islamic scholar and a friend of his father. He was nicknamed &#x27;Bello&#x27;, meaning &#x27;assistant&#x27; or &#x27;helper&#x27; in Fulfulde. This likely due to his attachment to his father, who Bello always accompanied everywhere he went from a very young age later becoming Usman&#x27;s wazir.

He was from a Torodbe family who are partly Arabs and partly Fulani as stated by Abdullahi dan Fodio, brother of Usman dan Fodio who claimed that their family are part Fulani, and part Arabs, they claimed to descent from the Arabs through Uqba, but Bello added that he was not sure if it was Uqba ibn Nafi, Uqba ibn Yasir or Uqba ibn Amir. The Uqba in question married a Fulani woman called Bajjumangbu through which the Torodbe family of Usman dan Fodio descended. Caliph Muhammed Bello in his book Infaq al-Mansur claimed descent from Muhammad through his paternal grandmother Hawwa (mother of Usman dan Fodio), Alhaji Muhammadu Junaidu, Wazirin Sokoto, a scholar of Fulani history, restated the claims of Shaykh Abdullahi bin Fodio in respect of the Danfodio family been part Arabs and part Fulani, while Ahmadu Bello in his autobiography written after independence replicated Caliph&#x27;s Muhammadu Bello claim of descent from the Arabs through Usman Danfodio&#x27;s mother, the historical account indicates that the family of Shehu dan Fodio are partly Arabs and partly Fulani who culturally assimilated with the Hausas and can be described as Hausa-Fulani Arabs. Prior to the beginning of the 1804 Jihad the category Fulani was not important for the Torankawa (Torodbe), their literature reveals the ambivalence they had defining Torodbe-Fulani relationships. They adopted the language of the Fulbe and much ethos while maintaining a separate identity. The Toronkawa clan at first recruited members from all levels of Sūdānī society, particularly the poorer people.
Toronkawa clerics included people whose origin was Fula, Wolof, Mande, Hausa and Berber.
However, they spoke the Fula language, married into Fulbe families, and became the Fulbe scholarly caste.

Muhammed Bello was born to the fourth wife of Usman dan Fodio, known as Hauwa or Inna Garka, in 1781 Similar to all his siblings, he was involved in studies directed by his father in Degel until the family and some followers were exiled in 1804. In 1809, Bello was responsible for the founding of Sokoto which would become the key capital for his father&#x27;s conquest of Hausa lands in the Fulani War (1804-1810).

Many of his siblings dedicated significant time to scholastic efforts and became well known in this regard. Notable amongst these were his sister Nana Asma’u, a poet and teacher, and Abu Bakr Atiku, who would become his successor as Sultan.

== Sarkin Musulmi (1817–1837) ==
Following the jihad of Usman dan Fodio, the Sokoto Caliphate was one of the largest states in Africa and included large populations of both Fulani and Hausa. Usman dan Fodio tried to largely suppress Hausa systems, including traditional leadership, education, and language. Usman retired from administration of the state in 1815 and put Muhammed Bello in charge of some of the western Emirates of the Caliphate. Bello Presided over this Emirates from the city of Wurno close to Sokoto.

Upon the Death of Dan-Fodio, the Caliphate was thrown into disarray when the supporters of Bello encircled and sealed the gates of Sokoto, preventing other notable contenders to the office of Caliph ( including Bello&#x27;s uncle Abdullahi Ibn Fodio ) from entering the city. The Caliphate eventually fractured into four Self-governing parts of which only the parts ruled by Bello&#x27;s uncle; Abdullahi Ibn Fodio were to recognize and pay allegiance to Bello.

Sultan Bello faced early challenges from dissident leaders and the aristocracy of both Fulani and Hausa populations. In contrast with his father, his administration was more permissive of many Hausa systems that had existed prior to the caliphate. For Fulani populations, who had been largely pastoral prior to this point, Bello encourages permanent settlement around designed ribats with schools, mosques, fortifications, and other buildings. Although these moves ended much opposition, some dissident leaders such as &#x27;Abd al-Salam and Dan Tunku continued to cause early resistance to his rule. Dan Tunku remained a significant dissident leader as the head of the Emirate of Kazaure. Although Dan Tunku had fought on the side of his father in the Fulani War, when Bello named Ibrahim Dado the Emir of Kano in 1819, Dan Tunku organized oppositional forces in revolution. Bello assisted Ibrahim Dado in defeating the forces of Dan Tunku and building significant fortresses throughout the region where Dan Tunku had drawn his power.

After ending some early opposition, the Sultan focused on consolidating his administration throughout the empire with significant construction, settlement, and uniform systems of justice. One significant aspect that he expanded from his father was greatly expanded education of both men and women. His sister, Nana Asma’u, became a crucial part of expanding education to women becoming an important teacher and liaison to rural women to encourage education.

During Muhammad Bello&#x27;s rule, El Hadj Umar Tall, future founder of the Toucouleur empire, settled in Sokoto on his return from Mecca in 1822. Umar Tall was greatly influenced by Sultan Muhammad Bello as evidenced by the praise Tall lavished upon the Sultan in his own writings. To affirm a permanent alliance, Sultan Bello married one of his daughters to Hajj Umar who remained in Sokoto as a judge (qadi), and as a commanding officer in the Sultan&#x27;s infantry until Bello&#x27;s death.

Hugh Clapperton visited the court of Bello in 1824 and wrote a lot about the generosity and intelligence of the Sultan. Clapperton was very impressed at the writing works by Bello and his exhaustive knowledge regarding British exploration in India. In 1826, Clapperton returned for a second visit, but Bello would not let him cross the border because of warfare with the Bornu Empire and Clapperton became ill and died.

In 1836, the kingdom of Gobir revolted against Sokoto rule. Sultan Muhammed Bello gathered his forces and crushed the rebellion on 9 March 1836 at the Battle of Gawakuke.

While ruling, he continued with significant educational pursuits, mainly history and poetry. His &quot;Infaku&#x27;l Maisuri&quot; (&quot;The Wages of the Fortunate&quot;) is often considered a definitive history of the Fulani Wars and his father&#x27;s empire. He wrote hundreds of texts on history, Islamic studies, and poetry during his lifetime.

He died of natural causes, at the age of 58, on October 25, 1837, in Wurno and was succeeded by his brother Abu Bakr Atiku as Sultan.

<text>Roberto Maestas (July 9, 1938 – September 22, 2010) was an American social activist who was prominent between the 1960s and the 1990s in Seattle, Washington. Maestas was a member of the Gang of Four and one of the founders of El Centro de la Raza.

==Biography==
Maestas was born in rural New Mexico and raised by his grandparents and after working throughout the Western United States as a migrant worker eventually settled in Seattle in the 1950s. Maestas was a high school teacher at Franklin High School and then enrolled in a graduate degree program at the University of Washington in 1968. In the early 1970s he helped begin an ESL program at South Seattle College. In 1972, funding to the program was abruptly cut off which led to Maestas and a number of other activists to occupy an abandoned school building in Seattle&#x27;s Beacon Hill neighborhood which eventually became El Centro de la Raza.

==Legacy==
On April 25, 2011, the Seattle City Council voted unanimously to rename the segment of South Lander Street between 16th Avenue South and 17th Avenue South (immediately south of El Centro de la Raza) as South Roberto Maestas Festival Street.

<text>The Transmitter Stallupöner Allee, Berlin is a transmission site for medium wave 
radio broadcasts situated on the Stallupöner Allee (&quot;Stallupone Avenue&quot;) in Berlin-Charlottenburg, Germany. This transmission site was established in 1948. It uses as aerial a 130-metre-high guyed steel framework mast with triangular section, which is insulated against ground. Until 1998 there was a second insulated guyed steel framework mast on the site. It was replaced by a small freestanding steel framework tower.
The transmission power of the medium wave transmitter was reduced during the nineties from 100 kilowatts to 2.5 kilowatts.

<text>Laurel Networks was founded in 1999, and specialized in routers for telecommunications carriers. 

Funding was provided in four rounds the first two of which were:

Round 1: $12.3 million, led by New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and Rein Capital

Round 2: $60M, led by NEA, Trinity Ventures, Worldview Technology Partners and WorldCom Venture Fund

In 2005, after ultimately consuming $120M in venture capital funding, they were purchased by ECI Telecom for $88M, and formally renamed as the Data Networking Division within ECI.

Their primary product is the ST Series of service edge routers. ECI considers the router&#x27;s ability to do complicated traffic shaping, monitoring and QoS at line rate to be its primary competitive advantage.

They are located in Robinson Township in the Pittsburgh region. They began the startup initially in Sewickley, Pennsylvania.

On November 8, 2011, it was announced that the Pittsburgh office would be closed and that all employees would be laid off by September 30, 2012.

<text>Larger Than Life is the second studio album by American singer Jody Watley, released by MCA Records on March 27, 1989.

==Reception==
&quot;André Cymone remains as slickly up to the minute as ever,&quot; observed &quot;Q&quot;&#x27;s Mark Cooper, &quot;filling his enormous rhythm sound with hip-hop references… Occasionally Watley lets the pose slip and slips into a passively sensuous ballad like &#x27;Everything&#x27;, but mostly she keeps acting stroppy. Perhaps she&#x27;s annoyed at the lack of any tune to match that first hit; more likely she thinks looking angry makes her sexy.&quot;

<doc id="1253503" wikidata="Q6090631" url="?curid=1253503" title="It's Only a Game">
<text>It&#x27;s Only a Game was a sports-and-game-oriented comics panel by Charles M. Schulz, creator of &quot;Peanuts&quot;. This panel feature ran for 14 months, from November 3, 1957, to January 11, 1959. &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Game&quot; was distributed by United Feature Syndicate.

Schulz and cartoonist Jim Sasseville (who also assisted Schulz on &quot;Peanuts&quot; stories for various comic books) produced this strip which appeared in newspapers four times a week, including Sundays. Schulz created the strip and produced the first few weeks worth of strips himself; after that, while Schulz was responsible for most of the written content and rough artwork, Sasseville was brought on board to provide some of the gags and all the finished artwork, done in Schulz&#x27;s style (Schulz continued to receive sole credit for the comic). 

Despite the resemblance to the children in &quot;Peanuts&quot;, most of the characters in these cartoons were adults. The comic focused on games, which could range from card games and board games to classic &quot;sporting&quot; games, or even recreational activities. Unlike most other sports comics, the sporting activities focused on many amateur sports, like golf and ping pong.

The strip was modestly successful, although its unusual three-times-a-week publication schedule (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) may have limited its placement in many newspapers. A Sunday strip was also offered to newspapers, consisting of the three panels from earlier in the week, along with a bonus fourth panel in an elongated format. 

Given the growing popularity of &quot;Peanuts&quot; (along with his work on &quot;Young Pillars&quot;) and the resulting demands on his time, Schulz canceled the strip after 63 weeks.

<text>Endarterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the atheromatous &quot;plaque&quot; material, or blockage, in the lining of an artery constricted by the buildup of deposits. It is carried out by separating the plaque from the arterial wall.

It was first performed on a subsartorial artery in 1946 by a Portuguese surgeon, João Cid dos Santos, at the University of Lisbon. In 1951, E. J. Wylie, an American, performed it on the abdominal aorta. The first successful reconstruction of the carotid artery was performed by Carrea, Molins, and Murphy in Argentina, later in the same year.

An endarterectomy of the carotid artery in the neck is recommended to reduce the risk of stroke when the carotid artery is severely narrowed, particularly after a stroke to reduce the risk of additional strokes.

Coronary endarterectomy involves removing atheroma from the wall of blocked blood vessels (coronary) supplying the heart muscle. The concept was first introduced by Bailey in the 1950s prior to the advent of coronary artery bypass surgery to help patients with angina and coronary artery disease. It is still used today when coronary artery bypass surgery proves difficult. Livesay in Texas and Nair in Leeds have published the largest series in the world.

A femoral endarterectomy is also frequently used as a supplement to a vein bypass graft at the sites of surgical anastomosis. Pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic thromboembolic disease (CTEPH) may be amenable to pulmonary thromboendarterectomy of the pulmonary artery. This procedure was refined by Jamieson over the last two decades and his technique has become the standard worldwide.

<text>Aleixo de Abreu (; Alcáçovas do Alentejo, Portugal, 1568–Lisbon, Portugal, 1630) was a Portuguese physician and tropical pathologist.

He graduated in Medicine from the University of Coimbra. Due to his notable work as a physician, he was sent to Angola, along with Afonso Furtado de Mendonça, to study the maladies, believed to be endogenous to that land, that seemed to be afflicting the Portuguese sailors.

Having spent 9 years in Angola, Aleixo de Abreu became a recognized expert in the field of African maladies. He wrote extensive studies on scurvy, known at the time in Portugal as &quot;the Angola disease&quot; (), which were later included in his Treaty of the Seven Maladies (), later published in 1623.
He later on became the main chamber&#x27;s physician in king Felipe IV&#x27;s court.

<doc id="1253525" wikidata="Q2865231" url="?curid=1253525" title="Arthur Maurice Hocart">
<text>Arthur Maurice Hocart (26 April 1883, in Etterbeek, Belgium – 9 March 1939, in Cairo, Egypt) was an anthropologist best known for his eccentric and often far-seeing works on Polynesia, Melanesia, and Sri Lanka.

==Early life==
Hocart&#x27;s family had resided for several hundred years in Guernsey (one of the Channel Islands between France and England) but are traceable to Domrémy-la-Pucelle, birthplace of Joan of Arc. Both his father, James and grandfather, also James, were Protestant missionaries in Switzerland, France and Belgium. Although Arthur was born in Etterbeek, near Brussels, he maintained his British nationality, as did the rest of his family. This juxtaposition between the English and Francophone worlds captures not only Hocart&#x27;s education, but his status as an outsider to British academia. His work often seemed to predict developments in French anthropology, such as structuralism.

==From England to the South Seas==
After attending school at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, Hocart matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford in 1902. He graduated with honors in &quot;Greats&quot;, a degree combining Latin, Greek, ancient history, and philosophy. After his graduation in 1906 he spent two years studying psychology and phenomenology at the University of Berlin. With this broad and idiosyncratic training in hand, he was picked by W.H.R. Rivers to accompany him on the Percy Sladen Trust Expedition to the Solomon Islands in 1908. Their ethnographic work on &#x27;Eddystone Island&#x27; (today known by its local name of Simbo) and in nearby Roviana, stands as one of the first modern anthropological field projects, and was the inspiration behind sections of Pat Barker&#x27;s novel &quot;The Ghost Road&quot;. Some of the data from the expedition appeared in Rivers&#x27; &quot;History of Melanesian Society&quot; in 1914, but most of their work did not make it into print until 1922, when Hocart began to publish a series of articles describing the core material. Immediately after his fieldwork in the Solomon Islands, Hocart travelled further east to Fiji, where he became the headmaster of Lau Provincial School, on the island of Lakeba in the Lau archipelago. At the same time, he maintained a research affiliation with Oxford and traveled widely through western Polynesia, conducting research in Fiji, Rotuma, Wallis Island, Samoa, and Tonga. The result was roughly six years of ethnographic fieldwork that formed the basis for Hocart&#x27;s reputation today as one of the most important early ethnographers of Oceania.

==A Military man in Ceylon==
In 1914 Hocart returned to Oxford to pursue postgraduate studies in anthropology, a position that also included some teaching. However, World War I interrupted his progress and he spent the next four years in France, in army intelligence. In 1919 he mustered out of the army having reached the rank of captain. Hocart then began what was to be a long exile from British academia to a series of posts in the British Empire. After a year-long study of Sanskrit, Tamil, Pāli, and Sinhalese he moved to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to become the Archaeological Commissioner of Ceylon, where he oversaw the excavation and preservation of monumental architecture and other archaeological sites. With experience of the ancient Mediterranean, Polynesia and Melanesia, and South Asia now under his belt Hocart began publishing widely comparative studies on many topics, including that of Kingship. In 1925 Hocart suffered a bout of severe dysentery and returned to England to recover. By the late 1920s his poor health and politics within the colonial bureaucracy made Ceylon seem a poorer and poorer choice for him. He once again attempted (and failed) to obtain a position at Cambridge before finally retiring to England in 1929 on a pension.

==London to Cairo==
Beginning in 1931 Hocart served for three years as an Honorary Lecturer in Ethnology at University College London which allowed him to give classes occasionally. He applied to Cambridge once more – this time for the chair in social anthropology – but was again unsuccessful. In 1934 he moved to Cairo where he served as the Professor of Sociology, the only academic position he held in his life. Poor health dogged him and he died in 1939 after contracting an infection in the course of research in Egypt.

==A career admired==
Hocart&#x27;s professional career took place at a time when British anthropologists were moving from an emphasis on diffusion and historical reconstruction to a more &#x27;scientific&#x27; form of functionalism. Hocart&#x27;s broad training and willingness to explore a wide variety of approaches produced work that was often poorly received by colleagues who repudiated past work in order to legitimize anthropology as a hard science. Interest in his work was revived in the 1960s when authors such as Lord Raglan, Rodney Needham, and Louis Dumont returned to Hocart&#x27;s work as a source of theoretical inspiration. Today he is remembered for his ethnography of the Pacific and as an author whose work presaged the advent of structuralism.

<text>Hermann Josef Abs (15 October 1901, Bonn – 5 February 1994, Bad Soden) was a leading Nazi banker and advisor to Chancellor Adenauer. He was a member of the board of directors of Deutsche Bank from 1938 to 1945, as well as of 44 other companies, including IG Farben. As the most powerful commercial banker of the Third Reich, he was, according to economic journalist Adam LeBor, &quot;the lynchpin of the continent wide plunder&quot;. The Allies arrested him in January 1946; however, British intervention got him freed after three months, and German courts later dropped all charges.

He was chairman of Deutsche Bank, and contributed to the reconstruction of the German economy. He chaired the German credit facility that distributed the counterpart funds created by the Marshall plan. Working closely with Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, he was a leader in rebuilding heavy industry, and helped draft the investment policy for basic industries in 1952. He played a major diplomatic role in resolving the prewar German debts at the London War Debt Agreement of 1953. In 1953 he negotiated the restitution to Israel and individual Jews for the Holocaust.

== Controversies about Joest WWII role ==
In 1974, the artist Hans Haacke revealed the supposed role of Abs with the Nazi regime in a project for the exhibition Manet-PROJEKT &#x27;74&#x27; which detailed, in ten panels, the ownership history of Édouard Manet&#x27;s Bunch of Asparagus (1880). The Wallraf-Richartz Museum rejected the Haacke display.

In 1995, studies of the Deusche Bank archives by Harold James show that, while the DB helped the Nazi in different variating degrees, direct and indirectly, there has various links between Abs and anti-Nazi resistance during the war, while Abs decided not direct participate in resistance organized acts, he went to various secret meetings and such links were described as something that made James &quot;astounded&quot;.

After the war, he participated in the restitution to Israel and individual Jews for the Holocaust.

<doc id="1253541" wikidata="Q5303620" url="?curid=1253541" title="Downtown Loop (Kansas City)">
<text>The Downtown Loop (nicknamed the Alphabet Loop) is a complex layout of highways in Downtown Kansas City, Missouri involving 24 exits, four Interstate Highways, four U.S. Highways, and numerous city streets. Each exit is numbered 2 and suffixed with every letter of the alphabet except I and O (to avoid confusion with the numbers 1 and 0). The entire circumference of the loop is just over .

==Overview==
The system is nicknamed the Alphabet Loop due to all exits having letter suffixes. Alphabetically, the letter suffixes begin with A in the northwest corner of the loop and proceed forward in a clockwise direction around the loop. Eastbound on the north side of the loop (EB I-70/NB I-35) are A through G; then H through M southbound on the east side (EB I-70/SB US 71); then N through U westbound on the south side (WB I-670); and finally V through Z northbound on the west side (NB I-35 alone).

Interstate 70 enters the southeast corner of the loop and moves north forming the east and north sides of the loop and exiting in the northwest corner. Exits on I-70 range from 2A to 2M.

Interstate 35 enters the loop at its northeast corner, joining I-70 on the north side and forming the west side of the loop before exiting in the southwest corner. Exits on I-35 range from 2F to 2A while it overlaps I-70, and 2Y to 2U after I-70 exits the loop.

Interstate 29 does not enter the loop. It begins at the northeast corner and continues north, concurrent with I-35. These two leave the loop via the Christopher S. Bond Bridge and split several miles north.

Interstate 670 forms the south side of the loop. I-670 splits from I-70 in Kansas City, Kansas, crosses over I-70 and enters the loop in the southwest corner, rejoining I-70 and ending in Kansas City, Missouri in the southeast corner of the loop. I-670 is also signed as Alternate I-70.

U.S. Route 71 is a highway that enters the loop in the southeast corner and leaves the loop with I-29 and I-35 in the northeast corner.

U.S. Route 24 is a major city street which enters the loop in the northeast corner and follows I-35 and I-70 along the north side of the loop. Former US 24 now US-Bus 24 is also known as Independence Ave/Blvd and provides a street-level connection to Independence, Missouri.

U.S. Route 40 overlaps I-70 throughout the northern and eastern sections of the loop.

U.S. Route 169 enters the loop in the northwest corner from the Buck O&#x27;Neil Bridge, and joins I-70, continuing westward.

Route 9 also provides access to the loop, ending at I-70 after crossing the Heart of America Bridge from North Kansas City.

==History==
The west side of the loop was built over a scenic road called Kersey Coates Drive. It had many affluent homes, and stairs lead down from Case Park immediately to the east. When the loop was completed, the multi-lane Interstate cut further into the bluff and these homes were razed. The stairway from Case Park was cut off halfway and remains between exits 2W and 2X.

A March 2010 preliminary study of the Kansas City I-70 corridor made several innovative suggestions to relieve congestion in the downtown area. One proposal was to make the loop unidirectional, where the loop would essentially become a large roundabout. In 2022, plans were approved to construct a $160 million cap over a stretch of I-670, on the loop&#x27;s southern half. The cap is planned to be topped with a public park called South Loop Link.

==Exit list==
The following is the list of exits inside the loop in order as encountered if entering the loop from eastbound I-70.

<doc id="1253546" wikidata="Q5676669" url="?curid=1253546" title="Harvard–Yale Regatta">
<text>The Harvard–Yale Regatta or Yale-Harvard Boat Race (often abbreviated The Race) is an annual rowing race between the men&#x27;s heavyweight rowing crews of Harvard University and Yale University. First contested in 1852, it has been held annually since 1859 with exceptions during major wars fought by the United States and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Race is America&#x27;s oldest collegiate athletic competition, pre-dating The Game by 23 years. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Yale-Harvard&quot; regatta, though most official regatta programs brand it &quot;Harvard-Yale&quot;.

Originally rowed on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire, it has since moved to the Thames River, near New London, Connecticut. Although other locations for the race have included the Connecticut River at Springfield, Massachusetts, and Lake Quinsigamond at Worcester, Massachusetts, the Thames has hosted The Race on all but five occasions since 1878 and both teams have erected permanent training camps on the Thames at Gales Ferry for Yale and at Red Top for Harvard.

The race has been exclusively between Yale and Harvard except for 1897, when the race was held as part of a three-boat race with Cornell on the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, New York, where, although it lost to Cornell, Yale was deemed the winner of the Harvard-Yale race. Due to the COVID-19, there was no Yale-Harvard Regatta in 2020, the first cancellation since 1945.

==History==

On May 24, 1843, with the arrival of the shell &quot;Whitehall&quot; in New Haven, Yale University founded the first collegiate crew in the United States. A year later, Harvard founded their boat club. These boat clubs served primarily a social purpose, until Yale&#x27;s 1852 issuance of a challenge to Harvard &quot;to test the superiority of the oarsmen of the two colleges&quot;. Dr. James M. Whiton (Yale 1853 and one of the first three men to be awarded a PhD in the United States) and Joseph Mansfield Brown (Harvard 1853) were the prime movers in bringing about the race. The idea of a race was suggested by James N. Elkins, the superintendent of the Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad, during a train journey with Whiton. The first Harvard–Yale Boat Race—and the first American intercollegiate sporting event—took place on August 3, 1852. In this two-mile (3.2 km) contest, Harvard&#x27;s &quot;Oneida&quot; prevailed over Yale&#x27;s &quot;Shawmut&quot; by about two lengths, with Yale&#x27;s &quot;Undine&quot; finishing third. The first place prize was a pair of black walnut, silver-inscribed trophy oars. The trophy oars were awarded to Harvard by General Franklin Pierce who in 1853 became the 14th President of the United States of America. Today, the 1852 trophy oars are the oldest intercollegiate athletic prize in North America.

The race distance was increased to for the second rendition in 1855 and to the current in 1876. The Oxford–Cambridge Boat Race is the only longer side-by-side rowing event in the world, though slower stream makes the Yale–Harvard Race one to three minutes longer.
Originally the race was just between the varsity crews but there are now three events: the 2-mile (3.2-km) freshman race, the 3-mile (4.8-km) junior varsity race, and the 4-mile (6.4-km) varsity race. The varsity crews compete for the Sexton Cup, the junior varsity for the F. Valentine Chappell Trophy, and the freshman for the New London Cup. The Hoyt C. Pease and Robert Chappell Jr. Trophies are awarded to the team that wins the majority of the three races.

Typically the day before the freshman, junior varsity and varsity races, there is a two-mile (3.2 km) race between the spares for both crews. These &quot;combination&quot; boats are made up of second freshman boat and third varsity boat rowers (i.e. the &quot;combi&quot; or &quot;combo&quot; race). The winner of this race gets the James P. Snider Cup, as well as the right to paint its school&#x27;s colors on the &quot;rock&quot; at Bartlett&#x27;s Cove for the next day&#x27;s races.
Currently Harvard leads the varsity series at 95–55, the second varsity (JV) at 75–38, and the freshman series at 72–39–1. Yale holds the upstream course record with its time of 18:35.8 in 2015. The Crimson set the downstream—and Thames River course—mark of 18:22.4 in 1980.

==Trophies==
The Sexton Cup is presented to the winner of the varsity heavyweight race. The trophy is actually a combination of two former rowing trophies: The bottom is the original base of the Sexton Cup, with year-by-year results of race winners, while the upper portion retains the Yale and Harvard seals from the trophy which was awarded to the winner of the (now discontinued) graduate eights race.

The F. Valentine Chappell Trophy is presented to the winner of the second varsity heavyweight race. Previously used for a discontinued event in this regatta, it was redesignated in 1983 to be awarded to the victor in the junior varsity contest.

The New London Cup is presented to the winner of the freshman race. The city of New London donated this silver award in celebration of its bicentennial and it is inscribed with the Seal of the City of New London and engraved with a ship bearing &quot;Mare Liberium&quot; (Freedom of the Seas). As of 2014, both schools began boating a 3V lineup for this race, rather than an all-freshmen lineup.

The Hoyt C. Pease and Robert Chappell Jr. Trophy is presented to the crews who win two or more of the varsity, junior varsity, and freshmen races. This sterling silver bowl was donated by George Pew, Yale Class of 1958, in honor of Pease and Chappell with the inscription: &quot;Named in honor of their great contribution over four decades to the spirit and success of The Boat Race.&quot;

The James Snider Cup is awarded to the winning crew of the Combination race of the Harvard–Yale Regatta, which is held annually in New London, Connecticut. The Combination crews are typically composed of rowers from the third varsity and second freshman boats of their respective programs. Traditionally the two crews race a 2-mile (3.2-km) course the day before the Regatta, with the winning crew earning both possession of the Cup and the right to paint the large rock surface south of Bartlett&#x27;s Cove—typically the most popular viewing spot for the Regatta&#x27;s main events the next day—with their school&#x27;s colors.

The James P. Snider Cup was dedicated in honor of James P. &quot;Jamie Sniderman&quot; Snider by the Yale Heavyweight Crew Class of 2005 following the Harvard–Yale Regatta held on June 11, 2005. The cup was donated in honor of Jamie&#x27;s years of dedicated service to both the Yale Heavyweight Crew and the Yale Crew program as a whole. In 1995 and 1996 Jamie served as an assistant coach of the Yale Women&#x27;s Crew, leading the 1995 Third Varsity to a 10–4 record. After becoming an assistant with the Men&#x27;s Heavyweight squad, Jamie led the 1997 Third Varsity Crew to an undefeated season, an Eastern Sprints Gold Medal, and a victory in the Combination Race of the Harvard–Yale Regatta. Jamie&#x27;s 1999 Combination crew earned the right to paint the rock as well. Currently, Jamie serves as the assistant coach of the Women&#x27;s Program. In 2006 he led his Third Varsity Four to a third-place finish at the Eastern Sprints, and in 2007, 2008, 2009 he coached the Varsity Four to gold medals at Eastern Sprints and a sixth, sixth and third-place finish at NCAAs.

In addition to coaching Yale crews during the season, Jamie has served as caretaker of Gales Ferry, the home and training site for the Yale Men&#x27;s Heavyweight Crew during preparation for the Harvard–Yale Regatta since 1878. He has also served as Director of the Yale University Community Rowing Program since its inception in the summer of 1999. Originally established as a small pilot program, the program has since grown to include over 100 youth participants annually, providing rowing opportunities for organizations such as the National Youth Sports Program, American School for the Deaf, and the Connecticut Special Olympics.

<text>Akka Mahadevi (c. 1130–1160) was an early poet of Kannada literature and a prominent member of the Lingayatism founded in the 12th century. Her 430 &quot;vachana&quot;s (a form of spontaneous mystical poems), and the two short writings called &quot;Mantrogopya&quot; and the &quot;Yogangatrividh&quot; are considered her known contributions to Kannada literature. The term &quot;Akka&quot; (&quot;elder sister&quot; or &quot;mother&quot;) was an honorific given to her by saints such as Basavanna, Siddharama, and Allamaprabhu as an indication of her high place in the spiritual discussions held at the &quot;Anubhava Mantapa&quot;. She is regarded to be a major female figure in Kannada literature and in the history of Karnataka. She considered the god Shiva (&#x27;Chenna Mallikarjuna&#x27;) as her husband (traditionally understood as the &#x27;madhura bhava&#x27; or &#x27;madhurya&#x27; form of devotion).

== Biography ==
Akka Mahadevi was born in Udutadi, near Shivamogga in the Indian state of the Karnataka around 1130. Some scholars suggest that she was born to a couple named Nirmalshetti and Sumati, who were both devotees of Parama Shiva. Western sources claim that little is known about her life, though it has been the subject of Indian hagiographic, folk and mythological claims, based on oral tradition and her own lyrics. One of her lyrics, for instance, appears to record her experiences of leaving her place of her birth and family in order to pursue Shiva.

Tharu and Lalita also document a claim that a local Jain king named Kaushika sought to marry her, but that she rejected him, choosing instead to fulfil the claims of devotion to the deity Para Shiva. However, the medieval sources that form the basis of this account are ambiguous and inconclusive. They include a reference to one of her poems, or &quot;vachanas&quot;, in which she lays down three conditions for marrying the king, including control over the choice to spend her time in devotion or in conversation with other scholars and religious figures, rather than with the king. The medieval scholar and poet Harihara suggests in his biography of her that the marriage was purely nominal, while other accounts from Camasara suggest that the conditions were not accepted and the marriage did not occur.

Harihara&#x27;s account goes on to say that when King Kaushika violated the conditions she had laid down, Akka Mahadevi left the palace, renouncing all her possessions including clothes, to travel to Srisailam, home of the god Parama Shiva. Alternative accounts suggest that Akka Mahadevi&#x27;s act of renunciation was a response to the king&#x27;s threats after she refused his proposal. It is likely that she visited the town of Kalyana en route, where she met two other poets and prominent figures of the Lingayat movement, Allama and Basava. She is believed to have travelled, towards the end of her life, to the Srisailam mountains, where she lived as an ascetic and eventually died. A &quot;vachana&quot; attributed to Akka Mahadevi suggests that towards the end of her life King Kaushika visited her there, and sought her forgiveness.

==History==
She is considered by modern scholars to be a prominent figure in the field of female emancipation. A household name in Karnataka, she wrote that she was a woman only in name and that her mind, body, and soul belonged to Shiva. During a time of strife and political uncertainty in the 12th century, she chose spiritual enlightenment and stood by her choice. She took part in convocations of the learned such as the &quot;Anubhavamantapa&quot; in Kalyana (now Basava Kalyana) to debate philosophy and enlightenment (or Moksha, termed by her as &quot;arivu&quot;). In search for her soul mate Lord Shiva, she made animals, flowers and birds her friends and companions, rejecting family life and worldly attachment.

Akka&#x27;s pursuit of enlightenment is recorded in poems of simple language but intellectual rigour. Her poetry explores the rejection of mortal love in favour of the love of God. Her vachanas also talk about the methods that the path of enlightenment demand of the seeker, such as killing the &#x27;I&#x27;, conquering desires and the senses and so on.

Kausika belonged to the Jain community, that was wealthy and resented by the rest of the population. She rejected her life of luxury to live as a wandering poet-saint, travelling throughout the region and singing praises to her Lord Shiva. She went in search of fellow seekers or sharanas because the company of the saintly or sajjana sanga is believed to hasten learning. She found the company of such sharanas in Basavakalyana, Bidar district and composed many vachanas in praise of them. Her non-conformist ways caused consternation in the conservative society of the time: even her guru Allama Prabhu faced difficulties in including her in the gatherings at Anubhavamantapa.

An ascetic, Mahadevi is said to have refused to wear any clothing. Legend has it that due to her true love and devotion with God her whole body was protected by hair.

All the sharnas of Anubhavamantapa, especially Basavanna, Chenna Basavanna, Kinnari Bommayya, Siddharama, Allamaprabhu and Dasimayya greet her with a word &quot;Akka&quot;. In fact it is here onwards that she becomes Akka, an elderly sister. Allama shows her the further way of attaining the transcendent bliss of union with Lord Chenna Mallikarjuna. Akka leaves Kalyana with this following vachana:

In the first phase of her life she renounced worldly objects and attractions; in the second, she discarded all object-based rules and regulations. In the third phase she began her journey towards Srishila, location of the temple to Chenna Mallikarjuna and a holy place for devotees of Shiva since before the 12th century. Akka&#x27;s spiritual journey ended at Kadali, the thick forest area of Shrisaila (Srisailam) where she is supposed to have experienced union (aikya) with Chennamallikarjuna.

One of her famous vachana translates as:
Her poetry exhibits her love for Chenna Mallikarjuna, and harmony with nature and simple living.

She sang:

== Works ==
Akka Mahadevi&#x27;s works, like many other Bhakti movement poets, can be traced through the use of her &quot;ankita&quot;, or the signature name by which she addressed the figure of her devotion. In Akka Mahadevi&#x27;s case, she uses the name &quot;Chennamallikarjuna&quot; to refer to the god Shiva. The name &quot;Chennamallikarjuna&quot; can be variously translated, but the most well-known translation is by the scholar and linguist A.K. Ramanujan, who interprets it as &#x27;Lord, white as jasmine&#x27;. A more literal translationn would be &#x27;Mallika&#x27;s beautiful Arjuna&#x27;, according to Tharu and Lalita.

Based on the use of her &quot;ankita&quot;, about 350 lyric poems or &quot;vachanas&quot; are attributed to Akka Mahadevi. Her works frequently use the metaphor of an illicit, or adulterous love to describe her devotion to &quot;Chennamallikarjuna&quot; (Shiva). The lyrics show Akka Mahadevi actively seeking a relationship with &quot;Chennamallikarjuna&quot; (Shiva), and touches on themes of abandonment, carnal love and separation.

The direct and frank lyrics that Akka Mahadevi wrote have been described as embodying a &quot;radical illegitimacy&quot; that re-examines the role of women as actors with volition and will, behaving in opposition to established social institutions and mores. At times she uses strong sexual imagery to represent the union between the devotee and the object of devotion. Her works challenge common understandings of sexual identity; for instance, in one vachana she suggests that creation, or the power of the god Shiva, is masculine, while all of creation, including men, represent the feminine: &quot;I saw the haughty master, Mallikarjuna/for whom men, all men, are but women, wives&quot;. In some vachanas, she describes herself as both feminine and masculine.

Akka Mahadevi&#x27;s works, like those of many other female Bhakti poets, touch on themes of alienation: both from the material world, and from social expectations and mores concerning women. Seeing relationships with mortal men as unsatisfactory, Akka Mahadevi describes them as thorns hiding under smooth leaves, untrustworthy. About her mortal husband she says &quot;Take these husbands who die, decay - and feed them to your kitchen fires!&quot;. In another verse, she expresses the tension of being a wife and a devotee as

==Translations and legacy ==
A. K. Ramanujan first popularised the vachanas by translating them into a collection called &quot;Speaking of Siva&quot;. Postcolonial scholar Tejaswini Niranjana criticised these translations as rendering the vachanas into modern universalist poetry ready-to-consume by the West in &quot;Siting Translation&quot; (1992). Kannada translator Vanamala Vishwanatha is currently working on a new English translation, which may be published as part of the Murty Classical Library.

Akka Mahadevi continues to occupy a significant place in culture and memory, with roads and universities named after her. In 2010, a bas relief dating to the 13th century was discovered near Hospet in Karnataka, and is believed to be a depiction of Akka Mahadevi.

<text>î

The ugal is an instrument in the Indonesian gamelan orchestra. It is a bronze metallophone played one handed with a small hammer, often in a dance-like manner. There are usually ten keys, giving a maximum range spanning about two octaves. Like the gangsa and gendér, they are suspended over tuned bamboo resonators.

The ugal features mainly in gamelan gong kebyar, where it carries the central melody (&quot;pokok&quot;) of the piece. Sometimes it may give its melodic duty to the jublag, where it then takes over as the leader of a kotekan.

There is often only one ugal in the kebyar ensemble, and it is usually deeper toned. It is played by one of the leaders of the ensemble. A second, higher toned ugal is sometimes used. The ugal is taller than the other gangsa, and the player sits on a short stool, so as to allow the player to cue the ensemble visually with ease.

The instrument also has 10 keys, with a range of two octaves, and is played with a hard wooden mallet, slightly larger than the other and usually with additional ornamentations so the leader&#x27;s sometimes theatrical cues actively catch the light. Its notes are an octave lower than those of the gangsa pemadé. The ugals play a combination of gangsa parts and cues, melodic solos, and the underlying melody with flourishes. The first, front ugal cues and plays elements of the polos interlocking gangsa part (the part that plays more often on the beat), and if there is a second ugal, it plays elements of the sangsih part (gangsa notes more often off the beat).

<text>The McGarrigle Hour is the eighth studio album by Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, released on October 13, 1998.

The album was recorded at a family gathering, including Kate&#x27;s former husband Loudon Wainwright III, their son and daughter Rufus Wainwright and Martha Wainwright, Anna&#x27;s husband Dane Lanken, their son and daughter Sylvan Lanken and Lily Lanken, and Kate and Anna&#x27;s sister Jane McGarrigle.

Several of the McGarrigle sisters&#x27; friends and collaborators, including Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt, Chaim Tannenbaum, Joel Zifkin and Philippe Tatartcheff, also appear on the album.

The combo perform a mix of traditional folk tunes, pop standards and original material by the participants.

Two of the songs, &quot;Gentle Annie&quot; and &quot;Skip Rope Song&quot;, were recorded separately with Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris in Tucson, Arizona. The sisters had been invited down to Arizona in order to participate on Harris and Ronstadt&#x27;s 1999 album &#x27;Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions&#x27;. Kate &amp; Anna accepted the offer to feature on the album, but asked Harris and Ronstadt feature on their next album in exchange. Harris later also recorded several songs for the album during the normal recording sessions in Montreal.

A DVD of a live show featured most of The McGarrigle Hour was released a year after the album. Some of the songs were accompanied by video interviews of Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle discussing the songs. The DVD also contained two &#x27;Music Videos&#x27; of the songs recorded in Tucson - neither Harris nor Ronstadt was present at the live show - and a handful of songs from a 1980 concert at Teatro Expo in Montreal.

The album won the Juno Award for Roots &amp; Traditional Album of the Year - Group at the Juno Awards of 1999.

<text>Sir Siddiq Abubakar III, (15 March 1903 – 1 November 1988) was a Nigerian Muslim leader (Sarkin Musulmi). He was the 17th Sultan of Sokoto between 17 June 1938 and 1 November 1988, making him the longest-reigning Sultan.

== Life and career ==

Siddiq Abubakar III was born in Dange on 15 March 1903. Dan Mu’azu, a son of Usman Shehu, was a grandson of Mu&#x27;azu and, through him, a direct descendant of Shehu Usman Dan Fodio (1754–1817). Abubakar was the fourth-generation heir to a two-century-old throne founded by the Shehu, the leader of the Maliki school of Islam and the Qadiri branch of Sunni.

Abubakar had an Islamic education. and served as a district scribe in Dange between 1929 and 1931. In February 1931 Abubakar succeeded his uncle, Hassan Ibn Muazu, as the local authority councillor (Head of Talata Mafara) of the Sokoto Native Authority. He rapidly distinguished himself through administrative competence, skilled management of appeals from traditional courts, and his effective supervision of district and village heads, and as a result served until 1938. As a councillor he worked in Sokoto, taking part in the decision-making process of the Sokoto Native Authority and supervising the prisons and police departments. His profile rose in Sokoto as his position made him accessible to the people, but it also led to tensions with Sultan Hasan dan Mu’azu Ahmadu. When Abubakar contested the throne with other princes, such as Ahmadu Bello and Ahmadu Isa of Gobir, the favourable impressions that Sokoto residents had towards him contributed to making his ascension possible. The British were also interested in appointing a leader who had the trust of the people within the political structure of Indirect rule, so they suggested the name of Abubakar to the kingmakers. On 17 June 1938, he was crowned as the 17th Sultan (Sarkin Musulmi) of the Sokoto Caliphate.

Abubakar was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by British King George VI during the Colonial Nigerian period in 1944, and after Nigeria attained independence in 1960, he was made a Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger (GCON) by the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 1964.

Sir Abubakar was appointed to the post of Minister Without Portfolio for the Northern Regional Government in 1951, providing moral support for the new administration of regional premier Sir Ahmadu Bello and assistance with mobilizing the Northern people for the independence movement. He then continued to play a significant role in reducing tensions in the region after the coup and assassination of Premier Sir Ahmadu Bello, Sardauna of Sokoto, on 15 January 1966.

On 18 July 1974, President Moktar Ould Daddah, who was on a state visit to Nigeria, paid a visit to Sultan Sir Abubakar, a fellow Islamic scholar, and friend in the company of General Yakubu Gowon.

In 1984, when another Sokoto son, Shehu Shagari, was removed from power, Abubakar preached peace within the emirate council and in its relationship with the new administration.

== Legacy ==

Sultan Abubakar left behind 52 children, including Maccido dan Abubakar, who succeeded Sultan Ibrahim Dasuki in 1996 to become the 19th Sultan of Sokoto.

<doc id="1253591" wikidata="Q2637918" url="?curid=1253591" title="Ibn Malka al-Baghdadi">
<text>Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt Hibat Allah ibn Malkā al-Baghdādī (; c. 1080 – 1164 or 1165 CE) was an Islamic philosopher, physician and physicist of Jewish descent from Baghdad, Iraq. Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt, an older contemporary of Maimonides, was originally known by his Hebrew birth name Baruch ben Malka and was given the name of Nathanel by his pupil Isaac ben Ezra before his conversion from Judaism to Islam later in his life.

His writings include the anti-Aristotelian philosophical work &quot;Kitāb al-Muʿtabar&quot; (&quot;The Book of What Has Been Established by Personal Reflection&quot;); a philosophical commentary on the Kohelet; and the treatise &quot;On the Reason Why the Stars Are Visible at Night and Hidden in Daytime&quot;. Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt was an Aristotelian philosopher who in many respects followed Ibn Sina, but also developed his own ideas. He proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity.

His thought influenced the Illuminationist school of classical Islamic philosophy, the medieval Jewish philosopher Ibn Kammuna, and the medieval Christian philosophers Jean Buridan and Albert of Saxony.

==Life==
Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt, famed as &quot;Awḥad al-Zamān&quot; (Unique One of his Time), was born in Balad, a town on the Tigris above Mosul in modern-day Iraq. As a renowned physician, he served at the courts of the caliphs of Baghdad and the Seljuk sultans.

He converted to Islam later in his life. Abu&#x27;l Barakat does not refer to his conversion in his writings, and the historical sources give contradictory episodes of his conversion. According to the various reports, he converted either out of &quot;wounded pride&quot;, fear of the personal consequences of the death of Sultan Mahmud&#x27;s wife while under his care as a physician or fear of execution when he was taken prisoner in a battle between the armies of the caliph and that of the sultan. Ayala Eliyahu argues that the conversion was &quot;probably motivated by convenience reasons&quot;.

Isaac, the son of the Abraham Ibn Ezra and the son-in-law of Judah Halevi, was one of his pupils, to whom Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt, Jewish at the time, dictated a long philosophical commentary on Ecclesiastes, written in Arabic using the Hebrew alphabet. Isaac wrote a poem in his honour as introduction to this work.

==Philosophy==

===Experimental method===
Al-Baghdadi described an early scientific method emphasizing repeated experimentation, influenced by Ibn Sina, as follows:

===Motion===
Al-Baghdadi was a follower of the scientific and philosophical teachings of Ibn Sina. According to Alistair Cameron Crombie, al-Baghdadi

proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity.

According to Shlomo Pines, al-Baghdadi&#x27;s theory of motion was thus

the oldest negation of Aristotle&#x27;s fundamental dynamic law [namely, that a constant force produces a uniform motion], [and is thus an] anticipation in a vague fashion of the fundamental law of classical mechanics [namely, that a force applied continuously produces acceleration].

Al-Baghdadi&#x27;s theory of motion distinguished between velocity and acceleration and showed that force is proportional to acceleration rather than velocity. Abu&#x27;l-Barakat also developed Philoponus&#x27; theory of impetus, stating that the mover imparts a violent inclination (&quot;mayl qasri&quot;) on the moved and that this diminishes as the moving object distances itself from the mover.

Al-Baghdadi also suggested that motion is relative, writing that &quot;there is motion only if the relative positions of the bodies in question change.&quot; He also stated that &quot;each type of body has a characteristic velocity that reaches its maximum when its motion encounters no resistance.&quot;

===Space and time===
Al-Baghdadi criticized Aristotle&#x27;s concept of time as &quot;the measure of motion&quot; and instead redefines the concept with his own definition of time as &quot;the measure of being&quot;, thus distinguishing between space and time, and reclassifying time as a metaphysical concept rather than a physical one. The scholar Y. Tzvi Langermann writes:

In his view, there is just one time which is similar for all beings, including God. Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt also regarded space as three-dimensional and infinite.

===Psychology===
He upheld the unity of the soul, denying that there is a distinction between it and the intellect. For him, the soul&#x27;s awareness of itself is the definitive proof that the soul is independent of the body and will not perish with it. On his contributions to Islamic psychology, Langermann writes:

He wrote a critique of Aristotelian philosophy and Aristotelian physics entitled &quot;Kitab al-Mu&#x27;tabar&quot; (the title may be translated as &quot;The Book of What Has Been Established by Personal Reflection&quot;). According to Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt, Kitāb al-Muʿtabar consists in the main of critical remarks jotted down by him over the years while reading philosophical text, and published at the insistence of his friends, in the form of a philosophical work. The work &quot;presented a serious philosophical alternative to, and criticism of, Ibn Sina&quot;. He also developed concepts which resemble several modern theories in physics.

Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt also wrote a short treatise on the intellect, &quot;Kitāb Ṣaḥiḥ adillat al-naql fī māhiyyat al-ʻaql&quot; (&quot;صحيح أدلة النقل في ماهية العقل&quot;), which has been edited by Ahmad El-Tayeb.

All that we possess in the way of medical writing by Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt are a few prescriptions for remedies. These remain in manuscript and are as yet unstudied.

==Legacy==
Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt&#x27;s thought had a deep influence on Islamic philosophy but none on Jewish thought. His works were not translated into Hebrew, and he is seldom cited in Jewish philosophy, probably because of his conversion to Islam.

The famous theologian and philosopher Fakhr al-Din al-Razi was one of Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt&#x27;s eminent disciples. The influence of Al-Baghdadi&#x27;s views appears especially in Al-Razi&#x27;s chief work &quot;Al-Mabāḥith al-Mashriqiyyah&quot; (&quot;Oriental Discourses&quot;). Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt influenced certain conceptions of Suhrawardi.

<doc id="1253603" wikidata="Q11373" url="?curid=1253603" title="Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi">
<text>Abu Ma‘shar al-Balkhi, Latinized as Albumasar (also &quot;Albusar&quot;, &quot;Albuxar&quot;, &quot;Albumazar&quot;; full name &quot;Abū Maʿshar Jaʿfar ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿUmar al-Balkhī&quot; ;
10 August 787 – 9 March 886, AH 171–272), was an early Persian Muslim astrologer, thought to be the greatest astrologer of the Abbasid court in Baghdad. While he was not a major innovator, his practical manuals for training astrologers profoundly influenced Muslim intellectual history and, through translations, that of western Europe and Byzantium.

==Life==
Abū Maʿshar was a native of Balkh, a town in the Balkh province of Afghanistan, approximately 74 kilometres (46 mi) to the south of the Amu Darya, one of the main bases of support of the Abbasid revolt in the early 8th century. Its population, as was generally the case in the frontier areas of the Arab conquest of Persia, remained culturally dedicated to its Sassanian and Hellenistic heritage. He probably came to Baghdad in the early years of the caliphate of al-Maʾmūn (r. 813–833). According to al-Nadim&#x27;s (10th century), he lived on the West Side of Baghdad, near &quot;Bab Khurasan&quot;, the northeast gate of the original city on the west Bank of the Tigris.

Abū Maʿshar was a member of the third generation (after the Arab Conquest) of the Pahlavi-oriented Khurasani intellectual elite, and he defended an approach of a “most astonishing and inconsistent” eclecticism. His reputation saved him from religious persecution, although there is a report of one incident where he was whipped for his practice of astrology under the caliphate of al-Musta&#x27;in (r. 862–866).
He was a scholar of &quot;hadith&quot;, and according to biographical tradition, he only turned to astrology at the age of forty-seven (832/3).
He became involved in a bitter dispute with al-Kindi (–873), the foremost Arab philosopher of his time, who was versed in Aristotelism and Neoplatonism. It was his confrontation with al-Kindi that convinced Abū Maʿshar of the need to study “mathematics” in order to understand philosophical arguments.

His foretelling of an event that subsequently occurred earned him a lashing ordered by the displeased Caliph al-Musta&#x27;in. &quot;I hit the mark and I was severely punished.&quot;

Al-Nadim includes an extract from Abū Maʿshar&#x27;s book on the variations of astronomical tables, which describes how the Persian kings gathered the best writing materials in the world to preserve their books on the sciences and deposited them in the Sarwayh fortress in the city of Jayy in Isfahan. The depository continued to exist at the time al-Nadim wrote in the 10th century.

Amir Khusrav mentions that Abū Maʿshar came to Benaras (Varanasi) and studied astronomy there for ten years.

Abū Maʿshar is said to have died at the age of 98 (but a centenarian according to the Islamic year count) in Wāsiṭ in eastern Iraq, during the last two nights of Ramadan of AH 272 (9 March 866). 
Abū Maʿshar was a Persian nationalist, studying Sassanid-era astrology in his &quot;Kitab al-Qeranat&quot; to predict the imminent collapse of Arab rule and the restoration of Iranian rule.

==Works==

=== Science of astrology ===
His work &quot;Kitāb al-madkhal al-kabīr&quot; (English: &quot;The Great Introduction to the Science of Astrology)&quot; provides an introduction to astrology which received many translations to Latin and Greek starting from the 11th-century.

In one part of this book he records the rising of tides in relation with the position of the Moon, noticing that there are two high-tides in a day. He rejected Greek thought that moonlight influenced the tides and considered that the Moon had some astrological virtue that attracted the sea. These ideas were discussed by European medieval scholars. It had significant influence on European medieval scholars, like Albert the Great who developed his own theory of tides based on a mix of both light and Abu Ma&#x27;shar virtue.

=== Other work ===
His works on astronomy are not extant, but information can still be gleaned from summaries found in the works of later astronomers or from his astrology works.
* &quot;Kitāb mukhtaṣar al-madkhal&quot;, an abridged version of the above, later translated to Latin by Adelard of Bath.
* &quot;Kitāb al-milal wa-ʾl-duwal&quot; (&quot;Book on religions and dynasties&quot;), probably his most important work, commented on in the major works of Roger Bacon, Pierre d&#x27;Ailly, and Pico della Mirandola.
* &quot;Fī dhikr ma tadullu ʿalayhi al-ashkhāṣ al-ʿulwiyya&quot; (&quot;On the indications of the celestial objects&quot;),
* &quot;Kitāb al-dalālāt ʿalā al-ittiṣālāt wa-qirānāt al-kawākib&quot; (&quot;Book of the indications of the planetary conjunctions&quot;),
* &quot;Kitāb al-ulūf&quot; (&quot;Book of thousands&quot;), preserved only in summaries by Sijzī.
* &quot;Kitāb taḥāwīl sinī al-ʿālam&quot; (&quot;Flowers of Abu Ma&#x27;shar&quot;), uses horoscopes to examine months and days of the year. It was a manual for astrologers. It was translated in the 12th century by John of Seville.
* &quot;Kitāb taḥāwil sinī al-mawālīd&quot; (&quot;Book of the revolutions of the years of nativities&quot;). translated into Greek in 1000, and from that translation into Latin in the 13th century.
* &quot;Kitāb mawālīd al-rijāl wa-ʾl-nisāʾ&quot; (&quot;Book of nativities of men and women&quot;), which was widely circulated in the Islamic world. ʻAbd al-Ḥasan Iṣfāhānī copied excerpts into the 14th century illustrated manuscript the Kitab al-Bulhan (ca.1390).

===Latin and Greek translations===
Albumasar&#x27;s &quot;Introduction&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-mudkhal al-kabīr&quot;, written ) was first translated into Latin by John of Seville in 1133, as &quot;Introductorium in Astronomiam&quot;, and again, less literally and abridged, as &quot;De magnis coniunctionibus&quot;, by Herman of Carinthia in 1140.
Lemay (1962) argued that the writings of Albumasar were very likely the single most important original source for the recovery of Aristotle for medieval European scholars prior to the middle of the 12th century.

Herman of Carinthia&#x27;s translation, &quot;De magnis coniunctionibus&quot;, was first printed by Erhard Ratdolt of Augsburg in 1488/9.
It was again printed in Venice, in 1506 and 1515.

<text>John Andrew Howard Ogdon (27 January 1937 – 1 August 1989) was an English pianist and composer.

==Biography==
===Career===
Ogdon was born in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire; his family moved to Manchester when he was eight. He attended the Manchester Grammar School, before studying at the Royal Northern College of Music (formerly The Royal Manchester College of Music) between 1953 and 1957, where his fellow students under Richard Hall included Harrison Birtwistle, Alexander Goehr, Elgar Howarth and Peter Maxwell Davies. Together they formed New Music Manchester, a group dedicated to the performances of serial and other modern works. His tutor there was Claud Biggs. As a boy he had studied with Iso Elinson and after leaving college, he further studied with Gordon Green, Denis Matthews, Dame Myra Hess, and Egon Petri—the last in Basel, Switzerland.

He won first prize at the London Liszt Competition in 1961 and consolidated his growing international reputation by winning another first prize at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1962, jointly with Vladimir Ashkenazy.

Ogdon was able to play most pieces at sight and had committed a huge range of pieces to memory. He intended to record the complete piano works of Sergei Rachmaninoff, a feat which would constitute about six full-length albums, but only recorded about half of them. The recordings were released in 2001. He recorded all ten Scriabin sonatas in 1971. Ogdon was also a formidable exponent of the works of Alkan and Busoni. In more familiar repertoire, he revealed deep musical sensibilities, always buttressed by a colossal technique. He also recorded a number of duo-piano works with his wife, Brenda Lucas, also known as Brenda Lucas Ogdon.

On 2 February 1969, on British television, he gave the first modern performance of Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Concert Allegro&quot;, Op. 46. The piece was never published and the manuscript had long been believed lost, but it came to light in 1968. Ogdon and Diana McVeigh developed a performing version of the piece from Elgar&#x27;s manuscript, which was full of corrections, deletions and additions. Between 1976 and 1980 Ogdon was Professor of Music (Piano) at Indiana University. He completed four comprehensive tours of Southern Africa to enthusiastic acclaim between 1968 and 1976 and dedicated a composition to his tour organizer Hans Adler.

His own compositions number more than 200, and include four operas, two large works for orchestra, three cantatas, songs, chamber music, a substantial amount of music for solo piano, and two piano concertos, the first of which he recorded. The majority of his music was composed for the piano. These include 50 transcriptions of works by composers as diverse as Stravinsky, Palestrina, Mozart, Satie and Wagner. He also made piano arrangements of songs by Cole Porter, Jerome Kern and George Gershwin and he wrote unaccompanied sonatas for violin, flute and cello. A planned symphony based on the works of Herman Melville, and a comic opera were left unfinished. The original manuscripts of many of Ogdon&#x27;s compositions are deposited in the Royal Northern College of Music Library.

===Breakdown===
Ogdon&#x27;s health was good, and his physical constitution was strong, as his wife often recalled in her biography. Regarded as a &quot;gentle giant&quot;, known and loved for his kindness and generosity, he had tremendous energy. But an everyday business argument seemed to upset him more than expected and then suddenly in 1973 he experienced a severe breakdown. This sometimes changed his personality completely. His illness was initially diagnosed as schizophrenia, but then changed to manic depression (now referred to as bipolar disorder). Either condition may have been inherited from his father, who suffered several psychotic episodes and a mental breakdown. Ogdon spent some time in the Maudsley Hospital in London, and in general needed more nursing than it was possible to provide while touring. Nevertheless, he was reported to maintain three hours&#x27; practice a day on the hospital&#x27;s piano.

In 1983, after emerging from hospital, he played at the opening of the Royal Concert Hall in Nottingham. In 1988 he released a five-disc recording of Sorabji&#x27;s &quot;Opus clavicembalisticum&quot;. He died in August 1989 of pneumonia, brought on by undiagnosed diabetes.

===Legacy===
His wife Brenda, along with writer Michael Kerr, wrote a biography of her life with him in 1981, and released a second edition in 1989, shortly before his death. Another biography by Charles Beauclerk was published in March 2014. One of John Ogdon’s doctoral students at Indiana University, Edna Chun, describes her experiences in studying with John Ogdon in Transformational Music Teaching (2023). 

In the BBC film about his life, &quot;Virtuoso&quot;, based on the biography, Ogdon was played by Alfred Molina, who won a Best Actor award from the Royal Television Society for the performance. The production interpreted Ogdon&#x27;s illness as manic depression rather than schizophrenia, since he had responded much better to treatment for the former condition. Brenda Ogdon also recalled being informed that his obsessive musical work could have been interpreted as a symptom of manic depression.

In June 2014 &quot;John Ogdon: Living with Genius&quot;, directed by Zoe Dobson, was broadcast on BBC Four. The programme was followed by &quot;John Ogdon: A Musical Tribute&quot; featuring piano performances by Peter Donohoe, including Ogdon&#x27;s own &quot;Theme and Variations&quot;.

In 1990, Gordon Rumson, another devoted advocate for Sorabji&#x27;s music, composed the piano piece &quot;Threnody for John Ogdon&quot;. Organist Kevin Bowyer commissioned and premiered Alistair Hinton&#x27;s organ work &quot;Pansophiae for John Ogdon&quot; (Hinton is the curator of the Sorabji Archive and worked with Ogdon on the recording of Sorabji&#x27;s &quot;Opus clavicembalisticum&quot;).

Ogdon is survived by his daughter and son, Annabel and Richard Ogdon.

<doc id="1253611" wikidata="Q1523834" url="?curid=1253611" title="River Teifi">
<text>The River Teifi ( ; , ), formerly anglicised as Tivy, forms the boundary for most of its length between the Welsh counties of Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire, and for the final of its total length of , the boundary between Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire. Its estuary is northwest of Cardigan, known in Welsh as , meaning &#x27;mouth of the Teifi&#x27;.

==Geography==
The Teifi has its source in Llyn Teifi, one of several lakes known collectively as the Teifi Pools. These are situated towards the north of the county of Ceredigion; the source is in the Cambrian Mountains at . This wide area of Mid-Wales, with a very sparse population, is part of what is sometimes called the &quot;Desert of Wales&quot;. The river flows past Strata Florida Abbey and then through Pontrhydfendigaid before turning broadly southwest. Here it passes through Cors Caron, one of the great raised mires of Britain also known as Tregaron Bog or Cors Goch Glanteifi (translates from Welsh as &quot;red bog on the banks of the Teifi&quot;). From here the river descends through pastures and bogs forming meanders on farmland below. Several small tributaries join from the valley with gorges, rocky and tree-lined sections also in the area.

Over the next , the Teifi meanders southwest in a gentle arc passing through Tregaron, Llanddewi Brefi, Cwmann, Lampeter, Llanybydder, Llandysul, Newcastle Emlyn, and Cenarth. The river is tidal below Llechryd, descending through the steep-sided Cilgerran Gorge to Cardigan. West of Cardigan and St Dogmaels, the river broadens into a wide estuary with Poppit Sands on its west bank and Gwbert on its east bank as it enters Cardigan Bay.

On the lower parts of the river the wildlife is rich. There is a large variety ranging from water-crowfoot to Atlantic salmon as well as otters, wetland birds and multi fruited river moss. There have also been sightings of bottle-nosed dolphins where the river opens into the estuary.

It is sometimes asserted that the Afon Tywi at and Afon Teifi at are the longest rivers wholly in Wales though at about , the River Usk exceeds both.

The river is susceptible to flooding and there were some heavy floods in 2007 and 2008. If the swollen river is backed up by a high tide, flooding can occur in Cardigan and as far up river as Llechryd. The most recent flooding was in December 2015.

The principal tributaries of the Teifi (ordered from source to sea) are as follows: Afon Mwyro, Nant Glasffrwd, Afon Meurig, Afon Fflur, Camddwr Fach, Camddwr, Brennig, Nant Carfan, Afon Brefi, Nant Digonest, Nant Clywedog, Ffrwd Cynon, Nant Gou, Nant Dulas, Nant Hathren, Nant Eiddig, Nant y Gwragedd, Nant Dolgwm, Afon Granell, Afon Duar, Nant Hust, Nant Ceiliog, Nant Caradog, Nant Cwm-du, Nant Cledlyn, Nant Fylchog, Afon Clettwr, Nant Wern-macwydd, Gwenffrwd, Afon Cerdin, Afon Tyweli, Nant Merwydd, Hoffnant, Afon Gwr-fach, Afon Siedi, Camnant, Nant Bachnog, Nant Iago, Nant Bargod, Afon Cynllo, Afon Cwm-wern, Nant Halen, Afon Arad, Nant Sarah, Afon Ceri, Afon Nawmor, Afon Hirwaun, Afon Cych, Afon Eifed, Nant Arberth, Afon Morgenau, Afon Plysgog, Nant Rhyd-y-fuwch, Afon Piliau, Afon Mwldan, Nant Degwen, Nant-y-ferwig.

==Geology and landscape==
The Teifi and its tributaries are underlain by ancient Ordovician and Silurian mudstones which have been extensively glaciated during the ice ages. The resultant landform is one of gently rolling hills supporting a range of agriculture in which dairy and sheep farming dominate. Ceredigion had the reputation of supplying London with its milk in the 19th century. The landscapes of the Teifi valley are very attractive and the Teifi is considered by many to be one of the most beautiful rivers in Wales.

Teifi Pools, the source of the Teifi, are a series of small upland lakes left by past glacial activity. The lakes are acidic in nature. Some have been enlarged by damming and now provide a source of drinking water. The very extensive raised mire above Tregaron acts as a huge sponge at the head of the river and evens out extremes in flow.

Rapids and waterfalls are uncommon but the examples at Henllan and, especially at Cenarth, are noteworthy and have been extensively photographed and painted because of the beauty of the landscape. A dramatic painting of the falls was made by Frank Miles and is now at Nottingham City Museum. Miles&#x27;s father inherited Cardigan Priory from his father, Philip John Miles, but lived in Nottinghamshire as Rector of Bingham.

The river enters a narrow gorge between Llechryd and Cilgerran, the sides of which are thickly wooded with a distinctive under-storey flora of wood rush.

==SSSI==

The Teifi has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (&quot;SSSI&quot;) since December 1997 in an attempt to protect the rare and unique features and species within it. This SSSI has been notified as being of both geological and biological importance. It is protected by law. The site has an area of 778.18 hectares and is managed by Natural Resources Wales.

==Hydrology==
The catchment of the river is estimated to be yielding an average flow at Glan Teifi, just upstream of Llechryd Bridge, of 29.126 m³/s. The maximum recorded flow between 1959 and 2011 was 373.6 m³/s on 18 October 1987. The average annual rainfall varies from in the upper catchment to in the lower catchment, which is higher than the average for United Kingdom at .

==Culture and history==
The Teifi valley has been inhabited since pre-history. There are many remains of Iron Age and Stone Age man including cromlechs (burial chambers) and standing stones. The remains of a medieval abbey stand at Strata Florida with some excellent examples of encaustic tiles on the floors. The river flows near to the Lampeter campus of the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, its predecessor, the University of Wales, Lampeter (est. 1822) having been the oldest university established in Wales. The river forms the southern boundary of the hamlet of Pen-y-wenallt.

Between Cenarth and Cardigan, there is an ancient tradition of fishing and travel using coracles – very simple light-weight boats made of bent sticks covered with waterproofed hide or skins. These are paddled by a single oar used at the front of the craft which requires great skill. The principal use for coracles is for salmon fishing using nets. This form of fishing is now very tightly controlled and the right to fish in this way is passed down from father to son. There is also an age-old tradition of illegal salmon and sea-trout fishing in the lower Teifi. In 1188 Giraldus Cambrensis observed what is thought to have been the last colony of European beaver in England or Wales on the Teifi.

In modern times, the river Teifi is still important to the population that surrounds it and currently serves as the complete water source for the local area of Mid &amp; South Ceredigion.

Concern over the health of the river has been reported, which include the levels of phosphates, nitrates, and sewage pollution. Following an analysis of data collected by environmental agencies,
it has been stated the River Teifi has the most sewage discharges in Wales. A report of this analysis concluded the river Teifi as the 9th most polluted river in the UK. Further concern was reported by local press in March 2023 after 10 tonnes of debris and agricultural waste was pulled from a 3km stretch of the river in Llandysul.

<doc id="1253612" wikidata="Q6429164" url="?curid=1253612" title="Kong von thom">
<text>The kong von thom or kong thom () plays a melodic line in the Cambodian &quot;pinpeat&quot; ensemble almost identical to that of the roneat thung (large xylophone). The &quot;kong thom&quot; dwells more steadily on the pulse without pulling or delaying the beat (melody). The player uses soft mallets for indoor performance, hard ones for outdoors. The &quot;kong von thom&quot; is analogous to the &quot;khong wong yai&quot; used in Thailand.

== History ==
The Khmer word &quot;korng/ kong&quot; &quot;gong&quot; is refers to all types of gong including the flat or bossed gong, single or in a set, suspended on cords from hooks, or a gong placed over a frame. The history of these gongs can be traced in part from the epigraphy and iconography of Funan-Chenla and Angkor periods, for many can be seen carved on ancient Khmer temple.

== Construction ==
The gong circle-maker creates sixteen bossed gongs made of copper with bronze admixture. He suspends them on rattan frames in a circle around the player. He tunes the individual gongs by dripping into the upturned boss a mixture of mud-lead, rice husks, and beeswax.

The &quot;kong thom&quot;&#x27;s smaller cousin is called kong toch.

==Name similarity==
Another also uses instrument the shorter name &quot;Kong thom&quot; — a hanging gong. That instrument is not used in orchestras.

<text>Mario Aburto Martínez (born 3 October 1970) is a Mexican man who was convicted for assassinating presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio in 1994. He confessed to the murder and was sentenced to 42 years in prison. Despite the confession and conviction, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that there was widespread belief within Mexico that the conviction involved a conspiracy and coverup mainly by Carlos Salinas de Gortari (the president at that time) and Manuel Camacho Solís (a member of Salinas&#x27; cabinet). A later Mexican film called &quot;Colosio, el asesinato&quot; alleged that the Salinas government was behind the crime.

<text>Högdalen (the High Valley) is a suburban district in South Stockholm, Sweden, built around the metro station with this name on line 19. It was connected to Stockholm City Centre in 1954, three years after the town planning of the Högdalen district was approved.

Högdalen (&quot;High Valley&quot;) is roughly divided between the residential and commercial areas near the metro station in the centre and the industrial area and landfill further to the east. The inhabitants tend to vote mostly for the Social Democrats and the Left Party (in the election of 2006, the left block won with 55,7% of the votes). As of 2006 7,862 people lived in Högdalen, distributed across an area of 2.01 km2, which gives a density of 3,911/km2. The unemployment rate was 4,9%.

Notable landmarks in Högdalen are the neon rooster on top of an apartment block in the commercial area, and the golden rooster on top of the local church. 

The independent theatre group is based in Högdalen, where its main stage is located (there is a small one in Kungsholmen as well).

Högdalen is part of Vantör borough, together with four other suburban districts.

<text>Affairs of the Heart is the third studio album by American pop singer Jody Watley, released on December 3, 1991, by MCA Records. (see 1991 in music). &quot;Affairs of the Heart&quot; supplies a handful of energetic dance numbers and a plentiful selection of quiet storm ballads, the new material result is a set that&#x27;s much thicker and deeper sound. Watley co-wrote nine of the album&#x27;s 11 tracks, which delivers a good mixture flow of R&amp;B-funk, to classy house, to inspirational dance pop and groovy melody Motown-inspired soul.

==Commercial performance==
The album produced the following hit singles: &quot;I Want You&quot; a top five on US R&amp;B Singles and no. 61 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; the second single &quot;I&#x27;m the One You Need&quot; hit top 20 on both the US Hot 100 and US R&amp;B, and top five on US Dance/Club Play Songs chart. Its third and final single &quot;It All Begins With You&quot; received moderate airplay and peaked at no. 48 on US Adult Contemporary, but failed to chart on the Hot 100 or R&amp;B singles.

<doc id="1253619" wikidata="Q4655574" url="?curid=1253619" title="A Book of Prefaces">
<text>A Book of Prefaces is H. L. Mencken&#x27;s 1917 collection of essays criticizing American culture, authors, and movements. Mencken described the work as &quot;[My] most important book in its effects upon my professional career.&quot; In fact, the book was considered vitriolic enough that Mencken&#x27;s close friend Alfred Knopf was concerned about publishing it because of the massive increase in patriotism during World War I in America.

The book was eighty pages long and divided into four essays. The first three were concerned with specific writers: Theodore Dreiser, Joseph Conrad and James Gibbons Huneker, respectively.

But perhaps the most important, and certainly the most outspoken essay was entitled &quot;Puritanism as a Literary Force,&quot; during which he alleged that William Dean Howells, Henry James, and Mark Twain were victims of the Puritan spirit.

:&quot;The Puritan&#x27;s utter lack of aesthetic sense, his distrust of all romantic emotion, his unmatchable intolerance of opposition, his unbreakable belief in his own bleak and narrow views, his savage cruelty of attack, his lust for relentless and barbarous persecution – these things have put an almost unbearable burden up on the exchange of ideas in the United States.&quot;

Mencken had criticized Puritanism for many years, famously characterizing it as &quot;the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy,&quot; but through World War I his criticism became increasingly outspoken, in part due to the rising tide of Prohibition.

Mencken&#x27;s book triggered the imagination of a famous American author. As a teen first entering the world of reading and books in the early 1920s, Richard Wright found literary inspiration in &quot;A Book of Prefaces&quot;.

==Response==

===Critical response===
Response to Mencken&#x27;s book was generally poor, but certain defenders of American culture were particularly outspoken in their criticism of the book—most notably Stuart Sherman, a professor at the University of Illinois (Sherman was personally attacked in Prefaces). According to Sherman:

&quot;[Mencken] leaps from the saddle with sabre flashing, stables his horse in the church, shoots the priest, hangs three professors, exiles the Academy, burns the library and the university, and amid smoking ashes, erects a new school of criticism on modern German principles.&quot;

Other major critics included Paul Elmer More and Irving Babbitt, although neither of these was as vitriolic as Sherman.

===Mencken&#x27;s response===
According to Mencken, Sherman&#x27;s review was &quot;a masterly exposure of what is going on in the Puritan mind, and particularly of its maniacal fear of the German.&quot;

&quot;The curse of criticism in America is the infernal babbling of third-rate college professor... [the Book of Prefaces] shook the professors as they had never been shaken before.&quot;

<doc id="1253622" wikidata="Q7092361" url="?curid=1253622" title="One-way voice link">
<text>A one-way voice link (OWVL) is typically a radio based communication method used by spy networks to communicate with agents in the field typically (but not exclusively) using shortwave radio frequencies. 

Shortwave frequencies were and are generally highly preferred for their long range, as a communications link of 1200 km is easily possible. VHF and UHF frequencies can be used for one-way voice circuits, but are generally not preferred as their range is at best 300 km (on flat terrain). Since the 1970s infrared point-to-point communication systems have been used that offer OWVLs, but the number of users was always limited. 

This communications system often employs recorders to transmit pre-recorded messages in real time or in burst transmissions, which minimize the time that a spy needs to be on the air. Voice-scrambling systems have been selectively used for this kind of communications circuit since the 1980s, based on operational needs.

Since personal computers became cheap and readily available in the 2000s, time compressed voice scrambling for one-way and bi-directional circuits is a practically free technology. 

OWVLs have existed outside espionage, for example the NICAM transmission system was modified in the UK to allow for an OWVL to BBC mobile units. This OWVL was typically used for sports events, as it was highly flexible.

== Historical context ==
During the mid- to late Cold War the STASI (the East German intelligence agency) used point-to-point infrared technology for 2-way voice links within the divided city of Berlin. OWVLs were used intermittently.

OWVL transmission methods were used during the Falklands War by UK elite forces to provide information about suitable troop landing areas. This fact emerged in the late 1980s when UK veterans of the war were writing their memoirs. Argentina had access to similar technology to communicate with its military, but did not really use it during this conflict.

<doc id="1253623" wikidata="Q6429165" url="?curid=1253623" title="Kong toch">
<text>The kong vong toch ( or kong touch ) is a number of gongs that are attached to a circle-shaped rack, closely resembling its larger relative, the kong thom. Both instruments belong to the percussion family of traditional Khmer instruments, along with the roneat ek, roneat dek, and roneat thung. These instruments are all performed in the pinpeat and mahaori orchestras. The kong toch is made of three parts; the frame of the gong circle, the gongs themselves, and the gong mallets.

The &quot;kong toch&quot; is analogous to the &quot;khong wong lek&quot; used in Thai.

==History==
The Khmer word &quot;korng/ kong&quot; &quot;gong&quot; is refers to all types of gong including the flat or bossed gong, single or in a set, suspended on cords from hooks, or a gong placed over a frame. The history of these gongs can be traced in part from the epigraphy and iconography of Funan-Chenla and Angkor periods, for many can be seen carved on ancient Khmer temple.

==Construction and Design==
Gong Frame

The frame of the gong circle is made from a rattan vine which is smoothed and rounded into shape. Four lengths of the vine are taken to make one frame. The lengths are divided into two pairs, a shorter pair for the inner circle and a longer pair for the outer. The instrument is held up with 16 supports, made of neang nuen, krennoonf, or beng wood. The gong circle is held together with six crossbars, designed to keep the distance between the inner and outer frames fixed. Copper wires are wrapped around the length of each support post, one on the inner and one on the outer.

Gong Heads/Mallets

There are 16 gong heads, which cover a range of pitches. They are rounded and flat in shape with a raised knob in the middle, known as the nipple. The nipple is crucial to the sound, as this is the part being struck by the player. In addition to this, the gongs are tuned by sticking promor (a lead and wax combination) to the underside of the nipple. Two holes are drilled on either side of the gong so it can be suspended in the frame with copper wire. The same gong mallets are used for the kong toch and the kong thom. The mallets have a 25 cm long stick. The heads are made from the earlier mentioned promor, which is then wrapped in four or five layers of cloth and stitched with nylon thread.

Tuning

The kong toch&#x27;s 16 gong heads are tuned accordingly: (from lowest to highest pitch)

<text>A growbag is a planter filled with a growing medium and used for growing plants, usually tomatoes or other salad crops. Originally made of plastic, modern bags are also made from jute or fabric. The growing medium is usually based on a soilless organic material such as peat, coir, composted green waste, composted bark or composted wood chips, or a mixture of these. Various nutrients are added, sufficient for one season&#x27;s growing, so frequently only planting and watering are required of the end-user. Planting is undertaken by first laying the bag flat on the floor or bench of the growing area, then cutting access holes in the uppermost surface, into which the plants are inserted.

Growbags were first produced in the 1970s for home use, but their use has since spread into market gardening and farming. They come in different sizes and formulations suited to specific crops.

Prior to the introduction of growbags, greenhouse soil had to be replaced or sterilized each season between crops to prevent a buildup of pests and diseases in the ground. Commercial growers could steam sterilize their ground, but this was not feasible for the amateur grower so growbags were introduced. At the end of the season the plants are disposed of and the compost spread over outdoor borders. The bags should not be reused.

<text>Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates (KPF) is an American architectural firm based in New York City that provides architecture, interior, programming and master planning services. They engineer different projects including civic and cultural spaces, commercial office buildings, transportation facilities, residential and hospitality developments, educational and institutional facilities, and mixed-use commercial developments.

== History ==

===Beginnings in the United States (1976–1980s)===
KPF was founded in 1976 by A. Eugene Kohn, William Pedersen, and Sheldon Fox, all of whom coordinated their departure from John Carl Warnecke &amp; Associates, among the largest architectural firms in the country. Shortly thereafter, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) chose KPF to redevelop a former armory building on Manhattan&#x27;s West Side to house TV studios and offices. This led to 14 more projects for ABC over the next 11 years, as well as commissions from major corporations across the country, including AT&amp;T and Hercules Incorporated. By the mid-1980s, KPF had nearly 250 architects working on projects in cities throughout the United States. In 1985, John Burgee (of rival architecture firm John Burgee Architects) called KPF &quot;The best commercial firm now practicing in the U.S.&quot; KPF&#x27;s design for 333 Wacker Drive in Chicago (1983), which was awarded the AIA National Honor Award in 1984, made the firm nationally famous. It remains a Chicago landmark, and was voted &quot;Favorite Building&quot; by the readers of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in both 1995 and 1997. In 1986, KPF&#x27;s Procter &amp; Gamble Headquarters in Cincinnati, which included an open plan interior design by Patricia Conway, was recognized for its innovative design with the AIA National Honor Award.
 After its success with these projects, KPF was selected to design the IBM World Headquarters in Armonk, New York (1997), the Chicago Title and Trust Building in Chicago (1992), and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (1993).

In the 1990s, KPF also took on a larger number of government and civic projects, including the Foley Square U.S. Courthouse in New York (1995), the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse in Portland, Oregon (1996), the U.S. Courthouse of Minneapolis (1996), the Buffalo Niagara International Airport (1993) and the multiple award-winning redevelopment of The World Bank Headquarters in Washington, D.C. (1996).

KPF&#x27;s winning entry in the international competition for the World Bank Headquarters, which drew 76 entrants from 26 countries, was the only entry that included the retention of existing structures.

===Expansion to Europe (1980s–1990s)===
In the 1980s and 1990s, KPF transformed from an American firm known for its corporate designs into an international firm with institutional, government, and transportation commissions in addition to corporate work.

KPF completed the design for two blocks of the large-scale Canary Wharf redevelopment (1987) and the Goldman Sachs Headquarters on Fleet Street (1987–1991). KPF has been selected for projects in the Canary Wharf area through to the present day, including the Clifford Chance Tower (2002) to KPMG&#x27;s European Headquarters (2009). KPF&#x27;s subsequent work in the United Kingdom includes Thames Court in London (1998), the Rothermere American Institute at Oxford University (2001) and the master plan for the London School of Economics (2002). KPF&#x27;s design for the award-winning Westendstraße 1 in Frankfurt (1992), an early example of mixed-use design, further increased the firm&#x27;s international prominence and solidified the firm&#x27;s reputation as a progressive global practice. KPF was chosen for subsequent projects throughout Europe, including Provinciehuis in The Hague (1998), Danube House in River City, Prague (2003), the expansion and renovation of the World Trade Center in Amsterdam (2004) and the Endesa Headquarters in Madrid (2003).

===Work in Asia and internationally (1990s–2009)===
KPF&#x27;s introduction to the Asian market began with the Japan Railways Central Towers project in Nagoya (1999). Within 10 years, KPF had projects in Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. Completed KPF projects in Asia include Plaza 66 on Shanghai&#x27;s Nanjing Xi Lu (2001), Roppongi Hills in Tokyo (2003), Continental Engineering Corporation Tower in Taipei (2003), the Rodin Pavilion in Seoul (2003), the Merrill Lynch Japan Head Office in Tokyo (2004), Shr-Hwa International Tower in Taichung (2004), and the Shanghai World Financial Center (2008), which was named the &quot;Best Tall Building Overall&quot; by the Council on Tall Buildings and the Urban Habitat in 2008. KPF worked with renowned structural engineers, Leslie E. Robertson Associates, to maximize the tower&#x27;s floor plate and material efficiency by perfecting its tapered form. In addition to this work in Asia, KPF has completed projects in: the Middle East, including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority Headquarters (2007) and the Marina Towers in Beirut (2008); South America including Ventura Corporate Towers in Rio de Janeiro (2008) and Infinity Tower in São Paulo (2012); Australia, including Chifley Tower in Sydney (1992); and has also worked on several projects in Africa.

=== Expanded national and global presence (2010–present) ===
Four decades after its founding, KPF has refined particular expertise in the area of office design, supertall structures, and large-scale, urban, mixed use developments.

In November 2018, the firm announced the opening of new offices in San Francisco, Berlin, and Singapore to support current projects, new commissions, and imminent endeavors in those regions.

The firm&#x27;s high-profile projects include One Vanderbilt, a new supertall office tower in Midtown Manhattan located next to Grand Central Terminal and providing direct access to the station; and the master plan for Hudson Yards, the largest private real estate development in U.S. history, which mixes residences with offices, hotels and retail, and street life. KPF also designed buildings 10 Hudson Yards, 20 Hudson Yards, 30 Hudson Yards, and 55 Hudson Yards, which together offer office, retail, and hospitality space within the development.

Also in New York, KPF is leading the redevelopment of New York City Housing Authority&#x27;s (NYCHA) Red Hook Houses, which suffered severe flooding and wind damage during Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The largest public housing development in Brooklyn, Red Hook Houses accommodates over 6,000 people across 28 buildings.

Outside of the United States, KPF has been contributing to the regeneration and conservation of the Covent Garden Estate in the roles of both master planner and architect for a collection of buildings. Also in London, the firm designed 52 Lime Street, known as The Scalpel.

==Recent work==
KPF&#x27;s projects include civic and cultural spaces, commercial office buildings, transportation facilities, residential and hospitality developments, educational and institutional facilities, and mixed-use commercial developments.

In Boston, KPF is currently designing two waterfront projects: Channelside, three buildings with housing, office, labs, and retail on the Fort Point Waterfront and The Pinnacle at Central Wharf, a 600-foot residential, office, and retail tower downtown. KPF is also designing the University of Michigan&#x27;s Detroit Center for Innovation, 601 West Pender in Vancouver, 81 Newgate Street in London, and The Bermondsey Project in south London, which will create around 1,548 homes on the site. KPF is also planning and designing the new Hong Kong University of Science and Technology &quot;sustainable, smart campus&quot; in Guangzhou.

<text>==Rulers of the Kingdom of Allada==

This is a chronological list of rulers of the Kingdom of Allada, also known as &quot;Ardrah&quot; (&quot;Ardra&quot;), &quot;Ardrah Empire&quot;, &quot;Adja-Tado&quot;. and known to the French as &quot;Allada&quot; or &quot;Ardres&quot;. Named for its capital, the modern Allada, which was also the main city and major port of the realm the territory is located in present-day Benin.

The city and kingdom were supposedly founded by a group of Aja migrants from Tado, a settlement along the Mono River, in the 12th or 13th century. Its kings &quot;ruled with the consent of the elders of the people&quot;. 

While historically a sovereign kingdom, in present times the monarchy continues to exist as a non-sovereign monarchy within the republic of Benin

<doc id="1253643" wikidata="Q7410116" url="?curid=1253643" title="Samphor">
<text>The samphor (; also romanized as &quot;sampho&quot;) is a small, 2-headed barrel drum indigenous to Cambodia, approximately .35 meter wide by .5 meter long. It has two heads, with one drumhead being larger than the other and is played with both hands. Depending on the ability of the musician, the samphor can make as many as 8 different pitches. The player of the sampho leads the &quot;pinpeat&quot; (a classical ensemble of wind and percussion instruments), setting the tempo and beat. It is also played at freestyle boxing evens, accompanying the sralai. The &quot;samphor&quot; is analogous to the &quot;taphon&quot; used in Thailand.

The &quot;samphor&quot; is made by hollowing out a single block of wood into a barrel shape. Both ends are covered with calfskin, tightened by strips of leather or rattan. One head of the drum is larger than the other to allow differing tones. Traditionally, the maker &quot;tunes&quot; each head by applying a circle of paste made of rice and ashes (from a palm); however a new resin paste is available today. The pitch to which the skin head is tuned becomes lower with a thicker layer of ash.

The drummer makes use of four distinct strokes: an open and closed stroke for each head.
Each of these four sounds has a Cambodian name: 
:Open stroke, small head (ting) 
:Closed stroke, small head (tip) 
:Open stroke, large head (theung) 
:Closed stroke, large head (tup)

<text>The Fernmeldeturm Berlin (Telecommunications Tower Berlin) is a telecommunication tower located atop the Schäferberg hill in Berlin-Wannsee. The tower was built between 1961 and 1964, and is not open to the public. Owner and operator of the site is Deutsche Funkturm (DFMG), a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom.

The Fernmeldeturm Berlin is tall, and its steel-reinforced concrete shaft extends to a height of . Between in elevation, the tower houses six floors for technical equipment. This currently consists of transmitters for DVB-T digital television, analog [|FM]] radio, and newer DAB and DMB digital radio. 

From 1964 to the early nineties, the tower was used to implement two over-the-horizon radio links to the rest of West Germany. The city of Berlin was geographically isolated, so unusual means were necessary to bridge the distance. One such link used bundled arrays of directional antennas mounted near the top to establish a near-line-of sight connection at 250 MHz and 400 MHz to the tower at Gartow. The other used tropospheric scatter at 2 GHz to establish a non-line-of-sight link to Torfhaus. To that end the tower was equipped with two Parabolic reflector antennas, each in diameter, which were mounted on the lower portion of the tower. They were removed in 1996. Because of these aerials, the Fernmeldeturm Berlin had to be designed to withstand triple the wind loading of the comparably sized TV tower in Stuttgart. The concrete shaft is thus in diameter at the bottom, with a wall thickness of . At the mark, the shaft is nigh in diameter.

Directly adjacent to the Fernmeldeturm Berlin is a free standing steel framework tower. Formerly it supported two diameter parabolic aerials for an over-the-horizon radio link, also to Torfhaus. These have since been removed. It is now predominantly used for cellular network aerials.

Since 2001, the Fernmeldeturm Berlin is also used for transmissions in the medium wave range on 1485 kHz in DRM mode. Since the tower was not designed to accommodate this frequency range, a long wire aerial was installed for this purpose.

<text>Dorothea &quot;Theodora&quot; Binz (16 March 1920 – 2 May 1947) was a Nazi German officer and supervisor at Ravensbrück concentration camp during the Holocaust. She was known as one of the most brutal, ruthless and sadistic overseers and in the Nazi system. She was executed for war crimes on 2 May 1947.

==Early life==
Born to a lower middle-class German family in Försterei Dusterlake, Brandenburg, Germany, Binz attended school until she was 15.

==Atrocities at Ravensbrück concentration camp==
She volunteered for kitchen work at Ravensbrück in August 1939, when she was aged 19, and was given a position of &quot;Aufseherin&quot; (female overseer) the following month.

Binz served as an &quot;Aufseherin&quot; under &quot;Oberaufseherin&quot; Emma Zimmer, Johanna Langefeld, Maria Mandl, and Anna Klein. Though she worked under higher-ranking guards, Binz was known as &quot;the true star of the camp&quot;, and the &quot;chief guard was completely overshadowed by her deputy.&quot; She worked in various parts of the camp, including the kitchen and laundry. Later, she is said to have supervised the bunker where prisoners were tortured and killed. She began as deputy director of her penal block in September 1940, and became director of the cell block in the summer of 1942.

Binz was unofficially promoted to &quot;Stellvertretende Oberaufseherin&quot; (Deputy Chief Wardress) in July 1943; the promotion was made official in February 1944. Her abuse was later described as &quot;unyielding&quot;. She was known to &quot;watch for the weakest or most fearful prisoners, whom she would then shower with lashes or blows.&quot; As a member of the command staff between 1943 and 1945, she directed training and assigned duties to over 100 female guards at one time. Binz reportedly trained some of the cruellest female guards in the system, including Ruth Closius, and many conscripts who became guards testified after the war that they had been trained by her.

At Ravensbrück, the young Binz is said to have beaten, slapped, kicked, shot, whipped, stomped and sexually abused prisoners and set trained fighting dogs on them. Witnesses testified that when she appeared at the &quot;Appellplatz&quot;, &quot;silence fell&quot; as she instilled panic and fear. Any prisoners who dared to look at her risked having her select them to be killed in the gas chambers. She reportedly carried a whip in hand, along with a leashed German Shepherd, and without any provocation notice would kick prisoners to death. It was also believed that she hacked a prisoner to death with an axe during work detail.

Binz reportedly had a boyfriend in the camp, an SS officer, Edmund Bräuning. The couple reportedly went on romantic walks around the camp to watch prisoners being flogged, after which they would stroll away laughing. They lived together in a house outside the camp walls until late 1944, when Bräuning was transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp.

==Capture and execution==
Binz fled Ravensbrück during the death march, but was captured on 3 May 1945 by the British in Hamburg, and incarcerated in the Recklinghausen camp (formerly a Buchenwald subcamp). She was tried for war crimes with other SS personnel by a British court in the Ravensbrück trial in 1947. Binz was found guilty and sentenced to death. Hours after her death sentence was confirmed in April 1947, she attempted to kill herself by slashing her wrists. However, officials intervened before she could bleed to death.

Binz was subsequently hanged at Hamelin Prison by British executioner Albert Pierrepoint on 2 May 1947. Her last words were to Pierrepoint, and she supposedly said to him: &quot;I hope you will not think we are all evil people&quot; just before her death.

<text>The sralai () is a Cambodian wind instrument that uses a quadruple reed to produce sound. The instrument is used in the &quot;pinpeat&quot; orchestra, where it is the only wind instrument. The set of quadruple reeds are made of palm leaf. The bore of the instrument is not evenly bored, but &quot;slightly conical.&quot; Its cousin, the Western oboe, has a double reed and a conical bore. The pinpeat instruments tune to the sralai&#x27;s pitch, and the player must learn circular breathing to play continuously without stopping for breath. The &quot;sralai&quot; is very similar in construction and playing technique to the Thai &quot;pi&quot;.

<text>Heinrich Leopold Wagner (19 February 1747 – 4 March 1779) was a German dramatist of the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement.

Wagner was born in Strasbourg as the eldest son of a merchant. After his school years in Strasbourg, he studied Law. In 1773, he went to Saarbrücken, where he worked as a tutor at the court. From there in 1774 he travelled to Frankfurt am Main via Zweibrücken and Gießen. In 1776, he resumed his studies in Strasbourg and finished with his doctoral examination. From the 21 September 1776 he worked as a lawyer in Frankfurt. He married a widowed woman 18 years older than him and died on the 4 March 1779 at the young age of 32, probably from tuberculosis. Wagner had contact with several important writers of the Sturm und Drang movement, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Maximillian Klinger, (1752–1831), Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz, (1753–1795), Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart (1739–1791) and Johann Friedrich Müller, known as Maler Müller, (1749–1825). Together with Klinger and Lenz Wangner was known by his contemporaries as a &quot;Goethianer&quot;, since these authors were among Goethe&#x27;s closest friends. He was seen nonetheless as the least important of the &quot;Goethianer.&quot; His most important work was a play written in 1776 titled &quot;The Child Murderess&quot;, a societal critique typical of the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement. The work was reworked by Peter Hacks in 1957.

<doc id="1253665" wikidata="Q2107990" url="?curid=1253665" title="The Late Late Show (American talk show)">
<text>The Late Late Show is an American late-night television talk and variety comedy show that originally aired from January 9, 1995, to April 27, 2023, on CBS. Tom Snyder was the show&#x27;s first host, followed by Craig Kilborn, Craig Ferguson, and James Corden. The show originated from Television City in Los Angeles.

==History==
===Tom Snyder (1995–1999)===
Tom Snyder hosted the program from its inception in January 1995 until March 1999. The choice of Snyder as host was made by David Letterman, whose contract with CBS gave him (via production company Worldwide Pants) the power to produce the show in the time slot immediately after his own program and who had an affinity for Snyder, whose NBC late night series &quot;Tomorrow&quot; had been succeeded by &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. The time slot on CBS previously carried repeats of &quot;Crimetime After Primetime&quot;. Snyder departed CNBC to host &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on CBS.

Letterman and Snyder had a long history together: a 1978 &quot;Tomorrow&quot; episode hosted by Snyder was almost exclusively devoted to a long interview with up-and-coming new comedy talents Letterman, Billy Crystal and Merrill Markoe. And in 1982, when &quot;Tomorrow&quot; was cancelled by NBC, Letterman&#x27;s series &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; succeeded &quot;Tomorrow&quot; in the timeslot, and Snyder had been offered but refused a move to follow &quot;Late Night&quot; by NBC.

Snyder&#x27;s show featured a mix of celebrities, politicians and other newsmakers, but was otherwise quite unlike the program hosted by Letterman; Snyder was a former newsman, not a comedian, and his show featured an intimate interview format with no studio audience present, similar to his old &quot;Tomorrow&quot; show of the 1970s, or to &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; show and &quot;Later&quot;, which had abandoned the format the previous year and had followed &quot;Late Night&quot; under Letterman on NBC. Though the show lacked a studio audience, Snyder still frequently gave extended conversational monologues, many of which contained jokes that prompted audible laughter from the off-camera production staff. Without the need for an audience, the show originated from the intimate Studio 58 at CBS Television City.

Throughout most of the show&#x27;s run, it was also simulcast over some CBS Radio stations, and Snyder accepted calls from viewers/listeners somewhat in the manner of Larry King; to accommodate this, the show was broadcast live in the Eastern and Central United States and on radio in the west, a rarity for late-night talk shows that had otherwise transitioned to tape, though due to existing syndication contracts and resistance to give up local control of timeslots, many stations, such as WJZ-TV in Baltimore, would delay it to as late as 3:05 a.m. When Snyder was on vacation, the show featured guest hosts such as Jon Stewart or Janeane Garofalo.

Saxophonist David Sanborn composed and performed the theme music and several other songs featured on the show, all of which were smooth jazz pieces to fit the show&#x27;s low-key, middle-of-the-night mood. Sanborn had previously been a guest saxophonist in The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Band during &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. Unlike other late-night shows, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; did not have a house band (a tradition that carried on to its iterations under Kilborn and Ferguson) or any announcer, except for the last episode, when Snyder allowed one of his staff members to announce an introduction.

Letterman had offered the &quot;Late Late&quot; spot to Garry Shandling, a former permanent guest host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, but Shandling turned the offer down in favor of &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; (NBC had previously approached Shandling about succeeding Letterman on &quot;Late Night&quot; but he had also declined that offer, the job ultimately went to Conan O&#x27;Brien). He also offered the slot to &quot;Later&quot; host Bob Costas who also declined. Shandling lampooned the selection process on an episode of &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; entitled &quot;Life After Larry&quot; in which Snyder is poached from the post-Letterman timeslot for the spot following the fictional Sanders show.
Letterman then insisted on Snyder despite CBS wanting a younger host with a comedy background and a more traditional late night talk variety format. In 1998, the network reportedly reasserted its desire for a host who could attract a younger demographic and asked Worldwide Pants not to renew Snyder&#x27;s contract when it expired in September 1999, though other reports portray the decision to leave as Snyder&#x27;s decision, with Snyder informing management that he wished to depart before his contract ended, as early as January 1999. Snyder would return to CBS to guest-host some episodes of the &quot;Late Show&quot; while Letterman recuperated from heart surgery in 2000.

Longtime late night television producer Peter Lassally was executive producer of Snyder&#x27;s iteration of the program and mentored Jon Stewart when he was a guest host filling in for Snyder.

===Craig Kilborn (1999–2004)===

When Snyder announced he was leaving, the show was reformatted to resemble &quot;Letterman&quot; and other major late-night talk programs. Craig Kilborn took over in March 1999, having left &quot;The Daily Show&quot; (where he was succeeded by Jon Stewart) to become the new &quot;Late Late Show&quot; host (previously he was an anchor on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;).

Kilborn left the program on August 27, 2004, two weeks after surprising executives at CBS and Worldwide Pants by announcing after several weeks of talks that he was not seeking a contract renewal. In a June 2010 interview, Kilborn stated that he left late-night television due to his belief that the late-night time slot was too crowded for him to succeed. Executive Producer Peter Lassally later claimed that Kilborn quit because he did not get the raise he wanted.

===Transition (September–December 2004)===
With Kilborn only announcing in early August that he would not be returning to the &quot;Late Late Show&quot; in the fall, CBS and Worldwide Pants executives decided to have a series of guest hosts helm the show in on-air auditions. While initially saying they would choose a permanent host by the end of October, the process ended up extending into December. Drew Carey was the first guest host on September 20, 2004, and again the following night. Subsequent guest hosts included: Jason Alexander, Jeff Altman, Tom Arnold, Michael Ian Black, Tom Caltabiano, Adam Carolla, Tom Dreesen, David Duchovny, Damien Fahey, Craig Ferguson, Jim Gaffigan, Ana Gasteyer, David Alan Grier, D. L. Hughley, Lisa Joyner, Donal Logue, Rosie Perez, Ahmad Rashad, Jim Rome, Aisha Tyler, and &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; head writer Michael &quot;Gibby&quot; Gibbons culminating in four finalists being involved for week long final tryouts: Craig Ferguson, D. L. Hughley, Damien Fahey, and Michael Ian Black. It was announced on December 7, 2004, that Ferguson, a Scottish comedian best known from his role as Mr. Wick on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, was to become Kilborn&#x27;s permanent replacement. David Letterman later said he made the selection based on the recommendation of Peter Lassally.

Following the conclusion of the on-air auditions on December 3, 2004, guest hosts continued to fill out the roster until the end of the year and included Jason Alexander, Donal Logue, David Alan Grier, Aisha Tyler, Drew Carey, Sara Rue, John Witherspoon, Joe Buck, Susan Sarandon, Don Cheadle, Daryl Mitchell, Bob Saget, Jim Rome, Ana Gasteyer, Damien Fahey, and D.L. Hughley.

===Craig Ferguson (2005–2014)===
Under Craig Ferguson&#x27;s tenure as host, the show started with a cold open, followed by opening credits and a commercial break. A loose comic monologue then followed, consistently including a greeting (&quot;Welcome to Los Angeles, California, welcome to the &quot;Late Late Show&quot;, I am your host, TV&#x27;s Craig Ferguson&quot;) and the proclamation that &quot;It&#x27;s a great day for America, everybody!&quot;.

From 2010 the monologue also included banter with Geoff Peterson, his &quot;robot skeleton sidekick&quot;, voiced and controlled by Josh Robert Thompson. This animatronic was constructed by the MythBusters&#x27; Grant Imahara but went through many revisions, the most important was the regular live control and voicing by Thompson. This changed the dynamic of the show as Ferguson had a recurring &#x27;sidekick&#x27; to banter with.

After another commercial break, the banter continued with Ferguson sitting behind a desk. He usually read and responded to viewer e-mail and (since February 2010) Twitter messages for random responses to viewer questions.

During segments Ferguson occasionally received phone calls (voiced by Thompson) from a variety of characters, including celebrities, the &#x27;very shy&#x27; band (Alfredo Sauce and the Shy Fellas) allegedly hiding behind the set&#x27;s curtain, room service, a duplicate Geoff, and Miriam, a possible stalker who confused Ferguson with former host Craig Kilborn.

Ferguson called his Twitter followers his &quot;robot skeleton army.&quot;

Generally one or two celebrities were interviewed; Ferguson started each by dramatically ripping up note cards written for the interview, &quot;signalling to the audience, and to the guest, that this conversation need not be rigidly managed.&quot; At the end of an interview, Ferguson usually asked his guest to engage in one of various rituals; options included &quot;Awkward Pause&quot;, &quot;Mouth Organ&quot;, &quot;Guess What the Queen is Thinking&quot;, the &quot;Big Cash Prize,&quot; or simply joining Ferguson in throwing Frisbees at the show&#x27;s &quot;horse,&quot; Secretariat (actually two interns dressed in a pantomime horse costume).
Occasionally Craig requested Thompson (as Geoff) to interpret the thoughts of Secretariat or others, in one of a variety of celebrity voices, most notably Morgan Freeman. During a guest appearance, Morgan Freeman described Thompson&#x27;s prompted vocal impression of himself as &quot;impeccable&quot;.

Sometimes the show featured a stand-up comedian or a musical guest, the latter of which is typically pre-taped.

Ferguson incorporated various running gags. Early examples included themed weeks such as &quot;Crab Week&quot;, &quot;Magic Week&quot; and &quot;Shark Week&quot;. Shark Week was apparently a reference to Shark Week on the Discovery Channel, and that channel, saying that Ferguson has always loved Shark Week, scheduled him for an appearance on August 4, 2010. A &quot;photo of Paul McCartney&quot; joke (wherein Ferguson called for a photo of McCartney, which was actually a photo of actress Angela Lansbury and vice versa); the show often used variations of this gag featuring other pairs of look-alike celebrities, such as Cher being shown as Marilyn Manson, and a picture of Ann Coulter being shown whenever Ferguson requested a photo of Tom Petty.

The show ended with &quot;What Did We Learn on the Show Tonight, Craig?&quot;, a segment that started with an animation of a kitten and in which Ferguson &quot;removes his tie, puts his feet on his desk, and summarizes the preceding hour of TV.&quot;
Since the introduction of the Geoff character, Ferguson usually discussed the day&#x27;s lesson with the robot.

Ferguson&#x27;s tenure included the show&#x27;s first high definition broadcast, on August 31, 2009. In March 2010, the &quot;Late Late Show&quot; won the Peabody Award for Excellence in Television for its &quot;Evening with Archbishop Desmond Tutu&quot; episode. According to the Peabody Board, &quot;the Scottish-born Ferguson has made late-night television safe again for ideas.&quot;

The show had Peter Lassally as its executive producer through Ferguson&#x27;s entire tenure. Lassally had previously been executive producer of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

In April 2012, CBS announced that they had reached an agreement with Ferguson to extend his contract through 2014. As part of the deal, the network began co-producing &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; for the first time.

From the beginning of Ferguson&#x27;s tenure as host until August 8, 2012, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; continued to originate from Studio 58 at CBS Television City, as it had dating back to the show&#x27;s origins under Snyder. Ferguson often joked about the studio&#x27;s small size, leaky roof, and poor lighting. On August 27, 2012, the program moved down the hall to the much larger Studio 56. Though the look of the main desk set was similar to the one in Studio 58, the extra space in Studio 56 allowed for more audience seating, a fireplace set for Geoff Peterson, an entrance &amp; monologue set, a musical performance area, as well as a stable set for the show&#x27;s pantomime horse, Secretariat.

====Ferguson&#x27;s departure====
Ferguson&#x27;s contract was set to expire in June 2014. His contract called for him to be first in line to replace David Letterman as host of &quot;The Late Show&quot;. Because CBS chose Stephen Colbert for that position, Ferguson reportedly received a windfall of as much as $10,000,000.

On April 28, 2014, Craig Ferguson announced he would leave &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; at the end of the year. He had reportedly made the decision prior to Letterman&#x27;s announcement but agreed to delay making his own decision public until the reaction to Letterman&#x27;s decision had died down. He had also originally intended to leave in the summer of 2014 but agreed to stay until the end of the year to give CBS more time to find a successor. His last show was December 19, 2014, and began with Ferguson performing &quot;Bang Your Drum&quot; with many of his guests over the years banging drums, including Desmond Tutu. The show featured Jay Leno as Ferguson&#x27;s guest and cameos by Bob Newhart and Drew Carey in the closing segment, a parody of the finales of &quot;Newhart&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;.

===Transition (January–March 2015)===

In the interim between Ferguson&#x27;s departure in December 2014 and James Corden&#x27;s premiere on March 23, 2015, CBS scheduled a number of guest hosts to helm the program. Repeats of Ferguson&#x27;s show finished out 2014. Drew Carey hosted the week of January 5 and did so again the week of March 2, while CBS daytime talk show &quot;The Talk&quot; aired a special week of &quot;The Talk After Dark&quot; episodes on the week of January 12. Other guest hosts included Judd Apatow, Will Arnett, Wayne Brady, Whitney Cummings, Jim Gaffigan, Billy Gardell, Sean Hayes, Thomas Lennon, John Mayer, Kunal Nayyar, Adam Pally, Jim Rome, Lauren Graham, and Regis Philbin. Peter Lassally remained executive producer during this period and retired from television after a six decade career with the taping of Arnett&#x27;s show on February 20, 2015, in which Lassally appeared in a cameo. Shows that aired for the rest of February, into March, had been pre-recorded in January for later broadcast in order to give CBS time to dismantle the Ferguson set and traditional audience seating, and build out a new set and audience arrangement for Corden&#x27;s show. Shows taped by Cummings, Philbin, and Pally originated from New York and were recorded without an audience from Studio 57 at the CBS Broadcast Center, the home studio for &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;. Repeats were to fill out the two weeks between the final new Carey-hosted show on March 6 and the premiere of Corden&#x27;s show on the 23rd.

===James Corden (2015–2023)===

On September 8, 2014, CBS announced that James Corden would succeed Ferguson as host on March 23, 2015. His show, originally slated to premiere on March 9, 2015, was delayed by CBS to March 23, 2015, in December 2014, in order to use the NCAA basketball tournament as a means of promoting Corden&#x27;s debut, and prevent a situation where two episodes would be pre-empted during the first week of the tournament. Corden&#x27;s hosting tenure was the first to have a house band (the lack thereof having been a running joke during Ferguson&#x27;s tenure); Reggie Watts served as the franchise&#x27;s first and only bandleader.

David Letterman&#x27;s contract included the right to control the time slot that follows his and produce the &quot;Late Late Show&quot; and it was his production company, Worldwide Pants, which selected previous hosts. With Letterman&#x27;s departure, CBS became the sole producer of the show. In keeping with customs employed on British chat shows such as &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;, Corden interviewed all of the nightly guests at once, opting for a more conversational style and reducing the format&#x27;s emphasis on U.S. fixtures such as desks and an opening monologue. Many of the show&#x27;s segments, including the recurring Carpool Karaoke (where Corden sang with celebrity guests in a car), became viral videos online, with the show&#x27;s YouTube channel having the second-highest number of subscribers among all associated with American late-night talk shows.

On April 28, 2022, Corden announced that he would step down as host in 2023, stating that &quot;I always thought I’d do it for five years and then leave, and then I stayed on. I’ve really been thinking about it for a long time, thinking whether there might be one more adventure.&quot;

==Retirement and replacement==
In February 2023, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that CBS was considering using Corden&#x27;s departure to reevaluate the future of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; as a franchise, with the network considering alternative formats for the time slot that would be cheaper to produce than a traditional talk show. That month, the network reportedly settled on a Stephen Colbert-produced revival of &quot;@midnight&quot;, a social-media-themed panel show aired by sibling Comedy Central from 2013 through 2017, bringing an end to &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; franchise after 28 years.

Due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, CBS acquired reruns of Byron Allen&#x27;s &quot;Comics Unleashed&quot; in September 2023 to fill the &quot;Late Late Show&quot; time slot in the interim, with a mix of reruns and unaired first-run episodes. In November 2023, CBS officially announced that &quot;After Midnight&quot;, hosted by stand-up comedian Taylor Tomlinson, would premiere on January 16, 2024.

<text>Lana (October 7, 1970 - November, 2016) was a female chimpanzee, the first to use lexigrams in language research. She was born at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University, and the project she was allocated to when 1 year old, the LANguage Analogue project led by Duane Rumbaugh, was named after her with the acronym LANA because the project team felt that her identity was well worth preserving.

==LANA project==
The researchers stated that Lana could discriminate between lexigrams, sequence words grammatically and make novel utterances, demonstrating language learning.

The first LANA project (1971) officially had two Principal Investigators, Rumbaugh and Ernst von Glasersfeld (cf. NIH grants HD-06016 and RR-00165). Ernst von Glasersfeld developed the language that Lana learned to use: he coined the term &quot;lexigram&quot;, created the first 120 of them and designed the grammar that regulated their combination. This artificial language was called Yerkish, in honor of Robert M. Yerkes, the founder of the laboratory within which the LANA project was conceived and conducted.

The early project also had several graduate-student researchers. The prime researcher, and the prime worker with Lana was Dr. Timothy V. Gill. Included in the project were graduate students Gwen Bell Dooley, Beverly Wilkenson, and Michael D. Haberman, among others. Gwen Bell Dooley demonstrated Lana&#x27;s cognitive capability to distinguish between two numerical sets of objects which she then labelled with either &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot;, whichever was requested.

<text>Brian McGuire Cashman (born July 3, 1967) is an American baseball executive for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has served as the general manager and senior vice president of the Yankees since 1998. During Cashman&#x27;s tenure as general manager, he inherited a core that was built by Gene Michael and Bob Watson and the Yankees have won seven American League pennants and four World Series championships.

Cashman began working with the Yankees organization in 1986 as an intern while still in college. He was named assistant general manager in 1992, helping to run the team while owner George Steinbrenner was suspended from baseball. He succeeded Bob Watson as the team&#x27;s general manager in 1998.

==Early life==
Cashman was born in Rockville Centre, New York, and raised in Washingtonville, New York. He was raised in an Irish Catholic family, as the middle of five children born to Nancy and John Cashman. He became a baseball fan at a young age, attending a summer camp hosted by Bucky Dent before starting high school. He grew up as a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers. While visiting his grandmother in Florida, he served as a batboy for the Dodgers during spring training in 1982, with the help of former Dodger Ralph Branca, a family friend.

The Cashman family moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where his father managed Castleton Farm, raising standardbreds for harness racing. Cashman described moving out of Washingtonville before starting high school as &quot;the best thing to happen to [him], to get out of there.&quot;

Cashman attended Lexington Catholic High School before moving to the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Maryland, graduating in 1985. Cashman played baseball and junior varsity basketball at both schools, and added football in his senior year. Brian was classmates with Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and two years after future Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh.

The Catholic University of America offered Cashman the opportunity to play college baseball for the Catholic Cardinals, competing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III, guaranteeing him playing time as a freshman. He was a four-year starter at second base and the team&#x27;s leadoff hitter. He set a school record for most hits in a season, which has since been broken. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree with a major in history in 1989.

==New York Yankees (1986–present)==
George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees, met John Cashman when he managed Pompano Park in Pompano Beach, Florida, and the two became friends. Through another family friend, John helped Brian obtain a position with the Yankees organization as an intern in 1986. He worked in the minor league scouting department in the day, and worked security at night. After Cashman graduated from Catholic, the Yankees offered him a position as a baseball operations assistant, which he accepted.

Steinbrenner was banned from baseball in July 1990 for hiring a gambler to investigate Dave Winfield. Gene Michael, then the Yankees&#x27; general manager, took over daily operations of the Yankees, and Cashman played a role in assisting him. He was promoted to assistant farm director that year, and to major league administrator in 1991. Michael named Cashman an assistant general manager in 1992. He remained in the role after Bob Watson succeeded Michael as general manager in 1995. The Yankees won the 1996 World Series.

===General Manager (1998–present)===
====&quot;Dynastic&quot; years and success (1998–2005)====

In February 1998, Watson resigned from the Yankees, and Cashman was named senior vice-president and general manager. He agreed to a one-year contract for $300,000, and became the second-youngest general manager in MLB history. The Yankees won 114 games during the 1998 season, and won the 1998 World Series. In 1999, Cashman traded fan favorite David Wells to the Toronto Blue Jays to acquire Roger Clemens. The next year, he acquired David Justice, who won the American League Championship Series (ALCS) Most Valuable Player Award for his play in the 2000 ALCS. The Yankees won the 2000 World Series, making Cashman the first general manager to win World Series titles in his first three years. In 2004, Cashman arranged the trade of Alfonso Soriano for Alex Rodriguez.

Despite the team&#x27;s success, Cashman considered leaving the Yankees in 2005 due to conflicts with Steinbrenner and organizational disputes between team officials in New York City and Tampa, Florida. The Washington Nationals were rumored to be interested in hiring Cashman, which would have brought him back to the city where he attended school. Instead, Cashman agreed to a new contract with the Yankees following the conclusion of the 2005 season which gave him more authority in personnel decisions and paid him an average of $1.3 million more over the following three years.

====Another championship (2006–2009)====
With the increased authority, Cashman created a department of professional scouting, and tabbed Billy Eppler as its director. Later, Eppler would move on to become the general manager of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. On September 30, 2008, Cashman signed a three-year contract to stay with the Yankees through the 2011 season. Following the 2008 season, when the Yankees failed to make the playoffs, Cashman signed CC Sabathia, A. J. Burnett, and Mark Teixeira to long-term free agent contracts and traded for Nick Swisher. These four players played a significant role in the 2009 Yankees season, culminating with a victory in the 2009 World Series.

====Post-Championship years and struggles (2010–2016)====
The Yankees went on to make the playoffs again following the 2010 season, but lost to the Texas Rangers in the 2010 American League Championship Series. Following the 2010 season, Cashman held a hard line with Derek Jeter during contract negotiations, reportedly telling Jeter that he would prefer to have Troy Tulowitzki as the Yankees&#x27; starting shortstop, though a deal was eventually made for three years and $45 million.

Yankees ownership agreed to sign Rafael Soriano in January 2011 without Cashman&#x27;s approval. Cashman stated at Soriano&#x27;s introductory press conference that he disagreed with the deal. The Yankees re-signed Cashman to a three-year contract in November 2011.

During 2013, Alex Rodriguez composed a tweet, saying that he had been cleared to play by his doctors after his hip surgery. Cashman was not pleased about the tweet, claiming that the doctors did not give such authority to clear Rodriguez to play after seeking a second opinion with them, causing his faith and relationship with Rodriguez to be alienated. Cashman also wanted to trade Robinson Canó during the 2013 season, reasoning that they would be unable to re-sign him in the next offseason. Ownership prevented Cashman from exploring a trade.

After the 2013 season, the Yankees signed Masahiro Tanaka, Jacoby Ellsbury, Brian McCann, and Carlos Beltrán to contracts that totaled $438 million. However, the Yankees missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year. On October 10, 2014, the Yankees signed Cashman to another three-year deal through the 2017 season. That offseason, Cashman prioritized restructuring the Yankees roster with younger players. He replaced the retired Jeter with Didi Gregorius and also acquired Nathan Eovaldi, both of whom improved during the season. In the 2016 season, he traded Carlos Beltrán to the Texas Rangers, Andrew Miller to the Cleveland Indians, and Aroldis Chapman to the eventual World Series Champion Chicago Cubs to bolster the Yankees farm system.

====&quot;Baby Bombers&quot; Era (2017–present)====
In 2017, the Yankees made the postseason with rookie outfielder Aaron Judge and second-year catcher Gary Sanchez. The Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins in the 2017 American League Wild Card Game, and then went on to defeat the Cleveland Indians in the 2017 American League Division Series. Making their first appearance in the American League Championship Series since 2012, the Yankees lost to the Houston Astros in seven games, far outpacing the expectations of many analysts. Following the season, Cashman recommended to the owner Hal Steinbrenner that a managerial change was needed. &quot;Baseball America&quot; named Cashman their Executive of the Year after the season.

On December 9, Cashman traded second baseman Starlin Castro and two prospects for Marlins outfielder Giancarlo Stanton.

On December 11, 2017, Cashman signed a 5-year, $25 million contract with the Yankees to keep him as general manager through 2022.

The 2018 season saw Cashman and the Yankees win 100 games. Despite a lopsided victory in the AL Wildcard game over the A&#x27;s, New York would fall to their rivals: Boston Red Sox in the Division Series. On April 7, 2019, Cashman won his 2,000th game as the Yankees general manager.

In the 2019 season, the Yankees won 103 games despite having over 30 players on the injured list during the season, with the players accounting over $81 million unable to play at one point of time.

During the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, the Yankees got off to an 8–1 start, and were 16-6 mid-August, before a seven-game losing streak. The team finished both August and September 14–13, which included a 1–7 stretch against the Baltimore Orioles, Toronto Blue Jays, Tampa Bay Rays, and New York Mets, before an 11–2 run, and finished the season 33–27, good for second-place in the East and a spot in the American League Wild Card Series, their 28th consecutive winning season. They won the series 2–0 against the Cleveland Indians, but lost the 2020 American League Division Series three-games-to-two against the Tampa Bay Rays.

In 2021, the Yankees rebounded to win 92 games, behind several winning streaks. Numerous player injuries in the first half of the season contributed to poor offense (through July, the Yankees had the second-lowest number of runs scored in the A.L.). Looking to bolster offensive production, Cashman traded for Anthony Rizzo and Joey Gallo, two strong left-handed batters. Between August 14–27, the team won 13 consecutive games, their longest such streak since 1961. They ended the season on an 8–1 run between September 20–30, but lost two of their final three games, before falling to the Red Sox 6–2 in the Wild Card Game.

The following year, the Yankees finished 99–63, winning the American League East, while star outfielder Aaron Judge broke Roger Maris&#x27;s American League record by hitting 62 home runs. The Yankees defeated the Cleveland Guardians three games to two in the American League Division Series, but were swept by the Houston Astros in the American League Championship Series. During the season, Cashman surpassed Ed Barrow to become the longest-tenured general manager in Yankees history.

On December 5, 2022, the Yankees re-signed Cashman to a four-year contract to remain with the club through the 2026 season. Two days later, the Yankees and Cashman re-signed Aaron Judge to a 9-year, $360 million contract.

==Honors==

Cashman was named to &quot;Crain&#x27;s New York Business 40 under 40&quot; list for 1999. The Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America selected Cashman as their MLB Executive of the Year for 2009. In 2010, Cashman was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame.

Cashman was selected as Baseball Executive of the Year in 2017.

Cashman was also involved in the developing of the video game &quot;MLB Front Office Manager&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cashman lives in Darien, Connecticut. He and his ex-wife, Mary, have two children, Grace and Theodore. Mary filed for divorce in February 2012; they had been reportedly separated for a year. The day prior, prosecutors charged a woman with stalking Cashman in an attempt to extort money regarding an extramarital affair. Cashman is a Kentucky Wildcats and New Jersey Devils fan.

Cashman has referred to himself as an &quot;adrenaline junkie.&quot; In December 2010, Cashman rappelled from a building in Stamford, Connecticut as part of an annual Stamford Christmas celebration. He jumped from an airplane with members of the United States Army Parachute Team to raise awareness for the Wounded Warrior Project and broke his right fibula and dislocated his right ankle in the process. In November 2014, Cashman slept on a New York City sidewalk to raise awareness on behalf of homeless youth.

<text>Crocosmia (), also known as montbretia (), is a small genus of flowering plants in the iris family, Iridaceae. It is native to the grasslands of southern and eastern Africa, ranging from South Africa to Sudan. One species is endemic to Madagascar.

==Description==

They can be evergreen or deciduous perennials that grow from basal underground corms. The alternate leaves are cauline (stem-borne) and ensiform (sword-shaped). The blades are parallel-veined. The margin is entire. The corms form in vertical chains, with the youngest at the top, and oldest and largest buried most deeply in the soil. The roots of the lowermost corm in a chain are contractile roots and drag the corm deeper into the ground where conditions allow. The chains of corms are fragile and easily separated, a quality that has enabled some species to become invasive and difficult to control in the garden.

They have colourful inflorescences of 4 to 20 vivid red and orange alternate flowers on a horizontally divaricate (branched) stem. The terminal inflorescence can have the form of a cyme or a raceme. These flower from early summer well into autumn. The flowers are sessile on a flexuose (zigzag) arched spike. The fertile flowers are hermaphroditic. All stamens have an equal length. The style branches are apically forked. They are pollinated by insects, birds (sunbirds) or by the wind. The dehiscent capsules are shorter than they are wide.

The genus name is derived from the Greek words &quot;krokos&quot;, meaning &quot;saffron&quot;, and &quot;osme&quot;, meaning &quot;odour&quot; – from the dried leaves emitting a strong smell like that of saffron (a spice derived from &quot;Crocus&quot; – another genus belonging to the Iridaceae) when immersed in hot water.

The alternative name montbretia is still widely used, especially for the garden hybrid &quot;C.&quot; × &quot;crocosmiiflora&quot;. &quot;Montbretia&quot; is commonly used in the British Isles for orange-flowered &quot;C.&quot; × &quot;crocosmiiflora&quot; cultivars that have naturalised, while &quot;crocosmia&quot; is reserved for less aggressive red-flowered cultivars. &quot;Montbretia&quot; is also a heterotypic synonym of the genus &quot;Tritonia&quot;, in which some species of &quot;Crocosmia&quot; were once included. It was named by Alire Raffeneau Delile for , a fellow French botanist on Napoleon&#x27;s Egyptian Campaign. 

== Species ==
Species accepted by Kew Plants of the World Online:
* &quot;Crocosmia ambongensis&quot; – Madagascar
* &quot;Crocosmia aurea&quot; (Falling Stars) – eastern + southern Africa from Cape Province to Sudan; naturalised in Azores
* &quot;Crocosmia&quot; × &quot;crocosmiiflora&quot; – South Africa; naturalised in parts of Europe, Rwanda, Zaire, Assam, Norfolk Island in Australia, Fiji, the Caribbean, Argentina, Tristan da Cunha (&quot;C. aurea&quot; × &quot;C. pottsii&quot;)
* &quot;Crocosmia fucata&quot; – Kamiesberg Mountains in Cape Province of South Africa

* &quot;Crocosmia pottsii&quot; (Pott&#x27;s montbretia) – Cape Province, KwaZulu-Natal

=== Garden hybrids ===
* &quot;Crocosmia&quot; × &quot;crocosmiiflora&quot;

==Cultivation==
Crocosmias are grown worldwide, and more than 400 cultivars have been produced. Some hybrids have become invasive, especially &quot;C.&quot; × &quot;crocosmiiflora&quot; hybrids, which are invasive in the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, North Carolina, and the West Coast of the United States.

Crocosmia are winter-hardy in temperate regions. They can be propagated through division, removing offsets from the corm in spring.

24 cultivars possessed the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit in 2023, including:

* &quot;Crocosmia&quot; × &quot;crocosmiiflora&quot; &#x27;Carmin Brillant&#x27;
* &quot;Crocosmia&quot; × &quot;crocosmiiflora&quot; &#x27;Star of the East&#x27;
* &quot;Crocosmia&quot; &#x27;Hellfire&#x27;
* &quot;Crocosmia&quot; &#x27;Lucifer&#x27;
* &quot;Crocosmia&quot; &#x27;Paul&#x27;s Best Yellow&#x27;
* &quot;Crocosmia&quot; &#x27;Severn Sunrise&#x27;

<doc id="1253691" wikidata="Q6009307" url="?curid=1253691" title="In Defense of Women">
<text>In Defense of Women is H. L. Mencken&#x27;s 1918 book on women and the relationship between the sexes. Some laud the book as progressive while others brand it as reactionary. While Mencken did not champion women&#x27;s rights, he described women as wiser in many novel and observable ways, while demeaning average men. 

According to Mencken&#x27;s biographer, Fred Hobson:

:&quot;Depending on the position of the reader, he was either a great defender of women&#x27;s rights or, as a critic labelled him in 1916, &#x27;the greatest misogynist since Schopenhauer&#x27;, &#x27;the country&#x27;s high-priest of woman-haters.&#x27;&quot;

==History==
The original title for &quot;Defense&quot; was &quot;A Book for Men Only&quot;, but other working titles included &quot;The Eternal Feminine&quot; as well as &quot;The Infernal Feminine&quot;. The book was originally published by Philip Goodman in 1918, but Mencken released a new edition in 1922 in an attempt to bring the book to a wider audience. This second edition, published by Alfred Knopf, was both much longer and milder.

==Content==
===General===

In general, biographers describe &quot;Defense&quot; as &quot;ironic&quot;: it was not so much a defense of women as a critique of the relationship between the sexes. Topics covered by the book included &quot;Woman&#x27;s Equipment,&quot; &quot;Compulsory Marriage,&quot; &quot;The Emancipated Housewife,&quot; and &quot;Women as Martyrs.&quot; Women were gaining rights, according to Mencken—the ability to partake in adultery without lasting public disgrace, the ability to divorce men, and even some escape from the notion of virginity as sacred, which remained as &quot;one of the hollow conventions of Christianity.&quot; Women nonetheless remained restrained by social conventions in many capacities.

===Suffrage===

Mencken&#x27;s love of women was driven in part by the sympathy he had for female literary characters (especially those brought to life by his friend Theodore Dreiser), as well as his almost fanatical love of his mother. Mencken supported women&#x27;s rights, even if he had no affection for the suffragist.

Although he originally intended to be ironic when he proclaimed that women were the superior gender, many of the qualities he assigned to them were qualities he deeply admired – realism and skepticism among them, but also manipulative skill and a detached view of humankind.

===&quot;Demeaning&quot;===

Mencken praised women, though he believed they should remain in the background of industry and politics. In personal letters especially, Mencken would write that women should appreciate men and do their best to support them. Although Mencken did not intend to demean women, his description of his &quot;ideal scene&quot; with a woman in the 1922 edition was not conventionally progressive:

Mencken often espoused views of politics, religion, and metaphysics that stressed their grotesqueness and absurdity; in this context, escape from the supposed fraud of such somber subjects was welcome to him.

==Critical reviews==
The book was reviewed very well: according to Carl Bode, there were four times as many favorable reviews as unfavorable. 

The first edition of the book sold fewer than 900 copies, a disappointing showing. The second edition sold much better, during the more progressive Roaring Twenties.

<text>Armand Anthony Assante Jr. (; born October 4, 1949) is an American actor. He played mobster John Gotti in the 1996 HBO television film &quot;Gotti&quot;, Odysseus in the 1997 miniseries adaptation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, Nietzsche in &quot;When Nietzsche Wept&quot;, and Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer in 1982&#x27;s &quot;I, the Jury&quot;. He has been nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards (one win for his performance in &quot;Gotti&quot;), four Golden Globe Awards, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards.

==Early life==
Assante was born in New York City and raised in Cornwall, New York, the son of Armand Anthony Assante Sr., a painter and artist, and Katharine (née Healy), a music teacher, English teacher and poet. He is of Italian and Irish descent.

==Career==
During the 1970s, Assante was a regular on two NBC soap operas, &quot;How to Survive a Marriage&quot; as Johnny McGhee and &quot;The Doctors&quot; as Mike Powers. His first film was &quot;The Lords of Flatbush&quot; (1974), although his work did not appear in the final cut of the film and the end credits misspelled his last name as Assanti. He starred in &quot;Prophecy&quot; (1979). His first on-screen role was playing Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s brother in &quot;Paradise Alley&quot;, and a role that brought him greater attention came in 1980&#x27;s &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; as a handsome Frenchman who becomes the love interest of a U.S. soldier played by Goldie Hawn. In 1984 he portrayed the playboy violin virtuoso Maximillian Stein in the Dudley Moore comedy vehicle &quot;Unfaithfully Yours&quot;.

Assante has played a number of tough hero characters, such as his starring role as private eye Mike Hammer in the film &quot;I, the Jury&quot; (1982) as well as Mafia gangsters such as Michael Moretti in &quot;Sidney Sheldon&#x27;s Rage of Angels&quot;. In 1990 his role as Roberto Texador in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s film &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; garnered him a Golden Globe nomination, and the following year he portrayed Bugsy Siegel in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Marrying Man&quot; (1991). The following year he was seen as mafia boss Carol D&#x27;Allesandro in &quot;Hoffa&quot; (1992) starring Jack Nicholson, and crime kingpin John Gotti in the 1996 made-for-television biopic &quot;Gotti&quot;, for which he won his Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.

In addition to mafia and &quot;tough-guy&quot; roles, Assante has appeared in historical dramas, such as Napoleon Bonaparte in 1987&#x27;s &quot;Napoleon and Josephine: A Love Story&quot; opposite Jacqueline Bisset, the heroic Odysseus in &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, Friedrich Nietzsche in the film adaptation of Irving Yalom&#x27;s novel &quot;When Nietzsche Wept&quot;, and as Sanchez, Queen Isabella&#x27;s Minister of State, in &quot;1492: Conquest of Paradise&quot;.

Other film appearances include one as a Cuban bandleader in &quot;The Mambo Kings&quot; opposite Antonio Banderas and in the adaptation of the science-fiction story &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; with Sylvester Stallone, his co-star in &quot;Paradise Alley&quot;. He appeared in the 2007 film &quot;American Gangster&quot; with Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. He had a recurring guest star role in several episodes of &quot;NCIS&quot;, playing the international arms dealer René Benoit. He has also appeared in the 2009 horror film &quot;Smile&quot; as the mysterious Tollinger and portrayed Ernie in &quot;Sugar&quot; (marketed on Lifetime as &quot;Danger Below Deck&quot;). Outside of the U.S., he has participated in several film projects and humanitarian endeavors in Romania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.

==Personal life==
Assante had a high-profile relationship with Dyan Cannon, his co-star from 1978&#x27;s &quot;Lady of the House&quot;. He married Karen McArn in 1982. The couple had two daughters: Anya (born 1983) and Alesandra (born 1988). They separated in 1992. It is not clear whether or when they divorced. Assante has also dated Mara Venier and Vanessa Constantino.

In 2013, Assante became a partner in his own premium cigar brand known as Ora Vivo Cigars.

<text>Marion L. Bloom (1891 – March 10, 1975) was an American writer and nurse, and briefly a literary agent, known for her nearly decade-long relationship with H. L. Mencken.

==Life==
Bloom was born in New Windsor, Maryland. She was one of eight children, with five brothers and two sisters.

When Bloom was seven, she lost her father to suicide, prompting her older siblings to seek employment to support the family. As a teenager, Bloom moved to Washington, D.C. to find work as a writer. In February 1914, she met H. L. Mencken in Washington, D.C. Shortly after this, the two became romantically involved. Mencken would travel to visit her in Washington, D.C., and Bloom visited him in New York City. Bloom worked as a nurse for six months in the United States Army in Europe during World War I. Upon returning to the United States, she converted to Christian Science. Mencken, an atheist, believed that Bloom&#x27;s faith was a hindrance upon their marriage.

In 1923, Bloom briefly married Lou Maritza, a Romanian historian. which pushed Mencken to destroy her letters to him. Later, Bloom moved to France. By the time she returned to the United States, Mencken had married the terminally ill Sara Haardt in 1930, who died four years later.

According to Fred Hobson, Bloom was &quot;an interesting character in her own right, a compelling figure not because she was special in any way, but because she was emblematic of the prototypical small-town girl, emerging from hardship, poverty and religious piety, who went to the city to pursue her own idea of the American Dream. Bloom was never fully able to determine what version of that dream she wanted most — whether to succeed as a new woman, self-reliant professionally and emotionally, or whether to play a more traditional role and become the wife of a powerful man such as H. L. Mencken. She could not easily, in her time, have both, and she ended up having neither.&quot;

== Work ==
Edward A. Martin&#x27;s book, &quot;In Defense of Marion,&quot; discusses the significance of the relationship between Bloom and Mencken, describing it as &quot;the most important love relationship in H. L. Mencken’s life.&quot; Martin suggests that Mencken attempted to conceal this relationship, hoping it would remain hidden within the extensive documentation of his literary accomplishments as an author and editor. Martin observes that their relationship thrived during a time when Mencken frequently addressed women&#x27;s issues in his writings.

Her association with H. L. Mencken commenced in February 1914, during her visit to the premises of the Baltimore Sun. Although Mencken and Bloom&#x27;s relationship ended in the early 1920s, their exchange of love letters later shows Bloom&#x27;s lasting admiration for Mencken. Their love letters were published in 1996 in &quot;&quot;In Defense of Marion: The Love of Marion Bloom and H. L. Mencken&quot;.&quot;

Bloom authored several books and wrote for &quot;American Mercury&quot; and &quot;The Washington Herald&quot;. She also returned to the nursing field, working for the American Red Cross as assistant chief of the Resources Information unit. It is believed that she may have served in the army again as a nurse during and after World War II, from 1944 until 1947. She worked for the Junior Red Cross in the late 1940s and was employed by the State Department in 1950, retiring ten years later. She died on March 10, 1975.

The correspondences between Mencken, Bloom, and her sister Estelle are housed at the Enoch Pratt Free Library of Baltimore and the New York Public Library.

<doc id="1253707" wikidata="Q2000214" url="?curid=1253707" title="Gary Sprake">
<text>Gareth Sprake (3 April 1945 – 18 October 2016) was a Welsh professional footballer. A goalkeeper, he played for Leeds United and Birmingham City and also won 37 caps for Wales.

Sprake became known during his career as a brilliant goalkeeper who was prone to occasional mistakes. He was especially known for his ability to come out to catch crossed balls floating into the box and his shot stopping. At Leeds, Sprake played 504 times, keeping more than 200 clean sheets. He spent more than a decade as the number 1 keeper at Leeds during a period when they were a dominant side in the English domestic game.

==Club career==
Sprake represented Swansea Schoolboys and was noticed by Leeds United soon after he left school and was playing for a local works team.

Sprake joined Leeds as an apprentice, and made a last-minute debut in 1962 when the regular goalkeeper went down with a stomach complaint on the day of a game at Southampton. Over the next two seasons Sprake became a regular as Leeds won the Second Division in 1964, and then challenged for the Football League championship title and FA Cup double the following year. Sprake only missed one game in both competitions that season, but Leeds ended with nothing, missing out on the League title on goal average to Manchester United and losing the FA Cup final to Liverpool. At Leeds, he was also known to be sick before each match but managed to play regularly and keep the starting goalkeeper position.

The first of Sprake&#x27;s two notorious errors came in 1967 when Leeds played Liverpool in a League game at Anfield. Sprake was holding the ball and was set to throw it to the Leeds left back Terry Cooper, only to curtail his throw when he spotted Liverpool winger Ian Callaghan running towards the area he planned to throw the ball. Unfortunately for Sprake, the ball slipped out of his hands behind him and ended up in the net. At half-time, the Liverpool tannoy-announcer played &quot;Careless Hands&quot;, a record by Des O&#x27;Connor, apparently in reference to Sprake&#x27;s mistake, and during the second half Liverpool supporters on the Kop sang the song repeatedly to Sprake. During his time at Leeds, fans of rival clubs gave Sprake the nickname &quot;Careless Hands&quot; as a result.

In the same season Sprake kept a clean sheet as Leeds beat Arsenal in the League Cup final, and he performed heroics behind an overworked defence as Leeds won the Fairs Cup, the club&#x27;s first European honour. In 1969, Sprake was again a regular as Leeds won the League championship.

In 1970, Sprake and Leeds chased a treble of the League, the FA Cup and the European Cup, but ended up with nothing. The League title went to Everton who won by nine points, and Leeds went out of the European Cup in the semi-finals to Celtic. The FA Cup Final provided the stage for the second of Sprake&#x27;s most memorable errors.

In the 1970 FA Cup Final, Leeds were playing Chelsea and took an early lead through Jack Charlton. Chelsea chased an equaliser, but when attacking midfield player Peter Houseman hit a left foot shot shortly before the break, it seemed tame and directionless enough for Sprake to save it safely. Sprake dived full length to save it but it squirmed through his grasp and rolled into the net. At the time, the Wembley surface was in poor condition, with the stadium having hosted the Horse of the Year Show days earlier and having much of the grass turned into hard turf lumps as a result, as well as the presence of a vast covering of sand.

In the second half, Mick Jones put Leeds ahead with just six minutes to go, but Chelsea again equalized. Sprake suffered a knee injury and was replaced by David Harvey in the replay, which Chelsea won 2–1.

Sprake was still the first-choice keeper for Leeds in the following two seasons, but was replaced by Harvey at the tail of both, including the 1972 FA Cup Final. Sprake watched from the sidelines as Leeds defeated Arsenal 1–0 in 1972 with a goal from Allan Clarke and a superb performance by Harvey at the other end. In the same year, due to his need of first-team football, Sprake publicly criticised Revie for his treatment of him and so his relationship with his manager, teammates, and the Leeds supporters soured. He only played once in the 1972–73 season, missed two more Cup finals, and eventually left for Birmingham City for £100,000 (breaking the world record transfer fee for a goalkeeper in the process) to play first-team football and regain his place in the Welsh team.

==International career==

Sprake was the youngest-ever goalkeeper to appear for Wales when he made his international debut as an 18-year-old against Scotland on 20 November 1963.

Sprake won 37 caps for Wales between 1963 and 1974.

==Retirement==
A back injury brought Sprake&#x27;s career to an end at the age of 30, the injury resulting from a near fatal blood clot in his back which forced him to undergo spinal fusion surgery. His back problems were largely blamed on regular injections of cortisone he was given during his early career at Leeds. After retiring, he underwent seven operations on his back. Sprake worked as a salesman for a short period before becoming a borough council training officer in Solihull, where he remained for over 14 years. His biography, &quot;Careless Hands: The Forgotten Truth of Gary Sprake&quot; by Tim Johnson and Stuart Sprake (his nephew), was published in 2006. In November 2009, he was given an award by the Football Association of Wales for his contribution to Welsh football during the 1960s and 1970s.

In 1978, Sprake was paid a substantial fee by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; to make allegations against former Leeds manager Don Revie and club captain Billy Bremner regarding match-fixing, though no charges ever arose from his accusations. Allegations centred on the match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Leeds at Molineux on 8 May 1972. It was the final match of the 1971–72 season and Leeds needed one point to win the league title. They lost 2–1 and the title went to Derby County. The paper alleged that Revie and Bremner had tried to bribe Danny Hegan, a Wolves player, before the match. In 1982, Bremner sued for libel in the High Court and was awarded damages of £100,000. Among witnesses who supported Bremner was Wolves&#x27; Derek Dougan, who asserted that he &quot;never heard any Leeds player, or anyone else connected with them, offer bribes&quot;. Sprake, who said in court that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t remember&quot; Bremner offering a bribe, later claimed that the &quot;Mirror&quot; paid him £7,500.

Paul Harrison, one of Bremner&#x27;s biographers writing in 2010, remembered Sprake as a rude and arrogant individual whose attitude was in sharp contrast to the friendliness and approachability of Revie, Bremner, and many other Leeds players. Harrison quoted Bremner saying of Sprake that he should have &quot;tried harder&quot; and &quot;concentrated more&quot; on improving his game because, &quot;instead of believing he was the best, he would then have made a decent keeper&quot;. Bremner made it clear that he had little respect for Sprake because of &quot;things he has done in his life&quot;, and pointed out that, among professional footballers, Sprake was &quot;not one of the wisest or most respected&quot;. Bremner acknowledged that Sprake was capable of pulling off some &quot;unbelievable&quot; saves, before adding that this was &quot;as positive as I can get about the man&quot;. Bremner went on to say what he thought about twelve other Leeds players and, in every case, his comments were very positive. Comparing Sprake with David Harvey, Bremner said Harvey was the better goalkeeper because he was reliable.

Sprake died at the age of 71 on 18 October 2016.

<text>Kevin Alastair Kyle (born 7 June 1981) is a Scottish retired footballer and media personality who played as a centre forward. He played for eleven senior clubs in his career. Kyle gained ten full Scotland international caps and scored one goal.

After starting as a youngster at Ayr United, Kyle began his professional career with Sunderland, where he had been in the youth team. He remained at the Stadium of Light for six years, making 91 appearances in the Football League, scoring 17 goals. He also made his debut for both the Scotland under−21s and its senior team during his time in the North East, as well as gaining promotion to the Premier League in 2004–05. In 2006, he moved to Coventry City, for whom he made 44 league appearances and scored five goals. In 2009, Kyle signed for Kilmarnock, marking his professional debut in his homeland. After a year in East Ayrshire, during which he scored 16 goals, he signed for Hearts in 2010. In two years at Tynecastle, Kyle scored seven goals in his 19 league appearances. In 2012, Kyle joined Rangers, where he made eight league appearances and scored three goals, and won the Third Division title as the club began its climb back to top tier. He finished his career back at Ayr United in 2013, aged 32, and retired the following year.

==Early life==
Kyle was born and grew up in Stranraer, Scotland where as well as playing for his school team and local amateur sides he was selected to play for Dumfries and Galloway region. Also in the same Dumfries and Galloway team was fellow Stranraer boy Allan Jenkins.

==Playing career==

===Sunderland===
Kyle began his career as a youth at Ayr United before joining Sunderland in 1998, where he was a prolific scorer for their reserves. However, he was unable to force his way into a first team that boasted the striking talent of Kevin Phillips and Niall Quinn. Instead, he gained first team experience on loan with Huddersfield, Darlington and Rochdale. It was on loan at Darlington that Kyle scored his first career goals, notching against Sudbury in the FA Cup and Mansfield Town in the league.

After finally breaking into the Sunderland first team in the 2003–04 season he ended up as their joint top goalscorer with 16 goals to help them to the play-offs. However, he missed most of the following season owing to a hip injury and his recovery was aided by visits to Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt and American hip surgeon Marc Phillipon. He returned to first team action in February 2006, scoring his first and only Premier League goal in March 2006, away to Manchester City, in a season that saw Sunderland relegated on a then-record low points tally.

===Coventry City===
Kyle then joined Coventry City on 25 August 2006 for £600,000, but only went on to score three goals during the campaign. He scored just two more. Out of favour with the Sky Blues and despised by their fans, he traded a relegation battle with Coventry for a promotion push with a loan to fellow Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers during the latter half of the 2007–08 season, reuniting him with his former Sunderland boss Mick McCarthy. He made 13 appearances, nine as substitute, scoring once against Crystal Palace. While Wolves finished seventh, outside the play-offs, his move was not made permanent as Kyle said he would rather return to Coventry, who finished a point clear of the relegation positions in 21st, in the summer. After failing to feature at all during the opening stages of the next season for his parent club, he joined Hartlepool United on a month&#x27;s loan on 1 October 2008. The loan was later extended until the end of the year, and Kyle scored five goals in 15 starts.

===Kilmarnock===
On 27 January 2009, Coventry announced that they had reached an agreement with Kyle over the remaining six months of his contract, and he had left the club by mutual consent. Two days later, he signed for Kilmarnock on an 18-month contract. On 31 January 2009 he scored a headed goal on his debut for Kilmarnock against St Mirren and this goal was also the first at the new St Mirren Park. On 11 April he scored all three goals, his first ever professional hat-trick, in a 3–0 victory against Falkirk for which he received a standing ovation when he was substituted. Kyle was praised for his part in keeping Killie in the SPL that season. In the games following the 2008–2009 season Scottish Premier League split, Kyle scored all of Kilmarnock&#x27;s goals in a draw with Falkirk and victories against St Mirren and Inverness Caledonian Thistle thus helping the team secure 8th place and SPL survival. He scored eight goals in total that season.

Kyle was made Kilmarnock club captain for the 2009–10 season. He started where he left off by scoring twice in the opening day 3–0 home victory over Hamilton and his good form won him a recall to the Scotland squad after an absence of five years. In the Scottish League Cup game against Morton (in which he also scored) he suffered a knee injury, sidelining him for three weeks and causing him to miss the final two World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and the Netherlands on 5 and 10 September 2009. In January 2010, he relinquished the club captaincy following his involvement in the events that ultimately led to the departure of manager Jim Jefferies.

Kyle became unhappy at Kilmarnock and went on trial with Russian side PFC Spartak Nalchik with a view to join them at the end of the season when his current deal expired but rejected a move. Whilst playing in a trial match there he picked up an injury, angering manager Calderwood as he missed key games for the club.

===Hearts===
Kyle signed a two-year contract with Hearts on 3 June 2010, which reunited him with Jim Jefferies, making his debut on 14 August 2010 against St Johnstone as a 66th-minute substitute. His first goal for the club came the following week against Hamilton in Hearts 4–0 win. He took over taking penalty kicks at the club and scored six goals out of six from the spot, plus another four from open play, in the 2010–11 season. He scored a late winner in the Edinburgh derby against Hibernian on 1 January 2011. The remainder of his 2010–11 season was blighted by a hip injury, as Kyle made his last appearance of the season on 11 January. The injury continued to trouble Kyle in the 2011–12 season. After several setbacks Kyle admitted that he feared this could be the end of his footballing career. Kyle underwent a further operation on his hip in January 2012, but was released from his contract in March 2012.

===Rangers===
Kyle was initially invited back to train with Hearts during the 2012–13 pre-season however this fell through following the departure of manager Paulo Sérgio. He began training with Dunfermline and featured for them as a trialist during their pre-season friendlies. He then joined St Johnstone on trial. After revealing he would be open to a move to Rangers, Kyle accepted an invite to take part in one of their training sessions. On 7 August 2012, Kyle signed a one-year contract with Rangers. Kyle made his Rangers debut on the same day as signing as a substitute at home to East Fife in the League Cup first round. On 16 March 2013, Kyle left the club by mutual consent.

===Ayr United===
Kyle started training with Ayr in late August 2013, and soon began playing in reserve games. He made his debut, although as a trialist, after being subbed on in a 1–1 draw at Stenhousemuir. Kyle played one more game before finally signing a contract, which was held up due to financial constraints, that lasted until January 2014.

==International career==
Kyle has represented Scotland at under-21, and at full international level making ten appearances scoring once, against a Hong Kong League XI during the HKSAR Reunification Cup in May 2002. His last call up was for a friendly against the Faroe Islands in November 2010.

==Personal life==
Kyle is married to Lynn. He has four sons; Max, Harry, Danny and Tom. 
. His brother-in-law is fellow Stanraer native Jamie Adams.

In 2007, he was convicted of two breaches of the peace after a brawl in Stranraer.

After retiring, Kyle worked in the Shetland Islands for two years, doing 18-day stints of 12-hour shifts as a room-keeper on the MS &quot;Regina Baltica&quot; cruiseferry. &quot;Life was pretty shit,&quot; he said. At a Clyde F.C. training camp, he met Simon Ferry, who asked him if he&#x27;d like to come on his &quot;Keeping the Ball on the Ground&quot; podcast.

== Media career ==
In 2018, Kyle was interviewed by Simon Ferry on the YouTube channel Open Goal. &quot;I did the interview and I thought, &#x27;This could be quite good.&#x27; I don&#x27;t know how to filter things and just say things how it is.&quot; After returning to the channel for a few appearances, Kyle became a permanent fixture on the channel, regularly featuring on the channel&#x27;s podcast with Ferry and Paul Slane, as well as Andy Halliday later on. The show has gained a large cult following, and Open Goal was awarded &#x27;Best Podcast&#x27; at the 2019 Football Blogging Awards.

<text>This is a summary of 2002 in music in the United Kingdom.

==Summary==
British and Irish bands that did well in the charts included Stereophonics, the Chemical Brothers, and Westlife; the latter topped the charts for a record 10th time, matching Madonna. They also were the quickest act to obtain 10 chart toppers, with only 35 months between this and their first.

The fastest-selling debut single in UK chart history was released by the Winner of the TV talent show, &quot;Pop Idol&quot;; Will Young had been voted as the winner by over 4 million people in the final, after winning six out of the nine weeks, with Gareth Gates, the eventual runner-up, winning three times. &quot;Anything is Possible/Evergreen&quot;, topped the charts for 3 weeks and sold over 1.1 million copies in its first week of sale; altogether it sold over 1.7 million copies, becoming the 11th biggest-selling single in the UK and also the second fastest-selling single in the UK, with only Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; ahead of it. Young reached the top again with his second single &quot;Light My Fire&quot;.

Runner-up Gareth Gates scored a No. 1 with his debut single, &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, spending one week more at the top than Will Young, thought the single itself sold less than Will Young&#x27;s; nonetheless it became the 77th million-selling single in the UK and the last one until 2004. Overall, it is the 37th biggest selling single in the UK. Gates also had a second No.1 single, &quot;Anyone Of Us (Stupid Mistake)&quot;, which topped the charts for 3 weeks, bettering Will Young by one week once again. Darius Danesh, third in &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, also made No 1 with &quot;Colourblind&quot;. After both having two chart toppers, Young and Gates joined forces and revived an old Beatles classic, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;.

UK girl group Sugababes (who were now under their second line-up of original members Keisha Buchanan, Mutya Buena and former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range, who replaced Siobhán Donaghy after her departure the previous year) scored their first UK number one with &quot;Freak like Me&quot;. Ronan Keating also returned to the top of the singles chart with a cover of &quot;If Tomorrow Never Comes&quot;. Liberty X, consisting of the five losers who just failed to make Hear&#x27;Say in the talent show &quot;Popstars&quot;, reached No. 1 with &quot;Just a Little&quot;, eventually becoming more successful than Hear&#x27;Say, who disbanded in October. S Club Juniors, an 8-piece pre-teen spin off from S Club 7 (who saw the departure of band member Paul Cattermole earlier that year) reached No 2 with their debut single &quot;One Step Closer&quot;.

The Sugababes hit the top for a second time with their sixth single, &quot;Round Round&quot;. Like their first No. 1 single, it only spent a week at the summit. The song was taken from the soundtrack to the hit film, &quot;The Guru&quot;. Specialising in pop and R&amp;B with garage influences, all-male act Blazin&#x27; Squad entered atop the charts with their massively hyped debut single, &quot;Crossroads&quot;. They would go on to have five more top 10 singles, though their two albums charted near the low end of the top 40 on the albums chart.

Coldplay released their second album, a follow-up to &quot;Parachutes&quot;; &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; included several hit singles and they became one of the few early 2000s era British acts to achieve fame and popularity in the US. Having 
previously topped the singles charts twice, Atomic Kitten also scored a No. 1 album with their third release, &quot;Feels So Good&quot;, which spawned two top 3 hits as well as their 3rd chart topper.

Twelve months after topping the charts with his debut single, Daniel Bedingfield returned with a slow ballad, &quot;If You&#x27;re Not The One&quot;. It became his 2nd UK No. 1, and his debut album, &quot;Gotta Get Thru This&quot;, produced five Top 10 singles and six Top 40 hits. Boy band Blue reached the top of the UK charts for the third time, collaborating with Elton John to revive an old hit of his, &quot;Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word&quot;.

A notable charity single that reached the top 20 was &quot;Nothing Sacred – A Song for Kirsty&quot; by Russell Watson. The campaign raised money for the Francis House Children&#x27;s Hospital, and was inspired by Kirsty Howard, an eight-year old with a rare heart condition. The song peaked at number 17 and sales contributed to the £5million target for the Kirsty Appeal achieved in 2006.

&quot;&quot; became the new phenomenon in the world of talent shows, producing two new acts, boy band One True Voice and girl group Girls Aloud. They both released their singles in Christmas week and the girls beat the boys to the top spot, claiming the Christmas number one with &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;. Robbie Williams took the Christmas number one album spot yet again with his fifth No. 1 album, &quot;Escapology&quot;.

<doc id="1253723" wikidata="Q7073558" url="?curid=1253723" title="Oak Hill (James Monroe house)">
<text>Oak Hill is a mansion and plantation located in Aldie, Virginia that was for 22 years a home of Founding Father James Monroe, the fifth U.S. President. It is located approximately south of Leesburg on U.S. Route 15, in an unincorporated area of Loudoun County, Virginia. Its entrance is north of Gilberts Corner, the intersection of 15 with U.S. Route 50. It is a National Historic Landmark, but privately owned and not open to the public.

==History==

The main mansion of the property was constructed in 1822 for James Monroe, who subsequently split time between this estate and another home at Monroe Hill on the grounds of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia after his term as the nation&#x27;s fifth president. Oak Hill was Monroe&#x27;s only residence for three years, from 1827 to 1830, and it was one of his residences during 22 years. The mansion was built in 1820, during Monroe&#x27;s presidency. Before that, Monroe&#x27;s residence at the estate was the clapboard building known in recent years as the Monroe Cottage.

The architecture is distinctive for &quot;its unusual pentastyle portico&quot;. It is suggested that Thomas Jefferson, his close friend, may well have drawn plans for Oak Hill; the construction was supervised by James Hoban, designer and builder of the White House. Aside from the main house, other structures remaining from Monroe&#x27;s time include the cottage, a smokehouse, springhouse, blacksmith&#x27;s shop, a square barn, the stone Stallion Barn, and possibly the Brick House. The estate is a designated U.S. National Historic Landmark.

==Purchase==
Monroe and his uncle Joseph Jones jointly purchased 4,400 acres (18 km2) of land in Loudoun County in 1794. When Jones died without direct heirs in 1805, Monroe gained sole possession of the property. However, Monroe continued to live primarily at Highland, his residence in Albemarle County—until 1826, when he was forced to sell that property to pay debts he had incurred while serving as president.

==Attempted sale==
Monroe had put Oak Hill on the market in 1809, and placed an advertisement in &quot;The Washingtonian&quot; on December 23 of that year:

He also attempted to sell the land in 1825, but failed to receive an acceptable bid both times.

==Retirement==
In 1822, Monroe began construction on the main house, a two-story brick mansion in the Federal style. He hired James Hoban, the designer of the White House, to serve as architect. Monroe&#x27;s longtime friend and political mentor Thomas Jefferson offered many design suggestions.

Monroe and his wife, Elizabeth Kortright Monroe, retired to Oak Hill after he finished his second term as president in 1825. In August 1825, the Marquis de Lafayette and President John Quincy Adams were guests of the Monroes there. Elizabeth Monroe died at Oak Hill on September 23, 1830. After her death, Monroe moved to New York City to live with his younger daughter and remained there until his own death on July 4, 1831.

After Monroe&#x27;s death, the property passed out of the Monroe family. John W. Fairfax, later a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate States Army, bought Oak Hill in 1852. His wife remained there while Fairfax was away fighting in the American Civil War; it was visited by General George G. Meade of the Union Army on the invitation of Mrs. Fairfax about a week prior to the Battle of Gettysburg. The property passed out of the hands of John Fairfax after the war, but was later repurchased by his eldest son, Henry, a civil engineer and state senator. The estate remained in the Fairfax family until after Henry Fairfax&#x27;s death in 1916. The mansion was enlarged by the addition of two wings in 1922 while owned by Frank C. Littleton and his wife, but the central facade looks much as it did during Monroe&#x27;s lifetime. The property remains in private hands today and is not open to the public. It became the residence of Tom and Gayle DeLashmutt and their family following the death of the previous owner, Eugene Reed Prendergast, Mr. DeLashmutt&#x27;s mother, in 1993.

Two U.S. Navy ships have been named USS &quot;Oak Hill&quot; after the estate.

==Potential museum==
In November 2023, the owners of Oak Hill sent a letter to Charles F. Sams III, Director of the National Park Service, requesting the agency to &quot;explore the suitability of designating Oak Hill, the former home of President James Monroe located in Loudoun County, Virginia, as a unit of the National Park System.&quot; If successful, the goal would be to transform the house into a museum by the United States Semiquincentennial in 2026.

<doc id="1253725" wikidata="Q11046720" url="?curid=1253725" title="Draculin">
<text>Draculin (named after Count Dracula) is a glycoprotein found in the saliva of vampire bats. It is a single-chain polypeptide protein composed of 708 amino acids, weighing about 88.5 kDa when reduced and 83 kDa when non-reduced, and selectively inhibits FIXa and FXa. It functions as an anticoagulant, inhibiting coagulation factors IX (IXa) and X (Xa) by establishing rapid equilibrium with factor Xa, and is the first natural polypeptide which has been described to show immediate anti-IXa and anti-Xa properties. In addition, Draculin inhibits the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, preventing fibrinogen from converting to fibrin. These two processes inhibit blood coagulation thus keeping the blood of the bitten victim from clotting while the bat is drinking. The activation of factor X is a common point between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. Activated factor X (FXa) is the sole enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of prothrombine into thrombin, which is vital in the coagulation cascade. Draculin is a member of the Lactoferrin family of proteins that functions as an antibacterial protein in other mammals, but has been co-opted in bat evolution to function as an anticoagulant.

Draculin is a noncompetitive, tight-binding inhibitor of FXa. The inhibition upon contact with the blood of the victim is immediate. Draculin forms equimolar complexes with factor FXa. The formation of draculin-factor Xa is a two-stage process. The first reversible stage is characterized by the following constants: k1 = 1.117*106 M-1*sec-1, k-1 = 15.388*10-1 sec-1. The second irreversible (concentration-independent) stage is characterized by the forward reaction rate constant k2 = 0.072 sec-1. The dissociation constant is determined as the ratio k-1/k1 = 13.76 nM. Because of the immediate inhibition, the reaction is not readily reversible initially, but is a reversible reaction. It does not act on thrombin, trypsin or chymotrypsin and does not express fibrinolytic activity. The protein increases the lag phase as well as the height of the peak of thrombin generation when in plasma, leading to prolonged bleeding. The biological activity of Draculin is highly dependent on glycosylation of the native protein and can be severely affected by the salivation pattern of the animals. 

Daily salivation of vampire bats yields a saliva that progressively decreases in anticoagulant activity. However, there is no significant change in overall protein content during this time. After a 4-day period of rest, anticoagulant activity of the saliva is restored. In addition, purified native draculin, obtained from high- and low-activity saliva, shows significant differences in composition of the carbohydrate moiety, and glycosylation pattern. Furthermore, controlled chemical de-glycosylation of native draculin progressively leads to complete loss of the biological activity, despite the conditions leaving the polypeptide backbone intact. These results suggest that oligosaccharides linked to draculin are essential for it to express against Fxa. In addition, it suggests that draculin is actually secreted as a mixture of glycoforms. The final anticoagulant activity of draculin then, in turn, relies on correct glycosylation, implying that glycosylation is the limiting step for production of draculin with optimal anticoagulant properties. In this regard, the appropriate glycosylation of draculin may be in part responsible for the dual, independent, inhibitory action of native draculin on FIXa and FXa, suggesting a novel mechanism of inhibition which is different from other known natural inhibitors of FXa.

== Structure ==
Draculin is a single-chain protein composed of 708 amino acids, weighing about 83 kDa with a pI of 4.1-4.2. When reduced, the gel electrophoresis data indicates a slightly higher molecular mass suggesting intra-chain disulphide bonds.

There are two different structural forms of draculin. However, the two forms do not significantly differ from the other. Both structures are able to and do bind to coagulation factors IXa and Xa. The main difference is evident in inhibition activity. One structural form will inhibit factor IXa and the other Xa. The inhibitory activity of one factor is not affected by the presence of the other. FXa-Draculin complex is a two-step mechanism that, through experimental conditions, is reversible.

<text>Gunnar Wennerberg (2 October 1817 – 24 August 1901) was a Swedish poet, composer and politician.

==Biography==
Wennerberg was the son of the vicar of the town of Lidköping in Västergötland, went to &quot;gymnasium&quot; in the cathedral town of Skara, and matriculated as a student at Uppsala University in 1837, where he studied natural sciences, Classical philology, Philosophy and Aesthetics. He received his filosofie magister degree in 1845 and became a docent of Aesthetics in 1846.
Wennerberg was remarkable in several ways, handsome in face and tall in figure, with a finely trained singing voice, and brilliant in wit and conversation. From the outset of his career he was accepted in the inner circle of men of light and leading for which the university was at that time famous. In 1843 he became a member of the musical club who called themselves The Juvenals, and for their meetings were written the trios and duets, music and words, which Wennerberg began to publish in 1846. In the following year appeared the earliest numbers of &quot;Gluntarne&quot; (or &quot;The Boys&quot;), thirty duets for baritone and bass, which continued to be issued from 1847 to 1850. The success of these remarkable productions, masterpieces in two arts, was overwhelming: they presented an epitome of all that was most unusual and most attractive in the curious university life of Sweden.
In the second volume of his collected works Wennerberg gave, long afterwards, a very interesting account of the inception and history of these celebrated duets. His great personal popularity, as the representative Swedish student, did not prevent him, however, from pursuing his studies, and he became an authority on Spinoza. In 1850 he first travelled through Sweden, singing and reciting in public, and his tour was a long popular triumph. In 1860 he published his collected trios, as &quot;De tre&quot; (&quot;The Three&quot;). In 1865, at the particular wish of the king, Charles XV, Wennerberg entered official life in the department of elementary education.

Wennerberg succeeded Christian Eric Fahlcrantz in 1866 as one of the eighteen of the Swedish Academy, and in 1870 became minister of education and ecclesiastical affairs in the cabinet of Axel Gustaf Adlercreutz, upon the fall of which in 1875 he retired for a time into private life. He was, however, made governor (&quot;landshövding&quot;) of Kronoberg County, and shortly afterward was elected to represent it in the Riksdag. His active parliamentary life continued until he was nearly eighty years of age. In 1881 and 1885 he issued his collected works, mainly in verse. He was yet again appointed minister of education and ecclesiastical affairs, for a second and final time in 1888, and served in office to 1891. After his resignation as a cabinet minister, he was then elected to the upper house of the Riksdag in 1893.

Wennerberg preserved his superb appearance in advanced old age, and he died, after a very short illness, on 24 August 1901, at Läckö Castle, where he was visiting his brother-in-law, Count Axel Rudenschöld. His wife, the Countess Hedvig Cronstedt, whom he married in 1852, died in 1900. Wennerberg was a most remarkable type of the lyrical, ardent Swedish aristocrat, full of the joy of life and the beauty of it. In the long roll of his eighty-four years there was scarcely a crumpled rose-leaf. His poems, to which their musical accompaniment is almost essential, have not ceased, in half a century, to be universally pleasing to Swedish ears; outside Sweden it would be difficult to make their peculiarly local charm intelligible.

==Relatives==
Wennerberg&#x27;s niece Sara Wennerberg-Reuter (1875–1959) was also a well-known musician; she was an organist and composer. His younger brother, Gunnar Brynolf Wennerberg was an artist.

<text>Steven Caldwell (born 12 September 1980) is a Scottish former footballer, coach, and executive. Playing as a defender, mostly as a centre back, Caldwell won 12 caps for the Scotland national team and has played over 300 league matches in his career, primarily in the top three tiers of English football. Since retiring from playing, he has been working as a Major League Soccer analyst for TSN in Canada.

Caldwell is the president of League1 Ontario club Oakville Blue Devils FC and has served as the assistant coach of the Canada national team.

His younger brother Gary was also a defender and Scotland international and was formerly the manager of Wigan Athletic.

==Club career==
===Newcastle United===
Born in Stirling, Scotland, Caldwell started out his football career at Hutchison Vale, along with his younger brother Gary. He then joined Premiership club Newcastle United at age fourteen, along with Gary, where they began their football careers. In 1998, Caldwell signed his first professional contract with the club. At some point in the 1999–00 season, he was promoted to the first team, appearing twice as an unused substitute.

In the 2000–01 season, Caldwell was called up to the first team, with Manager Bobby Robson said: &quot;Caldwell&#x27;s got a good pedigree. I like to put people in when it&#x27;s right and when it&#x27;s necessary and I can afford to do it, and not when we are forced to do it. But we are going to have the confidence with the lad to do it. He&#x27;s a steady character, has indomitable spirit and we like him very much.&quot; Caldwell made his Newcastle United debut on 30 September 2000 against Manchester City, coming on as a second half substitute for Andy Griffin, and played the rest of the game, keeping a clean sheet, in a 1–0 win. On 1 November 2000, he made his first start for the club against Bradford City in the League Cup and scored his first goal for Newcastle United, as they won 4–3. Since making his debut for the club, Caldwell rotated in and out of the first team, due to facing competitions in the defence. He then featured four more times for Newcastle United by the end of the year, making three starts. It wasn&#x27;t until on 3 March 2001 when Caldwell made his first appearances in two months, due to a thigh injury, starting the whole game, in a 1–1 draw against Everton. He later made two more appearances by the end of the 2000–01 season. At the end of the 2000–01 season, Caldwell went on to make nine appearances in all competitions.

At the start of the 2001–02 season, Caldwell was featured three times in Newcastle United&#x27;s matches in the UEFA Intertoto Cup and once set up a goal, in a 4–0 win against Lokeren on 14 July 2001. Due to lack of first team football opportunities, he was loaned out to Blackpool on a month&#x27;s loan. Caldwell made his debut for the club, starting the whole game, in a 2–1 win against Colchester United on 13 October 2001. In a follow–up match, he scored his first career goal, against Stoke City in the Football League Trophy, winning 3–2. Caldwell made a total of six appearances for Blackpool before returning to his parent club a month later.

Shortly after, Caldwell was loaned out to Bradford City on a month&#x27;s loan in December 2001. He made his debut for the club, starting the whole game, in a 3–1 win against Rotherham United on 8 December 2001. Since making his debut for Bradford City, Caldwell quickly became a first team regular for the side for the next two months there and had his loan spell extended at the club along the way. His loan spell at Bradford City ended in late–January, as he made nine appearances for the side.

At the start of the 2002–03 season, Caldwell continued to find his first team opportunities limited at Newcastle United, due to competitions in the central defence, with Manager Robson challenging him to fight for his first team place at the club. It wasn&#x27;t until on 2 November 2002 when he was called up to the first team and made his first appearance of the season, coming against Middlesbrough in the league and scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–0 win. Caldwell then made his UEFA Champions League debut against Inter Milan on 27 November 2002, coming on as an 86th-minute substitute, as Newcastle United lost 4–1. He then made six more starts for the club by the end of the year. Because of injuries to Andy O&#x27;Brien and Titus Bramble, Caldwell appeared three times at the beginning of January, including helping Newcastle United keep two consecutive clean sheets. However, he was dropped from the first team for the next two months, due to illness and competitions. In between the absence, Caldwell made his first UEFA Champions League start against Bayer Leverkusen, as the club won 3–1 on 26 February 2003. He later made four more appearances later in the 2002–03 season and contributed to the club&#x27;s UEFA Champions League qualification to next season. In total, Caldwell made seventeen appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Local newspaper Evening Chronicle said his involvement in the first team &quot;deserves credit for his unsung contribution&quot;

With his contract expiring at the end of the 2002–03 season, Caldwell said about his future, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve been in a worse position at this club. I&#x27;m not expecting anything at the moment. If the club wants me to stay, I&#x27;ll be delighted, but I&#x27;m 22 and I don&#x27;t want to spend my time in the reserves. I want to be playing for my country and I won&#x27;t be doing that if I&#x27;m in the reserves.&quot; Newcastle United offered a him a new contract, but he rejected it, with clubs like Rangers, Sunderland and Sporting CP were interested in signing him. With an imminent departure from Newcastle United, the club demanded a £750,000 compensation. But in an unexpected turn of an event, it was announced on 19 June 2003 that Caldwell signed a one–year contract extension with the club, having previously rejected the one before, describing it as an &quot;insult&quot;.

It wasn&#x27;t until on 15 October 2003 when Caldwell made his first appearance of the 2003–04 season, coming on as a 78th-minute substitute, in a 1–0 win against NAC Breda in the UEFA Cup, a win that saw Newcastle United through to the next round of the tournament following a 6–0 win on aggregate. He then made three more appearances for the club in the first half of the season. Manager Robson praised his performance in the last two matches. However, Caldwell continued to found his first team opportunities limited, due to competitions and his own injury concern. Because of this, Caldwell wanted to leave Newcastle United if he was not given first team football at the club. At one point, Caldwell was expected to leave Newcastle United on loan but Manager Robson blocked any attempts following an injury of Jonathan Woodgate. After Newcastle United recalled him due to an injury of Woodgate and Griffin, he made his appearances for the club since leaving, coming against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 9 May 2004. Caldwell appeared in the last two matches of the 2003–04 season, as Newcastle United failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League next season. In total at the club, he made a total of seven appearances in all competitions.

On 2 February 2004, Caldwell joined fellow Premiership club Leeds United on loan as part of a loan swap for Michael Bridges who went in the opposite direction. He made his debut for the club, starting the whole game, in a 2–0 loss against Aston Villa five days later on 7 February 2004. Since joining Leeds United, Caldwell became a first team regular, playing in the centre–back position, as he attempt to help the club avoid relegation once again. It wasn&#x27;t until on 10 April 2004 when Caldwell scored his first goal for Leeds United, in a 2–1 win against Blackburn Rovers. However, he was recalled by his parent club on 5 May 2004. By the time Caldwell was recalled, he made thirteen appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Following his absence, Leeds United was eventually relegated to the Championship.

Once the 2003–04 season was concluded, Caldwell was released by Newcastle United and by the time he left the club, he made thirty–seven appearances and scoring two times in all competitions.

===Sunderland===
Throughout the 2003–04 season, Sunderland wanted to sign Caldwell after their efforts to sign him, both on a free transfer and on loan failed. The club opted to wait to sign him on a free transfer at the end of the 2003–04 season. In May 2004, he agreed a move to Sunderland after leaving Newcastle United. The move was later confirmed on 27 June 2004, with the player signed a three–year contract.

After missing out the first match of the 2004–05 season, Caldwell made his debut for the club, starting the whole game, in a 3–1 win against Crewe Alexandra on 10 August 2004. This was followed up by scoring his first goal for Sunderland, in a 3–3 draw against Queens Park Rangers. Since making his debut for the club, Caldwell became was known for his whole-hearted approach to the game and the solid partnership he formed with Gary Breen. Caldwell said that his aim was to help Sunderland reach the promotion to the Premiership, in which Manager McCarthy praised Caldwell for his effort. However, during a 1–1 draw against Wigan Athletic on 28 August 2004, he suffered a knock and was substituted in the 25th minute as a result. After missing one match, Caldwell returned to the starting line–up against Gillingham on 10 September 2004 and kept a clean sheet, in a 4–0 win. It wasn&#x27;t until on 13 November 2004 when he scored his second goal for the club, in a 1–0 win against Leicester City. This was followed up by helping Sunderland keep two clean sheets in the next two matches, making it three in a row. However in a follow–up against West Ham United, Caldwell was sent–off in the 41st minute after clashing with Serhii Rebrov, as the club lost 2–0. After the match, Sunderland successfully appealed against his red card. However, his return was short–lived when he suffered a hamstring injury that saw him miss one match. Despite not risking Caldwell return ahead of the match against Leeds United on 26 December 2004, he returned to the starting line–up, as the club lost 3–2. However, his return was short–lived when Caldwell suffered a calf injury that saw him miss two matches. It wasn&#x27;t until on 4 February 2005 when he returned to the starting line–up against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Caldwell then scored his third goal of the season, as well as, setting up Sunderland&#x27;s first goal of the game, in a 5–1 win against Plymouth Argyle on 13 March 2005. Despite facing the sidelined during the 2004–05 season, he continued to regain his first team place, playing in the centre–back position for the rest of the season, as the club continued aiming to reach promotion to the Premiership. On 23 April 2005, Caldwell scored Sunderland&#x27;s winning goal against Leicester City to send his team back to the Premiership, which he successfully predicted. He later said it was the best moment as a footballer. In his first season at the club, Caldwell went on to make forty–one appearances and scoring four times in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2005–06 season, Caldwell said that he couldn&#x27;t wait to play in Premiership now that Sunderland has returned to the top–flight league. Caldwell made his first Premiership appearance in a year, starting the whole game, as the club lost 3–1 against Charlton Athletic in the opening game of the season. However, he missed the next six matches, due to competition in the defence. Caldwell returned to the starting line–up against Middlesbrough on 25 September 2005, as Sunderland won 2–0, giving their first Premier League since 2002. He regained his first team place in the defence for the next five matches, including setting up a goal against Arsenal on 5 November 2005. This lasted until Caldwell was dropped from the first team in the next two matches. It wasn&#x27;t until on 30 November 2005 when he returned to the starting line–up, in a 2–0 loss against Liverpool. Following his return, Caldwell regained his first team place and started in the next nine matches for Sunderland. Along the way, he received a straight red card in the 60th minute in a 2–1 loss against Fulham on 2 January 2006 after &quot;tripping Heiðar Helguson after the Icelandic international had embarrassingly broken the offside trap&quot;. The club&#x27;s appeal was unsuccessful and Caldwell had to serve a one-match suspension. Having picked up five yellow cards, he, once again, suspended for one match before not playing for the next three matches. It wasn&#x27;t until on 11 March 2006 when Caldwell returned to the starting line–up against Wigan Athletic and wore the club&#x27;s captaincy in the absence of Breen, as they lost 1–0. He then captained the side on two more occasions. Caldwell continued to rotate in and out of the starting line–up for the rest of the 2005–06 season, as Sunderland were relegated again in the 2005–06 season. At the end of the 2005–06 season, he went on to make twenty–six appearances in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2006–07 season, Caldwell was plagued with a knee injury that saw him sidelined for a month. He was tipped to become the next Sunderland captain following the departure of Breen and was eventually appointed. Caldwell captained in the opening game of the season against Coventry City., as the club lost 2–1. In a follow–up match against Birmingham City, he &quot; sprained the medial ligaments in his knee &quot; that saw him substituted in the 29th minute, as Sunderland lost 1–0. After the match, Caldwell was sidelined for almost three months. It wasn&#x27;t until on 4 November 2006 when he returned to the starting line–up against Norwich City, as the club lost 1–0.

Nevertheless, Caldwell was later featured eight times since returning before suffering a thigh injury that saw him substituted in the 16th-minute substitute, in a 1–0 loss against Preston North End on 30 December 2006. In the January transfer window, he was linked with a move away from the club: Sunderland accepted bids from Championship rivals Burnley and Coventry City. It came after when Manager Keane revealed that the contract talk between the club and Caldwell collapsed. Caldwell was then stripped of Sunderland&#x27;s captaincy due to his imminent departure from the club.

===Burnley===
It was agreed on 25 January 2007 that Burnley agreed to sign Caldwell from Sunderland. However, the move was in doubt and expected to see out his contract for the rest of the 2006–07 season. But the move was back and it was completed minutes before the transfer deadline in January 2007. He signed a three-and-a-half-year deal at Turf Moor for an initial £200,000, with a further £200,000 would be payable to Sunderland at a later date.

Caldwell made his Burnley debut, starting the whole game, in a 3–1 loss against Queens Park Rangers on 3 February 2007. After the match, Manager Steve Cotterill praised his debut performance. This was followed up by captaining the club for the first time against Sheffield Wednesday, as they drew 1–1. Since making his debut for Burnley, he quickly became a first team for the side, playing in the centre–back position. Caldwell was also named as the club&#x27;s captain and endeared himself to the team&#x27;s fans with his uncompromising tackling and commitment.

Prior to the match against Chelsea in the Round of 16 of the League Cup, Caldwell said he wanted the opposition team to field in stronger players, saying: &quot;I really hope they play their best team against us because you want to play against the very best. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll play a strong team, they seem to have been doing it in other rounds of the cup and you want to play against people like Nicolas Anelka, John Terry and Frank Lampard because they&#x27;re at the very top of football.&quot; However in a match, he captained Burnley throughout the match to extra time until his sending off in the 116th minute for a second bookable offence, as the club won 5–4 in the penalty shootout following a 1–1 draw.

Caldwell made his debut for the club on 18 May 2013, in the starting eleven at home to the Columbus Crew, and was &quot;bitterly disappointed&quot; by the 1–0 defeat.

===Senior career===
In April 2001, Caldwell was called up to the senior squad for the first time after breaking into the Newcastle United&#x27;s first team. He made his debut for Scotland in a 1–1 draw away in Poland at the Zdzisław Krzyszkowiak Stadium on 25 April 2001.

His home debut came on 12 February 2003 in a 2–0 defeat to the Republic of Ireland at Hampden Park. However, Caldwell did not play for the national side for rest of 2003, as Manager Berti Vogts placed him on the substitute bench and they did not qualify for the UEFA Euro 2004. It wasn&#x27;t until on 18 February 2004 when he returned to the starting line–up for Scotland, as they lost 4–0 against Wales.

However, Caldwell expressed his frustration on being overlooked from the national team squad, though he later credited new Manager Walter Smith for reviving his Scotland&#x27;s career.

Having been a year without being called up to the national team squad, Caldwell maintained that he&#x27;s still open to be called up for Scotland. It wasn&#x27;t until on 5 August 2009 when Caldwell was called up to the national team squad for the first time in three years. He played alongside Gary against Norway on 12 August 2009 until his younger brother was sent–off in the 13th minute before being substituted himself in the 48th minute, as Scotland lost 4–0 in the national side&#x27;s 2010 World Cup qualification.

It wasn&#x27;t until on 11 November 2010 when Caldwell was called up to the national team squad for over a year. He briefly captained Scotland when a substitution took place in a 3–0 win against the Faroe Islands on 16 November 2010. His twelfth and final full cap came against Northern Ireland in the 2011 Nations Cup. In total, Caldwell won twelve caps for Scotland at senior international level. Reflecting on his time at the national side, he said: &quot;I think I was unlucky at times with Scotland. I think there was a certain snobbery about playing in Scotland at the time. Guys who played with Scottish clubs got caps that I was better than. I sit here and I&#x27;m bloody proud of those 12 caps I won. I&#x27;m especially proud and will be forever proud of the three or four I played with my brother. I can&#x27;t ever really get across what that feels like, what that means for me, for him, for the two of us. It&#x27;s one of my greatest achievements in football. I got two late Scotland caps when I was playing for Wigan and I&#x27;m really, really proud of those. I felt like it was the start of this era that we&#x27;re in now. We had these young guys coming through – Steven Naismith, James Morrison, James McArthur. Kenny Miller was captain in that last game [against Northern Ireland in Dublin in 2011] and as he went off, he gave me the armband. It was another honour. Whatever the game, to have worn the Scottish armband, that was an incredible feeling.&quot;

Caldwell is separated and has two children, Will and Robbie, from a previous marriage. Having lived in England, Caldwell and his family immigrated to Canada after joining Toronto.

Throughout his professional career, Caldwell spoke about his relationship on his younger brother, Gary on playing together for Scotland, which happened. At one point, Steven (then at Burnley) and Gary (Wigan Athletic) almost faced each other prior to a match between Burnley and Wigan Athletic, but his injury prevented him doing so.

<text>A Life for the Tsar ( ) is a &quot;patriotic-heroic tragic&quot; opera in four acts with an epilogue by Mikhail Glinka. During the Soviet era the opera was known under the name &quot;Ivan Susanin&quot; ( ), due to the anti-monarchist censorship.

The original Russian libretto, based on historical events, was written by Nestor Kukolnik, Egor Fyodorovich (von) Rozen, Vladimir Sollogub and Vasily Zhukovsky. It premiered on 27 November 1836 OS (9 December NS) at the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in Saint Petersburg. The historical basis of the plot involves Ivan Susanin, a patriotic hero of the early 17th century who died in the expulsion of the invading Polish army for the newly elected Tsar Michael of Russia, the first of the Romanov dynasty, elected in 1613.

==History==
===Composition history===
The plot of &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; had been used earlier in 1815, when Catterino Cavos, an Italian-Russian composer, had written a two-act singspiel with the same subject and title. The original title of the opera was to be &quot;Ivan Susanin&quot;, after the hero, but when Nicholas I attended a rehearsal, Glinka changed the title to &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; as an ingratiating gesture. This title was retained in the Russian Empire.

In 1924, under the new Soviet administration, it appeared under the title &quot;Hammer and Sickle&quot;, but that production was not successful and was shelved. On 26 February 1939 it reappeared under the title Glinka had originally chosen, &quot;Ivan Susanin&quot;.

Glinka and the writers with whom he was associated chose, in Susanin, a hero of Russian nationalism well suited to the mood of the time. The opera was immediately hailed as a great success, and became the obligatory season-opener in the Imperial Russian opera theaters. &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; occupies an important position in Russian musical theater as the first native opera to win a permanent place in the repertoire. It was one of the first Russian operas to be known outside Russia.

===Performance history===
The opera was given its premiere performance on 27 November 1836 in Saint Petersburg conducted by Catterino Cavos with set designs by Andreas Roller. It was followed several years later with its premiere in Moscow on 7 September (Old Style) 1842 in a new production with sets by Serkov and Shenyan.

Glinka&#x27;s opera was featured heavily throughout the Romanov Tercentenary celebrations in 1913. It was performed in a gala performance at the Mariinsky Theatre, Schools, regiments, and amateur companies throughout imperial Russia staged performances of &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot;. Pamphlets and the penny press printed the story of Susanin &quot;ad nauseam&quot;, and one newspaper told how Susanin had showed each and every soldier how to fulfill his oath to the sovereign. The image of the seventeenth-century peasant features prominently at the bottom of the Romanov Monument in Kostroma, where a female personification of Russia gives blessings to a kneeling Susanin. In Kostroma, Tsar Nicholas II was even presented with a group of Potemkin peasants who claimed to be descendants of Susanin.

==Influences==
In keeping with Glinka&#x27;s European training, much of &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; was structured according to conventional Italian and French models of the period. Nevertheless, several passages in the opera are based on Russian folk songs or folk melodic idioms that become a full part of the musical texture.

Most importantly, this opera laid the foundation for the series of Russian nationalistic historical operas continued by works such as Serov&#x27;s &quot;Rogneda&quot;, Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Maid of Pskov&quot;, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Oprichnik&quot; or &quot;Mazeppa&quot;, and Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Prince Igor&quot;.

==Roles==
==Performance practice==
As popular as the opera was, its monarchist libretto was an embarrassment to the Soviet state. After some unsuccessful attempts were made to remedy this situation, in 1939 the poet S. M. Gorodetsky rewrote the text to remove references to the Tsar and otherwise make the libretto politically palatable.

==Synopsis==
*&quot;Time&quot;: The autumn of 1612 and the winter of 1613.

===Act 1===
&quot;The village of Domnino&quot;

Antonida is eager to marry Sobinin, but her father, Susanin, refuses permission until a Russian has been duly chosen to take the tsar&#x27;s throne. When Sobinin informs him that the Grand Council in Moscow has chosen a tsar, everyone celebrates.

===Act 2===
&quot;Poland&quot;

In a sumptuous hall, the nobility celebrates the Polish dominance over the Russians by singing and dancing. Suddenly, a messenger comes in with the news that Mikhail Romanov has been selected as the tsar of Russia but is now in hiding. The Poles vow to overthrow him.

===Act 3===
&quot;Susanin&#x27;s cabin&quot;

Susanin and his adopted son, Vanya, pledge to defend the new tsar. Susanin blesses Sobinin and Antonida on their upcoming wedding when a detachment of Polish soldiers bursts in to demand the tsar&#x27;s whereabouts. Instead, Susanin sends Vanya to warn the tsar while Susanin leads the soldiers off the trail into the woods. Antonida is devastated. Sobinin gathers some men to go on a rescue mission.

===Act 4===
&quot;A dense forest&quot;
Sobinin reassures his men of the rightness of their mission. When night falls, in a part of the forest near a monastery, Vanya knocks at the gates and alerts the inhabitants to spirit the tsar away. Susanin has led the suspicious Polish troops into an impassable, snow-covered area of the forest. The Poles sleep while Susanin waits for the dawn and bids farewell to his children. A blizzard sets in, and when day breaks, the Poles awake. They realise that Susanin has deceived them and so kill him.
===Epilogue===
&quot;Red Square, Moscow&quot;.

Across the stage walks a crowd of people, celebrating the triumph of the new tsar. Alone in their own solemn procession, Antonida, Sobinin and Vanya mourn Susanin. A detachment of Russian troops comes upon them, discovers their connection with Susanin and comforts them. As the scene changes to Red Square, the people proclaim glory to the tsar and to Susanin&#x27;s memory.

Orchestral excerpts heard in the concert hall consist largely of the overture and the Polish numbers of the second act. Another excerpt that is also used by concert bands and military bands is the &quot;Slavsya&quot; finale arranged for wind band as a fanfare. It is famous for being used in the 1945 Moscow Victory Parade and in other military parades since then. It is also a sung piece by choral groups. The finale piece was adapted for and has been also part of the repertoire of the world-famous Alexandrov Ensemble since 2004.

<text>Sorel Etrog, (August 29, 1933 February 26, 2014) was a Romanian-born Israeli-Canadian artist, writer, and primarily, a sculptor. He specialized in modern art works and contemporary sculpture. Etrog&#x27;s works explore his first-hand experience of the Second World War, the renewal of sculptural traditions in modern art, such as the use of bronze as a medium, and the opposition between the mechanical and the organic. One of Canada&#x27;s leading artists in the 1960s, Etrog contributed to the country&#x27;s growing interest in sculpture.

== Life ==
Born in Iaşi, Romania, in 1933, Etrog&#x27;s formal art training began in 1945. In 1950, his family immigrated to Israel, where beginning in 1953 he studied at the Institute of Painting and Sculpture in Tel Aviv. His first solo exhibition in Tel Aviv in 1958 earned him a scholarship at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York City (1958-1963). In 1959, a meeting with Toronto art collector Samuel Zacks led to Etrog&#x27;s first Canadian solo exhibition, at Gallery Moos in Toronto. Leaving New York for Toronto in 1963, Etrog became a Canadian citizen. After moving to Florence in 1965, he began casting his sculptures at the Michelucci Foundry, in Pistoia, and would continue to do so for the rest of his career. During this time, Etrog frequently visited his family in Israel. On one of his trips he met his future wife, Lika Behar, a fashion designer, who moved to Florence to live with him. However, a car accident that left Etrog badly injured led him and Behar to leave Florence in 1967 and move to Toronto, where they married.

== Career ==
Since the late 1950s, Etrog&#x27;s work has been exhibited extensively in solo and group exhibitions across Canada and internationally.

Etrog&#x27;s work is represented in major capitals and cities all over the world. He received several important commissions, including those for Expo 67, Montreal; SunLife Centre, Toronto; Windsor Sculpture Garden, Windsor, Ontario; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; and Olympic Park in Seoul, South Korea. His commission for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, entitled &quot;Powersoul&quot;, is his largest work. In 1966, works by Etrog, along with those of Alex Colville and Yves Gaucher, represented Canada at the Venice Biennale. In 1968 Etrog was commissioned to design the Canadian Film Award that was originally named the &quot;Etrog&quot; and later renamed the &quot;Genie&quot;.

Etrog is also known for his writings and published plays, poetry and non-fiction. Of his many collaborations, the most acclaimed are his book illustrations for Eugène Ionesco and Samuel Beckett in the late 1960s. Etrog and Marshall McLuhan collaborated on the publication &quot;Spiral&quot;, drawn from Etrog&#x27;s film of the same title which was broadcast on CBC television in 1975.

Numerous reviews, articles, monographs and catalogue texts have been written about Etrog, including Pierre Restany’s comprehensive textbook published by Prestel 2001. A major exhibition of Etrog&#x27;s paintings and drawings of the 1960s was exhibited in March 2008 at Buschlen Mowatt Gallery, Vancouver. The Art Gallery of Ontario presented a major retrospective of Etrog&#x27;s work in 2013, which coincided with his eightieth birthday.

From August 2021 to May 2022, Art Windsor Essex showcased Etrog&#x27;s history of graphic work (drawings, paintings, prints) in their exhibition, &quot;Links as Bones: Sorel Etrog and the Fragile Body&quot;&quot;.&quot;

== Death and legacy ==
Sorel Etrog died on February 26, 2014, aged 80. Since his death, Sorel Etrog&#x27;s legacy and collection are officially managed by The Estate of Sorel Etrog. The Jay &amp; Barbara Hennick Family Wellness Centre at the Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, includes close to 100 artworks by Sorel Etrog as part of its health and well-being intervention program.

<doc id="1253734" wikidata="Q778582" url="?curid=1253734" title="James MacCullagh">
<text>James MacCullagh (1809 – 24 October 1847) was an Irish mathematician.

==Early life==
MacCullagh was born in Landahaussy, near Plumbridge, County Tyrone, Ireland, but the family moved to Curly Hill, Strabane when James was about 10. He was the eldest of twelve children and demonstrated mathematical talent at an early age. He entered Trinity College Dublin as a student in 1824, winning a scholarship in 1827 and graduating in 1829.

==Career==
He became a fellow of Trinity College Dublin in 1832 and was a contemporary there of William Rowan Hamilton. He became a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1833. In 1835 he was appointed Erasmus Smith&#x27;s Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin and in 1843 became Erasmus Smith&#x27;s Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy. He was an inspiring teacher and taught notable scholars, including Samuel Haughton, Andrew Searle Hart, John Kells Ingram and George Salmon.

He had been involved in repeated priority disputes with Hamilton. In 1832, Hamilton published a prediction of conical refraction. In 1833, MacCullagh claimed that it is a special case of a theorem he published in 1830 that he did not explicate since it was not relevant to that particular paper. In 1842, Hamilton speculated on a model of ether, to which MacCullagh claimed that he had speculated on the same model.

Although he worked mostly on optics, he is also remembered for his work on geometry; his most significant work in optics was published in the mid-to-late 1830s; his most significant work on geometry &quot;On surfaces of the second order&quot; was published in 1843. He was awarded the Cunningham Medal of the Royal Irish Academy in 1838 for his paper on &quot;On the laws of crystalline reflexion and refraction&quot;. He won the Copley medal for his work on the nature of light in 1842.

MacCullagh was involved with the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He corresponded with many notable scientists, including John Herschel and Charles Babbage. In &quot;Passages from the Life of a Philosopher&quot;, Charles Babbage wrote that MacCullagh was &quot;an excellent friend of mine&quot; and discussed the benefits and drawbacks of the analytical engine with him.

==Work on Light and Optics==

MacCullagh&#x27;s most important paper on optics, &quot;An essay towards a dynamical theory of crystalline reflection and refraction&quot;, was presented to the Royal Irish Academy in December 1839. The paper begins by defining what was then a new concept, the curl of a vector field. (The term &#x27;curl&#x27; was first used by James Clerk Maxwell in 1870.) MacCullagh first showed that the curl is a covariant vector in the sense that its components are transformed in the appropriate manner under coordinate rotation. Taking his cue from George Green, he set out to develop a potential function for a dynamical theory for the transmission of light.

MacCullagh found that a conventional potential function proportional to the squared norm of the displacement field was incompatible with known properties of light waves. In order to support only transverse waves, he found that the potential function must be proportional to the squared norm of the curl of the displacement field. It was accepted that his radical choice ruled out any hope for a mechanical model for the ethereal medium. Nevertheless, the field equations stemming from this purely gyrostatic medium were shown to be in accord with all known laws, including those of Snell and Augustin-Jean Fresnel.

At several points, MacCullagh addresses the physical nature of an ethereal medium having such properties. Not surprisingly, he argues against a mechanical interpretation of the luminiferous aether because he readily admits that no known physical medium could have such a potential function resisting only the rotation of its elements. &quot;Concerning the peculiar constitution of the ether, we know nothing and shall suppose nothing, except what is involved in the foregoing assumptions [rectilinear vibrations in a medium of constant density]... Having arrived at the value of [the potential function], we may now take it for the starting point of our theory, and dismiss the assumptions by which we were conducted to it.&quot;

Despite the success of the theory, physicists and mathematicians were not receptive to the idea of reducing physics to a set of abstract field equations divorced from a mechanical model. The notion of the ether as a compressible fluid or similar physical entity was too deeply ingrained in nineteenth-century physical thinking, even for decades after the publication of Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic theory in 1864. MacCullagh&#x27;s ideas were largely abandoned and forgotten until 1880, when George Francis FitzGerald re-discovered and re-interpreted his findings in the light of Maxwell&#x27;s work.

William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin succeeded in developing a physically realizable model of MacCullagh&#x27;s rotationally elastic but translationally insensitive ether, consisting of gyrostats mounted on a framework of telescoping rods, described in his paper &quot;On a Gyrostatic Adynamic Constitution for Ether&quot; (1890).

==Death and legacy==
MacCullagh was an idealistic nationalist, in the sense of the time. He unsuccessfully contested the election for the Dublin University constituency in 1847. Suffering from overwork and a bout of depression, he died in 1847 by cutting his throat in his rooms at Trinity College Dublin.

After his death, Hamilton helped obtain pensions for his sisters.

In May 2009, an Ulster History Circle plaque was unveiled at his family tomb at St Patrick&#x27;s Church in Upper Badoney. The plaque was part of events organised by the Glenelly Historical Society to mark his life.

<text>The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier. It is lower-set, with shorter legs, and is more muscular with heavier bone density than the related American Rat Terrier. Much diversity exists in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed, and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha, and Tenterfield Terrier. The Rat Terrier&#x27;s background is said to stem from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working-class immigrants. Since the breed was a farm, hunting, and utility dog, little to no planned breeding was used other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other to produce the desired work ethic in the dog. The Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit Dog, and Wry-legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier&#x27;s ancestry. These early ratting terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle crossbred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs. Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell, and a very high intellect. Although they tend to be aloof with strangers, they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners at all times.

The current UKC standard calls for a Teddy Roosevelt Terrier to be at least 8 and no more than 12 inches in height, with weight proportionate to height. Teddy Roosevelt Terriers weighing as much as or as little as are not uncommon.

==Breed history==
Early American history shows that the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier, like the Rat Terrier, were often referred to as Feist or just plain terrier mixes - in the case of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier, &quot;bench-legged feist&quot;.

Since the breed was primarily a farm and hunting dog, crossing Rat Terriers to other breeds was common. One such early cross was with the Beagle, and this cross possibly reinforced the bench leg, since the Bench-legged Beagle was a common hunting companion.

Separating the long-legged phenotype from the short-legged phenotype in most cases did not occur, litters born from parents of either or both phenotypes commonly displayed a variety of leg and body length, yet all were still considered and labeled merely as Rat Terriers. In the middle 1990s, efforts to segregate the types began in earnest, but mixing of the two types in some cases still exists today.
When the types were separated by the Rat Terrier Club of America, the short-legged variety was named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt, although he never owned Rat Terriers nor was he instrumental in developing the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier. The dog most attributed to being one of the foundations for the Rat Terriers was a black-and-tan, mixed-breed, feist-type dog owned by the Roosevelts. In one of his letters to his children, President Roosevelt writes, &quot;There is a very cunning little dog named Skip, belonging to John Goff&#x27;s pack, who has completely adopted me. I think I shall take him home to Archie. He likes to ride on Dr. Lambert&#x27;s horse, or mine, and though he is not as big as Jack, takes eager part in the fight with every bear and bobcat.&quot; Often confused with Skip the black and tan feist, the Roosevelts also had a dog named Scamp. Scamp is the only dog mentioned in Roosevelt&#x27;s letters as ever hunting rats while in the White House, &quot;Scamp is really an extraordinary ratter and kills a great many rats in the White House, in the cellars and on the lower floor and among the machinery. He is really a very nice little dog.&quot; Unfortunately, no pictures of Scamp nor descriptions other than one which describes him as a Fox Terrier have been found. Another terrier which often is confused with the Rat Terrier was Roosevelt&#x27;s dog named Jack. In Mr. Roosevelt&#x27;s letter dated July 27, 1902, to Mrs. Roswell Field, he writes, &quot;It is a real pleasure to send you a photograph of my boy Kermit, with Jack, the Manchester Terrier, who is absolutely a member of the family.&quot; Jack was a Manchester Terrier, not a Rat Terrier.

The first standard for the breed was developed by the now-defunct Teddy Roosevelt Terrier Club of America in 1996. Currently, several registration organizations are active, all of which have their own standards, but the most commonly accepted are the United Kennel Club and the United Kennel Club International, although the UKCI still only recognizes them as a variation of the Rat Terrier.

In 1999, both &quot;Rat Terrier&quot; and “Teddy Roosevelt Terrier&quot; were accepted as a separate breeds by the United Kennel Club.

Currently, the UKC accepts single Teddy Roosevelt Terrier registration applications for dogs from 10 different registries, where they are simply designated as Rat Terriers. .

In August 2016 the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier was accepted into the AKC Foundation Stock Services. In July 2019, the breed advanced to the AKC Miscellaneous Class.

==Appearance==

The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a low-set, muscular, active, small- to medium-sized hunting terrier. The preferred ratio of length of body (prosternum to point of buttocks) to height (withers to ground) is 10:7. The head is broad, slightly domed, wedge-shaped, and proportionate to the size of the body. Ears are V-shaped, set at the outside edges of the skull, and may be erect or button. A docked tail is preferred, but a natural bob tail or a natural tail carried in an upward curve is also acceptable. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier occurs in solid white, other solid colors with markings, and white with a variety of colored patches.

The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier should be evaluated as a working terrier, and exaggerations, or faults, should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog&#x27;s ability to work. Honorable scars resulting from field work are not to be penalized.

Disqualifications: Unilateral or bilateral cryptorchid; viciousness or extreme shyness; unilateral or bilateral deafness; hanging ears; cropped ears; hairlessness; any suggestion of kink or curl in tail; merle.

==Common characteristics==
Like the Rat Terrier, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier of today is bred for versatility, including hunting instincts, soundness of health, great temperament, and good looks. Teddy Roosevelt Terriers have higher than average prey drive and will chase squirrels, rats, stray cats, and any other animals they consider prey. They also dig and follow mole trails, leaving an array of trenches and holes behind. They make excellent watch dogs, and can be very protective and territorial. They share a love for their families and become very attached, craving human interaction and affection. Always by their owners&#x27; sides, they become constant shadows, following their masters around throughout the daily routine.

These dogs are very smart and loyal, which makes them easy to train. They are energetic and playful, and their antics can make one laugh daily. However, when it is time to settle down, they are just as content to be in a lap.

They can adapt to almost any lifestyle, whether shown in conformation rings, working in agility trials, or just a great companion for home or farm. Their size makes them suitable for apartment living, as well. Today, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is gaining a solid following and becoming a popular household companion.(Source AKC) 

==Health problems==
Less common problems may include allergies, bite problems (malocclusions), hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, and subluxating patella, as these are problems that appear in the related Rat Terrier.

Ectopia lentis, a congenital condition, also affects this breed. Although not currently well-documented in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier, it is seen in small numbers and populations according to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, but is still seen in higher numbers in the Rat Terrier and other terrier breeds.

<text>Louis I ( – 26 August 1346, ruled 1322–1346) was Count of Flanders, Nevers and Rethel.

==Life==
He was the son of Louis I, Count of Nevers, and Joan, Countess of Rethel, and grandson of Robert III of Flanders. He succeeded his father as count of Nevers and his grandfather as count of Flanders in 1322. 

In July 1320 Louis married Margaret, second daughter of King Philip V of France and Joan II, Countess of Burgundy, who would later inherit her mother&#x27;s counties of Burgundy and Artois in 1361. This marriage alliance made him break with the anti-French policy of his grandfather Robert III and great-grandfather Guy I.

==Count of Flanders==
Louis&#x27;s pro-French policies and excessive taxations caused an uprising in 1323. Beginning as a series of scattered rural riots, the peasant insurrection escalated into a full-scale rebellion that dominated public affairs in Flanders for nearly five years until 1328. The rebels, led by Nicolaas Zannekin, captured the towns of Nieuwpoort, Veurne, Ypres and Kortrijk. In Kortrijk, Zannekin was able to capture Louis himself. On 30 November 1325 in the church of St. Basil, Louis swore amnesty to the rebels, investigation of John of Namur&#x27;s actions as regent, and approval of all actions take by regent Robert of Cassel. The following day, Louis was released and fled to Paris. 

On 26 April 1326, the King Charles IV of France, intervened and the &quot;Peace of Arques&quot; was sealed. This treaty presented the King of France as the aggrieved party, leaving Louis as a bystander. The treaty, not supported by rebel districts in Flanders, did not last long, and soon hostilities erupted again. Philip VI of France was forced to come to Louis&#x27;s aid while Zannekin and his adherents were decisively defeated by the French royal army in the Battle of Cassel. Control of Flanders was returned to Louis, with a warning from Philip that if Louis needed to be rescued again, Flanders would be incorporated into the kingdom of France.

When the Hundred Years War started, Louis remained steadfast in his French policy, even with the county being economically dependent on England. His actions resulted in a boycott of the wool trade imposed by King Edward III of England, which in turn sparked a new insurrection in 1337 under Jacob van Artevelde. In 1339 the count had to flee his lands, never being able to return. Louis was killed at the Battle of Crécy in 1346.

==Family==
Louis and Margaret had:
*Louis II of Flanders (1330–1384), who succeeded him.
He also had a natural son Guy de Rickenbourg.

<doc id="1253752" wikidata="Q1343174" url="?curid=1253752" title="Albert Mathiez">
<text>Albert-Xavier-Émile Mathiez (; 10 January 1874 – 26 February 1932) was a French historian, best known for his Marxist interpretation of the French Revolution. Mathiez emphasized class conflict. He argued that 1789 pitted the bourgeoisie against the aristocracy and then the Revolution pitted the bourgeoisie against the sans-culottes, who were a proletariat-in-the-making. Mathiez greatly influenced Georges Lefebvre and Albert Soboul in forming what came to be known as the orthodox Marxist interpretation of the Revolution. Mathiez admired Maximilien Robespierre, praised the Reign of Terror and did not extend complete sympathy to the struggle of the proletariat.

== Career ==
Mathiez came from a peasant family in Eastern France, being born in La Bruyère, Haute-Saône. He showed high intelligence as a young student, with a strong interest in history. He entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1894, by which time he had already displayed a strong anti-clerical bias. After graduation, he passed the aggregation in history and after doing his military service entered the teaching profession. He taught at a variety of local lycèes until he completed his doctorate which he wrote under the direction of François Victor Alphonse Aulard, then the leading historian of the Revolution, who admired Georges Danton. Mathiez was greatly influenced by Jean Jaurès, who propounded a more radical economic and social interpretation. At first a good friend of Aulard, he broke with his mentor in 1907, founding his own society, the Société des études robespierristes, with its journal, the &quot;Annales révolutionnaires&quot;. He also moved up from the lycée to the university level, teaching at Besançon and Dijon.

Earlier a pacifist, Mathiez developed into a nationalistic Jacobin after the World War I erupted in 1914. He used his scholarship on the Revolution to demonstrate that just as Revolutionary France had defeated the allied coalition in the 1790s, so too the Third Republic would triumph over Imperial Germany. With its serious economic and social stresses such as shortages of food and rationing, the war prompted him to study similar conditions during the Revolution. The eventual result was one of his most original works, &quot;La Vie chère et le movement social sous la Terreur&quot; (1927).

In his masterwork &quot;La Révolution française&quot; (3 vol. 1922–1924), Mathiez boldly made Maximilien Robespierre the hero. Émile Durkheim&#x27;s work in the sociology of religion influenced his interpretation of the 1790s.

Mathiez saw the French Revolution as the critical first stage in a proletarian advance that would gather strength in the revolutions of 1848, the Paris Commune of 1871 and the Russian revolts of 1905 and reached its highest point during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia which created a dictatorship in the name of the proletariat.

Mathiez rejected the common view of Robespierre as demagogic, dictatorial and fanatical. Mathiez argued he was an eloquent spokesman for the poor and oppressed, an enemy of royalist intrigues, a vigilant adversary of dishonest and corrupt politicians, a guardian of the French Republic, an intrepid leader of the French Revolutionary government and a prophet of a socially responsible state. 
Mathiez held the highly prestigious Sorbonne chair in French Revolutionary Studies and was the founder of the Societe des Etudes Robespierristes which led to the creation in 1908 of the highly regarded journal &quot;Annales révolutionnaries&quot; that became &quot;Annales historiques de la Révolution française&quot; in 1924.

Mathiez was active in the French Communist Party from 1920 but resigned in 1922. He joined the Socialist Communist Union but left it shortly after, becoming closer to the SFIO and supporting the Cartel des Gauches. By 1930, he was attacked by Stalinist historians, who condemned Mathiez and his Jacobinism as adversaries of the proletarian revolution. He was a vigorous polemicist. In his own defense after 1930, he mounted a sharp critique of his detractors.

On February 26, 1932, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in the presence of his students, in the Michelet amphitheater of the Sorbonne; quickly hospitalized, he died in the evening without having regained consciousness.

A commemorative plaque in his likeness is still to this day in the amphitheater of the Sorbonne.

<text>Paweł Bartłomiej Piskorski (born 25 February 1968 in Warsaw) is a former Polish politician.

He was Mayor of Warsaw from 30 March 1999 to 14 January 2002. In 1997 he was elected to the Sejm from the Freedom Union electoral list, and in 2001, after participating in a secession from that party, he successfully ran under the Civic Platform banner. In 2004 he was the Secretary General of Civic Platform. He has been elected Member of the European Parliament in 2004. On 26 April 2006 he was excluded from the Civic Platform. Since February 2009 he has been the chairman of the Democratic Party.

==Alleged corruption==

In April 2006 Polish newspaper &quot;Dziennik&quot; informed about the purchase in 2005 by Paweł Piskorski and his wife of more than 320 hectares of land for afforestation. The total cost of the purchase amounted to 1.25 million zł. According to the newspaper’s journalist, this amount exceeded the value of assets declared by the MEP in a financial statement for that year. Paweł Piskorski explained that the money came from sale of property, credit, savings and current income by him and his wife. That declaration was not officially challenged by any public authority. Nevertheless, Piskorski&#x27;s reputation has been irrecoverably damaged. The day after the publication the national board of the Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) decided to exclude him from the party, which was followed on 17 May by the removal of his ten collaborators, among others, Piotr Fogler. The official reason stated was damage to Civic Platform’s image.

In January 2009 Paweł Piskorski joined the Democratic Party (Stronnictwo Demokratyczne), thus becoming the only MEP of the party, as well as declaring his intention to run for the position of chairman. This position was obtained at an extraordinary Democratic Party congress, held on 21 February that year. However, his nomination was followed by the publication of his statements given to the National Revenue Service agency to explain sources of his income. He tried to explain that he earned money by persistent winnings at the casino and by art trading. Public opinion took these clarifications with disbelief, which torpedoed the election campaign of the Democratic Party.

In January 2010, a public prosecutor charged him with the use of a forged document (contract with an antique dealer) in tax proceedings. Paweł Piskorski pleaded not guilty to committing this act.

Piskorski is listed in the Panama Papers as a beneficiary or shareholder in an offshore company.

<text>Carl Philip Robinson (born 13 October 1976) is a Welsh former international footballer who played as a central midfielder. He is currently the assistant coach at Atlanta United FC.

==Early life==
Robinson was born and raised in Llandrindod Wells, where he attended Oxford Road Primary School and Llandrindod High School.

==Club career==
===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Robinson started his career as a trainee with Wolverhampton Wanderers. He was promoted to the first-team for the 1995–96 season.

====Loan to Shrewsbury Town====
On 28 March 1996, Robinson was sent on loan to Shrewsbury Town for the remainder of the season to gain first-team experience. Two days later, Robinson made his professional debut against Hull City in a 1–1 draw at Gay Meadow in front of 2,346 supporters. He made five appearances for The Shrews: four in the league and one in The Football League Trophy final at Wembley Stadium in a 2–1 defeat against Rotherham United on 14 April 1996.

====Return to Wolves====
Following his loan spell at Shrewsbury Town, Robinson returned to Wolves for the 1996–97 season, making his club debut that year. He would go on to become a regular with the first-team over the next six seasons as the club challenged regularly for promotion to the Premier League and made a memorable run to the semifinals of the 1997–98 FA Cup, losing to eventual champions Arsenal. Robinson was released by Wolves in June 2002 at the expiry of his contract.

===Portsmouth===
After over 180 appearances for Wolves over six seasons, he moved to Portsmouth in July 2002 under the Bosman ruling. He played 15 league games for Portsmouth in the first half of their Championship season before finishing the season with loan spells at Sheffield Wednesday (where he scored once against future club Norwich) and Walsall, where he scored once against Bradford City. The following season he was loaned out again, this time to Rotherham, Sheffield United and Sunderland. However between these loan spells he did return to Portsmouth to make one Premier League appearance against Chelsea.

===Sunderland===
After impressing at Sunderland he signed a three-year deal in June 2004. He then went on to collect another championship winners medal as they gained promotion during a season in which he played 42 of 46 matches to become a fan&#x27;s favourite.

===Norwich City===
After a loan spell with Norwich City, he signed for The Canaries permanently on a 2.5 year deal for an undisclosed fee in January 2006. Robinson scored his first goal for Norwich in a 5–1 win against Barnsley on 26 August 2006.

===Toronto FC===
On 31 January 2007, Robinson joined Toronto FC from Norwich after just over a year at Carrow Road, even though he still had 18 months remaining on his deal with Norwich. He scored his first MLS goal when he netted Toronto&#x27;s third in a 4–0 win against FC Dallas on 17 June 2007. He was voted team MVP in his first year and repeated in his second year at the club.

===New York Red Bulls===
In March 2010 he was traded from Toronto FC to the New York Red Bulls to join Hans Backe for a fourth-round pick in the 2011 MLS SuperDraft. On 20 March 2010, Robinson started for New York in a 3–1 victory against Santos FC, which was the first match played at the new Red Bull Arena. On 21 August 2010, he scored his first goal for New York Red Bulls in a 4–1 road victory against his old club Toronto FC and refused to celebrate due to his relationship with the supporters. During his time at New York Red Bulls he became a player coach.

==International career==
A Wales international player, Robinson made his debut against Belarus in 1999, winning the man of the match award. His 50th cap came in the 2–0 World Cup Qualifier victory over Liechtenstein. On 1 April 2009, Robinson announced his retirement from international football at the age of 32 with 52 caps after Wales suffered two consecutive defeats, making it virtually impossible for them to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

==Coaching career==

===Vancouver Whitecaps FC===
In January 2012, Robinson retired as a player and joined the Vancouver Whitecaps FC as an assistant coach. He took over as the head coach of the club in December 2013. The club parted ways with Robinson on 25 September with 5 games remaining in the 2018 season after just under 5 years. He amassed just under 200 games as Caps boss in his stay.

===Newcastle Jets===
In February 2020, Robinson signed a three-and-a-half-year contract as the head coach of Australian A-League club Newcastle Jets. On 14 October 2020, the Jets announced that Robinson was in talks with Western Sydney Wanderers.

===Western Sydney Wanderers===
On 15 October 2020, Western Sydney Wanderers announced the signing of Robinson from Newcastle Jets. On 30 January 2022 Wanderers relieved Robinson of his duties and thanked him for his time at the club.

===Birmingham City===
Having worked with Wayne Rooney at Major League Soccer club D.C. United, Robinson followed him to EFL Championship club Birmingham City in October 2023 as a first-team coach. After fifteen matches, which included nine defeats and only two wins, Rooney and Robinson were dismissed on 2 January 2024.

<doc id="1253776" wikidata="Q6096092" url="?curid=1253776" title="Ivan Corea">
<text>Hector Vernon Ivan Seneviratne Corea (Sinhala: හෙක්ටර් වර්නන් අයිවන් සෙනෙවිරත්න කොරයා) was a priest of the Church of Ceylon.

==Early life==

Ivan Corea was born in Chilaw, Ceylon, to James Alfred Ernest Corea and Letitia Grace Alice Seneviratne. His uncles were the freedom fighters Charles Edgar Corea and Victor Corea, who founded the Chilaw Association and the Ceylon National Congress. Ivan Corea was a direct descendant of King Dominicus Corea, (also known as Edirille Rala). He was crowned King of Kotte and Sitawaka by Vimala Dharma Suriya, King of Kandy, in 1596. Mahatma Gandhi met James Corea when he was hosted by the Corea family in Chilaw, on his first and only visit to Ceylon in 1927.

The young Corea was educated at Royal College Colombo. He joined the clergy of the Anglican Church of Ceylon in 1926. An early posting was at St. Phillip&#x27;s Church in Kurana, Katunayake, followed by St Luke’s in Borella. Having spent several years in the priesthood, Corea was appointed Chaplain to the Bishop of Colombo. He was also made a Canon of the Cathedral Church of Christ in his sacerdotal silver jubilee. In the 1960s, Corea was appointed Rural Dean of Colombo.

==St. Luke&#x27;s Church Borella==

Corea was Vicar of St. Luke&#x27;s Church Borella for 25 years (1929 - 1954). Corea and his wife Ouida Corea played a key role in re-building St. Luke&#x27;s. The edifice was designed by Corea, including the designs on each pillar, the octagonal tower of the sanctuary, the doors and windows, and all decorative motifs within the church. The foundation stone for the extension was laid on 17 October 1938 by the Commissary of the Bishop of Colombo, F. L. Beven.

==The Easter Sunday Raid==

St. Luke&#x27;s Church was packed on Easter Sunday morning (5 April) 1942 when Admiral Chuichi Nagumo and the Japanese Imperial Navy attacked the city of Colombo, Ceylon, during World War II. Among the congregation attending the Easter Sunday service were British and Ceylonese military personnel. 

The attack commenced around 7.30 a.m.; Corea was preaching at the time, when according to the parishioners of St. Luke&#x27;s, the RAF Hawker Hurricanes swooped over the church to engage the Japanese Zero fighters in dogfights above the skies of Borella. The zero fighters and bombers were led by Captain Mitsuo Fuchida, who also led the attack on Pearl Harbor.


==St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Milagiriya==

Following the death of his wife, Ouida, Corea left St. Luke&#x27;s Church in 1954 and was appointed Vicar of St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Milagiriya, one of the oldest churches in Ceylon. The church was first built by the Portuguese in the 15th Century as a Roman Catholic church. The British built a new church in 1848 and called it St. Paul&#x27;s. He built the Lucien Jansz Memorial at St. Paul&#x27;s Church Milagiriya as well as re-building St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Pamankada.

==Diocese of Colombo==
In 1941 the bishop of Colombo appointed a Historical Select Committee to compile a history of the diocese, to celebrate the centennial of the foundation of the diocese. The bishop co-opted Corea to the committee and served as secretary.[7] Corea is also mentioned in the document as &quot;one of four men who not only distinguished themselves in Theology, but also had the privilege of assisting their teacher in later years as Lecturers in the Divinity School. H.V.Ivan S.Corea has been honored by the bishop by being called to the office and dignity of an Examining Chaplain to the Lord Bishop of Colombo.&quot;. Corea also served on the Diocesan Council of the Centenary Year in 1945. He also contributed to the &quot;Church Times&quot; newspaper in the United Kingdom.

Corea died in Madampe in 1968. Among those who paid their respects at his funeral in Maha Nuge Gardens, Colombo, were the Governor-General of Ceylon William Gopallawa, the Prime Minister of Ceylon Dudley Senanayake and the Finance Minister Junius Richard Jayewardene. The funeral service was led by Harold De Soyza, the first-ever Sri Lankan Anglican bishop of Colombo. The Ceylon Daily News noted at the time, &quot;The Rt. Reverend Harold De Soysa, Bishop of Colombo paid tribute to the late Canon Corea referring to his ministry of loving service and made particular reference to his work on the history of the Diocese of Colombo.&quot;. At the time of his death, Corea was editing a revised version of &quot;A History of the Church of Ceylon&quot;.

==&quot;Piyaneni&quot;==
Corea was immortalized in a song in the 1970s when the Sri Lankan singer Clarence Wijewardena composed &#x27;Piyaneni&#x27; (Father) in memory of Corea. &quot;Piyaneni&quot; was sung by Wijewardena&#x27;s music partner Annesley Malewana and recorded at Auggie Ranaweera&#x27;s studio in Bambalapitiya, in Colombo. 

==Family==
Corea’s eldest son is Vernon Corea, a Sri Lankan broadcaster. His younger son was Ernest Corea, who was Sri Lanka&#x27;s Ambassador to the United States, Cuba and Mexico.

<text>A 2-8-8-2, in the Whyte notation for describing steam locomotive wheel arrangements, is an articulated locomotive with a two-wheel leading truck, two sets of eight driving wheels, and a two-wheel trailing truck. The equivalent UIC classification is, refined to Mallet locomotives, (1′D)D1′ 4v. These locomotives usually employ the Mallet principles of articulation—with the rear engine rigidly attached to the boiler and the front engine free to rotate—and compounding. The 2-8-8-2 was a design largely limited to American locomotive builders. The last 2-8-8-2 was retired in 1962 from the N&amp;W&#x27;s roster, two years past the ending of steam though steam was still used on steel mill lines and other railroads until 1983.

Other equivalent classifications are: 
: UIC classification: (1′D)D1′
: French classification: 140+041 
: Turkish classification: 45+45 
: Swiss classification: 4/5+4/5

A similar wheel arrangemement exists for Garratt locomotives, but is referred to as 2-8-0+0-8-2 since both engine units swivel.

The first 2-8-8-2 was built in 1909 by Baldwin, who sold two to the Southern Pacific Railroad (classified MC-1), and then three each to the Union Pacific Railroad and UP-owned Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company. Baldwin conceived the type as an expansion of the 2-6-6-2 permitting a greater tractive effort.

The next order for the type was from the Southern Pacific; these differed in being cab forward locomotives, so that the crew could have better visibility and breathing in the SP&#x27;s long tunnels and snow sheds. They were very successful, and SP continued to order cab-forward locomotives, building an eventual fleet of 256 of numerous classes; later cab-forwards were 4-6-6-2s (originally 2-6-6-2s) and 4-8-8-2s.

The 2-8-8-2 proved itself to be a capable hauler on mountain grades, enabling the replacement of several smaller locomotives and hauling longer trains than before. Most of them were not fast; they hauled at drag freight speeds, up to . However, the Norfolk and Western Y6 class were designed to run up to . The locomotives were adopted by a broad spectrum of mountain railroads, including the Norfolk &amp; Western, Southern, Virginian, Great Northern, Clinchfield, Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western, Reading, Western Maryland, Missouri Pacific, Frisco, and the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway. On many railroads, the locomotives of the type were the most powerful on the roster. When built, the 2-8-8-2s of the Western Pacific Railroad were among the most powerful steam locomotives in the world and formed the basis for the later 2-8-8-4 &quot;Yellowstone&quot; type engines used by the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range.

The last compound Mallet locomotives to operate on major railroads in the United States were the 2-8-8-2 Y6b class of the Norfolk and Western Railway. After their final modifications in the 1950s, they were said to be capable of 170,000 lbs tractive effort in simple-expansion mode, although some have questioned this claim (the original design tractive effort was 152,206 lbs SIMPLE and 126,838 lbs COMPOUND). The last were retired in May 1960.

As of 2008, there are two surviving 2-8-8-2 locomotives, both former Norfolk &amp; Western. N&amp;W 2050 is from the railroad&#x27;s Y3a class; Alco&#x27;s Richmond works built it in 1923 and it is displayed at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois. N&amp;W 2156, the most powerful extant steam locomotive in the world (in terms of tractive effort), is from the railroad&#x27;s Y6a class; N&amp;W&#x27;s own Roanoke Shops built it in 1942 and it is owned by the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri. The 2156 was displayed at the Virginia Museum of Transportation in Roanoke, Virginia from 2015 to 2020, after which it returned to the Museum of Transportation in St. Louis.

<text>Relativistic quantum chemistry combines relativistic mechanics with quantum chemistry to calculate elemental properties and structure, especially for the heavier elements of the periodic table. A prominent example is an explanation for the color of gold: due to relativistic effects, it is not silvery like most other metals.

The term relativistic effects was developed in light of the history of quantum mechanics. Initially, quantum mechanics was developed without considering the theory of relativity. Relativistic effects are those discrepancies between values calculated by models that consider relativity and those that do not. Relativistic effects are important for heavier elements with high atomic numbers, such as lanthanides and actinides.

Relativistic effects in chemistry can be considered to be perturbations, or small corrections, to the non-relativistic theory of chemistry, which is developed from the solutions of the Schrödinger equation. These corrections affect the electrons differently depending on the electron speed compared with the speed of light. Relativistic effects are more prominent in heavy elements because only in these elements do electrons attain sufficient speeds for the elements to have properties that differ from what non-relativistic chemistry predicts.

==History==
Beginning in 1935, Bertha Swirles described a relativistic treatment of a many-electron system, despite Paul Dirac&#x27;s 1929 assertion that the only imperfections remaining in quantum mechanics &quot;give rise to difficulties only when high-speed particles are involved and are therefore of no importance in the consideration of the atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions in which it is, indeed, usually sufficiently accurate if one neglects relativity variation of mass and velocity and assumes only Coulomb forces between the various electrons and atomic nuclei&quot;.

Theoretical chemists by and large agreed with Dirac&#x27;s sentiment until the 1970s, when relativistic effects were observed in heavy elements. The Schrödinger equation had been developed without considering relativity in Schrödinger&#x27;s 1926 article. Relativistic corrections were made to the Schrödinger equation (see Klein–Gordon equation) to describe the fine structure of atomic spectra, but this development and others did not immediately trickle into the chemical community. Since atomic spectral lines were largely in the realm of physics and not in that of chemistry, most chemists were unfamiliar with relativistic quantum mechanics, and their attention was on lighter elements typical for the organic chemistry focus of the time.

Dirac&#x27;s opinion on the role relativistic quantum mechanics would play for chemical systems has been largely dismissed for two main reasons. First, electrons in &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; atomic orbitals travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Second, relativistic effects give rise to indirect consequences that are especially evident for &quot;d&quot; and &quot;f&quot; atomic orbitals.

==Qualitative treatment==

One of the most important and familiar results of relativity is that the relativistic mass of the electron increases as

formula_1

where formula_2 are the electron rest mass, velocity of the electron, and speed of light respectively. The figure at the right illustrates this relativistic effect as a function of velocity.

This has an immediate implication on the Bohr radius (formula_3), which is given by

formula_4

where formula_5 is the reduced Planck constant, and α is the fine-structure constant (a relativistic correction for the Bohr model).

Bohr calculated that a 1s orbital electron of a hydrogen atom orbiting at the Bohr radius of 0.0529 nm travels at nearly 1/137 the speed of light. One can extend this to a larger element with an atomic number &quot;Z&quot; by using the expression formula_6 for a 1s electron, where &quot;v&quot; is its radial velocity, i.e., its instantaneous speed tangent to the radius of the atom. For gold with &quot;Z&quot; = 79, &quot;v&quot; ≈ 0.58&quot;c&quot;, so the 1s electron will be moving at 58% of the speed of light. Substituting this in for &quot;v&quot;/&quot;c&quot; in the equation for the relativistic mass, one finds that &quot;m&quot;rel = 1.22&quot;m&quot;e, and in turn putting this in for the Bohr radius above one finds that the radius shrinks by 22%.

If one substitutes the &quot;relativistic mass&quot; into the equation for the Bohr radius it can be written
formula_7
It follows that
formula_8

At right, the above ratio of the relativistic and nonrelativistic Bohr radii has been plotted as a function of the electron velocity. Notice how the relativistic model shows the radius decreases with increasing velocity.

When the Bohr treatment is extended to hydrogenic atoms, the Bohr radius becomes
formula_9
where formula_10 is the principal quantum number, and &quot;Z&quot; is an integer for the atomic number. In the Bohr model, the angular momentum is given as formula_11. Substituting into the equation above and solving for formula_12 gives
formula_13

From this point, atomic units can be used to simplify the expression into;formula_14

Substituting this into the expression for the Bohr ratio mentioned above gives
formula_15

At this point one can see that a low value of formula_10 and a high value of formula_17 results in formula_18. This fits with intuition: electrons with lower principal quantum numbers will have a higher probability density of being nearer to the nucleus. A nucleus with a large charge will cause an electron to have a high velocity. A higher electron velocity means an increased electron relativistic mass, and as a result the electrons will be near the nucleus more of the time and thereby contract the radius for small principal quantum numbers.

== Periodic table deviations ==

=== Mercury ===

Mercury (Hg) is a liquid down to approximately −39 °C, its melting point. Bonding forces are weaker for Hg–Hg bonds than for their immediate neighbors such as cadmium (m.p. 321 °C) and gold (m.p. 1064 °C). The lanthanide contraction only partially accounts for this anomaly. Because the 6s2 orbital is contracted by relativistic effects and may therefore only weakly contribute to any chemical bonding, Hg–Hg bonding must be mostly the result of van der Waals forces.

Mercury gas is mostly monatomic, Hg(g). Hg2(g) rarely forms and has a low dissociation energy, as expected due to the lack of strong bonds. 

Au2(g) and Hg(g) are analogous with H2(g) and He(g) with regard to having the same nature of difference. The relativistic contraction of the 6s2 orbital leads to gaseous mercury sometimes being referred to as a pseudo noble gas.

=== Color of gold and caesium ===


The reflectivity of aluminium (Al), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) is shown in the graph to the right. The human eye sees electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength near 600 nm as yellow. Gold absorbs blue light more than it absorbs other visible wavelengths of light; the reflected light reaching the eye is therefore lacking in blue compared with the incident light. Since yellow is complementary to blue, this makes a piece of gold under white light appear yellow to human eyes.

The electronic transition from the 5d orbital to the 6s orbital is responsible for this absorption. An analogous transition occurs in silver, but the relativistic effects are smaller than in gold. While silver&#x27;s 4d orbital experiences some relativistic expansion and the 5s orbital contraction, the 4d–5s distance in silver is much greater than the 5d–6s distance in gold. The relativistic effects increase the 5d orbital&#x27;s distance from the atom&#x27;s nucleus and decrease the 6s orbital&#x27;s distance. Due to the decreased 6s orbital distance, the electronic transition primarily absorbs in the violet/blue region of the visible spectrum, as opposed to the UV region.

Caesium, the heaviest of the alkali metals that can be collected in quantities sufficient for viewing, has a golden hue, whereas the other alkali metals are silver-white. However, relativistic effects are not very significant at &quot;Z&quot; = 55 for caesium (not far from &quot;Z&quot; = 47 for silver). The golden color of caesium comes from the decreasing frequency of light required to excite electrons of the alkali metals as the group is descended. For lithium through rubidium, this frequency is in the ultraviolet, but for caesium it reaches the blue-violet end of the visible spectrum; in other words, the plasmonic frequency of the alkali metals becomes lower from lithium to caesium. Thus caesium transmits and partially absorbs violet light preferentially, while other colors (having lower frequency) are reflected; hence it appears yellowish.

=== Lead–acid battery ===
Without relativity, lead (&quot;Z&quot; = 82) would be expected to behave much like tin (&quot;Z&quot; = 50), so tin–acid batteries should work just as well as the lead–acid batteries commonly used in cars. However, calculations show that about 10 V of the 12 V produced by a 6-cell lead–acid battery arises purely from relativistic effects, explaining why tin–acid batteries do not work.

=== Inert-pair effect ===
In Tl(I) (thallium), Pb(II) (lead), and Bi(III) (bismuth) complexes a 6s2 electron pair exists. The inert pair effect is the tendency of this pair of electrons to resist oxidation due to a relativistic contraction of the 6s orbital.

=== Other effects ===
Additional phenomena commonly caused by relativistic effects are the following:
* The effect of relativistic effects on metallophilic interactions is uncertain. Although Runeberg &quot;et al.&quot; (1999) calculated an attractive effect, Wan &quot;et al.&quot; (2021) instead calculated a repulsive effect.
* The stability of gold and platinum anions in compounds such as caesium auride.
* The slightly reduced reactivity of francium compared with caesium.
* About 10% of the lanthanide contraction is attributed to the relativistic mass of high-velocity electrons and the smaller Bohr radius that results.

<text>Sheldon Leonard Berman (February 3, 1925 – September 1, 2017) was an American comedian, actor, writer, teacher, and lecturer.

He was awarded three gold records for his comedy albums and he won the first Grammy Award for a spoken comedy recording in 1959. In 2008 he was nominated for an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Larry David&#x27;s father on &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm.

Berman taught humor writing at the University of Southern California for more than 20 years.

==Early life and education==
Berman was born in Chicago, the son of Irene (née Marks) and Nathan Berman. He was Jewish. He had a younger brother, Ronald.

He served in the Navy during World War II, after which he enrolled in Chicago&#x27;s Goodman School of Drama at the Art Institute of Chicago (now at DePaul University) as a drama student. There he met fellow student Sarah Herman, whom he married in 1947. His career began with an acting company in Woodstock, Illinois, and in 1949 he and his wife made their way to New York City. He studied acting at the HB Studio and made ends meet as a social director, cab driver, speech teacher, assistant manager of a drug store, and a dance instructor at Arthur Murray Dance Studios. Later, Berman found work as a sketch writer for &quot;The Steve Allen Plymouth Show&quot;.

==Career==
===Early career===
Berman began as a straight actor, receiving his training at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, performing in stock companies in and around Chicago and New York City.

In the mid-1950s, he became a member of Chicago&#x27;s Compass Players, which later evolved into The Second City. While performing improvised sketches with Compass, Berman began to develop solo pieces, often employing an imaginary telephone to take the place of an onstage partner.

===Nightclubs and live performances===
In 1957, Berman was hired as a comedian at Mister Kelly&#x27;s in Chicago, which led to other nightclub bookings, and a recording contract with Verve Records. His comedy albums earned him three gold records and his debut, &quot;Inside Shelley Berman&quot;, won the first Grammy Award for Best Comedy Performance - Spoken. Berman appeared on numerous television specials and all of the major variety shows of the day.

He starred on Broadway in &quot;A Family Affair&quot; and continued with stage work in &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, &quot;Where&#x27;s Charley?&quot;, &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, &quot;Two by Two&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Rappaport&quot;, &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot; and &quot;Guys &amp; Dolls&quot;. On March 12, 1961 he became the first stand-up comedian to perform at Carnegie Hall.

Berman&#x27;s voice was the inspiration for the voice of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character Fibber Fox, performed by Daws Butler.

===Television career===
Berman performed both comedic and dramatic roles on television, including appearances on episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (both radio and TV versions), &quot;Rawhide&quot;,&quot; Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot;,&quot; Emergency!&quot;, &quot;Brothers&quot;, &quot;Night Court&quot;, &quot;MacGyver&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;, &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;, &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;, &quot;&quot; and the revived &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;. 

He made some appearances as a panelist and one as the &quot;Mystery Guest&quot; on the CBS game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; in the early and mid-1960s. He also had a recurring role on the short-lived sitcom &quot;Walter &amp; Emily&quot;. From 2002 to 2009 he appeared as Larry David&#x27;s father on &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, a role for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2008.

===Film career===
Among Berman&#x27;s film credits are &quot;Dementia&quot; (1955, with Shorty Rogers), &quot;The Best Man&quot; (1964, with Henry Fonda and Cliff Robertson), &quot;Divorce American Style&quot; (1967, with Dick Van Dyke and Debbie Reynolds), &quot;Every Home Should Have One&quot; (1970, with Marty Feldman), &quot;Beware! The Blob&quot; (1972, with Robert Walker Jr.), &quot;Rented Lips&quot; (1988, with Martin Mull and Robert Downey Jr.), &quot;Teen Witch&quot; (1989, with Robyn Lively and Zelda Rubinstein), &quot;The Last Producer&quot; (2000, with Burt Reynolds), &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot; (2004, with Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller), &quot;The Holiday&quot; (2006, with Cameron Diaz), and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot; (2008, with Adam Sandler).

===Late career===
For over 20 years, Berman was a lecturer (later lecturer emeritus) in humor writing in the Master of Professional Writing program at the University of Southern California. He was also a teacher for the Improv Olympics program.

==Personal life==
Berman married Sarah Herman on April 19, 1947. The two met while they were studying acting at Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theatre.

In the mid-1960s, Berman and wife Sarah adopted two children, son Joshua and daughter Rachel. The Bermans were planning Joshua&#x27;s bar mitzvah when he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Joshua died on October 29, 1977, at age 12.

Berman and his wife were supporters of the Motion Picture and Television Fund (located in Woodland Hills, California), a charitable organization that offers assistance and care to those in the motion picture and television industries with little or no resources, and contributed their time and resources to benefit the facilities and the residents.

In the 1980s, the Chamber of Commerce in Canoga Park, California selected Berman as one of the celebrities to serve a term as honorary mayor of Canoga Park.

===Allegation of plagiarism===
In a 2012 podcast interview with Marc Maron, Berman alleged that comedian Bob Newhart plagiarized his improvisational telephone routine style, describing its genesis and saying it was a &quot;very special technique that couldn&#x27;t really be imitated. It could be stolen. And it was.&quot; &quot;I was coming to work at night and a guy stopped his car, passed me by, and said &#x27;Hey, Shelley! There&#x27;s a guy [who] stole your act!&#x27;&quot; When asked by Maron if it was done maliciously, Berman replied, &quot;Maliciously? He wouldn&#x27;t do it maliciously. Nobody does that. But he did it to make a living. And he became a star.&quot;

When asked by &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; about the telephone issue, Newhart said:
Shelley Berman did it before I did it. Mike (Nichols) and Elaine (May) did a version of it. There was a thing called &quot;Cohen on the Telephone&quot;, which was a very, very early recording by Edison [Records] of a guy on the phone.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;George Jessel had a radio show,&quot; Mr. Newhart recalled. &quot;At the end, he would call up his mother and tell her how the show had gone. As a kid growing up, I remember listening to him and he would call his mother up and say, &#x27;Mama, this is Georgie&#x27;&quot; – he paused, skillfully – &quot;&#x27;from the money.&#x27;&quot;

Newhart cited other influences on his comedy, rather than Berman -- most notably Jack Benny and Bob and Ray.

==Death==
Berman died from complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at his home in Bell Canyon, California, in the early morning of September 1, 2017. He was 92 years old. His archive was donated to the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, New York.

Comedian Steve Martin praised Berman on Twitter, thanking him for &quot;changing modern stand-up [comedy]&quot;. Marc Maron also tweeted &quot;Shelley Berman has hung up the phone. RIP. The guy who inspired me to sit. Great comic.&quot;

==Career==
===Sunderland===
Born in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, Brown was a prolific goalscorer at school and youth level. Brown rose through the youth ranks at the team he supported as a boy, Sunderland, making his debut for the under-19 team at the age of just 15. However, Brown suffered a setback in 2002 when he damaged his cruciate ligament whilst playing for the reserve side, forcing him to miss the entire 2002–03 season. During this season Sunderland were relegated from the Premier League.

After making a successful recovery, Brown was promoted to the Sunderland first team, and was allocated the number 31 shirt for the club&#x27;s first season back in the First Division. During the season, Brown was loaned to Doncaster Rovers, where he made 22 appearances during his seven-month stay, scoring 10 goals. Brown ended the season with a Third Division medal.

Brown was handed the number 20 squad number at Sunderland for the 2004–05 season, with many tipping Brown to break through into the first team that season as the club bounced back from a play-off defeat to Crystal Palace the year below. Brown was named as an unused substitute for the trip to Plymouth on 21 August and officially Brown made his debut for Sunderland on 21 September, scoring twice in the 3–3 draw with Crewe Alexandra in the League Cup. Although Sunderland lost the game on penalties, Brown impressed enough to retain his place for the trip to Leeds United four days later, with the game resulting in a 1–0 victory for Sunderland.

Brown featured throughout the season for Sunderland, making 14 starts and 23 substitute appearances, scoring 7 goals. Although mainly being used as a substitute during the first half of the season, Brown enjoyed an extended run in the side towards the end of the campaign, as Sunderland clinched the newly renamed Championship title and won promotion. At the end of the season, Brown was beaten by teammate Stephen Elliott for the club&#x27;s &quot;young player of the year&quot; award.

Brown featured for Sunderland during the pre-season tour of US and Canada, though was told by manager Mick McCarthy that he needed to gain further first team experience on loan at another club. Brown made a second-half substitute appearance against Liverpool at Anfield on 20 August and later joined Championship side Hull City on loan on 8 September until January. Brown struggled during his time at the KC Stadium however, scoring once against Reading in 13 appearances, and was recalled by Sunderland in November. After three appearances back at Sunderland however, Brown picked up an injury which would sideline him until March, by which time Sunderland looked destined for relegation after a disaster of a season.

===Norwich City===
Brown completed a £325,000 move to Norwich on 11 January 2007, signing a two-and-a-half-year contract. Upon signing he was allocated the number 14 shirt previously worn by Leon McKenzie. He was sent off for a second bookable offence on his first start for Norwich.

He made his debut as a substitute in the 3–1 league defeat against Plymouth and made his full debut against Blackpool in the FA Cup 4th round although he was sent off in the 2nd half. Shortly after his suspension he suffered a hamstring injury which disrupted the start of his Norwich career.

On 23 October 2007, in his 20th appearance for the club in all competitions, Brown opened his Norwich City account with a goal against Burnley in a 2–1 defeat.

===Preston North End===
On 10 January 2008, Brown completed a £400,000 move to Preston North End. Brown made his debut against Watford and received the man of the match award after an impressive performance.

===Doncaster Rovers===
On 7 July 2011, Brown joined Doncaster Rovers on a free transfer after his contract with Preston North End ended.

===Blackburn Rovers===
On 23 June 2014, Brown signed a two-year deal with Blackburn Rovers. In mid-September, it was reported Chris was going for surgery on his knee and will return within 6 weeks. Brown received a red card after just 10 minutes in a 2–1 Rovers victory away to Newport on 18 January.

Brown was the subject of derision from Rovers fans for failing to score a single goal for the club.

Brown was released by Blackburn Rovers in the summer of 2016.

===Bury===
Brown joined League One side Bury in August 2016, signing a one-year contract with an option for a further year. He did not feature at any level for the first-team due to recovery from knee surgery.

==Personal life==
Brown is a boyhood Sunderland fan who grew up in Peterlee and attended The Academy at Shotton Hall. He is the son of former Sunderland, Newcastle United, Shrewsbury Town and Doncaster striker Alan Brown.

==Controversies==
===Paintball shooting===
On 7 September 2004, shortly before Brown&#x27;s debut for Sunderland, Brown was cautioned by Northumbria Police along with teammates Sean Taylor and Ryan Bell for firing paintballs at passers-by from a car. The trio were initially suspended by the club during investigations, and were fined and handed written warnings for their behaviour. During a statement, the trio said they were &quot;embarrassed&quot; by their behaviour, and apologised for their actions. Brown made his debut the same day his fine was announced on 21 September 2004 and remained a first-team regular until his departure from the club.

===Sex tape scandal===
On 7 December 2006, it was reported that Brown, along with teammates Ben Alnwick and Liam Lawrence had filmed themselves in an orgy with a brunette girl referred to as &#x27;Stevie&#x27;. In the video, Brown films his teammates perform sexual acts on the girl as well as themselves, and is said to give &quot;Match of the Day&quot; style commentary throughout. Former Sunderland midfielder Martin Woods also features on the tape partially clothed, along with two other men. In reference to the watching men, Brown reportedly comments &quot;Here&#x27;s the boys — the watching faithful — every week without fail.&quot;

<text>Chukchansi Park, formerly known as Grizzlies Stadium, is a city-owned baseball stadium located in Fresno, California, United States, completed in 2002 as the home for Minor League Baseball&#x27;s Fresno Grizzlies. The first game was May 1, 2002. Located in downtown Fresno, it was designed to be an anchor in the rehabilitation of the area, as other commercial development is planned in the Central Business District Loop. The ballpark is also used for music concerts, motocross events, and high school football.

==History==
Upon the 1998 arrival of the Grizzlies minor league baseball team in Fresno, a group of developers proposed building a stadium in downtown Fresno as a permanent home for the club. There was extensive debate over how much money the City of Fresno would contribute to the project. Ultimately the stadium was built entirely with public money and then leased back to the owners of the Grizzlies for 30 years at $1.5 million per year.

The stadium was designed by Populous, the firm responsible for many of today&#x27;s sports stadiums like Oriole Park at Camden Yards, Petco Park, Comerica Park and Oracle Park in San Francisco. The $46 million facility seats 10,650, with left field dimensions of ; center field, ; and right field, . The ballpark features 600 club seats and 32 luxury suites

In September 2006, Chukchansi Gold Resort &amp; Casino, affiliated with the Chukchansi tribe, announced it would be the premier corporate sponsor for Grizzlies Stadium, in a 15-year, deal.

In August 2011, the stadium served as a filming location for &quot;Parental Guidance&quot;. During the game, Billy Crystal threw out the first pitch in character and later appeared on the Grizzlies radio broadcast for an inning.

One of the stadium&#x27;s most popular events is an annual &quot;taco truck throwdown&quot; where food trucks compete for best taco according to the event&#x27;s judges. Based on the event, the team designed and wore taco-oriented jerseys.

==Attendance records==
The stadium&#x27;s attendance record was set on July 10, 2015 when Chukchansi Park hosted an exhibition soccer game between Mexican soccer clubs Chivas and Atlas, in front of 16,824 fans. The stadium&#x27;s second attendance record was set on June 27, 2012 when Chukchansi Park hosted an exhibition soccer game between Mexican soccer clubs América and Chiapas of the Primera División, in front of a crowd of 16,125 fans; breaking the previous record set on March 26, 2008 when the Grizzlies played their parent club, the San Francisco Giants, in an exhibition game in front of 14,084 fans.

On March 27, 2015, Liga MX teams Cruz Azul and León faced off an international friendly match in front of a crowd of 15,087 spectators, the third largest crowd recorded at Chukchansi Park.

On May 11, 2012, the Grizzlies fell to the Iowa Cubs in front of 14,023 fans, which is the largest regular season crowd in franchise history.

<doc id="1253793" wikidata="Q1095533" url="?curid=1253793" title="Clarence White">
<text>Clarence White (born Clarence Joseph LeBlanc; June 7, 1944 – July 15, 1973) was an American bluegrass and country guitarist and singer. He is best known as a member of the bluegrass ensemble the Kentucky Colonels and the rock band the Byrds, as well as for being a pioneer of the musical genre of country rock during the late 1960s. White also worked extensively as a session musician, appearing on recordings by the Everly Brothers, Joe Cocker, Ricky Nelson, Pat Boone, the Monkees, Randy Newman, Gene Clark, Linda Ronstadt, Arlo Guthrie, and Jackson Browne among others.

Together with frequent collaborator Gene Parsons, he invented the B-Bender, a guitar accessory that enables a player to mechanically bend the B-string up a whole tone and emulate the sound of a pedal steel guitar. White was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Association Hall of Fame in 2016, and was inducted a second time in 2019 as a member of the Kentucky Colonels.

==Early years==
Clarence Joseph LeBlanc was born on June 7, 1944, in Lewiston, Maine. The LeBlanc family, who later changed their surname to White, were of French-Canadian ancestry and hailed from New Brunswick, Canada. Clarence&#x27;s father, Eric LeBlanc Sr., played guitar, banjo, fiddle, and harmonica, ensuring that his offspring grew up surrounded by music. A child prodigy, Clarence began playing guitar at the age of six. At such a young age he was barely able to hold the instrument and as a result, he briefly switched to ukulele, awaiting a time when his young hands would be big enough to confidently grapple with the guitar.

In 1954, when Clarence was ten, the White family relocated to Burbank, California and soon after, Clarence joined his brothers Roland and Eric Jr. (who played mandolin and banjo respectively) in a trio called Three Little Country Boys. Although they initially started out playing contemporary country music, the group soon switched to a purely bluegrass repertoire, as a result of Roland&#x27;s burgeoning interest in the genre.

In 1957, banjoist Billy Ray Latham and Dobro player LeRoy Mack were added to the line-up, with the band renaming themselves the Country Boys soon after. In 1961, the Country Boys also added Roger Bush on double bass, as a replacement for Eric White Jr. That same year, Clarence and other members of the Country Boys appeared on two episodes of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. Between 1959 and 1962, the group released three singles on the Sundown, Republic, and Briar International record labels.

==The Kentucky Colonels==

Following the recording sessions for the Country Boys&#x27; debut album, the band changed its name to the Kentucky Colonels in September 1962, at the suggestion of country guitarist and friend Joe Maphis. The band&#x27;s album was released by Briar International under the title &quot;The New Sound of Bluegrass America&quot; in early 1963.

Around this time, Clarence&#x27;s flatpicking guitar style was becoming a much more prominent part of the group&#x27;s music. After attending a performance by Doc Watson at the Ash Grove folk club in Los Angeles, where he also met the guitarist, Clarence began to explore the possibilities of the acoustic guitar&#x27;s role in bluegrass music. At that time, the guitar was largely regarded as a rhythm instrument in bluegrass, with only a few performers, such as Watson, exploring its potential for soloing. White soon began to integrate elements of Watson&#x27;s playing style—including the use of open strings and syncopation—into his own flatpicking guitar technique. His breathtaking speed and virtuosity on the instrument was largely responsible for making the guitar a lead instrument within bluegrass.

The Kentucky Colonels became well known on the bluegrass circuit during this period and made many live appearances throughout California and the United States. Between bookings with the Colonels, White also made a guest appearance on Eric Weissberg and Marshall Brickman&#x27;s &quot;New Dimensions in Banjo &amp; Bluegrass&quot; album, which would be re-released in 1973 as the soundtrack album to the film &quot;Deliverance&quot; (with Weissberg and Steve Mandell&#x27;s version of &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot; added to the album&#x27;s track listing).

In 1964, the Colonels recruited fiddle player Bobby Sloan and continued to make live appearances at various clubs, concert halls and festivals. The Colonels&#x27; second album, &quot;Appalachian Swing!&quot;, was a commercial success and saw White&#x27;s flatpicking permanently expand the language of bluegrass guitar. Music critic Thom Owens has remarked that White&#x27;s playing on the album, &quot;helped pioneer a new style in bluegrass; namely, he redefined the acoustic guitar as a solo instrument.&quot;

Shortly after the recording of the &quot;Appalachian Swing!&quot; album, Roland and Clarence undertook some session work backing dobroist Tut Taylor on a Dobro-themed album that was released by World Pacific Records in late 1964 as &quot;Dobro Country&quot;. Although the brothers were employed as session musicians, the album was credited to Tut Taylor, Roland and Clarence White upon release.

Although the Colonels were a successful recording act, it was becoming increasingly difficult for them to make a living, due to the waning popularity of the American folk music revival due to the British Invasion and homegrown folk rock acts, such as the Byrds and Bob Dylan. As a result, the Colonels switched to electric instrumentation and hired a drummer. In spite of these changes, the Kentucky Colonels dissolved as a band following a show on October 31, 1965. Clarence, Roland and Eric Jr. formed a new line-up of the Colonels in 1966, with several other musicians, but this second version of the group was short-lived and by early 1967 they had broken up.

==Session work (1966–1968)==
During 1964, White began to look beyond bluegrass music towards rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll as an avenue for artistic expression. Although he was influenced by Country guitarists like Doc Watson, Don Reno and Joe Maphis, he also idolized the playing of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roller Chuck Berry, and studio musician James Burton. White even anticipated the viability of a folk/rock hybrid when, in the summer of 1964, he was approached by Jim Dickson to record a version of the then-unreleased Bob Dylan song &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; with electric instruments. However, despite White&#x27;s enthusiasm for the project, he was unable to convince his bandmates in the Kentucky Colonels of the experiment&#x27;s validity and ultimately, the song was instead recorded by Dickson&#x27;s proteges, the Byrds.

By the time the original line-up of the Kentucky Colonels folded in late 1965, White had become a respected and well-known guitarist. Abandoning bluegrass temporarily, he switched from his Martin D-28 acoustic guitar to an electric Fender Telecaster, with the intention of becoming a studio musician like his hero James Burton. Transitioning to electric guitar required White to modify his right hand playing technique, switch from open chording to fretting the whole guitar neck with his left hand, and practice using the tone and volume controls. However, he soon mastered the intricacies of the instrument and, between 1965 and 1968, he undertook session work for artists including Ricky Nelson, the Monkees, and the Gosdin Brothers. 
As 1965 turned into 1966, White met Gene Parsons and Gib Guilbeau at a recording session for the Gosdin Brothers and, shortly after, he began to perform live with the duo in local California clubs, as well as doing regular session work on their records, which were released under the moniker of Cajun Gib and Gene. 1966 also saw White begin playing with a country group called Trio, which featured drummer Bart Haney and former Kentucky Colonel, Roger Bush, on bass. In autumn of that year, as a result of his friendship with Gilbeau, Parsons and the Gosdin Brothers, White was asked to provide lead guitar to ex-Byrd Gene Clark&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers&quot;. White briefly joined Clark&#x27;s touring band shortly thereafter.

During the Clark album sessions, White reconnected with mandolin player and bassist Chris Hillman, who he had known during the early 1960s as a member of the bluegrass combo the Hillmen. Hillman was currently a member of the Byrds and, in December 1966, he invited White to contribute countrified lead guitar playing to his songs &quot;Time Between&quot; and &quot;The Girl with No Name&quot;, which both appeared on the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot; album. The country-oriented nature of the songs was something of a stylistic departure for the group and can be seen as an early indicator of the experimentation with country music that would color the Byrds&#x27; subsequent work. White also contributed guitar to the band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot;, and to their seminal 1968 country rock release, &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;.

==Nashville West==
By mid-1967, White had begun performing at night in the band the Reasons (a.k.a. Nashville West), which included bass player Wayne Moore, along with Parsons and Guilbeau (as banjoist-turned-drummer and lead singer respectively). The band mostly worked at the Nashville West club in El Monte, California, frequently borrowing the club&#x27;s name as their own. Critic Erik Hage has said that, in the years since their formation, the band have become legendary as one of the first to play a seamless blend of country and rock, although L.A. group the International Submarine Band, which featured country rock pioneer Gram Parsons (no relation to Gene), were also exploring a similar sound concurrently.

A live recording of Nashville West would eventually be released in 1979, which music historian Richie Unterberger later described as being &quot;of considerable historical interest for anyone interested in the roots of country-rock&quot;. Unterberger also remarked that the recording illustrated Nashville West as having &quot;more electric rock influences than most country acts were using at the time.&quot; In addition to being a member of Nashville West, White was also a member of another country bar band that regularly played at the Nashville West club called the Roustabouts.

In July 1967, White signed with Gary Paxton&#x27;s Bakersfield International record label and released a pair of solo singles: &quot;Tango for a Sad Mood&quot; b/w &quot;Tuff and Stringy&quot; and &quot;Grandma Funderbunks Music Box&quot; b/w &quot;Riff Raff&quot;. He also reportedly recorded a solo album for the label, although it has never been released.

==The StringBender==
During 1967, while they were both members of Nashville West, White and Parsons invented a device that enabled Clarence to simulate the sound of a pedal steel guitar on his 1954 Fender Telecaster. The need for such a device was driven by White&#x27;s desire to bend his guitar&#x27;s B-string up a full tone, while keeping his left hand on the strings and fretboard. In order to achieve this feat, White felt that he needed a third hand. The guitarist turned to his friend Parsons, who was an amateur machinist, and asked him to design and build an apparatus to pull or drop the B-string.

The device, which was known as the Parsons/White StringBender (also known as the B-Bender), was a spring-lever mechanism built into the inside of White&#x27;s guitar, which linked to the guitar&#x27;s strap button and the B-string. When it was activated, by pulling down on the guitar neck, it pulled on the B-string and caused the guitar to simulate the &quot;crying&quot; sound of a pedal steel. White would go on to use the device extensively as a member of the Byrds and, as a result, the distinctive sound of the StringBender would become a defining characteristic of that band&#x27;s music during White&#x27;s tenure with the group.

==The Byrds==

Following the abrupt departure from the Byrds of singer and guitarist Gram Parsons in July 1968, White was invited to join the group as a full-time member. He remained until the band was finally dissolved by lead guitarist Roger McGuinn in February 1973. This extended tenure with the band makes White the second longest-serving member of the Byrds after McGuinn. White was brought into the group at bass player Chris Hillman&#x27;s suggestion, as someone who could handle the band&#x27;s older rock material and their newer country-flavored repertoire.

Once he was a member of the Byrds, White began to express dissatisfaction with the band&#x27;s current drummer, Kevin Kelley. Before long, he had persuaded McGuinn and Hillman to replace Kelley with his friend from the recently dissolved Nashville West, Gene Parsons (no relation to Gram).

Hillman quit the Byrds within a month of White joining, in order to form the Flying Burrito Brothers with Gram Parsons. At around this same time, White and Gene Parsons undertook some informal rehearsing and recording with Hillman and Gram Parsons, as part of a prototype version of the Burrito Brothers. However, the pair declined an invitation to join the new country rock group and instead opted to stay with McGuinn&#x27;s new-look Byrds.
The White-era version of the Byrds, featuring McGuinn, White and Parsons, along with bassists John York (September 1968–September 1969) and Skip Battin (September 1969–February 1973), released five albums and toured relentlessly between 1969 and 1972. Journalist Steve Leggett has noted that, although the original line-up of the Byrds gets the most attention and praise, the latter-day version—featuring McGuinn and White&#x27;s dual lead guitar work—was regarded by critics and audiences as much more accomplished in concert than any previous configuration of the band had been. Similarly, authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz have commented that although the White-era Byrds failed to achieve the commercial success of the original line-up, the group were a formidable live act and a consistently in-demand attraction on the touring circuit. The authors also cited the Byrds&#x27; archival release &quot;Live at the Fillmore – February 1969&quot; as a good example of the White-era band&#x27;s musical potency. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist David Fricke has commented on White&#x27;s contribution to the band by noting, &quot;with his powerful, impeccable tone and melodic ingenuity, White did much to rebuild the creative reputation of the Byrds and define the road-hearty sound of the group at the turn of the &#x27;70s.&quot;

The first Byrds&#x27; album to feature White as a full member was &quot;Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde&quot;, which was released in early 1969. The album included a re-recording of the Gene Parsons and White-penned instrumental &quot;Nashville West&quot;, as well as a rendition of the traditional song &quot;Old Blue&quot;, which was the first Byrds&#x27; recording to utilize the StringBender. The &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot; album followed in November 1969, on which White could be heard leading the band through a rendition of the traditional song &quot;Oil in My Lamp&quot;, representing the guitarist&#x27;s first lead vocal performance as a Byrd.

1970 saw the Byrds release the double album &quot;(Untitled)&quot;, which consisted of one LP of live concert recordings and another of new studio recordings. Upon release, the album was a critical and commercial success on both sides of the Atlantic, peaking at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart and reaching number 11 on the UK Albums Chart. Two of the album&#x27;s studio recordings featured White singing lead vocals: a cover version of the Lowell George composition &quot;Truck Stop Girl&quot; and a rendition of Leadbelly&#x27;s &quot;Take a Whiff on Me&quot; (the latter also featured White playing mandolin). In addition, excerpts from an instrumental jam, recorded during the &quot;(Untitled)&quot; album sessions and logged in the Columbia Records&#x27; files under the title of &quot;Fifteen Minute Jam&quot;, were later released as &quot;White&#x27;s Lightning&quot; and &quot;White&#x27;s Lightning Pt.2&quot; on &quot;The Byrds&quot; box set and the remastered double CD version of &quot;(Untitled)&quot; respectively.
The 1971 &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot; album saw White singing lead vocals on &quot;My Destiny&quot;, written by Helen Carter, and &quot;Jamaica Say You Will&quot;, penned by the then little-known songwriter Jackson Browne. In addition, White received a co-writing credit for the album&#x27;s bluegrass instrumental &quot;Green Apple Quick Step&quot;. This song also featured White&#x27;s father, Eric White Sr., on harmonica.

&quot;Farther Along&quot;, released in November 1971, would prove to be the final album by the White-era Byrds. It featured White singing the Gospel hymn and title track &quot;Farther Along&quot; and a cover of the Larry Murray composition &quot;Bugler&quot;. This latter song features White playing mandolin and has been described by Byrds expert Tim Connors as, &quot;the best song on the album, and by far the best vocal ever recorded by Clarence White during his time with the Byrds.&quot;

Following the release of &quot;Farther Along&quot;, the band continued to tour throughout 1972, but no new Byrds album appeared. In late 1972, the original five-piece line-up of the Byrds reunited and, as a result, McGuinn decided to disband the existing version of the band. Parsons had been fired in July 1972 and Battin was dismissed by McGuinn in early 1973. The last concert by the White-era version of the Byrds (which at this point featured former Byrd Chris Hillman on bass and Joe Lala on drums) was given on February 24, 1973, at The Capitol Theatre, Passaic, New Jersey, with White and McGuinn jokingly firing each other from the band afterwards.

Despite being on tour or in the recording studio with the Byrds for the majority of the time between 1969 and 1972, White continued to undertake selected session work for other recording artists. During this period he played on Joe Cocker&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Joe Cocker!&quot;, Randy Newman&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;12 Songs&quot;, and the Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;Stories We Could Tell&quot; from 1972. In early 1971, White also contributed guitar to Paul Siebel&#x27;s &quot;Jack-Knife Gypsy&quot; album and the title track of the &quot;L.A. Getaway&quot; album by Joel Scott-Hill, John Barbata and Chris Ethridge. Other albums that White contributed his guitar playing to while he was a member of the Byrds include Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s &quot;Hand Sown ... Home Grown&quot; (1969), Rita Coolidge&#x27;s &quot;Rita Coolidge&quot; (1971), Marc Benno&#x27;s &quot;Minnows&quot; (1971), Jackson Browne&#x27;s &quot;Jackson Browne&quot; (1972), Gene Clark&#x27;s &quot;Roadmaster&quot; (1973), and a trio of Arlo Guthrie albums: &quot;Running Down the Road&quot; (1969), &quot;Washington County&quot; (1970) and &quot;Hobo&#x27;s Lullaby&quot; (1972).

==Post-Byrds==

In mid-February 1973, just prior to the break up of the White-era version of the Byrds, White joined with guitarist Peter Rowan, mandolinist David Grisman, fiddler Richard Greene, and banjoist Bill Keith to form the bluegrass supergroup Muleskinner. The musicians initially assembled as a one-off pickup band to back bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe for a television program, but ended up performing on their own when Monroe&#x27;s tour bus broke down on the way to the television studios. A recording of this broadcast, which was once thought lost, was released as an album in 1992, under the title &quot;Muleskinner Live&quot;. A VHS video cassette of the broadcast was also released in 1992 and later re-issued on DVD.

As a result of the success of their appearance on the television broadcast, the band was offered a one album recording contract with Warner Bros. Records. Sessions for the album took place at the Record Plant in Los Angeles between March 27 and April 14, 1973, with Richard Greene and Joe Boyd producing. The music the band recorded for the &quot;Muleskinner&quot; album (a.k.a. &quot;A Potpourri of Bluegrass Jam&quot;) was in the vein of country rock, traditional bluegrass and progressive bluegrass (or &quot;newgrass&quot;). It was also one of the first bluegrass albums to feature a full drum kit. The album was released in the latter half of 1973 and is nowadays regarded by critics as a milestone in the development of progressive bluegrass, with ex-band members Greene, Keith, Grisman, and Rowan all going on to become important figures in the development of that genre.

In addition to his work with Muleskinner, White also undertook a number of sessions between late 1972 and early 1973 for his friend Gene Parsons&#x27; debut solo album &quot;Kindling&quot;. White&#x27;s distinctive guitar and mandolin playing can be heard on the tracks &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot;, &quot;On the Spot&quot;, &quot;Sonic Bummer&quot;, &quot;I Must Be a Tree&quot;, &quot;Banjo Dog&quot;, &quot;Back Again&quot;, and &quot;Drunkard&#x27;s Dream&quot; (the latter of which also features White contributing harmony vocals).

Following completion of the &quot;Muleskinner&quot; album in April 1973, White reunited with his brothers Roland and Eric Jr. for a tour as the White Brothers (a.k.a. The New Kentucky Colonels). After playing a handful of shows in California, the White Brothers departed for Europe in May 1973.

Returning to the U.S., White&#x27;s final bout of touring took place with the New Kentucky Colonels in June 1973, as part of a four-date country rock package tour with Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, Country Gazette, Sneaky Pete Kleinow, Gene Parsons, Byron Berline, and Chris Ethridge among others. Although Gram and Clarence had been acquainted with one another since the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; sessions, the pair would develop a fast friendship during the mini-tour, after a very acrimonious re-acquaintance. Following the end of the package tour, White entered the recording studio with producer Jim Dickson on June 28 and 29, 1973 to begin work on a solo album. He recorded a total of six songs, four of which would belatedly be released on the archival album &quot;Silver Meteor: A Progressive Country Anthology&quot; in 1980.

==Death==
White died on July 15, 1973, after being struck by a drunk driver. The accident occurred shortly after 2 a.m., while he and his brother Roland were loading equipment into their car in Palmdale, California, following a White Brothers concert. Clarence was survived by, his wife Susie, daughter Michelle, and son Bradley. He has five grandchildren. Gram Parsons was especially shaken by his death; he led a singalong of &quot;Farther Along&quot; at White&#x27;s funeral service and later conceived his final song (before his own death), &quot;In My Hour of Darkness&quot;, as a partial tribute to White.

==Musical influence==
Clarence White helped popularize the acoustic guitar as a lead instrument in bluegrass music, building on the work of guitarists such as Doc Watson. Prior to the advent of the more aggressive flatpicking style pioneered by guitarists like Watson and White, the guitar was strictly a rhythm instrument, save for a few exceptions (such as the occasional guitar track by banjoist Don Reno). Many of the most influential flatpickers of the 20th century cite White as a primary influence, including Dan Crary, Norman Blake, and Tony Rice. Rice owned and played White&#x27;s highly modified 1935 Martin D-28. David Grier and Russ Barenberg are two other acoustic guitarists who were heavily influenced by White&#x27;s guitar work. White&#x27;s bluegrass playing with the Kentucky Colonels was also a considerable influence on Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, who traveled with the band during 1964.

On the electric side of the guitar spectrum, White was similarly influential. Together with fellow Byrds bandmember Gene Parsons, White invented the B-Bender device. This device raises the B-string (second string) of the guitar a whole step by the use of pulleys and levers attached to both the upper strap knob and the second string on the guitar. It is activated by pushing down on the neck, and produces a &quot;pedal steel&quot; type sound. Arlen Roth, heavily influenced by this style, did not at the time know that White and Parsons had invented a B-bender, so instead developed his own unique all-finger bending version of this technique. This was heavily documented in his ground-breaking book, &quot;Nashville Guitar&quot;, all of his recordings, as well as his book &quot;Masters of the Telecaster&quot;. Subsequently, his Telecaster sound became as notable as his bluegrass playing. Marty Stuart, another guitarist influenced by White&#x27;s playing, now owns and regularly plays White&#x27;s 1954 Fender Telecaster with the prototype B-Bender.

Music archivist and writer Alec Palao has called White &quot;one of a handful of true greats amongst the instrumentalists of 20th century popular music&quot;, before adding that &quot;the waves created by the guitarist&#x27;s idiosyncratic style are still forming ripples within bluegrass, country and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; In 2003, White was ranked No. 41 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. In 2010, guitar manufacturer Gibson ranked White at No. 42 on their Top 50 Guitarists of All Time list.

<doc id="1253797" wikidata="Q940855" url="?curid=1253797" title="Black Hundreds">
<text>The Black Hundreds were reactionary, monarchist, and ultra-nationalist groups in Russia in the early 20th century. They were staunch supporters of the House of Romanov, and opposed any retreat from the autocracy of the reigning monarch. Their name arose from the medieval concept of &quot;black&quot;, or common (non-noble) people, organized into militias.

The Black Hundreds were noted for extremism and incitement to pogroms, nationalistic Russocentric doctrines, as well as various xenophobic beliefs, including anti-Ukrainian sentiment, anti-Polish sentiment, and anti-Semitism.

The ideology of the movement is based on a slogan formulated by Count Sergey Uvarov: &quot;Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality&quot;.

==Terminology==
The term was intended to be pejorative in revolutionary newspapers, but adherents used it in their own literature. They traced the term back to the &quot;black lands&quot;, where peasants, merchants, and craftsmen paid taxes to the government (lands owned by the nobility and church were called &quot;white lands&quot;), and the term &quot;hundred&quot; (&quot;sotnya&quot;) was used to refer to a feudal administrative division. In the right wing extremist imagination, it was the loyal people of the Black Hundreds who gathered to fight Poles and traitors when it was needed.

Revolutionary newspapers identified the Black Hundreds as a threat, describing them as &quot;hooligan gangs&quot; paid by the government to threaten political opponents. The Menshevik leader Julius Martov feared that the government would bribe lower class individuals to act against the social revolutionaries of the time. The term &quot;Black Hundreds&quot; started to appear in newspapers around 1905, along with warnings that the government would mobilize the Black Hundreds in pursuit of mass murder, and would even resort to inciting anti-Jewish pogroms and strife between different religious groups. They alleged that the Black Hundreds were being organized by the police, and called for resistance. The term became more closely associated with pogrom-like violence after thousands of people were killed in attacks on demonstrations, public assemblies, and in the anti-Semitic pogroms that followed the October Manifesto.

==Precursors==
* &quot;Svjashchjennaja druzhina&quot; (Священнaя дружинa, or the Holy Brigade) and &quot;Russkoye sobraniye&quot; (Русское собрание, or Russian Assembly) in Saint Petersburg are considered by the Russian historian Anatoly Stepanov to be predecessors of the Black Hundreds. Starting in 1900, the two organizations united representatives of conservative intellectuals, government officials, Russian Orthodox clergy and landowners. A number of Black Hundred organizations formed during and after the Russian Revolution of 1905, such as:
* &quot;&quot;Soyuz russkogo naroda&quot; (Союз русского народа, or Union of the Russian People) in St. Petersburg,
* &quot;Soyuz russkikh lyudey&quot; (Союз русских людей, or Union of the Russians) in Moscow,
* &quot;Russkaya monarkhicheskaya partiya&quot; (Русская монархическая партия, or Russian Monarchist Party) in Moscow and elsewhere,
* &quot;Obshchestvo aktivnoy borby s revolyutsiyey&quot; (Общество активной борьбы с революцией, or Society of Active Struggle Against Revolution) in Moscow,
* &quot;Belyy dvuglavyy oryol&quot;&quot; (Белый двуглавый орёл, or White Two-headed Eagle) in Odessa,
and others.

==Support Base==
Members of the Black Hundred organizations came from different social strata—such as landowners, clergymen, the high and petty bourgeoisie, merchants, artisans, workers, and the so-called &quot;declassed elements&quot;. The &quot;Postoyanny Sovyet Ob&#x27;yedinnyonnykh dvoryanskikh obshchshestv Rossii&quot; (United Gentry Council) guided the activities of the black-hundredists; the Tsarist regime provided moral and financial support to the movement. The Black Hundreds were founded on a devotion to the Tsar, church, and motherland, expressed previously by the motto of Tsar Nicholas I: &quot;Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality&quot; (&quot;Pravoslaviye, Samoderzhaviye i Narodnost&quot;). The Black Hundreds conducted oral propaganda: in churches by holding special services and during meetings, lectures, and demonstrations. Such propaganda provoked anti-Semitic sentiments and monarchic &quot;exaltation&quot; and incited pogroms and terrorist acts, performed by the Black Hundreds&#x27; paramilitary groups, sometimes known as &quot;Yellow Shirts&quot;.

==Popularity and power==
The Black Hundred movement published newspapers, such as &quot;Znamya&quot; (The Banner) or &quot;Russkoye znamya&quot; (Russian Banner), &quot;Pochayevsky Listok&quot; (The Pochayev Page), &quot;Zemshchina&quot;, &quot;Kolokol&quot; (Bell), &quot;Groza&quot; (Thunderstorm), &quot;Veche&quot; (Popular Assembly) and others. Many rightist newspapers, such as &quot;Moskovskiye vedomosti&quot; (Moscow News), &quot;Grazhdanin&quot; (Citizen) and &quot;Kievlyanin&quot; (Kievan), published their materials as well. Among the prominent leaders of the Black Hundred movement were Alexander Dubrovin, Vladimir Purishkevich, Nikolai Markov, A. I. Trishatny, Pavel Krushevan, Pavel Bulatsel, Ivan Vostorgov, M. K. Shakhovskoy, Saint John of Kronstadt, Hieromonk Iliodor, Bishop Hermogen, and others.

==Incitement to violence==

When two Duma delegates, Grigori Iollos (Poltava province) and Mikhail Herzenstein (b. 1859, d. 1906 in Terijoki), both from the Constitutional Democratic Party, were assassinated by members of the Black Hundreds, their press organ &quot;Russkoe Znamya&quot; declared openly that &quot;Real Russians assassinated Herzenstein and Iollos with knowledge of officials&quot;, and expressed regret that &quot;only two Jews perished in the crusade against revolutionaries.&quot; The black hundred were known to have used violence and torture on anyone they believed was a threat to the Tsar.

Members of the Black Hundreds carried out raids (with unofficial government approval) against various revolutionary groups and pogroms, including inciting pogroms against Jews.

The historian of the Black Hundred movement Sergei Stepanov, writes that after the 1905 Russian Revolution, fighting squads of the Union of the Russian People and other extremist right-wing organizations became the weapons of the Black Hundred terror.

==Fight against the Black Hundreds==
Radical socialist parties organized revolutionary terror in retaliation to the Black Hundred activities. Vladimir Lenin, leader of the Bolshevik faction of the RSDLP wrote in 1905: 

The fight against the Black Hundreds is an excellent type of military action, which will &quot;train&quot; the soldiers of the revolutionary army, give them their baptism of fire, and at the same time be of tremendous benefit to the revolution. Revolutionary army groups must at once find out who organises the Black Hundreds and where and how they are organised, and then, without confining themselves to propaganda (which is useful but inadequate) they must act with armed force, beat up and kill the members of the Black-Hundred gangs, blow up their headquarters, etc., etc.

On behalf of the Saint Petersburg Committee of the RSDLP, an armed attack was carried out on the Tver tea house, where the workers of the Nevsky Shipbuilding Plant, who were members of the Union of the Russian People, gathered. First, two bombs were thrown by the Bolshevik militants, and then those who ran out of the teahouse were shot with revolvers. The Bolsheviks killed two and wounded fifteen people.

Revolutionary organizations carried out many other terrorist acts, mainly against the chairmen of local departments of the Union of the Russian People. So, according to the police department, only in March 1908 in one Chernihiv province in the city of Bakhmach, a bomb was thrown at the house of the chairman of the local union of the RNC, in the city of Nizhyn the house of the chairman of the union was set on fire. The whole family died, in the village of Domyany the department&#x27;s chairman was killed, two chairmen of departments were killed in Nizhyn.

The Socialist-Revolutionaries also killed prominent Black Hundreds such as Nikolai Bogdanovich and Gavril Luzhenovsky.

==Black Hundred and the Ukrainian question==
The Black Hundreds classified Ukrainians as Russians, and attracted the support of many Russophiles who considered themselves Russian and rejected Ukrainian nationalism and a Ukrainian identity. The Black Hundred movement actively campaigned against what it considered to be Ukrainian separatism, as well as against promoting Ukrainian culture and language in general, and against the works of Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko, in particular. In Odessa, the Black Hundreds shut down the local branch of the Ukrainian Prosvita society. This organization was dedicated to spreading literacy in the Ukrainian language and Ukrainian cultural awareness.

==All-Russian congresses==
The Black Hundreds organized four all-Russian congresses to unite their forces. In October 1906, they elected the so-called &quot;glavnaya uprava&quot; (a kind of board of directors) of the new all-Russian Black Hundred organization &quot;Ob’yedinyonniy russkiy narod&quot; (Объединённый русский народ, or Russian People United). After 1907, however, this organization disintegrated, and the whole Black Hundreds movement became weaker as the membership rate steadily declined. After the February Revolution 1917, the remaining Black Hundred organizations were officially abolished.

After emigrating abroad, many Black Hundreds were among the main critics of the White movement. They blamed the movement for not only failing to stress monarchism as its key ideological foundation but also supposedly being run under the influence of classical liberals and Freemasons. Boris Brasol (1885–1963), a former member of the Black Hundreds, was among those who later emigrated to the United States. There he befriended industrialist Henry Ford, who gave Brasol a job on &quot;The Dearborn Independent&quot; newspaper. Brasol also helped in the production of anti-Jewish propaganda such as &quot;The International Jew&quot;.

==Modern version==

After the fall of the Soviet Union, the nationalist and monarchist movements were reborn in Russian society. In 1992, Alexander Shtilmark (former member of Pamyat) decided to found a modern Black Hundred movement.

The movement maintains contacts with other Russian nationalist organizations (like the Russian Imperial Movement and the Union of Orthodox Banner-Bearers) and also participated in the early stages of the Russo-Ukrainian War on the side of pro-Russian separatists.

==In popular culture==
* In Jack London&#x27;s 1908 novel &quot;The Iron Heel&quot;, which predicts the rise of a hypothetical fascist regime in the US, the regime&#x27;s anti-labor hired thugs use the name of the Black Hundreds.
* In Bernard Malamud&#x27;s 1966 novel &quot;The Fixer&quot;, which portrays Yakov Bok as a Jewish man who survived the pogrom and moved to Kyiv, Yakov changes his last name to sound more Russian and soon becomes hired by a member of the Black Hundred.
* In Edward Rutherfurd&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;Russka&quot;, a young Bobrov (one of the fictional families portrayed in the novel) is beaten in the street by a gang of young Black Hundreds for being Jewish-looking and being the son of a social democrat.
* In &quot;&quot;, a Jewish friend of the series&#x27; black protagonists jokes that the Ku Klux Klansmen who burn down his shop are mere pikers next to the &quot;Czar&#x27;s Black One Hundred&quot;.
* In Anatoli Rybakov&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;Children of the Arbat&quot;, in part II, chapter 13, set in Moscow in the mid-1930s, the Sharoks&#x27; old neighbourhood Okhotny Row is described as having many storekeepers who had been Black Hundreds. In part III, chapter 5, Khanlar Safaraliyev, an oil worker, is killed by thugs who belong to a gang of Black Hundreds; Joseph Stalin makes a speech at his graveside.

<text>Charles Ganilh (6 January 1758 – 1836) was a French economist and politician.

He was born at Allanche in Cantal. He was educated for a profession in law and practised as &quot;avocat&quot;. During the troubled period which culminated in the taking of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, he became prominent in public affairs, and was one of the seven members of the permanent Committee of Public Safety.

Ganilh was imprisoned during the Reign of Terror and was only released by the counter-revolution of the 9th Thermidor. During the first consulate he was called to the tribunate but was excluded in 1802.
In 1815 he was elected deputy for Cantal and finally left the Chamber on its dissolution in 1823.

Ganilh is best known as the most vigorous defender of the mercantile school in opposition to the views of Adam Smith and the English economists.

The mercantilists were believers in nations keeping a positive balance of trade at all times in order to prosper, economically. However, they also valued the maximization of the national domestic resources of that nation and a total ban on the export of gold and silver. In pursuit of the positive balance of trade they recommended expansion of the colonial system, exclusivity of trade with the colonies and forbidding trade carried in foreign ships. Britain attempted to follow the mercantilists&#x27; suggestions and found themselves involved in frequent trade wars like the four Anglo-Dutch Navigation Wars.

On the scale of the individual sale, the mercantilists believed that profit arose only during the sale of commodities by the seller over-charging the buyer. Thus, Ganilh says that &quot;exchange or trade alone gives value to things.&quot; In his mercantile outlook, Ganilh rejected the general labor theory of Adam Smith and David Ricardo in which commodities have value from the beginning. Commodities obtain value only through the labor that is used to prepare the commodity for market. 
His works on political economy are clear and concise. His writings include &quot;Essai politique sur le revenue des peuples de l&#x27;antiquité, du moyen âge, &amp;c.&quot; (1808), &quot;Des systèmes d&#x27;économie politique&quot; (1809), &quot;Théorie d&#x27;économie politique&quot; (1815), and &quot;Dictionnaire analytique d&#x27;économie politique&quot; (1826).

<text>The Brunei national football team (; recognised as Brunei Darussalam by FIFA), nicknamed &quot;Tebuan&quot; (The Wasps), is the national team of Brunei, controlled by the Football Association of Brunei Darussalam. The team was founded in 1959 and joined FIFA in 1969. In the past, they have also frequently featured in the Malaysian league and cup competitions as one of the state representative sides.

The Brunei State Football Amateur Association was formed on 15 March 1956. In 1993, the word &quot;Amateur&quot; was dropped, and they were known as the Brunei Football Association. Brunei&#x27;s experience of international football has been more or less restricted to regional Asian competitions, such as the Southeast Asian Games and the AFF Championship. So far, Brunei has entered the FIFA World Cup qualifiers only four times, in 1986, 2002, 2018 and 2022. On these occasions, they did not qualify for the competition. They have made seven appearances in the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, entering the third round for the first time via the play-off round in 2024.

==History==

=== Early days ===

The national team&#x27;s first appearance took place during the 1972 AFC Asian Cup qualification, where they were unable to qualify after all three heavy defeats. The following two championships (1976 and 1977) were no different from the first, with their first and second victory during the 1980 Summer Olympics. In 1979, Brunei entered a team to compete in the professional Malaysian league and despite competing against Malaysian clubs, Brunei had previously never made an impact. However, in 1999, they shocked everyone by lifting the Malaysia Cup.

Brunei became the runners-up of the Brunei Merdeka Games trophy in 1985. Since then, team was not able to qualify into or win any major tournaments. Coming the closest was the 1993 Philippines International Cup, where they came in third position after a 1–0 victory against the Philippines. Brunei was then invited for the inaugural 2006 AFC Challenge Cup held in Bangladesh being grouped with Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Nepal. Brunei narrowly lost to Sri Lanka 1–0 before bouncing back from their defeat in the second match winning against Nepal 2–1 however with them needing the win in the last fixture, Brunei ended up in a goalless draw crashing out from the cup splitting the same points as Nepal but on goal differences.

===Suspension===
In September 2009, the Brunei Football Association (BAFA) was suspended due to governmental interference in its affairs, which started with a decision by the Brunei authorities to dissolve BAFA and to replace it with a new federation in December 2008. The suspension was applied with immediate effect and meant that the Brunei club DPMM were no longer permitted to play in the Singapore S.League until it was resolved. DPMM has confirmed to Football Association of Singapore (FAS) that they are unable to finish their S.League season because of the issue with its association. FIFA rejected FAS&#x27;s final request on 17 October 2009 to permit DPMM to compete in the current S.League season while BAFA&#x27;s suspension persisted.

On 19 March 2010, the FIFA Executive Committee agreed to submit to the next FIFA Congress the expulsion of the association if the BAFA has not been reinstated by then, after noting that no major progress had been made since the BAFA was suspended in September 2009. FIFA warned that unless BAFA came to FIFA&#x27;s Congress on 9 and 10 June in South Africa having met the conditions for reinstatement it would be expelled. Brunei were re-instated on 31 May 2011 and the National Football Association of Brunei Darussalam (NFABD) was formed that same year.

===Reform===

Upon returning to the football action, the Wasps were unable to qualify for both the 2012 and 2014 AFF Championship following several losses. Brunei was again defeated 2–1 in aggregate against the Chinese Taipei during the 2018 FIFA World Cup Qualification in March 2015. The wasps failed to qualify for the 2016 AFF Championship after suffering defeats from Cambodia and Laos. Brunei was then invited to the 2016 AFC Solidarity Cup where they finished in fourth place after losing 3–2 to Laos. Despite the disappointment, Shah Razen Said from the Bruneian side managed to become the tournament&#x27;s top scorer, finishing with a total of 4 goals.

Timor-Leste defeated Brunei in the second leg 2018 AFF Championship qualifying match at the Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium on 8 September 2018, securing their spot in the 2018 AFF Championship final round group action for the first time in 14 years. Despite having a two-goal advantage from the first leg, Timor-Leste fell 1–0 but still advanced with a 3–2 aggregate score. Brunei defeated Mongolia 2–1 on 11 June 2019, but were unable to advance to the next stage of the preliminary joint qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

=== Return to the AFF Championship ===
Under new coach Mario Rivera, Brunei managed to qualify to the 2022 AFF Championship for the first time in 26 years since its inaugural edition in 1996, by defeating Timor-Leste 6–3 on aggregate. The Wasps were grouped with Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Cambodia. They finished the group stage without gaining a single point, conceding at least 5 goals in every game with Razimie Ramlli scoring against the Philippines and Nur Ikhwan Othman scoring against Cambodia.

On 17 October 2023, Brunei returned to the Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium after four years since their last match against Mongolia in 2019 for their fixture against Indonesia in the first round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification. The Wasps were beaten 0–12 on aggregate, knocking them out of the qualification in the first round.

=== 2024 win streak ===
In 2024, FIFA invited Brunei to the 2024 FIFA Series held in March in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia where they would face their first ever opponents outside of their confederation. On 22 March, Brunei faced off against CONCACAF opponent Bermuda but conceded two late goals, losing 2–0. Four days later, Brunei came against Vanuatu and won the match 3–2, when three minutes into stoppage time Hakeme Yazid Said&#x27;s direct free kick sealed the victory against their opponents from Oceania.

Later in June of that year, Brunei invited the Sri Lanka national team to two friendly matches in the country in conjunction with the FIFA calendar. Headed by interim coach Rui Capela Batista, Brunei extended their winning form to three which is the first time in their history after captain Azwan Ali Rahman scored the only goal in both games held at the Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium on 8 and 11 June respectively.

The following September, Brunei registered two wins against Macau with an aggregate of 4–0 during the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualification play-off round to further stretch the streak to five games and thus gaining their spot at the third qualification round of the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualification. The following month, they failed to qualify for the 2024 ASEAN Championship, losing to Timor-Leste 0–1 on aggregate.

== Team image ==
=== Kit ===
Brunei had initially worn a predominantly yellow pattern as their home kit adorned with white or black since their inception in 1956 to represent the colours of their flags. The current kit manufacturer is Puma which was incorporated since 2024.

=== Home stadium ===
Brunei&#x27;s home stadium is the Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium in Bandar Seri Begawan. The stadium capacity is 28,000. From 2021 to 2022, Brunei used the Track &amp; Field Sports Complex as an alternative stadium as their main stadium went for a renovation works for improvement however as the Track &amp; Field Sports Complex does not meet the required standards, Brunei chose the Kuala Lumpur Stadium in Malaysia as their home ground for their 2022 AFF Championship matches.

<text>The kingdom of Agwe (aka the Ewe state of Agwe) was an African state created by the Ewe ethnic group in the territory of present-day Benin and Togo, in 1812. It had territories that were divided between France and Germany. France established the protectorate in 1895, and Germany in 1896. The kingdom was abolished but the two powers eventually considered their reestablishment in 1901. The kingdom was definitively abolished in 1949.

==Playing career==

===Oxford United===
Born in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, Whitehead started his career with Abingdon Town&#x27;s youth team, before joining the youth scheme of his local professional Football League club, Oxford United as an apprentice.

He progressed through the ranks, making his first-team debut in a 2–0 win over Luton Town in the Football League Trophy on 7 December 1999. This turned out to be Whitehead&#x27;s only appearance of the 1999–00 season, as he spent the rest of the season on the substitute bench. At the end of the 1999–00 season, he signed a contract with the club.

In the 2000–01 season, Whitehead soon received a handful of first-team appearances for the club by manager Denis Smith. Although he received his first-team opportunities, he found himself in a competition with Matt Murphy and other midfielders for the central role. Despite being sidelined on two occasions, due to suspensions, Whitehead played in 23 matches in 2000–01 season, as Oxford suffered relegation to the Third Division. At the end of the 2000–01 season, he signed a long–term contract with the club.

In the 2001–02 season, Whitehead scored his first goal in the Football League against Rushden &amp; Diamonds on 31 August 2001. He was soon a first-team regular in 2001–02 season, establishing himself in the midfield position. However, halfway through the season, Whitehead, along with Chris Hackett were subjected to criticism by manager Ian Atkins for unprofessionalism over refusing to do the club&#x27;s fitness programme, which were denied by the pair, who stated the whole thing was a misunderstanding. Towards the end of the 2001–02 season, he began playing in a central midfield role. Despite missing out three matches, he played in 43 fixtures as Oxford United had a poor season, finishing in 21st position.

Whitehead began the 2002–03 season as a first-team regular in good form. At the beginning of November, Whitehead&#x27;s performances against Aston Villa and Rochdale were praised by Atkins. He continued with his impressive displays to the end of the year. Whitehead later scored his first goal of the season on 26 December, in a 3–0 win over AFC Bournemouth. However, he found his first-team chances limited between January and March. As a result, he was restricted to 22 appearances in 2002–03 as Oxford missed out on a play-off place by a single point.

In 2003–04 season, Whitehead reclaimed his place in the team following the departure of Dave Savage. It wasn&#x27;t until on 27 September 2003 when he scored his first goal of the season, in a 3–0 win over Northampton Town. He was praised for his performances in his run of first-team football. Whitehead scored his first brace of the season on 18 October, in a 4–0 win over Bury. He also scored a free kick on 1 November, helping his team to make a 3–1 comeback win over Darlington. As a result, he was offered a two–year contract by the club, which would keep him at the Kassam Stadium until 2006. On 21 February 2004, he scored against Bury for the second time that season, in a 1–1 draw. In a 2–1 loss against Macclesfield Town on 1 May, Whitehead captained the side for the first time, in the absence of Andy Crosby. By the end of the 2003–04 season, he made 47 appearances and scoring seven goals. Whitehead was named the club&#x27;s Player of the Season.

After playing for the club for five seasons, his contract expired and he turned down the offer of a new one from the club. Manager Graham Rix revealed that Whitehead would have been appointed as Crosby&#x27;s successor as captain if he signed a new contract with the club.

===Sunderland===
In June 2004, Whitehead signed for Championship club Sunderland on a free transfer. Upon signing a three–year contract with the club, he revealed that his ambition and desire to play at a higher level was why he joined Sunderland. Sunderland were ordered to pay £150,000 to Oxford at an FA tribunal, to compensate for the time and money put into his development. Oxford would also receive 25% of any fee should Sunderland sell Whitehead.

Whitehead made his Sunderland debut, coming on as a late substitute for Ben Clark, in a 2–0 loss against Coventry City in the opening game of the season. He quickly became a key member of the team, playing regularly despite facing competition from other midfielders. His run in the first-team saw him praised by manager Mick McCarthy. It wasn&#x27;t until 25 October when he scored his first goal for the club, in a 1–0 win over Rotherham United. He then scored his second goal of the season on 11 December, in a 2–0 win over Cardiff City. Whitehead scored three more goals later in the season in games that ended up as Sunderland victories. Following his good performance at Sunderland halfway through the season, he was given a new three-year contract during 2004–05. Despite missing out three matches during the season, as he went on to make forty–three appearances and scoring five times in all competitions. He helped Sunderland to win the Championship in 2004–05, and was chosen as Players&#x27; Player of the Year by his teammates at the end of the season.

In the 2005–06, Whitehead continued to establish himself in the starting eleven, with the club playing in the Premier League. Despite the club&#x27;s struggles in the Premier League at the start of the season, he made a positive impact for the side. His performances earned him comparison to Manchester United&#x27;s Roy Keane. It wasn&#x27;t until 29 October when he scored his first Premier League goal, in a 4–1 loss against Portsmouth. Three weeks later, on 19 November, Whitehead scored his second goal of the season, in a 3–1 loss against Aston Villa. By November, he began playing in the right-wing position, a more unfamiliar role. On 26 November, Whitehead signed a contract extension with the club, keeping him at the Stadium of Light until 2010. He scored a swerving free kick past then-England goalkeeper Paul Robinson in a 3–2 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 3 December. Sunderland were eventually relegated to the Championship for the 2006–07 season. Despite missing out one match during the 2005–06 season, Whitehead went on to make thirty–eight appearances and scored three goals in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2006–07 season, Reading had a bid of £1.2 million for Whitehead rejected in July 2006. The following month, Whitehead and teammate Liam Lawrence both signed new contracts. He continued to establish himself in the first-team, under the management of newly appointed manager Roy Keane. Whitehead then scored his first goal of the season against West Bromwich Albion, in a 2–0 win during which he was named as man of the match. Then, on 21 October, he scored his second goal of the season, in a 2–0 win against Barnsley. During the 2006–07 season, Whitehead resigned the captaincy to concentrate on his football but he deputised for the frequently injured Steven Caldwell and was reappointed as captain on a permanent basis after Caldwell was sold to Burnley. At one point during the 2006–07 season, Whitehead played in a right–back position following the absence of Nyron Nosworthy. The following month, he reverted to his central midfield position. Towards the end of the season, Whitehead scored two more goals. Sunderland finished first in the Championship in 2006–07, thus making an instant return to the Premier League. At the end of the 2006–07 season, Whitehead was included in the PFA Team of the Year. He also came second in the club&#x27;s Player of the Year vote. Despite being sidelined during the 2006–07 season, Whitehead went on to make forty–seven appearances and scoring four times in all competitions.

In the 2007–08 season, Whitehead played in the right–back position against Tottenham Hotspur in the opening game of the season before sustaining a cruciate knee ligament injury in a match against Wigan Athletic in August, which ruled him out for six months. He made his comeback from injury in early–November 2007 and made his first-team return on 24 November, playing every minute of a 7–1 loss against Everton. Since returning from injury, he regained his first-team place for Sunderland. He then scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–1 loss against Manchester City on 14 April. At the end of the 2007–08 season, Whitehead helped Sunderland to avoid relegation by three points. Despite being sidelined during the season, Whitehead went on to make twenty–eight appearances and scoring once in all competitions. During parts of the season, Whitehead played at right-back, although this ended when Whitehead moved back into central midfield.

Ahead of the 2008–09 season, Whitehead was linked to a move away from Sunderland, as newly-promotion Premier League side Stoke City made a £3 million bid on him. In response, he stated that he wanted to stay at Sunderland. At the start of the season, Whitehead continued to remain in the starting line-up for the side. After a 4–1 loss against Bolton Wanderers on 29 November, he was heavily booed by the club&#x27;s supporters for the performance throughout the match, in what transpired to be Keane&#x27;s last match as Sunderland manager. Whitehead continued to be linked away from Sunderland throughout the January transfer window. Despite missing out four matches during the season, Whitehead helped the side avoid relegation once again after losing 3–2 to Chelsea in the last game of the season as defeats for Newcastle and Middlesbrough meant Sunderland were safe. By the end of the 2008–09 season, Whitehead went on to make thirty–eight appearances in all competitions. He left Sunderland in August 2009 after making 200 appearances for the club.

===Stoke City===
Whitehead signed a four-year contract with Premier League club Stoke City on 24 July 2009 for an initial £3 million fee, rising to £5 million with add-ons. He stated that Stoke&#x27;s team spirit was the main reason for his move to the club. He made his debut on 15 August 2009 in a 2–0 win over Burnley. Whitehead made a slow start to his Stoke career with a number of anonymous performances. However, following a 0–0 draw with Blackburn Rovers, he earned praise from manager Tony Pulis. Whitehead scored his first goal for Stoke when he converted winger Matthew Etherington&#x27;s cross in the 86th-minute in a 3–1 FA Cup fourth-round win over Arsenal at the Britannia Stadium on 24 January 2010. Whitehead was sent off against Tottenham Hotspur in March 2010 in a decision which drew referee Mike Dean heavy criticism from Tony Pulis and Matthew Etherington.

His first Premier League goal for Stoke came against Birmingham City on 9 November 2010, with Whitehead scoring the winning goal in a 3–2 victory. He scored his second league goal for Stoke away to Manchester United on 4 January 2011, becoming the first Stoke player to score at Old Trafford since 1980. Towards the end of 2010–11, Whitehead lost his place in the starting eleven to a resurging Glenn Whelan, making some cameo appearances from the bench. One of these came at Wembley Stadium in the 2011 FA Cup final defeat to Manchester City.

Ahead of the 2011–12 season, Whitehead said he expected to face new competition in the club&#x27;s midfield section. He then made his 100th appearance for Stoke on 3 November 2011 in a UEFA Europa League match against Maccabi Tel Aviv, scoring the first goal in a 2–1 victory. He played in 10 of Stoke&#x27;s 12 European fixtures in 2011–12, and ended the season having played in 47 matches in total. He made a bad start to 2012–13, as on the opening day of the season away to Reading, he conceded a 90th-minute penalty. He was sent off after picking up a second yellow card. He remained back-up to Glenn Whelan for the remainder of the season, being used mainly as a substitute, although he was assigned as a stand-in right-back in the absence of Andy Wilkinson and Ryan Shotton. He was released by Stoke at the end of 2012–13.

===Middlesbrough===
Whitehead signed a two-year contract with Championship club Middlesbrough on 2 July 2013. Manager Tony Mowbray revealed that Whitehead&#x27;s experience of gaining promotion from the Championship twice was the key reason in signing him. Upon joining the club, he was given a number eighteen shirt ahead of a new season. He made his Middlesbrough debut in a 2–1 loss against Leicester City in the opening game of the season. Since joining the club, he quickly established himself in the starting eleven in the midfield position. Despite being in the first-team, Whitehead faced strong competition from other midfielders at the Riverside Stadium. After missing four matches between late–October and late–November, he returned as a late substitute on 30 November 2013, in a 1–0 win over Bolton Wanderers. Whitehead scored his first and what turned out to be only goal for the club in a 2–1 loss away to Derby County on 4 December. Two weeks later, on 21 December, he captained Middlesbrough for the first time, in a 2–0 win over Millwall. Later in the 2013–14 season, Whitehead was suspended on three occasions, including being sent–off for dissent, in a 1–0 loss against Sheffield Wednesday on 1 March. Despite this, he remained in the first-team, where he captained the side four more times later in the season. Whitehead played 38 times and scored one goal in the 2013–14 season, as Middlesbrough finished in 12th-position.

In the 2014–15 season, Whitehead continued to feature in the first team at the start of the season, mostly coming on as a substitute. This was due to added competition for the defensive midfield position with Richard Smallwood, Grant Leadbitter and Adam Clayton. However, in a 4–0 win over Brentford on 20 September, he was sent–off &quot;for an over the top tackle&quot;, leading the referee giving him a straight red card. After serving a three-match suspension, he returned to the first-team from suspension, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2–0 win over Fulham on 2 October. Whitehead captained the side for the first time in the league, in a 1–1 draw against Watford on 25 October. However, throughout the 2014–15 season, Whitehead was demoted to the substitute bench. But he did provide cover, playing twice at right–back and six times in central midfield. He also captained the side once again this season against Sheffield Wednesday on 28 February, which ended in a 2–0 defeat. In the Championship play-offs, Whitehead was featured three times as a right–back, including the play-off final at Wembley, where they lost 2–0 to Norwich City. Whitehead made twenty–five appearances in all competitions. At the end of the season, Whitehead left Middlesbrough as manager Aitor Karanka could not guarantee him game time.

===Huddersfield Town===
In June 2015, Whitehead signed for Championship club Huddersfield Town on a two-year contract. Upon joining the club, he was given a number four shirt ahead of the 2015–16 season. He made his debut in a 2–0 defeat against Hull City at the KC Stadium on 8 August. He captained Huddersfield Town for the first time on 11 August, in a 2–1 loss against Notts County. Whitehead quickly established himself in the first-team under the management of Chris Powell. He captained the side once again following Mark Hudson&#x27;s absence for five matches between 12 September and 3 October. Whitehead&#x27;s performance saw him earned BWF Player of the Month for October and November. However, he suffered a knee injury during a 2–0 win over Birmingham City on 5 December and was sidelined for two months. A month later, on 23 January, Whitehead returned to the first-team from injury, coming on as a late substitute in a 2–1 loss against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Since returning to the first-team, he regained his first-team place in the starting eleven for the rest of the season. By the end of the 2015–16 season, Whitehead went on to make thirty–six appearances in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2016–17 season, Whitehead turned down a move to Rotherham United and said he would fight for his place in the first-team. He missed the first two matches of the new season after being suspended over his involvement in an incident against Brentford in the last game of the previous season. He made his first appearance of the season on 20 August, where he started the whole game of a 2–1 win over Barnsley. However, Whitehead struggled in the first-team under David Wagner, due to strong competition from other midfielders. He captained the side for the first time this season, in a 2–1 win over Rotherham United on 27 September. Due to Hudson&#x27;s absence, Whitehead often stood in as captain, though Tommy Smith was another stand-in captain when Whitehead was not included in the starting eleven. Throughout the January transfer window, he stayed at the Kirklees Stadium after being linked with a move to Wigan Athletic. However, in a 1–0 loss against Burton Albion on 1 April, he was sent–off for a second bookable offence. Whitehead later featured three times as an unused substitute in the Championship play–offs, as he was part of the squad that saw Huddersfield side promoted to the Premier League after beating Reading 5–4 in penalty shoot–out after a 0–0 draw in the EFL Championship play-off final. By the end of the 2016–17 season, he went on to make twenty appearances in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2017–18 season, Huddersfield announced that Whitehead had extended his contract with the club until the end of the 2017–18 Premier League season, with manager David Wagner stating: &quot;Even if he plays less for us, he is still a very important part of the team and our dressing room.&quot; He was included for the 25-man squad for the Premier League. He made his first appearance of the 2017–18 season, where he started the whole game, in a 2–1 win over Rotherham United in the second round of the League Cup on 23 August. Then, on 30 September, Whitehead made his first Premier League appearance – his first in four years – as a late substitute, in a 4–0 loss against Tottenham Hotspur. However, his first-team appearances at Huddersfield Town continued to be restricted to the substitute bench for most of the 2017–18 season. On 11 May 2018, Whitehead announced his retirement from professional football at the end of the 2017–18 season. He made his last appearance for the club (and his football career), coming on as a late substitute, in a 1–0 loss against Arsenal in the last game of the season.

==Coaching career==
Following his retirement, Whitehead took up a coaching role at Huddersfield Town as part of David Wagner&#x27;s first-team technical staff, having earned a UEFA A coaching license, and took charge of the club&#x27;s new Under-17 Academy age group from 1 January 2019. By October, he took charge for Huddersfield Town&#x27;s Under-17s side.

On 16 November 2019, Whitehead joined Sam Ricketts&#x27; backroom staff at League One side Shrewsbury Town, replacing Joe Parkinson as first-team coach. On 25 August 2020, Whitehead was promoted to assistant manager after the departure of Jon Pitts and Graham Barrow. On 25 November, Whitehead and Ricketts were relieved of their duties with the club sitting 23rd in League One with just 9 points from a possible 39.

Whitehead joined the coaching staff at League Two side Port Vale in July 2021 as part of director of football David Flitcroft&#x27;s summer overhaul; manager Darrell Clarke said that Whitehead &quot;is definitely someone our squad can look up to&quot;. Having helped Vale to win promotion at the end of the 2021–22 season, he moved to Turkey in July 2022 to coach alongside Adam Murray at Süper Lig champions Beşiktaş. He left the club when head coach Valérien Ismaël was sacked three months later. He joined Cardiff City as a first-team coach in November 2022. Following the sacking of Mark Hudson on 14 January 2023, Whitehead was placed in interim charge of the first-team at Cardiff City. In the 2023 pre-season, Ismaël was appointed manager at Championship side Watford, and Whitehead moved to work there with him as assistant head coach. He joined Barnsley as a first-team coach in July 2024, working again with Darrell Clarke. He returned to Stoke City in September 2024 to link back up with Narcís Pèlach. He left his position at Stoke in January 2025. He joined Blackburn Rovers as an assistant head coach the following month after Ismaël was appointed as manager.

==Personal life==
Growing up, Whitehead was raised in a football-loving family and supported Liverpool. He has a brother, Craig. During his time at Huddersfield Town, he was known as &#x27;Whitesey&#x27; by his teammate Tommy Smith, who gave him a nickname.

He is good friends with Liam Lawrence, having been Sunderland and Stoke City teammates. During his time at Stoke City and Huddersfield Town, Whitehead resided in Cheshire with his wife, Louise, and their two sons, Olly and Harry.

<text>Daniel Lewis Collins (born 6 August 1980) is a former professional footballer who played as a centre back.

Collins started his career in the Welsh leagues with Mold Alexandra and Buckley Town before joining Chester City in 1996. His first two seasons at Chester saw him make 20 appearances; during the 2002–03 season he went on loan to non-league side Vauxhall Motors. Following his return to Chester, Collins became a regular in the side and produced some fine performances which attracted the attention of Sunderland who bought him for £140,000. Collins spent five years in the North East making over 150 appearances and earning two promotions to the Premier League during that time. In August 2009 Collins joined Stoke City for £2.75 million and played at left back for the &quot;Potters&quot;. After losing his place in the squad he joined Ipswich Town on loan in September 2011 and then West Ham United in March 2012. He signed for Nottingham Forest in July 2012 before having a short stint with Rotherham United from 2015 to 2016. His final club were Grimsby Town where he spent three seasons and became club captain rounding of his spell with the club by making 106 league appearances. He announced his retirement in December 2019 having been released by Grimsby the previous summer.

He has also been capped for England C on six occasions before being called up to the Welsh national side.

==Club career==

===Early career===
He began his career in the Cymru Alliance with local sides Mold Alexandra and Buckley Town. After having trials with Wrexham and Tranmere Rovers, he signed for Chester City in December 2001, who were playing in the Conference. Before turning professional, Collins played cricket for Wales Minor Counties during the football close season. In the 1999 season, he played two matches, taking two wickets at an average of 37.50 and scoring 14 runs at an average of 7.00.

===Chester City===
Collins made his debut for Chester in a 3–1 defeat against Northwich Victoria on boxing day 2001. In just under three years he made over 70 appearances for Chester. It was after a successful spell on loan at Vauxhall Motors that his career started to take off, having been converted from an unconvincing forward into a composed central defender. His time at Vauxhalls included helping them surprisingly knock Queens Park Rangers out of the FA Cup in November 2002. The following season saw Collins miss just one game as Chester won the Football Conference title and returned to the Football League after a four-year absence. Although Chester had a mixed start to the 2004–05 season, Collins continued to impress and a stoppage time goal against Macclesfield Town gave Chester their first win of the season on 4 September 2004.

===Sunderland===

A month later he joined Sunderland for £140,000 amid interest from other clubs including Sheffield United whose manager Neil Warnock hit out at the way Chester handled his transfer to Sunderland. He ended the 2004–05 season with another championship medal and full Welsh caps to his name, he was initially used as a backup player to defenders Gary Breen, Steven Caldwell and George McCartney, in his first season at the club, but still managed to make 14 appearances. Following promotion to the Premier League for the 2005–06 season, Sunderland signed several additional players and Collins found himself out of the first team squad early in the season. He later worked his way into the side but Sunderland endured a nightmare campaign and were comfortably relegated amassing just 15 points.

Collins started the 2006–07 season as first choice defender at Sunderland, but was dropped four games into the season after being booed by a section of the crowd following a mistake in the previous game against Plymouth Argyle. Collins later regained his place following the arrival of manager Roy Keane and won another championship medal come the end of the season. On 15 December Collins scored a late last minute goal against Aston Villa which would have led to the Black Cats victory but referee Steve Bennett denied the goal for a foul on Scott Carson, the foul was not apparent and the goal should have stood. Manager Roy Keane was very angry at the decision and said that Bennett had cheated Sunderland and went as far as to say &quot;the players deserve better.&quot;

On 5 April 2008, Collins scored Sunderland&#x27;s first goal in their 3–1 over Fulham at Craven Cottage despite again having a goal disallowed earlier in the game. He went on to firmly establish himself as a first team regular at Sunderland, starting 32 games in the 2007–08 season. On 30 January 2009, Collins was rewarded with a new two-and-a-half-year contract by Sunderland, keeping him at the club until at least the end of the 2010–11 season. He won the Fans&#x27; Player of the Year award in 2008 and 2009.

===Stoke City===
On 29 August it was reported that Sunderland had accepted a bid from Stoke City for Collins (despite this, he was an unused substitute when the two sides played each other the next day) As expected, he signed for Stoke on 1 September for £2.75 million rising to £3.5 million. Collins made his Stoke debut in a 2–1 defeat at home to Chelsea in the following match against Bolton Wanderers Stoke were leading up until the 88th minute when Collins fouled Sam Ricketts in the penalty area costing Stoke three points. Collins struggled to establish himself at left back during the 2009–10 season often rotating with Danny Higginbotham.

Collins begun the 2010–11 season in good form and has stated that he needs to keep performing well if he is to hold his left back position.&quot;There is a lot of competition here now in every area on the pitch, so the lads who are playing at the moment, like myself, know we have to keep performing. If we don&#x27;t then there are options there for the manager to change things&quot; However, he again struggled and was dropped back to the bench with Higginbotham and Marc Wilson being preferred at left back.
Collins was left out Stoke&#x27;s 25-man Premier League squad by manager Tony Pulis for the 2011–12 season. Collins joined Ipswich Town on a three-month loan deal from Stoke City on 9 September 2011. He played in 16 Championship matches for Ipswich scoring three goals before returning to Stoke. Collins stated that he expected to leave Stoke in the 2012 January transfer window. He did not secure a transfer away from Stoke and made a rare appearance in the fifth round of the FA Cup away at Crawley Town. He also played against Valencia in the UEFA Europa League at the Estadio Mestalla.

On 9 March 2012, Collins joined West Ham United on loan until the end of the 2011–12 season. He made his debut on 10 March in a 1–1 home draw against Doncaster Rovers coming on as an 80th minute substitute for Kevin Nolan. On 17 March Collins scored on his full debut for the &quot;Hammers&quot; in a 1–1 draw against Leeds United.

===Nottingham Forest===
Collins joined Football League Championship side Nottingham Forest on 25 July 2012 for an undisclosed fee. He was appointed club captain by manager Sean O&#x27;Driscoll. He made his debut for Forest in a 1–0 win against Fleetwood Town in the League Cup on 13 August 2012. Collins played 43 times for Forest during the 2012–13 season which saw them miss out on the play-offs on the final day of the season as they lost 3–2 to rivals Leicester City. The following season, he was succeeded as captain by Chris Cohen.

===Rotherham United===
On 3 July 2015 Collins joined Rotherham United on a free transfer. He scored his first goal for Rotherham in the second game of the season, scoring the opening goal in a 2–1 defeat to former club Nottingham Forest.

===Grimsby Town===
Having been a free agent for over a month, Collins was snapped up by League Two side Grimsby Town on 12 September 2016 on a 6-month contract. He made his full debut with Grimsby on 24 September 2016, in their 1–0 win at Mansfield Town. He scored his first goal for the club on 19 November 2016 from a corner, he placed a header from close range to take the lead in their 3–0 victory at Plymouth Argyle. Having been ever-present under Paul Hurst and new manager Marcus Bignot, Collins agreed to extend his contract until the end of the season.

Collins agreed to a new one-year deal on 2 June 2017 with the club. He was offered a new contract by Grimsby at the end of the 2017–18 season.

Collins suffered a broken arm in the 3rd league game of the 2018–19 season, scans revealed he had fractured his right ulna, he underwent surgery the following Sunday. He sustained the injury after falling awkwardly winning a header in the 3rd minute against Shay McCartan, even though injured he went on to complete the full 90 minutes in a 1–1 home draw against Lincoln City on 18 August 2018.

Collins suffered a thigh strain injury on 20 December 2018 in a 2–1 win over Swindon Town, meaning he would be out until at least January 2019.

He was released by Grimsby at the end of the 2018–19 season. Collins announced his retirement from professional football in December 2019.

==International career==
Despite being born in England, Collins has represented Wales at international level. He made his debut on 9 February 2005 during a 2–0 win over Hungary in the first match of John Toshack&#x27;s second spell as Wales&#x27; manager. His last cap came on 22 August 2007 during a 1–0 friendly win over Bulgaria. Two months after the match, Collins withdrew from the Wales squad to face Germany and Slovakia in the qualifying round of UEFA Euro 2008. Having previously fallen out with Toshack over being left on the bench during a friendly match with Paraguay in March 2006,

Following the resignation of Toshack and the appointment of Brian Flynn as Wales caretaker manager, Collins, who had not been called up since 2007, was selected in the Wales squad for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches in October 2010. His first call-up as a Forest player was in the squad to face Belgium and Serbia in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. However, Collins turned the call-up down and said, &quot;Playing for Wales has always meant a great deal, it&#x27;s a massive honour to play for your country, but at my age I feel I would be better served to stay with Forest to train and prepare for the demanding fixtures in the Championship. I&#x27;m grateful to Chris [Coleman] for considering me but I feel it&#x27;s important I focus on Forest now.&quot;

==Personal life==
Collins now works for Sunderland as a matchday commentator and club podcaster, alongside Frankie Francis, after relocating back to the north east with his family after retiring from playing.

<text>Sadko ( , the name of the main character) is an 1898 opera in seven scenes by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The libretto was written by the composer, with assistance from Vladimir Belsky, Vladimir Stasov, and others. Rimsky-Korsakov was first inspired by the bylina of Sadko in 1867, when he completed a tone poem on the subject, his Op. 5. After finishing his second revision of this work in 1891, he decided to turn it into a dramatic work.

The music is highly evocative, and Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s famed powers of orchestration are abundantly evident throughout the score. According to the Soviet critic Boris Asafyev, writing in 1922, &quot;Sadko&quot; constitutes the summit of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s craft. From the opus 5 tone poem the composer quoted its most memorable passages, including the opening theme of the swelling sea, and other themes as leitmotives – he himself set out to &quot;utilize for this opera the material of my symphonic poem, and, in any event, to make use of its motives as leading motives for the opera&quot;.

==Performance history==
The composer was closely involved in the &quot;assiduous&quot; rehearsals, and he &quot;drilled the orchestra with great care, together with [the conductor] Esposito who proved a very fair musician&quot;. Rimsky also corrected errors in the score and worked hard with the chorus. Apart from the Sea Tsar singer &quot;whom I could not endure&quot; he approved of all the solo singers and singled out Zabyela, who &quot;sang magnificently&quot; and Syekar-Rozhanski.

The world premiere took place on 7 January 1898 (O.S. 26 December 1897), presented by the Russian Private Opera at the Solodovnikov Theatre in Moscow. Its conductor was Eugenio Esposito, the brother of Michele Esposito, with scenic designers Konstantin Korovin and Sergey Malyutin. The production was financed by the railway tycoon Savva Mamontov; this was the first time that one of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s operas was staged by a commercial theatre rather than the Imperial Theatres. The St. Petersburg premiere followed 26 January 1901 at the Mariinsky Theatre, conducted by Eduard Nápravník, with scenic design by Apollinary Vasnetsov.

In 1906, the opera was presented at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow conducted by Vyacheslav Suk, with scenic design by Konstantin Korovin. The first US performance occurred at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 25 January 1930 in French with Tullio Serafin, followed a year later by the first performance in London in June 1931.

A truncated production was mounted in Monte Carlo in 1921, conducted by Victor de Sabata, with Dimitri Smirnov in the title role. Revivals took place at the Bolshoi in 1935, 1949 and 1963. A production at the Berlin Staatsoper in 1947 featured Ludwig Suthaus, Erna Berger and Margarete Klose. Aleksandr Ptushko directed a film of the opera in 1952 with the music but without singing. A new production by Alexei Stepaniuk for the Mariinsky Theatre in 1993 was later toured to Paris (Théâtre des Champs-Élysées) and recorded.

&quot;Sadko&quot; is rarely performed today outside the Russian Federation. However, there have been recent performances by Opera Vlaanderen and in Bratislava.

== Roles ==
==Synopsis==
(Note: Instead of traditional acts, &quot;Sadko&quot; is divided in seven scenes, and, as that type of structure would suggest, is more loosely constructed than a traditional opera. The opera is usually performed in three or five acts, depending on how the scenes are grouped: Three acts – 1–2, 3–4, 5–6–7 or 1–2–3, 4, 5–6–7: Five acts – 1, 2–3, 4, 5–6, 7)

:Time: The historical figure Sadko lived in the 12th century.
:Place: The action takes place in Novgorod and in the legendary realm of the Sea Tsar.

The opera tells the story of Sadko, a gusli player (&quot;guslar&quot;), who leaves his wife, Lubava, and home in Novgorod and eventually returns a wealthy man. During his years of travel he amasses a fortune, weds the daughter of the Tsar and Tsarina of the Ocean and has other adventures. Upon his return, the city and Lubava rejoice.

&quot;Scene 1 – The rich mansion of a guild in Novgorod&quot;

The wealthy Novgorod merchants congratulate themselves on their prosperity. Nezhata, a gusli player from Kiev, sings an heroic song. In reply, Sadko also sings, but the merchants laugh at him when he suggests that Novgorod would be more prosperous if a river joined Lake Ilmen to the ocean.

&quot;Scene 2 – The shores of Lake Ilmen&quot;

Sadko wanders unhappily by the lakeside. His singing attracts some swans, one of which changes into Volkhova, the Sea Princess, who wishes to marry a mortal. She explains to Sadko how to catch three golden fish which will lead to his fortune after a long voyage. The Princess promises to him to wait patiently for his return. At dawn, from the lake the voice of the Sea-Tsar is heard. He calls his daughters home into the depths. The girls once again turn into white swans and swim away into the distance.

&quot;Scene 3 – An attic in Sadko&#x27;s home (in Novgorod)&quot;

Sadko&#x27;s wife, Lubava, is missing her husband. She is happy when he comes home at last, but distressed when he announces his intention to leave immediately in order to seek his fortune.

&quot;Scene 4 – A pier in Novgorod (on the banks of Lake Ilmen)&quot;

Merchants assemble at the quayside and Nezhata sings another gusli song. The merchants deride Sadko when he explains how he will win his fortune by catching three golden fish. Sadko bets them that he can do this, and, after he is successful in catching the fish, he wins their ships to take on his voyage. He sets about gathering a crew for his voyage. Three visiting merchants, a Viking, an Indian and a Venetian, sing in turn of their homelands (Song of India). Sadko decides to set sail for Venice.

&quot;Scene 5 – A peaceful expanse of the ocean&quot;

Sadko&#x27;s fleet of ships is returning home, laden with treasure, but becomes becalmed. Sadko&#x27;s crew throw treasure over the side to propitiate the Sea-Tsar, but no wind appears. Sadko is left behind, clinging to a log, when the wind suddenly picks up while he is overboard.

&quot;Scene 6 – In the depths of the sea&quot;

The scene shifts to the realm of the sea-Tsar, where Sadko sings to the Tsar and tsarina , winning the hand of their daughter, Volkhova. The wedding celebrations become so boisterous that a storm springs up, sinking ships on the surface of the sea, and the realm of the Sea-Tsar is destroyed. The end of the reign of the pagan tsar is heralded by an apparition of a Christian pilgrim (actually St Nicholas of Mozhaysk). Sadko and Volkhova escape the destruction on a sea-shell.

&quot;Scene 7 – Novogrod, a green meadow on the shores of Lake Ilmen&quot;

Sadko is asleep by the lakeside. Volkhova watches over him and sings a lullaby. Before he wakes, she bids him farewell and then disappears, becoming changed into the River Volkhova that now links Lake Ilmen with the sea. Lubava finds her husband asleep and wakes him: he believes that his voyage was nothing but a dream, but the sight of the new river and his fleet of ships convinces him that he really is now a very wealthy man.

==Related works==
*Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s earlier symphonic poem &quot;Sadko&quot;, Op. 5 (1867), may be regarded as a precursor to the opera, as it is based on the same story and the opera incorporates several musical ideas from the orchestral work. There are three versions:
#&quot;Episode from the Bïlina of Sadko&quot; (1867)
#&quot;Musical Tableau–Sadko&quot; (1869)
#&quot;Musical Tableau–Sadko&quot; (1892)

==Adaptations==
In 1922 the English composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji wrote a pastiche on the &quot;Hindu Merchant&#x27;s Song&quot; as the third of his &quot;Three Pastiches for Piano&quot;. In 1953, a Russian film directed by Aleksandr Ptushko entitled &quot;Sadko&quot; based on the opera and featuring Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s music was released. 
The 1953 Soviet biopic &quot;Rimsky-Korsakov&quot; features pieces of the opera.
Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s 1938 instrumental arrangement of the &quot;Song of the Indian Guest&quot; is a jazz classic, compiled on &quot;This Is Tommy Dorsey &amp; His Orchestra, Vol. 1&quot;.

<text>gFTP is a free and open-source multithreaded File Transfer Protocol client program. It is most used on Unix-like systems such as Linux, . It includes both a graphical user interface (GUI), which utilizes the GTK+ graphical toolkit, and a command-line interface. gFTP is released under the terms of the GPL and has been translated into 45 languages.

There is support for the FTP, FTPS (control connection only), HTTP, HTTPS, SFTP, and FSP protocols as well as FTP and HTTP proxy server support and FXP file transfers (transferring files between two remote servers via FTP).

The GUI uses a double-paned layout, with the local filesystem in the left pane and the remote filesystem in the right pane. Below there is a transfer queue that shows the real-time status of each queued or active file transfer. At the bottom is a message log, which displays the text commands and responses between gFTP and the remote server. Sites are stored in a hierarchical collection of bookmarks, though a site bar allows connections to unbookmarked sites.

Project head Brian Masney indicated in June 2013 that, with no new releases since 2008, he would like a new developer to take it over. To date no one has done so and the project remains dormant.

<text>Mark John Lynch (born 2 September 1981) is an English former professional footballer who played as a right-back. He began his career with Manchester United and spent most of the 2001–02 season on loan with Scottish club St Johnstone, but failed to break into the Manchester United first team on a regular basis. He went on to play for Sunderland, Hull City, Yeovil Town, Rotherham United, Stockport County and Altrincham before retiring from professional football in 2012.

==Career==
Born in Manchester, Lynch began his career with Manchester United. To gain first-team experience, he joined Scottish Premier League side St Johnstone on loan in October 2001 and made 20 appearances for the club. He made one senior appearance for Manchester United, against Deportivo de La Coruña in the UEFA Champions League in March 2003, in which he scored an own goal. In July 2004, Lynch moved to Sunderland on a free transfer. He made 11 appearances during the 2004–05 season and was allowed to leave in June 2005.

On 14 June 2005, Lynch signed for Championship club Hull City on a free transfer. He suffered a knee injury in the first minute of his Hull City debut in August 2005 against Queens Park Rangers, and in his first game back against Coventry City he was sent off. He made 15 further appearances for Hull in the 2005–06 season, the last of which was in January, and at the end of the season he was made available for transfer by manager Peter Taylor.

In August 2006, Lynch moved to Yeovil Town on loan but then signed on a permanent deal before the transfer deadline. He was released in May 2008.

Lynch signed a two-year deal Rotherham United on 27 May 2008. He made his Rotherham United debut against Lincoln City, and scored twice on his third appearance for the club against Morecambe.

On 14 July 2010, he signed for Stockport County, but was released on 31 January 2012. He subsequently joined Altrincham, but was released by the club at the end of the season after making seven first-team appearances.

<text>The National Assembly is bicameral with the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, having 40 members elected in single-seat constituencies for a four-year term. The upper house, the Shura Council, has 40 members appointed by the King of Bahrain, with the stated aim of giving a voice to minority communities and technocratic experts within the legislative process. Supporters of the system refer to long established democracies the United Kingdom and Canada operating with this bicameralism with an appointed upper chamber and an elected lower chamber. Opponents of this system point out that unlike the bicameral systems in the UK and Canada, the Bahraini system gives the unelected upper house equal or more legislative power than the elected lower house, allowing the King to control all legislation. Opponents also point out that the current system was imposed unilaterally by the King, violating the and a 2001 signed agreement with the Bahraini opposition.

Bahrain&#x27;s electoral framework is unfair, with electoral districts deliberately designed to underrepresent Shiites, who form a majority of the citizen population. The government has also allegedly drawn district boundaries to put certain political societies, including leftist and Sunni Islamist groups, at a disadvantage. The government agency responsible for administering elections is not an independent and is headed by the justice minister, a member of the royal family.

==Latest elections==
Nine of the 40 constituencies were decided in the first round, with the other 31 going to a runoff. According to the government, voter turnout in the first round was 67%, an increase from 53% in the 2014 elections. However, the opposition claimed that the real voter turnout did not exceed 28%-30%.

Dersch started development on Panorama Tools in 1998, producing software available for creating panoramas and more, but had to stop development in 2001 due to legal harassment and claims of patent infringement by the company IPIX. Dersch released the core library (pano12) and some of the programs of Panorama Tools under the terms of the GNU General Public License. The rest of the applications were made available as binary executables only and for free without a copyleft license.

The development of the source code of Panorama Tools was continued by some members of the original Panorama Tools mailing list. In December 2003 they initiated a free software project which is currently hosted by SourceForge. SourceForge requires that all hosted software is released under an open source license. For this reason Dersch&#x27;s unlicensed binaries are not hosted there, although they can still be found on mirror websites.

On 5 August 2007, Dersch announced his intention to relicense the Panorama Tools source code. On 9 August 2007, Dersch changed the license to a GNU Lesser General Public License.

==Sub-components==
===Original release===
PanoTools consists of the following components:

;PTEditor: Java interactive panorama editor.
;PTPicker: Java front end to panorama stitcher and other tools. It provides a graphical interface for feature point selection and position optimization.
;PTCrypt: Java tool for scrambling pictures intended to be viewed on-line with PTViewer.
;PTStitcher: Panorama stitching tool which remaps, adjusts and combines arbitrary images to panoramic views.
;PTOptimizer†: Optimizes positions and sizes of images using control-point data.
;PTStereo: Creates 3-dimensional objects from 2 or more stereoscopic images.
;PTInterpolate: Physically valid true view interpolator. Given two images of the same scene taken from different positions, this tool creates views from any intermediate position.
;PTMorpher: Morphing tool.
;PTAverage: Averages images to reduce noise and enhance density.
;PTStripe: Combines images into movie-stripes for viewing in object-viewers (PTMovie extension to PTViewer).
;PanoTools Plugins:Photoshop, GraphicConverter and GIMP plug-ins for image correction and remapping. Also compatible to many other programs that can use Photoshop plug-ins.
;pano12 library†: The underlying panorama library, currently used by several different panorama front-ends and command line programs.
;pano13 library†: Current version of the library. No longer compatible with programs for which no source code is available.

===Further developments===

In 2006 the functionality of PTstitcher was reproduced by the developers of Panorama Tools. Its functionality was broken into several program, in an attempt to modularize it:

;PTmender†: Remaps one image at a time
;PTblender†: Implements the rudimentary colour correction algorithm found in later versions of PTstitcher
;PTmasker†: Computes stitching masks. It implements the ability to increase depth-of-field by stacking images
;PTroller†: Takes a set of images and merges them into a single one
;PTcrop†: Crops an image to its outer rectangle.
;PTuncrop†: Opposite of PTcrop: takes a cropped file and creates an uncropped one.
;PTtiff2psd†: Takes a series of input images and creates a Photoshop PSD file where each input file is a layer.

===Front-ends and applications===
To make working with Panorama Tools easier and to add functionality, many interactive, graphical front-ends to Panorama Tools have been developed, both open source (e.g. Hugin) and commercial (e.g. PTgui and PTMac), along with a variety of other companion applications (e.g. smartblend and ), which in many cases make interacting directly with the programs in the original Panorama Tools toolset unnecessary.

<text>Cursed is a 2005 American horror comedy film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson, who both collaborated on the &quot;Scream&quot; film series. The film stars Christina Ricci and Jesse Eisenberg as two orphaned siblings attacked by a werewolf loose in Los Angeles.

Originally planned for 2003, the film took over two more years to be made than originally planned, during which producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein kept asking for reshoots and changes to the plot, re-edited the movie to give a PG-13 rating rather than the original intended R-rating, and fired veteran makeup artist Rick Baker to replace the werewolves he had created with computer-generated ones, even rumored to at one point to hire Disney animator Eric Goldberg to animate an opening sequence for the film &quot;Cursed&quot; was released theatrically in the United States on February 25, 2005, by Miramax Films. The film was a box-office bomb and received generally negative reviews from critics; Craven himself was very displeased with the final result.

==Plot==
On a seaside pier in Los Angeles, friends Jenny Tate and Becky Morton decide to get their fortune told by Zela. Zela foretells that they will suffer a horrible fate warning about a beast that feeds off the moon. However, they do not believe her. That night, 16-year-old high-schooler Jimmy Myers is picked up on Mulholland Drive by his older sister Ellie, who returns from visiting her boyfriend Jake Taylor. Jimmy had a run-in with some bullies and his crush Brooke.

Driving home, Jimmy and Ellie collide with an animal and another car. They attempt to rescue the other driver, Becky, but a creature attacks the trio, killing Becky and slashing the siblings. When interviewed by police, despite Jimmy&#x27;s belief that it was a wolf or dog-type animal, the official report credits it to a bear or cougar.

The next day at work, Ellie finds herself attracted to the scent of a coworkers blood, but dismisses it. At a party, Jenny interrupts a conversation between Ellie and Jake. Annoyed that Jenny is flirting with Jake, Ellie leaves the party early. Later, while heading to the parking garage, Jenny is chased and killed by a wolf-like creature. Jimmy does research about wolves and starts to believe that the creature was a werewolf, sharing his thoughts with a disbelieving Ellie. To ease Jimmy&#x27;s concerns, she touches a silver picture frame without getting burned.

Jimmy is becoming stronger and more aggressive, as shown when a bully named Bo coerces him to join the wrestling team. He easily defeats three wrestlers, including Bo, and calls Bo out for constantly making gay jokes towards him, saying that Bo himself is repressing his own homosexuality.

Ellie starts to believe the werewolf hypothesis when she meets Zela. Zela warns about the effect the coming full moon will have and says that the only way to cure herself is to end the line of the werewolf who cursed her. Jimmy proves they have been cursed when he holds a silver cake server and gets burned, discovering that the picture frame Ellie touched earlier was actually stainless steel. The siblings&#x27; dog Zipper, who has become afraid of his owners, bites Jimmy, becoming infected with the curse, and goes on a rampage. Realizing what is happening, Jimmy goes to warn Ellie with Bo, who showed up at their house to confess that he is gay and has feelings for Jimmy. Bo is rejected by Jimmy who believes the attraction to be his werewolf pheromones, but Bo still helps Jimmy.

Ellie has deduced that Jake is a werewolf, and he confirms it. However, he reveals that he did not attack her and Jimmy as he was born a werewolf and can control his transformations. When another werewolf attacks the two, Bo and Jimmy try to help, but Bo is knocked out. The werewolf turns back into Joanie, who was cursed after a one-night stand with Jake, and reveals she committed all of the previous murders. She now wants to kill all potential rivals so Jake will be hers.

When Jake offers to let Joanie kill him to protect Ellie, she refuses, knowing that killing him would break her curse. After knocking him out, she turns into a werewolf and goes after Ellie and Jimmy. The siblings fight her, and when the police arrive, the two draw Joanie out by insulting her. The police open fire, eventually killing her when a policeman shoots her in the head. Bo survives, but Jake disappears in the aftermath.

Jimmy and Ellie return to their wrecked home. As Jimmy works to restore the power, the two siblings begin transforming. Jake arrives at the house, revealing that since he was the originator of Joanie&#x27;s curse; the only way to cure Jimmy and Ellie is for them to kill him. However, Jake then reveals his desire be with Ellie, but also must kill Jimmy so only he remains the alpha male. Jake and Ellie fight, and Jake ends up having the upper hand. Jimmy, having transformed into a werewolf, joins in the fight. After climbing across the ceiling and biting Jake; Ellie is able to stab and badly injure Jake with the silver cake server. Ellie decapitates Jake with a shovel and breaks the curse on the two siblings (and Zipper). Jake&#x27;s body bursts into flames.

Bo, Brooke, and Zipper arrive at the house. Jimmy kisses Brooke and walks her home along with Bo; he and Jimmy now friends. Ellie is stuck with the clean-up of their mangled house.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Development===
The first draft of the script was written by Kevin Williamson in August 2000 and followed the exploits of a New York City serial killer who discovers that his lethal tendencies are due to his lycanthrope nature.
Both screenwriters Sean Hood and Tony Gayton did rewrites of Williamson&#x27;s original script during the development process. Director Wes Craven had previous been attached to direct &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;, a werewolf film for Dimension Films in 1997 about a series of murders in a small West Virginia town, but the film was never made.
Dimension Films co-founder Bob Weinstein announced in October 2002 that &quot;Cursed&quot; would &quot;reinvent the werewolf genre,&quot; and that Craven would direct, with the movie being officially released on August 8, 2003. Craven was in the final stages of pre-production with the movie &quot;Pulse&quot; when Weinstein abruptly pulled the movie from the schedule ten days before shooting and cut through all the slow lanes, getting &quot;Cursed&quot; off and running. Craven was reportedly not pleased so Weinstein doubled his pay in order for him to do the werewolf film. The director deemed the script too tonally similar to his film &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot;, but felt pressured by the studio, leading him to ultimately sign on.
&quot;Wes and Kevin are a dynamic team, and we are confident that their collaboration will prove to be a winner,&quot; Weinstein stated.
In December 2002, a press release for the project described &quot;Cursed&quot; as a &quot;modern, hip twist on the classic werewolf tale&quot; and Dimension Films also announced that Academy Award winning makeup effects designer Rick Baker would be in charge of the overall design of the werewolves. Baker had originally turned down the offer due to the very limited time he had to create all the designs and eventually accepted at the only condition to be able to work without any studio interference.

===Casting===

The first of the three leads to be cast was 19-year-old Jesse Eisenberg, star of the critically acclaimed indie &quot;Roger Dodger&quot;, who was announced on March 3, 2003. It was also reported that 
Kristina Anapau and Judy Greer had joined the cast in supporting roles.

On March 13, 2003, it was reported that Christina Ricci had signed on to play the leading role of Ellie Harper, an associate producer on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot; who is attacked by a werewolf after a car accident on Mulholland Drive. The same day, Scott Foley and Omar Epps were also cast as Ellie&#x27;s boyfriend Kyle and the chief of the animal control department Ben Taft, respectively.

On March 17, 2003, Skeet Ulrich (who previously starred in Craven&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot; as Billy Loomis) joined the cast as Vince Winston, the burnout son of a millionaire who gets bitten and cursed by the beast. Other cast members included Milo Ventimiglia (Bo, a high school bully), James Brolin (Tyler Winston, Vince&#x27;s estranged billionaire father), Shannon Elizabeth (Becky Morton, a party girl who gets brutally murdered under the Santa Monica Pier), Illeana Douglas (Zela, an atypical fortune teller) and Robert Forster (Detective Harzel). Scott Baio himself along with Corey Feldman were cast as themselves.
Pop singer and actress Mandy Moore was cast as Jenny Taylor, the opening victim who gets killed by the werewolf during a costume party sponsored by PETA. &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; star Heather Langenkamp joined the cast in a small, supporting role as a TV reporter and John C. McGinley took part in the production as Jimmy&#x27;s abusive dad. James Kallahan and Michelle Krusiec rounded out the main cast as Ellie&#x27;s co-workers Mark and Debbie.

When production shut down and resumed with a new script, new roles were added and others were re-written. Skeet Ulrich was unsatisfied with his character&#x27;s transformation and chose to drop out of the film. 
On December 1, 2003, Joshua Jackson was cast as the new male lead (renamed Jack and retooled as Ellie&#x27;s boyfriend), along with Portia De Rossi (who replaced Illeana Douglas as Zela), &quot;Smallville&quot; regular Michael Rosenbaum (taking over James Callahan as Ellie&#x27;s assistant, now named Kyle) and R&amp;B singer Mýa as Jenny, previously played by Mandy Moore.
Lance Bass of *NSYNC joined the cast in a cameo appearance as himself.
Scott Foley was originally supposed to reprise the role of Kyle (now turned into Ellie&#x27;s assistant) but ultimately dropped out as well.
James Brolin, Robert Forster, Corey Feldman, Omar Epps, Heather Langenkamp and John C. McGinley were all written out from the new version of the script and couldn&#x27;t reprise their roles.

===Filming===
Principal photography was supposed to start on January 27, in order to meet the already-locked August 8, 2003 release date, but delays in pre-production forced Dimension Films to push the start date back to mid March. On late January, a new release date was therefore announced and set on February 4, 2004.
With a budget of $35 million, &quot;Cursed&quot; commenced shooting on March 17, 2003, in Los Angeles, on a scheduled 15-weeks shoot. 
The set used for the high school is Torrance High School, the same used for Sunnydale High on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and West Beverly High on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and its spin-off &quot;90210&quot;. Filming also occurred at Verdugo Hills High School for the scenes involving Jimmy Myers, Jesse Eisenberg&#x27;s character Mandy Moore&#x27;s opening scene was shot over a 2-night period on the roof of The Bel Age Hotel in Hollywood. Singer Sheila E. appeared in this scene as herself, playing with her band at the costume ball for PETA. The car accident was shot on Mulholland Drive and some interiors were built inside the L.A. Center Studios. More scenes were filmed at the Santa Monica Pier and in Hollywood Boulevard.
&quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; did interviews with Ulrich and Ricci when original version was being filmed, and their report included behind the scenes footage of some scenes from it, like Ulrich&#x27;s character Vince walking near the pier at night, another scene in same location showing him jumping down on beach and landing on all fours, scene where he and Ricci&#x27;s character Ellie are running out of her house and another scene after that one where they jump down to the streets which based on the original script, was the beginning of the scene where werewolf chases after them but they get to Vince&#x27;s limousine and ultimately manage to escape.

In early June 2003, after 54 days of filming and with only about six days left to shoot the final confrontation at the Hollywood Wax Museum, Dimension Films decided to put the movie on hold because top executives at the company weren&#x27;t happy with the film&#x27;s ending or how the special effects were progressing, specifically the look of the film&#x27;s lead lupine.

Rick Baker was preparing the final transformation effects when production stopped and asked Weinstein to let his team finish the work in order for it to be ready for the reshoot.
&quot;We were doing some really cool transformation stuff [but] it wasn’t quite done so I said, ‘Listen, if you ever think the film’s gonna pick up again, if you can keep a number of my people on for another month we can have this transformation stuff, wel’ll put it in a box and we’ll be ready to go. If they disperse now it’s gonna be like starting again because I need to have the same people.&quot; Weinstein eventually refused.

Editor Patrick Lussier, a frequent collaborator of Craven, had just finished working on re-shoots of &quot;Darkness Falls&quot; when he was brought in to work on &quot;Cursed&quot;, which was nearing the end of its principal photography. According to Lussier, the unfinished original version of the film ran about 90 minutes long, and the only thing it was missing, besides the ending, was the score and all the visual effects. 
The movie was put back into a development phase during which all parties discussed on the outcome. Several options were considered, including shooting the final confrontation as it was originally written or transform the script into something different, saving as much filmed footage as possible. One alternative was to turn the characters of Jesse Eisenberg and John C. McGinley into werewolf hunters.
Ultimately, the original screenplay went under a major rewrite that turned Ellie and Jimmy into estranged siblings and morphed Vince into Ellie&#x27;s mysterious boyfriend Jake. From those 90 minutes, the new version only included about 12 minutes of the original footage.

After a tentative September restart, the movie officially went back into production on November 17, 2003. &quot;Quite an extraordinary amount of new material is going to be shot, and a lot of material is going to be thrown away,&quot; Craven said at the time. Rick Baker, who had created the original werewolf design, left the project because of scheduling conflicts and KNB EFX Group came on board to oversee all the new makeup effects.
The exteriors for Jake&#x27;s new club Tinsel were shot in Vine Street, next to The Capitol Records Tower, Hollywood and Jimmy and Ellie&#x27;s house was built on the Universal Studios backlot.
In the film, Ellie works among the crew of &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot;, with Kilborn making a cameo appearance and Scott Baio, as himself, being booked to appear on the show. Kilborn left the show a few months after shooting wrapped, in August 2004, before the film&#x27;s release, and was replaced by Craig Ferguson. Originally, During the rewrites, Bob Weinstein wanted the movie to open with an animated opening sequence similar to Scooby-Doo, he wanted to get Disney animator Eric Goldberg to make the sequence, But Goldberg declined twice.

On January 17, 2004, the extensive reshoot wrapped. The new ending of the film was much more emotional and tragic, and featured Jackson&#x27;s character begging his girlfriend Ellie to kill him to end the curse. An article about the film in &quot;Fangoria&quot; #241 included pictures of a head prop for Jake&#x27;s original death scene. From all versions of the film which were test screened to audiences (excluding the original version, which was never test screened), this one scored the highest, but Dimension Films was dissatisfied with it and demanded a new one. Actor Jesse Eisenberg, who, along with Christina Ricci, was one of the few actors to work in all the different versions, stated: “The crazy part is that after we filmed the whole second version of the film, we had to go back for a third re-shoot which lasted about 20 days. That&#x27;s like the length of an independent movie. And then we had to go back a fourth time for like 10 days and they made shirts that said &quot;Cursed 4: Back for More&quot;.&quot;
The new ending depicted Jake as the main villain, willing to kill both Ellie and Jimmy.
According to Patrick Lussier, the final budget for the film was close to $90–100 million. In the final round of reshoots, werewolf actor Derek Mears improvised the infamous shot of the werewolf flipping off Ellie and Jimmy during rehearsal with Craven. Scott Nimerfro was at one point brought in during reshoots to script new scenes, including an opening sequence of the werewolf jumping through the Hollywood sign that was scrapped due to budget limits. In 2014, Judy Greer spoke of the film in an interview: &quot;I don&#x27;t know why that movie got so fucked up. I don&#x27;t understand it. I thought the script was fine. Honest to god, I didn&#x27;t get the big deal. I don&#x27;t know who kept making them fuck with it. Then we shot the movie for, like, seven years. I think they said we had four movies worth of footage. It was so fun, but so weird. I don&#x27;t get it. I couldn&#x27;t figure it out.&quot; In 2018, Christina Ricci also spoke briefly about the film in an interview: &quot;It was one of those studio movies that just got horribly screwed up.&quot; In 2019, Jesse Eisenberg gave his thoughts about the troubled production and the film: &quot;The first movie was more interesting and provocative. I don&#x27;t know why it wasn&#x27;t working. Now that we know the behind-the-scenes of the Weinstein company, it makes sense as to why it was so chaotic.&quot; About the troubled production he said: &quot;They filmed 90% of the bigger budget version… the first movie was this very splashy thing. The second version was definitely cutting corners in a lot of different ways. And the plot? I thought it was so stupid. I thought the plot was so cliché. They made us brother and sister? The things that they kept [from the original film] were little snippets. Like a car rolling down a hill. They kept that shot.&quot;

===Post-production===
Editor Patrick Lussier was supposed to work on the film for only six weeks in summer 2003, but ended up working on it for 19 months. He also worked as a second unit director during the extensive reshoots.
All Rick Baker&#x27;s designs were cut and most of KNB practical effects were replaced by CGI, including Judy Greer&#x27;s transformation. Nevertheless, Rick Baker&#x27;s name was displayed in the opening credits as the sole special makeup effects designer and creator.

In the fall of 2004, Dimension Films cut the film to a PG-13 rating instead of the planned R rating. Speaking to the &quot;New York Post&quot;, Craven commented, &quot;The contract called for us to make an R-rated film. We did. It was a very difficult process. Then it was basically taken away from us and cut to PG-13 and ruined. It was two years of very difficult work and almost 100 days of shooting of various versions. Then at the very end, it was chopped up and the studio thought they could make more with a PG-13 movie, and trashed it ... I thought it was completely disrespectful, and it hurt them too, and it was like they shot themselves in the foot with a shotgun.&quot; Jenny&#x27;s death scene in the elevator was originally much gorier, her dead body shown with her belly ripped apart, although not even the R-rated DVD version included this scene. A picture of her mutilated body was, however, shown in a &quot;Fangoria&quot; article published before the film&#x27;s release covering the infamously troubled production. Craven and Lussier would move on to &quot;Red Eye&quot;, and during that film&#x27;s post-production they would learn that &quot;Cursed&quot; would be edited down to accommodate a PG-13 rating. A nightmare sequence featuring Jake&#x27;s throat getting ripped out by Ellie was redone without Craven, instead with Joel Soisson serving as director. In 2008, Craven was quoted saying, &quot;...the &quot;Cursed&quot; experience was so screwed up. I mean, that went on for two-and-a-half years of my life for a film that wasn&#x27;t anything close to what it should have been. […] I did learn from the &quot;Cursed&quot; experience not to do something for money. They said, &#x27;We know you want to do another film, we&#x27;ll pay you double.&#x27; And we were 10 days from shooting, and I said fine. But I ended up working two-and-a-half years for double my fee, but I could have done two-and-a-half movies, and done movies that were out there making money. In general, I think it&#x27;s not worth it and part of the reason my phone hasn&#x27;t rung is that that story is pretty well known.&quot;

In July 2021, Brian Collins from Screamfest blog did a review and comparison between the final film and both the Craven&#x27;s original unfinished cut and first reshot version, which were surfaced from VHS workprints, and both versions were praised as superior to the final film. This is not the first time when news about alternate versions of &quot;Cursed&quot; existing were reported. Some years ago when he was asked by fans about the film, Patrick Lussier mentioned how he still has copies of three unreleased versions of the film (Craven&#x27;s unfinished cut, first reshot version, and fully uncut reshot version with all the deleted gore and practical effects by KNB from before most of their work was cut as well), and in October 2018, former Dimension COO Cary Blanat confirmed that all original and deleted footage from &quot;Cursed&quot; still exists.

==Release==
=== Theatrical ===
The original target release date was August 8, 2003, but delays in getting the production ready in time pushed the target date back six months to February 13, 2004. When the movie was sent back to development and three different reshoots were scheduled, the release date was pushed back again. In December 2004 &quot;Fangoria&quot; reported that the movie was scheduled to open nationwide February 25, 2005 with a PG-13 rating.

Christina Ricci&#x27;s face served as the backdrop in the movie&#x27;s key art, that evoked Drew Barrymore&#x27;s close-up in &quot;Scream&quot;&#x27;s iconic official poster. The tagline for the movie was &quot;What doesn&#x27;t kill you makes you stronger&quot;. The first official trailer premiered on January 7, 2005.

When released on DVD in the US on June 21, 2005, two versions were available: the original theatrical version (rated PG-13; 97 minutes), and also an unrated version which contains the footage cut to obtain a PG-13 rating and runs approximately two minutes longer than the original release. The film received its Blu-ray release on September 11, 2012, through Echo Bridge Entertainment, in a double feature with another Wes Craven film, &quot;They&quot; (2002). The disc only contains the theatrical cut. The film was released individually for the first time in the United States on blu-ray by Shout Factory, featuring both the theatrical and extended cut, in April 2022.

In Canada, Alliance Atlantis released the unrated (marketed as &quot;Uncensored&quot;) version only on DVD (as opposed to Dimension Home Video in the US) and the DVD cover was changed to match the original theatrical poster.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Cursed&quot; opened theatrically on February 25, 2005, in 2,805 theatres, taking $9,633,085 in its opening weekend and averaging a mild $3,434 per site. It placed fourth on the box office rankings, following &quot;Diary of a Mad Black Woman&quot; (opening that weekend as well), &quot;Hitch&quot; and &quot;Constantine&quot;. The following weekend, the movie crumbled 60%, grossing $3,867,052 and finishing seventh in the box office charts, with a 10-day sum of $15.3M. &quot;Box Office Guru&quot; dubbed the film&#x27;s performance as &quot;disappointing”. On its third week, the film placed tenth, falling 60% to $1,564,363 for a $17.7 total, marking its last week in the national top ten. &quot;Box Office Guru&quot; predicted a final gross of about $21 million.

&quot;Cursed&quot; ended its theatrical run after 11 weeks on May 12, 2005, with a cumulative domestic gross of $19,294,901. An additional $5.8-$10.3 million internationally brought the worldwide total to between $25.1 and $29.6 million worldwide (sources differ slightly).

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 15% based on 98 reviews, with an average rating of 3.70/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;A predictable plot and cheesy special effects make &quot;Cursed&quot; a less-than-scary experience.&quot; Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 31 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Cursed&quot; is a third-rate effort, with a weak script, cheap-looking effects and no genuine frights.&quot; &quot;Film Threat&quot; stated, &quot;Not that it doesn&#x27;t make movie history. Until this past Friday, the worst werewolf film ever made was, hairy hands down, Mike Nichols&#x27; &quot;Wolf&quot;. &quot;Cursed&quot; now assumes that dubious distinction and someone is going to have to try very hard to wrestle it away.&quot;

Rafe Telsch of Cinema Blend, giving the film 2 out of 5 stars, felt that &quot;&quot;Cursed&quot; isn&#x27;t a bad film, and actually takes a unique approach to modern day genre movies by styling itself as an older one... The film is a fun little romp in the werewolf world, although &quot;Cursed&quot; never really sets any rules for the creatures themselves, leaving itself open to keep cute faces like Ricci&#x27;s uncovered by makeup, but leaving the audience unsatisfied that there aren&#x27;t really many werewolves in this werewolf movie.&quot;

==#ReleaseTheCravenCut campaign==
On October 30, 2018, former Dimension COO Cary Blanat revealed in an interview with Bloody Disgusting that the original footage still exists, which inspired Twitter users and the Sight &amp; Sound podcast calling for Craven&#x27;s cut using the hashtag &quot;#ReleaseTheCravenCut&quot;, with Bloody Disgusting and YouTuber Cody Leach calling it the most anticipated horror movie director&#x27;s cut.

Editor Patrick Lussier commented on the movement in July 2021, stating that a release of the original cut of the film was very unlikely due to the ending never being shot, and also due to a lack of popularity, as opposed to a film like &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot;. Lussier claimed he had no idea who owned the rights to the film due to various Miramax properties reverting to other companies, leaving any future of an alternate cut in doubt.

<doc id="1253853" wikidata="Q7564818" url="?curid=1253853" title="Sound attenuator">
<text>A sound attenuator, or duct silencer, sound trap, or muffler, is a noise control acoustical treatment of Heating Ventilating and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) ductwork designed to reduce transmission of noise through the ductwork, either from equipment into occupied spaces in a building, or between occupied spaces.

In its simplest form, a sound attenuator consists of a baffle within the ductwork. These baffles often contain sound-absorbing materials. The physical dimensions and baffle configuration of sound attenuators are selected to attenuate a specific range of frequencies. Unlike conventional internally-lined ductwork, which is only effective at attenuating mid- and high-frequency noise, sound attenuators can achieve broader band attenuation in relatively short lengths. Certain types of sound attenuators are essentially a Helmholtz resonator used as a passive noise-control device.

== Configuration ==

Generally, sound attenuators consist of the following elements:

* An inner perforated layer of light gauge sheet metal (baffle)
* The baffle is then filled with sound-absorptive insulation
** In high velocity systems, or when there is a concern for particulate matter in the air stream, a bagged or mylar-faced insulation is used.
** Packless sound attenuators do not include sound-absorptive insulation. As a result, the high-frequency insertion loss of a packless sound trap is greatly reduced. Bagged insulation or packless sound attenuators are typically referred to as &quot;hospital grade&quot; attenuators.
* An outer non-perforated layer of sheet metal. The outer layer is typically heavy gauge sheet metal (18ga or stiffer) to minimize duct break-out and break-in noise.
**The gauge of circular sound attenuators is typically less of a consideration, as circular ductwork is considerably stiffer than rectangular ductwork and less prone to duct breakout noise.

Sound attenuators are available in circular and rectangular form factors. Prefabricated rectangular sound attenuators typically come in 3, 5, 7, or 9-ft lengths. The width and height of the sound attenuators are often determined by the surrounding ductwork, though extended media options are available for improved attenuation. The baffles of rectangular sound attenuators are commonly referred to as splitters, whereas circular sound attenuators contain a bullet-shaped baffle.

Sound attenuators are typically classified as &quot;Low,&quot; &quot;Medium,&quot; or &quot;High&quot; based on performance characteristics and/or duct velocity. An example classification scheme is listed below. 
== Properties ==
The acoustical properties of commercially available sound attenuators are tested in accordance with ASTM E477: Standard Test Method for Laboratory Measurements of Acoustical and Airflow Performance of Duct Liner Materials and Prefabricated Silencers. These tests are conducted at NVLAP-accredited facilities and then reported by the manufacturer in marketing or engineering bulletins. Outside of the US, sound attenuators are tested in accordance with British Standard 4718 (legacy) or ISO 7235.

=== Dynamic insertion loss ===

The dynamic insertion loss of a sound attenuator is the amount of attenuation, in decibels, provided by the silencer under flow conditions. While flow conditions in typical low velocity duct systems rarely exceed 2000–3000 ft/min, sound attenuators for steam vents must withstand airflow velocities in the 15,000-20,000 ft/min. range. The acoustic performance of a sound attenuator is tested over a range of airflow velocities, and for forward and reverse flow conditions. Forward flow is when the air and sound waves propagate in the same direction. The insertion loss of a silencer is defined as

formula_1

where:

formula_2= Radiated sound power from the duct with the attenuator

formula_3= Radiated sound power from the duct without the attenuator

Some manufacturers report the static insertion loss of the silencer, which is typically measured with a loudspeaker in lieu of a fan to represent a zero flow condition. These values can be useful in the design of smoke evacuation systems, where sound attenuators are used to attenuate exterior noise that breaks into the exhaust ductwork.

The insertion loss of a sound attenuator is sometimes referred to as transmission loss.

=== Regenerated noise ===
The internal baffles of a sound attenuator constrict airflow, which in turn generates turbulent noise. Noise generated by a sound attenuator is directly related to the airflow velocity at the constriction, and changes proportionally with the face area of the sound attenuator.

The change in generated noise can be expressed as

formula_4

where:

formula_5= The new face area of the sound attenuator

formula_6= Reference face area of the sound attenuator

For example, if the attenuator doubles in width, while maintaining a constant airflow velocity, the generated noise will increase by 3 dB. Conversely, if the attenuator shrinks by a factor of 10, while keeping the airflow velocity constant, the generated noise will decrease by 10 dB. Since turbulence generated noise caused by duct fittings changes at a rate of formula_7, airflow velocities are a critical component of attenuator sizing.

Regenerated noise should always be reviewed, but it is usually only a concern in very quiet rooms (e.g. concert halls, recording studios, music rehearsal rooms) or when the ductwork velocity is greater than 1500 ft/m.

There is a prediction formula that can be used to estimate duct silencer regenerated noise if no data exists

formula_8

where:

formula_9 = sound power level generated by the sound attenuator (dB)

formula_10 = velocity at the constricted cross-area (ft/min)

formula_11 = reference velocity (196.8 ft/min)

formula_12 = number of air passages (number of splitters)

formula_13 = height or circumference of the sound attenuator (in)

formula_14 = reference dimension (0.0394 in)

=== Pressure drop ===

Similar to other duct fittings, sound attenuators cause pressure drop. Catalog pressure drop values obtained through ASTM E477 assume ideal, laminar airflow, which is not allow always found in field installations. The ASHRAE Handbook provides pressure drop correction factors for different inlet and outlet conditions. These correction factors are used whenever there&#x27;s a turbulent wake within 3 to 5 duct diameters upstream or downstream of the attenuator.

Where sound attenuator dimensions differ from surrounding duct dimensions, transitions to and from the sound attenuator should be smooth and gradual. Abrupt transitions cause the pressure drop and regenerated noise to significantly increase.

The pressure drop through a sound attenuator is typically higher than the pressure drop for an equivalent length of lined duct. However, significantly longer lengths of lined duct are required to achieve equal attenuation, at which point the pressure drop of large extents of lined duct is significantly greater than incurred through a single sound attenuator.

Friction losses due to dissipative sound attenuators can be expressed as

formula_15

where:

formula_16 = ratio of the sound attenuator perimeter and area

formula_17 = length of the duct

formula_18 = The friction loss coefficient

formula_19 = density of air

formula_20 = passage velocity

The perimeter, area, and length of the sound attenuator are also parameters which affect its pressure drop. Friction loss at the sound attenuator is directly proportional to its noise attenuation performance, whereby greater attenuation usually equates to greater pressure drop.

== Design variations ==
Prefabricated sound attenuators rose to prominence in the late 1950s-early 1960s. Several manufacturers were among the first to produce and test prefabricated sound attenuators: Koppers, Industrial Acoustics Company, Industrial Sound Control, and Elof Hansson.

Though rectangular dissipative attenuators are the most common variant of attenuators used today in architectural acoustics noise control, other design options exist.

=== Reactive silencers ===
Reactive silencers are very common in muffler design of automobiles and trucks. Attenuation is primarily achieved through sound reflection, area change, and tuned chambers. The design of reactive silencers from scratch is mathematically intensive, so manufacturers often have a number of prefabricated designs.

=== Dissipative silencers ===
Dissipative silencers attenuate sound by transferring sound energy to heat. Dissipative silencers are used when broadband attenuation with low pressure drop is desired. In typical ductwork, high frequencies propagate down the duct as a beam, and minimally interact with the outer, lined edges. Sound attenuators with baffles that break the line of sight or elbow attenuators with a bend provide better high frequency attenuation than conventional lined ductwork. Generally, longer attenuators with thicker baffles will have a greater insertion loss over a wider frequency range.

These types of attenuators are commonly used on air handling units, ducted fan coil units, and at the air intake of compressors, gas turbines, and other ventilated equipment enclosures. On certain air handling unit or fan applications, it is common to use a co-planar silencer—a dissipative silencer that is sized for the fan and mounted directly to the fan outlet. This is a common feature in fan array design.

=== Crosstalk silencers ===
Purpose-built sound attenuators to prevent crosstalk between two closed, private spaces. Their design typically incorporates one or more bends to form a &quot;Z&quot; or &quot;U&quot; shape. This bend increases the efficacy of the sound attenuator without significantly increasing its overall length. Crosstalk attenuators are passive devices and should be sized for extremely low pressure drops — typically less than 0.05 inches w.g.

=== Exhaust registers ===
In the early 1970s, American SF Products, Inc. created the KGE Exhaust Register, which was an air distribution device with an integral sound attenuator.

== Noise control implementation ==
First, the project noise control engineer (or acoustician), mechanical engineer, and equipment representative select the quietest possible equipment which meets the mechanical requirements and budget constraints of the project. Then, the noise control engineers will typically calculate out the path, without the attenuator first. The required sound attenuator insertion loss is the difference between the calculated path and the target background noise level. If no attenuator selection is feasible, the noise control engineer and mechanical must re-evaluate the path between the equipment and the sound attenuator. When space constraints do not allow for a straight attenuator, an elbow or transitional attenuator can be used.

Duct silencers are prominently featured in systems where fiberglass internal duct liner is prohibited. While fiberglass&#x27;s contribution to air quality is insignificant, many higher education projects have adopted a limit on internal fiberglass liner. In these situations, the project acoustician must rely on duct silencers as the primary means of fan noise and duct-borne noise attenuation.

Sound attenuators are typically located near ducted mechanical equipment, to attenuate noise which propagates down the duct. This creates a trade-off: the sound attenuator should be located near the fan and yet the air is typically more turbulent closer to fans and dampers. Ideally, sound attenuators should straddle the wall of the mechanical equipment room provided there are no fire dampers. If a sound attenuator is located over occupied space, the noise control engineer should confirm that duct breakout noise is not an issue prior to the attenuator. If there is significant distance between the attenuator and the mechanical room penetration, additional duct cladding (such as external fiberglass blanket or gypsum lagging) may be required to prevent noise from breaking into the duct and bypassing the attenuator.

Sound attenuators can also be used outdoors to quiet cooling towers, air intake of emergency generators, and exhaust fans. Larger equipment will require an array of sound attenuators, otherwise known as an attenuator bank.

<text>John Marshall Alexander Jr. (June 9, 1929 – December 25, 1954), known by the stage name Johnny Ace, was an American rhythm-and-blues singer. He had a string of hit singles in the mid-1950s. Alexander died of an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 25.

==Life and career==
John Alexander was born in Memphis, Tennessee to Leslie Newsome and preacher John Marshall Alexander, and grew up near LeMoyne-Owen College. He dropped out of high school to join the United States Navy. Alexander was reportedly AWOL for much of his duty. After he was discharged, Alexander joined Adolph Duncan&#x27;s Band as a pianist, playing around Beale Street in Memphis. The network of local musicians became known as the Beale Streeters, which included B. B. King, Bobby Bland, Junior Parker, Earl Forest, and Roscoe Gordon. Initially, they weren&#x27;t an official band, but at times there was a leader and they played on each other&#x27;s records.

In 1951, Ike Turner, a talent scout and producer for Modern Records, arranged for Alexander and other Beale Streeters to record for Turner&#x27;s label. Alexander played piano on some of King&#x27;s records for RPM Records and backed King during broadcasts on WDIA in Memphis. When King departed for Los Angeles and Bland left the group, Alexander took over both Bland&#x27;s vocal duties and King&#x27;s radio show on WDIA.

David James Mattis, program director at WDIA and founder of Duke Records, claimed that he gave Alexander the stage name of Johnny Ace: &quot;Johnny&quot; for Johnny Ray and &quot;Ace&quot; for the Four Aces, but Alexander&#x27;s younger brother St. Clair Alexander claimed that the singer himself came up with the name Ace when Mattis changed his first name from John to Johnny.

Ace signed to Duke in 1952 and released his first recording, &quot;My Song&quot;, an urbane &quot;heart ballad&quot; which topped the R&amp;B chart for nine weeks beginning in September. He began heavy touring, often with Willie Mae &quot;Big Mama&quot; Thornton. In the next two years, Ace had eight hits in a row, including &quot;Cross My Heart&quot;, &quot;Please Forgive Me&quot;, &quot;The Clock&quot;, &quot;Yes, Baby&quot;, &quot;Saving My Love for You&quot;, and &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;.

After Ace had success as a solo artist, the Biharis brothers at Modern released the single &quot;Mid Night Hours Journey&quot; on their subsidiary label Flair Records in September 1953. The flip side was &quot;Trouble and Me&quot; by Earl Forest.

In November 1954, Ace ranked No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 1954 Disk Jockey Poll for R&amp;B Favorite Artists. In December 1954, he was named the Most Programmed Artist of 1954, according to the results of a national poll of disc jockeys conducted by the U.S. trade weekly &quot;Cash Box&quot;. Ace&#x27;s recordings sold very well during those times. Early in 1955, Duke Records announced that three of his 1954 recordings, along with Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, had sold more than 1,750,000 copies.

== Personal life ==
Ace met Lois Jean Palmer, a freshman at Booker T. Washington High School, in 1949. His parents did not know they were dating until she became pregnant. Ace and Palmer were married in Earle, Arkansas, on July 17, 1950; she was 16 and he was 21. Their son, Glenn Alexander, was born later that year. Ace moved Palmer into his parents&#x27; home in Memphis. Ace was barred from the home for playing blues music, so he mostly took residence at the Mitchell Hotel, owned by Sunbeam Mitchell, in Memphis. He had another child with his wife, daughter Janet Alexander, but the couple were rarely together due to his womanizing lifestyle, and by 1953 he had abandoned his family. He also had another son named Larry Saunders, who became a singer. Ace is also the biological grandfather of singer Ledisi.

==Death==
After touring for a year, Ace had been performing at the City Auditorium in Houston, Texas, on Christmas Day 1954. During a break between sets, he was playing with a .32 caliber revolver. Members of Ace&#x27;s band said he did this often, sometimes shooting at roadside signs from their car.

It was widely reported that Ace killed himself playing Russian roulette. However, Curtis Tillman, who was Thorton&#x27;s bass player, witnessed the event. Tillman later said: &quot;I will tell you exactly what happened! Johnny Ace had been drinking and he had this little pistol he was waving around the table and someone said &#x27;Be careful with that thing…&#x27; and he said &#x27;It&#x27;s okay! Gun&#x27;s not loaded… see?&#x27; and pointed it at himself with a smile on his face and &#x27;Bang!&#x27; — sad, sad thing. Big Mama ran out of the dressing room yelling &#x27;Johnny Ace just killed himself!&#x27;&quot;

Big Mama Thornton said in a written statement (included in the book &quot;The Late Great Johnny Ace&quot;) that Ace had been playing with the gun but not playing Russian roulette. According to Thornton, Ace pointed the gun at his girlfriend and another woman who were sitting nearby but did not fire. He then pointed the gun toward himself, bragging that he knew which chamber was loaded. The gun went off, shooting him in the side of the head. According to his biographer Nick Tosches, Ace shot himself with a .32 pistol, not a .22, and it happened little more than an hour after he had bought a new 1955 Oldsmobile.

Ace&#x27;s funeral was held on January 2, 1955 at Clayborn Temple AME church in Memphis. It was attended by an estimated 5,000 people. His remains were buried at New Park Cemetery in Memphis.

&quot;Pledging My Love&quot; was a posthumous R&amp;B number 1 hit for ten weeks beginning February 12, 1955. As &quot;Billboard&quot; bluntly put it, Ace&#x27;s death &quot;created one of the biggest demands for a record that has occurred since the death of Hank Williams just over two years ago.&quot; Thus Johnny Ace became the first act to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts only after death. His single recordings were compiled and released as &quot;The Johnny Ace Memorial Album&quot;.

==Legacy==
Rock-and-roll historian Harry Hepcat noted that &quot;Johnny Ace was a crooner who sounded like Johnny Mathis with soul... Soon after the death of Johnny Ace, Varetta Dillard recorded &#x27;Johnny Has Gone&#x27; for Savoy Records in early 1955. She incorporated many of Ace&#x27;s song titles in the lyrics. This was the first of the many teen tragedy records that were to follow in the later 50s and early 1960s.&quot;

In addition to Dillard&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Has Gone&quot;, at least four other tribute records to Ace were released in 1955: Frankie Ervin&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Ace&#x27;s Last Letter&quot;; The Rovers&#x27; &quot;Salute To Johnny Ace&quot;; Linda Hayes&#x27; &quot;Why, Johnny, Why?&quot;; and The Five Wings’ &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Still Singing&quot;.

Bob Dylan and Joan Baez performed &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; on tour with the Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975. Luther Vandross covered this song in 1993 as the title track to his eighth studio album. Elvis Presley recorded &quot;Pledging My Love&quot; in his last studio session, in 1976; the song appeared on the album &quot;Moody Blue&quot; in 1977.

Paul Simon wrote and performed the song &quot;The Late Great Johnny Ace&quot; (1983), in which a boy, upon hearing of the death of Ace, orders a photograph of the deceased singer: &quot;It came all the way from Texas/With a sad and simple face/And they signed it on the bottom/From the Late Great Johnny Ace.&quot; The song develops a touching counterpoint with the death of two other Johnnies – John Lennon and John F. Kennedy.

David Allan Coe covered &quot;Pledging My Love&quot;, introducing the song with his own recollections of hearing the news of Ace&#x27;s death.

Ace is mentioned in &quot;House Band in Hell&quot;, by Root Boy Slim, and in the song &quot;Johnny Ace&quot;, by Dash Rip Rock.

&quot;Pledging My Love&quot; was used in the 1973 film &quot;Mean Streets&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese; the 1983 film &quot;Christine&quot;, directed by John Carpenter; the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, directed by Robert Zemeckis; and the 1992 film &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot;, directed by Abel Ferrara.

The Teen Queens&#x27; song &quot;Eddie My Love&quot;, originally entitled &quot;Johnny My Love&quot;, was written in memory of Ace.

The Swiss singer Polo Hofer and the Schmetterband wrote the song &quot;Johnny Ace&quot; in 1985; it was released on the album &quot;Giggerig&quot;.
Will Oldham noted Ace&#x27;s death in the lyrics of his song &quot;Let the Wires Ring&quot;, on his 2000 album &quot;Guarapero/Lost Blues 2&quot;.

Dave Alvin&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Eleven Eleven&quot;, contains the song &quot;Johnny Ace Is Dead&quot;, about Ace&#x27;s death.

The Squirrel Nut Zippers&#x27; Christmas album, &quot;Christmas Caravan&quot; (1998), contains the song &quot;A Johnny Ace Christmas&quot;, a love song about Ace killing himself on Christmas.

<text>Jean-François Paillard (12 April 1928 – 15 April 2013) was a French conductor.

He was born in Vitry-le-François and received his musical training at the Conservatoire de Paris, where he won first prize in music history, and the Salzburg Mozarteum.

He also earned a degree in mathematics at the Sorbonne.

In 1953, he founded the Jean-Marie Leclair Instrumental Ensemble, which in 1959 became the &quot;Orchestre de Chambre Jean-François Paillard&quot;. The ensemble has made recordings of much of the Baroque repertoire for Erato Records and has toured throughout Europe and the United States. It has also recorded with many leading French instrumentalists, including Maurice André, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Pierre Pierlot, Lily Laskine, Jacques Lancelot, Michel Arrignon.

A 1968 recording by the orchestra of the &quot;Canon and Gigue for 3 violins and basso continuo&quot; by Johann Pachelbel, familiarly known as Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon, nearly single-handedly brought the piece from obscurity to great renown. The recording was done in a more Romantic style, at a significantly slower tempo than it had been played at before, and contained obligato parts, written by Paillard, that are now closely associated with the piece. It was released on an Erato Records album, and was also included on a widely distributed album by mail-order label Musical Heritage Society album in 1968. The recording began to get significant attention in the United States, particularly in San Francisco, during the early 1970s. By the late 1970s various renditions of it were topping classical music charts in the U.S., including Paillard&#x27;s own. The Paillard Chamber Orchestra&#x27;s recording was also prominently featured in the soundtrack of the 1980 film &quot;Ordinary People&quot;.

Paillard released 307 records.

He also appeared frequently as a guest conductor with other orchestras and was active as an author. He edited the series &quot;Archives de la Musique Instrumentale&quot; and published &quot;La musique française classique&quot; in 1960.

He died on 15 April 2013, three days after his 85th birthday.

<doc id="1253868" wikidata="Q2617262" url="?curid=1253868" title="Colin Healy">
<text>Colin Healy (born 14 March 1980) is an Irish football manager and former player. He was appointed manager of Cork City F.C. in late 2020, and held the post until May 2023.

He started his senior career at Celtic, spending five years with the Scottish club before joining English side Sunderland in 2003, where he spent three years. He returned to Scotland in 2006 to sign for Livingston. After a short spell with Livingston he returned to England to join Barnsley. After leaving Barnsley in 2007, he joined Irish side Cork City, where he spent two years before joining English side Ipswich Town. He spent two years with Ipswich before returning to the Republic of Ireland to sign for former club Cork City. Healy represented the Republic of Ireland at youth and senior level. He made his senior debut for his country in 2002, going on to win 13 caps, scoring once.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Healy was born in Ballincollig, County Cork. He came from a sporting family, with his grandfather Paddy Healy having been a Gaelic footballer and hurler who won All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship medals with the Cork inter-county football and hurling teams respectively in 1945 and 1946. Healy played local soccer with Ballincollig and then Wilton United. He attended the FAS/FAI course in Cork run by former Celtic and Cork City midfielder Mike Conroy and from here he was taken to Celtic Park. He would go on to score three goals for Celtic, his first coming in a league game against Dundee in February 2000. His other two goals came in Scottish League Cup ties against Hearts and Stirling Albion. With Celtic he won a Scottish League Cup medal, playing in the team that beat Kilmarnock 3–0 at Hampden on 18 March 2001.

===Sunderland===
Sunderland signed Healy from Celtic in 2003. In December 2003 he broke his leg in a match against a former loan club, Coventry City after a challenge by Moroccan international Youssef Safri.

In October 2004, he broke his leg again soon after resuming training with Sunderland, after a tackle from then manager Mick McCarthy. In January 2006, it was announced that Healy&#x27;s contract with Sunderland had expired, and the midfielder left the club.

===Livingston and Barnsley===
Healy joined SPL club Livingston on 10 March 2006 until the end of the season. On 10 August 2006 Healy signed a one-year contract with Barnsley. Having made only 10 appearances for Barnsley, he had his contract cancelled by mutual consent.

===Cork City and FIFA case===
On 20 February 2007 he signed a two-year contract with hometown League of Ireland club Cork City, alongside former international colleague Gareth Farrelly. FIFA ruled both players to be unable to play for the club, citing a rule forbidding players from transferring between clubs more than twice in a 12-month period between July and June. FIFA rejected appeals made by both players. On 1 July 2007 both Healy and Gareth Farrelly became eligible to play for Cork City. On this date, they both played for the club&#x27;s under-21 team against Lifford of Ennis, Co Clare, winning the game 2–0.

Healy made his full Cork City debut against Bohemians when they were beaten in extra time in the Eircom League Cup Quarter Final held at Dalymount Park on 3 July 2007.

Healy signed a two-year contract for Cork in 2009. In April 2009, Healy scored his first goal for Cork at Tallaght Stadium.

===Ipswich Town===
On 16 July 2009, it was confirmed that Cork City had accepted a £100,000 bid from Hartlepool United to take Healy and fellow Cork City teammate Denis Behan to Victoria Park, Hartlepool. However, five days later, Hartlepool United manager Chris Turner confirmed that the deal had not happened due to late interest from Ipswich Town. Healy subsequently signed for Ipswich for an undisclosed fee. In January 2010, he signed on-loan with Scottish Premier League club Falkirk. At Falkirk he scored once against Aberdeen.

Returning to Ipswich from the on-loan spell in Scotland, during the League Cup Semi-Final 2011 first leg win by Ipswich Town over Arsenal, it was commented that &quot;Colin Healy made Cesc Fabregas look like Colin Healy&quot;. In February 2011 Healy scored his first goal for Ipswich against Doncaster Rovers. His contract was terminated by mutual consent in November 2011.

===Return to Cork City===
In 2013, Healy returned to Cork City on a three-year deal. His most memorable moment came against St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic in 2014 when he scored a late over head kick against a fellow title rival. He and Cork finished runners up behind Dundalk for three years in a row and Healy lost the 2015 FAI Cup to Dundalk before finally winning a trophy in March 2016 in the Presidents Cup and the 2016 FAI Cup final where he came off the bench. He retired from playing in April 2017.

==Coaching career==
After retirement from playing he was Cork City&#x27;s &quot;head of academy&quot; for a number of seasons before being appointed &quot;first team head coach&quot; in December 2020. He resigned the post in May 2023. On 13 February 2024, he was named as Eileen Gleeson&#x27;s assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland women&#x27;s national team alongside Emma Byrne on a permanent basis, having been in the role since 2023 while Gleeson was originally in interim charge of the team.

==International career==
Healy played and scored a goal against Australia at the FIFA World Youth Championship finals in Nigeria in 1999.

He represented his country at the UEFA U-19 Championship in Sweden in 1999, and won a bronze medal.

During the Saipan incident between Mick McCarthy and fellow Cork man Roy Keane at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Healy was called upon by McCarthy as the replacement should Keane be dropped from the squad. A succession of changes-of-heart by the Manchester United player led to the call-up being delayed and the deadline passing, with Healy unable to join the World Cup squad.
