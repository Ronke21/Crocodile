<text>The Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia (PCEA) is a small Presbyterian denomination which was formed in Sydney on 10 October 1846 by three ministers and a ruling elder. As of December 2024 it consists of 11 pastoral charges with a total of 14 regular preaching places, 6 serving ministers, 2 ministers without charge, 3 retired ministers and a community of about 500 (including about 350 communicant members).

==Origins==
In October 1840 the Presbyterian ministers then in mainland Australia formed the &quot;Synod of Australia in connection with the Established Church of Scotland&quot;. However, the movement in the Established Church of Scotland, which resulted in the exodus of about 40% of the ministers in 1843 to form the Free Church of Scotland, had repercussions in Australia. Ultimately the Australian Synod decided to retain its legal and moral connection with the Established Church despite the acceptance of what was considered improper State interference by that body, contrary to the Confession of Faith. This led to Rev William McIntyre (Maitland), Rev John Tait (Parramatta), Rev Colin Stewart (Bowenfels) and Samuel Martin (Hunter elder) protesting and constituting a new Synod on the original basis. While independent of the Free Church of Scotland, the PCEA received its ministers from that source in the early years. In far-off Melbourne, James Forbes of Scots Church also protested and withdrew. He formed the Free Presbyterian Church of Australia Felix (afterwards Victoria). The remnant of this body joined the PCEA in 1953.

==History==
The revolution caused by the discovery of gold in 1851, brought more ministers and a vastly increased population. The three Presbyterian divisions then existing in Australia – representing the Established, Free and United Presbyterian Church of Scotland streams – achieved union over the years 1859/1865. Sections of the latter two streams remained apart, the Free because of the practical compromise considered to be involved in the united body receiving ministers from the different streams, despite the Free Church of Scotland policy from 1858 being in favour of colonial unions. It was considered that diversity of view at this point established an attitude which would lead to diversity on other points at the very heart of the faith. There was also concern that toleration of a view point found among United Presbyterians could lead to the secular ideal of the state, which indeed developed in the 20th century. The PCEA became a very active body, although short of ministers until 1853.

Seven of the 22 PCEA ministers in November 1864 stayed out of the union. Most early PCEA members were Highland Scots or conservative Irish Presbyterians. The PCEA grew to 12 ministers within a few years of 1864, despite the death of early leaders, but suffered a serious schism in 1884 over the training of students. This was not healed until the 20th century, and much ground was lost. A section of the Brushgrove-Grafton congregation was not reconciled and joined the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland in 1911. [The descendants of this group have a church in Grafton and another in Riverstone (Sydney).] Additionally there was no recognition by the Free Church of Scotland from 1864 until after 1900, when close relations were resumed with the section that stayed outside the union which formed the United Free Church of Scotland in 1900. There was a painful dispute in the 1970s which led to a minister who made exaggerated claims for the King James Version of the Bible being removed in 1979. The repercussions contributed to several ministers joining the Presbyterian Church of Australia. The New International Version (1984) or the New King James Version are the most generally used translations at present. Of recent times the church has been stable with increasing diversity of ethnic origins represented in its membership and ministerial ranks. Until recent years the membership was largely outside major cities. Currently (2017) about 60% of the following is in the capital cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.

==Distinctive position==
The PCEA is distinguished from the Presbyterian Church of Australia (PCA) by adherence to &quot;the whole doctrine&quot; of the Confession of Faith as adopted by the Church of Scotland in 1647 and vindicated in the Scottish Disruption of 1843. It does not have what it considers an ambiguous Declaratory Statement, such as that of the PCA, which includes allowance of &quot;liberty of opinion on matters not essential to the doctrine&quot; without defining what is essential. Despite this difference there have been many strong connections with the PCA, particularly since it has moved to a more conservative theological position since 1977. One minister served as Professor in the PCA&#x27;s Theological College in Melbourne (1977–81), another as Principal of Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College (Melbourne) (1986–97), and another has written extensively on Australian Presbyterian history.

The PCEA is often noted for its practice of exclusive psalmody. This is the maintenance of the older pre-1870 approach to public worship among Presbyterians in which the 150 psalms of the Word of God in metrical form were exclusively used, and without instrumental accompaniment. The Scottish Psalter of 1650 was traditionally used in the PCEA, but is now supplanted in most congregations by more modern versions either the version produced by Melbourne PCEA in 1991, or the version produced by the Free Church of Scotland in 2003. The principle behind the practice of exclusive psalmody is that Scripture should regulate our worship and that we cannot do better than to use the Word of God in the public worship. The actions of the Free Church of Scotland in November 2010 in relaxing its stance on &quot;a capella&quot; psalmody have no bearing on the practice of the PCEA.

==Organisation==
The PCEA’s supreme assembly is a Synod which meets annually hosted by one of the congregations. The PCEA has a long-standing arrangement enabling ready interchange of ministers with the Free Church of Scotland, and is a member of the International Conference of Reformed Churches (ICRC). More recently, interchange of ministers with the Reformed Churches of New Zealand (2006) and with the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in the US (2007), both also ICRC members, has been approved. The PCEA does not operate its own theological college, but has trained ministers in the Free Church of Scotland College, Edinburgh, at the Reformed Theological College, Geelong, and, more recently, in the training institutions of the mainline Presbyterian Church, supplemented in certain subjects. In Victoria it has friendly relations with the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Australia which has congregations at Geelong, Frankston and MacKinnon, and whose presence in Australia also dates from colonial times.

The current communicant membership (31/12/2017) is about 450 with a total community of about 800. At the same date there were 11 ministers in pastoral charges and another seconded to provide leadership for Australian Indigenous Ministries (formerly Aboriginal Inland Mission). A significant work has developed among Sudanese refugees in Melbourne, with one minister from the Nuer people of South Sudan.

The main centres are:
*Northern Presbytery: Brisbane (Woolowin); Northern Rivers (Maclean, Grafton); Hastings (Wauchope, Port Macquarie) 
*Central Presbytery: Manning (Taree); Hunter (Queens Avenue, Cardiff, Raymond Terrace); Sydney: St Georges, 201a Castlereagh Street, Mount Druitt, Bexley North 
*Southern Presbytery: Geelong (Newcomb), Melbourne - Knox (Wantirna), All Nations (Mulgrave); Carrum Downs; Narre Warren; Ulverstone, Tasmania

<text>François Marie Edouard Migault (4 December 1944 – 29 January 2012) was a racing driver from Le Mans, France. He participated in 16 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 13 August 1972, but scored no championship points.

==Career==
A native of Le Mans, he also entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans race 25 times, between 1972 and 2002.

Migault&#x27;s first attempt in Formula One in was with the small, underfunded Connew team that managed to start in only one race. In , he drove almost a complete season with British Racing Motors after both BRM drivers of 1973, Niki Lauda and Clay Regazzoni, had moved to Ferrari.

In , a few races with the ill-fated Embassy Hill team and Williams followed. In Formula Two that year, Migault achieved some success with an Osella FA2, scoring one point.

Migault continued to compete at Le Mans until he was in his mid-fifties and achieved a best finish of second in 1976, together with two other podium finishes.

Migault died on 29 January 2012 after a long battle with cancer.

<doc id="1228367" wikidata="Q172799" url="?curid=1228367" title="Fred Gamble (racing driver)">
<text>Frederick Kesner Gamble (March 17, 1932 – March 30, 2024) was an American racecar driver. He participated in one Formula One Grand Prix, the 1960 Italian Grand Prix, on September 4, 1960. He finished 10th overall driving the Formula Two Behra-Porsche, scoring no Championship points. Gamble died in Honolulu, Hawaii on March 30, 2024, at the age of 92.

==Early life==
Fred Kesner Gamble was born on March 17, 1932, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His family moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after the Second World War. During his time at Fort Lauderdale, he was exposed to sports cars, which gave him a passion for motorsports. He would later get a job at a local race track selling refreshments, which allowed him to make connections with racers. Gamble graduated from Fort Lauderdale High School in 1950 and joined the Air Force as a radio operator during The Korean War. After leaving the military, he attended California Polytechnic State University, and later the University of Florida. He was involved with racing clubs at both schools.

==Racing==
During his last semester in college, he spotted a disassembled Crosley Hot Shot, and talked its owner into a straight trade for his Zündapp motorcycle. Gamble discarded the body and in the local VW dealership (was a part-time salesman) fabricated a feather-weight aluminum body, stock 750cc motor and called his HM special a Gambini MK1 and on his soon to earn international license, himself – Fredrico Gambini!

In his first national race (May 1958, Gainesville, Georgia) he had a long race duel with a Le Mans DB and finished second in H Modified. Gamble was hired by Jarrard Motors of Pensacola, a foreign car importer for Renault, Triumph, AC Cars and Borgward servicing 200 dealers in eleven south east states. He was the assistant advertising manager and Triumph race team driver with Bill Kimberly. Jarrard raced a team of 3 TR3s and Gamble was assigned to Sedan class battles with the new TR10 (1,000 cc Standard 10) to dice with VWs, Renault Dauphines, and Morris Minors.

When Jarrard decided not to run the Factory Triumph team at Sebring in 1959, and stop his SCCA racing, Gamble resigned and returned to South Florida, to race an MGA for a University of Miami student.

From the mid-1950s, Gamble had been a motoring journalist and contributor to Chris Economaki&#x27;s &quot;National Speed Sport News&quot;, The SCCA magazine &quot;Sports Car&quot;, Denise McCluggage&#x27;s &quot;Competition Press&quot; and &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;.

At a mid-summer SCCA race in Miami, while racing the MGA, Gamble met Lloyd &quot;Lucky&quot; Casner, ex airline pilot, car dealer and successful racing driver in a string of cars – MGs, Alfas, AC Bristols, Maseratis and Ferraris. Lucky announced at the victory presentation that he wanted to go race in Europe (didn&#x27;t we all?). He invited the amateur racers to contribute to a fund to finance his idea. He got a good laugh from the crowd.

Gamble knew Casner was a hustler/promoter, introduced himself with the suggestion he go along as a helper, publicist &amp; pay his own way as a motoring journalist. Casner suggested a partnership to make his idea happen.

Gamble put on his thinking cap, college degree in advertising/PR/Journalism/Marketing, and inspired by Ecurie Ecosse, the Scottish National Racing Team that spawned Jim Clark and later Jackie Stewart, created the concept of America&#x27;s &quot;Olympic Team&quot; of motor racing to challenge the Europeans for World Championships.

Casner&#x27;s amateur racing team of friends called themselves Camoradi Racing Team (Casner Motor Racing Division) as a tax write-off probably. So the proposed professional team was incorporated as Camoradi USA, America&#x27;s first industry sponsored racing team with the best drivers from all race series in the best cars that could be acquired.

&quot;Lucky&quot; was an understatement. Goodyear was just getting into sportscar racing (Jan 59) and signed up with substantial financial support and all tires needed. Chevrolet&#x27;s president, Ed Cole and Zora Duntov, signed up with covert financial support (Engineering Dept.), two Corvettes with all competition options, funneled thru Don Allen Chevrolet, Miami. &quot;Covert&quot; because of an industry management ban on racing support. These first two backers opened the corporate doors to Shell/BP, Exide, Champion, DA Lubricants, Koni, Dow and Guest Airways (Mexico to Paris via Miami).

Casner took off to Europe in September (59) and approached bankrupt Maserati who had their new Birdcage T61, a world beater but no finances to race a factory team. Camoradi was their answer for 1960. Casner also formed an alliance with Porsche&#x27;s Huschke Von Hanstein and bought two cars from the late Jean Behra&#x27;s estate – a lightweight Carrera and the special Behra-Porsche F2, which served as a test bed and prototype for Porsche&#x27;s 1960 F2 cars and 1962 F1 1,500cc Formula.

Due to his long association with Maserati, Stirling Moss muscled his way into Camoradi, thus polluting the all-American idea. Camoradi&#x27;s driver roster: Jim Rathman, Roger Ward, Carroll Shelby, Masten Gregory, Dan Gurney, Juan Fangio(Parade lap at Cordova, Argentina 1960), Chuck Daigh, Jo Bonnier, Jack Mcafee, Jim Jeffords, Bill Weustoff, Fred Windridge, Joe Sheppard, Dick Dungan, Pinkie Windridge, Denise McCluggage, Umberto Maglioli, Nino Vaccarella, Nino Todaro, Gino Munaron, Giorgio Scarlatti, Lucky Casner, Lee Lilley, Fred Gamble, Dave Lane, and Johnny Cuevas.

Camoradi &quot;works&quot; Maseratis, led every World Sports Car Championship race of 1960, and won only 1,000 km Nurburgring with Gurney/Moss. Led Nassau 1959 (Shelby DNF Mechanical), Porsche RSK 2 Liter winner (Bonnier), GT winner Porsche Carrera (Cuevas); 1960 1,000 km Buenos Aires (Gurney/Gregory DNF Mechanical and accident); Argentine GP (Gregory Behra-Porsche); Havana GP for Sports Cars – 8 car entre, winning overall Moss Maserati, 2 Liter Gregory Porsche RSK, GT Corvette Jeffords, under 2 liter GT Cuevas Porsche Carrera; Sebring 12 hour, largest team entry ever of 8 cars, 3 Maseratis (Gurney/Moss led 8 hours DNF Mechanical), 2 Porsche Carrera (under 2 liter GT winner and 2nd OA GT Sheppard/Dungan), 2 Corvettes Jeffords/Weustoff/Gamble (Gamble drove 12 hours solo – only one of two known to have done this – earned press notice as &quot;iron man Gamble&quot;). OSCA 750 (McCluggage/Windridge DNF).

At the Nurburgring, Gamble qualified the &quot;Yank Tank&quot; Corvette 3rd among the big GTs, several 250 GT Ferraris but did not get to drive in the race as co-driver Lee Lilley started the race and DNF with wheel bearing failure. Gurney/Moss won overall in the team&#x27;s T61 Maserati, Gregory/Munaron 4th.

Off to Le Mans 24 hours, Gregory/Daigh led with the famed Streamliner Birdcage Maserati, set a 3-liter lap record and top speed record of 170Mph, DNF engine failure, other two long tail Maseratis DNF with electrical faults. Gamble/Lilley drove their Corvette conservatively to finish 10th OA.

All Camoradi Maseratis were prepared and maintained by the factory and in Europe race managed by Maserati. Camoradi&#x27;s role was primarily financial. Gamble was the only full-time principal in Europe, living in Modena, Casner frequently back in Miami.

Sad ending to Gamble&#x27;s Le Mans story was to find out years later they had been excluded due to insufficient miles covered under the index of performance rules. Even though at the race awards event, they were announced as 10th OA and awarded their participants medals. In 9th OA, just ahead of Gamble/Lilley was the 1959 OA winner Aston-Martin DBR1 and in 8th the Cunningham Corvette of Fitch/Grossman.

Gamble was approved to drive the Behra-Porsche in the 1960 German GP where the car was used by the factory in practice. Porsche manager Von Hanstein changed his mind at the last minute and denied Gamble the car as it had a &quot;works&quot; engine installed.

For the GP of Europe at Monza, September 4, 1960, Ferrari pushed the organizers to use the rough high banks to scare off the British rear engine cars. Chapman of Lotus led the boycott, rightly so as his fragile cars would likely have broken up. This boycott opened the entry for Formula Two cars so Gamble entered the Camoradi Behra-Porsche for himself as driver and for starting money! Designer Collotti and builder Neri were in Gamble&#x27;s pit and were sure the car could run the 500 km race non-stop for fuel. So Gamble paced himself 500 rpm below redline, running 8th OA and 1st Privateer F2, when he was stranded out of fuel, ran to the pits for a can of gas and dashed across the line for 10th. Winner was Phil Hill in his works F1 Ferrari.

Gamble and team mechanic New Zealander Bob Wallace (who stayed in Modena and became Lamborghini&#x27;s Chief Test Engineer) took the Corvette and a Maserati to the Swedish GP for sports cars. Jo Bonnier drove the Birdcage to 2nd OA behind Moss in the first Lotus 19. Casner won the GT category. Bonnier then took both cars to a super highway and set a Swedish &quot;Land Speed&quot; record in the Maser and GT record in the Corvette.

Gamble had a starting money paid entry in the Goodwood Tourist Trophy race. Moss was the favorite in Rob Walker&#x27;s 250GT Ferrari. Gamble was confident his long wearing Goodyear tires would be an advantage on this notorious tire grinder circuit (as it was for Dunlop and Avon). Sadly, in southern Sweden after a lunch stop with beer, Wallace apparently dozed off, flipped and destroyed the Corvette.

Gamble left Camoradi in October, dismayed by big spending Lucky Casner, abusing the team&#x27;s sponsors trust.

At December&#x27;s 1960 Nassau, Gamble was there as a journalist, looking for a ride as well and was approached by racing patron Frank Harrison of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Harrison had bought the ex-Camoradi Le Mans Streamliner and had just won the U.S.A. pro sports car Championship with Carroll Shelby and Jim Jeffords. Harrison proposal for Gamble to drive his Streamliner Birdcage and 450S Maseratis in National SCCA events, not abuse his cars and learn the circuits for the 1961 season; for 1962, buy the latest Cooper or Lotus and go for a National Championship. If that was achieved, he would go into a Formula One challenge for 1963. A dream opportunity.

Gamble was at Sebring 1961 as a reserve driver for Denise McCluggage and her inexperienced co-driver Alan Eager who might not have been approved for the race. Denise had her 250GT Ferrari, Alan was accepted and they won the GT category.

Gamble started the 1961 season at the first National race at Marlboro, Maryland, finishing second to Bob Holbert (lap record holder). He drove through the first half of the season, leading in points after several races but the team was coming unraveled in discord due to a difficult shop manager. This could not be resolved so Gamble left the Harrison operation and racing. He moved to New York and landed a Job as Assistant Advertising Manager, Standard-Triumph North America for the introduction of the TR4. Gamble and his Triumph boss Mike Cook pioneered the Triumph competition program, which was soon adopted by other manufacturers (another story). Also Gamble and Cook &quot;GodFathered&quot; Bob Tullius which evolved into his extremely successful Group 44.

At the end of the 1961 year, the SCCA announced its season champions and Gamble was 3rd in points to Roger Penske and Walt Hansgen.

Summer of 1962, Carroll Shelby presented his first Cobra to Ford, won their support and went the New York to show off his new car to the International Motor Press Association. Gamble was a member. He and Shelby sat together at the luncheon and Carroll said he had to set up a company to produce his Cobras. He hired Gamble as his first Sales Manager. Off to Venice, California. Two months later at the Riverside Sports Car GP and the first race for the Cobra, Shelby and Gamble got together with Goodyear&#x27;s General Manager of Racing, Tony Webner. Over drinks and dinner Webner expounded his plans to expand Goodyear in racing and he needed another assistant. Shelby was the western states Goodyear racing tire distributor and commented that he needed Goodyear as well Ford&#x27;s support to go to Europe and &quot;kick Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s ass&quot; for the World GT Championship. The result was Goodyear bought Gamble. He, Webner and Shelby schemed through the 1963 season to convince Goodyear management to approve an International Racing Tire Division. Gamble was appointed its founding Director.

February 1964, Gamble and his Chief Engineer Walt DeVinney established their headquarters at the Goodyear plant in Wolverhampton, England. In just 5 years, Gamble and his team had racked up seven World Championships and 3 Le Mans victories (Ferrari 1965, Ford 1966–1967), Goodyear&#x27;s first Formula One win (Ginther/Honda-Mexico 65) and Gurney&#x27;s historic All-American 1967 Belgian GP win.

Gamble turned over Goodyear Racing in 1968 to Leo Mehl and transferred to General Management. Gamble&#x27;s collection photos, video and memorabilia are at the Watkins Glen research center, Watkins Glen, New York in 3 sections: Goodyear the early years, Camoradi USA and Gamble personal.

<text>Frederick G. Wacker Jr. (July 10, 1918 Chicago – June 16, 1998) was an engineer and former president of two large Chicago companies. He was also a prominent Chicago socialite, a jazz musician, and a racing driver. He participated in five Formula One World Championship races, debuting on June 21, 1953. He scored no championship points. He also participated in several non-Championship Formula One races.

Wacker was the grandson of Charles H. Wacker, the first chairman of the Chicago Plan Commission and the man for whom Wacker Drive in Chicago is named. He attended The Hotchkiss School and Yale University. He worked with AC Spark Plug before enlisting in the United States Navy.

Wacker was involved in a fatal accident during the second lap of the 1952 Watkins Glen Grand Prix, which at the time was a street course. While preparing for a right hand turn, his Allard J2 came dangerously close to a Cunningham driven by John Fitch, and both drivers swerved to avoid a collision. The back end of the Allard came out slightly to the left and closer to a throng of spectators sitting on the curb along the side of the course. Ten people were injured and a 7-year-old boy was killed. The tragedy caused the end of street racing at the Glen and elsewhere in the United States.

<text>Geoffrey Crossley (11 May 1921 – 7 January 2002) was a British racing driver from England. He participated in two World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 13 May 1950. He scored no championship points. He also participated in numerous non-Championship Formula One races.

==Racing career==
By profession, Geoffrey Crossley was a furniture manufacturer, but he had been a keen amateur racing driver since just before World War II. Following the war he maintained his interest, and competed in a few races using a pre-war Alta, including the 1947 British Empire Trophy race on the Isle of Man.

In 1949 he bought an Alta GP Grand Prix car, GP2, from the manufacturer, in Surrey. Made to order, the car featured a sleeker bodywork than its predecessors. With it, Crossley took International Class F ( to ) standing start speed records over 50 km (125.92 mph), 50 miles (124.49 mph) and 100 km (124.17 mph) at the Montlhéry circuit in late 1949. Crossley also campaigned the Alta GP in selected races in 1949, including the 1949 Belgian Grand Prix, where he finished seventh and last, six laps down on the winner.

The following year he took part in the first ever World Championship Formula One race: the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone Circuit. He qualified in 17th place, three places ahead of Joe Kelly in a similar Alta, despite the latter&#x27;s higher specification engine. Crossley&#x27;s race ended with transmission failure on lap 43. Later that season Crossley entered the Alta for the 1950 Belgian Grand Prix, where he qualified 12th and finished in ninth position. In addition to his Championship entries, Crossley also took part in a number of non-Championship races in the Alta, but at the end of the 1950 season he decided to retire due to the high costs of the sport.

He made a brief return to motorsport in 1955, after he built a Lea-Francis-engined special which he called the Berkshire Special. Crossley entered the car for the 1955 Richmond Trophy race at Goodwood Circuit, but teething troubles with the car meant that he was slowest in practice and he decided to withdraw from the event. Owing to work and family commitments Crossley abandoned the Berkshire Special&#x27;s development, and withdrew from racing for good.

Geoffrey Crossley died from a stroke, in the John Radcliffe Hospital, on 7 January 2002.

<text>Geoffrey Thompson Lees (born 1 May 1951) is a British former racing driver from England. He participated in 12 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, making his first appearance on 16 July 1978. He scored no championship points.

==Career==
Lees was born near Kingsbury, Warwickshire. His first Grand Prix chance came with a non-works Ensign ran by Mario Deliotti, the owner of an Alfa Romeo dealership in Birmingham, at his home race in 1978. Lees failed to qualify. The following year he had a one-off drive for Tyrrell, before a more regular ride with the struggling Shadow team in 1980. Later that year he also drove for the works Ensign team, and failed to qualify a RAM-entered Williams in the US. He participated in the Formula One non-championship race held on 7 February 1981 at Kyalami for Theodore where he went into the crash barriers on lap 11 due to a broken front suspension. In the hope of taking one step backward and then two steps forward, he joined Ralt-Honda for the European Formula Two championship. He won the championship, but his hopes of &quot;re-entering Formula One with more dignity&quot; were quashed when Honda decided to spend another year developing their F1 engine. Lees, one year ahead of Honda failed to find a good seat at the highest level, and his F1 career petered out in 1982 with single drives for Theodore and Lotus.

In his Formula One career, Lees seemed stuck in uncompetitive cars, and when success proved elusive, he moved to Japan in the early 1980s. There he enjoyed a long career in the Japanese Formula Two, winning the 1983 title and collecting eight wins. He also represented various Japanese marques in sports car racing championships such as the Fuji Grand Champion Series, where he won three titles in 1986, 1988 and 1989, and the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, where he got the C-class title in 1992. Lees became a highly paid and highly respected part of the Japanese racing scene. He has also driven at Le Mans numerous times, with his best finish being a sixth place overall in 1990.

<text>George John Constantine (February 22, 1918 – January 7, 1968) was a racing driver from the United States. He competed nationally in 108 races between 1953 and 1962, winning 17 times.

Constantine was the United States Sports Car Driver of the Year in 1960. He won the 1959 Nassau Trophy race and the 1956 grand prix at Watkins Glen (in a Jaguar D-type). He set course records at Lime Rock, (1:05.81), and Marlboro, in 1958, and he was one of the top-rated competitors in the 1959 Daytona, Fla. international speedway race.
Constantine was known as the &quot;King of Lime Rock&quot; and &quot;The Flying Greek.&quot; His most famous car with the most victories was the rare and fabulous Aston Martin DBR2/1 (owned by Elisha Walker, Jr.), and his mechanic was Rex Woodgate.

<doc id="1228380" wikidata="Q334310" url="?curid=1228380" title="Overtraining">
<text>Overtraining occurs when a person exceeds their body&#x27;s ability to recover from strenuous exercise. Overtraining can be described as a point where a person may have a decrease in performance and plateauing as a result of failure to consistently perform at a certain level or training load; a load which exceeds their recovery capacity. People who are overtrained cease making progress, and can even begin to lose strength and fitness. Overtraining is also known as chronic fatigue, burnout and overstress in athletes. It is suggested that there are different variations of overtraining, firstly monotonous program over training suggest that repetition of the same movement such as certain weight lifting and baseball batting can cause performance plateau due to an adaption of the central nervous system which results from a lack of stimulation. A second example of overtraining is described as chronic overwork type training where the subject may be training with too high intensity or high volume and not allowing sufficient recovery time for the body. Up to 10% of elite endurance athletes and 10% of American college swimmers are affected by overtraining syndrome (unexplained underperformance for approximately 2 weeks even after having adequate resting time).

== Signs and symptoms ==
Listed below are some of the common effects and cited signs of overtraining.

Overtraining may be accompanied by one or more concomitant symptoms:
* Persistent muscle soreness
* Persistent fatigue, different from just being tired from a hard training session, occurs when fatigue continues even after adequate rest.
* Elevated resting heart rate, a persistently high heart rate after adequate rest such as in the morning after sleep, can be an indicator of overtraining.
* Reduced heart rate variability
* Increased susceptibility to infections
* Increased incidence of injuries
* Irritability
* Depression
* Mental breakdown
* Burnout

It is important to note the difference between overtraining and over-reaching; over-reaching is when an athlete is undergoing hard training but with adequate recovery, overtraining however, is when an athlete is undergoing hard training without the adequate recovery. With over-reaching, the consequential drop in performance can be resolved in a few days or weeks.

=== Performance ===
* Early onset of fatigue
* Decreased aerobic capacity (VO2 max)
* Poor physical performance
* Inability to complete workouts
* Delayed recovery

Overtraining can affect the athlete&#x27;s athletic ability and other areas of life, such as performance in studies or the work force. An overtrained athlete who is suffering from physical and or psychological symptoms could also have trouble socialising with friends and family, studying for an exam or preparing for work.

==Mechanism==

A number of possible mechanisms for overtraining have been proposed. One stipulates that microtrauma to the muscles are created faster than the body can heal them. Another proposes that amino acids are used up faster than they are supplied in the diet, a condition sometimes referred to as &quot;protein deficiency&quot;. Finally, systemic inflammation has been considered as a mechanism in which the release of cytokines activates an excessive immune response.

== Treatment ==

The most effective way to treat the effects of overtraining is to allow the body enough time to recover:
* Taking a break from training to allow time for recovery.
* Reducing volume and/or intensity of training.
* Suitable periodization of training.
* Splitting the training program so that different sets of muscles are worked on different days.
* Increase sleep time.
* Deep-tissue or sports massage of the affected muscles.
* Self-massage or rub down of the affected muscles.
* Short sprints with long resting time once the athlete is able to continue with light training.

=== Diet ===
Adapting nutritional intake can help to prevent and treat overtraining. Athletes in different fields will emphasize different proportional nutrition factors on the diet mainly including proteins, carbohydrates and fats. The diet includes a calorie intake that at least matches expenditure, ideally forming a suitable macronutrient ratio. During the recovery process, extra calories from diets may help the body speed the recovery. Finally, addressing vitamin deficiencies with improved diet and/or nutritional supplements has been proposed as a way to speed up recovery.

== Rhabdomyolysis ==
Exertional rhabdomyolysis is an extreme and potentially deadly form of overtraining that leads to a breakdown of skeletal muscle which makes its way into the blood. Many molecules such as potassium, creatine kinase, phosphate, and myoglobin are released into circulation. Myoglobin is the protein that causes the lethal reaction in the body. Early detection of the syndrome is essential in full recovery. A serious late complication of rhabdomyolysis which occurs in 15% of the population is acute kidney injury, and in some cases it can lead to death.

=== Clinical presentation ===

* Muscle pain
* Tenderness
* Swelling
* Weakness
* Bruising
* Tea colored urine
* Fever
* Malaise
* Nausea
* Emesis
* Confusion
* Agitation
* Delirium
* Anuria

=== CrossFit and rhabdomyolysis ===
As CrossFit has become more and more prevalent and popular, this has led to speculation that spikes in rhabdomyolysis cases are related to CrossFit. According to a study performed in the &quot;Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&quot;, unless performed incorrectly and in harmful environments, CrossFit presents no serious physical threat to the human body, and research into whether rhabdomyolysis cases and CrossFit are correlated is inconclusive.

== Prevention ==
Passive recovery, instead of active recovery, is a form of rest that is recommended to be performed by athletes in between rigorous, intermittent exercise. With active recovery, time to exhaustion is much shorter because the muscles are deoxygenated at a much quicker rate than with passive recovery. Thus, if avoiding overtraining means preventing exhaustion, passive recovery or &quot;static rest&quot; is safest. If active recovery is performed during intense exercise, an athlete may find themselves in a state of being overtrained. The gradual variation of intensity and volume of training is also an effective way to prevent overtraining.

<doc id="1228393" wikidata="Q3524720" url="?curid=1228393" title="Passive nuclear safety">
<text>Passive nuclear safety is a design approach for safety features, implemented in a nuclear reactor, that does not require any active intervention on the part of the operator or electrical/electronic feedback in order to bring the reactor to a safe shutdown state, in the event of a particular type of emergency (usually overheating resulting from a loss of coolant or loss of coolant flow). Such design features tend to rely on the engineering of components such that their predicted behaviour would slow down, rather than accelerate the deterioration of the reactor state; they typically take advantage of natural forces or phenomena such as gravity, buoyancy, pressure differences, conduction or natural heat convection to accomplish safety functions without requiring an active power source. Many older common reactor designs use passive safety systems to a limited extent, rather, relying on active safety systems such as diesel-powered motors. Some newer reactor designs feature more passive systems; the motivation being that they are highly reliable and reduce the cost associated with the installation and maintenance of systems that would otherwise require multiple trains of equipment and redundant safety class power supplies in order to achieve the same level of reliability. However, weak driving forces that power many passive safety features can pose significant challenges to effectiveness of a passive system, particularly in the short term following an accident.

==Terminology==
&#x27;Passive safety&#x27; describes any safety mechanism whose engagement requires little or no outside power or human control. Modern reactor designs have focused on increasing the number of passive systems to mitigate risk of compounding human error. 

Despite the increased safety associated with greater coverage by passive systems, all current large-scale nuclear reactors require both external (active) and internal (passive) systems. There are no &#x27;passively safe&#x27; reactors, only systems and components. Safety systems are used to maintain control of the plant if it goes outside normal conditions in case of anticipated operational occurrences or accidents, while the control systems are used to operate the plant under normal conditions. Sometimes a system combines both features. Passive safety refers to safety system components, whereas inherent safety refers to control system process regardless of the presence or absence of safety-specific subsystems.

An example of a safety system with passive safety components is the containment vessel of a nuclear reactor. The concrete walls and the steel liner of the vessel exhibit passive safety, but require active systems (valves, feedback loops, external instrumentation, control circuits, etc.) which require external power and human operation to function.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) classifies the degree of &quot;passive safety&quot; of components from category A to D depending on what the system does not make use of:
#no moving working fluid
#no moving mechanical part
#no signal inputs of &#x27;intelligence&#x27;
#no external power input or forces

In category A (1+2+3+4) is the fuel cladding, the protective and nonreactive outer layer of the fuel pellet, which uses none of the above features: It is always closed and keeps the fuel and the fission products inside and is not open before arriving at the reprocessing plant. In category B (2+3+4) is the surge line, which connects the hot leg with the pressurizer and helps to control the pressure in the primary loop of a PWR and uses a moving working fluid when fulfilling its mission. In category C (3+4) is the accumulator, which does not need signal input of &#x27;intelligence&#x27; or external power. Once the pressure in the primary circuit drops below the set point of the spring-loaded accumulator valves, the valves open and water is injected into the primary circuit by compressed nitrogen. In category D (4 only) is the SCRAM which utilizes moving working fluids, moving mechanical parts and signal inputs of &#x27;intelligence&#x27; but not external power or forces: the control rods drop driven by gravity once they have been released from their magnetic clamp. But nuclear safety engineering is never that simple: Once released the rod may not fulfil its mission: It may get stuck due to earthquake conditions or due to deformed core structures. This shows that though it is a passively safe system and has been properly actuated, it may not fulfil its mission. Nuclear engineers have taken this into consideration: Typically only a part of the rods dropped are necessary to shut down the reactor. Samples of safety systems with passive safety components can be found in almost all nuclear power stations: the containment, hydro-accumulators in PWRs or pressure suppression systems in BWRs.

In most texts on &#x27;passively safe&#x27; components in next generation reactors, the key issue is that no pumps are needed to fulfil the mission of a safety system and that all active components (generally I&amp;C and valves) of the systems work with the electric power from batteries.

IAEA explicitly uses the following caveat:
Nuclear reactor response properties such as Temperature coefficient of reactivity and Void coefficient of reactivity usually refer to the thermodynamic and phase-change response of the neutron moderator heat transfer &quot;process&quot; respectively. Reactors whose heat transfer process has the operational property of a negative void coefficient of reactivity are said to possess an &quot;inherent safety&quot; process feature. An operational failure mode could potentially alter the process to render such a reactor unsafe.

Reactors could be fitted with a hydraulic safety system component that increases the inflow pressure of coolant (esp. water) in response to increased outflow pressure of the moderator and coolant without control system intervention. Such reactors would be described as fitted with such a &quot;passive safety&quot; component that could – if so designed – render in a reactor a negative void coefficient of reactivity, regardless of the operational property of the reactor in which it is fitted. The feature would only work if it responded faster than an emerging (steam) void and the reactor components could sustain the increased coolant pressure. A reactor fitted with both safety features – if designed to constructively interact – is an example of a safety interlock. Rarer operational failure modes could render both such safety features useless and detract from the overall relative safety of the reactor.

== Examples of passive safety in operation ==
Traditional reactor safety systems are &quot;active&quot; in the sense that they involve electrical or mechanical operation on command systems (e.g., high-pressure water pumps). But some engineered reactor systems operate entirely passively, e.g., using pressure relief valves to manage overpressure. Parallel redundant systems are still required. Combined &quot;inherent&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; safety depends only on physical phenomena such as pressure differentials, convection, gravity or the &quot;natural&quot; response of materials to high temperatures to slow or shut down the reaction, not on the functioning of engineered components such as high-pressure water pumps.

Current pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors are systems that have been designed with one kind of passive safety feature. In the event of an excessive-power condition, as the water in the nuclear reactor core boils, pockets of steam are formed. These steam voids moderate fewer neutrons, causing the power level inside the reactor to lower. The BORAX experiments and the SL-1 meltdown accident proved this principle.

A reactor design whose &quot;inherently&quot; safe process directly provides a &quot;passive&quot; safety component during a specific failure condition in &quot;all&quot; operational modes is typically described as relatively fail-safe to that failure condition. However most current water-cooled and -moderated reactors, when scrammed, can not remove residual production and decay heat without either process heat transfer or the active cooling system. In other words, whilst the inherently safe heat transfer process provides a passive safety component preventing excessive heat while the reactor is operating, the same inherently safe heat transfer process &quot;does not&quot; provide a passive safety component if the reactor is shut down (SCRAMed). The Three Mile Island accident exposed this design deficiency: the reactor and steam generator were shut down but with loss of coolant it still suffered a partial meltdown.

Third generation designs improve on early designs by incorporating passive or inherent safety features which require &quot;no&quot; active controls or (human) operational intervention to avoid accidents in the event of malfunction, and may rely on pressure differentials, gravity, natural convection, or the natural response of materials to high temperatures.

In some designs the core of a fast breeder reactor is immersed into a pool of liquid metal. If the reactor overheats, thermal expansion of the metallic fuel and cladding causes more neutrons to escape the core, and the nuclear chain reaction can no longer be sustained. The large mass of liquid metal also acts as a heatsink capable of absorbing the decay heat from the core, even if the normal cooling systems would fail.

The pebble bed reactor is an example of a reactor exhibiting an inherently safe process that is also capable of providing a passive safety component for all operational modes. As the temperature of the &quot;fuel&quot; rises, Doppler broadening increases the probability that neutrons are captured by U-238 atoms. This reduces the chance that the neutrons are captured by U-235 atoms and initiate fission, thus reducing the reactor&#x27;s power output and placing an inherent upper limit on the temperature of the fuel. The geometry and design of the fuel pebbles provides an important passive safety component.

Single fluid fluoride molten salt reactors feature fissile, fertile and actinide radioisotopes in molecular bonds with the fluoride coolant. The molecular bonds provide a passive safety feature in that a loss-of-coolant event corresponds with a loss-of-fuel event. The molten fluoride fuel can not itself reach criticality but only reaches criticality by the addition of a neutron reflector such as pyrolytic graphite. The higher density of the fuel along with additional lower density FLiBe fluoride coolant without fuel provides a flotation layer passive safety component in which lower density graphite that breaks off control rods or an immersion matrix during mechanical failure does not induce criticality. Gravity driven drainage of reactor liquids provides a passive safety component.

Low power swimming pool reactors such as the SLOWPOKE and TRIGA have been licensed for &quot;unattended&quot; operation in research environments because as the temperature of the low-enriched (19.75% U-235) uranium alloy hydride fuel rises, the molecular bound hydrogen in the fuel cause the heat to be transferred to the fission neutrons as they are ejected. This Doppler shifting or spectrum hardening dissipates heat from the fuel more rapidly throughout the pool the higher the fuel temperature increases ensuring rapid cooling of fuel whilst maintaining a much lower water temperature than the fuel. Prompt, self-dispersing, high efficiency hydrogen-neutron heat transfer rather than inefficient radionuclide-water heat transfer ensures the fuel cannot melt through accident alone. In uranium-zirconium alloy hydride variants, the fuel itself is also chemically corrosion resistant ensuring a sustainable safety performance of the fuel molecules throughout their lifetime. A large expanse of water and the concrete surround provided by the pool for high energy neutrons to penetrate ensures the process has a high degree of intrinsic safety. The core is visible through the pool and verification measurements can be made directly on the core fuel elements facilitating total surveillance and providing nuclear non-proliferation safety. Both the fuel molecules themselves and the open expanse of the pool are passive safety components. Quality implementations of these designs are arguably the safest nuclear reactors.

==Examples of reactors using passive safety features==

Three Mile Island Unit 2 was unable to contain about 480 PBq of radioactive noble gases from release into the environment and around 120 kL of radioactive contaminated cooling water from release beyond the containment into a neighbouring building. The pilot-operated relief valve at TMI-2 was designed to shut automatically after relieving excessive pressure inside the reactor into a quench tank. However the valve mechanically failed causing the PORV quench tank to fill, and the relief diaphragm to eventually rupture into the containment building. The containment building sump pumps automatically pumped the contaminated water outside the containment building. Both a working PORV with quench tank and separately the containment building with sump provided two layers of passive safety. An unreliable PORV negated its designed passive safety. The plant design featured only a single open/close indicator based on the status of its solenoid actuator, instead of a separate indicator of the PORV&#x27;s actual position. This rendered the mechanical reliability of the PORV indeterminate directly, and therefore its passive safety status indeterminate. The automatic sump pumps and/or insufficient containment sump capacity negated the containment building designed passive safety.

The notorious RBMK graphite moderated, water-cooled reactors of Chernobyl Power Plant disaster were designed with a positive void coefficient with boron control rods on electromagnetic grapples for reaction speed control. To the degree that the control systems were reliable, this &quot;design&quot; did have a corresponding degree of &quot;active&quot; inherent safety. The reactor was unsafe at low power levels because erroneous control rod movement would have a counter-intuitively magnified effect. Chernobyl Reactor 4 was built instead with manual crane driven boron control rods that were tipped with the moderator substance, graphite, a neutron reflector. It was designed with an Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) that depended on either grid power or the backup Diesel generator to be operating. The ECCS safety component was decidedly not passive. The design featured a partial containment consisting of a concrete slab above and below the reactor – with pipes and rods penetrating, an inert gas filled metal vessel to keep oxygen away from the water-cooled hot graphite, a fire-proof roof, and the pipes below the vessel sealed in secondary water filled boxes. The roof, metal vessel, concrete slabs and water boxes are examples of passive safety components. The roof in the Chernobyl Power Plant complex was made of bitumen – against design – rendering it ignitable. Unlike the Three Mile Island accident, neither the concrete slabs nor the metal vessel could contain a steam, graphite and oxygen driven hydrogen explosion. The water boxes could not sustain high pressure failure of the pipes. The passive safety components as designed were inadequate to fulfill the safety requirements of the system.

The General Electric Company ESBWR (Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor, a BWR) is a design reported to use passive safety components. In the event of coolant loss, no operator action is required for three days.

The Westinghouse AP1000 (&quot;AP&quot; standing for &quot;Advanced Passive&quot;) uses passive safety components. In the event of an accident, no operator action is required for 72 hours. Recent versions of the Russian VVER have added a passive heat removal system to the existing active systems, utilising a cooling system and water tanks built on top of the containment dome.

The integral fast reactor was a fast breeder reactor run by the Argonne National Laboratory. It was a sodium cooled reactor capable of withstanding a loss of (coolant) flow without SCRAM and loss of heatsink without SCRAM. This was demonstrated throughout a series of safety tests in which the reactor successfully shut down without operator intervention. The project was canceled due to proliferation concerns before it could be copied elsewhere.

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was a molten salt reactor run by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It was nuclear graphite moderated and the coolant salt used was FLiBe, which also carried the uranium-233 fluoride fuel dissolved in it. The MSRE had a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity: as the FLiBe temperature increased, it expanded, along with the uranium ions it carried; this decreased density resulted in a reduction of fissile material in the core, which decreased the rate of fission. With less heat input, the net result was that the reactor would cool. Extending from the bottom of the reactor core was a pipe that lead to passively cooled drain tanks. The pipe had a &quot;freeze valve&quot; along its length, in which the molten salt was actively cooled to a solid plug by a fan blowing air over the pipe. If the reactor vessel developed excessive heat or lost electric power to the air cooling, the plug would melt; the FLiBe would be pulled out of the reactor core by gravity into dump tanks, and criticality would cease as the salt lost contact with the graphite moderator.

The General Atomics HTGR design features a fully passive and inherently safe decay heat removal system, termed the Reactor Cavity Cooling System (RCCS). In this design, an array of steel ducts line the concrete containment (and hence surround the reactor pressure vessel) which provide a flow path for air driven natural circulation from chimneys positioned above grade. Derivatives of this RCCS concept (with either air or water as the working fluid) has also been featured in other gas-cooled reactor designs, including the Japanese High-temperature engineering test reactor, the Chinese HTR-10, the South African PBMR, and the Russian GT-MHR. While none of these designs have been commercialized for power generation research in these areas is active, specifically in support of the Generation IV initiative and NGNP programs, with experimental facilities at Argonne National Laboratory (home to the Natural convection Shutdown heat removal Test Facility, a 1/2 scale air-cooled RCCS) and the University of Wisconsin (home to separate 1/4 scale air and water-cooled RCCS).

<doc id="1228394" wikidata="Q1398887" url="?curid=1228394" title="Hassan Pakravan">
<text>Hassan Pakravan (4 August 1911 – 11 April 1979) was a well-known diplomat and minister in the Pahlavi pre-revolutionary government of Iran. He is not only notable for his political involvement with the Mohammad Reza Pahlavi government and SAVAK, but also his relationship with Ruhollah Khomeini.

==Early life and education==
Hassan Pakravan, son of Fathollah and Amineh, was born in Tehran on 4 August 1911 (13 Mordad 1290 AP). His father held many high government posts, including governor of Khorasan province and ambassador to Italy. His mother, partly of European descent, was a professor at the University of Tehran. She was awarded the prestigious French Prix Rivarol, which the French government gives to foreign authors who write directly in French. She was related to the Habsburg rulers of the Austro-Hungarian empire.

As a child, Pakravan accompanied his parents to Cairo, where his father was appointed diplomatic agent. There, he received his primary education at the Lycée Français. He was then sent to Liège, Belgium where he attended high school and university. Pakravan then studied at the artillery school in Poitiers, France, and the Ecole d’Application d’Artillerie in Fontainebleau.

==Career==
In the 1940-1970s, Hassan Pakravan held many politically important, military and diplomatic posts, among them:
* military attaché in Pakistan (1949–1950);
* chief of army intelligence (1951–1953);
* military attaché in India (1954–1957);
* deputy chief of the State Intelligence and Security Organization in charge of external affairs (1957–1961);
* deputy prime minister and chief of SAVAK (1961–1965);
* minister of information (1965–1966);
* ambassador to Pakistan (1966–1969);
* ambassador to France (1969–1973);
* senior counselor to the Ministry of Court (1974–1979).

Pakravan was known for being more compassionate than any of National Security and Information Department&#x27;s other directors. However, Muhammad Reza Shah replaced Pakravan with his childhood friend Nematollah Nassiri in 1965. He returned to Iran in 1976 and was brought out of retirement in 1978 by the Shah in a last-ditch effort to curb corruption at the Royal Court. Pakravan&#x27;s supporters noted his aristocratic and impeccable character as well as his intelligence and moral courage to be a source of consolation at the difficult times of 1978–79 when the Iranian revolution took control of the opposition and eventually seized power.

==Head of SAVAK==
One of his first decisions as head of SAVAK was to refrain from any form of torture during interrogations.

===Relationship with Ayatollah Khomeini===

One of the more fascinating segments of the memoirs of General Pakravan&#x27;s wife is the description of her husband&#x27;s weekly luncheons with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1963, when the Ayatollah was under house arrest.

According to General Pakravan, &quot;The ayatollah used to say in this very flowery Eastern way, &#x27;Timsar [General], I count the days until we reach the day of our luncheon.&#x27;&quot; He described the ayatollah as, very handsome, someone with extraordinary presence, a power of seduction and great charisma. They talked about religion, philosophy, and history. General Pakravan also found him to be very ambitious and secretive. &quot;So much so that it made my hair stand on end. It was frightening,&quot; he told his wife.

Mrs. Pakravan confirms the well-known story that her husband saved Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s life in 1963. He was condemned to death and General Pakravan was upset by that. Pakravan felt that Khomeini&#x27;s execution would anger the common people of Iran. He knew that the population of the country was not its elite. He presented his argument to the shah. Once he had convinced the shah to allow him to find a way out, he called on Ayatollah Mohammad-Kazem Shariatmadari, one of the senior religious leaders of Iran, and asked for his help. Ayatollah Shariatmadari suggested that Khomeini be made a grand ayatollah. So, they made a religious decree which was taken by General Pakravan and Seyyed Jalal Tehrani to the Shah.

==Arrest and death==
After the Iranian revolution, Pakravan was among the first of the Shah&#x27;s officials to be executed. He was not allowed to have access to a lawyer and the charges filed against him were vague. Given the fact that he was retired at the time of the revolution, his execution seemed all the more unjust. Pakravan was a key player in convincing the Shah to commute the death sentence on Khomeini in 1963 and instead sending him to exile. Khomeini was first sent to Turkey, and then to Iraq, where he stayed until his expulsion and relocation to France in 1978.

In her memoirs, Mrs. Pakravan provides the description of the arrest, imprisonment, and execution of her husband by the Islamic Revolutionary Court. She argues that General Pakravan was taken from his house to an unknown destination. When his son tried to contact him, he was told that the general was not arrested at all but that he was the guest of the Ayatollah. But in fact he was imprisoned shortly after his arrest.

After his death sentence was read in mid-April 1979 Pakravan told the judges that he had accepted all the responsibilities then, and he accepted them now.

<text>The Nashville Zoo at Grassmere is a zoological garden and historic plantation farmhouse located southeast of Downtown Nashville. the zoo was middle Tennessee&#x27;s top paid attraction and contained 3,736 individual animals, encompassing 352 species. The zoo&#x27;s site is approximately in size and is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The zoo has around 1.2 million visitors a year.

==History==
===Dunn farm===
Nashville Zoo is located on property that was once a 300-acre slaveholding farm owned by Michael and Elizabeth Dunn. The Dunn&#x27;s original home, built in 1810 through slave labor, is still located on the property. Margaret and Elise Croft, the great-great granddaughters of Michael Dunn, the original owner, were the last of the family to live at this location. In 1989, archaeologists evaluating the property for its archaeological resources discovered an unmarked cemetery fairly close to Grassmere&#x27;s entrance off of Nolensville Road. When construction for the zoo began in 1997, this graveyard was not disturbed. It was only in 2013 when a newer entry plaza was planned did the zoo petition to have the bodies exhumed and their remains moved closer to the historic Dunn house by the state archaeologist. This exhumation revealed 9 to 30 African-Americans who had been buried there.

===Grassmere Wildlife Park===
The Croft sisters deeded the land and family home to the Children&#x27;s Museum of Nashville in 1964, with the agreement the house would remain and the land would be used as a &#x27;nature study center.&#x27; After Elise&#x27;s death in 1985, the museum began work on this nature study center, calling it &quot;Grassmere Wildlife Park&quot;.

===Nashville Zoo===
In December 1994, Grassmere Wildlife Park closed. The city of Nashville took over ownership of the property in 1995 and began searching for an independent organization to manage the property. Meanwhile, the Nashville Zoo had opened as a separate, privately owned facility in Joelton, Tennessee, in May 1991. In June 1996, then-Nashville Mayor Phil Bredesen proposed that either the Nashville Zoo be relocated from its Joelton location to Grassmere, or Grassmere be converted to a city park without animals. In October 1996, the Nashville City Council approved the terms of a lease agreement for Nashville Zoo to relocate to Grassmere.

The Nashville Zoo remained open in Joelton. In May 1997, the Nashville Wildlife Park at Grassmere opened. Both the Zoo and the wildlife park remained open, but due to public confusion, the Zoo closed their Joelton site in October 1998 and focused completely on the Grassmere location.

==Conservation==
In 2019, the Nashville Zoo supported nearly 50 conservation programs. These efforts include coral rescue, combatting wildlife trafficking, and preserving endangered or threatened species both locally and globally, including the hellbender, cheetah, loggerhead shrike, alligator snapping turtle, streamside salamander, oilbird, flamingo, and Nashville crayfish.

<text>George Richard Follmer (born January 27, 1934) is an American former auto racing driver, and one of the most successful road racers of the 1970s. He was born in Phoenix, Arizona. His family moved to California when he was just an infant.

==Career==
Follmer began his career running a Volkswagen Beetle in Gymkhana competition in parking lots in the San Gabriel Valley of Southern California.

Follmer raced in the USAC Championship Car series in the 1967-1971 and 1974 seasons, with 25 career starts, including the 1969-1971 Indianapolis 500 races. He finished in the top ten 11 times, with his one victory in 1969 at Phoenix International Raceway. His best finish at the Indianapolis 500 was in 1971. He started 29th and finished in the 15th position driving the Grant King Racer&#x27;s turbo Offy.

In 1973, Follmer competed in Formula One with Don Nichols&#x27; UOP Shadow team. He took part in his first Grand Prix, in South Africa, at the age of 39 years and 1 month - making him F1&#x27;s oldest débutant since the 1950s, a distinction he still holds. In 13 Championship races, his best results were 6th in South Africa and a podium 3rd in Spain, in his first two Grands Prix, which gave him 13th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with five points. He also competed in several non-Championship races.
Follmer also had success in other racing series. In 1965, he won the SCCA United States Road Racing Championship. Follmer won two races in the 1970 SCCA Continental Championship for Formula A cars, placing sixth in the standings. He won the Trans-Am championship in 1972, winning four races with an AMC Javelin, and 1976, driving a Porsche 934 Turbo.

In 1972, Follmer was the Can-Am champion, substituting for the injured Mark Donohue in Penske Racing&#x27;s Porsche 917/10, causing the racing press to dub Follmer &quot;George Am&quot;. He was vice-champion in 1973 driving for Rinzler and 1974 in a Shadow. He collected 6 wins and 13 podiums in the three-year spell. He is the only driver to win the Can-Am and Trans-Am championship in the same year.

Follmer competed in the NASCAR Winston Cup series in 1974, with appearances in 13 of 30 races. He collected three top 5 finishes and a pole position. In 1974 and 1975, he raced at the International Race of Champions, where he won a race.

In 1977 he returned to the revived Can-Am, resulting 6th in 1977 and 5th in 1978. He won the 1978 St. Jovite Can Am in his Prophet-Chevy over Alan Jones.

After his retirement, he came back to racing for the 1986 24 Hours of Le Mans, obtaining a prestigious third place with a Porsche 956.

Though long-retired from professional motorsports competition, Follmer still competes in vintage races, often driving the very same cars in which he competed during his heyday.

In addition to his racing career, Follmer also owned a Porsche-Audi-Subaru dealership in Pomona, California, later relocated to Montclair, California, from 1977 to 1990.

<text>Georges Berger (14 September 1918 – 23 August 1967) was a racing driver who raced a Gordini in his two World Championship Formula One Grands Prix.

He initially competed during the 1950s in a Formula 2 BMW-engined Jicey with which he finished third in the Grand Prix des Frontières at Chimay. In 1953 he raced for the Simca-Gordini team and finished fifth at the same track. He entered the same car (a 1.5-litre 4 cylinder Gordini type 15) in the Belgian Grand Prix but retired after only three laps with engine failure. The following year he raced a Gordini with nothing more than a fourth position at Rouen. After this he faded from single-seater racing.

Later in his career he shared the winning Ferrari at the 1960 Tour de France automobile. He was killed racing a Porsche 911 in the 1967 84-hour Marathon de la Route at Nürburgring.

<doc id="1228400" wikidata="Q171768" url="?curid=1228400" title="Gérard Larrousse">
<text>Gérard Gilles Marie Armand Larrousse (born 23 May 1940) is a former sports car racing, rallying and Formula One driver from France. His greatest success as a driver was winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1973 and 1974, driving a Matra-Simca MS670. After the end of his career as racing car driver, he continued to be involved in Formula One as a team manager for Renault. He later founded and ran his own Formula One team, Larrousse, from 1987 to 1994.

==Racing career==
Born in Lyon, Larousse began his motorsport career in rallying before focusing on circuit racing. He won the French Rally Championship with an Alpine A110. His biggest successes in international rallies came in a Porsche 911. He won the Tour de Corse in 1969, and placed second at the Monte Carlo Rally in 1969, 1970 and 1972. On gravel, he achieved a sixth place at the 1970 RAC Rally.

In a team with Vic Elford in 1971, Larrousse won the 12 Hours of Sebring with a Porsche 917K and the 1000km Nürburgring in a Porsche 908/03. He would follow this with victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1973 and 1974 alongside Henri Pescarolo for Matra-Simca. He participated in two Grands Prix, debuting on 12 May 1974, but failed to any score championship points. He drove Brabham BT42s for Scuderia Finotto.

==Team management==
Following his sports car career, he moved into racing management, running the Elf Switzerland operation in the European Formula Two Championship. From there, Larrousse went on to run the original factory Renault Formula One team during its final days as a full-fledged factory team in 1984 and 1985.

Larrousse also shared ownership of an eponymous Formula One team with various partners, from 1987 to 1994. His team achieved limited success in F1, with a best finish of 6th in the Constructor&#x27;s Championship in . However the team struggled in following seasons and by , Larrousse was forced to run several pay-drivers to help make ends meet. Although plans were in place to participate in the season, a lack of funds meant that the team was forced to withdraw from Formula One.

<text>Rebecca Harms (born 7 December 1956) is a German politician who served as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 2004 until 2019. She is a member of the Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens, part of the European Green Party. From 2010 until 2016 she served as president of The Greens–European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament.

==Early life and education==
Harms was born into a traditional working-class household and grew up in a village near Uelzen in Lower Saxony. She finished school with the Abitur in 1975 and began her career with an apprenticeship in plant nursery and landscape gardening. During her apprenticeship years, she moved with like-minded friends to an abandoned farm in the nearby district of Lüchow-Dannenberg and joined a local organic farmers’ co-operative.

==Political career==
During the following years, Harms became active in the anti-nuclear movement and began to study at university. In 1984 employed her as an advisor after being elected to the European Parliament. She returned to her home in 1988 to work as a production manager at the Wendland Film Co-operative, producing, among other films, documentaries about the Gorleben protest movement.

From 1994 to 2004, Harms was a member of the Landtag of Lower Saxony. From 1998 she served as chairwoman of her party on the state level. She has since been a member of the &quot;Parteirat&quot;, the federal leadership body of Germany&#x27;s Green Party.

===Member of the European Parliament, 2004–2019===

In 2004, Harms was the top candidate of the Alliance 90/The Greens for the Elections to the European Parliament and in 2009 she was elected again for parliament. Ahead of the 2014 elections, she lost out against fellow German MEP Ska Keller to lead the European Greens’ campaign alongside José Bové; however, she eventually led the German Green Party in the election campaign.
In her first term in parliament, Harms was a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Between 2007 and 2009, she served as Vice Chairwoman of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change; she was part of the European Parliament&#x27;s delegations to the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali and the 2008 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poznań.

Harms led the Greens–European Free Alliance in the European Parliament from 2009, at first alongside Daniel Cohn-Bendit (2009–2014) and later Philippe Lamberts (2014–2016). In addition, she was a member of the Committee of Inquiry into Emission Measurements in the Automotive Sector (dealing with the Volkswagen emissions scandal) from 2016. From 2017 until 2019, she served as chairwoman of the delegation to the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, which deals with relations with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.

On the national level, Harms was a Green Party delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2004 and 2012.

In October 2016, Harms announced that she would resign from her position as co-chairwoman of the Greens–European Free Alliance. Since beginning of 2017, she is the chairwoman of the delegation to the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, and Member of the Conference of Delegation Chairs. She is member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) and the Delegation to the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Association Committee, as well as the delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee. As Substitute Member, she is on the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI). She also represented the European Parliament in the OSCE/ODIHR international observation mission for the 2019 Moldovan parliamentary election.

In July 2018, Harms announced that she would not stand in the 2019 European elections but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.

==Political positions==

===On nuclear energy===
Living in the Wendland region which became known nationwide for the Gorleben atomic waste site, Harms is a declared opponent of nuclear power. In 2006, she commissioned two UK scientists for an alternate report, entitled TORCH, to the disputed November 2005 IAEA report on the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. She has been an outspoken critic of EU funding for the experimental International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) fusion project, money that, in her view, would be better spent on research into renewable energy. After European Union leaders in 2011 decided that nuclear reactors across all 27 member nations should undergo safety tests in response to the continuing radiation leaks from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan, Harms criticized that the tests were &quot;designed to give the impression that there’s a new evaluation of the risks of nuclear power&quot; but instead are meant &quot;to win new acceptance for nuclear power.&quot;

===On NSA surveillance and Edward Snowden===
After German newsmagazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reported in 2013 that American intelligence agencies had monitored the offices of the European Union in New York and Washington, Harms called for a special committee to investigate the claims and the possible cancellation of existing agreements between the European Union and the United States concerning bank transaction information and airline passenger data.

===On Russia and Ukraine===
During the war against Ukraine, Harms – a longtime critic of Putin – made a number of statements supporting Ukraine and criticizing Moscow. In December 2013, she addressed the thousands of Ukrainians in Maidan Nezalezhnosti protesting the regime&#x27;s rejection of a pact with the European Union. In the context of European efforts to unify their political response to Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Harms claimed that “in the face of a new threat of war in Europe, EU states have indeed agreed on a joint strategy towards Russia.” In April 2015, Harms therefore sharply criticized Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece for threatening to break ranks on the EU sanctions against Russia over the Russo-Ukrainian war, calling his visit to President Vladimir Putin “clearly pro-Russian and anti-European.“

Harms was a member of the parliament&#x27;s monitoring mission during the Ukrainian parliamentary elections in 2014, led by Andrej Plenković.

On 25 September 2014 Harms, who had arrived in Moscow to witness the court trial against Nadiya Savchenko, was denied entrance to the Russian Federation and was announced as &quot;persona non grata&quot;. She was informed that her entrance to Russia could be qualified as a crime. In 2015, news media reported that Harms was indeed included in a Russian blacklist of prominent people from the European Union who are not allowed to enter the country.

When Finland announced plans in 2014 to build a nuclear reactor in cooperation with Russian firm Rosatom and on the condition that Finland maintains an energy partnership with Russia over the subsequent years, Harms described the decision as &quot;wrong&quot;. She insisted that &quot;with a Russian partner, it is even worse,&quot; as this was &quot;totally contrary to the EU&#x27;s energy security goals, which aim to cut the EU&#x27;s damaging dependency on Russian energy.&quot;

Harms is fundamentally supportive of the European Commission’s 2015 proposal for an Energy Union, but warned that while reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian energy imports &quot;we escape into the arms of Azerbaijan or Kazakhstan instead of the home-grown renewables sector.&quot;

Along with other senior MEPs from the European Parliament&#x27;s main groups – including Elmar Brok and Guy Verhofstadt –, Harms signed a 2016 letter to EU foreign relations chief Federica Mogherini in which they urge the EU to impose sanctions on Russian officials over the killing of anti-corruption activist Sergei Magnitsky.

<doc id="1228404" wikidata="Q60883" url="?curid=1228404" title="Gerhard Mitter">
<text>Gerhard Karl Mitter (30 August 1935 – 1 August 1969) was a German Formula One and sportscar driver.

==Early life and career==
Mitter was born in Schönlinde (Krásná Lípa) in Czechoslovakia, but his family was expelled from there, to Leonberg near Stuttgart.

After racing motorbikes, he switched to Formula Junior, becoming the best German driver with 40 victories. In addition, he sold two-stroke engines for FJ. In 1963, Mitter won the Formula Junior Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring.

==Formula One==

Mitter also participated in seven Grands Prix, debuting on 23 June 1963. He scored a total of three championship points in his home 1963 German Grand Prix with an old Porsche 718 from 1961. Impressed by this, Team Lotus gave him a chance in the following years.

==Sportscar driver==

In sportscar racing and hillclimbing for Porsche, he scored many wins, e.g. the 1966-1968 European Hillclimb Championships against Ferrari, the 1966 24 Hours of Daytona (Porsche 907, in class) and the 1969 Targa Florio (Porsche 908) as his final major win.

==Return to Formula One and death==

Due to the long Nürburgring track, it was possible to take part in the German Grand Prix with Formula 2 cars that were classified in their own contest. Mitter was killed there at &quot;Schwedenkreuz&quot; while practising for the 1969 German Grand Prix with BMW&#x27;s &quot;269&quot; F2 project. As a suspension or steering failure was suspected, the BMW team with Hubert Hahne and Dieter Quester withdrew from the race, as did Mitter&#x27;s teammate at Porsche, Hans Herrmann. Udo Schütz, his driving partner at Porsche in the 1969 World Sportscar Championship season with whom he had won the Targa three months earlier, had survived a bad crash at the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans, and retired.

<text>The Memphis Zoo is a zoo in Midtown, Memphis, Tennessee, United States. There are no Tennessee Tuesdays in March at the Memphis Zoo. It is home to more than 3,500 animals representing over 500 different species. Created in April 1906, the zoo has been a major tenant of Overton Park for more than 100 years. The land currently designated to the Memphis Zoo was defined by the Overton Park master plan in 1888, it is owned by the City of Memphis. The zoo is set on , of which approximately are developed.

In 2008, the Memphis Zoo was ranked &quot;#1 Zoo in the U.S.&quot; by TripAdvisor. The ranking was based on visitor opinions.

Since the early 1990s, the Memphis Zoo has invested over $77 million for renovation and expansion. The zoo&#x27;s animal inhabitants reside in three zones with 19 exhibits, such as &quot;Teton Trek&quot;, &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; and &quot;China.&quot;

The Memphis Zoo is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).

== History ==
===Early 1900s===
The zoo was established on April 4, 1906, with $1,200 from the Memphis Park Commission. In August 1906, 23 cages and concrete bear enclosures were built with another $3,628 thanks to the head of the commission, Col. Robert Galloway.

Galloway Hall, the Memphis Zoo&#x27;s first building, was finished in 1907. It was named in honor of Col. Galloway, but was later demolished to make room for newer exhibits.

The Carnivora Building was constructed in 1909 to house the first cats at the zoo. It was later replaced by &quot;Cat Country&quot;, and converted into an inner-zoo restaurant.

The Elephant House opened in 1910. The building is still used as the main building of the zoo&#x27;s educational department, but the elephants were moved to the &quot;African Veldt&quot; exhibit.

In 1916, the Botanical Display Building opened. It was later converted into the Tropical Bird House.

The Memphis Zoo acquired a round barn from the Memphis Police Department in 1923, who used the building as their stable for the mounted horse patrol in the early 1900s. The zoo&#x27;s round barn exhibit is a collection of exotic hoofstock and birds.

In 1936, the zoo&#x27;s first primate exhibit, &quot;Monkey Island&quot;, was built. It was replaced in 1995 by &quot;Primate Canyon&quot;.

===Mid-1900s===

The &quot;Aquarium&quot; was completed in 1959. It is one of the oldest exhibits at the Memphis Zoo. The building houses aquatic life from both fresh and salt water environments. In 1979, it had major renovations.

The &quot;Herpetarium&quot; was constructed in 1960, located across from the Tropical Bird House. The Herpetarium is home to the zoo&#x27;s snakes, alligators, lizards and frogs. Later in the year, the Pachyderm/Elephant exhibit was finished, and the elephants moved in from the old elephant house.

===Late 1900s to present===

The zoo renovated its entrance in 1990. The main entrance way was designed by architect, Jeffery Borchardt. It was dubbed as the &quot;Avenue of the Animals&quot; which displays a grand Egyptian motif modeled after the Avenue of Sphinxes in Egypt. The zoo portal facade features a 40&#x27; by 163&#x27; wall with hieroglyphics of all the animals in the zoo. In the top panels, the Memphis Zoo Mission Statement is written in hieroglyphics.


&quot;Cat Country&quot;, a , open-air exhibit focused on both predators and prey of the cat world, opened in 1993. Tigers and lions share common space with fennec foxes and meerkats. An Education Complex, Discovery Center, and the Elephant&#x27;s Trunk Zoo Shop also opened at this time. The Carnivora Building that formerly housed the zoo&#x27;s large cats was remodeled into The Cat House Cafe, which opened in 1994.

Three new exhibits opened in 1995. &quot;Animals of the Night&quot; is devoted to nocturnal animals, and reverses their hours from normal so visitors can see them at their most active. &quot;Once Upon A Farm&quot; was built to resemble an early 1900s farm. &quot;Primate Canyon&quot; features naturalistic, outdoor exhibit areas for a variety of monkeys and apes.

&quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; was opened in 1998 for the zoo&#x27;s three Komodo dragons, and includes outdoor and indoor areas, allowing them to stay warm during the cool winter months. A new animal hospital was also finished in 1998, with separate holding and quarantine wings built on opposite ends of the building. The sick wing separates sick or injured animals from others and allows for proper recovery time. The quarantine wing is used for newly acquired animals, which are quarantined for at least 30 days upon arrival at the zoo before being introduced to their new homes. On September 18, 1998, two plaques were dedicated in memory of musician Jeff Buckley in the Memphis Zoo&#x27;s Sumatran tiger exhibit. His mother chose that location because of his great love of the Memphis Zoo and the tigers in particular. Jeff frequently visited the zoo, had plans to become a volunteer in 1997 and, according to his mother, never left the zoo without visiting the &quot;Butterflies: In Living Color&quot; exhibit, which also opened early in 1998. The exhibit was replaced by &quot;Birds and Bees&quot; in late May 2009.

In April 2003, the Memphis Zoo became one of only four U.S. zoos to exhibit the giant panda as a part of a 20-year loan. One male and one female giant panda (&quot;Ya Ya&quot; and &quot;Le Le&quot;) share their home with several other species native to China, in the first Memphis Zoo exhibit to be built as zoogeographical exhibit. The buildings, plant life and even the sounds of China are represented in this $16 million exhibit. In February 2023, a few months before the Pandas were set to be returned to China, Le Le passed away leading to concerns about the treatment the pandas were getting in the Zoo. In May 2023, Ya Ya was successfully sent back to China after the end of the loan agreement.
The &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; exhibit opened on March 1, 2006, with underwater viewing for polar bears and sea lions. The animals frequently interact with visitors, and the sea lions are fond of following and mimicking small children.

&quot;Butterflies: In Living Color!&quot; was renovated in 2007. The exhibit housed as many as 1,000 butterflies of 35 different species. There were 56 varieties of plants for the butterflies to feed on.

Construction of the &quot;Teton Trek&quot; exhibit started in February 2008. The decision to clearcut of old growth forest in the Old Forest Arboretum in order to build the exhibit drew sustained criticism by Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, which was reorganized in response to the forest reduction, and by Park Friends, Inc. Approximately 14 acres of forest adjacent to the zoo were left out of the protective area to ease opposition from former Memphis Mayor A C Wharton and zoo officials.

The zoo had its largest single day attendance ever on March 17, 2009, with more than 20,450 visitors. In late May 2009, the &quot;Birds and Bees&quot; exhibit opened in the former butterfly exhibit. The butterfly garden moved outside the aviary, and is still close to the original exhibit. Longtime zoo favorite &quot;Ann&quot; the reticulated python died on July 28, 2009. She was 18 years old. &quot;Teton Trek&quot; was opened on October 10, 2009, and winning artists of the Teton Trek Art Contest were recognized.

The zoo&#x27;s second African exhibit, &quot;Zambezi River Hippo Camp&quot;, opened to the public on April 29, 2016.

==Exhibits==

The zoo hosts modern exhibits that mimic the animals&#x27; natural habitats, such as &quot;Once Upon A Farm&quot;, &quot;Cat Country&quot;, &quot;Primate Canyon&quot;, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;, &quot;Animals of the Night&quot;, &quot;Tropical Bird House&quot;, &quot;Herpetarium&quot;, &quot;Aquarium&quot;, &quot;African Veldt&quot;, &quot;Zambezi River Hippo Camp&quot;, &quot;China&quot;, &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;, and &quot;Teton Trek&quot;. Viewing all the exhibits requires a walk of about . Operating seasonally, trams provide visitors with guided tours of exhibits for a small daily fee; the trams are also useful for shuttling visitors between distant exhibits. Other attractions at the zoo include a carousel, an area with rides, a miniature train offering a scenic view of the &quot;Once Upon A Farm&quot; exhibit, and several theme-oriented gift shops and eateries; many of these amenities operate seasonally. A children&#x27;s playground is located next to the Cat House Cafe, and several family picnic areas are maintained beneath groves of mature trees. An ice skating rink is operated seasonally at the zoo; the tented rink has an area of 5,400 square feet for skating. Camel rides and giraffe feeding are offered from March to October 2012 for a fee.

The zoo is divided into three zones that showcase a total of 19 different exhibits.

===East zone===
====Teton Trek====
The exhibit, which opened October 2009, brings hallmark features of the Yellowstone National Park to the Memphis Zoo. &quot;Teton&quot; refers to the Teton Range in Wyoming. &quot;Teton Trek&quot; begins with a replica of the Old Faithful Geyser and a replica of the Old Faithful Inn called the Great Lodge, where interpretive information is presented in an interactive format. The exhibit is home to some of the keystone species of the Yellowstone ecosystem: grizzly bears, elk, timber wolves, trumpeter swans, a North American porcupine, black bears and sandhill cranes. The exhibit&#x27;s trail provides visitors with an underwater look at the bears&#x27; fishing pond and a prominent overlook atop the replica of Yellowstone&#x27;s Firehole Falls.

====Northwest Passage====
Home to the zoo&#x27;s polar bears, this $23 million exhibit opened on March 1, 2006, and features an underwater viewing building, sea lion observation bubble and a 500-seat amphitheater for daily sea lion shows. This exhibit&#x27;s theme is a tribute to the First Nations culture in Canada&#x27;s western province British Columbia, animals that inhabit the Pacific Northwest, and its horticulture. Messages of conservation inspired by Chief Seattle, a famous Native American chief, are sprinkled throughout the exhibit. Six hand-carved totem poles that stand throughout the area received a Native American blessing ceremony when they arrived at the zoo. The &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; is also home to the zoo&#x27;s American bald eagles, and white-necked ravens.

====African Veldt====
African elephants, white rhinos, and giraffe are joined by zebras, Grant&#x27;s gazelle, and ostriches in this area. African cranes, bontebok, lechwe, bongo and scimitar oryx also live here. The zoo finished enlarging the elephant exhibit in 2006; it now features a pool that allows elephants to submerse and bathe.

====World of Waterfowl====
In this exhibit, two wooden bridges take visitors through a wetland. It is home to around 30 Chilean flamingos and a variety of other waterfowl.

====Birds and Bees====
This exhibit opened in May 2009. It features an up-close look at two honey bee hives. Displays inside the exhibit explain what makes bees special and the role they play in agriculture. The indoor bee exhibit leads to an outdoor aviary that features approximately 500 budgies, commonly known as parakeets. In addition to viewing these colorful birds, visitors can feed them using millet seed-heads attached to sticks that are available for a small fee.

===Central zone===
====China====
Opened in April 2003, this $16 million exhibit is a zoogeographical area the Memphis Zoo constructed after it became one of only four U.S. zoos to exhibit the giant panda. Other animals showcased in this effort to preserve Chinese species include Sulawesi Black-crested macaques, Père David&#x27;s deer, Red pandas, François&#x27; langurs, and an assortment of colorful birds such as the golden pheasant and red-crowned crane.

====Primate Canyon====
This exhibit was opened in 1995 and features naturalistic, outdoor exhibit areas for western lowland gorillas, Sumatran orangutans and siamang gibbons. Other animals in the area are lion-tailed macaques, black-and-white ruffed lemurs, Mona monkeys, Sulawesi macaques, red ruffed lemurs, lesser spot-nosed monkeys, eastern black-and-white colobus, and savanna baboons.

The zoo employed cultural architecture native to the land of the species on exhibit (for example, temple ruins surround the Sumatran tiger exhibit). The old Carnivora Building, where the cats used to live, was renovated to become the Memphis Zoo&#x27;s primary restaurant – the Cat House Café.

====Zambezi River Hippo Camp====
This African exhibit opened in 2016. Its location is adjacent to the Primate Pavilion and south entrance to the African Veldt. It is home to hippos, Nile crocodiles, okapi, yellow-backed duikers, Cape vultures, taveta weavers, nyalas, mandrills, blue-bellied rollers, patas monkeys, Chilean and lesser flamingos.

Six bonobos (including a baby bonobo born in 2005) live in this indoor/outdoor hybrid exhibit across from the &quot;China&quot; exhibit. The bonobo is endangered and is found in the wild only in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

====Animals of the Night====
This exhibit reverses the daily cycle of nocturnal animals, giving visitors the chance to see night-dwellers at their most active. The exhibit is developed around a central bat flyway which enables visitors to get a close-up view of the bats in flight or feeding. Also exhibited are a wide range of other species—from aardvark to wombat.The exhibit also features the Bear cuscus which is featured in only 4 other zoos around the world.

===West zone===
====Dragon&#x27;s Lair====
This exhibit was specifically built for the Komodo dragon, the largest lizard in the world. The zoo&#x27;s three dragons share a special exhibit with outdoor and indoor areas allowing them to stay warm during the cool winter months. Keepers hold a feeding demonstration of the Komodo dragons on Saturdays. Currently, a visiting Komodo dragon from the St. Louis Zoo is visiting for breeding purposes (2013).

====Tropical Bird House====
A variety of colorful birds in outdoor enclosures can be seen by visitors at the entrance to the zoo&#x27;s Tropical Bird House. The building is home to exotic bird species from around the world such as the pygmy falcon, Burrowing owl, azure-winged magpie, Bali myna, crested coua, golden white-eye, Jambu fruit dove, Mariana fruit dove, plush-crested jay, purple-throated fruitcrow, red-billed hornbill, Tinian monarch, Toco toucan, and the white-tailed trogon. The exhibit features a walk-through aviary which allows visitors close contact to a number of birds, especially during feeding time.

====Aquarium====
The Aquarium is one of the oldest exhibits at the Memphis Zoo and houses aquatic life from both fresh and salt water environments. Some of the more notable animals include: Fly River turtles, electric eels, red bellied piranhas, archer fish, green moray eels, porcupine pufferfish, Arapaima and Volitan lionfish, The electric eel exhibit has a unique feature that converts the eel&#x27;s electric pulses into a sound and visual display.

====Penguin Rock====
Over 30 African penguins live across from the zoo&#x27;s rides area at Penguin Rock. American white pelicans are located nearby.

====Once Upon A Farm====
This exhibit was built to resemble an early 1900s farm. It is home to Caspian horses, domestic goats, prairie dogs, domestic chickens, Babydoll sheep, miniature cows, guinea pigs, Pekin ducks and miniature donkeys. In addition to farm animals, a vegetable garden, a cotton patch, and rows of corn provide visitors with some of the essential elements of a southern farm during the growing season.

====Herpetarium====
Located across from the Tropical Bird House, the herpetarium is home to the zoo&#x27;s snakes such as the Burmese python, American alligators, lizards such as the Prehensile-tailed skink, and frogs such as the azure poison dart frog, Bell&#x27;s horned frog, and milk frog. It includes the rare Louisiana pine snake and the axolotl, in addition to some of the most venomous snakes in the world, including the green mamba, Eastern diamondback rattlesnake, and Gaboon viper. It is home to an alligator snapping turtle and Galápagos tortoises. In a seasonal exhibit, a simulated shallow pond provides favorable breeding habitat for the highly endangered Mississippi gopher frog; this exhibit also features a slide presentation describing the zoo&#x27;s participation in the frog&#x27;s recovery program. The exhibit also includes a selection of Crocodiles which includes Dwarf crocodiles, West African slender-snouted crocodiles, and an American alligator.

====Round Barn====
The Round Barn is home to gerenuks, which are known by their extremely long necks. Keepers encourage their foraging behavior by placing tall bamboo stems in their exhibit. This exhibit also houses Abyssinian ground-hornbills, warthogs, red river hogs, Grey crowned crane, nyalas, yellow-backed duikers, dik diks, klipspringers, and dama gazelles.

==Other features==
===Landscaping===

Landscaping plays a key role in each of the zoo&#x27;s three zones, both within exhibits and along the interconnecting trails. Water features, such as ponds, waterfalls, fountains, and streams, are dominant elements of the overall design, in addition to artificial rock formations which blend into the containment walls of the animals&#x27; enclosures. Other key elements of the landscaping are a diverse mix of trees, shrubs, and seasonal herbaceous plants.

Most of the larger trees are native species, which include sweetgum, sycamore, tulip poplar and a host of different oaks and hickories. Common shrubs include colorful native species, such as American beautyberry, oakleaf hydrangea, southern bayberry, and witch hazel, plus numerous exotic shrubs selected for their individual merits. Some exhibits feature plants that support the exhibit&#x27;s theme, such as the Chinese fringetrees and Chinese snowball viburnums in the China Exhibit and several species of western conifers, maples, and birches in the Northwest Passage and Teton Trek Exhibits.

Several gardens are maintained within the zoo, where the plants are the featured items. In addition, tropical plants are grown in several areas during summer months; species include banana plants, elephant ears, hibiscuses, and oleanders growing above a groundcover of coleus and ornamental sweet potato.

===Events===
The Memphis Zoo sponsors a wide variety of special events with the overall theme—&quot;Always Something To Do&quot;. These include: Horticultural Tours (periodic), Plant Sale (April), Zoo Boo with its Haunted Forest (October), Zoo Lights with over 1 million holiday lights, Santa, live reindeer, and magic show (November/December), Zoo Rendezvous (September), Zoo Snooze (periodic), and many more. There are also a wide assortment of educational activities throughout the year for school-aged children.

===Magazine===
&quot;Exzoobrance&quot; is a bimonthly magazine published by the Memphis Zoological Society to keep patrons informed about zoo-related activities and information. Each edition includes a calendar of events, a description of special events, news about educational and conservation programs, information about the animals and their exhibits, and a kid&#x27;s activity page. Copies are archived online beginning in 2009.

==Incidents==

On January 8, 2008, a stray dog entered the Memphis Zoo through a service door and leapt into the tiger exhibit before officials could apprehend it. Zoo staff distracted the tigers, allowing the dog to walk out of the exhibit and survive with several injuries.

In May 2009, a zoo keeper was bitten by a Bengal tiger after failing to close two internal safety doors, allowing a tiger to enter an unsecured hallway. The tiger, named Kumari, was sedated and safely placed back in her exhibit.

In 2019, a man entering the Memphis Zoo shot himself in the upper thigh with a handgun hidden in his pocket. This incident brought attention to the zoo&#x27;s firearm policies and zoo officials stated that they would look into it.

==Future projects== 

The Memphis Zoo has a few projects in their future plans with funding efforts currently underway.

* A new major attraction, expected to be complete by the spring of 2022, is underway with plans to renovate the Hippo Barn Enclosure as well as other unannounced parts of the zoo. Many new jobs will be created from this project.
* An indoor coffee shop is expected to be built by summer 2021. Located near the front entrance of the zoo, it will sell coffee and pastries.

<text>&quot;Geki&quot; was the racing pseudonym of Giacomo Russo (23 October 1937 – 18 June 1967), who was a racing driver from Italy. An experienced driver in the Italian lower formulae, he also participated in three Formula One Italian Grands Prix from 1964 to 1966, failing to qualify for the 1964 race, driving a Brabham for Rob Walker. For his two Grand Prix starts, he drove for Team Lotus. He scored no championship points.

However, he was a four-time Italian Formula Three series champion, winning consecutive championships from 1961 to 1964.

He was killed in a horrific accident in an Italian Formula Three race at Caserta in 1967. After an accident involving Beat Fehr, Andrea Saltari and Franco Foresti, Fehr ran down the track to warn the oncoming racers of the damaged cars and oil on the track ahead. The next group of cars included Geki, Massimo Natili, Jürg Dubler, Romano &quot;Tiger&quot; Perdomi and Corrado Manfredini who were unable to avoid colliding with the wreckage on the track. Geki&#x27;s Matra then crashed into a wall and he was killed instantly. Fehr was struck by one of the cars and was also killed, and Perdomi died in hospital eight days later.

<text>Greenodd is a village in Westmorland and Furness, Cumbria, England, north-east of Ulverston. At the northern end of the Furness peninsula, it was historically part of Lancashire.

Greenodd sits within the civil parish of Egton with Newland at the junction of the A5092 and A590. Just outside the southern boundary of the Lake District national park, it is where the River Crake (fed by Coniston Water) flows into the River Leven (fed by Windermere), beginning the Leven Estuary.

==History==

The name &quot;Greenodd&quot; is of Scandinavian origin, the &quot;odd&quot; meaning &quot;ness&quot; (headland) in this case (the name translates literally as &#x27;The Green Promontory&#x27;). Swedish Eilert Ekwall speculated that the name was not an old one, as &#x27;odd&#x27; remained part of the Lancashire dialect until at least the early 20th century. In the late-18th and early-19th centuries Greenodd was a significant port; a creek-port of Lancaster. Exports included copper ore from Coniston, locally quarried limestone, and gunpowder from the nearby settlement of Backbarrow. Sugar, raw cotton and coal are listed in historical documents as some of the imports. Greenodd was also a shipbuilding centre with vessels up to 200 tons being constructed. On the darker side it is likely that Greenodd was involved in the North American slave trade. Today there are no signs of the former commercial activities. The &quot;Ship Inn&quot;, previously a warehouse on the quayside, is one of the few reminders of Greenodd&#x27;s illustrious past.

In 2008, Greenodd was involved in a battle to save its post office. The government announced in late 2006 that it would shutting 2,500 post offices nationwide, citing the rising losses and fewer number of people using them as the primary reasons. The inhabitants of Greenodd protested at the move, and even gained the support of the MP from the neighbouring constituency of Westmorland and Lonsdale, Tim Farron. Farron put his name to a petition which gained 6,800 signatures, but it was to no avail.

==Transport==

Until the 1980s, the A590, connecting Furness to much of the rest of the country, ran along the village&#x27;s narrow main street, causing traffic problems for the small village. These were alleviated by building a dual carriageway bypass to take the traffic over two new bridges across the River Crake. The south end of Main Street was stopped up, leaving the village effectively a cul-de-sac. 

Greenodd railway station was served by the Lakeside branch of the Furness Railway from 1869 until its closure in 1965. Today there is no trace of the railway, the station having been demolished to make way for a dual-carriageway road. Greenodd is now also on the W2W Cycle Route between Walney and Wearmouth.

<text>Ian Ewart Raby (22 September 1921 – 7 November 1967) was a British racing driver from England. He participated in 7 World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 20 July 1963 in the British Grand Prix, where he retired on Lap 60. He scored no championship points. He was a garage-owner in Brighton, Sussex trading as Empire Cars Ltd. As a privateer he came to Formula One late in life.

Raby started racing about 1953 and drove an assortment of cars, many with the name &quot;puddle jumper&quot; written on the side. He is remembered for the I.E.R. Midget F3 car of 1954. He won the 500 c.c. racing car class in a Cooper at the Brighton Speed Trials in 1955. Raby finished 15th in the 1957 24 Hours of Le Mans, sharing a Cooper-Climax T39 with Jack Brabham. He won the first Formula Junior race to be held in Britain, at Brands Hatch on 3 August 1959 driving the one-off Moorland car. On 12 June 1960 he won a heat and finished second overall in the Albi Grand Prix, France, for Formula Junior cars. Later that year he won a Formula Libre race at Mallory Park in a Cooper-Climax F2. On 9 May 1963 he took third place in the non-championship F1 Rome Grand Prix at Vallelunga in a Gilby-B.R.M. V8. At the Solitude Grand Prix he was still running at the end but not classified, and he retired in the Oulton Park Gold Cup.

He switched to a Brabham-B.R.M. for 1964 but the car often let him down, non-starting in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. He managed an eighth at Syracuse in the Brabham in 1965, selling the car prior to the Italian Grand Prix that year.

As Formula One switched to 3-litres for 1966 Ian Raby opted to race in Formula Two. An F2 Brabham-Ford Lotus twin-cam for 1967 produced an eighth place at Snetterton on 24 March. Another eighth place at Hockenheim in June only highlighted the lack of a &quot;de rigueur&quot; Cosworth FVA engine. Back at Hockenheim on 9 July, Raby managed fifth place against his more powerful rivals.

On 30 July 1967, Ian Raby crashed his Brabham in the Zandvoort Trophy (Grote Prijs van Zandvoort) F2 race and was seriously injured. He succumbed to his injuries on 7 November 1967.

<doc id="1228415" wikidata="Q424379" url="?curid=1228415" title="Akwesasne">
<text>The Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne ( ; ; ) is a Mohawk Nation (&quot;Kanienʼkehá:ka&quot;) territory that straddles the intersection of international (United States and Canada) borders and provincial (Ontario and Quebec) boundaries on both banks of the St. Lawrence River. Although divided by an international border, the residents consider themselves to be one community. They maintain separate police forces due to jurisdictional issues and national laws.

The community was founded in the mid-18th century by Mohawk families from Kahnawake (also known as Caughnawaga), a Catholic Mohawk village that developed south of Montreal along the St. Lawrence River. Today Akwesasne has a total of 12,000 residents, with the largest population and land area of any &quot;Kanienʼkehá:ka&quot; community. From its development in the mid-eighteenth century, Akwesasne was considered one of the Seven Nations of Canada. It is one of several &quot;Kanienʼkehá꞉ka&quot; (Mohawk), meaning &quot;people of the flint&quot; in Mohawk, territories within present-day Canada; others are Kahnawake, Wahta, Tyendinaga, Kanesatake, and the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation (which includes several subdivisions of Mohawk, the other five nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, and some other Native American tribes), founded after the American Revolutionary War.

With settlement of the border between Canada and the United States in the early 19th century, a larger portion of the territory was defined as being within the United States. The portion in New York state is known as the federally recognized St. Regis Mohawk Reservation. The portion in Ontario is referred to as Akwesasne Reserve No. 59 (), and the portions in Quebec as ().

The name &quot;Akwesasne&quot; in Mohawk means &quot;Land Where the Partridge Drums&quot;, referring to the rich wildlife in the area.

==Geography==
Akwesasne territory incorporates part of the St. Lawrence River, the mouths of the Raquette and St. Regis rivers, and a number of islands in these three rivers. The eastern border of the southern portion is formed by the St. Regis River. The territory is divided between north–south by the Canada–United States border. The northern portion is further divided by the Canadian provincial boundary between Ontario to the west and Quebec to the east.

The Three Nations Crossing connects Kawehno:ke (Cornwall Island, Ontario) to the City of Cornwall in the north and Rooseveltown, New York in the south.

Because of the St. Lawrence River to the north, New York State, United States, to the south, and the absence of a road link to the rest of Quebec, to the east, the Quebec portion of the Akwesasne reserve is a practical exclave claimed by Canada. To travel by land from Tsi Snaihne (Snye or Chenail, Quebec) or Kana:takon (Saint Regis, Quebec) to elsewhere in Canada, one must drive through New York State. In Canada, the territory within Ontario is called the Akwesasne 59 Indian Reserve, and the territory within Quebec is called the Akwesasne Indian Reserve.

In the U.S. state of New York, the territory of &quot;Akwesasne&quot; coincides with what is called the federally recognized St. Regis Mohawk Reservation. This portion of Akwesasne is bisected by New York State Route 37. This major state highway in the North Country of New York, extends for on an east–west axis.

==History==
Beginning about 1000 AD, nomadic indigenous people around the Great Lakes began adopting the cultivation of maize. By the 14th century, Iroquoian-speaking peoples, later called the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, had created fortified villages along the fertile valley of what is now called the St. Lawrence River. Among their villages were &quot;Stadacona&quot; and &quot;Hochelaga&quot;, visited in 1535–1536 by French explorer Jacques Cartier. While they shared certain culture with other Iroquoian groups, they were a distinctly separate people and spoke a branch of Iroquoian called Laurentian. But by the time Samuel de Champlain explored the same area 75 years later in the early 1600s, the villages had disappeared.

Historians theorize that the stronger Mohawk from the South waged war against the St. Lawrence Iroquoians to get control of the fur trade and hunting along the river valley. By 1600, the Mohawk used the valley for hunting grounds and as a path for war parties.

In the early 17th century, some Christian Iroquois (primarily Mohawk, but also some Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca) migrated from present-day New York to Kahnawake (formerly known as Caughnawaga, after their village along the Mohawk River), a Catholic mission village established by French Jesuits south of Montreal. Kahnawake is a &quot;Kanienʼkehá꞉ka&quot; (Mohawk) word meaning &quot;at the rapids&quot;. Here, additional First Nations joined the community, converting to Roman Catholicism; the Mohawk dominated in number. During the colonial years, this community participated in the fur trade. Some men regularly traveled to Albany, New York for better prices from the English and Dutch than the French were willing to give.

In addition, warriors and families became involved in raiding and the traffic in captives during Queen Anne&#x27;s War in the early 1700s between France and England. French and First Nations allies, including the Abenaki, would bring captives back to Kahnawake from New England settlements, often to be ransomed. Younger English children and women were sometimes adopted by Mohawk families and assimilated into the tribe.

Due to exhaustion of land at Kahnawake and problems with traders&#x27; rum at the village, in the mid-1750s about 30 families migrated upriver about 20 leagues to set up a new community. Among the leaders were brothers and chiefs John and Zachariah Tarbell. Father Pierre-Robert-Jean-Baptiste Billiard accompanied the migrants as their priest. French officials supported the move, paying for a sawmill at the new mission. With tensions rising prior to the Seven Years&#x27; War (also known in North America as the French and Indian War), the French wanted to keep the Mohawk as allies, and away from English influence.

The Tarbell brothers were born to English colonists in Groton, Massachusetts. They had been taken captive as children in 1707 along with their older sister Sarah, then 14, during Queen Anne&#x27;s War. John and Zachariah were 12 and 8, respectively. The three children were taken by the French and Abenaki raiders some 300 miles to Montreal. They all became Catholic and were renamed. Sarah/Marguerite was redeemed by a French couple and entered the Congregation of Notre Dame, a teaching order founded in Montreal by French women in 1653. Adopted by Mohawk families in Kahnawake, the two boys became thoroughly assimilated: learning the language and ways, and being given Mohawk names. They later each married daughters of chiefs and reared their children as Mohawk. They each became chiefs, and some of their sons also became chiefs. They were examples of the multi-cultural community of the Mohawk, who absorbed numerous captives into their tribe.

Starting in 1755, French-Canadian Jesuit priests founded the St. Regis Mission at Akwesasne. The Tarbell brothers were listed among the founding chiefs, representing numerous clans as of 1759, in papers of Loran Kanonsase Pyke, the patriarch of Akwesasne&#x27;s Pyke family.

The Jesuits first built a log and bark church at the mission, then a more formal log church. In 1795 the Mohawk completed construction of a stone church, which still stands. Named after the French priest St. Jean-François Regis, the mission was the source of the French name of the adjacent Saint Regis River, an island in the St. Lawrence River, and the nearby village. The church was long a landmark to ships on the river approaching the rapids. In New York, the name was later adopted to apply to the Saint Regis Mohawk Reservation. The villagers have since renamed their community &quot;Kana꞉takon&quot; (&quot;the village&quot;, in Mohawk).

After victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the British took over Canada and New France east of the Mississippi River. They allowed the &quot;Kanienʼkehá꞉ka&quot; to continue to have Catholic priests at their mission. The Jesuits helped preserve Mohawk culture, translating the Bible and liturgy into Mohawk. They observed Mohawk customs, for instance, refusing to marry individuals who belonged to the same clan, as this was prohibited by kinship practices. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, they maintained parish registers that recorded the Mohawk names of individuals for life events, even when the people had taken European names as well.

At the time of the American Revolutionary War, the Mohawk, Onondaga, Seneca and Cayuga were allied with the British against the rebel American colonists. Forced to cede most of their remaining lands in New York to the new government after the colonists&#x27; victory, many of the Iroquois people migrated to Canada, where many settled at the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation.

Some Mohawk joined the growing community at Akwesasne. Under the Jay Treaty, the Iroquois retained rights to cross the newly established borders between Canada and the United States in order to maintain their trade and tribal ties. In 1806, Catholic Cayuga, Oneida and Onondaga from Ogdensburg, New York, joined the St. Regis band.

===Battle of the Cedars===
The Battle of the Cedars () was a series of military confrontations, early in the American Revolutionary War, which involved limited combat. The actions took place between May 19–27, 1776, at and around Les Cèdres, Quebec (located west of Montreal), in the later stages of the American colonial invasion of Quebec that began in September 1775. No casualties occurred.
Claude de Lorimier, a British Indian agent from Montreal, traveled west to &quot;Oswegatchie&quot; (Ogdensburg, New York), where there was a fort garrisoned by a company of the 8th Regiment of Foot under the command of British Captain George Forster. De Lorimier proposed recruiting some Indians to launch an attack from the west on Montreal, then held by the American Continental Army. When Forster agreed, Lorimier went to Akwesasne, where he recruited 100 warriors for battle. The British-allied forces took some American prisoners during the encounters, but these were later freed.

=== Dundee land claim ===
In the early 1800s, non-indigenous settlers leased a part of the Akwesnasne reserve located in mainland Quebec, known as Dundee. In 1888, the superintendent of Indian Affairs requested that the band surrender this land. They surrendered the land, but the First Nation always contested the validity of the action by the government, as they had not intended to surrender it.

In the 20th century, the First Nation of Akwesnasne filed a claim with the government for compensation for that land surrender. It was a period in which the nations were working to correct earlier wrongs and to assert their sovereignty over their treaty territories. In December 2018, Akwesasne accepted a specific claim settlement of $240M for the Dundee parcel, 37 years after they had first filed their claim was first filed ith the government of Canada.

===20th-century institutions===
Kana:takon School, originally called the Saint Regis Village School, was run by the Catholic Sisters of Saint Anne until the 1970s. Today, the mission is still active and includes a rectory, the large stone church dating to 1795, and a cemetery. Parish records show that the Jesuits respected Mohawk traditions, recording their Mohawk names through the 18th and 19th centuries, even after they had also taken European names.

The Roman Catholic parish at Akwesasne falls under three dioceses because of international borders and provincial boundaries: the Diocese of Alexandria-Cornwall and the Diocese of Valleyfield in Canada, and the Diocese of Ogdensburg in New York.

Following passage of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the United States federal government encouraged the tribe to adopt a constitution and elected government. The Mohawk chose to retain their traditional system of hereditary chiefs.

In the 1940s, Ernest Benedict founded Akwesasne&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;Kawehras!&quot; (&quot;It Thunders!&quot;). Benedict covered the resistance of many Mohawk to the system of elections imposed by the federal government on the &quot;American&quot; side of Akwesasne. The US had insisted on representative elections. On May 24, 1948, a vote was held in which &quot;The Six Nations Chiefs&quot;, based on historic clans and hereditary office, received 83 votes. &quot;The Elected Chiefs&quot; received only one vote, and &quot;The Seven Nations Chiefs&quot; did not receive any votes. The elected chiefs resigned from office, but the federal government continued to require the tribe to hold elections.

Both the federal government and New York State encouraged the tribe to adopt representative elected government, but they resisted. In the 1950s, the Mohawk of St. Regis were among federally recognized tribes to be added to a congressional list for termination of tribal status in relation to the federal government. It was part of a US policy to lift special treatment of certain Indian nations as part of a policy of assimilation. But Congress did not approve the termination of the St. Regis Reservation.

In 1969, Benedict founded the North American Indian Travelling College (now known as the Native North American Travelling College), which serves as a cultural centre, publishing house, and resource for classes and lectures at Akwesasne and beyond. It operates an art gallery and theatre at Akwesasne.

In the late 1960s, a period of heightened Native American activism, Benedict also started &quot;Akwesasne Notes.&quot; The newspaper became highly influential and the largest native newspaper in the world. Among its noted features were a series of posters included as centrefolds. A supporter gave the newspaper Edward Curtis photographs, which editors combined with quotes from Native American authors for the popular poster series.

In 1987, the Akwesasne Task Force on the Environment was founded in response to environmental concerns, including extensive contamination by PCB (Polychlorinated biphenyl) as a byproduct of industries located along the St. Lawrence River.

In the 1990s, the people of Akwesasne raised money in a variety of ways to fund a renovation of their 200-year-old St. Regis Church. They wrote a history of the church and its priests.

===Surrounding communities===
Akwesasne borders the towns of Brasher, New York, Fort Covington, New York and Bombay, New York. Sections of the southeastern portion of Akwesasne are considered by the Town of Bombay to be within the town&#x27;s jurisdiction but the tribe disputes this. To the west is the Town of Massena, New York. Many islands in the St. Lawrence River are part of Akwesasne. Generally the &quot;Akwesasro꞉non&quot; are majority English-speaking in daily use.

On the Canadian parts of the territory, Akwesasne borders the towns of Cornwall, Ontario, and Dundee, Quebec.

==Government==
Akwesasne is governed by three bodies: the Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs (traditional government), the elected Mohawk Council of Akwesasne in the North, and Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe in the South. The latter are the two recognized by the governments of Canada and the United States, respectively, as well as by lower-level jurisdictions such as provinces and states.

===Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs===
The Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs (MNCC, colloquially &quot;the Longhouse&quot;) is the &quot;traditional&quot; governing and religious body of the Mohawk (Kahniakehaka) people. The MNCC operates as a member nation of the Iroquois Confederacy or &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;.

===Mohawk Council of Akwesasne===
The Mohawk Council of Akwesasne (MCA) is a government whose representatives are elected within the northern districts of the territory on the Canadian side of the border. The MCA was developed from the Indian Bands system introduced by the Indian Act of Canada and the Act&#x27;s historical and legal predecessors. They are known to Canada as &quot;Mohawks of Akwesasne Bands 59 and 15&quot;.

The MCA operates as a non-partisan, representative democracy, divided into three geographic and administrative districts. The districts are Kana:takon (Saint Regis, Quebec), Kawehno:ke (Cornwall Island, Ontario) and Tsi Snaihne (Snye, Quebec). The several islands of the St. Lawrence River within the jurisdiction of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne are generally counted as being a part of the nearest mainland.

General elections are held triennially, with 12 representatives (Chiefs) chosen from the districts and one Grand Chief. Each district elects four Chiefs, and all districts vote at-large to elect a Grand Chief. Thus the council is 12 plus 1. A by-election may also be held if one or more of the seats become vacant.

===Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe===
The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (SRMT) is a government elected by Mohawk Tribal citizens of the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation, a southern district of the territory within the border of the United States. The SRMT operates as a Constitutional republic. The Tribal Council is composed of three Chiefs, three Sub-Chiefs, and a Tribal Clerk. Elections are held each year on the first Saturday of June to choose one Chief and one Sub-Chief for a three-year term. The Tribal Clerk is chosen every third year.

===Governance: Canada and the United States===
In 1960, First Nations people were enfranchised in Canada. In 1985, Status Indians who voted in a Canadian election were allowed to retain their status. Previously they would have become non-Status, as per the Indian Act. It is uncertain how many Akwesasro꞉non participate in Canadian elections.

Akwesasne is currently represented in Canada&#x27;s Parliament by:
* Claude DeBellefeuille, Bloc Quebecois MP (Salaberry—Suroît, Quebec)
* Eric Duncan, Conservative Party MP (Stormont-Dundas-South Glengarry, Ontario)

Akwesasne is represented in the:

* Lesislative Assembly of Ontario by Nolan Quinn, Progressive Conservative MPP (Stormont-Dundas-South Glengarry, Ontario)
* National Assembly of Quebec by Carole Mallette, Coalition Avenir Québec MNA (Huntingdon, Quebec)

In 1924, Native Americans were enfranchised in the United States if they had not been previously; by that time, two-thirds were already citizens. During the era of Indian Removal of the 1830s, Native Americans who chose to stay in historic territories became state and federal citizens; those who moved with their tribes to Indian Territory were not considered citizens. As Native American lands were purchased during the nineteenth century and Native land claims were extinguished, more were classified as US citizens as they moved to reservations.

Akwesasne is represented in the United States Senate by:
* United States Senator Charles Schumer (D- NY)
* United States Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D- NY)

Akwesasne is represented in the:
*United States House of Representatives by Representative Elise Stefanik (R-21st, NY)
*New York State Assembly by Representative Billy Jones
*New York Senate by Senator Dan Stec

==Legal system==

In 2016, Akwesasne established an independent indigenous legal system and court to deal with non-criminal offenses within the reserve. The 32 new laws cover civil matters handled by an indigenous legal team director of public prosecution, public prosecutor and two justices.

The system does not rely on jail terms but uses restorative justice to bring resolution between the accused and plaintiff. The members of the legal team are not required to have a law degree but are required to complete training and are approved by a review commission.

==Education==
Akwesasne has five elementary schools on the territory. Generally, Akwesasnro:non travel off the reservation for secondary education.

Post-secondary education is offered on the reservation through Iohahi:io Akwesasne Education &amp; Training Institute and State University of New York (SUNY) extension programs with the SRMT.

===Education in Canada===
Three schools, in Canada, are under the direction of the Ahkwesasne Mohawk Board of Education (AMBE):
* Ahkwesahsne Mohawk School – K–4, K–5, grades 1–8 (Cornwall Island, Ontario)
* Kana:takon School – K–4, K–5, grades 1–5 (Akwesasne, Quebec)
* Tsi Snaihne School – K–4, K–5, grades 1–8 (Quebec)
Prior to 1987, the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada controlled K–12 education on the Canadian side. The Ahkwesasne Mohawk Board of Education, established by the MCA two years prior, gained operations of those schools from the department in 1987.

AMBE agrees to pay tuition for high school students to two school districts in Ontario: Upper Canada District School Board (UCDSB), with AMBE-tuition-paid students going to Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School and some other UCSDB programs, and Catholic District School Board of Eastern Ontario (CDSBEO), with AMBE-tuition-paid students going to St Joseph&#x27;s Secondary School and some other CDSBEO programs. UCDSB categorizes Cornwall Island to be in the district&#x27;s Ward 11.

 schools located in Canada take Akwesasne children living in the United States.

===Education in the United States===
One school is under the direction of the Salmon River Central School District of New York, which covers the whole St. Regis Mohawk Reservation, and a portion of the census-designated place (in New York State, United States):.
* St. Regis Mohawk School – Pre-K to grade 6 – It is located on the reservation property. The State of New York owns the building and provides repairs, while the school district staffs the school and provides operational services.
The zoned secondary schools of the Salmon River district are Salmon River Middle School and Salmon River High School. Other portions of the CDP are within the Brasher Falls Central School District and the Massena Central School District.

There are Head Start programs in the United States part of Akwesasne. some children living in the Canadian side use these programs.

===Private schools===
There is one private school:
* Akwesasne Freedom School (in New York) - Pre-K to grade 8, featuring Kanienʼkehá immersion to strengthen language and culture on the reserve. With children learning Kanienʼkehá, many parents and other adults are now taking language classes, too. The Akwesasne model of language and cultural revival is being followed by other communities.

==Media==

==Political activism==

===1969 border crossing dispute===
In the winter of 1969, Cornwall City Police were confronted by a demonstration by Akwesasro꞉non at the North Channel Bridge of what is now called the Three Nations Crossing. By blocking traffic on the bridge, Akwesasro꞉non sought to call attention to their grievance that they were prohibited by Canadian authorities from duty-free passage of personal purchases across the border. They claimed this right by the 1795 Jay Treaty, which allowed indigenous free passage across the border that separated their established territory.

===2001 &quot;anti-globalization&quot; direct action===
The NYC Ya Basta Collective was a group of anti-globalization activists, based primarily in New York City, active from roughly October 2000 through October 2001.

Initiated in October 2000 by L. Fantoni and Casper on the heels of the anti-International Monetary Fund/World Bank protests in Prague, a collective soon formed and developed its own variation of the &quot;Tute Bianche&quot; tactic of the padded bloc. The collective organized several actions and events highlighting the inadequacy of borders, in support of immigrant rights and against racism and racialist hate groups.

In April 2001, this collective, along with the Direct Action Network, was active in organizing a US / Canada border crossing over the Three Nations Crossing. This event preceded demonstrations surrounding the 3rd Summit of the Americas, a summit held in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. An estimated 500 anti-globalists, along with a few Akwesasro꞉non, challenged the legitimacy of the US/Canada border. Although the Collective peacefully crossed into Cornwall, Ontario, Canada, they never made it to Quebec City. Most of the activists who participated in the action at the border and attempted to enter Canadian territory were turned away by Canada Border Service agents and prevented from attending the protests in Quebec City.

===2009 border crossing dispute===

On 1 June 2009, Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) border services officers at the Cornwall Port of Entry walked off the job in response to encampments of Akwesasro꞉non across the road from the customs facility. The latter were protesting Canada&#x27;s arming of CBSA border services officers. The encampment, styled as a &quot;unity rally&quot;, was branded as a campaign to bring awareness to complaints of alleged human rights abuses committed against Akwesasro꞉non by the CBSA border services officers.

The protest continued for several days but reached its peak at midnight of 1 June, when the new policy of arming border services officers with Beretta Px4 Storm sidearms went into effect. The border services officers left at the end of their shift. A new shift did not arrive, leaving the port of entry vacant.

Cornwall City Police blockaded the north terminus of the Three Nations Bridge to deny travelers entry into Canada. At the request of Canada, the New York State Police likewise blocked access from the United States onto the bridge. Akwesasne was cut off from its major access point into Canada and from free travel within the territory until a temporary border post was erected on July 13, 2009.

Police, border patrol, state troopers, RCMP, and various government agents blocked the road leading to the homes on Cornwall Island, Ontario, from May 2009 until July 2009. Each time any Mohawk attempted to leave their homes or return to their homes in Akwesasne, they were interrogated by government agents. Some Mohawk moved out of their homes because of the stress of this situation. Other residents were ordered to pay costs of $1000 each time CBSA agents chose to impound their vehicles, sometimes more than once per day when residents needed to use their vehicles for several trips. Some residents traveled instead by boat to seek medical attention, or purchase water, and groceries.

===History of disputes===
The area has been the scene of several disputes on the rights of the residents to cross the border unimpeded. These issues have been a concern for Canadian authorities, as the area is alleged to be a large-scale, cigarette-smuggling route from the U.S. There have been arrests and seizure of goods in the past. There are also concerns about smuggling of drugs, liquor, and migrants.

Residents of Akwesasne differ over reserve governance and which political factions they support. Political rivalries were expressed after one group brought casino gambling onto the reserve. It brought huge economic returns to casino owners and some benefits to the First Nation, but members also worried about how the enterprise would affect their culture. In 1989 unidentified suspects threw firebombs at a chartered bus. In a separate incident, someone fired a shotgun at a bus in the customs area.

The political feuds have resulted in violence: two Mohawk men were killed at Akwesasne in 1990, and thousands of residents left their homes in that period because of attacks on houses and vehicles, and general unrest. The Warrior Society, a self-appointed security force, used assault rifles and bats to break up anti-gambling roadblocks at the reservation entrances. They threatened to shoot any outside law enforcement officials if they entered the reservation.

==Arms trafficking and human smuggling==
According to police sources, the cross-border conduit in Akwesasne is being used by organized crime to smuggle marijuana back into the United States and harder drugs and firearms to Canada. According to a TVA News investigation, the weapons are purchased in the states of Texas, Alabama, Georgia and Florida to be transported north and stored in warehouses on the reserve. On winter nights, smugglers illegally cross the border on snowmobiles along the frozen St. Lawrence River. In the summer, they use motorboats.

In June 2022, the Quebec government announced it will provide $6.2 million over 5 years to the Akwesasne Mohawk Police Service (AMPS) to combat illegal firearm trafficking.

Due to its geography and lack of resources from the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), human smuggling has been an ongoing issue for the community. A 1999 Maclean&#x27;s magazine article outlined how many people of the Akwesasne community facilitated and profited from human smuggling. In 2023, eight people died attempting to cross into the US from Canada. Akwesasne Mohawk Police blamed migrants and other smugglers for exploiting disadvantaged members of their community.

==In popular culture==

<text>Giancarlo Baghetti (; 25 December 1934 – 27 November 1995) was an Italian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Baghetti won the 1961 French Grand Prix in a privateer Ferrari 156, and remains the only driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix on debut.

Born and raised in Milan, Baghetti started his racing career aged 23 in production cars before progressing to Formula Junior in 1958. Three years later, he was selected by FISA to compete in a non-works Ferrari 156. After winning his first two non-championship Formula One races at the Syracuse and Naples Grands Prix, Baghetti made his World Championship debut with FISA at the 1961 French Grand Prix. He went on to win the race, beating the Porsche of Dan Gurney to score a hat-trick of wins in his opening three Formula One races, and become the first driver to win on his World Championship debut since the inaugural season. Despite scoring a fastest lap at the and a non-championship victory at the Coppa Italia, Beghetti would never finish on the podium again. After the success of his rookie season, he signed for Ferrari in , followed by seasons with ATS in and Scuderia Centro Sud in . Baghetti made one-off appearances for Brabham, Parnell and Lotus prior to leaving the sport at the conclusion of the season.

Outside of Formula One, Baghetti won the 1000cc European Touring Car Championship in 1966 with Abarth, before retiring from motor racing two years later.

==Formula One career==
Baghetti was born in Milan. His father was a wealthy Milan industrialist. He began racing in 1955 in production cars, moving up to Formula Junior in 1958. In 1961 he was selected by the &quot;Federazione Italiana Scuderie Automobilistiche&quot; (FISA), a coalition of independent Italian team owners who had agreed a loan deal with Ferrari for a 156 Formula Two car to run in non-Championship Grand Prix, giving experience to promising Italian drivers. Despite not showing spectacular form in lower categories, Baghetti was chosen over Albino Buttichi and Lucien de Sanctis for the seat. The car was first entered for the Syracuse Grand Prix, the first major event run under the new 1.5-litre championship regulations, and against a strong field Baghetti qualified second and won in the only Ferrari, with the British teams and Porsche 718 flat 4 unable to compete with the Dino&#x27;s V6. He then drove the same car to win at the Napoli Grand Prix a few weeks later.

Team FISA entered an original 60-degree V6 Ferrari 156, at least 10 hp down on power, for Baghetti in the 1961 French Grand Prix at Reims-Gueux, for this World Championship event. Once Wolfgang von Trips, Richie Ginther and Phil Hill had all retired their works 156s, Baghetti was left to uphold Ferrari honour. He overcame Dan Gurney&#x27;s Porsche 718 to take victory, giving him a hat trick of wins from his first three Grands Prix. Gurney was leading with to go as the cars raced to the finish line at . The victory meant Baghetti became the first Italian since 1956 to win a Formula One World Championship event. It also ensured that he became the first, and only driver ever to win on their World Championship Grand Prix debut against a field that did not consist entirely of other debutant drivers.

He entered two more Championship races, retiring from the 1961 British Grand Prix and 1961 Italian Grand Prix, though he posted fastest lap in the latter. He also won the poorly attended Prima Coppa Italia race at Vallelunga in a Porsche 718.

He was promoted to the works Ferrari line-up for 1962, but took just two Championship placings – fourth at the Dutch Grand Prix, and fifth at the Italian Grand Prix, as Ferrari was outclassed by the British teams. Baghetti took second in the non-Championship Mediterranean Grand Prix. He was offered a full Ferrari F1 drive for 1963, but had already signed with a rival team. Enzo Ferrari rated Baghetti highly, calling him, &#x27;a lesser Varzi&#x27;. Baghetti was involved in 1963 in the disastrous ATS effort in 1963, joining up with Phil Hill for Carlo Chiti&#x27;s breakaway team, but failed to register a finish from five starts. For 1964 he switched to Scuderia Centro Sud&#x27;s outdated BRM P57 cars, peaking with seventh at the Austrian Grand Prix. His Grand Prix career was then virtually over, though he had three more one-off drives, all at the Italian Grand Prix – a works Brabham in 1965, a Reg Parnell-semiworks Dino Ferrari 2.4 V6 in which he ran strongly ahead of Arundell&#x27;s Lotus V8 Climax and Anderson&#x27;s 2.7 litre Brabham, running 5th in 1966 and a similarly competent drive in a works Lotus 49 in 1967, running in midfield and passing Amon and Ickx and would have scored a point but for a blown engine.

==Post-Formula One racing==
He achieved some success in the European Touring Car Championship with Alfa Romeo and FIAT Abarth, winning the 1966 1000cc Class Championship in an Abarth 1000. After dabbling in Formula Three, he retired after a huge accident at the 1967 &quot;Monza Lottery&quot;. Boley Pittard of England was burned severely when his Lola burst into flames at the start of the final qualifying heat. Baghetti won the event in a Branca with an average speed over thirty-five laps of . In June 1968, Baghetti was in a huge pile-up on the 23rd lap of a Formula Two race at Monza. He was driving a Dino.

He later became a journalist and photographer in motorsport and fashion, and promoted various industrial videos for Fiat.

==Death and legacy==
Baghetti&#x27;s Championship debut win has secured him a footnote in Formula One history, as he became the only driver to have won his first three Formula One races, starting with two non-championship Grand Prix races in Italy. Baghetti died of cancer on 27 November 1995.

<doc id="1228421" wikidata="Q171467" url="?curid=1228421" title="Giovanni Lavaggi">
<text>Giovanni Lavaggi (born 18 February 1958) is an Italian racing driver.

Despite Lavaggi being a nobleman by background, he could not count on personal financial resources; therefore he started racing only at the age of 26. Nevertheless, he managed to reach the top class of motorsport, racing in Formula One in 1995 and 1996. His first involvement in F1 was in 1992 when, being a mechanical engineer, he was official test driver for the March F1 team. In 1995, he drove for Lotus-Pacific for four races in which he was forced to retire due to gearbox problems. In the second part of 1996 racing season, he joined the Minardi team for six races. His best result was a tenth place at the Hungaroring, which was the second best result of the year for Minardi team.

He lives in Monte Carlo.

==Early life==
Lavaggi was born in Augusta, Sicily on 18 February 1958, being of noble heritage. He studied mechanical engineering at Milan Polytechnic.

==Racing career==
Lavaggi&#x27;s racing career started in 1984, inspired by Henry Morrogh who judged him the best student he ever had at his racing school. That year he was official driver of the constructor Ermolli in the Italian Formula Panda championship where he was classified second, winning more races than any other driver. Not having enough sponsorship to afford a whole season in Formula Three, he did a few races in the Italian Formula Three Championship before turning to Group C sports cars, in order to gain international experience. In this category, he soon became a driver for the Porsche Kremer Team, for whom he became the 1993 Interserie champion, winning six of the season&#x27;s total of 12 races and taking four further podium finishes. He also won the 1995 Daytona 24 Hours, driving nine hours in a team of four drivers. He scored two more wins in the FIA Sportscar Championship, including the 1000 km of Monza, where he drove five of the race&#x27;s six hours and took five more podium places and two pole positions.
His first race in F1 was at the German Grand Prix for Pacific in 1995. Prior to this he was a test driver for March during the 1992 season. He tested the Pacific PR02 twice before his first race for the British team - once at Silverstone and once at Snetterton. He was a rookie, but, at the same time, being 35 years old, he was the oldest driver in the field; therefore, he had to fight against the scepticism of the F1 media. The Pacific PR02 was an unreliable machine and he retired from all 4 races in 1995. His last experience in F1 was the 1996 Bologna Motorshow. Racing in a Minardi against two Benettons (driven by Jarno Trulli and Giancarlo Fisichella), two Ligiers (Olivier Panis and Shinji Nakano) and the other Minardi (Tarso Marques), he finished second, losing the final against Fisichella by a nose.

After his F1 career, Lavaggi founded his own team “Scuderia Lavaggi” and in 2006 he became a constructor designing and building his own Le Mans Prototype, the Lavaggi LS1. He raced the car in the Le Mans Series until 2009 and he scored a pole position at 2008 Vallelunga 6h. Lavaggi is the only example of a driver-constructor in the modern era of motorsport at high-level.

He was nicknamed &quot;Johnny Carwash&quot; (an approximate translation of his name from Italian to English, John Washes) by people in the paddock; US talk show host David Letterman helped bring the nickname to popular attention.

==Family==
The Lavaggi noble family moved from Genoa to Sicily (Palermo) in 1420 and then from Palermo to Augusta in 1711. A cousin of Giovanni’s grandfather, also called Giovanni Lavaggi, was a war hero. He was a pilot of the Italian Air Force and he died because of the sabotage of his airplane, while bringing to Asmara the Italian minister of public works Luigi Razza, who also was killed in the crash. In the cities of Catania and Augusta, Via Giovanni Lavaggi (Giovanni Lavaggi Road) is named after him.

<text>Giulio Cabianca (19 February 1923 – 15 June 1961) was a Formula One driver from Italy.

Cabianca was born in Verona, northern Italy. He participated in 4 World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 18 May 1958. He scored a total of 3 championship points. He also participated in one non-Championship Formula One race. He also won the Dolomites Gold Cup Race in 1955.

Cabianca&#x27;s death resulted from a bizarre incident at the Modena Autodrome test track in Italy. The Modena Autodrome was situated near Via Emilia, which crosses the city of Modena. Cabianca was testing a Cooper-Ferrari F1 car, owned by Scuderia Castellotti, when he suffered a suspected gearbox failure. Unable to stop, his Cooper went off track, struck a spectator and then went through the gate of the Autodrome which was open because of men at work near the track. The car crossed the Via Emilia, collided with several vehicles, then crashed against the wall of a coachbuilder shop. Cabianca was killed, as were a minivan driver, a motorcycle rider, and a bicyclist.

<doc id="1228425" wikidata="Q172535" url="?curid=1228425" title="Graham McRae">
<text>Graham Peter McRae (5 March 1940 – 4 August 2021) was a racing driver from New Zealand. 

He achieved considerable success in Formula 5000 racing, winning the Tasman Series each year from 1971 to 1973, and also at the 1972 L&amp;M Continental 5000 Championship in the United States.

McRae&#x27;s single outing in the Formula One World Championship was at the 1973 British Grand Prix on 14 July 1973, where he retired in the first lap. McRae also competed in the 1973 Indianapolis 500, finishing in 16th position and earning Rookie of the Year.

==Racing career==
McRae was born in Wellington, New Zealand. As a qualified engineer, McRae competed in local sport car racing and hillclimbs in the early 1960s, notably at Levin and began to compete seriously in the 1.5 twin cam formula, which used an old F3 chassis. 

After running a dated Brabham chassis, McRae built a slim, McRae, National Formula car which dominated the 1968–69 series, beating talented opponents in David Oxton, Ken Smith and Bert Hawthorne. 

He also ran in the four NZ rounds of the Tasman Series, and McRae proved surprisingly competitive at the tight Levin circuit where McRae, 160 hp down on power qualified 1.8 seconds slower than Jochen Rindt and almost equalled the time of GLTL Team Leader Graham Hill in a mishandling Lotus 49. This performance secured McRae the NZ Driver to Europe scholarship for a few 1969 F2 races where he ran in the upper midfield in an ageing Brabham BT23.

Before entering Formula One, McRae placed third in both the 1970 Guards European Formula 5000 Championship and first in the 1971 Rothmans European Formula 5000 Championship. He won a number of rounds, but was hindered by some accidents, one serious, and impatience which earned him the nickname, &#x27;Cassius&#x27; (after the boxing champion) reflecting his strut and belief in the greatness of his own talent.

Fields were strong in European F5000 at this time and McRae was competing against former F1 drivers Brian Redman, Trevor Taylor, Mike Hailwood and Frank Gardner, all world class drivers and Peter Gethin and Howden Ganley in works backed McLarens. McRae was Tasman Series Champion three years in a row, from 1971 to 1973, also taking the US F5000 Championship crown in 1972, with three race wins. The US 5000 championship win in 1972 was a noted achievement against competent F5000 and World Championship sports car drivers David Hobbs and Sam Posey and McRae won a lot of money and laurels, and drove with control despite also competing in the 1972 Rothmans European Formula 5000 Championship, in which he placed third.

In the combined F1/F5000 International Trophy, McRae finished seventh, the first F5000 car and for a while had run ahead of Graham Hill in a F1 Brabham BT34 and kept up with the F1 McLarens of Denny Hulme and Peter Revson, this reflected the very good race car set up skills of McRae on his Leda F5000. McRae would probably have got a regular F1 drive if he had not been a difficult customer and probably too old at 32 in most teams&#x27; eyes to be developed as a serious F1 driver. He was offered a drive in F1 at Nivelles when Jackie Stewart suffered an ulcer, but could not fit it into his demanding programme. He did race for Frank Williams in the British GP the following year but it was an uncompetitive chassis, and a good start was ruined by the multi-car crash which stopped the race after a lap.

In 1973, he faced much stronger competition in US F5000 with F1 drivers James Hunt and Jody Scheckter having far better financed efforts and more support. McRae also contested the 1973 Rothmans 5000 European Championship, but recorded only one round win, at Mallory Park. 1974 was McRae&#x27;s last good year and despite lack of finance and contractual disputes over his new McRae GM2 and its Talon derivative, McRae finished eighth in the US F5000 series and would have been fifth if he had not lost third place with tyre failure at Las Vegas, where he was running ahead of Unser. 

After writing off the GM2 in practice for the Oran Park, the Tasman round at the start of 1975, McRae contested the US F5000 National Travellers Cheque series, in a Lola T332 which showed promise in the heats, finishing fourth behind J.P Jarier at Watkins Glen and second in a heat at Laguna Seca to Al Unser, ahead of Warwick Brown and qualifying eighth at Long Beach, but never finished better than eighth in the main race during the series. McRae debuted his new GM3 at the last US F5000 race in Riverside in 1976, and retired from midfield. 

The car featured Perspex windows in the cockpit (like the Tyrrell P34), so the spectators could watch Graham at the wheel. But with the US F5000 regulations being changed to require the cars to carry Can Am sports car bodies, McRae took a year to revise the GM3 and unsponsored he could not pay for competitive engines, and privateer competition against the Haas or Paul Newman teams was hopeless. In 1978, he won his fifth F5000 title, the Australian Drivers&#x27; Championship.

== Death ==
McRae died on 4 August 2021 at the age of 81.

==McRae Cars==

In 1972 McRae, Malcolm Bridgland of Malaya Garage, and car designer Len Terry built a new F5000. The car was initially designated the Leda LT27 following Terry&#x27;s designs. McRae used the name Leda GM1 for his personal car. In mid-1972 McRae and London insurance broker John Heynes bought out Bridgland and set up a United Kingdom company McRae Cars Ltd at Poole, Dorset. As from 1 July 1972 the Leda was renamed the McRae GM1. Fourteen of these cars were built between 1972 and 1973. It achieved considerable success in the British Hill Climb Championship, driven by Roy Lane.

A one-off McRae GM2 was built in 1973 and the design was subsequently sold to Jack McCormack who built five examples under the name Talon. A single GM3 followed in 1976 and this was later developed into the GM9 Can-Am car.

McRae followed this up in 1993 with a replica of the Porsche 356 Speedster. It was based around a 2.0-litre Porsche 914 with a five-speed gearbox. McRae had imported a Porsche 356 Speedster from Vintage Speedsters of California to make the moulds for his production kits. Being a technical perfectionist, McRae&#x27;s Spyder is an accurate replica of original built by Porsche in 1954 and 1955. Some McRae Spyders are powered by a Subaru engine. In June 2000, McRae set up the New Zealand based McRae Cars Ltd. Since his illness in 2003, no more of these cars have been made and the existing 38 models are in high demand. The company was struck off the register in June 2003.

Former McRae GM1 owner and driver, Alister Hey of Queenstown registered McRae Cars Limited again in 2010.

<doc id="1228429" wikidata="Q171725" url="?curid=1228429" title="Gregor Foitek">
<text>Gregor Foitek (; born 27 March 1965) is a Swiss former racing driver. He won the 1986 Swiss Formula 3 Championship. Moving up to Formula 3000 he was widely blamed for causing a race-stopping crash at Brands Hatch in 1988, and at the restart nudging Johnny Herbert into a major crash where he sustained serious leg injuries. Foitek participated in 22 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 26 March 1989. He scored no championship points. He later made two CART starts for Foyt Enterprises in 1992 but was knocked out of both races by mechanical issues.

Today he helps run Foitek Automobile, a family-run Ferrari and Maserati dealership in Altendorf.

==Formula One career==

===1989: EuroBrun and Rial===
Foitek made his debut at the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix, however with turbos now banned from F1, the number of entries had grown to 39. Thirteen cars had to enter pre-qualifying and with EuroBrun having performed poorly in , Foitek had to enter the session using the ER188B, which was an update of the 1988 car. Foitek only got to the main qualifying session once, at the first race in Brazil, where he then failed to qualify. After 11 rounds Foitek quit the EuroBrun team.

At the Spanish Grand Prix, Foitek was called up to replace Christian Danner at the Rial team. However, the Rial team were having a bad season and several crew members had left the team. Furthermore, although it was assured of a place in the main qualifying session, the Rial ARC2 was uncompetitive, some five seconds off the next slowest car. In his one race with the team, Foitek&#x27;s rear wing broke at high speed and he crashed heavily. He immediately quit the team.

<text>Karl-Günther Bechem (; alias: &quot;Bernhard Nacke&quot;; 21 December 1921 – 3 May 2011) was a racing driver from Germany.

Bechem started out in sports car racing before competing in Formula Two in the 1952 German Grand Prix, driving a BMW under the alias &quot;Bernhard Nacke&quot;. He failed to finish the race, and so did not score any World Championship points. He continued driving an ex-Karl Gommann AFM-BMW (chassis 50–5) in Formula Two in 1953, at AVUS and then in the German Grand Prix at Nürburgring, again failing to finish. He was more successful in sports car racing with the Borgward team.

In 1954 Bechem crashed heavily while competing in the Carrera Panamericana, and although he recovered fully from his injuries, he never raced again at this high level.

<doc id="1228436" wikidata="Q1966033" url="?curid=1228436" title="Nasser Moghaddam">
<text>Lieutenant General Nasser Moghaddam (; 24 June 1921 – 11 April 1979) was an Iranian military officer who served as the fourth and final chief of SAVAK from 6 June 1978 to 12 February 1979. He assumed the position after the arrest of General Nematollah Nassiri in 1978, following an order issued by the Shah. Moghaddam, along with Nassri and Nassiri&#x27;s predecessor, Hassan Pakravan, was found guilty of corruption and subsequently sentenced to death on 11 March 1979, in accordance with the order of Ayatollah Khomeini.

==Early life==
Nasser Moghaddam was born in 1921 in Tehran, Qajar Iran. He attended a military high school and later pursued a law degree at the Faculty of Tehran University.

During his early years, Nasser lived with his father until the age of 10. From 1935 onwards, for reasons unknown, he resided with his uncle Hussein, who did not treat him kindly. Consequently, Nasser made the decision to return home.

In 1928, he enrolled in a primary school and in 1934, he joined the military school of Tehran, from which he graduated in 1940.

In 1941, during the final year of Reza Shah&#x27;s reign, Nasser enlisted in the Officers&#x27; School, where he remained until 1943. He completed his studies at the officers&#x27; academy, attaining the rank of 2nd rank lieutenant, and decided to pursue further education at the Faculty of Law, University of Tehran.

During his time at the Officers&#x27; School and the University of Tehran, Nasser not only acquired a solid foundation in military and security studies but also developed a proficient command of the French and English languages.

== Career in army and intelligence services ==
At the Officers&#x27; School, Nasser met Hossein Fardoust, an event he considered to be the most significant in his life. This was likely because the recent friendship between the Shah and Fardoust also contributed to his career growth. Thanks to his acquaintance with Fardoust, Nasser served in various divisions of the army until 1964, including the 10th Division of Khorasan, the 5th Division of Luristan, the Shah&#x27;s Guard, the Ministry of Defense, the Military Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, and the Academy.

In 1959, the &quot;Special Intelligence Bureau&quot; was established in Iran, and General Hossein Fardoust extended an offer to Moghaddam to collaborate with him. Nasser agreed to the proposal.

=== Uprising of 15 Khordad ===
After the suppression of the 15 Khordad uprising, General Fardoust capitalized on the situation and requested the Shah to replace Mustafa Amjadi, the director general of the Department of Internal Security, with Moghaddam. The Shah, aware of Amjadi&#x27;s close association with Teymur Bakhtiar, agreed to Fardoust&#x27;s suggestion. Moghaddam served as the director of the third Department for approximately 10 years. His responsibilities encompassed overseeing the actions of revolutionary groups and providing the Shah with weekly updates on the public sentiment, a task he purportedly executed competently.

==Second Bureau of Intelligence and Counterintelligence == 
In 1971, Lieutenant General Nasser Moghaddam was promoted to the position of Director of the Army&#x27;s Second Bureau of Intelligence and Counterintelligence.

On 19 April 1973, General Moghaddam assumed the role of Deputy Director General of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, serving under General Azizollah Palizban. The order stated that Nasser Moghaddam&#x27;s tenure in SAVAK had come to an end, and he would be appointed as the head of the Information Bureau of the 2nd Bureau while retaining the position of Adjutant to the Shah.

==Military ranks==
Moghaddam&#x27;s military ranks:
* 25 October 1966 – Brigadier General
* 23 October 1970 – Division General (Sarlashgar)
* 25 October 1971 – Shah&#x27;s personal adjutant.

== General Moghaddam at the head of SAVAK (June 1978 – February 1979) ==

In April 1978, General Moghaddam sent a confidential letter to the Shah, urging the monarch to take decisive action in light of the country&#x27;s circumstances. He emphasized the necessity of exemplary punishment for corrupt government officials associated with the royal family and stressed the importance of engaging in a constructive dialogue with the clergy. Additionally, it is evident from various sources that the CIA had been providing financial support to General Moghaddam for many years.

In an attempt to alleviate the tense situation, the Shah, under urgent request from Washington, made concessions to the Iranian public. In June 1978, he removed Nassiri, the powerful director of SAVAK. Lieutenant General Nasser Moghaddam was appointed as the new head of the secret police due to his connections within the opposition, including the Shiite clergy.

In contemporary times, many Iranians have criticized the Shah&#x27;s decision, considering it a mistake that weakened the Security Service. The threat came from entirely different forces. Unlike General Nassiri, Moghaddam advocated for a constructive dialogue with the religious opposition. It is worth nothing that Moghaddam had ties to opposition groups, including Shiite clerics.

Before assuming his new role, General Moghaddam served as the head of military counterintelligence. He was known for opposing the use of torture and his appointment aimed to facilitate better integration between the army and the secret service.

Upon assuming his position, Moghaddam focused on dismantling the influence of Nematollah Nassiri, who was then serving as the Iranian ambassador to Pakistan. Reports suggest that the CIA exerted pressure on Nassiri and his supporters to remove them from the intelligence service, with Nasser Moghaddam being the only viable replacement. During an interview, a former SAVAK officer currently in exile highlighted the significance of Nassiri&#x27;s dismissal, but also noted that the dismissal of General Ali Motazed, Nassiri&#x27;s deputy, was equally erroneous. With Moghaddam&#x27;s appointment, the era of SAVAK&#x27;s &quot;Iron rule&quot; came to an end.

General Moghaddam had previously served as the army&#x27;s chief of counterintelligence and was known for his opposition to torture during interrogations. His appointment to his new position was a result of the Shah&#x27;s desire to integrate the army and SAVAK, aiming to implement democratic reforms within the armed forces. As an example, Moghaddam allowed lawyers to attend the interrogations of defendants.

Following the riots of 21–22 July 1978, the Shah convened a meeting with two generals, Fardoust and Moghaddam, to discuss an action plan against the protesters. However, the meeting was failed to produce any substantial results.

=== Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti secret mission to Tehran (September 1978) ===
Shortly after Moghaddam&#x27;s appointment, a meeting took place between senior SAVAK officials and the leadership of the Iraqi intelligence service. During this meeting, the Iranian side raised concerns about neutralizing Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s political activities. Iraqi officials expressed their full solidarity on this matter. Notably, in early September 1978, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, the Director of Iraqi Intelligence, secretly traveled to Tehran. He conveyed Saddam Hussein&#x27;s proposal to the Shah: &quot;His Majesty must put down the revolt with an iron fist, and if you (the Shah) need help in this matter, Iraq is ready to stand by you.&quot; Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti suggested assassinating Khomeini, who was residing in Najaf at the time. Acting on the advice of Hossein Fardoust and Nasser Moghaddam, the Shah declined Saddam Hussein&#x27;s offer. Shortly afterward, Khomeini was expelled from the country and sought refuge in France. Controlling his activities was much easier while he was in Iraq, but in France it became increasingly challenging. Western media portrayed Khomeini as a global figure. Reuven Merhav, an Israeli intelligence officer, later observed that the Shah failed to grasp the consequences of his decision.

==Iranian Revolution==
The outbreak of the revolutionary wave was followed by an exodus of security and military officials from the country. For instance, Parviz Sabeti, who was in charge of the 3rd Department, departed on 27 November. General Gholam Ali Oveissi and Tehran Police Chief General Moulavi left Iran in January 1979 and relocated to the United States.

On 16 January 1979, the Shah and his family departed Iran. On 1 February, Khomeini returned from exile and assumed personal leadership of the revolutionary process. After three days of battling against the Shah&#x27;s Imperial Guard, Khomeini seized control.

Following the revolution&#x27;s victory, representatives of Mehdi Bazargan approached Moghaddam and offered him a prominent role in the establishment of a new security service. Moghaddam accepted the offer and later recollected, &quot;It seems that Bazargan will thank for the kindness I have done for him.&quot; Concurrently, Moghaddam attempted to destroy all documents in which he was implicated as a participant in repressive actions.

On 15 February, following the execution of former SAVAK director Nematohla Nassiri, Moghaddam realized that his situation was dire and decided to go into hiding temporarily, intending to leave the country at the earliest opportunity. However, he was swiftly apprehended and handed over to the Revolutionary Tribunal. Moghaddam was even impressed by the efficiency of the new security apparatus, stating, &quot;What smart people. If they were my employees at SAVAK, I would be much more successful.&quot;

While in prison, Moghaddam held hope for a prompt release and securing a favorable position with the support of Mehdi Bazargan. However, on 11 April 1979, General Nasser Moghaddam was executed by order of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal.

<text>Issy-les-Moulineaux () is a commune in the southwestern suburban area of Paris, France, lying on the left bank of the river Seine. Its citizens are called in French. It is one of Paris&#x27;s entrances and is located from Notre Dame Cathedral, which is considered Kilometre Zero in France. On 1 January 2010, Issy-les-Moulineaux became part of the &quot;Grand Paris Seine Ouest&quot; agglomeration community, which merged into the Métropole du Grand Paris in January 2016.

Issy-les-Moulineaux has successfully moved its economy from an old manufacturing base to high value-added service sectors and is at the heart of the Val de Seine business district, the largest cluster of telecommunication and media businesses in France, hosting the headquarters of most major French TV networks.

== Geography ==
Issy-les-Moulineaux is a municipality located on the edge of the 15th arrondissement of Paris, along the main axis between Paris and Versailles, and on the left bank of the Seine. The town is situated 7.5 kilometers southwest of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, the central point of France&#x27;s road network, and 3 kilometers from the town hall of the 15th arrondissement.

It is positioned 4 kilometers east of the sub-prefecture Boulogne-Billancourt and 11 kilometers southeast of the prefecture Nanterre. Within its territory, Issy-les-Moulineaux encompasses an island in the Seine: the Île Saint-Germain.

==Name==
Originally, Issy-les-Moulineaux was simply called Issy. The name Issy comes from Medieval Latin &quot;Issiacum&quot; or &quot;Isciacum&quot;, perhaps meaning &quot;estate of Isicius (or Iccius)&quot;, a Gallo-Roman landowner, although some think the name comes from a Celtic radical meaning &quot;under the wood&quot;. Local legend recounted on the city&#x27;s official website mentions alternative origin of the name arising from a temple of the Egyptian goddess Isis said to be under the site of the Church of Saint Stephen.

In 1893 Issy officially became Issy-les-Moulineaux. Les Moulineaux was the name of a hamlet on the territory of the commune, apparently named Les Moulineaux due to the water mill or mills () that stood there.

==History==

In July 1815 the Battle of Issy was fought in and around the village, between Prussian and French forces. This was one of the last actions of the &#x27;Hundred Days&#x27; campaign and was the final attempt to defend Paris against the armies of the Seventh Coalition.

The town was once the location of the Château d&#x27;Issy, destroyed in 1871, former home of the Princes of Conti. On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, about a third of the commune of Issy-les-Moulineaux was annexed to Paris, and forms now the neighborhood of Javel, in the 15th arrondissement of Paris.

Issy-les-Moulineaux is home to a community of 5,000 Armenians that have established themselves in the area since the 1930s. The community has two Armenian churches, an athletic club, a school, a monument dedicated to the Armenian genocide, and a street named after Armenia called &quot;Rue d&#x27;Armenie&quot;, and &quot;Rue d&#x27;Erevan&quot; named after Armenia&#x27;s capital Yerevan. Issy-les-Moulineaux became twin cities with Echmiadzin, Armenia in December 1989.

The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1895.

==Airfield==
In the late 19th century, an expansive field in Issy had been dedicated to military exercises. This land, owned by the French Army, was made into an airfield in the 1900s during the pioneering era of aviation. Issy-les-Moulineaux soon became a hot spot for aviation in France, the most active airfield in Paris, and the site of many flight experiments. Photographers, newspaper reporters and intelligence agents from other countries gathered there to report on developments.

The airfield of Issy-les-Moulineaux was the starting point of the 1911 Paris to Madrid air race. One of the competing planes crashed into the audience during take-off, killing the French Minister of War Henri Maurice Berteaux. It hosted the trap shooting events for the 1924 Summer Olympics.

The firm of Appareils d&#x27;Aviation Les Frères Voisin, the world&#x27;s first commercial airplane factory (1908) which was initially located in Boulogne-Billancourt, transformed itself into a luxury automobile manufacturing company named Avions Voisin in 1920. Most of Voisin&#x27;s manufacturing facilities were then relocated in neighboring Issy-les-Moulineaux. Avions Voisin closed its doors in 1940.

The last fixed wing flight occurred in 1953, after which the aerodrome handled only helicopters; it continues to do this, with the ICAO code LFPI. It is operated by Aéroports de Paris.

<text>Taliesin ( ; sometimes known as Taliesin East, Taliesin Spring Green, or Taliesin North after 1937) is a house-studio complex located south of the village of Spring Green, Wisconsin, United States. Developed and occupied by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, the estate is an exemplar of the Prairie School of architecture. Wright began developing the estate in 1911 on land that previously belonged to his maternal family.

Wright designed the main Taliesin home and studio with his mistress, Mamah Borthwick, after leaving his first wife, and home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. The design of the original building was consistent with the design principles of the Prairie School, emulating the flatness of the plains and the natural limestone outcroppings of Wisconsin&#x27;s Driftless Area. The structure (which included agricultural and studio wings) was completed in 1911. The name Taliesin, meaning &quot;shining brow&quot; in Welsh, was initially used for the first building, which was built on and into the brow of a hill; it was later extended to the entire estate.

Over the course of Wright&#x27;s occupancy, two major fires led to significant alterations; these three stages are referred to as Taliesin I, II, and III. In 1914, after a disturbed employee set fire to the living quarters and murdered Borthwick and six others, Wright rebuilt the Taliesin residential wing, but he used the second estate only sparingly, returning there in 1922 following the completion of the Imperial Hotel, Tokyo. An electrical fire gutted Taliesin II&#x27;s living quarters in April 1925, and he rebuilt it later that year. Wright lost the house to foreclosure in 1927 but was able to reacquire it the next year, with financial help from friends. In 1932, he established a fellowship for architectural students at the estate. Taliesin III was Wright&#x27;s home for the rest of his life, although he began to spend the winters at Taliesin West in Scottsdale, Arizona, upon its completion in 1937. Many of Wright&#x27;s acclaimed buildings were designed at Taliesin, including Fallingwater, the Jacobs I house, the Johnson Wax Headquarters, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Wright, who was also an avid collector of Asian art, used Taliesin as a storehouse and private museum.

Wright left Taliesin and the 600-acre Taliesin Estate to the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation (founded by him and his third wife in 1940) upon his death in 1959. This organization oversaw renovations to the estate until 1990, when a nonprofit organization known as Taliesin Preservation Inc. (TPI) took over responsibility. During the 1990s and 2000s, TPI renovated the estate to repair deterioration that took place over the years. , more than 25,000 people visit Taliesin each year. The Taliesin estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and it was listed as a World Heritage Site in 2019 as part of a group of eight listings known as &quot;The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;.

==Site==
Jones Valley, the Wisconsin River valley in which Taliesin sits, was formed during Pre-Illinoian glaciation. This region of North America, known as the Driftless Area, was totally surrounded by ice during Wisconsin glaciation, but the area itself was not glaciated. The result is an unusually hilly landscape with deeply carved river valleys.

The valley, approximately south of the village of Spring Green, Wisconsin, was originally settled by Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Richard Lloyd Jones. Jones had emigrated with his family from Wales, moving to the town of Ixonia in Jefferson County, Wisconsin. In 1858, Jones and the family moved from Ixonia to this part of Wisconsin to start a farm. By the 1870s, Jones&#x27; sons had taken over operation of the farm, and they invited Wright to work during summers as a farmhand.
Wright&#x27;s aunts Jane and Ellen C. Lloyd Jones (known as Jennie and Nell) began a co-educational school, the Hillside Home School, on the farm in 1887 and let Wright design the building; this was Wright&#x27;s first independent commission. In 1896, Wright&#x27;s aunts again commissioned Wright, this time to build a windmill. The resulting Romeo and Juliet Windmill was unorthodox but stable. By 1901 the school role was such that the original building was inadequate, and Wright was commissioned to design a replacement. This became Hillside Home School II, and Wright later sent several of his children to the school. Wright&#x27;s final commission on the farm was Tan-y-Deri, a house for his sister Jane Porter, completed in 1907. Tan-y-Deri, Welsh for &quot;under the oaks&quot;, was a design based on his recent &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot; article &quot;A Fireproof House for $5000.&quot; The family, their ideas, religion, and ideals, greatly influenced the young Wright, who later changed his middle name from Lincoln (in honor of Abraham Lincoln) to Lloyd in deference to his mother&#x27;s family.

==Etymology==
When Wright decided to construct a home in this valley, he chose the name of the Welsh bard Taliesin, whose name means &quot;shining brow&quot; or &quot;radiant brow&quot;. Wright learned of the poet through Richard Hovey&#x27;s &quot;Taliesin: A Masque&quot;, a story about an artist&#x27;s struggle for identity. The Welsh name also suited Wright&#x27;s roots, as the Lloyd Joneses gave Welsh names to their properties. The hill upon which Taliesin was built was a favorite from Wright&#x27;s youth; he saw the house as a &quot;shining brow&quot; on the hill, in hope of a place of refuge &quot;but I had forgotten grandfather Isiah&#x27;s punishments and beatings&quot;. Although the name was originally only applied to the house, Wright later used the term to refer to the entire property. Wright and others used roman numerals to distinguish the three versions of the house.

==Early history==

The Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio in Oak Park, Illinois, was Wright&#x27;s residence from 1889 to 1909. He built an architectural studio next to his Oak Park house in 1898. In Oak Park, Wright had developed his concept of Prairie School architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing a home for Edwin Cheney, but quickly took a liking for Cheney&#x27;s wife. Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909.

In October, Borthwick, having left her husband in the summer, met up with Wright in New York City. From there, they sailed to Berlin, so Wright could negotiate a portfolio of his work. After that, Wright and Borthwick parted temporarily. She had settled in Leipzig, Germany, teaching English, and Wright settled in Italy to continue work on the portfolio. Borthwick joined Wright in Italy in February. He moved his studio to Fiesole, a town within view of Florence. While in Fiesole, Wright was particularly inspired by Michelozzo&#x27;s Villa Medici because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens on two levels. In 1910, the pair sought to return to the United States, but knew they could not escape scandal if they returned together to Oak Park. Wright saw an alternative—his family&#x27;s ancestral land near Spring Green, Wisconsin. Wright returned alone to the United States in October 1910, publicly reconciling with his wife, Catherine, while working to secure money to buy land on which to build a house for himself and Borthwick Cheney. On April 3, 1911, Wright wrote to client, Darwin D. Martin, requesting money so that he could &quot;see about building a small house&quot; for his mother.

On the 10th, Wright&#x27;s mother Anna signed the deed for the property. By using Anna&#x27;s name, Wright was able to secure the property without attracting any attention to the affair. Late in the summer, Mamah Borthwick (having divorced Cheney and legally reverting to her maiden name) quietly moved into the property, staying with Wright&#x27;s sister, Jane Porter, at her home, Tan-y-Deri. However, Wright and Borthwick&#x27;s new property was discovered by a &quot;Chicago Examiner&quot; reporter that fall, and the affair made headlines in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; on Christmas Eve.

==Taliesin I==

At Taliesin, Wright wanted to live in unison with Mamah, his ancestry, and with nature. He chose only local building materials. The house was designed to nestle against the hill, in an example of Wright&#x27;s &quot;organic architecture&quot;. The bands of windows, one of his trademarks, allow nature to enter the house, and the fluid transitions from interior to exterior were radical for the time. This was in keeping with Wright&#x27;s belief that the architecture should be &quot;of&quot; the hill, not &quot;on&quot; it. &quot;I attend the greatest of churches. I spell nature with a capital N. That is my church&quot;, he said in a TV interview in 1957.

=== Architecture and layout ===
Taliesin I was composed of several partially detached structures in an &quot;L&quot;-shaped arrangement, which were connected by pergolas. There were three sections: a long section on the east, which held the residential wing (where Wright and Borthwick lived); a long section on the west, which held the agricultural wing; and an office wing connecting the two other sections. To the southwest of the main complex was a courtyard; there were stables, service functions, servants&#x27; quarters, and a garage across the courtyard. The one-story complex was accessed by a road leading up the hill to the rear of the building. The estate gateway was on County Road C, just west of Wisconsin Road 23. Iron entry gates were flanked by limestone piers capped with planter urns.

A porte-cochère or loggia, above the main entrance of the living quarters, provided shelter for visiting automobiles. The residential wing included a bedroom and a combined living–dining room, which protruded from the corner of the hill on two sides. The office wing held the drafting studio and workroom, and an apartment for the head draftsman. This apartment may have originally been intended for Wright&#x27;s mother. Typical of a Prairie School design, the house was, as Wright described, &quot;low, wide, and snug.&quot; As with most of his houses, Wright designed the furniture.

Wright chose yellow limestone for the house from a quarry of outcropping ledges on a nearby hill. Local farmers helped Wright move the stone up the Taliesin hill. Stones were laid in long, thin ledges, evoking the natural way that they were found in the quarry and across the Driftless Area. Plaster for the interior walls was mixed with sienna, giving the finished product a golden hue. This caused the plaster to resemble the sand on the banks of the nearby Wisconsin River. The outside plaster walls were similar, but mixed with cement, resulting in a grayer color. Windows were placed so that sun could come through openings in every room at every point of the day. Wright chose not to install gutters so that icicles would form in winter. The hip roof had a wood frame with shingles made of cedar; the shingles were intended to weather to a silver-grey color, matching the branches of nearby trees. The finished house measured approximately of enclosed space.

===Life at Taliesin===
Upon moving in with Borthwick in the winter of 1911, Wright resumed work on his architectural projects, but he struggled to secure commissions because of the ongoing negative publicity over his affair with Borthwick (whose ex-husband, Edwin Cheney, maintained primary custody of their son and daughter). However, Wright did produce some of his most acclaimed works during this time period, including the Midway Gardens in Chicago and the Avery Coonley Playhouse in Riverside. He also indulged his hobby for collecting Japanese art, and quickly became a renowned authority. Borthwick translated four works from Swedish difference feminist Ellen Key.

Wright designed the gardens with the assistance of landscape architect, Jens Jensen. This included over a thousand fruit trees and bushes ordered in 1912. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred McIntosh, fifty Wealthy, fifty Golden Russet, and fifty Fameuse. Among the bushes were three hundred gooseberry, two hundred blackberry, and two hundred raspberry. The property also grew pears, asparagus, rhubarb, and plums. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, because part of the orchard was destroyed during a railroad strike.

The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate, which may have been done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy. Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This water garden, probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.

In 1912, Wright designed what he called a &quot;tea circle&quot; in the middle of the courtyard, adjacent to the crown of the hill. This circle was heavily inspired by Jens Jensen&#x27;s council circles, but also took influence from Japanese wabi-sabi landscape architecture. Unlike Jensen&#x27;s circles, the rough-cut limestone tea circle was much larger and featured a pool in the center. The circle featured a curved stone bench flanked with Chinese jars built during the Ming Dynasty. The tea circle had two oak trees: one on the inner edge of the seating areas, and one just outside of the stone seat. The remaining oak tree (outside of the stone seat) blew down in a storm in 1998. The tea garden also included a large plaster replica of &quot;Flower in the Crannied Wall&quot;, a statue originally designed by Richard Bock for the Susan Lawrence Dana House, by Wright. The statue&#x27;s namesake poem is inscribed on its rear.

===1914 attack and fire===

Julian Carlton was a 31-year-old man who came to work as a chef and servant at Taliesin for the summer. Carlton was an Afro-Caribbean of West Indian descent, ostensibly from Barbados. He was recommended to Wright by John Vogelsong Jr., the caterer for the Midway Gardens project. Carlton and his wife Gertrude had previously served in the house of Vogelsong&#x27;s parents in Chicago. Originally a genial presence on the estate, Carlton grew increasingly paranoid. He stayed up late at night with a butcher knife, looking out the window. This behavior had been noticed by Wright and Borthwick, who issued an ad in a local paper for a replacement cook. Carlton was given notice that August 15, 1914, would be his last day in their employ.

Before he left, Carlton plotted to kill Taliesin&#x27;s workers and residents. His primary target was draftsman Emil Brodelle, who had racially abused Carlton on August 12 for not following an order. Brodelle and Carlton also engaged in a minor physical confrontation two days later. He planned the assault, targeting the noon hour, when Borthwick, her visiting children, and the studio personnel would be on opposite sides of Taliesin&#x27;s living quarters awaiting lunch. Wright was away in Chicago completing Midway Gardens while Borthwick stayed at home with her two children, 11-year-old John and 8-year-old Martha. As only two survived that day and there was no criminal trial, the sequence of events have been posited based on details from the two survivors (William Weston and Herbert Fritz), and evidence found at the scene.

On August 15, Carlton grabbed a shingling hatchet and began an attack. It is believed that he started with Borthwick and two of her children, John and Martha—who were waiting on the porch off the living room—as they were the most vulnerable of his targets. Apparently, Mamah Borthwick was killed by a single blow to the head, and her son John was killed as he sat in his chair. Martha managed to flee, but was hunted down and killed in the courtyard. Carlton then coated the bodies in gasoline and set them on fire, setting the house ablaze. He then attacked the living quarters where the staff were situated, pouring gasoline underneath the door of the far end of the quarters and setting them on fire. Draftsman Herbert Fritz managed to break open a window and escape, though he broke his arm in the process. Carlton mortally wounded Brodelle, and then attacked the other occupants.

With the house empty and people wounded, Carlton ran to the basement and into a fireproof furnace chamber. He had brought a small vial of hydrochloric acid with him and attempted suicide by swallowing it, but it failed to kill him. Together, Lindblom and Weston ran to a neighboring farm to send the alert of the attack. Weston then returned to Taliesin and used a garden hose to help extinguish the flames. His efforts saved the studio (with many of Wright&#x27;s drawings and manuscripts), as well as the agricultural part of the building. Eventually, neighbors arrived to assist in putting out the fire, to tend to survivors, and search for the murderer. Gertrude was found in a nearby field, apparently unaware of her husband&#x27;s intentions. She was dressed in travel clothes, expecting to catch a train to Chicago with Julian to seek a new job.
Later in the afternoon, Sheriff John Williams located Carlton and arrested him. Carlton was transferred to the county jail in Dodgeville. Gertrude was released from police custody shortly after the incident. She was sent to Chicago with $7 () and was never heard from again. The hydrochloric acid that Carlton ingested had badly burnt his esophagus, which made it difficult for him to ingest food. Carlton was indicted on August 16 and was charged with the murder of Emil Brodelle, the only death that was directly witnessed by a survivor. Carlton pleaded not guilty. Forty-seven days after the fire, before the case could be heard, Carlton died of starvation in his cell. Wright&#x27;s biographers in the 20th century tended not to discuss the Taliesin massacre; one biography dedicated only one paragraph to the attacks, while another said obliquely that the &quot;incident marked a rupture in Wright&#x27;s career&quot;. The Taliesin murders remained relatively obscure until the 2000s, when two books about the attacks were published.

===Aftermath===
The fire destroyed the living areas, but the agriculture wing and the drafting studio survived largely intact. The bodies of the dead and injured were brought to Tan-y-Deri, the nearby home of Wright&#x27;s sister, Jane Porter. The dead were Mamah and Brodelle, with John missing (his remains were later found incinerated). Martha Cheney, foreman Thomas Brunker, and Ernest Weston (13-year-old son of William Weston) would die later that day or that night. Gardener David Lindblom survived until August 18 (Tuesday morning). Wright returned to Taliesin that night with his son John and Edwin Cheney. Cheney brought the remains of his children back to Chicago while Wright buried Mamah Borthwick on the grounds of nearby Unity Chapel (the chapel of the mother&#x27;s side of his family). Heartbroken over the loss of his lover, Wright did not mark the grave because he could not bear to be reminded of the tragedy. He also did not hold a funeral service for Borthwick, although he did fund and attend his employees&#x27; services.

Wright struggled with the loss of Borthwick, experiencing symptoms of conversion disorder, insomnia, weight loss, and temporary blindness. After a few months of recovery, aided by his sister Jane Porter, Wright moved to an apartment he rented in Chicago at 25 East Cedar Street. The attack also had a profound effect on Wright&#x27;s design principles; biographer Robert Twombly writes that his Prairie School period ended after the loss of Borthwick.

==Taliesin II==

Shortly after the Taliesin massacre, Wright declared his intention to rebuild the complex. Within a few months of his recovery, Wright began rebuilding Taliesin, naming the rebuilt structure &quot;Taliesin II&quot;: There is release from anguish in action. Anguish would not leave Taliesin until action for renewal began. Again, and at once, all that had been in motion before at the will of the architect was set in motion. Steadily, again, stone by stone, board by board, Taliesin the II began to rise from Taliesin the first. The new complex was mostly identical to the original building and was constructed on the ruins of Taliesin I. Similarly to the original complex, Taliesin II was arranged around a set of terraces and courtyards. The dam (which burst less than a week after the murders) was rebuilt. Wright added an observation platform, perhaps inspired by the one he designed in Baraboo. Later, he built a hydroelectric generator in an unsuccessful effort to make Taliesin completely self-sufficient. The generator was built in the style of a Japanese temple. Within only a few years, parts of the structure eroded away. It was demolished in the 1940s.

Around Christmas time of 1914, while designing the residence after the first devastating fire, Wright received a sympathetic letter from &quot;Maude&quot; Miriam Noel, who contacted him after reading about the Taliesin fire and murders. Wright exchanged correspondence with the wealthy divorcee and met with her at his Chicago office. Wright was quickly infatuated, and the two began a relationship. By spring 1915, Taliesin II was completed and Noel moved there with Wright. Wright&#x27;s first wife Catherine finally granted him a divorce in 1922, meaning that Wright could marry Noel a year later. Although Wright admired Noel&#x27;s erratic personality at first, her behavior (later identified as schizophrenia) led to a miserable life together at Taliesin. Noel left Wright by the spring of 1924.

In the new Taliesin, Wright worked to repair his tarnished reputation. Already in 1916, he had secured a commission to design the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, Japan; when the building was undamaged following the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, Wright&#x27;s reputation was restored. Although he later expanded the agricultural wing, Wright spent little time at the second Taliesin house, often living near his construction sites abroad. Instead of serving as a full-time residence, Wright treated Taliesin like an art museum for his collection of Asian works. Wright only truly lived at Taliesin II starting in 1922, after his work at the Imperial Hotel was completed.

On April 20, 1925, Wright returned from eating dinner in the detached dining room when he noticed smoke billowing from his bedroom. By that time of night, most of the employees had returned home; only a driver and one apprentice were left in the complex. Unlike the first Taliesin fire, Wright was able to get help immediately. However, the fire quickly spread due to high winds. Despite the efforts of Wright and his neighbors to extinguish the flame, the living quarters of the second Taliesin were quickly destroyed. However, the workrooms where Wright kept his architectural drafts were spared. According to Wright&#x27;s autobiography, the fire appeared to have begun near a telephone in his bedroom. Wright also mentioned a lightning storm approaching immediately before noticing the fire. Wright scholars speculate that the storm may have caused an electrical surge through the telephone system, sparking the fire.

==Taliesin III==

Once again, the architect began rebuilding the living quarters of Taliesin. He also wrote about this in his 1932 autobiography, naming the house &quot;Taliesin III&quot;:Well—counselled [sic] by the living—there was I alive in their midst, key to a Taliesin nobler than the first if I could make it. And I had faith that I could build another Taliesin!

A few days later clearing away the debris to reconstruct I picked up partly calcined marble heads of the Tang-dynasty, fragments of the black basalt of the splendid Wei-stone, Sung soft-clay sculpture and gorgeous Ming pottery turned to the color of bronze by the intensity of the blaze. The sacrificial offerings to—whatever Gods may be.

And I put these fragments aside to weave them into the masonry—the fabric of Taliesin III that now—already in mind—was to stand in place of Taliesin II. And I went to work.

Wright was deeply in debt following the destruction of Taliesin II. Aside from debts owed on the property, his divorce from Noel forced Wright to sell much of his farm machinery and livestock. Wright was also forced to sell his prized Japanese prints at half value to pay his debts. The Bank of Wisconsin foreclosed on Taliesin in 1927 and Wright was forced to move to La Jolla, California. Shortly before the bank was to begin an auction on the property, Wright&#x27;s former client Darwin Martin conceived a scheme to save the property. He formed a company called Frank Lloyd Wright Incorporated to issue stock on Wright&#x27;s future earnings. Many of Wright&#x27;s former clients and students purchased stock in Wright to raise $70,000. The company successfully bid on Taliesin for $40,000, returning it to Wright. Wright returned to Taliesin by October 1928. Wright&#x27;s interaction with Taliesin lasted for the rest of his life, and eventually, he purchased the surrounding land, creating an estate of 593 acres (2.4 km²).
Some of Wright&#x27;s best-known buildings and most ambitious designs were created at his studio in the Taliesin III period. Works completed at Taliesin through the 1930s include Fallingwater (the house for Edgar Sr. and Liliane Kaufmann), the world headquarters for S.C. Johnson, and the first Usonian house for Herbert and Katherine Jacobs. After World War II, Wright moved his studio work in Wisconsin to the drafting studio at the Hillside Home School. After that, Wright used the studio at Taliesin for meeting with prospective apprentices and clients.

=== Architecture and layout ===
The modern-day Taliesin property is at 5481 County Road C in Wyoming, Iowa County, Wisconsin. All Wright buildings on the property have a combined , just short of , on of land. Through Wright&#x27;s lifetime, he and his apprentices continued to make changes to Taliesin III. but these modifications were never reflected in blueprints. Construction was handled mostly by Wright&#x27;s apprentices, who tended to be inexperienced, leaving cracks and gaps throughout the structure. Wright added several dams across the estate to create lakes. The presence of Taliesin also influenced the architecture of public buildings in the nearby town of Spring Green, which contain details influenced by Wright&#x27;s designs.

==== Main home ====
In its final form, the Taliesin III building measures . The current structure is the northernmost building in the complex and is arranged in the shape of the letter &quot;U&quot;, facing south-southwest. In contrast to Wright&#x27;s later work—which tended to incorporate curved forms—Taliesin III largely incorporates rectangular shapes in its design. Surrounding the main house are fountains, gardens, and courtyards, in a similar manner to the first two complexes. The house is accessed from a driveway that wraps around the hill, leading to the main courtyard. Water from one of the estate&#x27;s lakes is pumped upward into the courtyard, supplying the pools there; the courtyard also contains oak trees and a perimeter wall made of rock. One magazine wrote that the house &quot;emerges from the hillside like a natural outcropping, rooted in the earth&quot;.

Wright&#x27;s apprentices were responsible for much of the construction; they used recycled materials, as well as then-uncommon materials such as plywood, to construct much of the building. The facade is clad with limestone from the surrounding area. Wright mixed stucco with Wisconsin River sand to turn the walls into a yellowish color. The house is topped by intersecting hipped roofs with masonry chimneys. The house&#x27;s service wing, which wraps around one side of the hill, is the only part of the house that rise above the hill.

The interior is asymmetrical, and the rooms are not as formally organized as those of Wright&#x27;s later Prairie Houses; rather, the interior layout accommodated the site&#x27;s topography. Some of the spaces inside the house have ceilings measuring about high, slightly taller than Wright himself, who measured tall. Among the spaces with low ceilings is the vestibule, where Wright wanted to discourage people from loitering. The vestibule leads directly to the living room, which overlooks the Wisconsin River; the living room has large glass windows and a sloped ceiling. To the right of the living room is a &quot;birdwalk&quot;, which is cantilevered from the house. Wright&#x27;s own bedroom has a low ceiling with clerestory windows, as well as a sliding glass wall that opens onto a terrace. There is also a studio with a hipped ceiling and a stone fireplace. The other interior spaces include an office and a sitting room.

==== Other structures ====
The Hillside Home School, the southernmost building in the complex, is designed in the Prairie Style. It has a apprentices&#x27; drafting room. In addition, the Hillside Home School contains a theater with 100 seats. The modern Taliesin complex also includes the Midway Farm, constructed between 1938 and 1947. Though the site is no longer used as a farm, several of the Midway Farm buildings still exist, including a stone milk house, the Midway Barn, and several wooden structures. Wright&#x27;s sister&#x27;s house, Tan-y-Deri, is located up the hill from Midway Farm. Next to Tan-y-Deri is the octagonal Romeo and Juliet Windmill, a wooden structure measuring high. In addition, the Taliesin Dam is located near the complex&#x27;s entrance driveway, and there are various other houses across the grounds. Nearby is the Unity Chapel, where Wright would later be buried.

===Taliesin Fellowship===
Wright inherited the nearby Hillside Home School when it became insolvent in 1915 (the school had been run by his aunts, and the building was designed by him). In 1928, Wright conceived the idea of hosting a school there and issued a proposal to the University of Wisconsin that would have created the Hillside Home School for the Allied Arts; however, the plan was later abandoned. In 1932, the Wrights instead established the private Taliesin Fellowship, where fifty to sixty apprentices could come to Taliesin to study under the architect&#x27;s mentorship. Apprentices helped him develop the estate at a time when Wright received few commissions for his work, including the Hillside Home School building, renovating the original school gymnasium into a theater. Apprentices under Wright&#x27;s direction also constructed a drafting studio and dormitories. Notable fellows include Arthur Dyson, Fay Jones, Shao Fang Sheng, Paolo Soleri, Edgar Tafel, and Paul Tuttle.

In 1937, Wright designed and the apprentices began construction on a winter home in Scottsdale, Arizona, which became known as Taliesin West. After Taliesin West was completed, Wright and the fellowship &quot;migrated&quot; between the two homes each year, spending summers in Arizona and winters in Wisconsin.

Wright did not consider the fellowship a formal school, instead viewing it as a benevolent educational institution. He also worked to ensure G.I. Bill eligibility for returning World War II veterans. The town of Wyoming, Wisconsin, and Wright became embroiled in a legal dispute over his claim of tax exemption. A trial judge agreed with the town, stating that, since apprentices did much of Wright&#x27;s work, it was not solely a benevolent institution. Wright fought the case to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. When Wright lost the case there in 1954, he threatened to abandon the estate. However, he was persuaded to stay after some friends raised $800,000 to cover the back taxes at a benefit dinner. The Taliesin Fellowship evolved into The School of Architecture.

==Preservation==
In 1940, Frank Lloyd Wright, his third wife Olgivanna, and his son-in-law William Wesley Peters formed the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. Wright added a third story above the second-story bedrooms and first-story living spaces in 1943, though this ended up weakening the original house&#x27;s frame. The Hillside School building caught fire in April 1952, and the theater and dining room in that building were subsequently rebuilt. Upon Wright&#x27;s death on April 9, 1959, he was buried next to the Unity Chapel in the Lloyd-Jones cemetery near Taliesin; his body remained there until 1985, when it was moved to Taliesin West. Ownership of the Taliesin estate in Spring Green, as well as Taliesin West, was conveyed to the foundation. The Taliesin Fellowship continued to use the Hillside School as The School of Architecture at Taliesin. The fellowship allowed tours of the school, but initially did not permit visitation of the house or other grounds.

When the group spent two summers in Switzerland, rumors started that they were planning on selling the house to S. C. Johnson, a former Wright client. Instead, the fellowship sold a surrounding piece of land to a developer associated with the company, intending to develop a tourist complex. The resort included an eighteen-hole golf course, restaurant, and a visitor center.

===Landmark designations===

In 1973, the Taliesin estate was listed in the National Register of Historic Places and in 1976, it was recognized as a National Historic Landmark (NHL) District by the National Park Service. A National Historic Landmark is a site deemed to have &quot;exceptional value to the nation.&quot; The properties contributing to the district are the landscape, Taliesin III, the pool and gardens in the courtyard, Hillside Home School (which includes the Hillside drafting studio and the theater), the dam, Romeo and Juliet Windmill, Midway Barn, and Tan-y-Deri.

In the late 1980s, Taliesin and Taliesin West were jointly nominated as a World Heritage Site, a UNESCO designation for properties with special worldwide significance. The federal government endorsed the nomination, but UNESCO rejected it because the organization wanted to see a larger nomination with more Wright properties. In 2008, the National Park Service submitted the Taliesin estate along with nine other Frank Lloyd Wright properties to a tentative list for World Heritage Status, which the National Park Service says is &quot;a necessary first step in the process of nominating a site to the World Heritage List.&quot; The United States Department of the Interior again nominated the Taliesin estate to UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage List in 2015, alongside nine other buildings. UNESCO ultimately added eight properties, including Taliesin, to the World Heritage List in July 2019 under the title &quot;The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;. &quot;Wisconsin Public Radio&quot; wrote that the World Heritage designation was &quot;a triumph for Wisconsin&quot;, as two of the eight properties were located in the state.
===Rehabilitation===
==== 1970s and 1980s ====
By the late 20th century, Taliesin had become dilapidated in spite of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation&#x27;s efforts to maintain it. With the NHL designation, the organization had received $300,000 in federal funds to help maintain the property. However, the organization needed another $2.5 million to rehabilitate the estate by the early 1980s. At the time, the organization barely had enough money for regular maintenance of Taliesin and Taliesin West, let alone long-term repairs. Furthermore, the house had been damaged during an electrical fire in 1975. Some parts of the property, such as the Romeo and Juliet Windmill, were in even worse condition than the main house.

The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation conducted some repairs to the building in the 1980s. These included injecting concrete into the soil to prevent the house&#x27;s foundation from settling, re-plastering the walls, adding a foam covering to the roof, and insulating the ceilings. Though the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation still occupied the estate seasonally, Taliesin was closed to the public. In 1983, the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation began selling off the contents of Wright&#x27;s archives to raise money for a $20 million endowment fund to restore the estate. These sales were controversial, with opponents objecting to the dispersal of Wright&#x27;s documents. During that time, all the buildings except for the Hillside Home School were typically closed to the public. 

In 1987, the National Park Service evaluated the 1,811 NHLs nationwide for historical integrity and threat of damage. Taliesin was declared a &quot;Priority 1&quot; NHL, a site that is &quot;seriously damaged or imminently with such damage&quot;. The main building was in poor shape, with cracking plaster, sinking foundations, and rotting wood. Some of the wooden floors had warped, and the birdwalk had developed a large crack. The other buildings at Taliesin were in similarly poor condition, having weathered over the years. There was no heating system, and many parts of the complex were exposed to moisture and extreme heat. The National Trust for Historic Preservation also listed the site as one of America&#x27;s Most Endangered Places due to &quot;water damage, erosion, foundation settlement and wood decay&quot;. Many of these structural issues were attributed to the haphazard, experimental nature of Taliesin&#x27;s construction, which had been described as resembling a &quot;stage set&quot;. Richard Carney, who led the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, began raising $10–20 million for repairs to both Taliesins.

==== 1990s: Initial work ====

Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson appointed a commission in 1988 to prepare plans for preserving and operating Taliesin; the commission estimated that it would cost $14.7 million to repair the complex. Thompson established Taliesin Preservation, Inc. (TPI), a non-profit organization, in 1990 to restore Taliesin. The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation retained ownership of the complex, working with TPI to preserve the property. TPI received $150,000 from the state government, a $50,000 matching grant from the J. Paul Getty Trust, and a $100,000 grant from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. The Taliesin complex began hosting tours in mid-1992. Thompson suggested in late 1992 that the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) fund the house&#x27;s restoration with an $8 million bond issue. Thompson estimated that the complex could attract up to 150,000 visitors annually, generating more than $10 million in tourist spending in Wisconsin. WHEDA approved a loan for the complex later the same year. In addition, TPI suggested spending $3.8 million on a visitor center. TPI&#x27;s executive director Robert Burley drew up plans for Taliesin&#x27;s restoration. By the mid-1990s, the renovation was expected to cost an estimated $24 million. 

Early restoration work included repairs to the foundation, remediation of fire hazards, and emergency repairs to other parts of the house. U.S. senator Herb Kohl introduced a bill in July 1993 to provide another $8 million for Taliesin&#x27;s restoration. Kohl and U.S. representative Scott Klug also cosponsored legislation to convert Taliesin into a National Park Service site, though the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation would have continued to own the complex. TPI also sought to raise the final $8 million for the restoration from donations. The first part of Taliesin to be restored, the terrace outside Wright&#x27;s bedroom and study, was finished that October. Workers also shored up parts of the complex that were in danger of collapsing. The same year, due to the deterioration of the Taliesin Dam, Wisconsin officials asked the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation to either repair or abandon it. TPI also bought the Wright–designed Riverview Terrace Restaurant nearby and converted it into a visitor center. The commission held an architectural design competition for the visitor center, and it selected Tony Puttnam to redesign the structure, which opened in June 1994. By then, TPI had raised $1 million from donations. Work continued on Taliesin&#x27;s restoration during the 1990s, even while it was open to visitors.

Following a severe storm on June 18, 1998, a large oak tree in the courtyard fell down on top of the house. The tree had been the last survivor of three that Wright had planted there in 1911, and its collapse caused $1 million in damage. Ten days afterward, heavy rains caused a mudslide near the main building, exposing a structural support underneath a balcony. Following these incidents, workers made emergency repairs to the house and repaired damaged interiors and windows. By the late 1990s, the complex had about 50,000 visitors per year, far fewer than the 200,000 annual visitors TPI had anticipated. Additionally, TPI earned only about $1 million a year from tourism, which was not enough to repay the WHEDA loan, and TPI missed a $6.5 million payment on the loan in January 1999. The Wisconsin government ended up forgiving most of the loan. That May, the federal government agreed to give Taliesin a $1.15 million matching grant from Save America&#x27;s Treasures on the condition that TPI raise an equal amount. This funding would be used for interior restoration and drainage repairs. The same year, TPI began soliciting donations to restore the grounds as part of the Trees for Taliesin program, and publishing executive Frank Anton announced plans to raise $25 million for the renovation through the Taliesin Restoration Project. At the time, there were plans to repair the studio wing and Tan-y-Deri. Another storm in late 1999 collapsed a tunnel underneath the studio wing.

==== 21st century ====

According to the &quot;Wisconsin State Journal&quot;, Taliesin&#x27;s preservation was &quot;fraught with epic difficulties&quot;, because Wright never thought of it as a series of buildings with a long-term future. The studio wing&#x27;s restoration was completed in August 2000 at a cost of $400,000, three-fourths of which was covered from insurance payouts; private donors paid the rest of the cost. By 2002, the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation estimated that it might cost up to $60 million to refurbish the Taliesin complex. At the time, workers were about to stabilize the hill under the house, as the hillside was causing Taliesin&#x27;s walls to slant and its walkways to crack. To prevent further water damage, tarpaulins had been placed on the ground as an emergency measure. TPI had issues raising money due to a weakening of the local economy, and many of the complex&#x27;s structural issues were not readily visible to the public, posing further fundraising difficulties. Preservationists predicted that the estate would be irreversibly damaged if it were not repaired within five to ten years.

A $900,000 project to improve Taliesin&#x27;s drainage system was completed in 2004. The cost of the restoration had increased to $67 million by 2005, of which the main house alone was estimated to cost $26 million. The same year, businessman T. Denny Sanford donated $425,000 for Taliesin&#x27;s restoration. These funds, which were matched by part of the Save America&#x27;s Treasures grant, were used to pay for further repairs to the roof, as well as planning for future repairs. There were also plans to replace a bridge carrying Taliesin&#x27;s driveway across a creek. In 2006, the Jeffris Family Foundation agreed to fund 25% of Tan-y-Deri&#x27;s restoration, which at the time was estimated to cost $828,000. Over $11 million was spent on the rehabilitation of Taliesin between 1988 and 2008. Financing renovations was stull challenging because of lower-than expected attendance. The &quot;Wisconsin State Journal&quot; reported in 2009 that, despite increased attendance over the preceding two years, TPI still needed to raise $50 million to restore the rest of the complex. TPI also began reinforcing the house&#x27;s structure, which had been undermined by the weight of the third-story guestrooms. The World Monuments Fund (WMF) added Taliesin to its 2010 World Monuments Watch to bring attention to the complex&#x27;s remaining structural issues.

By the early 2010s, workers had begun repairing the house&#x27;s foundation and lower level. The house was still open to the public, albeit only for guided tours; there were eight separate kinds of tours because of Taliesin&#x27;s wide-ranging history and scope. To celebrate Taliesin&#x27;s centennial, TPI hosted a series of events in 2011. The complex remained in danger of deterioration, prompting the WMF to add Taliesin to its 2014 World Monuments Watch. In the mid-2010s, preservationists also began restoring Taliesin&#x27;s gardens to their 1959 appearance. This project included adding hollyhocks and rearranging orchards to Wright&#x27;s original specifications. Additionally, to attract visitors to Taliesin and other Wright–designed sites in Wisconsin, state legislators proposed giving money to the Wisconsin Department of Tourism for the installation of road signs promoting these sites. Taliesin was subsequently included on the Frank Lloyd Wright Trail, which was established in 2017.

In 2018, Taliesin received a $320,000 grant for the Hillside theater&#x27;s restoration through the Save America&#x27;s Treasures program; the project included improving drainage, upgrading mechanical systems, and adding rooms to the basement. This project was initially planned to cost $867,000 and take two years. The theater did not reopen until 2024, and its renovation ultimately cost $1.1 million. Workers also restored Taliesin&#x27;s Midway Barn in the 2020s. 

=== Visitation ===
TPI provides tours from May 1 through October 31 of each year, though weekend tours of the grounds are also available in April and November. Other events and programs are available sporadically through the rest of the year. Tours of the house&#x27;s interior are usually not given from November to April because Taliesin has no heating system; Wright had removed Taliesin&#x27;s furnaces after his Taliesin West complex was completed. In addition, visitors are not ordinarily allowed to stay at the complex overnight. , more than 25,000 people visit Taliesin each year. The Wisconsin Historical Society&#x27;s collections include rare old photographs of Taliesin.

== Reception ==
Architectural historian James F. O&#x27;Gorman compares Taliesin to Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello, calling it &quot;not a mere building but an entire environment in which man, architecture and nature form a harmonious whole.&quot; He continues that the building is an expression of Romanticism influence in architecture. William Barillas, in an essay of the Prairie School movement, agrees with O&#x27;Gorman&#x27;s assessment and calls Taliesin &quot;the ultimate prairie house.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote in 1985 that, even though the Taliesin complex was not Wright&#x27;s most elaborate or expensive design, they are still compelling statements about shelter and about nature&quot;.

Robert Cross wrote for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 2001 that &quot;Everywhere—parlor, bedrooms, garden terraces—the eye falls on beauty. The outside comes in through the windows with gorgeous effect.&quot; In a 2009 publication for the Thoreau Society, Naomi Uechi notes thematic similarities between the architecture of Taliesin and the concept of simplicity advocated by philosopher Henry David Thoreau. Architectural historian Neil Levine highlighted the abstract nature of the complex, comparing it to the works of Pablo Picasso. In &quot;House Proud&quot;, an article in &quot;Boston Globe Magazine&quot; by the Pulitzer Prize–winning architecture critic Robert Campbell, Taliesin was described as &quot;my candidate for the title of the greatest single building in America.&quot; Another writer, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said of Taliesin that &quot;the key idea is horizontality&quot;, contrasting with the vertical design elements of skyscrapers that were being built at the same time.

Several sources have described Taliesin as an embodiment of Wright and his architectural philosophy. In &quot;Taliesin 1911–1914&quot;, a collection of essays about the first house, the authors and editor conclude that Taliesin was &quot;Wright&#x27;s architectural self-portrait.&quot; Paul Goldberger, the architectural critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, similarly wrote in 1994 that &quot;there is no better way into the soul of Frank Lloyd Wright than to tour this house&quot;. The &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; wrote the next year that the complex&#x27;s design provided insight into &quot;the career of a man who reinvented the language of architecture&quot;. TPI&#x27;s president Carol McChesney Johnson said in 2011 that Taliesin &quot;was a part of who he was&quot;, in contrast to other buildings that he designed but did not occupy. The following year, a writer for the &quot;Wisconsin Magazine of History&quot; described Taliesin as &quot;a quintessential example of how architectural history and biography can blend into a single entity&quot;. A writer for &quot;Madison&quot; magazine wrote in 2024 that &quot;trees growing into and out of the structure, moss-covered stones and ramshackle facades&quot; at Taliesin were in keeping with Wright&#x27;s experimental nature and love of organic architecture, but that the estate was hard to maintain as a result.

<text>Mitzi Kapture (born Mitzi Gaynor Donahue; May 2, 1962) is an American actress, known for her role as Sgt. Rita Lee Lance in the CBS/USA Network crime drama series &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot; from 1991 to 1995.

==Life and career==

Kapture was born in Yorba Linda, California, and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. After appearing as a contestant on $100,000 Pyramid, she began her career in films such as &quot;Lethal Pursuit&quot; (1988), &quot;Angel III: The Final Chapter&quot; (1988), &quot;Liberty &amp; Bash&quot; (1989), and &quot;The Vagrant&quot; (1992), before moving to television. She gained exposure with her first regular series role as Sergeant Rita Lee Lance in the television series &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;. &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot; premiered on CBS and USA, but later moved solely to USA Network. The show aired for eight seasons and became USA network&#x27;s highest-rated original drama series. She played Rita, the other half of the two &quot;Sams&quot; for almost five years. Paired with Rob Estes, who played Sergeant Chris Lorenzo, Kapture gained recognition along with her co-star. Sergeant Lance eventually became Lieutenant Lance by the time Kapture left the series in 1995 to have her first daughter. During her time with the series, Kapture also directed episodes.

Kapture returned to television in 1997, starring in two made-for-USA-Network movies. She played lead roles in USA Pictures Originals telemovies, &quot;Perfect Crime&quot; (based on a true story, also called &quot;Hide and Seek: The Joanne Jensen Story&quot;), which also starred Jasmine Guy, and &quot;His Bodyguard&quot; with Robert Guillaume. She returned to series television in a lead role on &quot;Baywatch&quot; as Alexis Ryker.

From 2002 through 2005, she played the seductive Anita Hodges on the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, credited as Mitzi Kapture Donahue. She also starred in the made-for-Lifetime television movie &quot;Night of Terror&quot;, which premiered March 26, 2007. In her latest film, she played the role of a therapist specializing in autism in the independent feature &quot;God&#x27;s Ears&quot;, released in 2008 and on DVD in 2012.
In 2010, she guest-starred in an episode of the CBS sitcom &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;.

<doc id="1228453" wikidata="Q1043500" url="?curid=1228453" title="Carmagnole">
<text>&quot;La Carmagnole&quot; is the title of a French song created and made popular during the French Revolution, accompanied by a wild dance of the same name that may have also been brought into France by the Piedmontese. It was first sung in August 1792 and was successively added to during the revolutionary events of 1830, 1848, 1863–64, and 1882-83. The authors are not known. The title refers to the short jacket worn by working-class militant &quot;sans-culottes,&quot; adopted from the Piedmontese peasant costume named for the town of Carmagnola.

It sarcastically sings of the triumphs over the Queen of France, Marie Antoinette (Madame Veto), King Louis XVI (Monsieur Veto), and the French monarchists in general.

==History==

There are varied accounts of the song and where it was sung. It was mainly a rallying cry or entertainment for revolutionaries. It was also used to insult opponents of the French Revolution. A popular punishment was to make anti-revolutionaries &quot;sing and dance the Carmagnole&quot;, which could be done to marquises, dames, princes, monks, bishops, archbishops, cardinals and the like. La Carmagnole has also been documented as a battle cry. At the battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792 it is written that, &quot;the sans-culottes in the army rushed the enemy singing &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and &quot;La Carmagnole.&quot; It was a great republican victory, and all of Belgium fell to the revolutionary armies.&quot;

When not sung during an actual battle, the Carmagnole was often sung after political or military victories. One such event occurred after the storming of the Tuileries Palace on the night of August 9–10, 1792. The radical people of Paris asserted their power by forcing the king to flee to the nearby National Assembly. After storming the palace and massacring the King&#x27;s personal Swiss Guard, the mob of Paris was &quot;drunk with blood, danced and sang the Carmagnole to celebrate the victory.&quot; The song was also more generally associated with grassroots popular displays, such as festivals or the planting of liberty trees. It was common to include public singing at these symbolic events, and over the course of the Revolution &quot;some 60,000 liberty trees were planted&quot; giving the people many opportunities to sing.

==Importance==
Song was a very important means of expression in France during the Revolution. The Marseillaise, which has since become the French National Anthem, was written during this period. It has been written that, &quot;Frenchmen took pride in their habit of singing and regarded it as one source of their success.&quot; In France, heroism was linked to gaiety. In the preface to the Chansonnier de la République there are questions that the French Republic poses to the world: &quot;What will the ferocious reactionaries, who accuse France of unity, say when they see them equal to the heroes of antiquity in singing the Carmagnole? What will they say when they hear on the battlefields of the republicans these patriotic refrains, which precede and follow the most bloody combats?&quot; La Carmagnole, and revolutionary song in general, was viewed as an important part of the new French Republic, and of being a Frenchman. La Carmagnole was particularly popular because, like the song Ah! ça ira (&quot;It&#x27;ll do&quot;, &quot;Everything will be OK&quot;), it contained simple lyrics that illiterate people could easily learn and understand, and therefore participate in singing.

==Literary references==
The Carmagnole is mentioned in &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; by Charles Dickens, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; by Baroness Orczy and plays an important role in &quot;The Song at the Scaffold&quot;, a novella written by Gertrud von Le Fort. La Carmagnole is also sung by the chorus in Act III of Umberto Giordano&#x27;s opera &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;, and it is sung in the closing dialogue of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;. Carl Schurz, in , reports from exile in England that upon Napoleon III&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 2 December 1851, &quot;Our French friends shouted and shrieked and gesticulated and hurled opprobrious names at Louis Napoleon and cursed his helpers, and danced the Carmagnole and sang &#x27;Ça Ira.&#x27;&quot; In &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Victor Hugo contrasts it to the Marseillaise, writing &quot;With just the ′&quot;Carmagnole&quot;′ to sing [a Parisian] will only overthrow Louis XVI; but give him the ′&quot;Marseillaise&quot;′ and he will liberate the world.&quot; It is also mentioned in Chapter 37 of Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot;. In the first volume of John Dos Passos&#x27;s U.S.A. Trilogy, &quot;42nd Parallel&quot; a group of revolutionary workers in Mexico sing the Carmagnole when an American radical visits them.

In the Greek island of Samos, then under Ottoman rule, the &quot;Carmagnole&quot; gave its name to the political faction of the &quot;Karmanioloi&quot;, who, inspired by the French Revolution&#x27;s liberal and democratic ideals, opposed the traditional, reactionary land-holding notables (nicknamed &quot;Kallikantzaroi&quot;). The struggle of the two parties dominated the political affairs of the island in the years leading up to the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, when the &quot;Karmanioloi&quot; faction led Samos to join the uprising.

<text>Guy Richard Goronwy Edwards, QGM (born 30 December 1942) is a British former racing driver. Best known for his sportscar and British Formula One career, as well as for brokering sponsorship deals, Edwards participated in 17 World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 13 January 1974. He scored no championship points.

==Early life==
Edwards attended Liverpool College and studied at Durham University (), graduating in 1964.

With aspirations of racing cars he went straight from university to Brands Hatch Racing School and persuaded the owner to allow him to perform secretarial work in exchange for 10 free laps a week in circuit cars. After saving up money he was able to purchase a Mini Cooper-S, with which he gained his first competitive experience. Edwards upgraded to a Chevron B8 once he gained sponsorship and soon entered Formula 5000.

==Career==

Edwards competed in the Aurora Formula One Championship in the UK from 1978 to 1980, scoring several wins driving March, Fittipaldi and Arrows chassis. In 1979, he scored the only race win for a Fittipaldi Formula One chassis.

He is also renowned for being one of the drivers, along with Arturo Merzario, Brett Lunger and Harald Ertl, who saved Niki Lauda from his burning car during the 1976 German Grand Prix, for which he was later awarded a Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal for his bravery. Currently, he works helping racing drivers to get sponsorship.

His son Sean, also a racing driver, was killed in a motor racing accident at Queensland Raceway in Australia on 15 October 2013. He was sitting as a passenger in a Porsche 911 GT3 to coach a younger driver when they had a high-speed crash and subsequently caught fire.

In October 2018, media erroneously reported him dead.

<text>Otterbourne is a village in Hampshire, England. It is located approximately south of Winchester and north of Southampton. At the 2011 census, its population was 1,539, and there were 626 dwellings.

There are three public houses in the village: the &quot;White Horse Inn&quot;, the &quot;Otter&quot;, and the &quot;Old Forge&quot;. There is also a school, a post office and village shop. Before the 21st century, the post office and village shop were located opposite Cranbourne Drive at the bottom of Otterbourne Hill. However, at the end of the 1990s, the car garage at the centre of the village was rebuilt to include a petrol station and convenience store. It has subsequently been taken over by Nisa Local convenience store, and the petrol station has been decommissioned. In the early hours of 30 November 2015, William&#x27;s Garage beside Budgens suffered from a fire.

The Otterbourne Brass, performs in Otterbourne Village Hall every Christmas and concerts in and around the surrounding area. The band also competes in the 1st Section of the National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain.

Famous people from Otterbourne include Chris Tremlett who plays cricket for England and Surrey and novelist Charlotte Mary Yonge.

==History==
The village of Otterbourne, on the stream Otter Bourne, lies on the old Roman road between &quot;Venta Belgarum&quot; (Winchester) and &quot;Clausentum&quot; (Southampton). It appears in the Domesday Book as Otrebourne. The physicist Sir Isaac Newton lodged at Cranbury House in his twilight years, and John Keble, a leader of the Oxford Movement, settled down as vicar of the parish church, St Matthew&#x27;s, around 1838.

At that time, Otterbourne&#x27;s novelist Charlotte Mary Yonge (1823–1901) was 15 years old; her writings were influenced by Keble&#x27;s sermons. In her day, she was a major celebrity, publishing more than 100 novels.

Already by 1840, however, the London to Southampton railway opened (later the South West Main Line), passing by the village. Within half a century, old Otterbourne had been abandoned, and the village moved half a mile east to its present location.

Charlotte Yonge lived the second half of her life in a house named Elderfield, which between 1959 and 2019 was a Residential Training Centre for former offenders run by the Langley House Trust, a registered charity. On 17 August 2005, resident Anthony Rice murdered Naomi Bryant at her home in Winchester, prompting an independent review (pdf) of his case by HM Inspectorate of Probation.

==Waterworks==

Prior to the centralisation of its regional offices, Otterbourne was home to the Hampshire headquarters of Southern Water. The 1980s office building (part of which was leased to the Audit Commission) is situated on the site of a large water supply works, which takes water from the River Itchen and a number of boreholes. Otterbourne water supply works feeds a covered reservoir in the village, which in turn supplies most of the eastern side of Southampton. Water is also pumped to a covered reservoir at Yew Hill in Olivers Battery Community Parish.


Following Southern Water&#x27;s £20.3 million fine for &#x27;deliberate misreporting&#x27; and failing to meet guaranteed standards of service to customers in 2007, the company shut down its use of the Otterbourne building and leased it to two NHS organisations; South Central Ambulance Service and Health Education Wessex.

==Church==
The village church is dedicated to Saint Matthew. It was built over two years from 1837 to a design by Owen Browne Carter and William Crawley Yonge. Some the internal fittings are older than the church including a carved panel on the pulpit dating from the 15th century.

==Notable people==
* Charlotte Mary Yonge (1823–1901), was an English novelist
* Jim Bailey (1908–1988), first-class cricketer
* Chris Tremlett (cricketer) (1981–still alive), first-class cricketer

<text>Polish plait (Latin: &quot;Plica polonica&quot;, or &quot;plika&quot;, &quot;Kołtun&quot; in Polish meaning matted), less commonly known in English as plica or trichoma, is a particular formation of hair. This term can refer to either a hairstyle or a medical condition, depending on context. The term is connected to a system of beliefs in European folklore, and healing practices in traditional medicine in medieval Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth that believed matted hair was an amulet, or a catchment or trajectory for illness to leave the body.

==As a hairstyle==
Larry Wolff in his book &quot;Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the Mind of Enlightenment&quot; mentions that in Poland, for about a thousand years, some people wore the hair style of the Scythians. Zygmunt Gloger in his &quot;Encyklopedia staropolska&quot; mentions that Polish plait was worn as a hair style by some people, regardless of gender, in the Pinsk region and the Masovia region at the beginning of the 19th century. He used the term &quot;kołtun zapuszczony&quot; which denotes artificial formation of Polish plait. According to folklore studies today, the style was formed using liquids or wax. Among liquids, a mixture of wine and sugar was used or washing hair daily with water in which herbs were boiled. The most commonly used herb was vinca (&quot;Vinca major&quot;), followed by &quot;Lycopodium clavatum&quot; and moss, which caused hair to mat. A similar effect can be had by rubbing hair with wax, or inserting a piece of a candle at the hair ends. Newer Polish dictionaries mention &quot;plica&quot; as a disease, but the old ones also mention artificially created plica.

In modern times the hairstyle is also known as mono-dreadlock (or mono-dread for short), alluding to how its structure is comparable to a single, massive strand of a dreadlock hairstyle, as well as beaver tail as the mass of hair may resemble the tail of a beaver. The hairstyle can vary in size, from large beaver tails to small plaits. 

==History==
The Polish plait was quite common in Europe during past centuries when hair grooming was largely neglected. It affected mostly the peasantry, but was not unusual among higher social classes.

Due to superstitious beliefs, the Polish plait used to be particularly common in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, hence its English and Latin name. Similarly, in German it is called &quot;Weichselzopf&quot;, or Vistula braid, &quot;zopf&quot; meaning a braid, and the &quot;Vistula&quot; being a river in Poland. Initially, the plait was considered an amulet to keep illness away from the body, as it was believed that when disease resolved it left the body to live in the hair, resulting in lessened suffering. For this reason, people not only allowed it to develop, but even encouraged it. According to M. Marczewska, who researched the subject from the perspective of folklore studies, animistic beliefs and long-held pagan beliefs relating to illness viewed illness as caused by an invading evil spirit, which by convalescence left the body and was less problematic when living in the hair formation, which was then shed naturally or cut and ritualistically disposed of by persons specializing in folk medicine or practitioners of folk magic. As people believed that the formation of plica was a sign of resolving of disease, plica, as a hairstyle, was also formed artificially by washing with mixtures of herbs, sweetened wine, waxing, etc.

In the early 17th century, people began to believe plaits were an external symptom of an internal illness. A growing plait was supposed to take the illness &quot;out&quot; of the body, and therefore it was rarely cut off; in addition, the belief that a cut-off plait could avenge itself and bring an even greater illness discouraged some from attacking it. It was also believed that casting a magic spell on someone could cause that person to develop a Polish plait, hence also the name was used in English, also &quot;Hexenzopf&quot; (witches&#x27; plait) in German.

These convictions were so widespread and strong that some people lived their whole lives with a Polish plait. A plait could sometimes grow very long – even up to . Polish plaits could take various forms, from a ball of hair to a long tail. Plaits were even categorized; plaits were &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;, &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot;, &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;fake&quot;, &quot;proper&quot; and &quot;parasitical&quot;.

British diarist Hester Thrale, in her book &quot;Observations and Reflections Made in the Course of a Journey through France, Italy, and Germany&quot;, described a Polish plait she saw in 1786 in the collection of the Elector of Saxony in Dresden: &quot;the size and weight of it was enormous, its length four yards and a half [about 4.1 m]; the person who was killed by its growth was a Polish lady of quality well known in King Augustus&#x27;s court.&quot;

During the Age of Enlightenment, it became common to use the terms &quot;plica polonica&quot; (Polish plait) and &quot;plica judaica&quot; (Jewish plait), as well as the term &quot;Polish ringworm&quot; in English. In addition to antisemitism, there was also prejudice against Eastern Europeans. According to Larry Wolff&#x27;s book &quot;The Invention of Eastern Europe&quot;, Poles were considered &quot;semi-Asians&quot;, the descendants of Tatars and barbarians. Maurice Fishberg in his book &quot;The Jews: A Study of Race and Environment&quot; mentions both terms. It was a common belief that plica was a contagious disease which originated in Poland after the Mongol invasion and later spread to other countries. Diderot wrote in his &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; (due to his misunderstanding of Martin Cromer&#x27;s text) that the Tatar invasion of Poland was the source of plica. An example of the belief in the spread of plica as a contagious disease by foreign hosts was the Victorian-era British belief that the plica was spread like a disease by Polish traders in artificial hair. George Lefevre, in his book &quot;An Apology for the Nerves&quot; (1844), mentions the terms &quot;plica polonica&quot; and &quot;plica judaica&quot; and also debunks the popular belief that wearing the Polish national costume could cause plica in the wearer. He describes the case of a woman in Berlin who did not wear the Polish national costume, yet was affected with plica. He concluded, &quot;Neither, therefore, are strangers free from it, nor is produced by dress alone.&quot;

Zygmunt Gloger in his &quot;&quot; argued that according to research done by the Grimm Brothers and Rosenbaum, &quot;plica polonica&quot; and the idea that it spread from Poland was an error, as it was also found among the Germanic population of Bavaria and Rhine River area. He said that the word &quot;weichselzopf&quot; (Vistula plait) was a later alteration of the name &quot;wichtelzopf&quot; (plait of a wight); &quot;wichtel&quot; means wight in German, a being or sentient thing.

In the second half of the 19th century, some medical professionals waged a war against superstition and lack of hygiene among the peasantry, and traditional folk medicine. Many plaits, often to the horror of their owners, were cut off. In Western Galicia, Professor Józef Dietl made a particular effort to examine and treat Polish plaits. He was also a politician, and his methods of dealing with persons with plicas are controversial today: he organized an official census of people suffering from the disease, they were not allowed to receive help by charitable organizations, were forbidden entrance to some buildings such as schools and offices, and he also proposed fines, which spawned rumors that plaits would be taxed. Those practices were said to have helped eradicate the Polish plait in the region. A huge 1.5-meter long plica can be seen preserved in the Museum of the Faculty of Medicine of Jagiellonian University Medical College in Kraków. In the areas of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth which were occupied by the Russian Empire, young men with plica were exempt from service in the tsarist army. It is unknown how many plicas were natural or how many were man-made dreadlocks. The Polish word for the Polish plait, &quot;kołtun&quot;, is now used figuratively in Poland to denote an uneducated person with an old-fashioned mindset.

==In folklore==
Plica was believed to be caused by supernatural entities. The names often describe the believed cause of tangled hair. In Britain this condition was believed to be caused by elves, hence the name &quot;elflock&quot; (mentioned in Shakespearean poetry and folk tales), although this term could refer to tangles much milder than a Polish plait. Folk belief in Germany associated it with witches or wights (Hexen or Wichtel) giving plica the names Hexenzopf or Wichtelzopf; in Poland, the cause was an unclean spirit. One of the names of plica in Polish was wieszczyca, &quot;wieszcz&quot; means bard, specifically, a folk poet with the gift of prophesy or a vampire-like living person. In German folklore, plica appears in one of the Brothers Grimm&#x27;s fairy tales, in which a girl doesn&#x27;t comb her hair for one year and finds golden coins in her plica.

Many illnesses were associated with plica and were synonymous with the folk name for this condition. According to Marczewska, about thirty diseases were associated with plica in Polish folklore. In German and Bohemian spells, there are as many as seventy diseases. Poles were afraid to upset the unclean spirit, and, to pacify it, inserted offerings such as coins into the plica. Kołtun (or &quot;gościec&quot;, its Polish folk name) did not necessarily describe only the hair formation, it also described the bodily illness without the presence of tangled hair. Pain (especially in joints), rheumatism, etc. were synonymous with it. If plica was present, it was blamed for whims and cravings, which needed to be satisfied promptly; people around a person with plica needed to assist the sufferer to comply with the cravings. Marczewska points out that one old Polish dictionary stated that kołtun created strong cravings, especially for wine (which was imported and expensive).

<text>Lorne John &quot;Gump&quot; Worsley (May 14, 1929 – January 26, 2007) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. Born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, &#x27;Gump&#x27; was given his nickname because friends thought he looked like comic-strip character Andy Gump.

==Career==
Worsley played his first four years as a professional in the minor leagues, most notably for the New York Rovers of the Eastern Hockey League (EHL), the St. Paul Saints of the United States Hockey League (USHL), and the Saskatoon Quakers of the Western Hockey League (WHL). Between 1950 and 1952 he was named to the First All-Star Team three times and led the league in goaltending.

In the fall of 1952 he was signed by the New York Rangers of the NHL. Although he played for a last-place team, he won the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year. However, after asking for a pay increase of $500 a year, he was sent back down to the minor leagues the following season. In 1953-54, playing for the Vancouver Canucks of the WHL, he won the league&#x27;s most valuable player award.

In 1954-55, Worsley returned to the Rangers, replacing Johnny Bower. He toiled for the Rangers for the next nine seasons, generally playing well for a poor team. In the 1955–56 New York Rangers season opener against the Chicago Blackhawks, Worsley made 43 saves, setting a franchise record.

In the summer of 1963, Worsley became involved in the establishment of a players&#x27; union, and the Rangers promptly traded him to the Montreal Canadiens. He spent much of the next two seasons in the American Hockey League with the Quebec Aces and was named to the AHL&#x27;s First All-Star Team in 1964. Returning to the NHL, Worsley played his best years for the Canadiens as the team won the Stanley Cup in 1965, 1966, 1968 and 1969. His best season was 1968, when he won the Vezina Trophy, attained a goals-against average of 1.98 — the lowest in his career — and earned eleven straight wins in the playoffs. In 1969–70, however, he had a dispute with general manager Sam Pollock over being demoted to the minors, and head coach Claude Ruel&#x27;s decision to favor Rogatien Vachon made Worsley quit in the middle of the season. Pollock suggested Worsley accept a two-week conditioning stint to work his way back to the Canadiens, but the veteran netminder refused. Worsley was suspended for not reporting to the Canadiens&#x27; Montreal Voyageurs farm team and told Pollock he intended to retire.

Later in the season, however, the Minnesota North Stars expressed interest in Worsley, and the Canadiens traded him for future considerations. He starred with Minnesota for most of the following five years; his best season with the team was 1972, when he came second in the league with a 2.12 goals-against average and was named to play in the 25th National Hockey League All-Star Game. He retired after the 1973–74 season at the age of 44. Worsley was the second goaltender to win 300 games and lose 300 games, after Harry Lumley. 

Worsley was known for his wry sense of humour and various eccentricities. Early in his career with the lacklustre Rangers, regularly facing 40 to 50 shots a night, he was asked: &quot;Which team gives you the most trouble?&quot; His reply: &quot;The New York Rangers.&quot; Accused by Rangers&#x27; coach Phil Watson of having a beer belly, he replied, &quot;Just goes to show you what he knows. I only drink Johnnie Walker Red.&quot;

Worsley refused to wear a mask long after almost all other goaltenders adopted one. He was the second-to-last professional hockey goaltender to play without a mask; Andy Brown of the WHA&#x27;s Indianapolis Racers was the last. Worsley finally put one on in the last six games of his career. Asked why he never wore a mask, Worsley told reporters: &quot;My face &quot;is&quot; my mask.&quot;

Worsley was also well known for his fear of flying. On November 25, 1968, en route to Los Angeles, he suffered a nervous breakdown after a rough flight from Montreal&#x27;s Dorval Airport to Chicago. It has been reported that a stewardess upon landing came over the PA system and said that if passengers wished to claim refunds for drycleaning they should submit receipts. Worsley is reported to have quipped, &quot;Does that include underwear?&quot; Later, he received psychiatric treatment and missed action. It is said upon emerging from retirement to play for the North Stars he was assured, as Minnesota was in the middle of the continent, the team travelled less than any other in the league.

===Soccer career===
Worsley was an excellent soccer player, beginning his career as a junior with Westmount. In 1948 he was a member of the Montreal youth all-star team. As a promising young player, he soon attracted attention; the following year he moved up to McMasterville in the Montreal League. There he was selected to play in a trial game from which the Montreal all-stars were chosen to play the touring English club Fulham FC on 29th May 1951 (the game was drawn 2-2).

In the summer of 1952, while a member of the Saskatoon Quakers, he played centre forward for the Saskatoon All-stars against the touring Tottenham Hotspur football club from England. In 1953, he joined Montréal Hakoah FC and helped his new club to the Canadian final, but they lost the three-game series to the Westminster Royals. In 1954, he played with Montreal Vickers. His father was also an outstanding soccer player and won a Canadian championship medal with Montreal Grand Trunk in 1919.

===Injuries===
Worsley suffered many injuries during his career. While with Vancouver of the WHL, he sustained a back injury that nearly ended his career when Gus Kyle hit him from behind. He also suffered a knee problem in the 1956 playoffs that required surgery; a severed tendon in 1960; a blistering shot from Bobby Hull that hit him in the forehead in 1961; a pulled hamstring that same year; another pulled hamstring in 1963–64; knee surgery in 1966; a sprained knee, then a concussion from a hard-boiled egg thrown by a New York fan; a broken finger in the 1969 playoffs; a pulled hamstring in 1972–73 that forced his temporary retirement. The blast to the forehead from Bobby Hull knocked him unconscious and sent him to Montreal&#x27;s Royal Victoria Hospital. Upon awakening, asked how he was feeling, Gump replied: &quot;Good thing the puck hit me flat!&quot;

==Retirement and death==
At the time of his retirement, Worsley had played more games than any goalie except Terry Sawchuk and Glenn Hall. He retired with a record of 335 wins, 352 losses and 150 ties, 43 shutouts, and a goals-against average of 2.91.

Worsley suffered a heart attack on January 22, 2007, and died at Hôpital Honoré-Mercier in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec on January 26, 2007. He was survived by his wife, Doreen Chapman and his children Lorne, Dean, Drew, and Lianne.

==Legacy==
Two Canadian indie rock bands recorded tributes to Worsley — Huevos Rancheros released &quot;Gump Worsley&#x27;s Lament&quot; and The Weakerthans released &quot;Elegy for Gump Worsley&quot;. Canadian band Sons of Freedom named their second album &quot;Gump&quot; after Worsley. In the TV series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; a property management company is named &quot;Gump and Worsley.&quot;

<text>Jeremie Miller (born ) is an American software developer and entrepreneur best known for his role in the development of Jabber and the release of codice_1, an early implementation of an XMPP server, in 1999. His work contributed to the standardization of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) by the Internet Engineering Task Force in 2004, and variations of XMPP have since been implemented on WhatsApp, Kik Messenger, and Zoom.

In 2007, Miller became the technical lead for Wikia Search, an open-source search engine initiative. He later co-founded Singly, Inc. in 2010, which introduced Telehash and Locker. The company was later acquired by Appcelerator in 2013. Currently, Miller sits on the board of directors for Bluesky Social, a social media platform.

==Biography==

Miller is from Cascade, Iowa, and lives in Denver, Colorado.

Miller began developing software on his farm in Iowa. He attended Iowa State University where he studied computer and electrical design. He broke off his studies early in 1995 to join an Internet startup company.

He began working on Jabber in 1998, and later released codice_1, the first implementation of an XMPP server, on January 4, 1999. He also wrote one of the first XML parsers in JavaScript. The release of codice_3 in May 2000, including protocols for real-time XML streaming by Jeremie Miller and the open-source community, were the basis for XMPP when it was standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force in RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 during October 2004. Variations of XMPP based on Miller&#x27;s work have since been adopted by WhatsApp, Kik Messenger, and Zoom (software).

In May 2007, he was hired at Wikia to be technical lead for a project to create an open search engine called Wikia Search.
Miller co-founded a company called Singly in 2010, which announced the Locker Project in 2011 and TeleHash projects.

Singly was acquired by Appcelerator in August 2013 on undisclosed terms.

<text>GameSpy Arcade was a shareware multiplayer game server browsing utility. GameSpy Arcade allowed players to view and connect to available multiplayer games, and chat with other users of the service. It was initially released by GameSpy Industries, on November 13, 2000, to replace the aging GameSpy3D and Mplayer.com program. Version 2.0.5 was the latest offering of the software, boasting additional features such as increased speed and advanced server sorting abilities.

==History==
Discussing GameSpy Arcade&#x27;s history, Ian Birnbaum of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; wrote, &quot;GameSpy began in 1996 as a fan-hosted server for the original &quot;Quake&quot;. By the early 2000s, GameSpy was &quot;the&quot; online multiplayer platform, adding dozens of games every year.&quot; The service closed in May 2014.

==Features==
GameSpy Arcade included various other features which enhance its overall functionality:
*Ability for users to have their own profiles.
*Scanning a user&#x27;s hard disk for Arcade compatible games.
*A basic web browser.
*Voice Chat
*Buddy Instant Messaging
*Game Staging rooms
*Dedicated Server browsing
*User Rooms

==Subscription==
GameSpy Arcade was free. However the software maintained shareware status as there were three different subscription levels. These levels provided benefits, each according to their price.

=== Basic users ===

&quot;Basic users&quot; could be created for free at the GameSpy website. They were able to display and connect to games, as well as chat to users inside the game lobby. Advertisements were shown inside the program for these users.

=== GameSpy Arcade ===

&quot;GameSpy Arcade&quot;, the first pay subscription service ($4.95/Month, $24.95/Year), provided extended functionality such as no advertisements and in-game voice chat, as well as priority service for technicians to assist in solving problems with the software.

=== Founders Club ===

&quot;Founders Club&quot;, the second pay subscription service ($9.95/Month, $79.95/Year), was the highest possible level of membership to GameSpy arcade. This subscription had benefits which applied across the entire GameSpy network, including FilePlanet access, and ‘Insider’ newsletters. This was the most expensive of the subscriptions on offer. There were some issues with the &quot;Founders Club&quot; subscription that caused this subscription to show up as a normal subscription on GameSpy Arcade.

==Games==
GameSpy Arcade allowed users to play games online such as , Battlefield 2, Half-Life: Counter-Strike, Unreal Tournament, Star Wars: Battlefront II, Quake III Arena, Rogue Spear, as well as various other first-person shooters and strategy games. Additionally, there were parlor games, but these were removed due to security flaws found in the actual parlor games. Some of the parlor games that existed were Y.A.R.N (story making) Reversi, Checkers, Chess, and Backgammon.

<doc id="1228480" wikidata="Q1266423" url="?curid=1228480" title="Pancreaticoduodenectomy">
<text>A pancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a major surgical operation most often performed to remove cancerous tumours from the head of the pancreas. It is also used for the treatment of pancreatic or duodenal trauma, or chronic pancreatitis. Due to the shared blood supply of organs in the proximal gastrointestinal system, surgical removal of the head of the pancreas also necessitates removal of the duodenum, proximal jejunum, gallbladder, and, occasionally, part of the stomach.

== Anatomy involved in the procedure ==

The most common technique of a pancreaticoduodenectomy consists of the removal of the distal segment (antrum) of the stomach, the first and second portions of the duodenum, the head of the , the common bile duct, and the gallbladder. Lymph nodes in the area are often removed during the operation as well (lymphadenectomy). However, not all lymph nodes are removed in the most common type of pancreaticoduodenectomy because studies showed that patients did not benefit from the more extensive surgery.

At the very beginning of the procedure, after the surgeons have gained access to the abdomen, the surfaces of the peritoneum and the liver are inspected for disease that has metastasized. This is an important first step as the presence of active metastatic disease is a contraindication to performing the operation.

The vascular supply of the pancreas is from the celiac artery via the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and the superior mesenteric artery from the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery. There are additional smaller branches given off by the right gastric artery which is also derived from the celiac artery. The reason for the removal of the duodenum along with the head of the pancreas is that they share the same arterial blood supply (the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery). These arteries run through the head of the pancreas so that both organs must be removed if the single blood supply is severed. If only the head of the pancreas were removed it would compromise blood flow to the duodenum, resulting in tissue necrosis.

While the blood supply to the liver is left intact, the common bile duct is removed. This means that while the liver remains with a good blood supply the surgeon must make a new connection to drain bile produced in the liver. This is done at the end of the surgery. The surgeon will make a new attachment between the pancreatic duct and the jejunum or stomach. During the surgery, a cholecystectomy is performed to remove the gallbladder. This portion is not done en bloc, as the gallbladder is removed separately.

Relevant nearby anatomy not removed during the procedure include the major vascular structures in the area: the portal vein, the superior mesenteric vein, and the superior mesenteric artery, the inferior vena cava. These structures are important to consider in this operation especially if done for resection of a tumor located in the head of the pancreas.

== Medical indications ==
Pancreaticoduodenectomy is most often performed as a curative treatment for periampullary cancer, which includes cancer of the bile duct, duodenum, ampulla or head of the pancreas. The shared blood supply of the pancreas, duodenum and common bile duct necessitates en bloc resection of these multiple structures. Other indications for pancreaticoduodenectomy include chronic pancreatitis, benign tumors of the pancreas, cancer metastatic to the pancreas, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

=== Pancreatic cancer ===
Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the only potentially curative intervention for malignant tumors of the pancreas. However, the majority of patients with pancreatic cancer present with metastatic or locally advanced un-resectable disease; thus only 15–20% of patients are candidates for the Whipple procedure. Surgery may follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which aims to shrink the tumor and increase the likelihood of complete resection. Post-operative death and complications associated with pancreaticoduodenectomy have become less common, with rates of post-operative mortality falling from 30 to 10% in the 1980s to less than 5% in the 2000s.

=== Ampullary cancer ===
Ampullary cancer arises from the lining of the ampulla of Vater.

=== Duodenal cancer ===
Duodenal cancer arises from the lining of the duodenal mucosa. Majority of duodenal cancers originate in the second part of the duodenum, where ampulla is located.

=== Cholangiocarcinoma ===
Cholangiocarcinoma, or cancer of the bile duct, is an indication for the Whipple procedure when the cancer is present in the distal biliary system, usually the common bile duct that drains into the duodenum. Depending on the location and extension of the cholangiocarcinoma, curative surgical resection may require hepatectomy, or removal of part of the liver, with or without pancreaticoduodenectomy.

=== Chronic pancreatitis ===
Treatment of chronic pancreatitis typically includes pain control and management of exocrine insufficiency. Intractable abdominal pain is the main surgical indication for surgical management of chronic pancreatitis. Removal of the head of the pancreas can relieve pancreatic duct obstruction associated with chronic pancreatitis.

=== Trauma ===
Damage to the pancreas and duodenum from blunt abdominal trauma is uncommon. In rare cases when this pattern of trauma has been reported, it has been caused by a lap seat belt in motor vehicle accidents. Pancreaticoduodenectomy has been performed when abdominal trauma has resulted in bleeding around the pancreas and duodenum, damage to the common bile duct, pancreatic leakage, or transection of the duodenum. Due to the rarity of this procedure in the treatment of trauma, there is not robust evidence regarding post-operative outcomes.

== Contraindications ==
In order to be considered for surgical removal, the tumor cannot encase more than 50% of any of the following vessels: the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, or inferior vena cava. In cases where less than 50% of the vessel is involved, vascular surgeons remove the involved portion of the vessel, and repair the residual artery or vein. Tumors are still borderline resectable even if they involve the superior mesenteric or portal veins, gastroduodenal artery, superior mesenteric vein or colon.

Metastatic disease is another contraindication to surgery. It most often occurs in the peritoneum, in the liver, and in the omentum. In order to determine if there are metastases, surgeons will inspect the abdomen at the beginning of the procedure after gaining access. Alternatively, they may perform a separate procedure called a diagnostic laparoscopy which involves insertion of a small camera through a small incision to look inside the abdomen. This may spare the patient the large abdominal incision that would occur if they were to undergo the initial part of a pancreaticoduodenectomy that was cancelled due to metastatic disease.

Further contraindications include encasement of major vessels (such as celiac artery, inferior vena cava, or superior mesenteric artery) as mentioned above.

== Surgical considerations ==

=== Pylorus-sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy ===
Clinical trials have failed to demonstrate significant survival benefits of total pancreatectomy, mostly because patients who submit to this operation tend to develop a particularly severe form of diabetes mellitus called brittle diabetes. Sometimes the pancreaticojejunostomy may not hold properly after the completion of the operation and infection may spread inside the patient. This may lead to another operation shortly thereafter in which the remainder of the pancreas (and sometimes the spleen) is removed to prevent further spread of infection and possible morbidity. In recent years the pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (also known as Traverso–Longmire procedure/PPPD) has been gaining popularity, especially among European surgeons. The main advantage of this technique is that the pylorus, and thus normal gastric emptying, should in theory be preserved. There is conflicting data as to whether pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy is associated with increased likelihood of gastric emptying. In practice, it shows similar long-term survival as a Whipple&#x27;s (pancreaticoduodenectomy + hemigastrectomy), but patients benefit from improved recovery of weight after a PPPD, so this should be performed when the tumour does not involve the stomach and the lymph nodes along the gastric curvatures are not enlarged.

Compared to the standard Whipple procedure, the pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy technique is associated with shorter operation time and less intraoperative blood loss, requiring less blood transfusion. Post-operative complications, hospital mortality and survival do not differ between the two methods.

=== Morbidity and mortality ===
Pancreaticoduodenectomy is considered, by any standard, to be a major surgical procedure.

Many studies have shown that hospitals where a given operation is performed more frequently have better overall results (especially in the case of more complex procedures, such as pancreaticoduodenectomy). A frequently cited study published in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; found operative mortality rates to be four times higher (16.3 v. 3.8%) at low-volume (averaging less than one pancreaticoduodenectomy per year) hospitals than at high-volume (16 or more per year) hospitals. Even at high-volume hospitals, morbidity has been found to vary by a factor of almost four depending on the number of times the surgeon has previously performed the procedure.
de Wilde et al. have reported statistically significant mortality reductions concurrent with centralization of the procedure in the Netherlands. 
One study reported actual risk to be 2.4 times greater than the risk reported in the medical literature, with additional variation by type of institution.

=== Postoperative complications ===
Three of the most common post-operative complications are delayed gastric emptying, bile leak, and pancreatic leak. Delayed gastric emptying, normally defined as an inability to tolerate a regular diet by the end of the first post-op week and the requirement for nasogastric tube placement, occurs in approximately 17% of operations. During the surgery, a new biliary connection (normally a choledochal-jejunal anastamosis connecting the common bile duct and jejunum) is made. This new connection may leak in 1–2% of operations. As this complication is fairly common, it is normal in this procedure for the surgeon to leave a drain in place at the end. This allows for detection of a bile leak via elevated bilirubin in the fluid drained. Pancreatic leak or pancreatic fistula, defined as fluid drained after postoperative day 3 that has an amylase content greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal, occurs in 5–10% of operations, although changes in the definition of fistula may now include a much larger proportion of patients (upwards of 40%).

== Recovery after surgery ==
Immediately after surgery, patients are monitored for return of bowel function and appropriate closed-suction drainage of the abdomen.

=== Return of bowel function ===
Ileus, which refers to functional obstruction or aperistalsis of the intestine, is a physiologic response to abdominal surgery, including the Whipple procedure. While post-operative ileus is typically self-limited, prolonged post-operative ileus occurs when patients develop nausea, abdominal distention, pain or intolerance of food by mouth. Various measures are taken in the immediate post-operative period to minimize prolonged post-operative ileus. A nasogastric tube is typically maintained to suction, to drain gastric and intestinal contents. Ambulation is encouraged to stimulate return of bowel function. Use of opioid medications, which interfere with intestinal motility, is limited.

== History ==
The first attempted pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in 1898 by Alessandro Codivilla, though it was unsuccessful. The first successful operation was performed by Walther Kausch in 1909. Kausch described the first periampullary cancer resection in 1912.

Pancreaticoduodenectomy is often called &quot;Whipple&#x27;s procedure&quot; or the &quot;Whipple procedure&quot; after the American surgeon Allen Whipple, who devised an improved version of the surgery in 1935 while at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. The operation as performed initially by Whipple was in two stages. Of the first three patients Whipple operated on, one died during the operation, and none survived beyond 28 months. Though its therapeutic effects were discovered in 1929, Vitamin K was not commercially available until 1940. With its introduction, a one-stage pancreaticoduodenectomy was now a viable and more appealing option. With this pharmacologic breakthrough, Whipple was able to attempt and successfully perform a one-stage pancreaticoduodenectomy in 1940. He outlined the new procedure in his seminal paper &quot;Observations on Radical Surgery for Lesions of the Pancreas&quot; in June 1946.

Though initially attempted as early as 1937 by Alexander Brunschwig, the first successful pylorus-sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in 1976 by William Traverso and Longmire.

==Nomenclature==
Fingerhut et al. argue that while the terms &quot;pancreatoduodenectomy&quot; and &quot;pancreaticoduodenectomy&quot; are often used interchangeably in the medical literature, scrutinizing their etymology yields different definitions for the two terms. As a result, the authors prefer &quot;pancreatoduodenectomy&quot; over &quot;pancreaticoduodenectomy&quot; for the name of this procedure, as strictly speaking &quot;pancreaticoduodenectomy&quot; should refer to the resection of the duodenum and pancreatic duct rather than the pancreas itself.

<text>[[Flanders|Flemish]] [[political party|political parties]] operate in the whole Flemish Community, which covers the unilingual Flemish Region and the bilingual Brussels-Capital Region. In the latter, they compete with French-speaking parties that all also operate in Wallonia. There are very few parties that operate on a national level in Belgium. Flanders generally tends to vote for right-wing, conservative parties, whereas in French-speaking Belgium the socialist party is usually the most successful one.

Flanders has a diverse multi-party system of politics. Many parties are active, and often none succeeds in obtaining more than one third of the votes, let alone a majority. Therefore, parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.

Most current Flemish parties grew from the main political parties that for long dominated Belgian politics: the Catholic Party (Church-oriented and conservative), the Liberal Party (anti-clerical and progressive) and the Socialist Party. These three groups still dominate Flemish politics, but they have evolved substantially in character. In the 21st century however, conservative nationalist parties such as Vlaams Blok/Belang and especially the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) which became the largest party in 2010, were successful and broke the domination of the traditional catholic, liberal and socialist parties.

== Catholics/Christian Democrats ==

The Christian-democratic party has its origins in the 19th century. in that period, it mainly competed with the liberals. They for long took turns in leading Belgian government. By the end of the 19th century, the then emerging socialist party rapidly took an important place in Belgian politics. This continued in the first half of the 20th century. In the 1930s, the Christian-democrats started feeling competition from Flemish nationalists.

After World War II, the Catholic (now Christian Democratic) Party severed its formal ties with the Church. It became a mass party of the center, somewhat like a big tent political party in the United States.

In 1978, the Christian Democratic Party, responding to linguistic tensions in the country, divided into two independent parties: the &quot;Parti Social Chrétien&quot; (PSC) in French-speaking Belgium and the &quot;Christelijke Volkspartij&quot; (CVP) in Flanders. The two parties pursue the same basic policies but maintain separate organizations. The CVP was the larger of the two, getting more than twice as many votes as the PSC.

Following the 1999 federal elections, the CVP and PSC were ousted from office, bringing an end to a 40-year term on the government benches. In 2001, the CVP changed its name to CD&amp;V (&quot;Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams&quot;). They won again during the 2007 federal elections, cooperating with the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA). Later on, CD&amp;V and N-VA split and CD&amp;V reached a record low during the 2010 federal elections whereas N-VA became the biggest party.

==Socialists/Social Democrats==

The modern Socialist party have lost its original Marxist ideology. They are now social-democratic parties similar to those also affiliated to the pan-European Party of European Socialists. The Socialists have been part of many postwar governments and have produced some of the country&#x27;s most distinguished statesmen. As with the Belgian Christian Democrats, the Belgian Socialist Party also split along linguistic lines in 1978.

In the 1980s, the Flemish Socialists focused heavily on international issues, and on security in Europe in particular, where they frequently opposed U.S. policies. However, first with Willy Claes, then Frank Vandenbroucke and with Erik Derycke as Foreign Minister, the party made a significant shift to the center adopting less controversial stances on foreign policy issues.

In 2001, the Flemish Socialist Party (&quot;Socialistische Partij&quot;, SP) changed its name to Socialist Party Different (&quot;Socialistische Partij anders&quot;) and was most commonly known by the acronym SP.a. Until on 21 March 2021 when the current name Forward (Vooruit) was adopted.

==Liberals==

The Flemish Liberals and Democrats (&quot;Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten&quot;, VLD) who opened up their ranks to Volksunie defectors during the 1990s, was successful during that period and formed governments with Guy Verhofstadt as Prime Minister. They lost again in 2007 and decreased further in the 2010 election.

The Liberals chiefly appeal to business-people, property owners, shopkeepers, and the self-employed, in general. In American terms the Liberals&#x27; economic positions would be considered to reflect a moderate conservative ideology.

Over the last decade, a number of parties originated, as break away parties from the VLD. These were &quot;Liberaal Appèl&quot;, founded by Ward Beysen, VLOTT, founded by Hugo Coveliers and &quot;Lijst Dedecker&quot;, founded by Jean-Marie Dedecker. These parties advocated classical liberal economics and a more rightwing approach to society, and accused the VLD of shifting fundamentally to the left.

==Nationalists/Conservatives/Linguistic parties==
The foremost nationalist party in Flanders is the Vlaams Belang (&quot;Flemish Interest&quot;), which was founded in 2004, after its predecessor Vlaams Blok (&quot;Flemish Block&quot;) was condemned by a High Court for &quot;permanent incitation to discrimination and racism.&quot; The Vlaams Belang is most strident in pursuing a nationalist agenda (Flemish independence).

The most militant Flemish regional party in Parliament in the 1950s and 1960s, the Volksunie (VU), once drew nearly one-quarter of Belgium&#x27;s Dutch-speaking electorate away from the traditional parties. The Volksunie was in the forefront of a successful campaign by the country&#x27;s Flemish population for cultural and political parity with the nation&#x27;s long dominant French-speaking population. However, later on the party suffered severe setbacks and in October 2001 the party disintegrated. The social-liberal wing founded Spirit, later called the Social Liberal Party, while the more traditional Flemish nationalist wing continued under the banner &quot;New Flemish Alliance&quot; (N-VA). After a disappointing result in the regional elections of 2009, the Social Liberal Party decided to fuse with the Flemish ecologists of &quot;Groen&quot;.

In the 2010 federal elections, the New Flemish Alliance became the biggest party and broke the domination of the traditional parties.
==Ecologists/Greens==

The Flemish ecologists (Groen, previously called Agalev and Groen!) made their parliamentary breakthrough in 1981. They focus heavily on environmental issues and investing in public transport to solve mobility issues.

Their results generally remain stable, the greens were especially successful in the 1999 federal elections, after which they joined a federal coalition cabinet for the first time in their history, but were ousted after the next elections. They similarly joined Flemish governments in the 1999-2004 period.
==French-speaking minority==
The &quot;Union des Francophones&quot; (UF) is a Belgian electoral list which participates in regional, provincial and municipal elections in the Brussels Periphery, which is the part of the province of Flemish Brabant surrounding the bilingual Brussels Region. As the name suggests, its primary target are the French-speaking inhabitants of Flemish Brabant and particularly those who live in Halle-Vilvoorde and the predominantly French-speaking municipalities with linguistic facilities near the Brussels-Capital Region. The UF is a cooperation between the three most important French-speaking parties in Belgium: the Mouvement Réformateur, the Centre Démocrate Humaniste and the Parti Socialiste. The coalition wants an enlargement of the bilingual Brussels-Capital Region through the merger of various municipalities with linguistic facilities with a large percentage of French-speakers, like Sint-Genesius-Rode, and opposed the splitting of the bilingual Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde electoral and judicial constituency.

The party has one representative in the Flemish Parliament, five to six in the Flemish Brabant provincial council and several municipal councillors in the concerning towns.

==Communists==

The &quot;Kommunistische Partij&quot; (KP) is the successor in Flanders of the &quot;Kommunistische Partij van België&quot; (KPB), the first communist party in Belgium. This party was founded in 1921, but disappeared out of the Belgian Parliament after the elections of 1985.

The most successful Maoist movement to emerge in Flanders was &quot;Alle Macht Aan De Arbeiders&quot; (AMADA - All Power To The Workers) at the end of the 1960s during a time of students protests at the University of Leuven. In 1979 this movement evolved into the &quot;Partij van de Arbeid van België&quot; (PVDA), which is at the moment the biggest communist party in Flanders and is represented in some municipal councils in Flanders, and in the Flemish Parliament.

Other minor communist parties are the Trotskyist &quot;Socialistische Arbeiderspartij&quot; (SAP) and the &quot;Linkse Socialistische Partij&quot; (LSP).

==Alliances==
After the installation of a 5% electoral threshold, with private funding close to forbidden and public funding only for parties with at least one representative in parliament, some of the smaller parties have made alliances with a larger, more traditional party. Parties in any alliance remain independent, but they would field candidates on one combined list at elections. In general, the smaller party/parties would be assured of gaining seats, and the larger party would be assured of obtaining a larger overall share of the vote. This was especially true for the CD&amp;V / N-VA alliance, whereby CD&amp;V became the largest party by votes in the Flemish regional elections, so therefore it could initiate coalition talks and the party could appoint the leader of the Flemish regional government. The VLD / Vivant alliance did not perform well in the polls. The proposed SP.a / Spirit / Groen! alliance did not succeed, instead the SP.a / Spirit alliance went to the polls.

== Electoral results and membership ==

CD&amp;V had the highest number of members (followed by the other two traditional parties) from its founding until the 2010s, when its membership decreased rapidly and sunk below Open Vld.

<text>Phosphatidylinositol or inositol phospholipid is a biomolecule. It was initially called &quot;inosite&quot; when it was discovered by Léon Maquenne and Johann Joseph von Scherer in the late 19th century. It was discovered in bacteria but later also found in eukaryotes, and was found to be a signaling molecule.

The biomolecule can exist in 9 different isomers. It is a lipid which contains a phosphate group, two fatty acid chains, and one inositol sugar molecule. Typically, the phosphate group has a negative charge (at physiological pH values). As a result, the molecule is amphiphilic.

The production of the molecule is limited to the endoplasmic reticulum.

==History of phospatidylinositol==

Phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its derivatives have a rich history dating back to their discovery by Johann Joseph von Scherer and Léon Maquenne in the late 19th century. Initially known as &quot;inosite&quot; based on its sweet taste, the isolation and characterization of inositol laid the groundwork for understanding its cyclohexanol structure. Théodore Posternak&#x27;s work further elucidated the configuration of myo-inositol, the principal form found in eukaryotic tissues. The study of inositol isomers and their physiological functions has revealed a complex interplay in various organisms.

The esterified presence of inositol in lipids, particularly PI, was first observed in bacteria and later confirmed in eukaryotic organisms by researchers like Clinton Ballou and Dan Brown. Their pioneering work established the structure of PI and its phosphorylated forms, shedding light on their roles as signaling molecules. Despite the complexity of inositol nomenclature and isomerism, modern research has greatly advanced the understanding of their diverse functions in cellular physiology and signaling pathways.

The discovery of PI and its derivatives, along with their intricate roles in cellular signaling, marks a significant chapter in the field of biochemistry. From early investigations into inositol&#x27;s structure to the identification of its various isomers and their physiological functions, the study of inositol compounds continues to uncover new insights into cellular processes. 

==Structure and chemistry==

Phosphatidylinositol (PI), also known as inositol phospholipid, is a lipid composed of a phosphate group, two fatty acid chains, and one inositol molecule. It belongs to the class of phosphatidylglycerides and is typically found as a minor component on the cytosolic side of eukaryotic cell membranes. The phosphate group imparts a negative charge to the molecules at physiological pH.

PI can exist in nine different forms, myo-, scyllo-, muco-, epi-, neo-, allo-, D-chiro-, L-chiro-, and cis-inositol. These isomers are common in biology and have many functions, for example taste sensory, regulating phosphate levels, metabolic flux, transcription, mRNA export and translation, insulin signaling, embryonic development and stress response. Cis-inositol is the only isomer not found naturally in nature.

PI exhibits an amphiphilic nature, with both polar and non-polar regions, due to its glycerophospholipid structure containing a glycerol backbone, two non-polar fatty acid tails, and a phosphate group substituted with an inositol polar head group.

==Phosphoinositides==
Phosphorylated forms of phosphatidylinositol (PI) are called phosphoinositides and play important roles in lipid signaling, cell signaling and membrane trafficking. The inositol ring can be phosphorylated by a variety of kinases on the three, four and five hydroxyl groups in seven different combinations. However, the two and six hydroxyl groups are typically not phosphorylated due to steric hindrance.

All seven variations of the following phosphoinositides have been found in animals:

Phosphatidylinositol monophosphates:
* Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, also known as PtdIns3&quot;P&quot; or PI(3)P
* Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, also known as PtdIns4&quot;P&quot; or PI(4)P
* Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate, also known as PtdIns5&quot;P&quot; or PI(5)P

Phosphatidylinositol bisphosphates:
* Phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, also known as PtdIns(3,4)&quot;P&quot;2 or PI(3,4)P2
* Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, also known as PtdIns(3,5)&quot;P&quot;2 or PI(3,5)P2
* Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, also known as PtdIns(4,5)&quot;P&quot;2, PI(4,5)P2 or often simply referred to as PIP2

Phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate:
* Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, also known as PtdIns(3,4,5)&quot;P&quot;3 or PI(3,4,5)P3

These phosphoinositides are also found in plant cells, with the exception of PIP3.

== Hydrolysis ==
The significance of phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolism lies in its role as a potential transducing mechanism, evident from studies showing hormone and neurotransmitter-induced hydrolysis of PI. The hydrolysis starts with the enzyme PI 4-kinase alpha (PI4Kα) converting PI into PI 4-phosphate (PI4P), which is then converted into PI (4,5) biphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) by the enzyme PI 4-phosphate-5-kinase (PI4P5K). PI(4,5)P2 is then hydrolysed by phospholipase C (PLC) and forms the second messengers, inositol (1,4,5) triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DG). DG is then phosphorylated to phosphatidic acid (PA) by DG kinase (DGK). PA is also directly produced from phosphatidylcholine (PC) by phospholipase D (PLD). Lipid transfer proteins facilitate the exchange of PI and PA between membranes, ensuring its availability for receptor mechanisms on the plasma membrane, even in organelles like mitochondria incapable of PI synthesis.
==Biosynthesis==
The synthesis of Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is limited to the Endoplasmatic Reticulum (ER), which is the largest membrane component of the cell. This site also contributes the synthesis to the majority of phospholipids, namely phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS) and triacylglycerol (TG). The synthesis involves a series of enzymatic reactions.

The biosynthesis and phosphorylation of PI is mainly confined to the cytosolic facing surface of organelles by already residential kinases, but not at the ER specifically. &quot;De novo&quot; PI synthesis of PI starts with an acylated process of Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G-3-P) by GPAT enzymes at the &quot;sn-1&quot; acyl chain position. The process is then followed by a second acylation with LPAAT1, LPAAT2 and LPAAT3, LPAAT enzymes, at the &quot;sn-2&quot; acyl chain position. This double step process acylates G-3-P to phosphatidic acid (PA). 

PA is converted into the intermediate CDP- diacylglycerol (CDP-DG) by a process called CDP-diaglycerol synthase. This synthesis is catalyzed by the use of CDS1 and CDS2, CDS- enzymes. In the final enzymatic process, CDP-DG and inositol are catalyzed by the enzyme PI synthase (PIS) and synthesised into PI.

<text>Glenfield () is a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand, located on the North Shore. Established as a rural community in the 1850s, the area developed as a suburban part of Auckland after the completion of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in 1959.

==Etymology==
The name Mayfield was first associated with the area in the late 19th century. Before this, settlers considered the area rural sections of Takapuna, Birkenhead or Northcote. The name was first used in an advertisement by R. Arthur, a landowner who subdivided 250 acres of land in 1883. The name was adopted by residents for the school and area in 1890, referring to the blossoming white mānuka bushes that residents felt were reminiscent of springtime (i.e. May) in England. In 1912, local residents petitioned the post office to change the name of the area to Glenfield. Until this point, the post office used the name Freemans, referring to John Freeman, the homeowner who operated the post office from his home from 1888. The post office had refused to use the name Mayfield, due to potential confusion with Mayfield in the Canterbury Region.

The first name on early colonial maps associated with the area is , which refers to puawānanga, a native species of clematis. The name was used to refer to an inland bush area of the North Shore where puawānanga grew, which early European settlers called Quick&#x27;s Bush. In 2013, Glenfield College adopted the name Te Puawānanga for the school&#x27;s whare wānanga.

==Geography==

Glenfield is a suburb of the North Shore of New Zealand. It is located between the Kaipātiki Creek, a tributary of Oruamo or Hellyers Creek, and the Wairau Valley. The highest point in the suburb is a hill between Colin Wild Place and Chivalry Road, which reaches a height of above sea level.

The area is primarily formed from Early Miocene Waitemata Group sandstone and mudstone. Prior to human settlement, the area was a kauri and mixed podocarp forest, which by the 19th century developed into a mānuka-dominated scrubland.

Areas within Glenfield include Marlborough, an area of south-eastern Glenfield that developed in the 1960s and early 1970s on the site of Alex Anderson&#x27;s former farm, and Glenfield North.

==History==
===Māori history===
Māori settlement of the Auckland Region began around the 13th or 14th centuries. The North Shore was settled by Tāmaki Māori, including people descended from the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory canoe and ancestors of figures such as Taikehu and Peretū. Many of the early Tāmaki Māori people of the North Shore identified as Ngā Oho,

The poor clay soils of the area were not suitable for Māori traditional gardening techniques, meaning Glenfield was not as densely settled as other areas of the North Shore, such as the Upper Waitematā Harbour eastern shores or the Devonport-Takapuna areas. The forests of the inland North Shore were a place where berries were harvested.

Archaeological middens have been found on the shores of the Kaipātiki Creek, and Manuka Road was originally an (traditional path) linking Oruamo or Hellyers Creek to the central North Shore.

The warrior Maki migrated from the Kāwhia Harbour to his ancestral home in the Auckland Region, likely sometime in the 17th century. Maki conquered and unified many the Tāmaki Māori tribes as Te Kawerau ā Maki, including those of the North Shore. After Maki&#x27;s death, his sons settled different areas of his lands, creating new hapū. His younger son Maraeariki settled the North Shore and Hibiscus Coast, who based himself at the head of the Ōrewa River. Maraeariki&#x27;s daughter Kahu succeeded him, and she is the namesake of the North Shore, (&quot;The Greater Lands of Kahu&quot;), Many of the iwi of the North Shore, including Ngāti Manuhiri, Ngāti Maraeariki, Ngāti Kahu, Ngāti Poataniwha, Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki and Ngāti Whātua, can trace their lineage to Kahu.

During the early 1820s, most Māori of the North Shore fled for the Waikato or Northland due to the threat of war parties during the Musket Wars. When Tāmaki Māori returned in greater numbers to the Auckland Region in the mid-1830s, Te Kawerau ā Maki focused settlement at Te Henga / Bethells Beach.

===Early European settlement===
One of the earliest land sales to European settlers in Auckland took place near Glenfield on 17 April 1837, when Ngāti Whātua rangatira Nanihi and Tuire sold Te Pukapuka, a block to American whaler William Webster, at the north-eastern headwaters of Oruamo or Hellyers Creek, near Bayview. Webster on-sold the land to Thomas Hellyer on 13 October 1840, who established the Retreat, a house which included a kauri sawpit, a hut, and a workshop. The Retreat became well known among sailors, who would stop at the Retreat for fresh water and beer from the Retreat&#x27;s brewhouse. On 22 December 1841, Hellyer&#x27;s body was discovered at the Retreat, and while an investigation took place, no person was convicted of his murder.

Glenfield was a part of the Mahurangi Block, which was purchased by the New Zealand Government in 1841. In the 1850s, the first European settlers in Glenfield developed orchards and dairy farms, including the Mackay and McFetridge families. The surrounding areas were worked by gum diggers, from 1859 up until the 1920s. Gum diggers would regularly set fire to the mānuka scrubland, in order to more easily locate kauri gum.

Windy Ridge was one of the first areas of inland Glenfield by European settlers, when Terence and Elizabeth Crook purchased north of Coronation Road, known as Gooches Corner. The section was later farmed by Minnie Gracie and her husband Arthur Moore Gracie.

===Rural community===
In the latter 19th and early 20th centuries, the main connection to the outside world were bush tracks. Fruit and farm produce would be carried along tracks and horse carriages to Northcote and Birkenhead, then on to Auckland markets by ferry.

Glenfield developed as a rural community centred on Mayfield Road in the 1880s, developing after major improvements were made to the road at Aranui Bluff / Cut Hill in 1885. By 1889, 24 cottages were built in the area surrounding Cut Hill, and a kauri gum store was established at the junction of Sunset and Glenfield roads in the 1890s. By this time, the name Mayfield had become associated with the area. Dairy farms located in rural Glenfield supplied milk to Auckland, and the farms north of Glenfield specialised in supplying cream.

In 1888, the first post office was established at Glenfield, named Freemans after John Freeman&#x27;s residence on the corner of Kaipatiki Road. In 1890, the New Zealand Hydropathic and Fruit Hospital was established at Glenfield, as a facility that treated conditions such as rheumatic gout, hysteria, dropsy, diabetes and constipation through treatments such as vegan diets and therapeutic baths.

In 1891, Mayfield School was opened, becoming a social centre for the growing area. Events such as card nights and concerts were held at the school in the 1900s, and residents complained of events where alcohol was consumed, which often left the school in a poor state, and was seen as causing rowdy behaviour and mayhem in the community. In 1912, the area was officially renamed Glenfield, due to issues the post office had with the name Mayfield being confused with Mayfield in the Canterbury Region.

On 4 September 1915, the local community constructed Mission Hall in a single day. The hall was a shared religious space used by local Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian communities. By the 1920s, the first store was established on Glenfield Road, as well as two brickworks, which closed in the 1930s. By the late 1920s motorcars were becoming more popular than horses for transportation in Glenfield.

In the 1920s, local resident James Mackay discovered the Captain Cook strawberry variety at his land at Cooks Beach. The variety was smaller and sweeter than previously popular varieties, and from 1929 Glenfield growers invested in this strawberry crop. The Captain Cook strawberry became the most popular strawberry variety in the Auckland Region for the next few decades.

The Glenfield War Memorial Hall, first called for in the 1900s as a substitute for the school hall, was finally built in 1934. The hall hosted major social events, including elaborate coronation balls.

===Suburbanisation===
The opening of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in 1959 led to rapid suburbanisation of Glenfield. After Glenfield was declared a county town in 1961, the population grew from 5,683 to 13,335 in 1966. Most of the suburb was developed in the 1960s, with the western areas of Glenfield developing into suburban housing later on.

With a rapidly increasingly population, the Waitemata County Council decided to establish a rubbish dump on reclaimed land in the Oruamo or Hellyers Creek foreshore in 1969. The plans were widely protested by residents, and were scarpered after the New Zealand Airforce, who insisted that no landfills could be located within one nautical mile of the RNZAF Base at Whenuapai or the RNZAF Station Hobsonville.

Glenfield was one of the most rapidly developing areas of New Zealand in the early 1970s. On 9 December 1971, in response to fears about commercial sprawl down the length of Glenfield Road, Glenfield Mall opened. It was the first shopping mall on the North Shore. The Glenfield Library was constructed in 1975.

In 2000, Glenfield Mall was redeveloped as a more modern shopping centre.

==Local government==

The North Shore Highway District was the first local government body in Glenfield. Commencing operation in 1868, the district administered projects including roads from Birkenhead north to the Ōkura River. From 1876, the area was administered by the Waitemata County, a large rural county north and west of the city of Auckland. In 1961, Glenfield became a county town within the Waitemata County, led by chairman Stan Compton until his death in 1965, and later by Arthur Gibbons.

On 1 August 1974, the Waitemata County was dissolved, and Glenfield was incorporated into Takapuna City. In 1989, Glenfield was merged into the North Shore City. North Shore City was amalgamated into Auckland Council in November 2010.

Within the Auckland Council, Glenfield is a part of the Kaipātiki local government area governed by the Kaipātiki Local Board. It is a part of the North Shore ward, which elects two councillors to the Auckland Council.

<doc id="1228500" wikidata="Q3922150" url="?curid=1228500" title="Priscilla Lopez">
<text>Priscilla Lopez is an American singer, dancer, and actress. She is perhaps best known for originating the role of Diana Morales in &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. She has had the distinction of appearing in two Broadway landmarks: one of its greatest hits, the highly acclaimed, long-running &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, and, as a teenager, in one of its biggest flops, the infamous musical version of &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, which closed before opening night.

==Early life==
Lopez was born in the Bronx, New York to Francisco Lopez, a hotel banquet foreman and Laura (née Candelaria), who had moved to New York from their native Puerto Rico.
==Career==

===Broadway===
Lopez graduated from Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Performing Arts, where she majored in drama; her experiences as a drama student are depicted in the musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. Had &quot;Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; survived, it would have marked her debut on Broadway, but the production was plagued with so many problems that its creative team deemed it impossible to fix. From there, she moved on to &quot;Henry, Sweet Henry&quot;, which lasted only two months at the end of 1967, when she was 19 years old. Her luck was no better the following year when &quot;Her First Roman&quot; lasted two weeks. 

&quot;A Chorus Line&quot; (1975) had Lopez portraying Diana Morales, a character patterned after herself. She introduced the hit song &quot;What I Did for Love&quot;, and sang &quot;Nothing&quot;, a song about a disastrously unsupportive drama class at the High School of Performing Arts.

In &quot;A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine&quot; (1980), Lopez stepped out of the ensemble and into the spotlight, displaying her comedic and vocal skills. The show had two acts, first a mini-musical about the early days of movie making, by Dick Vosburgh and Frank Lazarus with additional material by Jerry Herman, and second a send-up of the slapstick Marx Brothers movies, with Lopez playing Harpo. Both she and the show received rave reviews; it ran nearly a year-and-a-half, and she earned a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. In 1982, Tommy Tune, with whom she had worked in &quot;Hollywood/Ukraine&quot;, hired her as his assistant on &quot;Nine&quot;, the musical version of the Federico Fellini film &quot;8½&quot;. Midway through the run, she joined the cast taking over for Tony-winner Liliane Montevecchi in the role of Liliane La Fleur. Lopez also appeared on Broadway in the critically acclaimed play &quot;Anna in the Tropics&quot; in 2003. From 2008 to 2011, Lopez appeared as Camilla in the Broadway production of &quot;In the Heights&quot;. She took over the role of Berthe in the revival of &quot;Pippin&quot; from Annie Potts on July 22, 2014 through August 31 2014.

===Off-Broadway===
Her off-Broadway credits include &quot;Other People&#x27;s Money&quot;, &quot;Key Exchange&quot;, &quot;Extremities&quot;, &quot;The Oldest Profession&quot;, &quot;Beauty of the Father&quot; and &quot;Class Mother &#x27;68&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance. She was featured in the City Center Encores! production of &quot;Babes in Arms&quot;.

In 2021, Lopez was featured as Mabel in the internet musical &quot;Ratatouille: The Tiktok Musical&quot;, referencing both &quot;Nothing&quot; and &quot;What I Did For Love&quot; with alternated lyrics for the character and situation. Lopez starred in &quot;The Gardens of Anuncia&quot;, a musical by Michael John LaChiusa about the life of Graciela Daniele, portraying the older version of Daniele.

===Television===
Lopez starred as a liberal nun in an unsuccessful Norman Lear series &quot;In the Beginning&quot; with McLean Stevenson in 1978. She had a guest role on the ABC drama &quot;Family&quot;, starring Kristy McNichol and Sada Thompson; she played Buddy&#x27;s (McNichol) dance friend in the disco episodes. In 1983, she was the voice of Herself the Elf in the animated TV special &quot;The Magic of Herself the Elf&quot;. She had a key role in the short-lived 1986 medical drama &quot;Kay O&#x27;Brien&quot;. In 1993, Lopez starred in the television movie &quot;For the Love of My Child: The Anissa Ayala Story&quot;, in which she played a mother who, along with her husband, conceives a child to provide a suitable bone-marrow donor for their older daughter. Other television work includes &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Cosby&quot;, and &quot;B Positive&quot;. In 2021, she portrayed Abuela Sofia in the Disney Channel Original Movie, &quot;Christmas...Again?!&quot;.

===Film===
She had a brief role in &quot;Center Stage&quot;, and she appeared in &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot; playing the mother of Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s character, and had a role in the film version of the long-running off-Broadway hit &quot;Tony n&#x27; Tina&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. She appeared in the film &quot;Musical Chairs&quot; as the disapproving mother of E.J. Bonilla&#x27;s character.

<text>Exton is a small village and civil parish in the City of Winchester district of Hampshire, England. The village lies in the South Downs National Park, on the west bank of the River Meon, immediately to the north of Corhampton. It is located two miles north of Droxford and five miles north-east of Bishop&#x27;s Waltham. Its name first appears in 940 as &quot;East Seaxnatune&quot;, meaning &quot;farmstead of the East Saxons&quot;.

The parish straddles the Meon Valley, including higher ground of the South Downs to either side, with Old Winchester Hill to the east and the southern part of Beacon Hill (shared with Warnford parish) to the west. It is crossed from east to west by the South Downs Way long-distance footpath. The A32 and the Meon Valley Railway footpath cross from north to south.

The parish contains numerous archaeological sites including a Mesolithic flint working site, Bronze Age bowl barrows and the Iron Age fort at Old Winchester Hill. There are also Roman and Dark Age sites and the site of the mediaeval village of Lomer. The 13th-century church of St Peter and St Paul was heavily restored in the 19th century. The 1892 restoration (the second of the 19th century) added stained glass windows by Charles Spooner in the style of the Arts and Crafts movement. 

Exton has remained a small community for more than two centuries. In 1801 Exton&#x27;s total population was 224, by 1901 it had grown slightly to 299 yet by 2001 the population had shrunk to 230 and again to 203 at the 2011 Census. Photographs from the 1950s show a village shop and post office in Exton but this closed in the 1960s. The only community buildings in the village are the church and the Shoe Inn public house.

In 1870–72, John Goring&#x27;s &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&quot; described Exton like this:
:&quot;EXTON, a village and a parish in Droxford district, Hants. The village stands 2 miles N by E of Droxford, and 5 NE of Bishops-Waltham r. station; and has a post office under Southampton. The parish comprises 2,464 acres (10 km²). Real property, £2,640. Pop., 257. Houses, 41. Exton Lodge is a principal residence. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Winchester. Value, 331.* Patron, the Bishop of Winchester. The church was rebuilt in 1847, and is in the early English style. &quot;

<doc id="1228509" wikidata="Q12060802" url="?curid=1228509" title="Islands in the River Thames">
<text>This article lists the islands in the [[River Thames]], or at the mouth of a tributary (marked †), in England. It excludes human-made islands built as part of the building of forty-five two-gate locks which each accompany a weir, and islets subordinate to and forming part of the overall shape of another. The suffix &quot;-ey&quot; (pronounced today ) is common across England and Scotland and cognate with ait and meaning island, a term – as ait or eyot – unusually well-preserved on the Thames. A small minority of list entries are referred to as Island, Ait or Eyot and are vestiges, separated by a depression in the land or high-water-level gully.

Most are natural; others were created by excavation of an additional or replacement navigation channel, such as to provide a shorter route, a cut. Many result from accumulation of gravel, silt, wildfowl dung and plant decay and root strengthening, particularly from willows and other large trees. Unlike other large rivers, all today are considered fixed. All in the reaches below Lechlade have been protected against erosion by various combinations of canalisation of the river, building up with dredged material from the river bed, water reeds, concrete, cement, wood or sheet piling.

==List of former islands==
* Frog Island†, Rainham
* Isle of Dogs, Poplar, London

* Isle of Grain, Kent
* Thorney (or Thorney Island)† covered a broad area surrounding Westminster Abbey
* Bermondsey†, land and grounds of Bermondsey Abbey, formed by an anabranch (corollary channel) naturally dredged by the mouth of the Neckinger; a vestige of the channel is St Saviour&#x27;s Dock.
* Battersea Formerly bounded by the Heath Brook,Falcon Brook and Thames.
;Beyond the alluvium/silts of the estuary, by the English Channel and North Sea
*Isle of Thanet†, Kent

== List of islands ==




The islands are listed in order upstream from the sea.

==Oxford floodplain==
In the Oxford area the river splits into several streams across the floodplain, which create numerous islands. On the right bank a large island is created by Seacourt Stream, Botley Stream and Bulstake Stream, and there are smaller islands, including the large mainly built-up island now known as Osney, created by streams between Bulstake Stream and the Thames, including Osney Ditch. The Oxford suburbs of Grandpont and New Hinksey are on an island created by Bulstake Stream, Hinksey Stream and Weirs Mill Stream. Iffley Meadows is an island west of Iffley Lock, between Weirs Mill Stream, Hinksey Stream and the Thames.

On the left bank Fiddler&#x27;s Island followed downstream by the built-up island historically known as Osney lie between Castle Mill Stream and the Thames. Cripley Meadow is also on an island formed by Fiddler&#x27;s Island Stream, Castle Mill Stream and Sheepwash Channel.

==Eton and Dorney==
The status of Eton, Berkshire combined with Dorney is controversial. These are two mainly pre-1900-built small villages and their outlying localities: Eton Wick, Boveney and Dorney Reach. Much of these areas of land in the 19th century was marked by the Ordnance Survey &quot;liable to floods&quot; which led to pressure on authorities for flood protection, along with the more densely populated right bank.

They have been, since 2002, on a more protected man-made island formed by the Jubilee River, which is sometimes seen as an advanced flood relief channel rather than a channel of the Thames. As the Jubilee River is maintained with flow at all times, they may be coming to be accepted by publications as on an island of the Thames, reflecting their objective strict geographical status.

==Lock islands==
The construction of almost all locks on the Thames involved one or more artificial lock islands separating the lock from the weirs. These may have been created by building an artificial island in the river or by digging an artificial canal to contain the lock and turning the land between that and the river into an island. In many cases the lock island contains the lock keeper&#x27;s house and can be accessed across the lock gates. Such lock islands are only listed above if they have a specific name of their own: all Thames locks are listed in Locks on the River Thames.

<doc id="1228541" wikidata="Q1501615" url="?curid=1228541" title="Albany, New Zealand">
<text>Albany ( ) () is one of the northernmost suburbs of the contiguous Auckland metropolitan area in New Zealand. It is located on the North Shore, northwest of the Auckland city centre. Albany is found at the headlands of Lucas Creek, and was the location of a portage used by Tāmaki Māori, where waka could be taken between the Upper Waitematā Harbour and the Okura River/Hauraki Gulf. During the 1840s, early European settlers established the village of Lucas Creek, which by the 1880s had become a major fruit growing centre in Auckland. The town voted to change the name from Lucas Creek to Albany in 1890.

During the 1960s, large areas of farmland in Albany were requisitioned for a state housing project. The project was never built, and the land stayed vacant until the 1990s, when it was sold to private developers. Albany rapidly developed in the 1990s and 2000s, during which major projects were constructed, including Westfield Albany and North Harbour Stadium. Much of the land to the north of Albany is semi-rural.

Albany is divided into four areas: Albany, Albany Heights, Albany Village, and Albany Centre. The two former names are official.

==Etymologies==

From the 1840s until 1890, the settlement was known as Lucas Creek, named after early pioneer Daniel Clucas, who arrived in early 1840s and established a flax mill on the upper Lucas Creek at Albany. Over time, the name Lucas Creek developed bad associations, due to the moonshine operations that operated along the waterway. In 1890, the townspeople voted to change the name from Lucas Creek to Albany, a name suggested by Captain Alexander McArthur, which was suggested due to its associations with Albany, Western Australia, then a major horticulture centre. Albany in Western Australia was named after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, second son of King George III, in 1832. The name Lucas Creek was still in popular use in the early 20th century, and for many years the name appeared hyphenated as Albany-Lucas Creek in institutions and businesses.

Three Māori language names are associated with the Albany area. is the most commonly used name in modern contexts, including the North Shore Ōkahukura District Court, Albany Community Hub Te Pokapū ā-Hapori o Ōkahukura, and a Fletcher Living housing development in Albany. Originally a name for the Lucas Creek estuary, the name refers to the Ngāti Manuhiri (ancestress) Te Kura, the wife of Mataahu, who was the uncle to Manuhiri, the eponymous ancestor of the iwi. The word in Māori usually refers to rainbows or butterflies. Additionally, Lucas Creek is also referred to as (&quot;Stream for Eating Flounder&quot;). Another common name for the Albany area is (&quot;Of Te Ha&quot;), referring to Ngāti Manuhiri ancestor Te Ha Kaiaraara, grandson of Manuhiri. was the name of a kāinga in the Ōteha Valley.

==Geography==
Albany is a suburb of the North Shore of New Zealand. It is located in the upper reaches of the Lucas Creek, an estuarial arm of the Upper Waitematā Harbour, and in the Ōteha Valley. The Oteha Stream is a tributary of Lucas Creek that flows through southern Albany, which in turn has a tributary, Alexandra Stream, which flows north through Rosedale and joins the Oteha Stream at Albany. The highest point in the suburb is along Corban Avenue, which reaches a height of above sea level. Albany is bordered the Auckland Northern Motorway to the east and Rosedale Road in the south.

Much of the Albany area is formed from Early Miocene Waitemata Group sandstone and mudstone, with areas of conglomerate rock called Albany Conglomerate. The banks of the Lucas Creek were historically kauri-dominated forests. By the mid-19th century, the area had developed into a mānuka and fern-dominated scrubland. Some forest remnants can be found around Albany, such as the Fernhill Escarpment, which includes tōtara trees estimated to be 800 years old.

==History==
===Māori history===

Māori settlement of the Auckland Region began around the 13th or 14th centuries. The North Shore was settled by Tāmaki Māori, including people descended from the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory canoe and ancestors of figures such as Taikehu and Peretū. Many of the early Tāmaki Māori people of the North Shore identified as Ngā Oho, and the Lucas Creek has significance to modern iwi including Ngāti Manuhiri, Te Kawerau ā Maki and Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara. The poor clay soils of the area were not suitable for Māori traditional gardening techniques, but the creek was a good source for eels, crayfish and flounder.

An (traditional path) connected Lucas Creek and the Ōkura River to the north, which led to Long Bay and the upper Hauraki Gulf. This was used as a portage, where waka could be hauled overland between the two bodies of water, Numerous archaeological sites are found on the banks of the Lucas Creek and the Ōteha valley, because of its importance as a transportation node, which follows the ridge line of Lonely Track Road. The upper Lucas Creek area was the location of several kāinga, of which one had the name (&quot;Of Te Ha&quot;), referring to Ngāti Manuhiri ancestor Te Ha Kaiaraara, grandson of Manuhiri.

The warrior Maki migrated from the Kāwhia Harbour to his ancestral home in the Auckland Region, likely sometime in the 17th century. Maki conquered and unified many the Tāmaki Māori tribes as Te Kawerau ā Maki, including those of the North Shore. After Maki&#x27;s death, his sons settled different areas of his lands, creating new hapū. His younger son Maraeariki settled the North Shore and Hibiscus Coast, who based himself at the head of the Ōrewa River. Maraeariki&#x27;s daughter Kahu succeeded him, and she is the namesake of the North Shore, (&quot;The Greater Lands of Kahu&quot;), Many of the iwi of the North Shore, including Ngāti Manuhiri, Ngāti Maraeariki, Ngāti Kahu, Ngāti Poataniwha, Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki and Ngāti Whātua, can trace their lineage to Kahu.

By the first half of the 19th century, the mouth of the Lucas Creek to the southwest of Albany was one of the most densely settled areas of the North Shore by Tāmaki Māori peoples. During the early 1820s, most Māori of the North Shore fled for the Waikato or Northland due to the threat of war parties during the Musket Wars. When Tāmaki Māori returned in greater numbers to the Auckland Region in the mid-1830s, Te Kawerau ā Maki focused settlement at Te Henga / Bethells Beach.

===Early European settlement: kauri logging and gum digging===
The Albany area was a part of the Mahurangi Block, which was purchased by the New Zealand Government in 1841. While kauri logging was one of the first industries in the area, the supply of kauri was exhausted by the early 1840s. By the late 1840s, kauri gum digging had become a more prominent industry for the Lucas Creek area. Itinerant gum diggers would scour the area for kauri resin to sell at stores, including one located at Schnapper Rock. The first permanent resident in modern-day Albany was William Webster. Daniel Clucas arrived early 1840s, setting up a flax mill at Lucas Creek. While Lucas Creek is names after Clucas, he had left the Auckland area by 1846. Gradually a small settlement developed at the Lucas Creek headwaters; in 1844 three permanent residents lived here, which had increased to 24 by 1857.

Lucas Creek township was the local commercial centre for the upper west North Shore, due to the Lucas Creek wharf acting as the main link to the outside world. Ferries took goods and passengers along the Lucas Creek, which connected the village and surrounding areas to Auckland, and a rough overland track connected Lucas Creek township to Birkenhead and Northcote. By the 1860s a church, hotel, school and post office had opened in the village. Most early residents of Lucas Creek came from Great Britain and Ireland, with a small number arriving from Norway in the 1870s.

Albany School, which first began operating in 1865 out of a building called Bruce&#x27;s Shed, had a permanent school build built in 1876. By the 1880s, the school building had become a community hub for events attended by members of the surrounding communities, such as social dances and phrenology lectures, much to the objection of the Board of Education, who disapproved of the school being used for entertainment purposes.

===Fruit growing and rural Albany===

While the first orchards were established at Albany in the 1850s, fruit growing only became a major industry for the village in the 1880s, after gum digging and flax processing industries became less prominent. Fruit crops were varied, and included peaches, apples, pears, plums, loquats, cherries, quince and almonds.

On 1 December 1890, the township of Lucas Creek officially changed its name to Albany. The name Lucas Creek had developed an unsavory reputation during the 19th century, associated with rough living, and illicit moonshine breweries located along the creek. The name Albany was suggested by Captain Alexander McArthur, referencing Albany, Western Australia, then a major horticulture centre, as McArthur saw similarities between the two areas.

By the 1890s, Albany had become the leading fruit growing area in Auckland. 30,000 to 50,000 cases of apples and pears were being produced each year, with many being exported to Australia. The Albany Fruitgrowers Association formed in 1893, and became a major influencing force in the township, including the establishment of a new post office, and lobbying for road widening projects. 1894 saw the first Fruit &amp; Flower Show, an important local event which grew into the Albany A&amp;P Show. In 1895, Albany resident George Pannill created the Albany Surprise, a variety of grape based on the American isabella. The variety was a success, becoming the most commonly eaten table grape in New Zealand in the early 20th century. The success of the Albany Surprise was followed by the Albany Beauty apple, created by Mark Phillips on Gills Road, at the turn of the century after discovering the variety growing on what was meant to be a Gravenstein apple tree. In addition to these popular crops, large blackberry and strawberry farms became a major fixture of rural Albany by the early 1900s.

Albany fell under the jurisdiction of the Waitemata County, a vast local government area covering West Auckland, Rodney and the North Shore. Residents strongly objected to the actions of the county council, feeling ignored and frustrated at the lack of roading infrastructure in Albany. The first metalled road to Albany was constructed in 1890.

In 1911, the George V Coronation Hall was opened as a local community centre, and operated as a venue for the annual Albany Agricultural Show. This was joined in 1922 with the Albany War Memorial Library, constructed to remember the fallen World War I soldiers of Albany and surrounding areas.

By 1915, North Shore roads had improved enough that regular vehicle traffic began. Over the next 15 years, river traffic decreased, and in 1930 the Kaipatiki ferry ceased operation, and the historic Albany wharf, known as the Landing, was demolished soon after. In the 1930s, dairy farms began replacing Albany&#x27;s orchards and strawberry farms.

===Suburbanisation===
Albany saw a population influx post World War II, including many British and Dutch migrants to New Zealand. Many new residents in Albany sought out the area in order to live on semi-rural lifestyle blocks close to Auckland. New shops began opening in the township, including the two-storey Hillinds Building, and the Albany Pony Club began operating in 1954.

In 1959, the Auckland Harbour Bridge opened, leading to widescale development across the North Shore. Compared to surrounding areas, most notably the East Coast Bays, growth was much slower in Albany. After the construction of the bridge, the Auckland Northern Motorway was gradually opened, leading to Albany being much more closely connected to Auckland City. During this period, the North Shore Golf Club was established in Albany, after the Municipal Golf Course had been removed during motorway construction.

In 1963, the Second National Government of New Zealand requisitioned of Albany under the Public Works Act, in order to construct state housing. Earthworks were carried out and topsoil removed, but in 1969 work stopped, and plans for the state housing area were abandoned. The former farmland was left idle and unused for the next 20 years, until the establishment of North Shore City. In 1974, after Albany had become a rural area of Takapuna City, Labour Minister of Works Hugh Watt announced further land in Albany would be requisitioned for housing projects, which Albany residents strongly objected to.

The 1970s saw significant businesses and organisations come to Albany. Allan Clarks Motors was founded 1974 and became the largest private car dealership in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s. In the same year, Graeme Platt established the first commercial native plant nursery in New Zealand. Many of his plants were local to the Albany area, including the tōtara cultivar Aurea, also known by the name Albany Gold. In 1978, the private school Kristin School moved its campus from Campbells Bay to Albany.

Centrepoint was established as a commune in 1977, and at its peak had over 200 residents. In the 1990s, commune leaders including founder Bert Potter were charged on child sexual abuse and drug charges. The commune was shut down in 2000.

===Intense development===
Albany became the fastest developing area of the North Shore in the 1990s. Strawberry and dairy farms were redeveloped into lifestyle blocks and intensive housing, beginning in the late 1980s, and in 1994 the Albany Fruitgrowers Association disbanded, after operating for 100 years. In 1993, the North Shore City Council unveiled a 20 year plan for developing Albany, which included the New Zealand Housing Corporation selling the land requisitioned under the Public Works Act in the 1960s to private developers. Albany&#x27;s population increased from 9,000 in 1991 to 14,000 in 1998.

In March 1993, Massey University&#x27;s Albany Campus was opened, and 1997 saw the construction of both the North Harbour Stadium and the Albany Shopping Centre (now known as Westfield Albany). Further intensive developments were announced in 2005, and the Albany Shopping Centre was greatly expanded by 2007 to cover , including over 140 retailers including Farmers, Kmart, New World and JB Hi-Fi. Development in Albany slowed with the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

In 2007, the Upper Harbour Motorway was opened, creating a motorway connection between West Auckland and the North Shore via Greenhithe. In 2008, the Northern Busway was opened along the Northern Motorway, which included the Albany busway station.

==Local government==

From 1876 until 1954, the area was administered by the Waitemata County, a large rural county north and west of the city of Auckland. On 1 August 1974, the Waitemata County was dissolved, and Albany became a rural area incorporated into Takapuna City. In 1989, Albany was merged into the North Shore City. North Shore City was amalgamated into Auckland Council in November 2010.

Within the Auckland Council, Albany is a part of the Upper Harbour local government area governed by the Upper Harbour Local Board. It is a part of the Albany ward, which elects two councillors to the Auckland Council.

Kell Park reserve next to the new Albany Village Library was known for its free-range bantam chicken population, and pirate ship flying fox playground. The bantams have led to bantam-themed logos and a rooster statue in Albany. By 2008, the free-roaming chicken population had been removed.

The Fernhill Escarpment is a large nature reserve in Albany, on the north-east bank of the Oteha Stream. Large tōtara trees can be found here, with some estimated to be 800 years old.

<text>Easton is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Itchen Valley, in the Winchester district, in the county of Hampshire, England, situated on the River Itchen, 2¾ miles north east of Winchester. In 1931 the parish had a population of 408. On 1 April 1932 the parish was abolished to form Itchen Valley.

In 1870–72, John Goring&#x27;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Easton like this:

:&quot;EASTON, a village and a parish in Winchester district, Hants. The village stands on the river Itchen, near the Southwestern railway, 2¾ miles NE by N of Winchester; is small and uninteresting; and has a post office under Winchester. The parish comprises 2,734 acres [11 km²]. Real property, £3, 656. Pop., 455. Houses, 106. The property is much subdivided. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Winchester. Value, £514.* Patron, the Bishop of Winchester. The church is late Norman; has a rich south doorway, and an apsidal vaulted chancel; contains a monument to Bishop Barlow&#x27;s widow, recording that her five daughters were all married to bishops; and was restored in 1850. There is a Wesleyan chapel.&quot;

In 2010 Easton remains a small village but underwent limited development during the inter and post-war period. The population has grown by about 300 since John Goring&#x27;s time. Around ten additional houses have been built since 2000, and the land price has rocketed, although planning restrictions are very strict. The church mentioned in the above passage still stands and operates. There are two pubs in the village (The Chestnut Horse and The Cricketers Inn, the former of which having been acquired by Avington Park after a period of disrepair and set to reopen in late 2023), a small auto-garage and a village hall. The hall performs various functions including crèche services, WI meetings, a pavilion for the village cricket team and is the venue for an annual pantomime. The hall has just been rebuilt, after a 5-year fund-raising drive by villagers.

<doc id="1228550" wikidata="Q604408" url="?curid=1228550" title="Madeleine (cake)">
<text>The madeleine (, or ) or petite madeleine () is a traditional small cake from Commercy and Liverdun, two communes of the Lorraine region in northeastern France.

Madeleines are very small sponge cakes with a distinctive shell-like shape acquired from being baked in pans with shell-shaped depressions. Madeleine-style cookies are popular in a number of culinary traditions. 

A génoise sponge cake batter is used. The flavour is similar to, but somewhat lighter than, sponge cake. Traditional recipes include very finely ground nuts, usually almonds. A variation uses lemon zest for a pronounced lemony taste.

British madeleines also use a génoise sponge cake batter but they are baked in dariole moulds. After cooking, these are coated in jam and desiccated coconut, and are usually topped with a glacé cherry.

==Invention==
===Legend===
Several legends are attached to the &quot;invention&quot; of the madeleines. They have tended to center on a female character named Madeleine who is said to have been in the service of an important character in the history of Lorraine – although there is no consensus over the last name of the cook nor the identity of the famous character. Some believe that the illustrious patron was 17th-century cardinal and rebel Paul de Gondi, who owned a castle in Commercy. Others think that the inventor was named Madeleine Paulmier, who is said to have been a cook in the 18th century for Stanislaus I, duke of Lorraine and exiled King of Poland. The story goes that, in 1755, Louis XV, son-in-law of the duke, charmed by the little cakes prepared by Madeleine Paulmier, named them after her, while his wife, Maria Leszczyńska, introduced them soon afterward to the court in Versailles. Much beloved by the royal family, they quickly conquered the rest of France. Yet other stories have linked the cake with the pilgrimage to Compostela, in Spain: a pilgrim named Madeleine is said to have brought the recipe from France to Compostela, or a cook named Madeleine is said to have offered little cakes in the shape of a shell to the pilgrims passing through Lorraine.

Other stories do not give the cake a Lorraine origin and lay its invention at the feet of pastry chef Jean Avice, who worked in the kitchens of Prince Talleyrand. Avice is said to have invented the madeleine in the 19th century by baking little cakes in moulds normally reserved for aspic.,

===First recipes===
The term madeleine, used to describe a small cake, seems to appear for the first time in France in the middle of the 18th century. In 1758, a French retainer of Lord Southwell, an Irish Jacobite refugee in France, was said to prepare &quot;cakes à la Madeleine and other small desserts&quot;.

The appearance of the madeleine is indicative of the increasing use of metal molds in European baking in the 18th century (see also Canelés), but the commercial success of the madeleine dates back to the early years of the 19th century. Several mentions of the madeleine are made by culinary writers during the Napoleonic era, in particular in the recipe books of Antonin Carême and by famous gastronomer Grimod de la Reynière.

In Commercy, the production at a large scale of madeleines is said to have begun in the 1760s. In addition to being sold at the rail station, thus accelerating their spread through the country, it is likely that the cakes were exported to Paris along with the marmalade from Bar-le-duc and the croquantes from Rheims. By the end of the 19th century, the madeleine is considered a staple of the diet of the French bourgeoisie.

==Literary reference==

In &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; (also known as &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;), author Marcel Proust uses madeleines to contrast involuntary memory with voluntary memory. The latter designates memories retrieved by &quot;intelligence&quot;, that is, memories produced by putting conscious effort into remembering events, people, and places. Proust&#x27;s narrator laments that such memories are inevitably partial, and do not bear the &quot;essence&quot; of the past. The most famous instance of involuntary memory by Proust is known as the &quot;episode of the madeleine&quot;, yet there are at least half a dozen other examples in &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;.

<text>TD Station (), formerly known as Harbour Station, is an arena located in the uptown area of Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. The arena is the home of the Saint John Sea Dogs of the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League. It was once the home of the American Hockey League&#x27;s Saint John Flames from 1993 until their relocation in 2003 and the Saint John Riptide (originally known as the Mill Rats) of the National Basketball League of Canada from 2011 to 2019. The arena opened in October 1993 to a gala and a concert by Aerosmith which was attended by over 7,000 people, a record that was broken in 2008 by Elton John who brought in 8,100 fans. Since opening, the arena has hosted concerts, hockey, basketball, figure skating, and a number of trade shows.

The arena sits on land that used to be part of Saint John Harbour, and partly derives its name from the city&#x27;s former Union Station passenger railway terminal. The station was located on the site and was used by both CNR and CPR trains, until it was demolished to make way for the Saint John Throughway as part of an urban redevelopment plan in the early 1970s. TD Station is connected by Saint John&#x27;s pedway system — the Inside Connection — to the major uptown malls, hotels, parking garages and offices, allowing patrons to park their vehicles away from the stadium and reach it on foot without going outdoors.

In 2019, the arena gained a sponsor with the Toronto-Dominion Bank and Harbour Station was renamed TD Station.

==Design==

TD Station features two levels of seating, an &#x27;upper bowl&#x27; and a &#x27;lower bowl&#x27;. There are 11 rows of seating in the lower bowl level, 9-12 rows in the upper bowl level, with approximately 16 seats in each section in each level. TD Station has 13 luxury sky boxes, which were added before the 2005–2006 season. They also have the Alpine Room which is a private club located at the top of TD Station and has a lounge-type atmosphere with a full-service bar and food service. TD Station features an open concourse so it enables fans walking around, or in line for concessions to still view the game.

Seating capacity varies for different events at TD Station, with 6,307 seats available for hockey games, and 6,603 seats for basketball games. Seating capacity for concerts may range between 1,400 and around 8,100.

==Past events==
In the past, the arena has hosted: 
* The Skate Canada Championships in 1995.
* The 1997 AHL All-Star Game.
* The 1998 &amp; 2001 AHL Calder Cup Finals.
* The 1998 World Junior Figure Skating Championships.

<text>The Ausable River is a river in southwestern Ontario Canada which empties into Lake Huron at Port Franks, Ontario. The Ausable&#x27;s initial source is in a moraine near the community of Staffa, Ontario located in the municipality of West Perth, Ontario at a point above sea level. Although the river has a total measured length of over , because of its meandering course, the mouth in actuality is only from its source near Staffa. The Ausable drains of land, and falls in elevation from source to outlet.

In 1875, engineers of the Canada Company engaged in a large scale drainage project, referred to locally as &quot;The Cut&quot;, which altered the course of the river dramatically and permitted the draining of several local small lakes and wetlands for agricultural purposes. Before that time the Ausable passed through the village of Grand Bend, where it made an abrupt curve toward the south, paralleling the Lake Huron shoreline for several kilometers, before entering the lake at Port Franks. This abrupt &quot;bend&quot; in the course of the river, is the origin of the name of the community of Grand Bend. The former course of the river, sections of which almost completely dry up during the summer season, can still be seen in Pinery Provincial Park. It is referred to as the Old Ausable Channel.

The river provides habitat for several endangered freshwater mussel species, several threatened or endangered fish species and the threatened eastern spiny softshell turtle.

The formation of the Ausable Gorge by the river near Arkona has exposed fossils from the Middle Devonian period. At one time, a hydroelectric plant was located at nearby Rock Glen Falls.

This river was called Rivière aux Sables or &quot;sandy river&quot; by the French which through time became the Aux Sables River in English. The name was condensed to Ausable in the early 20th century.

The Anishinaabeg who signed Huron Tract Treaty #29 referred to the river as “Niigaanziibii” / Niigaansibiing” and the river is the eastern boundary of the Stony Point reserve which is 1/2 of the land base for the Anishinaabeg Of Kettle and Stony Point First Nations Band (Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation -CKSPFN).

<doc id="1228580" wikidata="Q172174" url="?curid=1228580" title="Guy Ligier">
<text>Guy Camille Ligier (; 12 July 1930 – 23 August 2015) was a French racing driver and team owner. He maintained many varied and successful careers over the course of his life, including rugby player, butcher, racing driver and Formula One team owner.

He is the father of Philippe and Pascale Ligier and the grand father of Etienne Ligier former French motorsport hopeful.

==The early years==
The son of a farmer, Ligier was orphaned at 7 years of age. He left school in his mid-teens and went to work as a butcher&#x27;s assistant in his home town of Vichy.

Athletic and competitive, he became a French rowing champion in 1947. He also had a passion for rugby and was good enough to play for the French Army during National Service earning a place on the French national B team. His rugby career was cut short due to injuries.

Determined to become successful, Ligier saved all of the money he earned working as a butcher to fund his aspirations. In 1960, he rented a backhoe and, a short time later, bought a bulldozer of his own and went into the construction business.

With help from Pierre Coulon, Vichy&#x27;s Mayor, he founded the public works company &quot;Ligier Travaux Publics&quot;. With motorway construction booming in France, Ligier was able to rapidly expand his business. By 1961, he had 1200 employees and 500 machines and had also diversified into bridges, dams and development. During this period, his business contacts allowed him to make important friends in (then) local politicians François Mitterrand and Pierre Bérégovoy.

When his rugby career ended, he switched to racing but on motorcycles. He would win the French Motorbike Championship in the 500cc class riding a Norton Manx &quot;LA&quot; in 1959 and in 1960.

==Racing driver==
Ligier made an early foray into auto racing with a Simca 1300 at the 1957 Parisian Salon Cups in Montlhéry, but it was in 1960 that he first tried his hand at single-seater racing with a Formula Junior Elva-DKW, which he drove at Monaco and Montlhéry.

By 1964 Ligier was racing Porsche sportscars as part of Auguste Veuillet&#x27;s team, starting with a 356 and then a 904 Carrera GTS, in which he placed 7th with Robert Buchet at the 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans. That same year Ford France signed Ligier to drive one of two Formula 2 Brabham BT6 cars. These were year-old models, but one would be replaced by a newer Brabham BT10 during the season. Ligier&#x27;s teammate was Jo Schlesser. Ligier finished fifth in his debut at Enna-Pergusa. So at the relatively late age of 34 Ligier began his &quot;real&quot; career as a driver.

In 1965 he won the 24th Grand Prix de Albi Sports in a GT40 for Ford. In 1966 he drove Shelby Mustang GT350 chassis 5R209 rented to Martial Delalande to a second-place finish in the 14th &quot;Rallye des Routes du Nord&quot;.

Ligier broke into Formula One as a privateer, entering his own Cooper-Maserati T81 in the 1966 Monaco Grand Prix. In five starts with this car he either ran unclassified or out of the points. That year he and Schlesser also joined forces to become the exclusive importer of Ford-Shelby products to France.

Teaming with Schlesser in a Ford France GT40 again that year produced good results – a fifth-place finish at the Nürburgring 1000 km. Although his year was ended by a knee broken while practicing for the German GP, things could have been worse. Following the crash doctors had wanted to amputate and it was only through the intervention of Schlesser that the leg was saved.

In 1967 Ligier fielded another car of his own, a Brabham-Repco BT20, in the British Grand Prix. His (effective) sixth-place finish in Germany produced the only championship point of his F1 career. Ligier also won the 12 Hours of Reims when sharing a GT40 Mk IIB with Schlesser.

In 1968 Ligier drove a Ford Escort TC in the Coupes de Vitesse. That was the same year that Ford France was winding down its motorsports involvement, so Ligier partnered with Schlesser and José Behra to launch Ecurie InterSport with a pair of McLaren Formula 2 cars. Schlesser was killed that year in his Formula One debut at the French Grand Prix while at the wheel of the magnesium-bodied air-cooled Honda RA302 Formula One car. The shocking loss of his friend prompts Ligier to retire from racing.

Ligier had one outing in a Ford Escort TC in the 1969 Coupes de l&#x27;ACIF, but he returned to regular competition in 1970 for the 24 Hours of Le Mans in a car bearing his own name, the Ligier JS1, and continued to participate in various endurance races with his own cars until 1974.

In total Ligier participated in thirteen Grand Prix Formula 1 races, getting one point in the drivers&#x27; world championship with an eighth-place finish in the German Grand Prix in 1966 due to the two finishers in front of him being F2 cars, and so ineligible for F1 points.

==Other racing wins==
* GT Class win in Coupes du Salon 1963 (de Montlhéry, in a Porsche 356 Carrera);
* 1964 Coupes de vitesse (de Montlhéry, in a Porsche 904 GTS);
* Magny-Cours 1965 (in a Ford GT40);
* Grand Prix d&#x27;Albi 1965 (in a Ford GT40, hors championnat d&#x27;Europe);
* Class S win (3L) at 1000 kilometres of Nürburgring 1966 in a Ford GT40 with Schlesser (fifth);
* Class S win (&gt;2L) at 1000 kilometres of Monza 1967 in a Ford GT40 with Schlesser (sixth);
* 12 Heures de Reims, 1967 in a Ford Mk.IIB with Schlesser;
* Special Class win in 1969 Coupes de vitesse (Montlhéry, in a Ford Escort TC).

==Constructor and team owner==
In 1968 Ligier established &quot;Ligier Cars&quot; to build his own sports-racing cars in fulfillment of the dream that he and former teammate, business partner and close friend, the late Jo Schlesser had shared to build a &quot;good car&quot;. Ligier hired Michel Têtu to design the cars, and the first car produced was the JS1 prototype, the &quot;JS&quot; in this and all subsequent names being a tribute to Schlesser. Only three JS1s were built before production switched to its successor, the JS2.

The JS3 racing prototype was actually built in the time between the JS1 and JS2. Following limited success in the sports-racing field Ligier turned his attention to Formula 1 when he bought the assets of Equipe Matra Sports. With the experienced team, including designer Gerard Ducarouge and the Matra V12 engine Ligier formed Équipe Ligier in 1976. The team became successful in the early 1980s with drivers Jacques Laffite, Patrick Depailler and Didier Pironi.

In 1981 Ligier&#x27;s old friend François Mitterrand became President of France. When Ligier ran into trouble in 1983 the President ordered that government-owned companies such as Elf, Gitanes and Loto should supply sponsorship. Ligier also had preferential treatment when it came to engines, political pressure being applied to Renault to force the company to supply the team, which used Renault engines from 1984 to 1986 and from 1992 to 1994. However, this did not always give them the latest and greatest of the available Renault engines. Due to exclusive contracts with Lotus during the original turbo era (1977-1988) and with Williams in the 3.5L era (1989-1994), Ligier usually only got the previous year&#x27;s engines to race, though with the demise of the Renault factory team after , Ligier would (from about halfway through the season) get the newest engines along with Lotus in . 

The Ligier-Mitterrand-Bérégovoy alliance reached its peak in the early 1990s with the reconstruction of the Magny-Cours racing circuit as a new headquarters for Ligier and as a racing circuit to host the French Grand Prix. President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Bérégovoy backed the idea.

At the 1996 Grand Prix of Monaco driver Olivier Panis won the ninth and final Formula 1 victory for Ligier.

Equipe Ligier managed to contest 326 Grand Prix races, make 50 podiums appearances, notch 9 victories, claim second place in the 1980 World Championship and build over 20 Formula 1 cars. It was also home to an illustrious list of drivers over the eighteen years that it competed under the Ligier name.

==Post-Formula 1 life==
Following the demise of the Monica car company in 1975, Ligier purchased the French assets and remaining unassembled vehicles. Ligier did not resume production of the Monica.

Having built a variety of sports-racing and Formula 1 cars, Ligier began to diversify his automobile company in the 1980s. Beginning with tractor cabs, the Ligier Group later began production of &quot;voitures sans permis&quot; or &quot;voiturettes&quot;, a class of microcar in France that may be driven without an operator&#x27;s license, with the release of the Ligier JS4. The two-door JS4 has a nearly cubic steel monococque and a glass rear door, and was originally equipped with a 49 cc Motobécane engine. It was short and quite wide, reflecting recent legal changes allowing &quot;voitures sans permis&quot; to seat two rather than just one.

In 1992 Ligier realized that the socialist government would not last forever and sold his team to Cyril de Rouvre (The team was sold again in 1994 to Flavio Briatore). Ligier used the money from the sale to corner the market in natural fertilizer in central France and set about building another fortune.

Within a few months Mitterrand&#x27;s Socialist Party experienced a major loss in the elections and Bérégovoy committed suicide on 1 May 1993. Ligier remained involved with the old Formula 1 team in an ambassadorial role until it was sold yet again, this time to Alain Prost in February 1997 and renamed Prost Grand Prix.

In 2004, Ligier acquired a majority shareholding in Automobiles Martini, adding his &quot;Ligier JS&quot; naming to new models such as the Ligier JS49, JS51 and JS53.

The name Ligier returned to the motor racing spotlight in 2014 when Jacques Nicolet&#x27;s Onroak Automotive began building cars. Some were campaigned by Nicolet&#x27;s own OAK Racing, which fielded a Ligier JS P2 prototype running in FIA World Endurance Championship and 24 Hours of Le Mans with Nicolet and Jean-Marc Merlin driving.

Ligier&#x27;s son had also become a constructor of Formula 3 cars.

Following his death on 23 August 2015 in Nevers his funeral took place at the church of St. Blaise de Vichy on 28 August 2015.

Ligier was survived by his wife and their two children, son Philippe and daughter Pascale.

<text>Muriwai, also called Muriwai Beach, is a coastal community on the west coast of the Auckland Region in the North Island of New Zealand. The black-sand surf beach and surrounding area is a popular recreational area for Aucklanders. The Muriwai Regional Park includes a nesting site for a large colony of gannets.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;water&#x27;s end&quot; for &quot;Muriwai&quot;.

== Geology ==

The Muriwai area was uplifted from the sea floor between 3 and 5 million years ago. Much of the landscape is formed by remnants of the eastern side of the Waitākere Volcano, notably the pillow lava formations seen along the cliffs south of Muriwai beach. The area is primarily formed by sand, sedimentary rock and piha conglomerate. Cliff walls dominate much of southern Muriwai. Muriwai Beach has black sand, caused by the iron content derived from the ancient volcanoes in the area, including the large Kaipara Volcano which was situated offshore from the Kaipara Heads, and erupted 23-16 million years ago. The black sand is moved up the west coast of the North Island by longshore drift.

Oaia Island is an island located off the coast of Muriwai.

Motutara Island at Muriwai is a rare mainland colony for Australasian gannets. The rare korowai gecko is endemic to Muriwai area, primarily found in the sand dunes of Muriwai Beach.

== History ==
The Muriwai area is traditionally a part of rohe of the Tāmaki Māori tribe Te Kawerau ā Maki, known originally by the name One Rangatira (&quot;The Chiefly Beach&quot;), referring to the tohunga Rakatāura&#x27;s visit to the beach. The beach has spiritual significance to Te Kawerau ā Maki, as it is a part of Te Rerenga Wairua, the pathway that souls take to Cape Reinga to depart the world.

Te Kawerau ā Maki and Ngāti Whātua fought over the area when the latter settled south of the Kaipara Harbour. Muriwai became known as the border between Te Kawerau ā Maki and Ngāti Whātua, when peace was struct by the Te Kawerau ā Maki chief Te Hawiti / Te Au o Te Whenua. The area was settled by Ngāti Te Kahupara, a Ngāti Whātua hapū with Kawerau ancestry, until the 20th century.

The southern Muriwai Beach area was also known as Paenga Tohorā, referring to the many whale strandings that happened in the location. Te Au o Te Whenua lived at Te Korekore, a headland pā located at the south end of the beach. He was known for collecting and drying &quot;Paphies ventricosa&quot; (toheroa) collected from the Muriwai area, which he would trade with other Tāmaki Māori iwi and hapū for delicacies. The gannet colony headland was known as Ōtakamiro, the location of a pā named after the ancestor Takamiro. Other pā and villages to the south-east of the beach included Matuakore, Te Toheriri, Ngārihariha and Tirikohua. The modern name, Muriwai, means &quot;End of the Water&quot;. It refers to the Te Muriwai, a kāinga located upstream of the beach along Ōkiritoto Stream, which over time became a name for the river valley, and eventually for the wider area.

During the late 19th century, John Foster established a flax mill at Muriwai, stopping in 1893 when this became less economically viable. In 1894 Muriwai Valley School was established. The school only operated part-time, due to the school&#x27;s rural location. At the turn of the century, politician and Mayor of Auckland City Edwin Mitchelson constructed a wooden mansion at Muriwai which he named Oaia, referencing adjacent Oaia Island.

During World War II, the New Zealand Government feared that the Japanese army could invade Auckland along the west coast, landing at Muriwai. During this period, a United States Marine Corps camp was established at Muriwai, in part due to these fears.

In 1962, Muriwai became the location where the COMPAC submarine communications cable connected Auckland to Sydney, and a repeater station was installed 3 km from Muriwai Beach. This was used until 5 October 1983, when a cable fault at Sydney caused the system to cease working.

In February 2013, filmmaker Adam Strange was killed at Muriwai Beach while swimming about 200m offshore, when he was attacked by a small group of great white sharks. As a result, Muriwai Beach was closed for a number of days. Initial reports suggested the culprit was a bronze whaler, but it was later deemed more likely a great white was to blame. It was the first fatal shark attack in more than three decades in New Zealand.

Muriwai was badly damaged by Cyclone Gabrielle in February 2023. Two volunteer firefighters were killed by a landslip during the cleanup.

== Location ==
Muriwai is approximately 17 km west of Kumeū, 42 kilometres northwest of Auckland city, at the southern end of an unbroken 50 kilometre stretch of beach which extends up the Tasman Sea coast to the mouth of the Kaipara Harbour.
One of several popular beaches in the area (others include Piha and Karekare), it experiences a population explosion in summer when Aucklanders head to the sea. It is in the Rodney Ward of the Auckland Region.

== Governance ==
Muriwai is part of the Local Government Rodney Ward of Auckland Council and is part of the Kumeu Subdivision of the Rodney Local Board. Muriwai is in the Kaipara ki Mahurangi electorate. (Previously Helensville electorate.)

<text>Praga-Południe (), also known by its anglicized names Praga-South, Praga South, and South Praga, is a district of the city of Warsaw, Poland located on the east bank of the Vistula River. It consists of Grochów, Gocław, Kamionek and Saska Kępa.

== History ==

The area of today&#x27;s Praga-South has been inhabited since at least the 7th century. There are traces of settlements established earlier than Warsaw itself. However, the swampy and often flooded terrain was deserted as soon as Warsaw was founded. Since the 16th century it was again populated, but due to lack of communication with Warsaw (until the 19th century there were no permanent bridges across the Vistula at Warsaw) it was an unimportant suburb.

It shared the fate of a greater area named Praga, which was the easternmost suburb of Warsaw. In the 17th century one of the areas of present Praga-South was turned into a military camp. In the 18th century part of the area was named Saska Kępa (literally &quot;Saxon Rise&quot;) after the Saxon Guards of the Kings of Poland stationed there.

Until the early 20th century the area retained its rural character. The area officially became a part of Warsaw in 1916. It soon became one of fastest-growing areas of Warsaw and Saska Kępa became its centre. In the 1920s and 1930s it became one of the most popular villa areas of the Warsaw&#x27;s middle class.

During and after World War II the district was not destroyed. Despite several plans, it was not industrialised either, which allowed the district to retain much of its original quiet and peaceful character. Currently there are several new areas with luxurious blocks of flats in the area, but the authorities do not plan to construct more houses and want the character to be preserved.

Apart from the Saska Kępa architecture, the main attractions of the borough are the Kazimierz Górski National Stadium, Skaryszew Park, Kamionek Lake and the Olszynka Grochowska reserve. The battlefield of the Battle of Olszynka Grochowska (1831) and the 2B Jerzego Waszyngtona Avenue Skyscraper is also located within the district.

== Neighbourhoods within the district ==
* Kamionek
* Saska Kepa
* Gocław
* Gocławek
* Grochów
* Olszynka Grochowska

<text>The Type 95 torpedo was a torpedo used by submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II.

The Type 95 was based on the Type 93 torpedo (&quot;Long Lance&quot;); its mod 1 had a smaller and mod 2 had a larger warhead size than the Type 93&#x27;s . The Type 95 was similar to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s contemporary Mark 16 hydrogen peroxide torpedo, which had a shorter range, slightly lower top speed and a larger and nearly twice as powerful warhead at 580 kg filled with TORPEX or HBX/HBX-3 explosive. It was intended to be fired from a standard torpedo tube of a submerged submarine.

The range of the Type 95 was (for the mod 1) at , or at ,
which was about three times the range of the U.S. Navy Mark 14 with the same speed at 45 to 47 knots.

The Type 95 was the fastest torpedo in common use by any navy during World War II. Its warhead size was the largest of any submarine torpedo, and second only to the Type 93 used by Japanese surface ships. Its engine was a kerosene-oxygen wet-heater rather than the compressed air used by most torpedo types at the time.

<text>Ellen von Unwerth (born 1954) is a German photographer. She began her career as a fashion model, before becoming a fashion, editorial, and advertising photographer.

== Early life and education ==
Von Unwerth was born in Frankfurt, West Germany. As an orphan, during her early childhood, she often ended up in Bavarian foster care systems. Eventually, von Unwerth was able to graduate high school in Munich, where she would work as a circus magician&#x27;s assistant for three years.

==Modelling==
At the age of twenty while walking down the street, von Unwerth was asked by a photographer if she ever thought about having a modeling career. She decided to give modeling a chance and moved to Paris where she had a successful modeling career for 7 years.

== Photography ==

However, von Unwerth felt that as a model, she did not have the freedom to decide where and how her image would be used. Her boyfriend at the time gave her a camera, leading to an impromptu photo shoot in Kenya by her of her model colleagues. When the photos were published, von Unwerth decided that this was the new path she would take in life, as the demand for her photography skills outgrew her demand as a model.

Von Unwerth&#x27;s first notable work was when she first photographed Claudia Schiffer in 1989. Her work has been published in &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot;, &quot;The Face&quot;, &quot;Arena&quot;, &quot;Twill&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Uomo Vogue&quot;, &quot;I-D&quot;, and &quot;Playboy&quot;, and she has published several books of photography.

Von Unwerth did promotional photography for Duran Duran from 1994 to 1997 and did some photography for their 1990 album &quot;Liberty&quot; and 1997 album &quot;Medazzaland&quot;&quot;.&quot; Her work has been used on other album covers including Bananarama&#x27;s &quot;Pop Life&quot; (1991), Belinda Carlisle&#x27;s &quot;A Woman and a Man&quot; (1996), Cathy Dennis&#x27; &quot;Am I the Kinda Girl?&quot; (1996), Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; (1997), All Saints&#x27; &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; (2000), Dido&#x27;s &quot;Life for Rent&quot; (2003), Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Blackout&quot; (2007), Christina Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;Back To Basics&quot; (2006) and &quot;Keeps Gettin&#x27; Better: A Decade of Hits&quot; and Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Rated R&quot; and &quot;Talk That Talk.&quot; She also shot the cover of Hole&#x27;s album Live Through This (1994).

She shows women in ways without objectifying them. In an interview with &quot;V Magazine&quot;, she said: &quot;I never force women to do anything, but I give them roles to play so they are always active and empowered. In a 2018 interview with &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, she explained her feminist approach to photography: &quot;The women in my pictures are always strong, even if they are also sexy. My women always look self-assured. I try to make them look as beautiful as they can because every woman wants to feel beautiful, sexy and powerful. That&#x27;s what I try to do.&quot;

<text>TCN is the flagship television station of the Nine Network in Australia. The station is currently located at 1 Denison Street, North Sydney. The licence, issued to a company named Television Corporation Ltd headed by Sir Frank Packer, was one of the first four licences (two in Sydney, two in Melbourne) to be issued for commercial television stations in Australia. TCN-9 is the home of the NRL coverage and national-level Nine News bulletins.

==History==
TCN began broadcasting on 16 September 1956, and became the first television station in Australia to begin regular transmissions. Test broadcasts, initially consisting of a test slide and later documentaries and dramas, had commenced two months earlier on 13 July 1956. The first TV tower was built there at 24 Artarmon Rd, Willoughby, in 1956 and rose 171 m (561 ft) in height, but was replaced by a taller one in 1965 which is the tallest lattice tower in Australia at 233 m (764 ft), and is now operated by TXA Australia which operates another tower nearby at Artarmon.

The first words spoken on the station were by John Godson, who introduced the station audio-only, shortly before the first program, &quot;This Is Television&quot;, was introduced by Bruce Gyngell. As Godson&#x27;s voice only was heard, Gyngell (who spoke and was seen) is regarded as the first person to &quot;appear&quot; on Australian television. Original footage of Gyngell&#x27;s opening address is not believed to exist but it was re-created in 1959 to have a representation in the archives (albeit, not the real thing). Other early programming included the 1958 variety music program &quot;Bandstand&quot; which was launched by Brian Henderson. It lasted for 14 years on the station and launched the careers of many Australian performers.

In 1957, the station formed an affiliation with Melbourne station HSV-7, allowing them to share programming. In 1963, station affiliations changed; TCN-9 formed part of the National Television Network with GTV-9 in Melbourne, QTQ-9 in Brisbane and NWS-9 in Adelaide. These stations formed the basis of what is now the Nine Network, although only the Sydney and Melbourne stations were owned by the Packer-controlled company Nine Network Limited.

On Sir Frank Packer&#x27;s death in 1974 ownership of Nine Network passed to his younger son Kerry Packer. Kerry&#x27;s older brother Clyde Packer had been groomed to take over from their father but after a bitter split with his father ca. 1972 he relinquished his role in the company and subsequently moved to the USA.

On 2 March 1981 , the station began broadcasting at the Kingsgate Hyatt Tower (now Elan Building) on UHF channel 49, later moving to UHF channel 52 in February 1983 to allow for ABC and SBS to set up transmitters there. This transmitter was installed to cover areas of central Sydney where reception is affected by the ghosting caused by the high-rise buildings in Sydney&#x27;s central business district.

In January 1987, Kerry Packer sold the Sydney and Melbourne stations to Alan Bond&#x27;s Bond Media for $1.055 billion, including $200 million in shares of Bond Media. Bond already owned the Perth and Brisbane Nine affiliate stations (among others). In 1990, Bond Media&#x27;s inability to pay out preference shares to Packer forced Nine into receivership. In July 1990, Packer bought back the expanded Nine Network (Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane) for only $200 million, one-fifth of what he sold it for. Perth was not included due to Bond selling it to Sunraysia Television before Packer buying back the company.

In 1994, Packer&#x27;s print operations (owned by Australian Consolidated Press) and the Nine Network were merged into one new company, Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL). On 1 October 1997, TCN-9 performed the first on-air trial of digital broadcasting in the southern hemisphere.

TCN commenced digital television transmission on 1 January 2001, broadcasting on VHF Channel 8 while maintaining analogue transmission on VHF Channel 9.
The analogue signal for TCN was shut off at 9.00am AEDST, Tuesday, 3 December 2013.

In 2014 and 2015, TCN produced both &quot;Inside Story&quot; and &quot;The Verdict&quot; for the Nine Network, hosted by Leila McKinnon and Karl Stefanovic respectively. &quot;The Verdict&quot; did not build a solid audience and as expected the program was axed in 2016.

In January 2017, following the affiliation formed between Nine and Southern Cross in 2016, the station became home to the new &quot;Nine News&quot; Canberra and Southern NSW bulletins. The bulletins were anchored by Vanessa O&#x27;Hanlon.

In late 2018, It was announced that after 25 years on air, the Nine Network axed and retired &quot;The NRL Footy Show&quot;, bringing to an end 25 years of live primetime variety from the station.

It was also announced to public and then staff, that after 64 years in Willoughby, TCN would move to North Sydney. This move occurred in stages throughout the second half of 2020. The final broadcast of Sydney’s &quot;Nine News&quot; from Willoughby, took place on Friday 20 November 2020. The final broadcast from Willoughby was &quot;Weekend Today&quot; on Saturday 21 November 2020, with &quot;Nine News&quot; commencing at North Sydney that evening.

==News==
&quot;9News Sydney&quot; is TCN&#x27;s flagship nightly news bulletin presented by Peter Overton on Monday to Friday nights and Georgie Gardner on Saturday &amp; Sunday nights. Sports news is presented by James Bracey on Sunday to Thursday nights and Roz Kelly on Friday and Saturday nights. Amber Sherlock presents the weather on Sunday to Thursday nights and Belinda Russell on Friday and Saturday nights. Jayne Azzopardi and Mark Burrows are regular fill-in presenters.

Brian Henderson was Nine&#x27;s Sydney news presenter for a record 45 years - including 38 years presenting on weeknights. Retiring in November 2002, Henderson was succeeded as weeknight presenter by Jim Waley, who was at the time host of the &quot;Sunday&quot; program and was one of Nine&#x27;s most experienced presenters.

In January 2005, despite some considerable ratings success, Waley was replaced as weeknight presenter by Mark Ferguson, who was previously the weekend presenter. Ferguson&#x27;s successor as weekend presenter Mike Munro resigned in 2008 and was replaced by Michael Usher.

In 2009, following a continuing run of poor ratings, Ferguson was demoted to his former role as weekend news presenter, with Peter Overton taking over as news presenter on weeknights. Later in the year, Ferguson was removed from the presenting duties on the Sydney bulletins after announcing his decision to move to the Seven Network, but he didn&#x27;t move to Seven until he trialled the hosting duties on &quot;Nine&#x27;s Afternoon News&quot; only appearing on-air up until his departure on 25 September 2009.

Deborah Knight was appointed as Friday &amp; Saturday night presenter with Peter Overton now also presenting the Sunday night bulletin.

In 2011, &quot;Nine News Sydney&quot; officially overtook &quot;Seven News Sydney&quot; in the ratings for the first time in seven years, winning 26 weeks to Seven&#x27;s 14 weeks.

<doc id="1228624" wikidata="Q7621739" url="?curid=1228624" title="StrataCom">
<text>StrataCom, Inc. was a supplier of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Frame Relay high-speed wide area network (WAN) switching equipment. StrataCom was founded in Cupertino, California, United States, in January 1986, by 26 former employees of the failing Packet Technologies, Inc. StrataCom produced the first commercial cell switch, also known as a fast-packet switch. ATM was one of the technologies underlying the world&#x27;s communications systems in the 1990s.

==Origins of the IPX at Packet Technologies==
Internet pioneer Paul Baran was a founder of PacketCable and provided the spark of invention of packet voice at the initiation of the Integrated Packet Exchange (IPX) project. Packet voice was first thought of as an add-on to PacketCable&#x27;s advanced cable system but soon became a telephony product. PacketCable was renamed Packet Technologies as a result of the addition of the IPX project to the company. (StrataCom&#x27;s IPX communication system is unrelated to Novell&#x27;s IPX Internetwork Packet Exchange protocol.)

The IPX was initially known as the PacketDAX, which was a play on words of Digital access and cross-connect system (or DACS). A rich collection of inventions were contained in the IPX, and many were provided by the other members of the development team. The names on the original three IPX patents are Paul Baran, Charles Corbalis, Brian Holden, Jim Marggraff, Jon Masatsugu, David Owen and Pete Stonebridge. StrataCom&#x27;s implementation of ATM was pre-standard and used 24 byte cells instead of the 53 byte cells of the later standards-based ATM. However, many of concepts and details found in the ATM set of standards were derived directly from StrataCom&#x27;s technology, including the use of CRC-based framing on its links.

==The IPX development==
The IPX&#x27;s first use was as a 4-1 voice compression system. It implemented Voice-Activity-Detection (VAD) and ADPCM, which together, gave 4-1 compression allowing 96 telephone calls to be fit into the space of 24. The IPX was also used as an enterprise voice-data networking system as well as a global enterprise networking system. McGraw-Hill&#x27;s &quot;Data communications&quot; Magazine included the IPX in its list of &quot;20 Most Significant Communications Products of the Last 20 Years&quot; in a 1992 edition.

The Beta test of the IPX was in Michigan Bell between Livonia, Plymouth, and Northville, 3 suburbs of Detroit. The first customer shipment was to the May Company between department stores in San Diego and Los Angeles. The most significant early use of the IPX was as the backbone of the Covia/United Airlines flight reservation system. It also was used in multiple corporate networks including those of CompuServe, Intel and Hewlett-Packard. Covia and DEC resold the IPX. DEC invested in StrataCom in 1990.

==IPX Frame Relay Development==
The IPX&#x27;s most successful use was as the first Frame Relay networking product. It formed the core of the AT&amp;T and CompuServe Frame Relay networks. StrataCom was also involved in the standardization of Frame Relay as a technology in 1990. The FRP card that implemented Frame Relay was introduced in 1991 and perfected in 1992.

==The IPX product==
The cards in the original 1986 IPX system were:
* The PCC — The Processor Control Card — a Motorola 68000 based shelf control card
* The VDP — The Voice Data Processor — Implemented a VAD algorithm and packetized the voice
* The VCD — The Voice Compressor-Decompressor — Implemented ADPCM
* The TXR — The Transmit Receive Card — Implemented a T1 interface with packet queues
* The PIC — The Protection Interface Card — Allowed the T1 interfaces to be swapped

The cards in the 1989 second wave were:
* The SDP — The Synchronous Data Processor — added V.35, RS-422, and RS-232 data to the IPX. The name FDP referred to the combination of the SDP with a back card. The SDP was a very early use of Xilinx FPGAs, and StrataCom was their largest customer for a time.
* The CDP — The Circuit Data Processor — Added E1 and integrated echo cancellation

The card in the 1991 third wave was:
* The FRP — The Frame Relay Processor — Added Frame Relay to the IPX (implemented the SAR function in Motorola 56000 DSP&#x27;s)

==Public listing==
StrataCom went public in the fall of 1992 under the ticker symbol STRM. Three of its executives later formed SToRM Ventures. They were Tae HeaNahm, Ryan Floyd and Sanjay Subhedar 

==The BPX Development==
The BPX, which was produced in 1993, increased the speed and sophistication of the Frame Relay offering. It also supported the 53 byte cells of the ATM standard instead the IPX&#x27;s 24 byte cells. This product was used by AT&amp;T in their frame relay network.

==The IGX Development==
The original IPX product was sped-up with a bus adapter and re-introduced as the IGX.

==Acquisition by Cisco Systems==
Cisco Systems acquired StrataCom in 1996 for US$4 billion. The acquired employees formed the core of Cisco&#x27;s Multi-Service Switching Business Unit and helped to move Cisco more into the high-availability carrier equipment space from the enterprise equipment business that they had largely been in before the acquisition.

==StrataCom management==
StrataCom&#x27;s first CEO was Steve Campbell who later went to Packeteer. Dick Moley, who came from ROLM Corporation, served as its CEO for most of its existence. Dave Sant originally led sales, hiring Scott Kriens who later became CEO of Juniper Networks. Bill Stensrud was the founding Vice President of Marketing (and later became a managing partner of venture capital firm Enterprise Partners). 

==Locations==
The company was first located in Cupertino at 10341 Bubb Road. It then moved to Campbell at 3175 Winchester Boulevard and later to San Jose at 1400 Parkmoor Avenue. The company also had a manufacturing building in south San Jose built for it in 1996; this building was selected in 2006 by Nanosolar as the site of a large solar cell factory.

<doc id="1228626" wikidata="Q2985575" url="?curid=1228626" title="K9 (Doctor Who)">
<text>K9, occasionally written K-9, is the name of several fictional robotic canines (dogs, the name being a pun on the pronunciation of &quot;canine&quot;) in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, first appearing in 1977. K9 has also been a central character in three of the series&#x27; television spin-offs: the one-off &quot;K-9 and Company&quot; (1981), &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; (2007–2011) and &quot;K9&quot; (2009–2010). Although not originally intended to be a recurring character in the series, K9 was kept in the show following his first appearance because he was expected to be popular with younger audiences. There have been at least four separate K9 units in the series, with the first two being companions of the Fourth Doctor. Voice actor John Leeson has provided the character&#x27;s voice in most of his appearances, except during season 17 of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, in which David Brierley temporarily did so. The character was created by Bob Baker and Dave Martin, to whom rights to the character still belong; consequently, Baker&#x27;s spin-off series &quot;K9&quot;, which is not BBC-produced, could not directly reference events or characters from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, though it attempted to be a part of that continuity.

Within the series&#x27; narrative, K9 is a robot dog acquired by &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s title character (the Doctor) in the 1977 serial &quot;The Invisible Enemy&quot;. The first two incarnations of the character travelled alongside the Fourth Doctor (portrayed by Tom Baker) until 1981. In these stories, K9 proved useful for the powerful laser weapon concealed in his nose, his encyclopaedic knowledge and his vast computer intelligence. By 1981, each of the two models of K9 which travelled alongside the Doctor had been left with one of the Doctor&#x27;s female companions. The character subsequently transitioned into spin-off territory. Producers hoped K9&#x27;s popularity with children would launch the series &quot;K-9 and Company&quot;, led by actress Elisabeth Sladen in the role of companion Sarah Jane Smith alongside a new K9. In 2006, K9 reappeared in the revived series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Although the character&#x27;s appearances in the 2007 spin-off &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; were hampered by the concurrent development of the &quot;K9&quot; spin-off, the character began to appear full-time in both &quot;K9&quot; and &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, depicting adventures of the original K9 Mark I and of Mark IV, respectively.

==Televised appearances==

===K9 Mark I===
K9, retroactively &quot;K9 Mark I&quot; (Leeson), initially appeared in &quot;The Invisible Enemy&quot; (1977) as the creation of Professor Marius (Frederick Jaeger) in the year 5000. K9 subsequently travelled with the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and Leela (Louise Jameson) as a companion of the Doctor in his adventures in time and space until &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot; (1978). In this serial, K9 decides to remain on the Doctor&#x27;s home planet of Gallifrey with Leela. Immediately afterwards, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; would introduce a second incarnation of K9, played by the same prop; the last scene of &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot; shows the Doctor unpacking a box labelled &quot;K9 Mk II&quot;.

Although the first incarnation of K9 does not appear again in televised &quot;Doctor Who&quot; media, he is the star of the 2009 &quot;K9&quot; television series, in which he undergoes a sort of &quot;regeneration&quot; process from which a new, more sophisticated and futuristic K9 emerges; in the first series of &quot;K9&quot;, the character is transported to London c. 2050 by Professor Gryffen (Robert Moloney). Though on regeneration the character loses his memory of his adventures with the Doctor, he assists Gryffen and several teenage companions against a dystopian regime of &quot;The Department&quot;. The upgraded K9 has new specifications, sporting a sophisticated head-up display, the ability to fly, and more powerful laser weapons.

===K9 Mark II===
Introduced into the plot in &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;, K9 Mark II first actually appears on-screen in &quot;The Ribos Operation&quot; (1978). More mobile than his predecessor, Mark II exhibited the ability to sense and warn others of danger. He travels as a companion alongside the Doctor and Romana. Around the time of Romana&#x27;s regeneration (the transition from actress Mary Tamm to Lalla Ward), the K9 character was explained as suffering from &quot;laryngitis&quot; to accommodate Leeson&#x27;s departure from the series at the start of the 1979–80 season; for this time, he was portrayed by David Brierley, until Leeson&#x27;s return for the 1980–81 season. When the Doctor and Romana travel to the parallel universe of E-Space, K9 is severely damaged, in &quot;Warriors&#x27; Gate&quot; (1981). The damage was such that K9 could only function in E-Space; when Romana decided to stay and forge her own path, the Doctor gave K9 to her. The character makes subsequent appearances in remakes of the unfinished serial &quot;Shada&quot;, alongside the Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann); the 2003 &quot;Shada&quot; audio play and webcast depict K9 Mark II as having returned to Gallifrey with Romana, now Lady President of the Time Lords, where the Doctor visits them.

===K9 Mark III===
K9 Mark III first appeared in &quot;A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, the 1981 pilot for a series, &quot;K-9 and Company&quot;, which never materialized beyond the first episode. In this, the character is presented to the Doctor&#x27;s former companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); together, the two embark on a number of adventures. Only the first of these is depicted on-screen; several are shown in comic book and audio play adaptations, and others are alluded to by the television series. Mark III made a brief appearance alongside Sarah Jane in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 20th anniversary ninety-minute special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983), before appearing properly and for the final time in the revived series&#x27; episode &quot;School Reunion&quot; in 2006. By the time of that story, Mark III has fallen into disrepair and eventually sacrifices himself to stop a plot by the alien Krillitane and defeat their leader, Lucas Finch (Anthony Head). In the episode&#x27;s conclusion, the Doctor presents Sarah Jane with a new K9 to encourage her to continue investigating alien activity; the Doctor &quot;rebuilt&quot; him after the Mark III&#x27;s sacrifice, implying that he had the same mind and memories as his predecessor while still being a &quot;brand new model&quot;.

===K9 Mark IV===
After debuting in the final scene of &quot;School Reunion&quot; (2006), K9 Mark IV returned in spin-off series &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;&#x27; premiere episode &quot;Invasion of the Bane&quot;, where due to licensing issues with creator Bob Baker it is explained that K9 is sealing a black hole and can only communicate briefly and infrequently with Sarah Jane. The character makes a heroic appearance in the first series finale &quot;The Lost Boy&quot;, to do battle with rogue alien supercomputer Mr Smith (Alexander Armstrong), demonstrating new CGI teleportation and hovering features. K9 Mark IV&#x27;s interfaces include at least one USB port. Subsequently, the character appears briefly in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series four finale &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (2008), wherein K9 and Mr Smith assist the Doctor in returning Earth to its proper position. K9 next appears in the comedic Red Nose Day 2009 &quot;Sarah Jane&quot; mini-episode &quot;From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love&quot;. A deal with the creators of &quot;K9&quot; having been struck, K9 Mark IV became a regular character in &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; in third series story, &quot;The Mad Woman in the Attic&quot; (2009), until the series four premiere &quot;The Nightmare Man&quot; (2010), where he accompanies departing series regular, Sarah Jane&#x27;s adoptive son Luke Smith (Tommy Knight), to university. He appears again in series four finale, &quot;Goodbye, Sarah Jane Smith&quot;. Though he doesn&#x27;t appear in the serial, it is mentioned in &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; (2011) that Luke invented a special dog whistle to summon him with.

==Other appearances==

===Literature===
K9&#x27;s co-creator Dave Martin wrote a series of four children&#x27;s books entitled &quot;The Adventures of K9&quot;, published by Sparrow Books in 1980. K9 is travelling on his own in these stories for reasons not explained.

In 1985, a series of gamebooks featuring the Sixth Doctor were published by Severn House under the title &quot;Make your own adventure with Doctor Who&quot; in Britain and &quot;Find Your Fate – Doctor Who&quot; in the United States. These books were actually written by scriptwriters for the television series. Martin wrote &quot;Search for the Doctor&quot; which takes place in the mid-21st century and features Sarah&#x27;s K9 (at time of publication assumed to be Mark III, but clearly Mark IV in the light of &quot;School Reunion&quot;) being reunited with the Sixth Doctor long after Sarah&#x27;s death.

A short story, &quot;Moving On&quot;, in Virgin Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Decalog 3: Consequences&quot; anthology and the Big Finish Productions-produced &quot;Sarah Jane Smith&quot; audio play &quot;Mirror, Signal, Manoeuvre&quot; (both written by Peter Anghelides) indicate that K9 Mark III broke down and Sarah was unable to repair it as the replacement circuits would not be invented for several centuries.

Another short story, &quot;Tautology&quot;, by Glenn Langford (&quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; #194), suggests that K9 Mark III&#x27;s motherboard will be passed down through Sarah&#x27;s descendants and eventually end up in the hands of Professor Marius, who will use it to build the first K9, creating an ontological paradox.

The Virgin New Adventures seventh Doctor novel &quot;Lungbarrow&quot; (written by former Doctor TV series writer Marc Platt) featured K9s Marks I and II meeting for the first time on Gallifrey during the events surrounding the disappearance of the Doctor&#x27;s entire family house and his living relatives, which also featured many previous established Gallifreyan based characters. The two collaborated towards rescuing the Doctor, then current companion Chris Cwej and the Doctor&#x27;s lost family. This novel also served as the direct lead-in story to the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; telemovie.

&quot;Jealous, Possessive&quot; by Paul Magrs, the &quot;Scorpio&quot; story in Big Finish&#x27;s anthology &quot;Short Trips: Zodiac&quot; features K9 Mark I and Mark II relaying their exploits to each other, and their veiled put-downs to each other reveal that each considers the other to be the &quot;inferior&quot; version. This attitude is also occasionally hinted at in the way the two units refer to each other in the &quot;Gallifrey&quot; audio series.

The Eighth Doctor Adventures novel &quot;&quot; by Lawrence Miles indicates that the Doctor built a Mark IV model sometime prior to the events of that book, but what happened to this unit is not stated. In the novel &quot;The Gallifrey Chronicles&quot; by Lance Parkin, K9 Mark II makes another appearance, having been trapped within the TARDIS since the events of &quot;The Ancestor Cell&quot;. At the end of &quot;The Gallifrey Chronicles&quot; the Doctor sends K9 on a secret mission to Espero, presumably to seek out his former companion, the living TARDIS known as Compassion.

=== Movie ===
On 24 October 2015, Bob Baker and Paul Tams announced the film &quot;K9: TimeQuake&quot; which is destined for cinemas in 2017 and is to feature the robot dog facing off against classic Doctor Who villain Omega in deep space. However, this did not happen leaving it unknown when the movie will be released. In 2018 it was confirmed TimeQuake was confirmed to still be in pre-production, with plans for a prequel TV show to establish K9 for modern audiences before the movie. As of May 2024, no further updates have been made.

===Audio plays===
In the spin-off media, K9 Mark II remained Romana&#x27;s faithful companion for many years. In the early 2000s, John Leeson and Lalla Ward featured in a series of audio plays produced by BBV as K9 and &quot;The Mistress&quot;, detailing these characters&#x27; adventures in a parallel universe. As neither Romana nor E-Space could be licensed, the aliases of the Mistress and the &quot;pocket universe&quot; were used instead.

When Romana eventually returned to her own universe, she brought K9 Mark II with her (presumably having repaired it) and eventually became Lady President of Gallifrey. K9 Mark II is first seen on Gallifrey in the Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Lungbarrow&quot; by Marc Platt, alongside K9 Mark I, which had remained with Leela. Both K9 Mark I and Mark II appear, voiced by Leeson, in the Big Finish Productions audio adventure &quot;Zagreus&quot; and the &quot;Gallifrey&quot; audio series. Leela&#x27;s K9 (Mark I) was destroyed at the conclusion of the second &quot;Gallifrey&quot; series and only Mark II appears in the third series.

K9, played again by John Leeson, also featured in the Big Finish Productions series of Fourth Doctor Adventures – Mark II in Series 2 alongside Mary Tamm (Romana I), Mark I in Series 4 alongside Louise Jameson (Leela) and Mark II in Series 5 alongside Lalla Ward (Romana II)

===Online media===
In 2003, a webcast adaptation of the never-completed &quot;Shada&quot; serial was produced for the BBC&#x27;s Doctor Who website, rewritten as an Eighth Doctor adventure and featuring the post-E-Space versions of Romana II and K9 Mk II.

According to the official website for &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; in 2007, the Doctor stored several presents for Sarah inside K9, including a &quot;sonic lipstick&quot; and a watch that scans for alien life.

===Video games===
K9 appears in the &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot; video game. He is part of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Level Pack as a rideable vehicle. Archive recordings of John Leeson&#x27;s performance was used in-game as he was unavailable.

==Conceptual history==
K9 was the brainchild of writers Bob Baker and Dave Martin. Its purpose was to have a character that could narrate while the miniaturised clones of the Doctor and Leela were inside the Doctor&#x27;s body during the events of &quot;The Invisible Enemy&quot;. Martin&#x27;s own dog had also been recently run over by a car, and K9 was a car-proof tribute to it.

K9 was not originally intended to be a companion, but producer Graham Williams liked the concept so much that the decision was made to retain him as a regular character, in order to appeal to the younger members of the audience. The original name for the character was &quot;FIDO&quot; – apparently from &quot;Phenomenal Indication Data Observation&quot; unit – but it was eventually named K9.

The initial idea for realising K9 was to use a small actor inside a robotic Dobermann costume, but that was rejected in favour of a radio-controlled prop, designed by Tony Harding and made by the BBC Visual Effects Department. The Radio Control Model Centre in Harlington Middx owned by Derek Wales was commissioned to build the electronics into the first original basic shell and consequently the centre operated the dog on set for the BBC. The robot suffered from numerous technical problems during its time in the series, often malfunctioning because the radio controls interfered with the cameras and vice versa. On location, K9 also proved unable to traverse uneven terrain, and shots had to be conceived with this in mind. Workarounds included using a concealed piece of twine to pull the character along (this string can be clearly seen in a shot of K9 on Brighton Beach), or laying wooden planks on which it could roll.
K9&#x27;s innards were redesigned twice more over the course of the series, firstly in collaboration with a company called Slough Radio Control. It allowed one of its employees, Nigel Brackley, to be seconded to the series semi-permanently to supervise the prop. Brackley, who went on to a career in the movie industry, controlled K9 for many of its studio appearances. Eventually, there came a point where the dog&#x27;s inherent liabilities were outweighing his assets, and the internal mechanisms were completely rebuilt by designer Charlie Lumm. The wheels were enlarged and given independent drives for power and better manoeuvrability, and the radio controls were switched from AM to FM signals to resist interference. However, by the time the improved model made his debut in &quot;State of Decay&quot;, the first story recorded for Season 18, the decision had already been made to write the character out of the series in the adventure &quot;Warriors&#x27; Gate&quot;.

K9 was a popular enough character to warrant an attempt to spin him off into his own series. In addition to K9 dolls, there were also talking K9 toys produced by Palitoy, the speech provided by a miniature record inside the body of the toy. John Leeson provided the voice for K9 in all its appearances, except for Season 17 (which included the unfinished &quot;Shada&quot;) when it was voiced by David Brierley. When &quot;Shada&quot; was remade by Big Finish Productions, Leeson provided its voice.

The practical challenges of working with the K9 prop continued on his return to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2006. Producer Russell T Davies told &quot;SFX&quot; magazine, &quot;Yes, just as we expected, multiple takes when he bumped into a door or veered off to the left. Lis Sladen did warn us, and she was right!&quot; Two different incarnations of K9 appeared regularly in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-offs from 2009: Mark IV in the third series of BBC production &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, and a re-vamped Mark I in the Jetix Europe production &quot;K9&quot;.

==&quot;K9&quot; (2010 spin-off series)==
A proposed K9 television series or special had been rumoured since the late 1990s, and images of a redesigned K9 were leaked. However, nothing came of this effort until 2006.

On 24 April 2006, &quot;The Independent&quot;, the &quot;Daily Star&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; confirmed, following previous rumours, that K9 would be featured in a 26-part children&#x27;s series, &quot;K9&quot;, to be written by Bob Baker. The article in &quot;The Times&quot; also featured a picture of the redesigned K9 for the animated series. The series will be a blend of live-action and a CGI K9.

Each episode was 30 minutes long, made by Jetix Europe and London-based distribution outfit Park Entertainment. According to a report in &quot;Broadcast&quot; magazine, the BBC opted out of involvement in order to focus on their own &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off, &quot;Torchwood&quot;, meaning that BBC-owned characters did not appear in the series.

On 3 April 2010, the TV series K9 began broadcasting on the Australian Television Network Ten as part of a Saturday morning line-up of children&#x27;s shows. John Leeson was the voice of K9. The first episode, called &quot;Regeneration&quot;, featured the earlier Mark I version of K9. The &quot;older&quot; K9 materialized in London in the future and in the midst of an incident where an alien species is threatening human lives. K9 sacrificed himself in order to save the humans, but one component survived that enabled his self-regeneration into the new unit. The main human cast members include Robert Moloney as Professor Gryffen, Keegan Joyce as Starkey (K9&#x27;s new &quot;master&quot;), and Daniel Webber as Darius. The first 14 episodes of &quot;K9&quot; season 1 were broadcast mid-morning on Channel 5 in December 2010 with the remaining episodes scheduled for January 2011. Trailers for the series appeared on Channel 5 from early December voiced by John Leeson. Originally, it had been planned to split the series in two-halves between the Christmas 2010 and Easter 2011 school holiday schedules.

==Cultural influence==
In 1990, an unspecified K9 unit appeared with Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor and Sophie Aldred as Ace in an episode of the children&#x27;s education programme &quot;Search Out Science&quot; entitled &quot;Search Out Space&quot;, which was included as an extra on the release of the Doctor Who story &quot;Survival&quot; by the BBC. Another unspecified K9 unit also appeared in the 1993 charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;. In the 1998 computer game &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, the Navarro base has a damaged robot dog known as K9, which uses similar speech mannerisms to the Infobox Doctor Who character. If repaired, the cyberdog is willing to join the character&#x27;s party as a companion. In the 1999 television series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; (written by future &quot;Doctor Who&quot; executive producer Russell T Davies), a K9 model is given to the character Vince as a birthday present. The prop used was an original, operated – as occasionally in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; – by visual effects assistant Mat Irvine. In the second series of &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; (2002), the character of Alan Partridge recalls how his purchase of the rights to K9 contributed to his mental breakdown and driving to Dundee in his bare feet while gorging on Toblerone. In the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Go God Go XII&quot; (2006), Eric Cartman, being trapped in the year 2546, has acquired a robot dog called &quot;K-10&quot;, a parody of K9. Due to timeline alterations, he is replaced by robot cat &quot;Kit-9&quot; and later robot bird, &quot;Cocka-3&quot;. K9 appeared on a special &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-themed edition of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; in 2007, but was voted out unanimously at the end of the first round, despite answering his question correctly. This was due to the fact every single player of the team answered correctly and banked the £5,000 target, and that the producers told the contestants to vote him off, just in case he broke down. Anne Robinson (whom K9 addressed as &quot;Mistress&quot;) said &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry&quot; before declaring him the weakest link.

In the final area of the game &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot;, the main character&#x27;s dog appears similar to K9 and can fire lasers from its mouth.

Engineers at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center have dubbed two intelligent mobile robots designed to explore the surface of Mars &quot;K-9&quot; and &quot;Gromit&quot;. NASA&#x27;s K-9 is named after both &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s K-9 and Marvin the Martian&#x27;s pet dog, K-9.

Several individuals have built their own personal K9 robots, ranging from radio controlled units like that used on the show to several levels of computerised autonomy.

K-9 Mail is a popular e-mail client for the Android operating system, with the name and the logo being a direct reference to the K9 robot.

On November 3, 2020, American newspaper the New York Times used three different coloured K9s circling a ballot box as an animated graphic logo for their coverage of the social media and the 2020 US Presidential Election.

<text>John Quidor (January 26, 1801 – December 13, 1881) was an American painter of historical and literary subjects. He has about 35 known canvases, most of which are based on Washington Irving&#x27;s stories about Dutch New York, drawing inspiration from the Hudson Valley and from such English painters as William Hogarth, Isaac Cruikshank, James Gillray, Joseph Wright of Derby, and George Morland.

==Biography==
John Quidor was born in 1801 in Tappan, New York. His family moved to New York City in 1810. In 1818, at the age 17, he began an apprenticeship with John Wesley Jarvis (where artist Henry Inman was also training), which was the only artistic training he received. The apprenticeship was not a success. Quidor felt that Jarvis did not pay sufficient attention to him, favoring Inman over him, leading Quidor in 1822 to sue Jarvis for breach of indenture, winning damages of $251.35 ($6,244.97 in 2022 dollars). Because he had to admit that he had received inadequate training, the lawsuit damaged his reputation more than Jarvis&#x27;.

Following his apprenticeship, Quidor earned a living by painting banners and doing decorative work on steamboats and fire engines for New York&#x27;s fire companies. 

None of his decorative work is known to have survived. Starting in 1823, he began creating paintings based on literary themes, including, his first two efforts, &quot;Dorothea&quot; and &quot;Don Quixote Imagines Melisendra’s Rescue by a Moor&quot;, both paintings based on the Miguel de Cervantes novel, Don Quixote; then following with Washington Irving&#x27;s short stories &quot;Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; and &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; and James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s book &quot;The Pioneers&quot;. During this part of his career, he took on Thomas Bangs Thorpe and Charles Loring Elliott as his apprentices. Of his time working for Quidor, Thorpe recalled that &quot;in all the time we were with Quidor, many months, I do not remember of his giving us anything but easel room and one or two very common engravings to copy. He would absent himself from his studio for days and weeks together. When present, if not painting on a banner or engine back, he would generally lie at full length on the long bench.&quot;

A fire destroyed Quidor&#x27;s studio, located at 46 Canal Street, on December 16, 1835. That incident, combined with two major cholera outbreaks in the area and a financial crash in the late 1830s, led Quidor to abandon New York. He moved to Quincy, Illinois, in 1837, and, in 1844, purchased an $8,000 ($299,891.20 in 2022 dollars) farm, which he paid for by painting eight large religious canvases based on engravings of works by Benjamin West. These canvases were exhibited in New York in 1847, but their whereabouts and status are currently unknown.

In 1851 Quidor returned to New York where he stayed until his retirement in 1869. During this period, his style changed. He simplified his compositions and used a narrower range of colors, which he thinned with varnish so that his stylized, nervously rendered figures nearly disappeared into hazy backgrounds. He apparently stopped painting in 1868. He lived in Jersey City, New Jersey, where his eldest daughter lived, from 1869 until his death in 1881.

==Career==
Little appreciated in his time, Quidor was rediscovered as an important figure in American art after a 1942 exhibition of his works at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.

His paintings establish a mysterious romantic setting for scenes in which he mingled macabre elements with an earthy humor. Many of his works, such as &quot;The Headless Horseman Pursuing Ichabod Crane&quot;, in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, were inspired by the writings of Washington Irving. Irving&#x27;s &quot;A History of New York&quot; gave Quidor the subjects for the four paintings in the Brooklyn Museum of Art: &quot;Dancing on the Battery&quot; (c. 1860), &quot;Peter Stuyvesant&#x27;s Wall Street Gate&quot; (1864), &quot;Voyage of the Good Oloff up the Hudson&quot; (1866), and &quot;The Voyage from Communipaw to Hell Gate&quot; (1866). These show Quidor&#x27;s characteristic mellow and harmonious color, poetic imagination, and naïve humor.

Also in the Brooklyn Museum of Art are his three paintings &quot;Dorothea&quot;, &quot;Money Diggers&quot;, and &quot;Wolfert&#x27;s Will&quot;. He sometimes painted religious subjects, such as &quot;Jesus Blessing the Sick&quot;.

<doc id="1228638" wikidata="Q899127" url="?curid=1228638" title="Chemical shift">
<text>In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the chemical shift is the resonant frequency of an atomic nucleus relative to a standard in a magnetic field. Often the position and number of chemical shifts are diagnostic of the structure of a molecule. Chemical shifts are also used to describe signals in other forms of spectroscopy such as photoemission spectroscopy.

Some atomic nuclei possess a magnetic moment (nuclear spin), which gives rise to different energy levels and resonance frequencies in a magnetic field. The total magnetic field experienced by a nucleus includes local magnetic fields induced by currents of electrons in the molecular orbitals (electrons have a magnetic moment themselves). The electron distribution of the same type of nucleus (e.g. ) usually varies according to the local geometry (binding partners, bond lengths, angles between bonds, and so on), and with it the local magnetic field at each nucleus. This is reflected in the spin energy levels (and resonance frequencies). The variations of nuclear magnetic resonance frequencies of the same kind of nucleus, due to variations in the electron distribution, is called the chemical shift. The size of the chemical shift is given with respect to a reference frequency or reference sample (see also chemical shift referencing), usually a molecule with a barely distorted electron distribution.

==Operating frequency==
The operating (or Larmor) frequency formula_1 of a magnet (usually quoted as absolute value in MHz) is calculated from the Larmor equation

: formula_2

where is the induction of the magnet (SI units of tesla), and formula_3 is the magnetogyric ratio of the nucleus an empirically measured fundamental constant determined by the details of the structure of each nucleus. For example, the proton operating frequency for a 1-tesla magnet is calculated as

: formula_4

MRI scanners are often referred to by their field strengths (e.g. &quot;a 7 T scanner&quot;), whereas NMR spectrometers are commonly referred to by the corresponding proton Larmor frequency (e.g. &quot;a 300 MHz spectrometer&quot;, which has a of 7 T). While chemical shift is referenced in order that the units are equivalent across different field strengths, the actual frequency separation in hertz scales with field strength (). As a result, the difference of chemical shift between two signals (ppm) represents a larger number of hertz on machines that have larger , and therefore the signals are less likely to be overlapping in the resulting spectrum. This increased resolution is a significant advantage for analysis. (Larger-field machines are also favoured on account of having intrinsically higher signal arising from the Boltzmann distribution of magnetic spin states.)

==Chemical shift referencing==
Chemical shift is usually expressed in parts per million (ppm) by frequency, because it is calculated from

: formula_5

where is the absolute resonance frequency of the sample, and is the absolute resonance frequency of a standard reference compound, measured in the same applied magnetic field . Since the numerator is usually expressed in hertz, and the denominator in megahertz, is expressed in ppm.

The detected frequencies (in Hz) for 1H, 13C, and 29Si nuclei are usually referenced against TMS (tetramethylsilane), TSP (trimethylsilylpropanoic acid), or DSS, which by the definition above have a chemical shift of zero if chosen as the reference. Other standard materials are used for setting the chemical shift for other nuclei.

Thus an NMR signal observed at a frequency 300 Hz higher than the signal from TMS, where the TMS resonance frequency is 300 MHz, has a chemical shift of

: formula_6

Although the absolute resonance frequency depends on the applied magnetic field, the chemical shift is independent of external magnetic field strength. On the other hand, the resolution of NMR will increase with applied magnetic field.

=== Referencing methods ===
Practically speaking, diverse methods may be used to reference chemical shifts in an NMR experiment, which can be subdivided into &quot;indirect&quot; and &quot;direct&quot; referencing methods. Indirect referencing uses a channel other than the one of interest to adjust chemical shift scale correctly, i.e. the solvent signal in the deuterium (lock) channel can be used to reference the a 1H NMR spectrum. Both indirect and direct referencing can be done as three different procedures:
# Internal referencing, where the reference compound is added directly to the system under study.&quot; In this common practice, users adjust residual solvent signals of 1H or 13C NMR spectra with calibrated spectral tables. If substances other than the solvent itself are used for internal referencing, the sample has to be combined with the reference compound, which may affect the chemical shifts.
# External referencing, involving sample and reference contained separately in coaxial cylindrical tubes. With this procedure, the reference signal is still visible in the spectrum of interest, although the reference and the sample are physically separated by a glass wall. Magnetic susceptibility differences between the sample and the reference phase need to be corrected theoretically, which lowers the practicality of this procedure.
# Substitution method: The use of separate cylindrical tubes for the sample and the reference compound, with (in principle) spectra recorded individually for each. Similar to external referencing, this method allows referencing without sample contamination. If field/frequency locking via the 2H signal of the deuterated solvent is used and the solvents of reference and analyte are the same, the use of this methods is straightforward. Problems may arise if different solvents are used for the reference compound and the sample as (just like for external referencing) magnetic susceptibility differences need to be corrected theoretically. If this method is used without field/frequency locking, shimming procedures between the sample and the reference need to be avoided as they change the applied magnetic field (and thereby influence the chemical shift).

Modern NMR spectrometers commonly make use of the absolute scale, which defines the 1H signal of TMS as 0 ppm in proton NMR and the center frequencies of all other nuclei as percentage of the TMS resonance frequency:

: formula_7

The use of the deuterium (lock) channel, so the 2H signal of the deuterated solvent, and the Ξ value of the absolute scale is a form of internal referencing and is particularly useful in heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy as local reference compounds may not be always be available or easily used (i.e. liquid NH3 for 15N NMR spectroscopy). This system, however, relies on accurately determined 2H NMR chemical shifts enlisted in the spectrometer software and correctly determined Ξ values by IUPAC. A recent study for 19F NMR spectroscopy revealed that the use of the absolute scale and lock-based internal referencing led to errors in chemical shifts. These may be negated by inclusion of calibrated reference compounds.

==The induced magnetic field==
The electrons around a nucleus will circulate in a magnetic field and create a secondary induced magnetic field. This field opposes the applied field as stipulated by Lenz&#x27;s law and atoms with higher induced fields (i.e., higher electron density) are therefore called &quot;shielded&quot;, relative to those with lower electron density. Electron-donating alkyl groups, for example, lead to increased shielding whereas electron-withdrawing substituents such as nitro groups lead to &quot;deshielding&quot; of the nucleus. Not only substituents cause local induced fields. Bonding electrons can also lead to shielding and deshielding effects. A striking example of this is the pi bonds in benzene. Circular current through the hyperconjugated system causes a shielding effect at the molecule&#x27;s center and a deshielding effect at its edges. Trends in chemical shift are explained based on the degree of shielding or deshielding.

Nuclei are found to resonate in a wide range to the left (or more rare to the right) of the internal standard. When a signal is found with a higher chemical shift:
* The applied effective magnetic field is lower, if the resonance frequency is fixed (as in old traditional CW spectrometers)
* The frequency is higher, when the applied magnetic field is static (normal case in FT spectrometers)
* The nucleus is more deshielded
* The signal or shift is downfield or at low field or paramagnetic.

Conversely a lower chemical shift is called a diamagnetic shift, and is upfield and more shielded.

==Diamagnetic shielding==
In real molecules protons are surrounded by a cloud of charge due to adjacent bonds and atoms. In an applied magnetic field () electrons circulate and produce an induced field () which opposes the applied field. The effective field at the nucleus will be . The nucleus is said to be experiencing a diamagnetic shielding.

==Factors causing chemical shifts==
Important factors influencing chemical shift are electron density, electronegativity of neighboring groups and anisotropic induced magnetic field effects.

Electron density shields a nucleus from the external field. For example, in proton NMR the electron-poor tropylium ion has its protons downfield at 9.17 ppm, those of the electron-rich cyclooctatetraenyl anion move upfield to 6.75 ppm and its dianion even more upfield to 5.56 ppm.

A nucleus in the vicinity of an electronegative atom experiences reduced electron density and the nucleus is therefore deshielded. In proton NMR of methyl halides (CH3X) the chemical shift of the methyl protons increase in the order from 2.16 ppm to 4.26 ppm reflecting this trend. In carbon NMR the chemical shift of the carbon nuclei increase in the same order from around −10 ppm to 70 ppm. Also when the electronegative atom is removed further away the effect diminishes until it can be observed no longer.

Anisotropic induced magnetic field effects are the result of a local induced magnetic field experienced by a nucleus resulting from circulating electrons that can either be paramagnetic when it is parallel to the applied field or diamagnetic when it is opposed to it. It is observed in alkenes where the double bond is oriented perpendicular to the external field with pi electrons likewise circulating at right angles. The induced magnetic field lines are parallel to the external field at the location of the alkene protons which therefore shift downfield to a 4.5 ppm to 7.5 ppm range. The three-dimensional space where a diamagnetic shift is called the shielding zone with a cone-like shape aligned with the external field.

The protons in aromatic compounds are shifted downfield even further with a signal for benzene at 7.73 ppm as a consequence of a diamagnetic ring current.

Alkyne protons by contrast resonate at high field in a 2–3 ppm range. For alkynes the most effective orientation is the external field in parallel with electrons circulation around the triple bond. In this way the acetylenic protons are located in the cone-shaped shielding zone hence the upfield shift.

==Magnetic properties of most common nuclei==
1H and 13C are not the only nuclei susceptible to NMR experiments. A number of different nuclei can also be detected, although the use of such techniques is generally rare due to small relative sensitivities in NMR experiments (compared to 1H) of the nuclei in question, the other factor for rare use being their slender representation in nature and organic compounds.
1H, 13C, 15N, 19F and 31P are the five nuclei that have the greatest importance in NMR experiments:
* 1H because of high sensitivity and vast occurrence in organic compounds
* 13C because of being the key component of all organic compounds despite occurring at a low abundance (1.1%) compared to the major isotope of carbon 12C, which has a spin of 0 and therefore is NMR-inactive.
* 15N because of being a key component of important biomolecules such as proteins and DNA
* 19F because of high relative sensitivity
* 31P because of frequent occurrence in organic compounds and moderate relative sensitivity

==Chemical shift manipulation==
In general, the associated increased signal-to-noise and resolution has driven a move towards increasingly high field strengths. In limited cases, however, lower fields are preferred; examples are for systems in chemical exchange, where the speed of the exchange relative to the NMR experiment can cause additional and confounding linewidth broadening. Similarly, while avoidance of second order coupling is generally preferred, this information can be useful for elucidation of chemical structures. Using refocussing pulses placed between recording of successive points of the free induction decay, in an analogous fashion to the spin echo technique in MRI, the chemical shift evolution can be scaled to provide apparent low-field spectra on a high-field spectrometer. In a similar fashion, it is possible to upscale the effect of J-coupling relative to the chemical shift using pulse sequences that include additional J-coupling evolution periods interspersed with conventional spin evolutions.

==Other chemical shifts==
The Knight shift (first reported in 1949) and Shoolery&#x27;s rule are observed with pure metals and methylene groups, respectively. The NMR chemical shift in its present-day meaning first appeared in journals in 1950. Chemical shifts with a different meaning appear in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as the shift in atomic core-level energy due to a specific chemical environment. The term is also used in Mössbauer spectroscopy, where similarly to NMR it refers to a shift in peak position due to the local chemical bonding environment. As is the case for NMR the chemical shift reflects the electron density at the atomic nucleus.

<doc id="1228640" wikidata="Q6900750" url="?curid=1228640" title="Monkey Island, Bray">
<text>Monkey Island is an island in the River Thames in England, on the reach above Boveney Lock. Its nearest village is Bray, Berkshire. The dominant building on the island is a small hotel since the late 19th century. The reach on which it sits is a main reach in boat hiring and tour boating, between Windsor and Maidenhead. The island and the reach have been a tour destination since the Georgian era – particularly so after its purchase by the Duke of Marlborough of 1738 (of the current Dukedom well-noted for Blenheim Palace) who in nameplay put colourful statues of monkeys in his various gardens for visitors to discover. In one of his two small buildings on the island (by Palladian architect Robert Morris) some of these remain.

== Origins ==

Monkey is simple Old English: &quot;Monks Ey(ot)&quot;, Monks&#x27; Island. It was probably a source of fishing revenues and may have been regularly visited by monks living and working at Amerden Bank, a moated site near Bray Lock on the Buckinghamshire bank of the river, as part of the Merton Priory from 1197 and a later house until the dissolution of the monasteries. By the 14th century, it had passed to the Canonesses of Burnham Abbey (a mile to the north). In the Bray Court Rolls of 1361, the island is written &quot;Bournhames Eyte&quot;. Many islands in the Thames below the Wiltshire/Gloucestershire border had a religious aspect. The name recurs in the P.R.O. plan of 1640 as &quot;Burnham-Ayt&quot;.

The island passed to the Englefield family in 1606. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, Oxfordshire stone and bricks were shipped in barges for rebuilding of the City. On their return, the barges carried rubble to be spread about certain of the Thames islands. The rubble reduces erosion and greatly built up the land.

== The Duke&#x27;s Island ==

In 1738, Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough acquired the island from Sir Francis Englefield. Spencer had seen the property while attending the Kit-Kat Club at nearby Down Place. The Duke was a well-known angler, and it was he who erected the first two buildings on the island to indulge his hobby. The fishing lodge and the fishing temple, as they were then described, remain as &quot;the Pavilion&quot; and &quot;the Temple&quot;, respectively.

Palladian architect Robert Morris was enlisted to design and build both buildings at a cost of £8,756. The ninth Earl of Pembroke was also involved in the design of the Temple; the Duke paid him £2,277 for his work from 1745 to 1748.

;The Fishing Lodge (Pavilion)
The Pavilion is, greatly, built out of coloured wood blocks cut (&quot;cut ashlar&quot;) to look like stone, a specialty of Georgian carpentry. Inside the Duke&#x27;s commissioned Singerie paintings, creating its &quot;Monkey Room&quot;. Spencer commissioned the French artist Andieu de Clermont to paint them – playing cards, shooting, fishing, smoking – and it is known they were completed before 1738. Other works of the artist were for Langley Hall, Norfolk.

The Duke&#x27;s curious décor later led some to call the island &quot;Marlborough’s Folly&quot;. Indeed, Lady Hertford described the Pavilion soon after it was finished with both a hint of admiration and amazement:
The parlour, which is the only room in it except the kitchen, is painted upon the ceiling in grotesque, with monkeys fishing, shooting etc., and its sides are hung with paper. When a person sits in this room he cannot see the water though the island is not above a stone&#x27;s cast over: nor is he prevented from this by shade: for, except for six or eight walnut trees and a few orange trees in tubs there is not a leaf upon the island; it arises entirely from the river running very much below its banks.
;The Fishing Temple (Temple)
The Temple, 100 yards away, was originally open on the ground floor like a market stall. The Duke&#x27;s fine and eclectic decorative taste is again evident in the first-floor room that was once a billiard room. Its grand ceiling – with Neptune, shells and mermaids in high relief plasterwork of Wedgwood style – is said to be the work of Roberts of Oxford circa 1725, though some accounts attribute it to carver William Perritt.

The Duke of Marlborough died in 1758. The island was bought in 1787 by Henry Townley Ward, who left it to P.C. Bruce, also , of Taplow.

== Inn to hotel ==

By 1840, the Pavilion had become a riverside inn reached by ferry from the west. By the mid-late 19th century the hotel was called the &quot;Monkey Hall Hotel&quot;. Visitors have been staying in various parts of the two buildings ever since. It became particularly fashionable just after 1900, when Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark often had afternoon tea on the lawns with their children. Edward Elgar composed his &quot;violin concerto&quot; in 1910 in the Hut, a house on the riverbank facing Monkey Island. Musical stars Clara Butt and Nellie Melba entertained the island&#x27;s guests. From 1912, Rebecca West and H. G. Wells frequented the island and it was here that West set her first novel, &quot;Return of the Soldier&quot;, whose heroine was the innkeeper&#x27;s daughter.

The middle of the twentieth century saw extensive additions to and refurbishment of the island. In 1956, the footbridge that connects it to shore was added after Christopher Reynolds purchased the island. In 1963, the Pavilion&#x27;s dining area was expanded by the addition of the River Room, a large, glass-walled building that hangs just over the Thames. Named in homage to the Duke, the Marlborough Room was added in 1970 at the upstream end of the building, whose walls were painted with battle scenes. In the same year, the Temple was extended to provide a further 30 bedrooms. The Pavilion and Temple are both Grade I listed buildings.

As proprietor from 1956 to 1971, Mr Reynolds brought renewed vigour to the island with his thoughtful additions. Monkey Island also enjoyed continued popularity: in 1964 it played host to a ball in aid of Oxfam, which&quot; Tatler &quot;covered under the headline &quot;Oxfam-On-Thames&quot;.

In 1967, Mr Reynolds produced Monkey Island&#x27;s own journal, &quot;The Islander.&quot; The first issue told of the popularity of the island&#x27;s Club Suppers, Island Luncheon Club for Ladies, and entertainment provided by Jimmy Fraser and Mike Allen.
The hotel was purchased by Major Fitzwilliams and later sold to the Weinreb Group, which subsequently went into receivership.

In 1976, Paul and Liz Nichols purchased Monkey Island Hotel from the Liquidators and carried out extensive renovations during their 9-year tenure. The hotel achieved recommendations from the &quot;Michelin Guide&quot; and Egon Ronay and was a British Tourist Authority Country Hotel and Restaurant Award winner in 1983,1984, and 1985.
In 1986, the hotel was sold to Basil Faidi, who further restored the Grade I listed buildings.

The hotel was sold some 10 years later to the Habtour Group and was then acquired by Dr Andreas C. Papadakis in September 2007.

In 2015 Monkey Island was acquired by YTL Hotels and renamed to Monkey Island Estate. Following YTL Hotels&#x27; renovation, the new hotel reopened in April 2019.

==Cultural references==
In Chapter 94 of Charlie Higson&#x27;s young adult horror novel, &quot;The Fallen&quot; (2013 UK, 2014 US), Ella, Maeve, Monkey Boy, and Robbie leave the Natural History Museum to stay in the country, and running out of petrol, settle in at the Monkey Island Hotel. In the book&#x27;s final chapter (Chapter 96), the haven has become a house of horror.

The island also features in Rebecca West&#x27;s early novel The Return of the Soldier.

<doc id="1228646" wikidata="Q1283774" url="?curid=1228646" title="Calcium release activated channel">
<text>Calcium release-activated channels (CRAC) are specialized plasma membrane Ca2+ ion channels. When calcium ions (Ca2+) are depleted from the endoplasmic reticulum (a major store of Ca2+) of mammalian cells, the CRAC channel is activated to slowly replenish the level of calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum. The Ca2+ Release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) Channel (CRAC-C) Family (TC# 1.A.52) is a member of the Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) Superfamily. These proteins typically have between 4 and 6 transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). The 4 TMS CRAC channels arose by loss of 2TMSs from 6TMS CDF carriers, an example of &#x27;reverse&#x27; evolution&#x27;.

== Homology ==
There are several proteins that belong to the CRAC-C family. A list of the currently classified members of the CRAC-C family can be found in the Transporter Classification Database. This classification is based on sequence similarity which also happens to coincide with functional and structural similarities between homologues.

== Structure ==
Almost all CRAC homologues are about 250 residues long, but some are up to 100 residues longer (e.g., the &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; Olf186-F, TC# 1.A.52.1.5).

The plasma membrane protein &quot;Orai&quot; (ORAI1 and ORAI2 in humans) forms the pore of the CRAC channel. The protein ORAI1 is a structural component of the CRAC calcium channel. ORAI1 interacts with the STIM1 protein. STIM1 is a transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). STIM1 can sense the concentration of Ca2+ inside the ER. When the concentration of Ca2+ inside the ER becomes low, STIM1 proteins aggregate and interact with ORAI1 located in the cell surface membrane. When the concentration of Ca2+ inside the ER approaches an upper set point, another protein, SARAF (TMEM66) associates with STIM1 to inactivate the store-operated calcium channel (SOCE).

The crystal structure of Orai from &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; has been determined at 3.35 angstrom resolution (). The calcium channel is composed of a hexameric assembly of Orai subunits arranged around a central ion pore. The pore traverses the membrane and extends into the cytosol. A ring of glutamate residues on its extracellular side forms the selectivity filter. A basic region near the intracellular side can bind anions that may stabilize the closed state. The architecture of the channel differs markedly from other ion channels and provides insight into the principles of selective calcium permeation and gating.

== Function ==
In electrically non-excitable cells (i.e., blood cells), Ca2+ influx is essential for regulating a host of kinetically distinct processes involving exocytosis, enzyme control, gene regulation, cell growth and proliferation, and apoptosis. Capacitative calcium entry appears to also be a major means of signal transduction. The major Ca2+ entry pathway in these cells is the store-operated one, in which the emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores activates Ca2+ influx (store-operated Ca2+ entry, or capacitative Ca2+ entry). This is often referred to as the store-operated current or SOC.

A common mechanism by which such cytoplasmic calcium signals are generated involves receptors that are coupled to the activation of phospholipase C. Phospholipase C generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which in turn mediates the discharge of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (components of the endoplasmic reticulum), allowing calcium to be released into the cytosol. In most of the cell, the fall in Ca2+ concentration within the lumen of the Ca2+-storing organelles subsequently activates plasma membrane Ca2+ channels.

=== STIM Complex ===
STIM1 is a Ca2+-sensor protein specialized for electrical signaling in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts with and mediates store-dependent regulation of both Orai1 and TRPC1 channels. TRPC1+STIM1-dependent SOC requires functional Orai1. STIM1 is the mechanistic &#x27;missing link&#x27; between the ER and the plasma membrane. STIM proteins sense the depletion of luminal Ca2+ from the ER and trigger activation of CRAC channels in the surface membrane after Ca2+ store depletion. The process involves oligomerization, then translocation to junctions adjacent to the plasma membrane, by which the CRAC channels become organized into clusters and then open to bring about SOC entry.

=== Lymphocytes ===
The primary mechanism of extracellular Ca2+ entry in lymphocytes involves CRAC channels. STIM1 is a crucial component of the CRAC influx mechanism in lymphocytes, acting as a sensor of low Ca2+ concentration in the ER and an activator of the Ca2+ selective channel ORAI1 in the plasma membrane. Yarkoni and Cambier (2011) reported that STIM1 expression differs in murine T and B lymphocytes; mature T cells express about 4 times more STIM1 than mature B cells. Through the physiologic range of expression, STIM1 levels determine the magnitude of Ca2+ influx responses that follow BCR-induced intracellular store depletion.

=== SCID ===
Antigen stimulation of immune cells triggers Ca2+ entry through tetrameric Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, promoting the immune response to pathogens by activating the transcription factor NFAT. Cells from patients with one form of hereditary Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) syndrome are defective in store-operated Ca2+ entry and CRAC channel function. The genetic defect in these patients appears to be in ORAI1 (TM protein 142A; TMEM142a), which contains four putative transmembrane segments. SCID patients are homozygous for a single missense mutation in ORAI1, and expression of wild-type ORAI1 in SCID T cells restores store-operated Ca2+ influx and the CRAC current (ICRAC).

=== SOCE ===
Store operated calcium entry (SOCE) is used to regulate basal calcium, refill intracellular Ca2+ stores, and execute a wide range of specialized activities. STIM and Orai are the essential components enabling the reconstitution of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels that mediate SOCE. Palty et al. (2012) reported the molecular identification of SARAF as a negative regulator of SOCE. It is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane resident protein that associates with STIM to facilitate slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation of SOCE. SARAF plays a key role in shaping cytosolic Ca2+ signals and determining the content of the major intracellular Ca2+ stores, a role that is likely to be important in protecting cells from Ca2+overfilling.

<doc id="1228658" wikidata="Q460356" url="?curid=1228658" title="Ear piercing instrument">
<text>An ear-piercing instrument (commonly referred to as a piercing gun or an ear-piercing gun) is a device designed to pierce earlobes by driving a pointed starter stud through the lobe. Piercing guns are typically used for ear piercing in mall jewelry shops, beauty salons, pharmacies, and doctors&#x27; offices.

Piercing guns have been widely criticized as dangerous among professional body piercers. The use of older designs of piercing gun can possibly carry an increased risk of disease transmission, as compared to methods used by professional piercers. Piercing guns have been criticised for causing damage (sometimes mischaracterised as blunt-force trauma) to the skin and underlying tissue. Diminished air and blood circulation in tissue compressed by a piercing gun can lead to prolonged healing, minor complications and scarring.

More modern designs of reusable ear-piercing instruments, such as Inverness and Studex System 75, use self-contained, single-use, sealed, and sterilised disposable cartridges or cassettes. The studs used with such systems often have thinner posts (normally 20 gauge) with sharper tips, as opposed to the thicker (16 gauge), blunter posts of the &quot;standard&quot; ear-piercing guns. This makes the piercing somewhat less painful, and lessens trauma to the skin and tissue, but may still cause more trauma compared to hollow needles used by professional body piercers. Modern ear-piercing studs are also more likely to be made from materials certified as safe for long-term implant in the human body, such as titanium.

==Design and use==
===Traditional model===
The older designs of ear-piercing gun, which came widely into use in the 1970s but are still in widespread use (e.g., &quot;Studex Universal&quot;) employ a spring that stores potential energy when the instrument is &quot;cocked&quot; ready for piercing by pulling back a plunger.

The starter studs and friction clasps that are used with these instruments typically come in pairs, in sealed, sterilized packages. The studs have a pointed tip designed to pierce the earlobe rapidly when the trigger mechanism is released, and a &quot;shoulder&quot; to hold the clasp in place, and to maintain appropriate spacing between the clasp and the stud head, such that the earlobe is not squeezed while healing. The studs are slightly thicker, 16-gauge, and are made of surgical steel, 24 karat gold-plated steel, 14-karat gold, or titanium.

To conduct the ear piercing, the instrument is first cocked by drawing the plunger back. The piercer inserts the head of one of the pair of starter studs selected by the client into an adapter in the barrel in the body of the instrument, and the clasp is slid into the clasp retainer at the front of the instrument. The piercer then positions the client&#x27;s earlobe between the point of the stud and the clasp retainer, and squeezes the instrument closed such that the tip of the stud is aligned with the mark where the piercing is to be placed, and to hold the earlobe in place during the piercing. When the alignment of the stud is correct, the piercer releases the trigger, and the force of the spring causes the instrument to fire with considerable pressure, snapping the plunger forward, pushing the point of the stud rapidly through the earlobe, and engaging it with the clasp behind the earlobe, completing the ear piercing. As necessary, the procedure is repeated to pierce the other ear.

The older designs of ear-piercing gun cannot easily be sterilized, which led to the development of more modern systems that employ single-use, disposable cartridges.

===Disposable-cartridge designs===

Most newer models of piercing guns use a disposable cartridge, sometimes called a &quot;cassette&quot;. With these models, the stud holder and clasp holder are fully disposable. In some parts of the world, this modification is either specifically required (e.g., in Scotland) or implied by Health and Safety legislation.

===Hand-pressure designs===
In certain more modern designs, such as Inverness 2000 and Studex System 75, the instrument operates via hand pressure, whereby the piercer squeezes the instrument closed to push the stud rapidly through the ear, instead of via the force of a spring when a trigger is released. These models work with piercing studs housed in disposable, single-use cassettes, which are loaded into the instrument without the operator touching either the studs or the clasps; sufficient force to pierce the ear rapidly is attained when the stud breaks apart its plastic mount inside the cassette. The ease of operation, the greater variety of stud designs (different materials, jewels, settings, and shapes), and the relative painlessness of the piercing, and the absence of a sudden &quot;snap&quot; facilitated by such instruments is likely to have contributed to the widespread increase in popularity in ear piercing since the late 20th century, and in trends such as multiple piercing, piercing among both sexes and in younger children, and the abandonment of the perception of ear piercing as an ordeal.

Another design for a hand-pressure ear-piercing instrument is Coren, which comprises a small U-shaped plastic holder pre-loaded with a standard 16-gauge ear-piercing stud in one arm of the device and the clasp in the other. To pierce the ear, the operator closes the instrument around the earlobe, aligning the point of the stud with the mark for the desired placement of the piercing, and squeezes a plastic plunger with sufficient pressure to break two plastic flanges on either side of the plunger, forcing the stud rapidly through the earlobe, and engaging the stud with the clasp behind the earlobe. The used instrument is then discarded.

==Criticism==
Ear-piercing &quot;guns&quot; have been widely criticized in the body piercing community, which advocates piercing with needles. Shannon Larratt, editor and publisher of BME and a vocal critic of the piercing gun, penned an essay titled &quot;Piercing guns are blasphemy!&quot;, where he described the piercing gun as an inherently flawed, dangerous instrument that should never be used. Larratt also printed T-shirts which featured an image of a piercing gun with a red circle and line through it, to mean &quot;No Piercing Guns&quot;. BME also published an article titled &quot;Do Piercing Guns Suck?&quot;.

===Use on areas other than the ear lobe===
While they are sometimes used for this purpose, ear-piercing guns were not originally designed to pierce through the cartilage of the upper ear, or to pierce any part of the body other than the earlobe. Some U.S. states and some European countries have banned piercing guns for use on ear cartilage and nostrils. Improper use of ear-piercing instruments on areas of the body not intended for their use can lead to problems with healing and placement. Ear-piercing studs can be too short or wrongly shaped for the tissue, especially for oral piercings, and can lead to problems with &quot;embedding&quot; in which the wound effectively heals over it. In some cases this has necessitated surgical removal of the stud and can lead to abscesses, infection and scarring. For other body piercings, the gauge of the studs used by piercing guns is too narrow and can lead to tearing and other trauma that expose the body to infection and can cause permanent scarring.

<doc id="1228666" wikidata="Q5028701" url="?curid=1228666" title="Campus of Iowa State University">
<text>The Iowa State University campus contains over 160 buildings, several of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Iowa State University&#x27;s campus, specifically its Central Campus, has been recognized as one of the nation&#x27;s most beautiful and was listed as a &quot;medallion site&quot; by the American Society of Landscape Architects in 1999.

==Campus==

Iowa State&#x27;s main campus features 490 acres of trees, plants and classically designed buildings. The concept of an open central campus encircled by buildings, was the vision of Iowa State&#x27;s first president, Adonijah Welch. The campus is dominated by a large 20 acre central lawn known as Central Campus. Along with the University of Virginia and Yale University, ISU&#x27;s central campus was listed as a &quot;medallion site&quot; by the American Society of Landscape Architects in 1999. It was listed as one of 25 most beautiful sites in the United States in the book &quot;The Campus as a Work of Art&quot;.

===Fountain of Four Seasons===

The fountain was sculpted by Christian Petersen in 1941 after a request from Iowa State President Charles Friley. The previous fountain was a vertical water tower on which students would place toilet seats. President Friley hoped that with a new, beautiful fountain, students would no longer make jokes of it.

===Lake LaVerne===

Named for Dr. LaVerne W. Noyes, who also donated the funds to see that Alumni Hall could be completed after sitting unfinished and unused from 1905 to 1907. Dr. Noyes is an 1872 alumnus. Lake LaVerne is located west of the Memorial Union and south of Alumni Hall, Carver Hall, and Music Hall. The lake was a gift from Dr. Noyes in 1916.

Lake LaVerne is the home of two mute swans named Sir Lancelot and Elaine, donated to Iowa State by VEISHEA 1935. In 1944, 1970, and 1971 cygnets (baby swans) made their home on Lake LaVerne. Previously Sir Lancelot and Elaine were trumpeter swans but were too aggressive and in 1999 were replaced with two mute swans. In early 2002 Sir Lancelot suffered a broken foot from chasing a campus lawnmower. Sir Lancelot underwent surgery at Iowa State&#x27;s College of Veterinary Medicine, but after months of physical therapy efforts in returning him to Lake LaVerne were unsuccessful. Early spring 2003 Lake LaVerne welcomed is new and current mute swan duo. However, in support of DNR efforts to re-establish the trumpeter swans in Iowa, university officials avoided bringing breeding pairs of male and female mute swans to Iowa State which means the current Sir Lancelot and Elaine are both female.

===Marston Water Tower===

Iowa State is the home of the first elevated steel water tank west of the Mississippi River. Named the Marston Water Tower, it was erected in 1897 under the supervision and design of Anson Marston and his assistant Elmina Wilson. The water tower was constructed due to a severe water shortage in 1895 that forced cancellation of classes. In 1978, the water tower was disconnected when the university switched to municipal water. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on May 27, 1982, and restored in 1987.

The water tower stands tall on an octagonal base. The tank holds 162,000 US gallons (613 m3) and is in diameter and tall. When full, the of water would weigh 2,050 t.

<text>Monks Orchard is a suburb on the edge of the London Borough of Croydon, in the ceremonial county of Greater London, England, prior to 1965 it was located in the historical county of Surrey. It is situated about 10 miles (16.1 km) south south-east of Charing Cross, south of Elmers End and Eden Park, west of West Wickham, and north and east of Shirley and Shirley Oaks.

== History ==
Monks Orchard is not named after a monastery in the area, but in fact commemorates a family named Monk, from Addington, who owned a farm (Monksmead) and a wood (Monks Orchard) here in the 17th century. The land was acquired by Lewis Loyd in 1854, who built a mansion here and adopted the name of the Monks Orchard wood for the whole estate. Loyd&#x27;s Monks Orchard House was one of the most substantial mansions in the Croydon area. It had 19 bedrooms, a billiard room, library, and numerous other rooms; the Dining Hall alone was over x . The estate covered a huge area, , stretching northwards from the Wickham Road almost to Elmers End, southwards nearly as far as Addington, and eastwards across the County boundary into West Wickham. It also included several other major residences, such as Spring Park, farms, including Eden Park, Ham Farm, Shirley Farm, Spring Park Farm and Oak Lodge Farm, two dozen or so cottages, The Rising Sun, The Cricketers and the White Hart, and Beckenham Golf Course.

As late as 1923, the area was described in the following way: &quot;The Estate, which has an extensive frontage to the road between the villages of Shirley and West Wickham, is delightfully rural in character, typifying that which is best in the unspoiled English countryside. The land seems adapted by nature for those who are seeking country houses not too far from London, being already park-like meadow land, well timbered, and dotted with coppices; thus affording almost unlimited scope for imagination, and taste, in laying out grounds, by utilising the natural advantages already there.&quot;

When the estate came up for sale in 1920, only parts of it found buyers, and the rest, including the part now known as Monks Orchard, was offered again in 1924, and this was finally purchased by the Corporation of London for the relocation of the Bethlem Hospital, which had long outgrown its Lambeth home. Building of the new hospital started in 1928, which involved pulling down Loyd&#x27;s old mansion. The hospital development did not require all of the land and the remainders of it were sold off for housing development.

By 1937-1939, most of the current streets had been developed - Orchard Grove, Elstan Way, Greenview Avenue, and so on. A 1937 prospectus for the Tudor-style &quot;Homes of Distinction&quot; in Greenview Avenue extols the virtues of local building (&quot;There are no mass production houses and no mass production methods&quot;) and after describing the houses in great detail, claim that the fitted kitchenettes are &quot;the Housewife&#x27;s Dream virtually come true&quot;.

The Lawdon Estate was developed in the late 1960s and includes Regency Walk, Sloane Walk and Kempton Walk.

In 2015 the Bethlem Museum of the Mind opened in Bethlem Royal Hospital, which covers the history of the institution and changing attitudes to mental health over the decades.

==Amenities==
The area contains a small row of shops on Bywood Avenue, with a smaller parade on Orchard Way now reduced to just a Co-op supermarket following the closure of The Orchard pub in 2019. There is also an Anglican church, St George the Martyr, located on Elstan Way; the original church (now the church hall) was built in August 1937, with the current edifice being constructed in August 1952.

<doc id="1228671" wikidata="Q283909" url="?curid=1228671" title="Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria">
<text>Maximilian III of Austria (12 October 1558 – 2 November 1618), was a member of the House of Habsburg and the Archduke of Further Austria from 1612 until his death. He was also briefly known as Maximilian of Poland during his claim for the Polish throne. He would try to be elected as King of Poland he was defeated. He was also Grand Master of the Teutonic Order

==Biography==

Born in Wiener Neustadt, Maximilian was the fourth son of the Emperor Maximilian II and Maria of Spain. He was a grandson of Anna of Bohemia and Hungary, daughter and heiress of Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary, who himself was the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland from the Jagiellonian dynasty.

In 1585, Maximilian became the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order; thanks to this he was known by the epithet &quot;der Deutschmeister&quot; (&quot;the German Master&quot;) for much of his later life.

In the 1587 Polish–Lithuanian royal election Maximilian stood as a candidate for the throne of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, following the death of the previous king, Stephen Báthory. Nonetheless, a portion of the Polish nobility elected Maximilian king, but another faction elected Prince Sigismund of Sweden, grandson of Sigismund I the Old, as Sigismund III Vasa. However, he faced considerable opposition as well due to same reasons as before. Maximilian then invaded Poland, starting the War of the Polish Succession (1587–1588). He had considerable support in Poland, but fewer Poles flocked to his army than to that of his rival. In late 1587, he tried and failed to storm Kraków. At Pitschen in Silesia, he met Sigismund&#x27;s army, commanded by Polish hetman Jan Zamojski. In the Battle of Byczyna (24 January 1588), Maximilian was defeated and captured. He was released a year and half later after the intervention of Pope Sixtus V in the aftermath of the Treaty of Bytom and Będzin. In 1598, he formally renounced his claim to the Polish crown. The inactivity of his brother, Emperor Rudolf II, in this matter contributed to Rudolf&#x27;s poor reputation.

From 1593 to 1595, Maximilian served as regent for his young cousin, the future Emperor Ferdinand II as Archduke of Inner Austria. In 1595, Maximilian succeeded to the territories of their uncle Ferdinand II, Archduke of Further Austria, including Tyrol, where he proved to be a solid proponent of the Counter-Reformation. He also worked to depose Melchior Khlesl, and to ensure that Ferdinand succeeded as Holy Roman Emperor.

Today, Maximilian is perhaps best remembered for his baroque archducal hat, exhibited in the treasury of the monastery of Klosterneuburg and was used for ceremonial purposes as late as 1835.

He died at Vienna in 1618, and is buried in the canopied tomb in Innsbruck Cathedral.

<doc id="1228672" wikidata="Q1231054" url="?curid=1228672" title="Battle of Gaza (312 BC)">
<text>The Battle of Gaza of 312 BC, was fought between the invading army of Ptolemy I Soter and his ally Seleucus I Nicator and the defending army of Demetrius I of Macedon, son of Antigonus I Monophthalmus. The battle was part of the Third War of the Diadochi and was fought near the city of Gaza.

In late 312 BC, Ptolemy launched an invasion into the Levant from Egypt, he marched with 18,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry along the northern edge of the Sinai Peninsula. Receiving timely intelligence, Demetrius recalled his troops from their winter quarters and concentrated them at Gaza. Demetrius&#x27; advisors had apparently told him to avoid a military confrontation with Ptolemy and Seleucus, who had more military experience, but he ignored their advice; the conflict ended in a decisive defeat for Demetrius, subsequently enabling the absorption of his controlled territory by Ptolemy and Seleucus.

==Armies and deployment==

=== Troop strength ===
Demetrius deployed 2,900 elite cavalry, 1,500 light infantry, and 30 Indian war elephants under his command on the left. The Antigonid phalanx of some 11,000 was deployed in the center, with 13 war elephants in front and light infantry protecting the main line. On the Antigonid right, there were 1,500 cavalry.

Ptolemy and Seleucus originally put most of their cavalry on the left, but when they learned of Demetrius&#x27; disposition, they massed their 3,000 heavy cavalry to the right, under their personal command. An anti-elephant corps of 3,000 light infantry (peltast, archers and slingers) equipped with anti-elephant devices (spikes connected by chains) were positioned in front of the cavalry,– with orders to throw the devices in the path of the elephants and then target the mahouts. Their phalanx was stationed in the center, with the remaining 1,000 cavalry deployed on the right.

===Order of battle===
Antigonid:
* left wing: 2,900 cavalry, 1,500 light infantry and 30 war elephants under Demetrius command
* center: 11,000 infantry phalanx and 13 elephants
* right wing: 1,500 cavalry

Ptolemaic:
* left wing: 3,000 cavalry, under Ptolemy and Seleucus
* center: 18,000 phalanx
* right wing: 1,000 cavalry

==Engagement==

The battle opened with the advance guards of the stronger cavalry wings engaging each other. Demetrius drove off the enemy. Ptolemy and Seleucus responded by riding around Demetrius&#x27;s left flank to attack. A fierce melee ensued, with the cavalry of both sides fighting with their swords after their lances had been shattered. While the cavalry battle on the flank was taking place, Demetrius brought forward his elephants apparently hoping to demoralize the Ptolemaic phalanx. As the elephants approached, the Ptolemaic archers and javelinmen began showering the elephants and their crews. This, along with some elephants stepping on the spiked chains, led to them becoming panicked. After shooting down nearly all the crews, the Ptolemaic light infantry were able to capture and kill most of the elephants. The loss of the elephants panicked Demetrius&#x27; cavalry and many of his men retreated. The infantry then engaged, and the fight was stiff. However, neither phalanx could gain the upper hand. After trying to keep more cavalry from retreating, Demetrius and the remaining cavalry fell back but still managed to stay in formation while retiring over the open plain. This discouraged Ptolemy and Seleucus from pursuing the enemy. The Ptolemaic phalanx began to push back the Antigonid phalanx, and the Antigonid Phalangites threw down their arms and retreated in chaos. Ptolemy and Seleucus had won a hard-fought victory.

==Aftermath==
Demetrius lost 8,500 men (500 were killed in battle, a further 8,000 taken prisoner), including generals such as Andronicus of Olynthus, and all his elephants. He retreated to Tripolis in Phoenicia, and started to rebuild his army. He also sent a report to his father, who had just finished his campaign in Caria, urging him to send help.

Meanwhile, Seleucus had convinced Ptolemy to release him from service and give him an army to try and take back his old province of Babylonia which was now without a governor (Peithon had died in the battle). Ptolemy agreed, and sent off Seleucus with a small force of around 1,000 troops.

== In popular culture ==

Alfred Duggan&#x27;s novel on the life of Demetrius, &quot;Elephants and Castles&quot;, covers the battle.

The third novel in Christian Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Tyrant&quot; series, &quot;Funeral Games&quot; features the Battle of Gaza.

<text>Francisco Hermenegildo Tomás Garcés (April 12, 1738 – July 18, 1781) was a Spanish Franciscan friar who served as a missionary and explorer in the colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain. He explored much of the southwestern region of North America, including present day Sonora and Baja California in Mexico, and the U.S. states of Arizona and California.
He was killed along with his companion friars during an uprising by the Native American population, and they have been declared martyrs for the faith by the Catholic Church. The cause for his canonization was opened by the Church.

==History==
Garcés was born April 12, 1738, in Morata de Jalón, Aragon, north-central Spain. He entered the Franciscan Order about 1758 and was ordained a priest in 1763 in Spain.

===New Spain===

Garcés travelled to New Spain (Mexico) and served at the Franciscan college of Santa Cruz in Querétaro. In 1768, when the King of Spain expelled the Jesuits from their extensive mission system in northwestern New Spain (within present-day Baja California, northwestern Mexico, and the southwestern United States), Garcés was among the Franciscan replacements. He was assigned to Mission San Xavier del Bac in the Sonoran Desert, near present-day Tucson, Arizona.

====Missionary====
The expulsion of the Jesuits by the Spanish King set in motion a sequence of dramatic events in the missions. The Franciscans from the college of Santa Cruz in Querétaro took over responsibility in the Sonoran Desert missions region in the present-day Mexican state of Sonora and the U.S. state of Arizona. Meanwhile, other Franciscans from the college of San Fernando in Mexico City under the leadership of Junípero Serra, were assigned to replace the Jesuits in the Baja California missions of the lower Las Californias Province.

====Explorer====

Garcés became a key player in this effort, conducting extensive explorations in the Sonoran, Colorado, and Mojave Deserts, the Gila River, and the Colorado River from the Gulf of California and Lower Colorado River Valley to the Grand Canyon. He encountered and recorded accounts of the Native American tribes in their desert and riparian valley homelands, and established peaceable relations for the Crown, including with the Quechan, Mojave, Hopi, and Havasupai. Many journeys were explorations on his own in the deserts. He accompanied soldier-explorer Juan Bautista de Anza part way in both his large overland expeditions: the 1774 De Anza Expedition - first to reach Alta California&#x27;s Pacific coast from the east; and the 1775-76 Anza Colonizing Expedition, which traveled as far north as San Francisco Bay. Garcés also crossed the Mojave Desert on the Mohave Trail and then the Old Tejon Pass and explored the southern San Joaquin Valley in 1776. The eastern part of the route Garcés took from the Colorado River across the Mojave Desert is known to four-wheel-drive adventurers today as the Mojave Road.

====Death====
In 1779–81 Garcés and Juan Díaz established two mission churches (Mission Puerto de Purísima Concepción and Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicuñer) on the lower Colorado River at Yuma Crossing, as part of a new pueblo (secular settlement), in the homeland of the Quechan peoples (Yuma or Kwítsaín). Garcés tried to keep peace between all parties. The formerly peaceful rapport with the Quechan was lost due to Spanish settlers allegedly violating the treaty with the native peoples, resulting in the losses of crops and farmlands. In July 1781, Garcés, Díaz and their fellow friars were among those killed in a violent uprising at the Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicuñer, known as the Yuma Uprising and Yuma Revolt.

Garcés&#x27; body was later reinterred at Mission San Pedro y San Pablo del Tubutama. He and the other friars killed at those missions are considered martyrs by the Catholic Church.

==Legacy==

;El Garces Hotel
The El Garces Hotel, named in Francisco Garcés&#x27; honor, is the historic 1908 Santa Fe Railroad station and Harvey House hotel &#x27;oasis&#x27; located in the City of Needles. It is located in eastern California above the Colorado River, a site Garcés passed through during the 1776 Anza expedition. The El Garces Hotel was built by the Santa Fe Railroad under contract with the Fred Harvey Company. It is designed in an elegant Neoclassical and Beaux-Arts style, and the El Garces was considered the &quot;Crown Jewel&quot; of the entire Fred Harvey chain.

;National Forest
Garces National Forest was established by the U.S. Forest Service in southern Arizona on July 1, 1908, with from portions of Baboquivari, Tumacacori and Huachuca National Forests. The name was discontinued in 1911 when it was combined with Coronado National Forest.

;Bakersfield
The first Tejon Pass (original) between the Mojave Desert (and New Spain) over the Tehachapi Mountains to the southern San Joaquin Valley floor (future site of Bakersfield), California, had been discovered by Garcés in 1776, eastward from the Anza Colonizing Expedition route. Therefore, there are several landmarks for Francisco Garcés in Bakersfield, California: Garces Memorial High School, the city&#x27;s Catholic high school; and on Chester Avenue Garces Memorial Circle, with a memorial statue of Garcés.

;Las Vegas, Nevada 
The original platted east–west streets of the 1905 Las Vegas Township are all named for significant North American explorers, beginning with Stewart on the north, then Ogden, Fremont, Carson, Bridger, Lewis, Clark, Bonneville, Gass, and finally Garces on the south.

; Reno, Nevada
St. Thomas Aquinas Cathedral has a stained glass window dedicated to Fray Garces.

<doc id="1228679" wikidata="Q634552" url="?curid=1228679" title="Gyromagnetic ratio">
<text>In physics, the gyromagnetic ratio (also sometimes known as the magnetogyric ratio in other disciplines) of a particle or system is the ratio of its magnetic moment to its angular momentum, and it is often denoted by the symbol , gamma. Its SI unit is the radian per second per tesla (rad⋅s−1⋅T−1) or, equivalently, the coulomb per kilogram (C⋅kg−1).

The term &quot;gyromagnetic ratio&quot; is often used as a synonym for a &quot;different&quot; but closely related quantity, the -factor. The -factor only differs from the gyromagnetic ratio in being dimensionless.

==For a classical rotating body==
Consider a nonconductive charged body rotating about an axis of symmetry. According to the laws of classical physics, it has both a magnetic dipole moment due to the movement of charge and an angular momentum due to the movement of mass arising from its rotation. It can be shown that as long as its charge and mass density and flow are distributed identically and rotationally symmetric, its gyromagnetic ratio is 
:formula_1
where formula_2 is its charge, and formula_3 is its mass.

The derivation of this relation is as follows. It suffices to demonstrate this for an infinitesimally narrow circular ring within the body, as the general result then follows from an integration. Suppose the ring has radius , area , mass , charge , and angular momentum . Then the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment is
:formula_4

==For an isolated electron==
An isolated electron has an angular momentum and a magnetic moment resulting from its spin. While an electron&#x27;s spin is sometimes visualized as a literal rotation about an axis, it cannot be attributed to mass distributed identically to the charge. The above classical relation does not hold, giving the wrong result by the absolute value of the electron&#x27;s -factor, which is denoted :
formula_5
where is the Bohr magneton.

The gyromagnetic ratio due to electron spin is twice that due to the orbiting of an electron.

In the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics,
formula_6
where formula_7 is the fine-structure constant. Here the small corrections to the relativistic result come from the quantum field theory calculations of the anomalous magnetic dipole moment. The electron -factor is known to twelve decimal places by measuring the electron magnetic moment in a one-electron cyclotron:
formula_8

The electron gyromagnetic ratio is
formula_9
formula_10

The electron -factor and are in excellent agreement with theory; see &quot;Precision tests of QED&quot; for details.

==Gyromagnetic factor not as a consequence of relativity==
Since a gyromagnetic factor equal to 2 follows from Dirac&#x27;s equation, it is a frequent misconception to think that a -factor 2 is a consequence of relativity; it is not. The factor 2 can be obtained from the linearization of both the Schrödinger equation and the relativistic Klein–Gordon equation (which leads to Dirac&#x27;s). In both cases a 4-spinor is obtained and for both linearizations the -factor is found to be equal to 2. Therefore, the factor 2 is a consequence of the minimal coupling and of the fact of having the same order of derivatives for space and time.

Physical spin- particles which cannot be described by the linear gauged Dirac equation satisfy the gauged Klein–Gordon equation extended by the term according to,
:formula_11

Here, and stand for the Lorentz group generators in the Dirac space, and the electromagnetic tensor respectively, while is the electromagnetic four-potential. An example for such a particle is the spin companion to spin in the representation space of the Lorentz group. This particle has been shown to be characterized by and consequently to behave as a truly quadratic fermion.

==For a nucleus==

Protons, neutrons, and many nuclei carry nuclear spin, which gives rise to a gyromagnetic ratio as above. The ratio is conventionally written in terms of the proton mass and charge, even for neutrons and for other nuclei, for the sake of simplicity and consistency. The formula is:
:formula_12
where formula_13 is the nuclear magneton, and formula_14 is the -factor of the nucleon or nucleus in question. The ratio formula_15 MHz/T.

The gyromagnetic ratio of a nucleus plays a role in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These procedures rely on the fact that bulk magnetization due to nuclear spins precess in a magnetic field at a rate called the Larmor frequency, which is simply the product of the gyromagnetic ratio with the magnetic field strength. With this phenomenon, the sign of determines the sense (clockwise vs counterclockwise) of precession.

Most common nuclei such as 1H and 13C have positive gyromagnetic ratios. Approximate values for some common nuclei are given in the table below.

== Larmor precession ==

Any free system with a constant gyromagnetic ratio, such as a rigid system of charges, a nucleus, or an electron, when placed in an external magnetic field (measured in teslas) that is not aligned with its magnetic moment, will precess at a frequency (measured in hertz) proportional to the external field:
:formula_16
For this reason, values of , in units of hertz per tesla (Hz/T), are often quoted instead of .

=== Heuristic derivation ===
The derivation of this ratio is as follows: First we must prove the torque resulting from subjecting a magnetic moment formula_17 to a magnetic field formula_18 is formula_19 The identity of the functional form of the stationary electric and magnetic fields has led to defining the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment equally well as formula_20, or in the following way, imitating the moment of an electric dipole: The magnetic dipole can be represented by a needle of a compass with fictitious magnetic charges formula_21 on the two poles and vector distance between the poles formula_22 under the influence of the magnetic field of earth formula_23 By classical mechanics the torque on this needle is formula_24 But as previously stated formula_25 so the desired formula comes up. formula_26 is the unit distance vector.

The spinning electron model here is analogous to a gyroscope. For any rotating body the rate of change of the angular momentum formula_27 equals the applied torque formula_28:
: formula_29

Note as an example the precession of a gyroscope. The earth&#x27;s gravitational attraction applies a force or torque to the gyroscope in the vertical direction, and the angular momentum vector along the axis of the gyroscope rotates slowly about a vertical line through the pivot. In place of a gyroscope, imagine a sphere spinning around the axis with its center on the pivot of the gyroscope, and along the axis of the gyroscope two oppositely directed vectors both originated in the center of the sphere, upwards formula_27 and downwards formula_31 Replace the gravity with a magnetic flux density formula_23

formula_33 represents the linear velocity of the pike of the arrow formula_27 along a circle whose radius is formula_35 where formula_36 is the angle between formula_27 and the vertical. Hence the angular velocity of the rotation of the spin is
:formula_38

Consequently, formula_39
This relationship also explains an apparent contradiction between the two equivalent terms, &quot;gyromagnetic&quot; ratio versus &quot;magnetogyric&quot; ratio: whereas it is a ratio of a magnetic property (i.e. dipole moment) to a &quot;gyric&quot; (rotational, from , &quot;turn&quot;) property (i.e. angular momentum), it is also a ratio between the angular precession frequency (another &quot;gyric&quot; property) and the magnetic field.

The angular precession frequency has an important physical meaning: It is the angular cyclotron frequency, the resonance frequency of an ionized plasma being under the influence of a static finite magnetic field, when we superimpose a high frequency electromagnetic field.

<text>Dean Chamberlain is a photographer who specializes in unique lighting effects and extended exposure times. Famous models for his pictures sit for up to five hours as he leaves the camera shutter open and &quot;paints&quot; the space around them with carried and projected lights of various colors and shapes, creating luminous and colorful images. His technique was described by one of his exhibitions as &quot;Painting With Light Through Time and Space.&quot;

Chamberlain served as Artist in Residence at Dartmouth College in 1989. In 1994 his work appeared in &quot;Nervous Landscapes&quot;, a book which accompanied an exhibition at the Southeast Museum of Photography. He co-founded the Light Space Gallery in Venice, California in 2001, and serves as its co-director. Since 2003 Chamberlain has been a contributor to &quot;Mao Mag&quot;, an insiders&#x27; art and fashion magazine. A documentary of his work is planned for release on Ovation TV in 2010.

He has taken art photographs of people from many walks of life. A &quot;Psychedelic Pioneers&quot; series of limited edition prints included portraits of Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, Albert Hofmann, Laura Huxley, Alexander Shulgin, Rick Doblin, Oscar Janiger, Stan Grof, Terence McKenna, and John C. Lilly.; another series documented artists like Keith Haring and Jeff Koons. He has also created portraits for musicians such as David Bowie, Duran Duran, Debbie Harry, Paul McCartney, Madonna, Arcadia, Roy Orbison, and directed music videos using the same long exposure techniques: &quot;This One&quot; for Paul and Linda McCartney, &quot;Missing&quot; for Arcadia and &quot;All She Wants Is&quot; for Duran Duran. &quot;All She Wants Is&quot; won an MTV Video Music Award for innovation.

Chamberlain was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He first became interested in photography when he was thirteen using a Polaroid camera, and by fifteen had acquired his first Konica. He had always wanted to be an artist and was inspired by his grandmother who encouraged him to paint on canvas. He attended Sheridan College and Rochester Institute of Technology and by his early twenties he knew he was a light painter, and has focused on this technique ever since. He was very interested in the psychedelic movement, and became a friend to Timothy Leary late in his life. In 2003 his gallery put on a showing of art and memorabilia that Chamberlain selected from Leary&#x27;s archives after his death.

<doc id="1228714" wikidata="Q336420" url="?curid=1228714" title="Nazir Ahmed, Baron Ahmed">
<text>Nazir Ahmed, Baron Ahmed (; born 24 April 1957), is a British former politician. As a member of the Labour Party, he was appointed a life peer in 1998.

Ahmed faced expulsion from the House of Lords in 2020 on account of sexually exploiting a woman who had approached him in 2017 in his capacity as a member of the House, and resigned from the House after a recommendation of its Conduct Committee that he be expelled, but before it was implemented. However, he continues to be a life peer, although not a member of the House. On 5 January 2022 he was found guilty of historical sex offences, committed when he was a teenager, being the attempted rape of a child under 13 years of age and sexual assault of another. He was sentenced to five years and six months in prison, reduced on appeal to two years and six months.

== Early life ==
Ahmed was born in Mirpur, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan on 24 April 1957 to Haji Sain Mohammed and Rashim Bibi. His parents migrated the family to the United Kingdom when he was 2 and he has lived in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, since 1959. He attended Spurley Hey Comprehensive School, then Thomas Rotherham Sixth Form College. He studied for a degree in public administration at Sheffield Polytechnic and joined the Labour Party when he was 18 years old.

== Politics ==
In 1990 Ahmed began his political career as a local Labour Party councillor, becoming the chair of the South Yorkshire Labour Party in 1993 and holding both positions until 2000. He founded the British Muslim Councillors&#x27; Forum and was a magistrate between 1992 and 2000. He was the first Asian councillor in Rotherham and the town&#x27;s youngest magistrate. He enjoyed backing from the Pakistan government, and was known for lobbying in the British Parliament on the Kashmir issue on Pakistan&#x27;s behalf. This advocacy included holding anti-India protests outside the Indian Embassy in London. He claims to have changed the policies of the Labour Party to the extent that, for the first time in British history, Kashmir was discussed on the floor of the conference. He is associated with the Justice Foundation, which organised that conference and whose director at that time was Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai – a Pakistani Kashmir lobbyist arrested by the USA for spying and illegal lobbying, and according to US prosecutors the Justice Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Kashmir Centres&quot; in UK, USA and Saudi Arabia are run on behalf of the Pakistani government and its military intelligence Inter-Services Intelligence Agency.

Ahmed was created a life peer, Baron Ahmed, &quot;of Rotherham in the County of South Yorkshire&quot;, on 3 August 1998. Although there have been many claims that he was the first Muslim life peer, including by Ahmed himself, or the first male Muslim peer, he was in fact the third Muslim life peer; the other two, Baroness Uddin and Lord Alli, were raised to the Peerage on 18 July whereas Lord Ahmed was so raised on 3 August. There have been earlier Muslim hereditary peers, the first being the 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley in 1869.

He led the first delegation on behalf of the British Government on the Muslim pilgrimage of the Hajj. At home, he spoke on wider equality issues, and spoke several times on issues of race, religion and gender; he advocated legislation against religious discrimination and forced marriage.

In August 2006 he was a signatory to an open letter to prime minister Tony Blair criticising the UK&#x27;s foreign policy.

On 19 June 2007 Ahmed criticised the honouring of Salman Rushdie with a knighthood because of what he saw as Rushdie&#x27;s offensiveness to Islam. He was reported to have said, &quot;It&#x27;s hypocrisy by Tony Blair, who two weeks ago was talking about building bridges to mainstream Muslims, and then he&#x27;s honouring a man who has insulted the British public and been divisive in community relations.&quot; &quot;This man not only provoked violence around the world because of his writings, but there were many people who were killed around the world. Forgiving and forgetting is one thing, but honouring the man who has blood on his hands, sort of, because of what he did, I think is going a bit too far.&quot; He also said on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;PM&quot; programme that he had been appalled by the award to a man he accused of having &#x27;blood on his hands&#x27;.

In September 2007, Ahmed flew to Islamabad with Pakistan&#x27;s former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, in a bid to end Sharif&#x27;s exile from the country by military ruler Pervez Musharraf, who had ousted him in a coup d&#x27;état. He negotiated with police to allow Sharif to enter the airport terminal and pass through customs, but Sharif was arrested later, and deported.

After the reform of the House of Lords, Ahmed took over from Lord Sudeley to act as Host for the Forum for Stable Currencies.

In November 2007 Ahmed was involved in a diplomatic effort to secure the release of Gillian Gibbons from custody in Sudan. The teacher, Gillian Gibbons, allowed her class to name a teddy bear Muhammad. Ahmed, from Britain&#x27;s ruling Labour Party, and Baroness Warsi, an opposition Conservative, visited Khartoum and had a meeting with the President of Sudan. Miss Gibbons, who had been given a fifteen-day prison sentence, was released after eight days following a Presidential pardon and allowed to return to the UK.

In June 2008, the political editor of &quot;Newsnight&quot;, Michael Crick, reported that Ahmed had been rumoured to be preparing to defect to the Conservative Party, but that he had denied this.

On 13 May 2013, two days before he was scheduled to appear before the Labour National Executive Committee in relation to antisemitic remarks he allegedly made in an interview on television in Pakistan, Ahmed resigned from the Labour party, saying that he could not expect a fair hearing.

== Activities ==
Ahmed has operated as a property developer concurrent with his political career. He was a supporter of Fauji Foundation and the affairs of the Pakistan Army throughout. Ahmed has exploited various charitable causes and has been on the board of several organisations, including a period as president of South Yorkshire Victim Support and as a trustee of the British Heart Foundation. He resigned from his position as a trustee of the Joseph Interfaith Foundation in March 2013 as a result of the allegations of antisemitism.

==Controversies==
In December 2001, Ahmed claimed that his phone had been tapped by the government because of his opposition to its intervention in Afghanistan. He claimed he had a heated conversation with Foreign Office minister Denis MacShane, during which MacShane claimed to have transcripts of Ahmed&#x27;s private conversations. The government denied that Ahmed was under surveillance, and MacShane said that his remarks had been misinterpreted.

In 2002, Ahmed was accused by campaign group Baby Milk Action of changing his position on Nestlé&#x27;s sale of baby milk in Pakistan at a time when he was negotiating a paid advisory role with the company: he subsequently became a consultant.

On 25 July 2005, Ahmed, while interviewing with Robert Siegel on National Public Radio, said that the suicide bombers of 7/7 had an &quot;identity crisis&quot; and that &quot;unfortunately, our imams and mosques have not been able to communicate the true message of Islam in the language that these young people can understand.&quot; Christopher Orlet of &quot;The American Spectator&quot; did not agree with Ahmed&#x27;s &quot;identity crisis&quot;. He said, &quot;That&#x27;s not an identity crisis, Lord Ahmed, that&#x27;s religious psychopathy. That&#x27;s a bloodthirstiness that makes Dracula look like a teetotaler.&quot; Ahmed did acknowledge, &quot;the community leaders and religious leaders, who have kept very close contacts with South Asia and the Middle East rather than keeping a good contact with the British society where we live.&quot;

On 30 November 2006, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; reported a claim by fellow Muslim and Labour parliamentarian Shahid Malik that Ahmed had campaigned against him during the Dewsbury election in 2005. He alleged that Ahmed instead backed Sayeeda Warsi, vice-chair of the Conservative Party, the daughter of a personal friend. According to the New Statesman&#x27;s report, Warsi &quot;welcomed Lord Ahmed&#x27;s support&quot;. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; also printed Ahmed&#x27;s denial, saying &quot;I never told any constituent of Dewsbury to vote for the Tories&quot;.

On 3 February 2009, Melanie Phillips, a newspaper columnist, claimed that Ahmed had threatened to mobilise 10,000 Muslims to prevent anti-Islamist Dutch MP Geert Wilders from entering the House of Lords to speak at a screening of the film &quot;Fitna&quot;. Wilders had been invited by a peer to debate issues of social inclusion. This claim was later denied by Ahmed, but the House of Lords authorities had determined to provide adequate security, if necessary. In the event, the film &quot;Fitna&quot; was broadcast as planned, but Wilders was denied entry to the UK, thus leading many commentators to deplore the action by the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith as appeasement.

===Imprisonment for dangerous driving===
On 25 December 2007, Ahmed was involved in a crash on the M1 motorway near Rotherham in which Martin Gombar, 28, was killed. Gombar&#x27;s car had been involved in a crash and he had left it in the outer lane. Apparently trying to return to his vehicle from the hard shoulder he was hit by Ahmed, who was driving his Jaguar X-Type. Ahmed&#x27;s wife and mother, who were passengers in the car, also received minor injuries.

On 1 December 2008, Ahmed appeared at Sheffield Magistrates&#x27; Court on a charge of dangerous driving. Ahmed admitted sending and receiving five text messages on his phone while driving two minutes before the crash, and pleaded guilty. He was banned from driving until his sentencing. On 22 December, Sheffield Magistrates&#x27; Court referred the case for sentencing at Sheffield Crown Court on 19 January due to its &quot;aggravating features&quot;. This was later put back until 25 February. Ahmed was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, which meant he would serve six weeks in jail, and he was disqualified from driving for 12 months.

On 12 March 2009 Ahmed’s sentence was varied by the Court of Appeal. Lady Justice Hallett said it was important to state that Ahmed&#x27;s offence was one of dangerous driving, not of causing death by dangerous driving. Hallett said that there was &quot;little or nothing&quot; Ahmed could have done to avoid the collision and that after being knocked unconscious, he had come to and &quot;risked his life trying to flag down other vehicles to stop them colliding with the Audi or his car&quot;. She said that while his prison sentence had been justified, the court had been persuaded it could now take an &quot;exceptional&quot; course and suspend the sentence for 12 months. He was released (subject to the suspended sentence) 16 days into his original sentence.

In subsequent interviews, Ahmed incorrectly stated that he had no criminal record and that his sentence was overturned.

===Bounty allegation===
A Pakistani newspaper, &quot;The Express Tribune&quot;, erroneously alleged that Ahmed said &quot;If the US can announce a reward of $10 million for the captor of Hafiz Saeed, I can announce a bounty of £10 million on President Obama and his predecessor George Bush&quot;, at a business meeting in Haripur, Pakistan, on 15 April 2012. On learning of these allegations, the Labour Party immediately suspended Ahmed pending a formal investigation. He later responded by stating &quot;I&#x27;m shocked and horrified that this whole story could be just made up of lies...&quot; Ahmed went on to say that he was not issuing a bounty but rather calls for the prosecution of George W. Bush and Tony Blair due to the &quot;war crimes committed in Iraq and Afghanistan&quot; in what he considers to be &quot;illegal wars&quot;.

Video footage of the meeting, released on 18 April, showed that Ahmed had been misquoted and instead had said, &quot;Even if I have to beg I am willing to raise and offer £10 million so that George W Bush and Tony Blair can be brought to the International Court of Justice on war crimes charges.&quot; The same day, &quot;The Express Tribune&quot; offered a &quot;clarification&quot; that it had &quot;erroneously reported&quot; Ahmed&#x27;s statement and that their reporter had incorrectly cited the name of Obama. The article stated that the newspaper &quot;deeply regretted&quot; its mistake. His suspension was revoked on 25 June 2012.

===Malala accusation===

In November 2012 Ahmed claimed that the attempted assassination of Malala Yousafzai by the Pakistani Taliban (not the main Afghan Taliban), might have been carried out by unnamed official elements in Pakistan as part of an effort to discredit the Pakistani Taliban. He subsequently accepted that he gave the speech whilst having &quot;no idea what happened&quot; and that this was not the case.

===Controversial remarks following driving conviction===

On 14 March 2013, The Times reported that Nazir Ahmed had claimed in a 2012 interview with a Pakistani television channel that he was jailed for 12 weeks for sending and receiving text messages while driving due to pressure from Jewish-owned media. He alleged that his case became more critical because of his support for Palestinians, stating, “My Jewish friends who own newspapers and TV channels opposed [speaking out in favor of Palestine].” Ahmed also suggested that the judge in his case was specifically selected due to connections with a Jewish colleague of former Prime Minister Tony Blair. 

Ahmed’s remarks drew widespread criticism. The Labour Party suspended him, stating it “deplores and does not tolerate any sort of racism or antisemitism.” Jewish organizations, including the Board of Deputies of British Jews, condemned his comments, describing them as perpetuating harmful conspiracy theories. Ahmed initially denied recalling the remarks but later apologized, describing his comments as “completely unacceptable” and the product of a “twisted mind.”

===Allegations of sexual impropriety===
In February 2019, Ahmed was accused of using his position in the House of Lords to have sex with vulnerable women. One of the women, Tahira Zaman, explained how the pair went on to have an intimate sexual relationship after she had approached Ahmed for help with a personal matter in February 2017. A second woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, also alleged that when she asked Ahmed for help he suggested she should spend the night at his London home which she refused as she interpreted this as a proposition for sex. Ahmed denied acting inappropriately. House of Lords Commissioner for Standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, found Tahira Zaman&#x27;s accusations credible and substantial, but no further action was then taken against Ahmed as his actions did not relate to his parliamentary duties.

==Convictions of attempted rape and sexual assault==
On 1 March 2019, Ahmed was charged with two offences of attempted rape and one offence of indecent assault between 1971 and 1974. The alleged victims were at the time a boy and a girl, both under the age of 13. The incidents reportedly took place between 1971 and 1974 while Ahmed was a teenager aged between 14 and 17 living in Rotherham.

He appeared at Sheffield Magistrates&#x27; Court with co-accused two brothers also facing charges on 19 March 2019; they were all granted bail to appear at Sheffield Crown Court on 16 April. On that date, his trial was fixed for 2 December 2019 and he was released on bail. His elder brother, Mohammed Farouq, was charged with four counts of indecent assault against a boy under the age of eight. Another elder brother, Mohammed Tariq, was charged with two counts of indecent assault against a boy under 11. Ahmed stood trial in February 2021 after his initial trial dates in 2020 were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He denied the allegations. His brothers were judged unfit to stand trial by the judge and instead faced a trial of the facts. On 22 February, the jury in the trial were discharged for legal reasons. Ahmed stood trial again in November 2021 when he continued to deny the allegations against him. On 5 January 2022 he was found guilty of attempted rape of a girl and of a serious sexual assault upon a boy. On 4 February 2022, Mr Justice Lavender sentenced Ahmed to five years and six months in prison.

An appeal against the sentence was lodged and in March 2023 the Court of Appeal ruled that the three-and-a-half-year sentence imposed for the charge of buggery was excessive as he was still a child himself when the offence was committed and that the trial judge should have taken this into account when sentencing Ahmed. The sentences of two years for the attempted rapes offences were unchanged, resulting in the total sentence being reduced from five and a half years to two and a half years.

An appeal against the conviction was heard in July 2023 and was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

Ahmed&#x27;s male victim, and the Muslim Women&#x27;s Network UK, called for him to lose his title over his conviction. Under the House of Lords rules, a member convicted of a serious criminal offence resulting in a jail sentence of at least one year can be expelled from the House; though an expelled peer still retains their title, which can only be removed by an act of parliament.

==Departure from House of Lords==

The Conduct Committee of the House of Lords considered in 2020 a complaint from a member of the public who had approached Lord Ahmed in 2017 in his capacity as a member of the House. Her complaint was that he &quot;initially made unwanted physical contact of a sexual nature with her and later held out the promise of using his influence to help her, when in fact his aim was to have sex with her&quot;. The Commissioner concluded that on the balance of probabilities Lord Ahmed&#x27;s actions put him &quot;in breach of the Code by failing to act on his personal honour&quot;. The Committee on 17 November 2020 published its report, recommending that &quot;Lord Ahmed be expelled from the House under Standing Order 12&quot;. It was the first time that expulsion of a peer from the House of Lords had been recommended.

After seeing the report, and before any action was taken, Lord Ahmed resigned from the House of Lords. He continues to hold the title of a life peer.

In 2024, while imprisoned, Ahmed appealled to the European Court of Human Rights, seeking to have the Parliamentary report overturned on the basis that the Lords investigation had breached his right to privacy and had &quot;devastating consequences for his private and family life.&quot; The court rejected Ahmed&#x27;s appeal.

==Family life==
Ahmed married Sakina Bibi in 1974. They have a daughter and two sons. As of 2008, he lived in Rotherham.

<text>Sturmbannführer (; ) was a Nazi Party paramilitary rank equivalent to major that was used in several Nazi organizations, such as the SA, SS, and the NSFK. The rank originated from German shock troop units of the First World War.
The SA title of &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; was first established in 1921. In 1928, the title became an actual rank and was also one of the first established SS ranks. The insignia of a &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; was four silver pips centered on a collar patch. The rank rated below &quot;Standartenführer&quot; until 1932, when &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; became subordinate to the new rank of &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot;. In the Waffen-SS, &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; was considered equivalent to a major in the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.

Various Waffen-SS units composed of foreign recruits were considered distinct from the German SS, and thus they were not permitted to wear SS runes on their collar tabs but had their divisional insignia instead. Their ranks were also prepended with &quot;Waffen&quot; instead of &quot;SS&quot;, as in, Waffen-Sturmbannführer.

The rank was held by Wernher von Braun, who developed the V-2 rocket, and later designed the Saturn V rocket for the U.S. space program. Other rank holders included Eberhard Heder, Otto Günsche, and war criminals, such as Otto Förschner, who was the commandant of Dora-Mittelbau concentration camp.

<text>Patricia Demick (born January 26, 1972) is a female boxer.

== Biography ==

=== Career ===
While she is better known as a boxer, she has also posed as a model for various magazines, often wearing sports bikinis and boxing gloves. This has, in turn, made her kind of an unlikely sex symbol to her fans in Chile, and to women&#x27;s boxing fans in the United States.

Patricia Demick became an American citizen after marrying her American trainer.

Demick&#x27;s professional boxing career began on March 26, 1999, when she knocked out experienced Karen Rios in the first round, at Hialeah, Florida. She won her next two fights, also by knockout.

After winning her first three fights by knockout, Demick and her managing team felt it was time to step up in her opposition&#x27;s quality level, so Demick fought Puerto Rican Daisy Ocasio and former world champion Marsha Valley, losing back to back six round unanimous decisions to them.

After three more wins, she received her first world title try: On June 16, 2001, she fought Valérie Hénin  in Anchorage, Alaska, for the WIBF world Welterweight title. The fight was declared a draw (tie) after ten rounds, but the scoring was controversial; many fans that saw the fight thought Demick deserved the decision.

Her next fight would prove to be even more controversial. She challenged Karla Redo for the WIBA&#x27;s world Welterweight title, in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Demick became world champion by accident, as she was declared the fight&#x27;s winner after eight rounds.

Demick made history for Chilean boxing that night, but her joy only lasted a few hours, because it was discovered that the judges had added their scorecards wrongly, therefore, Demick ultimately ended up losing the fight by an eight round decision.

== Acknowledgments ==
Demick went on to win two of the next three fights she had since that fight took place.

She currently holds a record of 8 wins, 4 losses, and one draw, with 5 knockout wins. She has not had a boxing contest since 2003.

<text>The Man Outside (, literally &quot;Outside, at the door&quot;) is a play by Wolfgang Borchert, written in a few days in the late autumn of 1946. It made its debut on German radio on 13 February 1947.

&quot;The Man Outside&quot; describes the hopelessness of a post-war soldier called Beckmann who returns from Russia to find that he has lost his wife and his home, as well as his illusions and beliefs. He finds every door he comes to closed; even nature seems to reject him.

Due to its release during the sensitive immediate postwar period, Borchert subtitled his play &quot;A play that no theatre wants to perform and no audience wants to see.&quot; Despite this, the first radio broadcast (February 1947) was very successful. The first theatrical production of &quot;The Man Outside&quot; (at the &quot;Hamburger Kammerspiele&quot;) opened on the day after Borchert&#x27;s death, 21 November 1947.

The play consists of five scenes in one act. It makes use of expressionist forms and Brechtian techniques, such as the &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot; (estrangement effect) to disorient and engage its audience.

==Characters==
The list of characters, translated from the original text of the play:

*Beckmann, one of them
*His Wife, who forgot him
*Her Friend, who loves her
*A Woman, whose husband came home with one leg
*Her Husband, who dreamed of her for a thousand nights
*A Colonel, who is very merry
*His Wife, feeling so cold in her warm parlour
*The Daughter, just over for dinner
*Her Courageous Husband
*A Cabaret Director, with daring goals, but less stamina
*Frau Kramer, who is just Frau Kramer, which is horrible
*The Old Man, in whom no one believes anymore
*The Undertaker with a case of the hiccups
*A Street Sweeper, who actually does not have that profession
*The Other, whom everyone knows
*The Elbe

Following the character list, there is a short introduction (two paragraphs) to the play (similar to the original dramatic use of a prologue): &quot;A man&quot; (Beckmann) returns to his German home town, but there is nobody to go to. At first, he feels distanced from his life, thinking it is a film. But slowly he realizes that it is an &quot;all-day film&quot;.

==Plot synopsis==

===Prologue===
The play begins with an overfed undertaker (apparently Death) with gas (belching) examining a body by the river Elbe, not the first one. The body does not appear to belong to a soldier, although he is wearing soldier&#x27;s clothes. The undertaker makes the nihilistic claim that this death changes nothing. The Old Man (apparently God) enters, crying and explaining: His children are killing each other. Since no one believes in him anymore, he can do nothing to stop them. Uninterested, the undertaker agrees that this is very tragic indeed.

God says that Death is the new God; people believe only in death. However, God remembers a skinny, sickly death. Death explains that he has grown fat during the last century, due to all the &quot;business&quot; from the war, and that is the cause of his belching. The scene ends with Death telling God to take a rest for emotional rehabilitation.

===Dream===
Beckmann awakes (after his suicide attempt) to find himself floating in the Elbe. The river turns out to be a rather resolute motherly figure. Once she discovers that Beckmann is bent on suicide, she lashes out, patronizing him. She calls him faint-hearted and explains that she will not let him kill himself. The dream ends with him washing up on the sand.

===Scene one===
The Other introduces himself to Beckmann. He describes himself as the &quot;yes-man&quot;. Annoyed, Beckmann tells him to leave. Thereafter, a girl turns up offering to help Beckmann, by giving him dry clothing and some warmth. She explains that she&#x27;s only helping him because he&#x27;s so wet and cold; later, she will admit having helped him because he looked so sad and innocent.

===Scene two===
Beckmann follows the girl to her house, where he finds out that her husband had been a soldier, like Beckmann. The girl laughs at Beckmann&#x27;s gasmask goggles, which he continues to wear, because without them he can&#x27;t see. She confiscates them, and he sees the world as grey and blurry. But, her husband comes home, on crutches. It turns out this is due to a military command of sergeant Beckmann that he lost his leg.

Beckmann attempts to go back to the Elbe for another try to die, but the Other convinces him not to. Instead, Beckmann is going to visit the man who had given the commands to him.

===Scene three===
The third scene marks the emotional climax of the play. Beckmann appears at his former Colonel&#x27;s house, just in time for dinner. He immediately blames the Colonel, telling him that for 3 years he ate caviar while the men suffered. He tells the Colonel about his nightmare.

In that dream, a fat man (Death again) plays a Military March on a very large xylophone made from human bones. The man is running back and forth, sweating blood. The blood gives him red stripes down the side of his trousers (like that of a General in the German Army.) All the dead from throughout history are there, and Beckmann is forced to stand there among them, under a sickly, discolored moon. And they are all chanting &quot;Beckmann! Sergeant Beckmann!&quot;

Beckmann tells the Colonel that he has returned to hand back to the Colonel the responsibility for the eleven men lost under his command. If he were able to sleep with those thousands killed in action under his command, eleven more will not change anything for him. The Colonel finds this whole idea very strange declaring it to be a joke out of place. He suggests that Beckmann takes his joke to the stage. Beckmann steals a bottle of rum and some bread from the dinner table, then leaves.

===Scene four===
The scene opens with a monologue from the &quot;Direktor&quot; (i.e. owner and producer of an off-off theatre) about the importance of Truth in art. Someone outspoken, new, and young should be looked for.

Beckmann arrives and expresses his ideas. The director tells him he would be better off to change his mind. Nevertheless, the director agrees to give a hearing to his odd visitor.

Beckmann gives a couplet, turning up to be a morose summary of the play up to this point, the melody taken from a popular war time song, &quot;Tapfere kleine Soldatenfrau&quot; (&quot;brave little soldier’s wife&quot;). To the director it is all too dark and foreboding. People in these times want something encouraging, the director says. To Beckmann, that is not Truth. The director replies: &quot;&quot;Truth has nothing to do with art.&quot; Beckmann reproaches him, and leaves the theatre.

Once again, Beckmann takes up an argument with the Other, who gives him the idea to return to his parents. Beckmann expresses some enthusiasm for the first (and only) time in the play.

===Scene five===
Upon arriving at his parents&#x27; house, a woman he has never seen (Frau Kramer) answers the door. He finds out that his parents are to be found in their graves, having killed themselves during the post-war denazification. Beckmann leaves, once again eager to kill himself.

The Other follows him, and the longest dialogue of the play ensues. The nihilistic point of the play comes across during this dialog: There is always suffering in the world; one cannot do anything to change that; the world will not care if you are suffering. As evidence for this, Beckmann outlines a hypothetical play:&lt;br&gt;&quot;1st Act: Grey skies. A man is suffering.&lt;br&gt;2nd Act: Grey skies. The man continues to be pained.&lt;br&gt;3rd Act: It is getting dark and it is raining.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;4th Act: It is darker. The man sees a door.&lt;br&gt;5th Act: It is night, deep night, and the door is closed. The man is standing outside. Outside on the doorstep. The man is standing on a riverside, be it the Elbe, the Seine, the Volga, or the Mississippi. The man stands there crazed, frozen, hungry, and damn tired. And then there is a splash, and the ripples make neat little circles, and then the curtain drops.&quot;

The Other counters that while there is always suffering in the world, there is always hope, and there is always happiness. Dwelling on the suffering cannot accomplish anything; you can make things better by focusing on the good; as he says, &quot;Do you fear the darkness between two lamp-posts?&quot;&quot;

One by one, each of the characters returns to defend himself. Despite their good intentions, they cannot help. Between these visits, the dialog between Beckmann and the Other goes on. There is little change in the content of their arguments; however, both of them become increasingly desperate. Finally, after the girl and her one-legged husband have left, a desperate Beckmann begins a long monologue, at the end of which he demands an answer from the Other; who is fading away. There is no reply, and Beckman realizes he is all alone. Presumably, he has drowned himself.

==Form and Language==
The relatively short play is largely dominated by its protagonist Beckmann, who frequently delivers monologues, including ending the drama in this way. By using colloquial language, Beckmann is portrayed as the average person - &quot;one of those&quot;, as he is introduced in the dramatis personae - who uses military slang expressions such as &quot;crash out&quot;, &quot;drown&quot; and &quot;booze&quot;. The rest of the characters are also vividly shaped by their use of everyday language. Mrs Kramer is characterised through her ordinary vocabulary as part of the petite bourgeois, while the personified Elbe River is a coarse but maternal and tough woman.

Various structural elements serve as recurring literary motifs, with Beckmann&#x27;s dreams and dreamlike elements regularly infiltrating the reality of the plot. A door slamming shut ends each stage of Beckmann&#x27;s journey, after which he finds himself &quot;the man outside&quot;. Beckmann&#x27;s gas mask goggles continually prompt negative reactions and are symbolic of the fact that Beckmann&#x27;s view of the world is still shaped by his wartime experiences. A further core element running through the play is the use of interrogative clauses. Beckmann&#x27;s questions, which he directs to various characters over the course of the play, remain largely unanswered up until he intensifies his questioning in the final climax of the drama: &quot;Will no one at all give an answer? Will no one give an answer??? Will no one, anyone, answer???&quot;

==Historical and Literary Context==
The end of the Second World War has often been described as the &quot;zero hour&quot; () for German literature. The collapse of the old order, as well as German cities lying in ruins, radically changed forms of expression in literature. This was later referred to as Kahlschlagliteratur or Trümmerliteratur, of which Wolfgang Borchert&#x27;s short stories are considered examples.

During the post-war period, the fate of German prisoners of war and Heimkehrer (those released from imprisonment) were central themes in everyday German life, which were also frequently dealt with in contemporary art. &quot;The Man Outside&quot; is one of a large number of similar works based on the theme of soldiers returning home from war.

The vast majority of radio dramas produced in the years following the war with returning soldiers in central roles focused on their private problems. The topic of adultery, for example, was often a central theme, whilst wartime experiences themselves remained largely ignored. The soldier returning home was mostly depicted as an outsider, and through his eyes it was possible to take an alienated view of the present. However, in its critique of post-war society, &quot;The Man Outside&quot; clearly went further than most contemporary plays. In many cases, what the plays had in common was their didactic appeal and great moral gestures, which can also be seen in Beckmann&#x27;s pathos in &quot;The Man Outside&quot;.

==Production history==
The play received its US debut at the President Theatre in New York on March 1, 1949 under the name &quot;Outside the Door&quot;. It was directed by the head of the Dramatic Workshop, German expatriate stage director Erwin Piscator. The &quot;New York Times&quot; critic reacted favorably to the play and its production as did most of his colleagues:

In 1992 Academy Productions presented the play, directed by Andy Lavender at The Green Room, Manchester, (in association with the Manchester International Festival of Expressionism, 16–17 March) and Chelsea Centre Theatre, London, (27 May-13 June).
‘a fringe production of rare subtleties’ (City Limits). Featured in City Limits’ ‘Recommended’ section. Nominated for Best Lighting Design, London Fringe Awards 1992-3.
The music for this production was composed by Simon Rackham and in 2012 was released through cdbaby.

==Adaptation==
In 1949 the play serves as the basis for the film &quot;Love &#x27;47&quot; directed by Wolfgang Liebeneiner.
Die Toten Hosen play from album Ballast der Republik (2012) - Draussen Vor Der Tür.

<text>Montagut is a clothing company located in Saint-Sauveur-de-Montagut in the Auzene Valley, France.
There, in 1880, Pierre Gros&#x27;s great-great-grandfather founded a silk yarn factory. This activity went on from generation to generation. In 1925, Georges Tinland (Pierre&#x27;s grandfather) set up a knitting factory in the same location. Tinland was the first to sell Montagut lingerie and silk stockings. These products were a big commercial success between the two world wars. As early as 1939, Montagut started to work on synthetic fibers and rapidly became an expert in knitting rayon and man-made fibers. In 1952, the Tinland and the Gros families united, and Leo Gros, Pierre&#x27;s father, started modifying the stocking knitting machines to produce sweaters.

In 1962, Leo Gros invented the Fil Lumière, a bright and shiny yarn, strong and elastic. The clothing and polo shirts manufactured with Fil Lumière rapidly became successful in France and abroad.

Today, Montagut is present and well known in many countries for the high quality of its garments. It is particularly well-known in China. Having entered the market since the late 1970s, its presence has grown exponentially to over 3000 boutiques across the country as of 2007.

<doc id="1228762" wikidata="Q5506550" url="?curid=1228762" title="Fry's Island">
<text>Fry&#x27;s Island, also known as De Montfort Island, is an island in the River Thames in England. The island is on the reach above Caversham Lock at Reading, Berkshire. The centre of Reading is to the south and the suburb of Caversham to the immediate north.

Fry&#x27;s Island is a natural island, the only access to it being by boat. It is home to a private house (&quot;Demontfort House&quot;), a boatyard with a residence (&quot;Caversham Boat Services&quot;) and a private bowling club (the &quot;Island Bohemian Club&quot;). Each of these occupants runs their own private ferry service. Administratively, the island forms part of Reading&#x27;s Abbey Ward.

== History ==
Fry&#x27;s Island is famous as the location of a trial by combat between Robert de Montfort and Henry of Essex, the standard bearer to King Henry II. The contest took place while the royal court was in residence at Reading Abbey in 1163. Robert had accused Henry of Essex of cowardice and treason, because he had dropped the royal standard and called out that the King was dead during a battle with the Welsh. Henry of Essex denied these charges. 

King Henry decreed that this dispute must be resolved in a trial by combat, to be undertaken on what is now Fry&#x27;s Island. At the height of the combat, Henry of Essex fell wounded, and believing he was dead the King ordered the monks of the abbey to carry his body away and bury it. However, Henry was still alive, and the monks nursed him back to health. Because he had lost the combat he was adjudged guilty as charged and stripped of his lands and honours; however, he was permitted to become a monk at the abbey, where he remained for the rest of his life.

The first reference to the Island Bohemian Club dates back to 1908, when it held an annual general meeting under the name of the Old Codgers Club. The present name was adopted in 1909, and purchased the freehold of its part of the island in two phases in 1961 and 1968.

Demontfort House was built in 1897. During World War II the house was used as an American Services &#x27;club&#x27;. In the 1960s the house operated as the &#x27;Blue Beat Island Club&#x27;, the club was the subject of a police raid in 1965.

Caversham Boat Services was established in 1970. The residence and large workshop are housed in the former Reading Rowing Club building built in 1893. The adjacent boatyard of Bridge Boats was established in 1958 as a builder of wooden boats, becoming a boat hire business in the 1980s. The business was taken over and merged with Caversham Boat Services in 2009.
