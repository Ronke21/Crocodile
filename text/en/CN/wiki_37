<text>The House of Radziwiłł (; ; ; ) is a Polish princely family of Lithuanian origin, and one of the most powerful magnate families originating from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and later also prominent in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. Part of the representatives of the Radziwiłł family were known for their persistent and consistent struggle for the independence of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and for their crucial role in preserving the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as a separate state in the 16th and 17th centuries.

The family was founded by Radvila Astikas, but over time it split into many branches, such as the Biržai-Dubingiai and Goniądz-Meteliai lines. However, most of the branches became extinct by the 18th century, with only the Nesvizh-Kleck-Ołyka line surviving to this day. Their descendants were highly prominent for centuries, first in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Kingdom of Prussia. The family produced many individuals notable in Lithuanian, Polish, Belarusian, German as well as general European history and culture. Many members of the Radziwiłł family served in high-ranking officers positions of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (e.g. 13 were Voivodes of Vilnius, the capital city, 10 were Castellans of Vilnius, seven were Grand Chancellors of Lithuania, nine were Grand Marshals of Lithuania, seven were Grand Hetmans of Lithuania, etc.). The Radziwiłł family received the title of &quot;Reichsfürst&quot; (prince) from the Holy Roman Emperor in the early 16th-century and were the first nobles in Lithuania and Poland who received this title.

The last patrilineal member of the Radziwiłł family who inhabited in Lithuania was Konstantinas Radvila, an owner of the Taujėnai Manor, however after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940 he was arrested by the NKVD and deported from Lithuania to the Uzbek SSR in 1941 where he died in ~1945.

The Nesvizh Castle complex, maintained by the family between the 16th century and 1939, is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

==Name and origin==

The Radziwiłł family is a directly descended branch of the extinct Lithuanian noble Astikai family line. Its first notable member, Kristinas Astikas (born 1363), a close associate of the Lithuanian ruler Vytautas, became Castellan of Vilnius. The patronym Radvila arose following its use by his son Radvila Astikas and grandson Mikalojus Radvila. A legendary version of the patronym&#x27;s etymology associates it with a child found by &quot;krivis&quot; Lizdeika in a wolf&#x27;s den (&quot;rado vilko...&quot; = &quot;found wolf&#x27;s...&quot;, implying &quot;rado vilko vaikas&quot; = &quot;found wolf&#x27;s child&quot;). 
The Polish forms Radziwiłł or Radźwił (patronymics Radziwiłłowic(z), Radźwiłowic(z)) may come from the originally Belarusian &quot;Radzivil&quot;, i.e. a derivative of il from the base &quot;Radziv-&quot;, derived from a shortened form of the name &quot;Radzivón&quot; (with a v removing the hiatus from the church &quot;Rodi.ón&quot;, similarly to &quot;Larivón&quot; from &quot;Lari.ón&quot; (Ilarión) or &quot;Ljavónt&quot; from (Le.ón), and similarly to &quot;Stanil&quot; from &quot;Stanislav&quot;. They would have been adopted into Lithuanian as &quot;Radzivìlas&quot;, &quot;Radzvilà&quot;.

The family descends from Lithuanian &quot;bajorai-ducal courtiers&quot; who advanced considerably in the 15th-century politics of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Along with possessions of land near Kernavė, the family&#x27;s traced place of origin, the Radziwiłł family also inherited the Trąby coat of arms.

Three of Mikalojus&#x27; sons, Mikołaj, Jan, and Jerzy, went on to become the progenitors of the three known Radziwiłł family lines. His daughter Anna was the great-grandmother of Elizabeth Báthory.

The Radziwiłł family divided by branch:
* the Goniądz - Meteliai line
* the Biržai - Dubingiai line
* the Nieśwież (Nesvizh) – Kleck (Kletsk) – Ołyka line

The Goniądz-Meteliai line became extinct by the next generation as Mikołaj&#x27;s descendants consisted of one male heir, Mikołaj III, who entered the priesthood and became the Bishop of Samogitia, thus bearing no known offspring to extend the line.

The Biržai-Dubingiai line was moderately more successful and produced some very notable state officials and politicians, but it also became extinct after Ludwika Karolina Radziwiłł&#x27;s death in 1695.
The Nesvizh-Kletsk-Olyka line was the most successful and was further divided into smaller family lines to maintain clarity and specificity of descent and the passing of titles. Since the 18th century, all Radziwiłł family members have been descendants of this line. Three sons of Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot;, Mikołaj Krzysztof &quot;the Orphan&quot;, Albrycht, and Stanisław &quot;the Pious&quot;, are said to be the progenitors of the three smaller branches. The branches are as follows:

* the Nesvizh line
* the older Kletsk line
* the Olyka line

Possibly both the Olyka and older Kletsk lines became extinct, the former in 1656 and the latter in 1690. The direct descendant of the Nesvizh line, Dominik Hieronim&#x27;s son, Aleksander Dominik, was born before his parents&#x27; marriage and formed the so-called Galician branch, which went extinct in 1938.

The younger Kletsk line descends from Michał Hieronim, continued through his son Ludwik Mikolaj. The descendants of his other son, Antoni Henryk, formed the beginning of the so-called Ordynant branch. Other than the Ordynant branch, from the younger Kletsk line also descends the lesser titled branches of Szydłowiec and Połoneczka, as well as Dziatłava, Berdychiv, and Żyrmunów. The younger Kletsk line has continued into the present day.

==Coat of arms and motto==

Kristinas Astikas, ancestor of the Radziwiłł family, was among these who were granted and adopted the emblem known as &quot;Trąby&quot; after the Union of Horodło in 1413. This emblem later became the hereditary coat of arms of the Radziwiłłs.

In 1518, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I created Mikalojus Radvila&#x27;s son, Mikołaj, &quot;Reichsfürst&quot; (&quot;Imperial Prince&quot;) of Goniądz and Meteliai after the Jagiellonian-Habsburg congress at Vienna. Mikołaj Radziwiłł also received an expanded, more solemn coat of arms: as princes of the Holy Roman Empire, the Radziwiłłs bore a black eagle, on whose breast is a shield with &quot;Trąby&quot; and other emblems. The family motto is &quot;God advises us&quot; (Polish: &quot;Bóg nam radzi&quot;, Belarusian: &quot;Бог нам раіць&quot;, &quot;Boh nam rajić&quot;).

In 1547, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, created Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; and his brother, Jan, hereditary &quot;Reichsfürsten&quot; of Nesvizh and Olyka; their cousin Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot; Radziwiłł was created &quot;Reichsfürst&quot; of Biržai and Dubingiai. The same year King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland married Barbara Radziwiłł and confirmed these titles in 1549. So high a title was rare among the &quot;szlachta&quot; (the Polish nobility): just five Polish families, including the Radziwiłłs, received the title of imperial prince from the Holy Roman emperor.

==Religion==

The Radziwiłł family also divided on religious grounds. Following the Protestant and Polish Reformation, two branches converted to Calvinism. Some members of the Nesvizh–Kletsk-Olyka branch of family remained as Calvinists for two generations until the children of Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; converted to Roman Catholicism before the end of the century. The Biržai-Dubingiai line remained in the Protestant faith until the extinction of their line one century later.

Queen Barbara Radziwiłł, sister of Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot; and first cousin of Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot;, was practicing catholic and hence, despite controversy surrounding her secret wedding with the King, she was recognized by popes Paul III and Julius III as legitimate royal wife and Queen of Poland. Nevertheless, Barbara apparently was tolerant towards different nominations, as she is not known to be conflicted with her brother or non-catholic members of her royal court because of their religious nomination.

Both Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; and Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot; were zealous promoters and active participants of the Protestant religion within the GDL. Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; funded the printing of a second version, and first completed, Polish translation of a Protestant Bible, titled the &quot;Radziwiłł Bible&quot; (also known as &quot;Biblia Brzeska&quot;), which was published in the town of Brest in 1564. His death in 1565 was seen as a severe loss to the Protestant cause in Lithuania. However, Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot; continued his cousin&#x27;s work by founding and endowing land to several churches and schools.

==Politics==
Several prominent family members have been involved in domestic and foreign political arenas. They took an active part in the political life of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Its importance is manifested by family relations with such famous nobility dynasties in Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, the Great Duchy of Lithuania, Samogitia, and Rus like Zaslawski, Rohatinski, Lukomski, and Olshanski-Dobrowicki. The Radziwiłł family joined the rest of the nobility as the state&#x27;s elite after the signing of the Union of Krewo in 1385.

The significance of the Radziwiłł family is proved by the marriage of Anna to Konrad III Rudy, duke of Masovia, who owned the largest Polish principality.

In 1547 Barbara Radziwiłł was married in secret to Sigismund II Augustus, thus legally becoming royal consort; she was officially proclaimed Queen of Poland and Grand Duchess of Lithuania the next year. Although the marriage caused scandal within the country as it was performed without informing Polish nobles, the royal couple was supported by Papal Curia, as well by the Radziwiłł family&#x27;s ally and the King&#x27;s former father-in-law, Ferdinand Habsburg. Barbara was crowned in 1550. Some Polish nobles opposed the idea of Sigismund and Barbara&#x27;s child inheriting the Polish throne in the future, because of disdain towards the Radziwiłł&#x27;s family further elevation, however Barbara probably miscarried twice during her marriage with the king, and died in 1551 without having surviving children.

Later the Radziwiłłs established family relations not only with the most important families of the Polish, Belarusian and Lithuanian magnate families like Sanguszko, Sapieha or Chodkiewicz, but also with members of royal families like Wiśniowiecki, Sobieski, and Leszczyński.

The political position of the Radziwiłłs was enhanced in the 16th century. In 1515, Mikołaj, as a member of a delegation, headed by King Sigismund I the Old took part in the First Congress of Vienna in Pressburg and Vienna where Emperor Maximilian I met kings of Poland, Hungary and Bohemia. Additionally, Mikolaj &quot;the Black&quot; was the deputy to the Grand Prince when the latter was abroad. From that time on, the Radziwiłłs were also granted the privilege of keeping legal acts and other state documents in Nesvizh.

In 1583 bishop Jerzy Radziwiłł was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope Gregory XIII, established a closer relationship with the influential noble banking families Altoviti and Strozzi. Later prince Aleksander Ludwik Radziwiłł married Lucrezia Maria Strozzi, great-granddaughter of Bindo Altoviti and Filippo Strozzi.

During this time until the first half of the 17th century, the Radziwiłłs were the most influential and richest family among the magnate dynasties of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. This status enabled them, along with very few other families, to have their own army. In 1528, the Radziwiłłs owned 18,240 houses, thus being able to have cavalry of 760 horsemen. In 1567, 28,170 houses provided for an expanded 939 horsemen and 1586 infantrymen. In the 18th century, the army of Hieronim Florian, for instance, had 6,000 men and was equal to the entire armed forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

Members of the Radziwiłł family held important state posts in the &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. 8 chancellors, 7 &quot;hetmans&quot;, 15 &quot;castellans&quot;, 19 &quot;marszałeks&quot;, and 19 &quot;voivodes&quot;, almost exclusively representing the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, rather than the Crown, belonged to the dynasty. Radziwiłłs were members of the parliament and of the Tribunal of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. They also held high military posts and took part in the Livonian War, Russo-Polish War of 1647–1667, Northern Wars, participated in the Napoleonic campaign, and the Kościuszko Uprising. Part of the representatives of the Radziwiłł family were known for their persistent and consistent struggle for the independence of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and represented the Grand Duke of Lithuania when he was absent from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. According to duke Maciej Radziwiłł, the Radziwiłł family&#x27;s role was crucial in preserving the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as a separate state in the 16th and 17th centuries. Contemporaries of the 16th century were saying about the Radziwiłł family that &quot;Lithuania is recognized by this name&quot;.
The Radziwiłłs also gained international importance manifested in family relations with German princely dynasties, first established by Albrecht Radziwiłł from Olyka, who married Anna, princess of Courland. Such conjugal unions continued in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł (1734–1790) of the Nieśwież line was the wealthiest magnate in Poland, in the second half of the 18th century, and one of the richest men in Europe. As a patriot, he fought for a free nation that soon after his death would be partitioned between Austria, Prussia and the Russian Empire. During the Great Sejm from 1788 until he died in 1790, he was a leading opponent of reform and King Stanisław II Augustus and his allies, the members of the so-called &quot;Familia&quot; political party headed by the Czartoryski family.

After the three partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century, towns and estates owned by the Radziwiłłs became parts of territories that belonged to Russia, Prussia and Austria. However, all three states recognized the title of princes of the Radziwiłł dynasty and the rights of its members at the family properties. In addition, many members of the Radziwiłł family held high civil and military posts.
They had family ties with the Dukes of Castellane, the Clary-Aldringen and Sayn-Wittgenstein princes and most importantly with Frederick William II, King of Prussia and his son Frederick William III. Prince Antoni Radziwiłł of the Kletsk line married Princess Louise of Prussia, a daughter of Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia and hence a first cousin of King Frederick William II. This relation helped Antoni to release the vast properties of Nieśwież and Olyka from Russian seizure in 1815, after his cousin, Dominik of the Nieśwież line had fought and died on Napoleons&#x27; side in the Polish Legion, and Alexander I of Russia had therefore confiscated his whole property. After the Congress of Vienna, the inheritance was partially given to Antoni.

The couple were prominent patrons of the arts in Berlin during the early 19th century. At their Berlin residence, the Radziwiłł Palace, they hosted well-known personalities, artists and academics, playing a major role in promoting the Prussian-Polish relationship in Berlin. These included Polish politicians in the Prussian Parliament or such famous people as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Frédéric Chopin, Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt, Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy and Karl Friedrich Schinkel. In fact, the &quot;Salons&quot; held by the Radziwiłłs were so popular that they became a symbol of &quot;Polish Berlin&quot;. Prince Ferdynand Radziwiłł - like Wilhelm von Humboldt, Goethe, Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy and many further notable personalities - also was a member of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin where people from all walks of life and classes in Berlin came together to study and practice choral music. Although most of their largest estates were located in Russian Poland, the close relation with the Royal House of Prussia caused the family to preferably live at the Berlin court, using their influence, than in Warsaw or St. Petersburg, given their experience with the Czar&#x27;s seizure of most of the family&#x27;s property in 1813. Moreover, Michał Gedeon Radziwiłł was the commander-in-chief of the November uprising of 1830–31.

Elisa Radziwill, a daughter of Antoni and Louise, became the first love of the later Prussian King and German Emperor Wilhelm I. Her brothers Wilhelm (1797–1870) and Bogusław (1809–1873) became Prussian generals and politicians, the latter being an influential opponent of Prussian minister-president (and, from 1871, German Chancellor) Otto von Bismarck in his anti-Catholic politics, later called the Kulturkampf. Bogusław&#x27;s son Ferdynand (1834–1926) also became an important leader of the Polish minority and opponent of the Germanization and Kulturkampf policies. After Poland regained independence in 1918, he became a Polish citizen and a member of the Polish parliament (Sejm), and so did his son Janusz (1880–1967). Their cousin Stanislaw Radziwiłł was the &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to the Commander-in-chief Józef Piłsudski. In German-occupied Poland, Janusz tried to use his prestige to improve Nazi treatment of the Poles – unlike his brother Michał who sided with the Nazis, at least at the beginning of the occupation. After the Second World War in 1945, Janusz was arrested by NKVD, and his wife would die in a communist prison in 1947. Janusz died in his two-room apartment in Warsaw, with all of his possessions confiscated and nationalized by the communist government.

In 1959, Janusz&#x27;s third son prince Stanisław Albrecht Radziwiłł married Caroline Bouvier, the younger sister of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.

== Art patronage ==
Prince Antoni Radziwiłł was a music and art aficionado and he transformed his properties in Berlin to serve as artistic salons, where aristocrats mingled among artists, painters and composers. Radziwiłł&#x27;s Berlin properties hosted frequent amateur theatre play productions.

Another property Antoni Radziwiłł owned in Prussian-Poland was Antonin, a hunting lodge he had built between 1822 and 1824 by the German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, named after him. Later in his life, Antoni Radziwiłł moved permanently to Antonin with his wife, Louise of Prussia, and two daughters Wanda and Eliza. Antoni Radziwiłł was a well-connected composer among European musical circles and with time transformed the Antonin property into a popular musical salon among greatest talents of the area such as Niccolò Paganini, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Frédéric Chopin and Ludwig van Beethoven. Chopin gave music lessons to Antoni Radziwiłł&#x27;s daughter Wanda during his stays at the property. During his stays with Radziwiłł family, Chopin also had composed the Polonaise op.3 and Piano Trio Op. 8 and dedicated the latter to Radziwiłł. Antoni Radziwiłł also supported some of the artists financially, among them Fryderyk Chopin. Chopin&#x27;s visits to Antonin property were documented by Henryk Siemiradzki in a photogravure titled &quot;Chopin u księcia Radziwiłła&quot; (&quot;Chopin&#x27;s visit to Prince Radziwill&quot;).

==Wealth==

The family acquired and maintained great wealth and influence from the 15th–16th century until 1939, when the Second World War started. The Radziwiłł family reached the heights of its importance and power during the Polish Golden Age. However, due to the activities of Janusz Radziwiłł during The Deluge, a series of mid-17th-century campaigns in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the family lost much of its wealth and power.

Regarding their wealth, the Radziwiłłs were not inferior to a royal family. In total, the Radziwiłł family has, over the centuries, had in its possession 23 palaces, 426 large and small towns, 2032 estates, and 10,053 villages. In present-day Belarus they possessed towns and boroughs like Haranyony, Davyd-Haradok, Kletsk, Dzyarzhynsk, Kopys, Dakhva, Mir, Nesvizh, Charnauchitsy, and Shchuchyn; in present-day Ukraine: Olyka with dozens of villages in the Wolyn province (Polish: wojewodztwo); in present-day Poland: Szydłowiec with villages in the Sandomierz province and Nieborów; and in present-day Lithuania: Biržai, Dubingiai, Kėdainiai, and others.
The Goniądz-Meteliai line possessed, during the 15th – 16th centuries, estates like Goniądz, Zaigrad and Podlaskie Lowlands in Poland. In 1612 the Principality of Slutsk with some thirty-two villages passed over to the Radziwiłłs, after Janusz Radziwiłł had married the heiress Zofia Olelkowicz Słucka. Radziwiłłs also expanded their possessions with Brest, Ashmyany, Krychau, Lida, Mazyr and other administrative territories (starostwos). As a result, the Radziwiłłs were granted a lifetime privilege of being governors (starostas) of those territories. However, during Janusz Radziwiłł&#x27;s lifetime, the interests between his family and the Polish Crown began to drift apart, as the Radziwiłłs sought to increase their wealth and power, safeguard Protestantism and support ethnically Lithuanian culture, which caused him to join the opposition against King Sigismund III Vasa in 1606.

In 1586, the sons of Mikolaj &quot;the Black&quot; arranged for their fortunes to follow an &quot;ordynacja&quot; (fee tail), which was to have individual properties inherited by their male descendants; see &quot;Radziwiłł Family Fee Tail&quot;. The ordynats of Nesvizh, Kletsk, and Olyka were thus formed. In the 19th century the Davyd-Haradok and Przygodzice ordynats were also established. Other possessions could be inherited by female heirs or alienated. Depending on the importance and size of owned lands, they were called either principalities (Nesvizh, Olyka, Biržai, Dubingiai, Kapyl, Slutsk, Staryi Chortoryisk, Stary Zbaraz, Goniądz and Medele), counties (Mir, Biała Podlaska, Dzyarzhynsk, Kopys, Zabłudów, Kėdainiai, Zolkow, Pomorzani, Belykamen, Kražiai), or estates (Nevel, Krasnoye, Sebezh, Musninkai, Sereya, Horodok, Sobolew, Slovatichi, Ruchai, Kolki, Vyazyn, Rafałówka, Zhmigrod, Beloozero, Yampol, Shumsk, Sverzhen, Drisvyaty, Naliboki). The family ties to the banking dynasties Altoviti and Strozzi played an important role to secure titles and wealth with the Roman Curia.

After the extinction of the Olyka and older Kletsk lines, their fortunes were passed to those of the Nesvizh line. With the death of the heirless Dominik Hieronim in 1813, the Nesvizh line lost its right to the ordynat. Dominik Heronim&#x27;s son, Aleksander Dominik, was born before his parents&#x27; marriage and was thus denied the title and inheritance of his forefathers. He and his descendants had their princely title confirmed by the Austrian Empire. Thus, the ordynat of Nesvizh and Olyka fell into the hands of the younger Kletsk line. This, however, cost the new owner, Antoni Radziwiłł, some diplomatic effort at the Congress of Vienna, as his cousin Dominik had fought in the Polish Legion on Napoleons&#x27; side, and Alexander I of Russia had therefore confiscated his whole property. Only because of Prussia&#x27;s intervention (since Antoni was married to a Prussian princess) he was able to keep the family trust properties, mainly Nesvizh Castle and Olyka Castle with vast lands, while Mir Castle and 18,000 km2 of land passed to Dominik&#x27;s only legitimate child, Stephania, who had to marry a Russian subject, according to the Czar&#x27;s order, whom she found in Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg.

In this way, all three Radziwiłł ordynats ended up in the possession of one line, represented by the sons of Michal Hieronim, Ludwik Mikolaj of Kletsk and Antoni Henryk of Nesvizh and Olyka. The descendants of Antoni Henryk formed the beginning of the so-called Ordynant branch, out of the younger Kletsk line, in whose possession, other than the three older ordynats of Nesvizh, Kletsk, and Olyka, they also received the two additional titles of Przygodzice and Davyd-Haradok.

The Radziwiłł family owned 23 castles and palaces. The most fortified of them were in Nesvizh, Olyka, Biržai, Biała, Slutsk, Zolkow, Pomorzany and Zolochiv. The Radziwiłłs possessed palaces in most important cities of the Rzeczpospolita, including those where the Sejm, had its sessions (Warsaw, Hrodna), or the Tribunal held its meetings (Vilnius, Lublin, Navahrudak), in province centres where the Radziwiłłs had their estates (Minsk and Lviv), and in the cities where the Radziwiłłs were economically active (Gdańsk, Wrocław). In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Radziwiłłs also owned property in European capitals like Vienna, Dresden, Berlin and Paris. Residences that emerged in the centres of the possessions of the Radziwiłłs reflected the importance of a town in the history of the family. One of these types of residences was Nesvizh in present-day Belarus, which by the 18th century had developed into a most important princely town.

==Residences==
Over the generations the family members have resided in some notable historic homes. The Radziwiłł family owned a total of 23 palaces. Some of the more prominent of these are:

* Nesvizh Castle – The property Nieśwież in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (nowadays located in Belarus) was owned by the Radziwiłł family from 1533, when it was awarded to Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; and his brother Jan after the extinction of the Kiszka family. The Lithuanian Archives were moved into the castle in 1551. In 1582, Mikołaj Krzysztof &quot;the Orphan&quot; began construction of a chateau based on the pre-existing structure of the medieval castle, which itself was turned into a renaissance-baroque house. Construction was completed by 1604, and several galleries were added half a century later. In 1706, during the Great Northern War, the castle was sacked, and the Swedish destroyed its fortifications. Several decades later, the Radziwiłłs substantially renovated and enlarged the chateau. In 1770, the castle was seized by Russian forces and the family was expelled. Soon afterwards, the Lithuanian Archives was transferred to Saint Petersburg, while most works of art gathered in the palace were distributed among various Russian nobles. It was again confiscated in 1813 when Dominik Radziwiłł had fought against the Czar on Napoleon&#x27;s side. Antoni Radziwiłł, belonging to a different branch of the family, was able to get it restituted at the Congress of Vienna. However, he and his family living in Berlin and Prussian-Poland, the remote palace fell into disrepair. Between 1881 and 1886, Antoni Henryk renovated the castle&#x27;s interiors, being pushed by his French wife, Marie de Castellane. They also designed a landscape park in the English style. In 1939, the Radziwiłł family was again expelled from the castle by the Russians, this time by the invading Red Army during its invasion of Poland. The Corpus Christi Church, built on the premises, contains the coffins of 72 family members, each interred in a simple coffin made of birch and marked with the Trąby Coat of Arms.
* Olyka Castle – A principal seat of the Nesvizh-Kletsk-Olyka line, its construction was initiated by Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; and inherited by his son, Stanisław &quot;the Pious&quot;. It was expanded in the 18th century. However, due to Dominik Hieronim&#x27;s involvement in the Napoleonic army, the Russian government confiscated the castle from the family, together with Nieśwież. Antoni Radziwiłł received it in 1815. In the late 19th century, it was also renovated by his grandchildren.
* Mir Castle Complex – A Gothic style castle that passed into the hands of Mikołaj Krzysztof &quot;the Orphan&quot; in 1568, it was finished in the Renaissance style. The Swedes destroyed the complex in 1655 and 1706. After being rebuilt, Karol Stanisław &quot;Panie Kochanku&quot; took up residence. The castle suffered severe damage during the Napoleonic period and was uninhabited for nearly a century before being restored again at the end of the 19th century. In 1813, after the death of Dominik Hieronim, the castle and its enormous estates were inherited by his daughter, Stefania, who married Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. The castle then passed to her daughter Mary Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn, wife of German chancellor Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, who was forced to sell it as a foreigner, according to newly introduced law, at the end of the 19th century.
* Biržai Castle – The construction of this earth bastion-type castle was ordered by Krzysztof Mikołaj &quot;Perkūnas&quot; Radziwiłł in 1586 and was completed in 1589. The castle became the main seat of the Biržai-Dubingiai line after it was moved from Dubingiai during the second half of the 17th century. During the Polish–Swedish wars in 1625, the castle was destroyed and surrendered. The family regained the castle in 1626 and rebuilt it from 1662 to 1669 in the Renaissance style. In the following war with Sweden in 1704, the castle and its fortifications were destroyed again and abandoned. At the beginning of the 19th century, the castle was sold to the Tyszkiewicz family.
* Radziwiłł Palace in Warsaw – Purchased from the Lubomirski family in 1674 by Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł, the Nesvizh-Kletsk-Olyka line held the palace in its possession for 144 years until Dominik Hieronim died heirless in 1813. It was purchased in 1818 by the government of Congress Poland. It is the official seat of the President of the Republic of Poland.
* Nieborów Palace – Built between 1690 and 1696 on the site of an older castle, the palace came into the ownership of Michał Hieronim Radziwiłł in the late 18th century. He had its interior furnished with rococo and early classicist ornaments designed by Szymon Bogumił Zug. The next owner was his son Antoni Radziwiłł. During the ownership of Janusz Radziwiłł (1880–1967), the palace became a meeting place for many eminences in the interwar period, and during the German occupation in World War II, a meeting point for the Home Army, a Polish resistance movement. After the war, the estate was expropriated by the Polish state and became subsidiaries of the National Museum in Warsaw.
* Dubingiai Castle – A masonry castle acquired in 1508 by Jerzy and later reconstructed by the family in the Renaissance style, it was the main seat of the Biržai-Dubingiai line until the second half of the 17th century. After the death of Jerzy, his son Mikolaj &quot;the Red&quot; inherited the property, causing the town nearby to become an important hub for the Reformation in Lithuania. During the Polish-Swedish wars, the castle was pillaged by armies loyal to the King of Poland and was confiscated from Bogusław. It returned to the family in the second half of the 17th century. Before 1620, a mausoleum was additionally built near the castle by Janusz I. The remains of several family members, including Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot;, his wife Elżbieta Szydłowiecka, Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot;, and those of its creator, Janusz I, were recently found to be interred there. The neglected castle and church gradually fell into ruins, which were sold to Michał Tyszkiewicz in 1808.
* Lubcha Castle – A fortified residence that passed into the hands of Janusz II, it was expanded to have an additional three stone towers. In 1655, it was seized and devastated by Cossacks under the command of Ivan Zolotarenko during the Russo-Polish war. It was then passed to another set of owners.
* Radziwiłł Palace in Vilnius – Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot;&#x27;s wooden Vilnius mansion was likely on the same site. Still, the current building was constructed by order of Janusz from 1635 until 1653. During the various wars in the late 17th century, the palace was unoccupied. In 1807, Dominik Hieronim donated the property to the Philanthropist Society. It was further devastated during World War I, and only the northern wing of the palace survived. Today, a division of the Lithuanian Art Museum is located there, on Vilniaus Str. 22. In one hall, one can see 165 portraits of the Radziwiłł family. These engravings were commissioned by Michał Kazimierz &quot;Rybeńko&quot; and carried out by artist H. Leybowisc.
* Pac-Radziwiłł Palace – The palace was constructed for Dominik Mikołaj at the end of the 17th century. It was the property of the Radziwiłł family to the beginning of the 19th century, with breaks in ownership from 1744 to 1759 and 1762 to 1775. Around 1757, offices were built. During the Warsaw Uprising of 1794, it was partially destroyed. During the Prussian occupation from 1807 to 1809, the unoccupied building hosted a theatre, later becoming an army bunker and a lazaretto. It was bought by Ludwik Michał Pac in 1825. It is located on ul. Miodowa No. 15 and currently houses the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Poland.

* Radziwiłł Palace in Berlin – A city palace located on Wilhelmstrasse No. 77. The palace, built in 1738, was purchased by Antoni Radziwiłł after his marriage with Princess Louise of Prussia. The Palais Radziwiłł played hosts to regular visits from well-known personalities, artists and academics, playing a major role in promoting Prussian-Polish relationships in Berlin. In addition, the Palais Radziwiłł was a meeting point for Polish politicians in the Prussian Parliament where they could exchange ideas and opinions on how to solve the long-standing question of what to do about Poland. In 1869 the palace was acquired by the Prussian state government from Antoni Henryk. It was turned into the old Reich Chancellery for Otto von Bismarck. In 1933 Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany and moved into the Palace. He used the Palace as a private residence after his adjacent New Reich Chancellery was completed in Voßstrasse. When the Red Army invaded Berlin in 1945, the palace was so heavily damaged that it had to be demolished in 1949, as was the New Chancellery. Hitler had shot himself dead in its bunker.

<text>Yunus (, ; Arabic synonym of &quot;Jonas&quot; or &quot;Jonah&quot;), is the 10th chapter (surah) of the Quran with 109 verses (&quot;ayat&quot;). Yunus is named after the prophet Yunus (Jonah). According to tafsir chronology (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is believed to have been revealed before the migration of the Islamic prophet Muhammed and his followers from Mecca to Medina (Hijra), as such, it is known as a Meccan surah.

Surah Yunus is the first of six surahs which open with the tri-letters alif, lam and ra&#x27;.

The chapter presents the Meccan pagans&#x27; objections against the Quran, and responds to them. The pagans said that Muhammad was a &quot;manifest sorcerer&quot; and that he fabricated the Quran. They also challenged Muhammad to immediately bring the punishment of God, if his claim was true. They also demanded that Muhammad change the Quran to no longer condemn their practice of idolatry and using intercessors when worshipping God.

The chapter&#x27;s response to these objection is a mix of &quot;argument, threat, promise and reproach&quot;. It defends the Quran&#x27;s divine origin, not a fabrication of Muhammad&#x27;s, and says that Muhammad could not change it even if he wanted to. As for the challenge to bring God&#x27;s punishment, the chapter says that God may defer punishment in this world if he wants to. It also tells of the punishment against unbelievers in the past, such as the people of Noah and Moses. It says that if the pagans waited for the punishment before believing, it would be too late, as was the case with the Pharaoh of Moses. According to the Quran, the Pharaoh only believed in God just before drowning, and that belief was too late and did not benefit him.

The chapter also mentions the People of Jonah, who at first rejected Jonah&#x27;s message, but then repented and believed. Therefore, unlike the people of Noah and Moses, they were averted from God&#x27;s punishment. The mention of Jonah in verse 98 gives the chapter its name. The chapter then instructs Muhammad if he had any doubt about the truth of what was revealed to him, he could ask other People of the Book (i.e. the Jews and the Christians) who would be able to confirm the Quran&#x27;s account of these people of the past.

==Revelation==
According to the Islamic tradition, the chapter is predominantly revealed during the Meccan phase (610–622) of Muhammad&#x27;s prophethood (before his move to Medina), therefore, a Meccan sura. Based on its context, some verses appeared to date to when Muhammad just started his call to Islam. According to the fifteenth century commentary &quot;Tafsir al-Jalalayn&quot;, some said that the surah was revealed sometime after Muhammad&#x27;s Night Journey (c. 621). Verses 40 and 94–96 appeared to be an exception and were revealed in Medina. The congruity of the topic unmistakably shows this doesn&#x27;t contain separated sections or talks that were uncovered at various occasions or on various events. Actually, it is, from the starting point to end, a firmly associated talk which more likely than not been uncovered at one sitting. Other than this, the nature of its subject is itself a reasonable confirmation that the Surah has a place with the Makkan time frame.

We have no tradition as to the hour of its disclosure, yet its topic gives a clear sign that it probably been uncovered during the last phase of Muhammad&#x27;s living at Makkah. For the method of the talk recommends that at the hour of its disclosure, the hostility of the rivals of the Message had become so exceptional that they couldn&#x27;t endure even the nearness of Muhammad and his supporters among themselves, and that left no expectation that they could ever comprehend and acknowledge the message of Muhammad. This shows the last admonition like in this surah had to be given. These attributes of the talk are clear confirmation that it was uncovered during the last phase of the movement at Makkah.

Something else that decides all the more explicitly for the Surahs of the last stage at Makkah is the notice (or nonattendance) of some open or incognito insight about Hijrat (Emigration) from Makkah. As this Surah doesn&#x27;t contain any clue at about this, it is a proof that it was revealed before those surahs which contain it.

==Name==
The chapter is named after Jonah who was known as &quot;Yunus&quot; in the Islamic tradition, who is mentioned in the verse 98. Despite the chapter being named after him, this verse is the only one (out of 109) where the chapter mentions him. This is not unusual in the Quran, a chapter&#x27;s name is usually taken from a prominent or unusual word in it, which might or might not relate to its subject matter.

==Principal subjects==
The first ayat contains greeting towards the Right Way is reached out to the individuals who were thinking about it a strange thing that Allah&#x27;s message was being presented on by a person (Muhammad). They were accusing Muhammad of witchcraft, though there is neither anything strange in it nor makes them anything to do with magic or soothsaying. Muhammad is just educated humanity these two realities:

* Allah, Who has made the universe, is, indeed, your Rabb, and He Alone is qualified for be worshipped.
* That after the life right now, will be another life in the following scene, where you will need to render full record of this current world&#x27;s life. You will be compensated or rebuffed by whether you adopt the righteous attitude required by Allah in the wake of recognizing Him as your Rabb, or act against His commandments.

Both of these realities will be real factors in themselves, regardless of whether you recognize them in that capacity or not. On the off chance that you acknowledge these, you will have an extremely honored end; else you will meet the shrewd outcomes of your offenses. The significant issues, divine laws, and instructions in the surah can be listed as follows:-

# Allah is the only Creator of this universe.
# Deities worshiped by mushrikin, other than Allah, have no capacity to either profit or mischief anybody.
# Deities other than Allah are not in any case mindful that they are being worshiped.
# Allah sent a Rasool for guidance to each nation.
# Al-Qur&#x27;an gives a fix to all the issues of humankind.
# Mushrikin follow only guesses and
# The tale of the Prophet Nuh and his kin.
# The tale of the Prophet Musa, Fir&#x27;on, and his chiefs.
# Believing in the wake of seeing the scourge didn&#x27;t profit any nation aside from the people of the Prophet Yunus.
# Forbiddance against compelling anybody to change over to Islam.

==Exegesis==
===Verse 10:25===
The ideal society according to the Quran is Dar as-Salam, literally, &quot;the house of peace&quot; of which it intones: &quot;And Allah invites to the &#x27;abode of peace&#x27; and guides whom He pleases into the right path.&quot;

===Verse 10:101===
It is narrated that when Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq was asked about verse [10:101]: ...the signs and warnings are of no avail to the disbelieving people, he replied the signs are the Imams and the warnings are the Prophets.

==Placement and coherence with other surahs==
The idea of textual relation between the verses of a chapter has been discussed under various titles such as &quot;nazm&quot; and &quot;munasabah&quot; in non-English literature and &quot;coherence&quot;, &quot;text relations&quot;, &quot;intertextuality&quot;, and &quot;unity&quot; in English literature. Hamiduddin Farahi, an Islamic scholar of the Indian subcontinent, is known for his work on the concept of nazm, or coherence, in the Quran. Fakhruddin al-Razi (died 1209 CE), Zarkashi (died 1392) and several other classical as well as contemporary Quranic scholars have contributed to the studies. The entire Qur&#x27;an thus emerges as a well-connected and systematic book. Each division has a distinct theme. Topics within a division are more or less in the order of revelation. Within each division, each member of the pair complements the other in various ways. The seven divisions are as follows:

<doc id="1241624" wikidata="Q5928837" url="?curid=1241624" title="Hudson River Chains">
<text>The Hudson River Chains were a series of chain booms constructed across the Hudson River at West Point by Continental Army forces from 1776 to 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. These served as defenses preventing British naval vessels from sailing upriver and were overseen by the Highlands Department of the Continental Army.

The first chain was destroyed by British forces in the aftermath of the Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery in October 1777. The more significant and successful was the Great Chain, constructed in 1778 and used through war&#x27;s end in 1782. Two other barriers across the river, referred to as &quot;chevaux-de-frise&quot;, were undertaken by the Colonials; the first, between Fort Washington on the island of Manhattan, and Fort Lee in New Jersey, was completed in 1776 and shortly seized by the British; another was started in 1776 between Plum Point on the east bank and Pollepel Island north of West Point but abandoned in 1777 in favor of completion of the Great Chain nearby the following year.

==Background==
Even before the April 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts, both the Americans and British knew that passage on the Hudson River was strategically important to each sides’ war effort. The Americans were desperate to control the river, lest New England be divided from the rest of the colonies. The immediate American plan was to slow or block ship traffic on the river by attacking British vessels with cannon and mortars from both shores. This anticipated batteries at both existing and planned defensive fortifications. In late 1776 Henry Wisner, a resident of Goshen, New York, and one of New York&#x27;s representatives to the Continental Congress, along with Gilbert Livingston, sounded the Hudson River and, as part of a Secret Committee of the &quot;Committee of Safety,&quot; recommended the placement of chains in strategic locations along the Hudson.

Colonial forces eventually constructed three obstacles across the river: a &quot;chevaux-de-frise&quot; at northern Manhattan between Forts Washington and Lee in 1776; at the lower entrance to the Hudson Highlands, from newly constructed Fort Montgomery on the west bank at Popolopen Creek just north of the modern-day Bear Mountain Bridge to Anthony&#x27;s Nose on the east bank in 1776–1777; and between West Point and Constitution Island in 1778, known as the Great Chain. A fourth, a cheval-de-frise started in 1776 between Plum Point on the east bank and Pollepel Island north of West Point, was begun but abandoned. The first two were promptly captured by the British, while the Great Chain, the largest and most important of the projects, was reset each spring until the end of the war. Attention was concentrated on the West Point area because the river narrowed and curved so sharply there that ships slowed in navigating the passage by shifting winds, tides, and current made optimal targets.

==Fort Lee to Fort Washington chevaux-de-frise (1776)==
In 1776 the Continental Army constructed an array of logs sunk underwater between Fort Washington on the island of Manhattan and Fort Lee across the river in New Jersey. Built to a design of Scottish engineer turned Colonial sympathizer Robert Erskine, the logs were intended to pierce and sink any British ships that passed over them. An opening was left for the passage of American ships.

After the British learned of the opening from a local resident, they successfully passed through the barrier several times. The British successfully captured both forts in the Battle of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776, and Battle of Fort Lee on November 20, putting the defensive barrier in their hands. This change had little impact, as the nascent Continental Navy lacked ships of the size and power of the British, leaving it to resort to small and more maneuverable vessels regardless.

==Fort Montgomery chain (1776–1777)==
In 1776 a chain and boom were stretched across the river from Fort Montgomery on the west bank, at the lower entrance to the Highlands just north of the modern-day Bear Mountain Bridge, to Anthony&#x27;s Nose on the east bank. Captain Thomas Machin headed the chain effort. In November 1776, a faulty link broke under stress induced by the river current, highlighting some of the difficulties of trying to chain the Hudson. It was repaired and reset.

After the British captured forts Montgomery and Clinton, a second fortress built opposite it at the mouth of Popolopen&#x27;s Kill (today&#x27;s Popolopen Creek) on its south bank, on 6 October 6, 1777, they dismantled the chain. Free to do so, they raided upriver as far as Kingston, then the capitol of New York State, putting the torch to it and burning all but several of its hundreds of buildings to the ground.

Governor George Clinton, a member of the committee assigned by the New York Convention to devise a means of defending the Hudson, was heartened as the British had never attempted to run ships through the chain. He concluded that the basic idea of obstructing the river seemed sound. After Captain Machin recovered from wounds from battle with the British, he began work on the stronger Great Chain at West Point, which was constructed and installed in 1778.

==Pollepel Island chevaux-de-frise (1776–1777)==
Another cheval-de-frise was undertaken across the Hudson between Plum Point on the east bank and Pollepel Island north of West Point. The defenses were never fully completed, and its importance was overshadowed by completion of the Great Chain at West Point the following year.

== (1778–1782)==

In the spring of 1778, a heavy chain supported by huge log rafts was stretched across the Hudson from West Point to Constitution Island to impede the movement of British ships north of West Point. A second log boom (resembling a ladder in construction) spanned the river about downstream to absorb the impact of any ship attempting to breach the barrier.

The Hudson River&#x27;s changing tides, strong current, and frequently unfavorable winds created adverse sailing conditions at West Point. Compounding this, the river&#x27;s narrow width and sharp &quot;S-Curve&quot; there forced any large ship to tack in order to navigate it. Cannon were placed in forts and artillery batteries on both sides of the river to attack ships when they were slowed to a halt by the Patriot barrier placed there.

The chain was constructed over six weeks at the Sterling Iron Works in Warwick, Orange County, of chain links from Long Pond Iron Works in Ringwood, New Jersey. When completed, the chain contained iron links in length, weighing . The links were carted to New Windsor, where they were put together and floated down the river to West Point on logs late in April.

Including swivels, clevises, and anchors, the chain weighed 65 tons. For buoyancy, logs were cut into lengths, waterproofed, and joined by fours into rafts fastened to one another with timbers. Short sections of chain (10 links, a swivel, and a clevis) were attached across each raft then joined to create a continuous boom of chains and rafts once afloat.

Captain Thomas Machin, the artillery officer and engineer who had installed the chain at Fort Montgomery, directed installation across the river on 30 April 1778. Both ends were anchored to log cribs filled with rocks, the southern at a small cove on the west bank and the northern at Constitution Island. The West Point side was protected by the Chain Battery and the Constitution Island side by the Marine Battery. A system of pulleys, rollers, ropes, and mid-stream anchors were used to adjust the chain&#x27;s tension to overcome the effects of river current and changing tide. Until 1783, the chain was removed each winter and reinstalled each spring to avoid destruction by ice.

The British never attempted to run the chain, in spite of Benedict Arnold claiming in correspondence with them that &quot;a well-loaded ship could break the chain.&quot; Polish engineer and Patriot volunteer Thaddeus Kościuszko contributed to the system of fortifications at West Point.

== Memorials ==

After the war, part of the Great Chain was saved for posterity and the rest relegated to the West Point Foundry furnaces near Cold Spring, New York, to be melted down. A saved portion was first displayed at the West Point ordnance compound, along with a captured mortar, as shown in a 1905 drawing.

Thirteen links are displayed at Trophy Point, one for each of the Thirteen Colonies. Also included are a swivel and clevis. The exhibit is maintained and preserved by the West Point Museum. A section of boom recovered from the river in 1855 is displayed at Washington&#x27;s Headquarters State Historic Site in Newburgh, New York.

Two links of the original chain are also at Raynham Hall in Oyster Bay, New York, the home of Robert Townsend, a cousin of iron works owner Peter Townsend, and (as &quot;Culper Jr&quot;) a member of George Washington’s Culper spy ring. Bilking the gullible, John C. Abbey, and later Pollepel Island owner Francis Bannerman, sold counterfeit chain links to collectors and museums.

Two links of the original chain are also displayed under a portrait of George Washington in the New York State Capitol

==Exegesis==

Quran 11 opens with a discussion on the nature of man and the punishment that awaits those who defy God. Thereafter, the main content of the surah is a series of stories of prophets who warned their people to follow God, the people persisting in defying God, and God punishing and killing them.

===25-49 The story of Noah===
Verses 11:25-49 tell the story of Noah and how his people did not believe his commands to follow God. The non-believers are drowned in a flood, which includes Noah&#x27;s son; Noah asks God about this act, but God rebukes Noah as being ignorant and says that Noah&#x27;s son is &quot;not a member of his family.&quot; Surah 66, At-Tahrim, elaborates on this and says that Noah&#x27;s wife is a non-believer in hell who was unfaithful to her husband.

===50-60 The prophet Hud is sent to the ʿĀd===
Verses 11:50-60 deal with the prophet Hud, the namesake of the Surah. He was sent to the ʿĀd, an Omani tribe which according to history crumbled sometime between the 3rd and 6th century AD. The ʿĀd did not believe Hud. While, Hud and those who do believe are rescued by God, followed by God inflicting a &quot;dreadful doom&quot; on them so that they were &quot;accursed in the world.&quot;

===61-68 The people of Thamud and the prophet Saleh===
Verses 11:61-68 concern the people of Thamud and the prophet Saleh. Saleh tries to convince Thamud to repent, but once more the unbelievers ignore the prophet. Saleh offers a she-camel as an offering of peace, but says that it should be left alone. If anything befalls it, the people will be punished. They did not listen to the prophet and they killed the Camal. The camel is hamstrung, Saleh and those who believe are rescued, and the unbelievers are smitten by a &quot;blast from heaven.&quot;

===69-84 Sodom and Gomorrah ===
The story of Sodom and Gomorrah is in Verses 11:69-84. Abraham and Sarah are given the news of their son and grandson&#x27;s forthcoming birth (Isaac and Jacob), after which they plead for mercy for Lot&#x27;s people. God refuses the request, saying that the punishment cannot be averted. Lot offers his daughters( for marriage )to the men of Sodom, but they respond with disinterest and say &quot;you know what we want.&quot;

===80-84 Homosexuality===
Verses 11:80-84 confirms the Biblical account of homosexuality as being the crime of Lot&#x27;s people. Angels descend to protect Lot and his daughters, and the city is destroyed by a stone rain. Lot&#x27;s wife perishes as well.

===85-95 The prophet Shu&#x27;aib sent to Midian===
Verse 11:85-95 deal with the prophet Shu&#x27;aib sent to Midian. Once more, the people ignore the prophet&#x27;s warnings; this time, Shu&#x27;aib reminds the people of the fate of the people of Noah, Hud, Saleh, and Lot. It doesn&#x27;t work, and the people spare Shu&#x27;aib from death by stoning only. this is because he comes from a powerful clan. Shu&#x27;aib and those who believe are rescued by God. Afterward, the unbelievers &quot;[were] seized by a punishment from heaven, and lay overturned in their homes in the morning as though they had not dwelt there at all.&quot;

The Ending

The remaining verses discuss the general theme once more, with occasional references to Moses. The harsh punishment is explained as &quot;We did not wrong them; they wronged themselves.&quot; Other gods are decried as false, powerless, and useless. Believers are commanded to walk the straight path and follow God, and those who disbelieve will suffer in Hell.

<text>Ar-Ra&#x27;d, ( ), or the Thunder, is the 13th chapter (sūrah) of the Qur&#x27;an, composed of 43 verses (āyāt). It has Muqattat (Quranic initials) المر (Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra or ALMR).

Verse 15 contains a prostration symbol ۩:
:۝ Whatsoever is in heaven and on earth worshippeth GOD, voluntarily or of force; and their shadows also, morning and evening. ۩ 

This sūrah is concerned with the oneness of God, the message, the Day of judgement, and the penalty. The sūrah revolves around an important axis that what is truth is clear through power and stability; what is falsehood is clear through its weakness. The verses call upon people to not be deceived by the glitter of falsehood because it is inevitably fleeting, while the truth shines throughout the entire universe. 

The name of the sūrah is from the word (Ar-Ra&#x27;d) (Thunder) in the 13th ayah.

==Q13-14==
Ibn Taymiyyah in his work, Majmu al-Fatwa al-Kubra, quoted the Marfu Hadith transmitted by Ali ibn abi Thalib, that Ra&#x27;d were the name of a group of angels who herded the dark clouds like a shepherd. Ali further narrated that thunder (Ra&#x27;dan ) is the growling voices of those angels while herding the clouds, while lightning strikes (Sawa&#x27;iq ) are a device used by those angels in gathering and herding the raining clouds. Al-Suyuti narrated from the Hadith transmitted from Ibn Abbas about the lightning angels, while giving further commentary that hot light produced by lightning (Barq ) was the emitted light produced from a whip device used by those angels. Saudi Grand Mufti Abd al-Aziz Bin Baz also ruled the sunnah practice of reciting Sura Ar-Ra&#x27;d, Ayah 13| whenever a Muslim hears thunder, as this was practiced according to the Hadith tradition narrated by Zubayr ibn al-Awwam.

==Time of Revelation ==
There has been considerable disagreement about the time of revelation among Muslim scholars going back to conflicting reports from the Companions. In his famous tafsir, Turkish scholar Elmalili Hamdi Yazir reviews the different reports and opinions in the introduction of his tafsir of Surah Ar-Ra&#x27;d. He quotes a report by Alûsî that Ikrime, Atâ and Hasen said the surah was revealed during the Meccan phase. On the other side, Companion and prominent scholar of the Quran Abdullah bin Abbas along with Kelbî, Mukatil, and Katade said it was revealed in the Medinan phase. He then quotes famous Tafsir scholars Kâdî Baydawî and Ebus-suud as saying it&#x27;s Madinan, and Fahreddin Râzî as saying it&#x27;s Meccan. 
The rhetoric of the discourse shows that this sūrah was uncovered in the ending of the Meccan phase, when Muhammad was also revealed with the surahs Yunus, Hud, and Al-A&#x27;araf. Time had passed since Muhammad last passed on the Message. His adversaries had been carrying out various plots to vanquish him and his mission, while his supporters thought that by indicating some tangible miracle the disbelievers might be brought to the Correct Path. The sūrah responded that the Devotees ought not to lose heart, and that disbelievers would explain away any miracle, even if Allah brought the dead out of their graves and caused them to talk.
==Theme==
The opening ayah articulates the fundamental topic of this sūrah: &quot;The Message of Muhammad (Allah&#x27;s tranquility arrive) is the very Truth, however, it is the shortcoming of the individuals that they are dismissing it&quot;. 

Other than this, the sūrah also addresses the rivals and their complaints, and the Devotees, who had been going through trials and were tiring. The Devotees are told that by standing by restlessly for Allah&#x27;s help, they have been ameliorated and loaded up with expectation and fortitude. The significant issues, divine Laws, and direction incorporated in the text of the discourse can be categorized as follows:-

# The Qur&#x27;an is the disclosure of Allah. 
# Trees, fruits, and vegetables are among the indications of Allah. 
# Allah never changes the state of a people except if they are eager to change themselves. 
# The individuals who don&#x27;t react to the call of Allah will have no real way to escape from hellfire.
# It is the recognition of Allah that gives quietness to hearts. 
# Rasools [Prophets] have no capacity to show any marvel of miracle with the exception of the will of Allah.

<text>Ibrahim (, &quot;Abraham&quot;) is the 14th chapter (surah) of the Qur&#x27;an with 52 verses (āyāt).

The surah emphasizes that only God knows what goes on inside a man&#x27;s heart, implying we must accept each other&#x27;s words in good faith (14:38).

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is a &quot;Meccan surah&quot;, which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina. It was revealed around 2-3 years before Hijrah, in a later stage of Muhammad preaching in Mecca when persecution of him and fellow Muslims had become severe.

==Summary==

*50-51 The dreadful doom of the wicked
*52 Warning intended to lead men to the true God 

==Name==
This chapter&#x27;s name is Surah Ibrahim (Arabic) or Chapter of Abraham (English). Surahs of the Quran are not always named after their thematic content, but in this case a large section of the surah (ayat 35–41) focus on a prayer of Abraham&#x27;s, which reveals the quality of Abraham&#x27;s character.

== Time of Revelation == 
It shows up from the tone of the Surah that it has a place with that group of the Surahs which were revealed during the last phase of the Makkan time frame. For example, v. 13 &quot;The disbelievers cautioned their Messengers, &#x27;you will need to come back to our community or we will certainly remove you from our territory&#x27;&quot; clearly shows that the mistreatment of the Muslims was at its peak at the hour of the revealing of this Surah, and the individuals of Makkah were set on ousting the Believers from that point like the disbelievers of the previous Prophets. That is the reason in v. 14 they have been cautioned, &quot;We will annihilate these evildoers,&quot; and the Believers have been comforted similar to the believers before them, &quot;and after them settle you in the land&quot; Likewise the harsh admonition contained in the finishing up partition (vv. 43-52 likewise affirms that the Surah identifies with the last phase of the Makkan Period.)

== Focal Theme == 
This Surah is a caution and an admonition to the disbelievers who were dismissing the message of Muhammad and concocting cunning plans to crush his Mission. Be that as it may, notice, impugning, scold and rebuke overwhelm admonition. This is on the grounds that a decent arrangement of reprimand had just been made in the preceding Surahs, however notwithstanding this their stiff necked attitude, ill will, opposition, wickedness, abuse and so on had rather expanded.

<text>Al-Ḥijr () is the 15th &quot;sūrah&quot; (chapter of the Quran). It has 99 āyāt (verses).

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is an earlier Meccan surah, received by Muhammad shortly after chapter 12, &quot;Yusuf&quot;, during his last year in Mecca. Like other surahs of this period, it praises God. Parts of Q15:4-74 are preserved in the Ṣan‘ā’1 lower text.

This surah takes its name from 80th verse (&quot;āyah&quot;), which refers to Mada&#x27;in Saleh, a pre-Islamic archaeological site, also called Hegra (from ) or al-Ḥijr ().

==Summary==
:1-3 Unbelievers will one day wish themselves Muslims
:4-5 Every nation has its day of grace
:6 Muhammad charged with demoniacal possession by the disbelievers (the Quraysh)
:7 The unbelievers say a true prophet would have come with a company of angels
:8 Angels are not sent to gratify curiosity, but to minister judgment
:9 God the revealer and preserver of the Quran
:10-11 The former prophets were laughed to scorn 
:12-15 The scoffing Quraysh judicially blinded 
:16-20 God declares his glory in the heaven and the earth 
:21-22 He is active in every part of Nature 
:23-25 He is the God of life, death, and judgment 
:26-29 God says men created of clay—the Jinn of fire

:34-38 He is cursed and respited until the judgment 
:39-40 Satan declares to God his purpose to seduce men 
:41-42 The elect are safe from Satan’s power

:45-50 Paradise joys in store for true believers 
:51-77 The story of Abraham and Lot&#x27;s conflict 
:78-79 The unbelieving Midianites are destroyed 
:80-81 The scoffing inhabitants of al Hijr reject their prophets though accompanied with miracles 
:82-84 Rock-hewn houses fail to save them 
:85-86 The heaven and earth created in righteousness
: 87 Command to repeat the seven verses (al-Fatiha)
:88-90 Muhammad not to consider the prosperity of infidels
:91-93 The enemies of God will surely be punished
:94-96 Muhammad commanded to preach boldly
:97-99 He is exhorted to praise and serve God until death 

== Central Theme ==
This surah contains brief mentions of Tawhid, and provides an admonition to the disbelievers. The primary subjects of the surah are:

# cautioning the individuals who dismissed the message and 
# providing solace and support to Muhammad,

The Quran never limits itself to mere rebuke; reproach and reprimand. It depends on its statute. The surah contains brief contentions for Tawhid and admonition in the tale of Adam and Satan.

==Exegesis==
===15:9 Preservation of the Quran===
Ibn Kathir says, &quot;God, may He be exalted, stated that He is the One Who revealed the Dhikr to him, which is the Qur&#x27;an, and He is protecting it from being changed or altered&quot;.

This surah warns against polytheism, saying that the pagan gods cannot create anything, and against comparisons between God and any created beings. It praises God for giving the Earth with all its wealth to mankind. According to this surah, all wonders of the natural world, such as seas, stars and mountains, are proofs of God&#x27;s infinite power. Verse 66 speaks of the miracle in milk formation in cattle: &quot;From what is within their bodies, between excretions and blood, We produce for your drink, milk, pure and agreeable to those who drink it.&quot; Verse 67 speaks of the miracle of the vine: &quot;And from the fruit of the date-palm and the vine, ye get out strong drink and wholesome food: behold, in this also is a sign for those who are wise&quot;. Quran 16:103 addresses the allegations that Muhammad has invented the Qur&#x27;an.

==Exegesis==

===9-26 &quot;Companions of the cave&quot;===
Verses 9–26 of the chapter retell the Christian folktale of the &quot;companions of the cave&quot;. A few young believers lived in a time when they were tortured for their beliefs. Upon the guidance of God, they fled the city where believers were persecuted, together with their dog, and took refuge in a cave where they fell asleep. When they awoke they found that the people of the city had become believers.

===27 No room for explicit textual changes of the Qur&#x27;an===
The commentary by Ozma Nasir Makarim Shirazi says, &quot;There is no room for diversity to enter into His Words and Knowledge. His Speech and His Knowledge is not like the speech and knowledge of human beings which, as a result of a new invention or information, has to be changed&quot;. Ibn Kathir says this verse means of the words in the Quran, &quot;no one can alter them, distort them or misinterpret them.&quot;

===32-45 The parable of the two men===
In verses 32–44, the surah discusses a parable of two men, one of whom had been given blessings from God and the other poor. The rich one wronged his soul and started showing off with his wealth and noble lineage.
Verse 36 explains that the rich man also told his companion that he doubted the existence of Judgment Day. At the end of the parable, God destroys what He had given the man.

Q18:45 Imam Musa al-Kadhim narrates in Kitab al-Kafi that Ali would bequeath his companions to view this world with the vision of an ascetic because it dislodges its residents. Ali provides them with the parable of a lush, green garden with scented dew that accumulates under the blades of grass but then gets separated from it in the morning, as Allah has said, 
:&quot;Set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world: it is like the rain which We send down from the skies: the earth&#x27;s vegetation absorbs it, But soon it becomes dry stubble, which the winds do scatter: it is (only) Allah Who prevails over all things. Q18:45.&quot; He advises his companions to &quot;look at this world and the numerous things which cause you to wonder, and the scarcity of things that benefit you.&quot;

===60-82 Islamic view of Moses===
The third main story within the chapter (verses 60–82) is that of Musa (Moses) traveling to gain knowledge from another servant of God who is never mentioned by name, in tafsir of ibn Kathir he is called Al-Khidr.

===83-98 Dhul-Qarnayn===

Finally, the surah mentions in verses 83–98 a man who traveled a great deal and reached the east and the west of the earth – namely, Dhul-Qarnayn (). In one part of the story, Dhul-Qarnayn helps a tribe of people build a massive wall of iron between two mountains to protect them from the nations of Gog and Magog. It goes on to say that this wall will be only destroyed on Judgement Day. The wall may have reflected a distant knowledge of the Great Wall of China (the 12th-century scholar al-Idrisi drew a map for Roger II of Sicily showing the &quot;Land of Gog and Magog&quot; in Mongolia), or of various Sassanid Persian walls built in the Caspian area against the northern barbarians, or a conflation of the two.

==Traditional revelational circumstances==
Arab Muslim historian and hagiographer, Ibn Ishaq, reported in his traditional book (oral traditions) of biography of Muhammad, &quot;Sirat Rasul Allah&quot; that the 18th surah of the Qur&#x27;an (which includes the story of Dhu l-Qarnayn) was revealed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad by God on account of some questions posed by rabbis residing in the city of Medina – the verse was revealed during the Meccan period of Muhammad&#x27;s life. According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad&#x27;s tribe, the powerful Quraysh, were greatly concerned about their tribesman who had started claiming prophethood and wished to consult rabbis about the matter. The Quraysh sent two men to the rabbis of Medina, reasoning that they had superior knowledge of the scriptures and about the prophets of God. The two Quraysh men described their tribesman, Muhammad, to the rabbis.

The rabbis told the men to ask Muhammad three questions:

According to Ibn Ishaq, when Muhammad was informed of the three questions from the rabbis, he said that he would have the answers in the morning but did not say &quot;if God wills it&quot;. For fifteen days, Muhammad waited eagerly for the revelation. Muhammad did not answer the question until then. Doubt in Muhammad began to grow amongst the people of Mecca. Then, after fifteen days, Muhammad received the revelation of &quot;al-Kahf&quot; as an answer to the questions.

==Virtues==
There is a hadith in Sahih Muslim that states that Muhammad said (Concerning The False Messiah, Al-Masih ad-Dajjal):
Another Hadith in Sahih Muslim states:

* &quot;Whoever reads Sura Kahf on Friday, light shall shine forth for him between the two Fridays.&quot;

==Common Muslim and Christian theme==
The story of believers falling asleep in a cave for a long time is present also in the Christian tradition, see Seven Sleepers.

<doc id="1241641" wikidata="Q220716" url="?curid=1241641" title="Maryam (surah)">
<text>Maryam (, ; Arabic cognate of &#x27;Mary&#x27;) is the 19th chapter () of the Qur&#x27;an with 98 verses (). The 114 chapters in the Quran are roughly ordered by size. The Quranic chapter is named after Mary, mother of Jesus (, ), and the Virgin Mary in Christian belief. It recounts the events leading up to the birth of Jesus. The text of the surah refers to many known prophetic figures, including Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Ishmael, Idris, Adam, Zechariah and Noah.

The Birmingham Quran manuscript preserves the final eight verses (Q19:91–98), on parchment radiocarbon dated to between 568 and 645 CE (56 BH – 25 AH). The Sanaa manuscript, dated between 578 and 669 CE (44 BH – 49 AH), includes verses 2–28.

From the perspective of Islamic tradition, (, ), it is an earlier &quot;Meccan Surah&quot;, believed to have been revealed sooner than the later revelations in Medina. Theodor Nöldeke&#x27;s chronology identifies this Surah as the 58th Surah delivered. Traditional Egyptian chronology places it as the 44th.

== 1 The &quot;mysterious letters&quot; ==
The chapter opens with the Bismillah and the &quot;mysterious letters,&quot; or &quot;muqattaʿat&quot;: Kaf; Ha; Ya; &#x27;Ayn; and Sad. Muslims believe these letters to be the peculiar marks of the Quran, and to conceal several profound mysteries, the certain understanding of which has not been communicated to any mortal except for Muhammad.

The remaining 97 verses may be divided many ways.

== 16–30 Story of Maryam ==
Q19:16–30 Translator George Sale was a solicitor and early member of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. His verse structure differs slightly from that of the later Arabic King Faud I Edition. He interprets al-kitab as &quot;the book of the Koran&quot; when he translates the Story of Mary in the Quran
:And remember in the book of the Koran the story of Mary; when she retired from her family to a place towards the east, and took a veil to conceal herself from them; and we sent our spirit Gabriel unto her, and he appeared unto her in the shape of a perfect man.
:۝ 20 She said, I fly for refuge unto the merciful God, that he may defend me from thee: if thou fearest him, thou wilt not approach me.
:He answered, Verily I am the messenger of thy LORD, and am sent to give thee a holy son.
:She said, How shall I have a son, seeing a man hath not touched me, and I am no harlot?
:Gabriel replied, So shall it be: thy LORD saith, This is easy with me; and we will perform it, that we may ordain him for a sign unto men, and a mercy from us: for it is a thing which is decreed.
:۞ Wherefore she conceived him; and she retired aside with him in her womb to a distant place; and the pains of child-birth came upon her near the trunk of a palm-tree. She said, Would to GOD I had died :before this, and had become a thing forgotten, and lost in oblivion.
:And he who was beneath her called to her, saying, be not grieved; now hath GOD provided a stream under thee;
:and do thou shake the body of the palm-tree, and it shall let fall ripe dates upon thee ready gathered. And eat, and drink, and calm thy mind. Moreover, if thou see any man, and he question thee, say, Verily I have vowed a fast unto the Merciful: wherefore I will by no means speak to a man this day.
:So she brought the child to her people, carrying him in her arms. And they said unto her, O Mary, now hast thou done a strange thing: O sister of Aaron, thy father was not a bad man, neither was thy mother a harlot.
:۝30 But she made signs unto the child to answer them; and they said, How shall we speak to him, who is an infant in the cradle?
:Whereupon the child said, Verily I am the servant of GOD.; he hath given me the book of the gospel, and hath appointed me a prophet.

==2–40 Jesus==
The first section, verses 2–40, begins with the story of Prophet Zachariah and the birth of his son John, the story of Mary and the birth of her son Jesus, and a commentary on Jesus&#x27; identity according to Islam which rejects the Christian claim that he is God&#x27;s son.

===28 Sister of Aaron===
In Q19:28, she is referred to as &#x27;Sister of Aaron&#x27;. Several occurrences of the word &quot;أخ&quot; are found in the Quran when referring to kinship or sharing the same ancestor. According to authentic Hadith, a Christian from Najran did inquire about the verse, to which Muhammad replied:

Being the namesake of prophetess Miriam, the verse links Mary to Aaron specifically instead of Moses, who himself is a key figure in the Quran. According to Sahih International, the Arabic wording implies a descendancy of Aaron:

While Mary&#x27;s genealogy is unknown in the Bible, her relative Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron. Orientalist George Sale writes:

=== Rhyme structures ===

In its original Arabic, the text of chapter 19 progresses through a series of varying rhyme structures that correspond to the content being discussed. Throughout the initial narration of the stories of Zachariah and John, Mary and Jesus, and other prophets, verses rhyme based on the syllable &#x27;ya&#x27;. When the text moves on to a commentary on the true identity of Jesus, words rhyme due to a long &#x27;ee&#x27; or &#x27;oo&#x27; preceding a nasal &#x27;m&#x27; or &#x27;n&#x27;, which is considered to give an air of settledness or finality to the subjects being discussed. The first rhyme scheme is then resumed during further accounts of earlier prophets and changes to a rhyme based on a medium &#x27;a&#x27; following a voiced &#x27;d&#x27; when the Surah discusses punishments for those who reject truth and the prophets. The strength of this vocalization is exchanged for the stronger still double &#x27;d&#x27; sound when denouncing unbelievers for their criticism.

===2–28 Sanaa 1===
The sequence of the Sanaa manuscript (&quot;Sanaa 1&quot;) chapters do not follow any other known quranic order and folio 22 is shared with Chapter 9 (al-Tawbah) (Q9:122-129).

=== 34 Significance of Mary ===

Chapter 19 is the only surah in the Qur&#x27;an that is named after a woman, initially known as KA-HA. Mary, the figure from whom this Surah takes its name. Jesus is referred to by his familial connection to her in Q19:34, the identifying title &#x27;son of Mary&#x27; places startling emphasis on Mary&#x27;s motherhood in a culture in which individuals were identified by their descent from male family member. This emphasis draws attention to the unique circumstances of Jesus&#x27;s birth; it was a miraculous moment that confirmed biological power of Mary only, because no male (human being) was needed. However, the narrative rejects the Christian belief that he Jesus is living and breathing God. The text describes the agony of Mary&#x27;s childbirth in great detail, including her wish that she had died long ago in order to avoid such pain. Despite this great hardship, God is portrayed as compassionate and attentive to Mary&#x27;s needs; He urges her not to worry and provides her with food. Feminist reading of the text points to this treatment of childbirth as verification of the process&#x27;s special significance.

Other scholars point to the interaction between Mary and the angel Gabriel as indicative of traditional gender roles at the time; when Mary, a solitary female, encounters the male angel, her first reaction is fear of the impropriety of the situation and uncertainty regarding the angel&#x27;s intentions. She can hear the angel&#x27;s message and question him only after he assures her that he has come as a messenger from God.

Maryam in Syriac () is a common adjective connoting blessing and perhaps the verb &quot;[God] exalts her&quot;.

===35–37 Dome of the Rock===
The verses from Maryam 19:35–37, which are seen by Muslims as strongly reaffirming Jesus&#x27; prophethood to God, are quoted in inscriptions in the oldest extant Islamic monument, The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.

== 41–65 Abraham ==
The second section, verses 41–65, tells of Abraham&#x27;s departure from his family&#x27;s idolatrous ways and then refers to many other prophets. The text discusses the various responses of those who heard their prophecy and the fates those hearers met; throughout these descriptions, the oneness of God is emphasized.

== 66–98 Islamic view of the Trinity ==

The third section, verses 66–98, confirms the reality of resurrection and offers depictions of the Day of Judgment alongside depictions of this life.

===91–98 Birmingham manuscript===

The Birmingham Quran manuscript preserves the final eight verses (Q19:91–98) of Chapter 19, Maryam (plus parts of Chapter 18, Al-Kahf; and Chapter 20, &quot;Taha&quot;). Located in the Cadbury Research Library, It is written in the Arabic language in Hijazi script by unknown scribe(s).

The Manuscript has been radiocarbon dated to between 568 and 645 CE (in the Islamic calendar, between 56 BH and 25 AH). Saud al-Sarhan, Director of Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, considers that the parchment might in fact have been reused as a palimpsest. Saud&#x27;s perspective has been backed by a number of Saudi-based experts in Quranic history who deny that the Birmingham/Paris Quran could have been written during the lifetime of Muhammad. They emphasize that while Muhammad was alive, Quranic texts were written without any chapter decoration, marked verse endings or use of colored inks, and did not follow any standard sequence of surahs. They maintain that those features were introduced into Quranic practice in the time of the Caliph Uthman, and so it would be entirely possible that the Birmingham leaves could have been written then, but not earlier.

Q19:91–92 dissents from the Trinitarian Christian practice of calling upon God in the name of his ‘son’. &quot; 91That they attribute to the Most Merciful a son. 92And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful that He should take a son.&quot; Q19:96 supports a requirement for &quot;Faith and deeds&quot; &quot; 96Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds – the Most Merciful will appoint for them affection.&quot;

==Notes==
The notes are mostly by Sale who in turn relied heavily on Lewis Maracci&#x27;s Latin translation. Maracci was a Roman Catholic cleric regular of the Mother of God of Lucca:

<doc id="1241644" wikidata="Q220733" url="?curid=1241644" title="Ta-Ha">
<text>Ṭā Hā (; ) is the 20th chapter (&quot;sūrah&quot;) of the Qur&#x27;an with 135 verses (&quot;āyāt&quot;). It is named &quot;Ṭā Hā&quot; because the chapter starts with the Arabic &quot;ḥurūf muqaṭṭaʿāt&quot; (disjoined letters): (Ṭāhā) which is widely mistaken to be one of the names of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, but is just one of the many unlinked letters at the beginning of many other surahs of the holy Quran.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is traditionally believed to be a Meccan surah, from the second Meccan period (615-619), which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, rather than later in Medina.

Among the subjects treated in this chapter are God&#x27;s call of Moses (), the Exodus of the Israelites and the crossing of the Red Sea (), the worship of the Golden Calf () and the Fall of Man (). The main theme of the chapter is about the existence of God. It addresses this theme through stories about Moses and Adam. Sura 20 displays several thematic and stylistic patterns described by Angelika Neuwirth in Jane McAuliffe&#x27;s book &quot;The Cambridge Companion to the Qur&#x27;an&quot;. These include the eschatological prophecies of the Quran, signs of God&#x27;s existence, and debate. Additionally, sura 20 employs what has been termed the &quot;ring structure&quot; to reinforce its central theme.

This is the chapter that convinced Umar to convert to Islam.

The oldest surviving manuscript containing chapter &quot;Ṭā Hā&quot; is a Quranic manuscript in the Mingana Collection identified as having been written on the Birmingham Quran manuscript, dated 0-25 AH.

==Structure==
The first two words of Chapter 20 are &quot;Ṭā Hā&quot;.

Sura 20 focuses upon one theme, and is structured in such a way as to reinforce this theme repeatedly. Sura 20 begins with an introduction which proclaims the greatness of God. In the body of the sura, there are two distinct stories, one about Moses and one about Adam, each of which is broken into smaller sections. Both stories are prefaced by instructions from God to Muhammad, and followed by a discussion of judgment day and the punishment of the disbelievers. To conclude the sura, there is another section restating and reinforcing the main theme, followed by a brief instruction to Muhammad. This repetitive pattern is what Carl W. Ernst terms the ring structure in his book &quot;How to Read the Qur&#x27;an&quot;. The first part of the sura, up until the story of Adam, and the second part are, thematically and structurally, copies of each other. The story about Moses gives a much longer, more detailed description to introduce the theme, and the shorter story of Adam serves to summarize and repeat the theme already discussed. The introduction and conclusion paragraphs, including the verses where God addresses Muhammad, are the bookends to the sura, and bind the stories together.

===1-8 Introduction===
This section is an introduction to the sura. It begins with God addressing Muhammad, then lists several of God&#x27;s characteristics and praises Him. In this section, there is also a mention of the Quran as a reminder of God&#x27;s existence, a theme that is seen throughout the Quran. One of the two verses in this sura mentioned in al-Wahidi&#x27;s &quot;Asbab al-Nuzul&quot; is verse 2. According to al-Wahidi, God sent this verse to Muhammad because the Quraysh were saying that Muhammad was distressed because he left their religion, and that God only sent down the Quran to distress Muhammad.

Verses 2–3: &quot;It was not to distress you [Prophet] that We sent down the Qur&#x27;an to you, but as a reminder for those who hold God in awe…&quot; 
Verse 8: &quot;God—There is no god but Him—the most excellent names belong to Him.&quot;

===9–98 The story of Moses===
This section recounts the story of Moses&#x27;s encounter with Pharaoh, and how Moses&#x27;s people were tested by God. Moses is originally tasked by God to go to Pharaoh, who has erred, and try to show him the right path. Verses 25-28: &quot;He said, my Lord, open up my heart, and make my task easy for me. Loosen the knot in my tongue, so that they may understand my speech.&quot;

Moses is triumphant over the Pharaoh because he is helped by God, but is then chased from the land by Pharaoh. After escaping, Moses leaves his people to confer with God. During his absence, his people are led awry by al-Samiri, and begin to worship a golden calf instead of God. Upon his return, Moses is furious. He exiles al-Samiri, and chastises his brother Aaron for allowing the people to worship anything other than the one true God. Samiri&#x27;s provokation of Moses&#x27;s disciples to worship a lowly calf beside the Almighty, clearly refuted God&#x27;s grace as well as Moses and Aaron&#x27;s preaching. Hence, Samiri&#x27;s defiance that is quite similar to Iblis&#x27; or Satan&#x27;s had earned him severe punishment from God.

Verse 56: &quot;We showed Pharaoh all Our signs, but he denied them and refused [to change].&quot;
Verse 85: &quot;…but God said, &#x27;We have tested your people in your absence: the Samiri has led them astray.&#x27;&quot;
Verse 97: &quot;(Moses) said: &quot;Get thee gone! but thy (punishment) in this life will be that thou wilt say, &#x27;touch me not&#x27;; and moreover (for a future penalty) thou hast a promise that will not fail: Now look at thy god, of whom thou hast become a devoted worshipper: We will certainly (melt) it in a blazing fire and scatter it broadcast in the sea!&quot; 

===99–113 Judgment day and the disbelievers&#x27; punishment===
This section again refers to the revealed nature of the Quran, and discusses the Day of Judgment. It gives a brief description of the events that will take place on judgment day. Disbelievers will be punished, but believers need not fear. This account of judgment day is an example of the eschatological nature of the Quran, as described by Angelika Neuwirth. Also in this section, in verse 113, is a specific reference to the Quran in Arabic.

Verse 99: &quot;…We have given you a Qur&#x27;an from Us.&quot;
Verses 111–112: &quot;Those burdened with evil deeds will despair, but whoever has done righteous deeds and believed need have no fear of injustice or deprivation.&quot;
Verse 113: &quot;We have sent the Qur&#x27;an down in the Arabic tongue and given all kinds of warnings in it, so that they may beware or it may make them take heed.&quot;

===114–123 The story of Adam===
This section begins with a proclamation of God&#x27;s greatness, and then another address from God to Muhammad. Then, God relates the story of Adam. When God created Adam and asked the angels to bow before him, all but Iblis did bow. Iblis (Satan) was punished and made the enemy of man. Satan tempted Adam, and Adam gave in, straying from God. But, Adam repented for his mistake and asked for God&#x27;s forgiveness quite devotedly, for which God finally forgave him.

Verse 114: &quot;Exalted be God, the one who is truly in control. [Prophet], do not rush to recite before the revelation is fully complete…&quot;
Verse 116: &quot;When We said to the angels, &#x27;Bow down before Adam,&#x27; they did. But Iblis refused.&quot;
Verse 121–122: &quot;…Adam disobeyed his Lord and was led astray—later his lord brought him close, accepted his repentance, and guided him.&quot;

===123–127 Judgment day and the disbelievers&#x27; punishment===
This section restates what was said before: Those who follow God will be rewarded, and those who do not will be punished on the Day of Judgment.

Verse 126: &quot;…You ignored Our revelations when they came to you, so today you will be ignored.&quot;
Verse 127: &quot;…The greatest and most enduring punishment is in the Hereafter.&quot;

===128–132 Instructions to the believers===
This section contains another of the patterns discussed by Neuwirth, the signs of God&#x27;s existence. It references the ruins of old cities as signs that God exists and can easily destroy people. Also, this section instructs believers to pray, and not to long for others&#x27; possessions. Verse 131 is the second verse of the sura that is mentioned in Asbab al-Nuzul. Wahidi says that this was sent down because Muhammad once desired food to entertain a guest, but could not afford it. The Jewish man selling the food refused to sell it without a security, and Muhammad was furious with this. To appease his prophet, God sent down this verse.

Verse 131: &quot;And do not gaze longingly at what We have given some of them to enjoy, the finery of this present life: We test them through this, but the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting.&quot;
Verse 132: &quot;Order your people to pray, and pray steadfastly yourself.&quot;

===133–135 Conclusion===
The conclusion includes another of the elements Neuwirth discusses: debate. In the conclusion, there is a debate between the disbelievers and Muhammad. The disbelievers wonder why God does not bring them a sign, and in the final verse God instructs Muhammad what to reply to them.

Verse 135: &quot;[Prophet], say, &#x27;We are all waiting, so you carry on waiting: you will come to learn who has followed the even path, and been rightly guided.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Al-Anbiyaʼ (, ; &quot;The Prophets&quot;) is the 21st chapter (sūrah) of the Quran with 112 verses (āyāt). Its principal subject matter is prophets of the past, who also preached the same faith as Muhammad.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is a &quot;Meccan surah&quot;, which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina.

==Historical context==
Muslims believe this surah was revealed in the Second Meccan Period and is listed as Number 65 according to the Nöldeke Chronology. Within its verses are found numerous evocations of earlier Judeo-Christian prophets. These examples help to emphasize and define Muhammad&#x27;s role as a messenger within the Quranic context. Additionally, the incorporation of pre-existing Biblical and Judaic scriptures integrate Muhammad&#x27;s prophetic mission into a larger religious framework, thus broadening the horizons of both the Quran as a text and Islam as a religious movement. The surah is thematically and stylistically characteristic of the Second Meccan Period. The verses identify the religious agency of Muhammad by relating him to preexisting Judeo-Christian figures, and from there illustrate common notional doctrines, such as: Islamic eschatology embodied in the Day of Judgment, the fates of the disbelievers and the believers, and the mercy of God. In terms of ordering and delivery, surah 21 contains a tripartite composition and traceable &quot;ring structure&quot;, in which the path of revelation comes full circle through the sequence of three distinct parts. Consisting of 112 verses in total, The Prophets maintains the Quran&#x27;s distinctive voice, in which the verses seem conscious of their own revelation and also depend on other Surahs to illustrate particular messages. This clear self-reference, or &quot;self-declaration&quot;, and intertextuality are perceptibly unique to the Quran and possess the book with a consciousness distinct from other religious texts.

<text>Joseph Francis Alaskey III (April 17, 1952 – February 3, 2016) was an American actor and comedian. He was one of Mel Blanc&#x27;s successors at the Warner Bros. Animation studio until his death. He alternated with Jeff Bergman, Greg Burson, Jim Cummings, Bob Bergen, Maurice LaMarche and Billy West in voicing Warner Bros. cartoon characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Sylvester, Tweety, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Marvin the Martian, Speedy Gonzales, Wile E. Coyote, Road Runner and Taz, among many others. He also voiced Plucky Duck on &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; from 1990 to 1995. Alaskey was the second actor to voice Grandpa Lou Pickles on the Nickelodeon cartoon &quot;Rugrats&quot; (taking over after David Doyle&#x27;s death in 1997). He voiced Lou again in the &quot;Rugrats&quot; spin-off series &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;.

==Early life==
Alaskey was born in Troy, New York, on April 17, 1952 to Joseph Francis Alaskey Jr. and Domenica &quot;Dorothy&quot; De Sorrento De Luca Alaskey. At age three, he was looking for a pair of sunglasses or people&#x27;s cigar butts so that he could portray different characters. Alaskey was interested in archeology at the age of ten. After archeology, he was interested in becoming a priest and an English teacher. Alaskey moved to New York City in the 1970s, where he worked in insurance while preparing to become an actor.

==Career==
After moving to New York City, Alaskey began his show business career as a stand-up comedian and broadcaster. He was occasionally seen onscreen impersonating Jackie Gleason, with whom he shared a physical resemblance. In the 1980s, Gleason personally chose Alaskey to re-record selected dialogue from the &quot;lost episodes&quot; of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; found in Gleason&#x27;s private collection. After Gleason died in 1987, the project was shelved. In 1985, Alaskey provided various voices for &quot;Galtar and the Golden Lance&quot;. Alaskey was in several television shows including &quot;Night Court&quot;, &quot;Head of the Class&quot;, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, and &quot;Spitting Image: The 1987 Movie Awards&quot;. His first major film was &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; as Yosemite Sam. Alaskey provided a vocal Gleason impersonation in the &quot;Mighty&#x27;s Wedlock Whimsy&quot; episode of Bakshi-Hyde Ventures&#x27; &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot; in 1988, and a Cary Grant impersonation in &quot;The Bride of Mighty Mouse&quot; episode from the same season.

Although best known for his ability to successfully impersonate &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters, Alaskey did voice work for non-Warner Bros. characters as well. He has voiced Grandpa Lou Pickles on &quot;Rugrats&quot; (inheriting the role after David Doyle&#x27;s death in 1997). He voiced Lou again in the &quot;Rugrats&quot; spin-off series, &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;. He also created the voice of Thomas Timberwolf for the internet series &quot;TimberWolf&quot;, created by animation legend Chuck Jones. He was heard briefly as a voice-over announcer for the Toon Disney channel (and sometimes Dcom extras on Disney Channel). He was the voice of Curt Connors in the &quot;Spider-Man 2 video game&quot; and Doctor Octopus in &quot;Spider-Man: Friend or Foe&quot;. Alaskey was in the independent film &quot;The Legend of Sasquatch&quot; and voiced Mermaid Man in the video games &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants: Lights, Camera, Pants!&quot; and &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty Krab&quot;. He voiced Stinkie in &quot;Casper&quot; as well as that film&#x27;s 1996 animated spin-off, &quot;The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper&quot;. Alaskey played Beano Froelich in &quot;Out of This World&quot; but left the show early in its final season, making only infrequent appearances in a few episodes. In the 1980s, he worked as the original announcer on the short-lived game show &quot;Couch Potatoes&quot;, hosted by Marc Summers. Alaskey made several onscreen appearances, portraying the show&#x27;s &quot;next door neighbor&quot;. For the show&#x27;s final weeks, he was replaced by Jim McKrell and the &quot;next door neighbor&quot; concept was dropped. During this time, he was also a panelist on &quot;The New Hollywood Squares&quot;, hosted by John Davidson.

In 2003, he took over the roles of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck in the film &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;. He also, at times, provided the voices for Sylvester, Tweety, and other Looney Tunes characters. Alaskey was the primary voice for Plucky Duck on &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;. 

In 2008, Alaskey participated in a unique interview conducted by Logan Leistikow and released by TheYellowMic.com. He answered questions and told his story, then went out onto Hollywood Boulevard and talked to people on the street who wanted to hear his famous voices. This was the first time Alaskey had performed in public in this manner.

In 2014, Alaskey started narrating the television documentary series &quot;Murder Comes to Town&quot;, which airs on the Investigation Discovery Network.

Alaskey&#x27;s only leading role in a live-action film was as lovable loser Ron Douglas in the black comedy &quot;Lucky Stiff&quot;, directed by Anthony Perkins and co-starring Donna Dixon and Jeff Kober.

==Death==
Alaskey died in his apartment in Green Island, New York, from cancer with his brother by his side on February 3, 2016, at the age of 63. Five days later, his wake was held at St Patrick&#x27;s Cemetery in Watervliet.

<text>The Brazilian teal or Brazilian duck (Amazonetta brasiliensis) is the only duck in the genus Amazonetta. It is widely distributed in eastern South America.

==Taxonomy==
The Brazilian teal was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other ducks, swans and geese in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas brasiliensis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Mareca alia species&quot; (the second Mareca) that was described in 1648 by the German naturalist Georg Marcgrave in his &quot;Historia Naturalis Brasiliae&quot;. The Brazilian teal is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Amazonetta&quot; that was introduced by the German zoologist Hans von Boetticher in 1929.

It was formerly considered a &quot;perching duck&quot;, but more recent analyses indicate that it belongs to a clade of South American dabbling ducks which also includes the crested duck, the bronze-winged duck, and possibly the steamer ducks.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. b. brasiliensis&quot; (Gmelin, 1789) – the nominate race, found in Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, central Venezuela, eastern Colombia, and northeastern Peru
* &quot;A. b. ipecutiri&quot; (Vieillot, 1816) – found in Brazil, northern Argentina, eastern Bolivia, Uruguay, and Paraguay

==Description==
The ducks are light brown in colour. Drakes distinguish themselves from females in having red beaks and legs, and in having a distinctive pale grey area on the side of its head and neck. The colour of these limbs is much duller in females.

==Distribution and habitat==
They can be found throughout eastern South America, from central Brazil, to Uruguay, to northern and eastern Argentina, Paraguay, central Venezuela, northeastern Peru, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, eastern Bolivia, and eastern Colombia. Their preferred habitat is a body of freshwater away from the coast with dense vegetation nearby.

==Behaviour==
Brazilian teal live in pairs or in small groups of up to twenty birds. Both parents look after their hatchlings. They eat seeds, fruits, roots and insect, while ducklings eat only insects.

==Status==
They are plentiful and are listed as of Least Concern.

<text>Mike Ammann (born February 8, 1971) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a goalkeeper in England and Major League Soccer.

==Youth==
Ammann was born in Orange, California. The younger brother of Bob Ammann, he played for the Los Angeles Heat in the Western Soccer League in 1989. In 1989, Ammann graduated from Mater Dei High School. He entered Cal State-Fullerton where he played on the men&#x27;s soccer team from 1990 to 1993. In 1993, the Titans went to the NCAA Final Four. That year, he also played for the East Los Angeles Cobras in the USISL.

==Professional==
After Mike Stevens, the director of Charlton Athletic, saw Ammann play in the 1994 NCAA Final Four, he offered him a trial. Ammann played for Charlton Athletic in the second tier of English football from 1994 to 1996.

When Major League Soccer started in 1996, Ammann was initially not signed, but late in the inaugural season he signed with the then-Kansas City Wiz. In 1997, he set a league record (since broken) of twenty-one wins, and ranked fourth in voting for the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year award.
Before the 1999 season, Ammann was traded to the MetroStars with Mark Chung for Tony Meola and Alexi Lalas. That season the MetroStars squad finished with the worst record in league history. However, Ammann played well despite the lack of success, and was named Defensive Player of the Year two consecutive seasons.
The 2000 season was Ammann&#x27;s best as the Metros went through a rebirth. Ammann was selected to the 2000 MLS All Star game and started in goal for the Eastern Conference.

===Injuries and retirement===
Ammann missed the last five weeks of the 2000 MLS season after Mamadou Diallo collided with him in a game against the Tampa Bay Mutiny. Diallo stepped on Ammann, resulting in three broken three ribs, a punctured lung, and a concussion. The incident, which was dubbed &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; by Metro teammate Mike Petke, saw Diallo receive no punishment. Ammann missed the rest of the regular season because of these injuries, returning for the playoffs and shutting out the Chicago Fire 2–0.

With the emergence of Tim Howard for the MetroStars, Ammann was traded to D.C. United for Richie Williams and an allocation before the 2001 MLS season. Injuries dogged him, however, and he retired after not playing a minute in 2002. Ammann&#x27;s doctor had never performed the procedure prior to operating on Ammann and left him permanently disabled. Ammann suffers disabilities in his right and left arms and hands. Dr. Hazel was found guilty by a jury of malpractice in D.C. Courts.

==Post-soccer career==
Since 2003, Ammann worked in information technology and became the director of channel sales at Tintri. Ammann worked for Hitachi, ViON and EMC. In 2010, 
Ammann founded Twenty-Four Seven Goalkeeper, a goalkeeper academy in the Northern Virginia area, which taught both boys and girls of all ages. Ammann then merged 247GK with GK Icon and founded GK Icon USA some time before 2013. Ammann is currently the President of Purechannels, a global B2B Channel Marketing Agency. www.purechannels.com

<text>Carl Michael Ziehrer (more rarely spelled Karl Michael Ziehrer) (2 May 1843 – 14 November 1922) was an Austrian composer. In his lifetime, he was one of the fiercest rivals of the Strauss family; most notably Johann Strauss II and Eduard Strauss.

==Biography==

Born in Vienna, Ziehrer was taught music by Simon Sechter, a famous Viennese music theorist and pedagogue, and Johann Emanuel Hasel. He was soon discovered by music publisher Carl Haslinger, one of Johann Strauss II&#x27;s publishers, who had fallen out with Strauss regarding the receipts from the latter&#x27;s lucrative Russian venture.

Haslinger sought to promote his promising young ward, and on 21 November 1863 the young conductor appeared as the head of a newly formed orchestra aimed at toppling the Strauss dynasty at the Dianabad-Saal in Vienna. Not long after that, he secured a place at one of the Viennese military bands. As was the current trend, he took over as Kapellmeister of a large civilian orchestra in 1873. He also published the journal &quot;Deutsche Musikzeitung&quot; around the same time, and was credited as being one of the important sources of music study in the late 1870s.

Not long after founding the music journal, he changed his publisher to Döblinger, and toured Eastern Europe and Germany for many years, earning a good reputation as a strict yet efficient conductor. It was in 1881 that he met his future wife, Marianne Edelmann, a famous operetta singer, in Berlin.

Throughout the period between 1885 and 1893, Ziehrer toured extensively and was a military bandmaster, having assumed the direction of the &quot;Militärmusik des Infanterieregiments Hoch- und Deutschmeister&quot;, as well as the &quot;Deutschmeister&quot; decoration. His fame was such that he was invited to perform at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. After that, in a flurry of events, he toured 41 German cities and finally returned to Vienna, where he formed an even larger and successful orchestra that specialized in playing dance music. At this point, his works began to gain a wider circulation among the music-loving Viennese and work such as &quot;Weaner Mad’ln&quot;, Op. 388, as well as the more famous &quot;Wiener Bürger&quot;, Op. 419, were received with greater appreciation, the latter even temporarily triumphing over Strauss compositions when first published in 1890.

Despite being a strong challenger of the Strauss music dynasty, he was unable to triumph over them and remained under their influence, which numbered among them his personal appearance; he maintained a &quot;Schnurrbart&quot; (moustache) as well as a similar hair-style. By the turn of the century, Ziehrer felt that he needed to devote his time and attention towards composing, and his military band participation waned until he relinquished his last position in 1899, the year Johann Strauss II died.

Ziehrer enjoyed success in the operetta writing business, with stage works such as &quot;Die Landstreicher&quot; in 1899, but it was with the operetta &quot;Fremdenführer&quot; (Tourist Guide) that he achieved stage success. He was one of the composers who bridged the &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; of operetta with the new influence of the emerging &#x27;Silver Age&#x27;, with composers such as Franz Lehár, who would dominate the operetta scene for many years later on.
In 1909, he was awarded the honorary post of the &#x27;KK Hofballmusikdirektor&#x27;, which was created for Johann Strauss I more than half a century earlier, and subsequently dominated within the Strausses with Johann Strauss II and Eduard Strauss also holding the office for many years. He was also the last person to hold this post, with the destruction of the Habsburg dynasty in World War I resulting in its dissolution. During the time before the war, he worked well with composers Franz Lehár, Oscar Straus, and Leo Fall, and was guest conductor at their concerts on many occasions.

The outbreak of the war sealed his career as a composer, and most of his property was destroyed. He died a poor and forgotten man on 14 November 1922 in Vienna probably of a stroke. He was buried in the Zentralfriedhof in the graves of honour. His wife was buried beside him.

His rich musical heritage may not be comparable to the Strausses, who dominated for well over a century, but he was more prolific, having composed over 600 waltzes, polkas and marches, which are still performed today. Some of his works are even more Viennese in nature than that of the Strausses. His works are vigorous and forceful, with cheerful melodies written even near the end of the Habsburg dynasty.

Ziehrer was the subject of 1945 biopic &quot;Viennese Girls&quot; and was played by Willi Forst who also directed the film.

<text>The Evangelical Lutheran Free Church, or the Free Church as it is commonly known (, shortened &quot;Frikirken&quot;), is a nationwide Lutheran church in Norway, consisting of 83 congregations and 21,817 baptised members. It was founded in 1877 in Moss. It is distinct from the Church of Norway, although both churches are members of the Lutheran World Federation. The Free Church is economically independent.

== Doctrine and polity ==

The Evangelical Lutheran Free Church is founded on the Bible and the confession of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. The &quot;Frikirken&quot; &#x27;believes, teaches, and confesses that the Bible is the only rule and guideline for faith, doctrine, and life&#x27;. 

As a free church, the &quot;Frikirken&quot; is founded upon the local congregation (congregationalism). In each local congregation those who are baptised and confess the Christian faith are endowed with voting rights and responsibilities. Each congregation is led by ordained elders (presbyters), and each has the authority to call its clergy and all other personnel and pass its own church laws. 

The highest authority in the denomination is the synod, which is a common national organisation, peopled with presbyters and representatives from each individual congregation. The synod convenes every three years, and it is governed by the synod board, which is made up of seven members, each of whom is elected by the general synod. 

== Schools, colleges, and publications ==
The &quot;Frikirken&quot; has established several educational and publishing organisations. In 1921, the &quot;Frikirken&quot; founded the &quot;Fredtun Frikirkens&quot; Secondary School, which has now been renamed the &quot;Stavern Folkehøyskole&quot; (Stavern Folk High School). The &quot;Frikirken&quot; also established the Lutheran Bible and Church Seminary (LBM) in 1965. The Seminary was eventually renamed the &quot;Frikirkens&quot; Theological College (FTH), before becoming the University College of Staffeldts Gate (HiS) in 2004, following a merge with the Bible School in Oslo. In January 2013, HiS became part of the NLA University College, and was subsequently renamed the NLA University College Staffeldtsgate. In partnership with several other denominational and missional bodies, the &quot;Frikirken&quot; contributed to the establishment of the China Lutheran Seminary in 1966, in Hsinchu City, Taiwan.

The &quot;Frikirken&quot; instituted its own publication, &quot;Budbæreren&quot; (the Messenger) in 1883. It releases ten issues annually.

<doc id="1241690" wikidata="Q3161890" url="?curid=1241690" title="Jane Porter">
<text>Jane Porter (3 December 1775 – 24 May 1850) was an English historical novelist, dramatist and literary figure. Her bestselling novels, &quot;Thaddeus of Warsaw&quot; (1803) and &quot;The Scottish Chiefs&quot; (1810) are seen as among the earliest historical novels in a modern style and among the first to become bestsellers. They were abridged and remained popular among children well into the twentieth century.

==Life==
Jane Porter was born in Durham, England, the third of five children of the Irishman William Porter and Jane Blenkinsop Porter of Durham. Tall and beautiful as she grew up, young Jane Porter&#x27;s grave air earned her the nickname La Penserosa after John Milton&#x27;s poem &quot;Il Penseroso&quot;. After her father&#x27;s death, Jane&#x27;s family moved to Edinburgh, where she studied at a charity school under the schoolmaster George Fulton. Her family was acquainted with Sir Walter Scott. After stints in Durham and Ireland, the Porter family moved to London in the 1790s, where the sisters entered a circle of famous and future-famous actors, artists, and literary women, including Elizabeth Inchbald, Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Hannah More, Elizabeth Hamilton, Selina Davenport, Elizabeth Benger and Mrs Champion de Crespigny.

Porter&#x27;s siblings also achieved some fame. Her sister Anna Maria Porter was likewise a novelist. Her brother Sir Robert Ker Porter became a painter.

She died in Bristol at the age of 74.

==Works==
Porter is seen to have &quot;crafted and pioneered many of the narrative tools most commonly associated with both the national tale and the historical novel,&quot; though her claims in her lifetime to have done so were often ridiculed and dismissed. Her 1810 work &quot;The Scottish Chiefs&quot;, about William Wallace, one of the earliest examples of the historical novel, was very successful. The French version was banned by Napoleon. It was said to have influenced Scott and other writers and has remained popular with Scottish children. &quot;The Pastor&#x27;s Fireside&quot; (1817) was a story set in the 18th century about the later members of the House of Stuart. Though one of the most popular writers of her time, the profligacy and financial indecisions of her brothers kept her very poor, as she and Anna Maria were constantly obliged to use their incomes to pay off their brothers&#x27; debts.
Porter wrote &quot;Thaddeus of Warsaw&quot; in 1803, set in the late 18th century Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite its success, Porter did not benefit financially, as its copyright was held by its various publishers. To gain income from it, she resorted to ostensibly new editions published with prefaces and minor changes. She applied unsuccessfully for a literary pension, and being personally &quot;totally destitute or nearly so&quot;, had to move between homes of her friends.

Porter contributed to periodicals and wrote the play &quot;Switzerland&quot; (1819), which seems to have been deliberately sabotaged by its lead, Edmund Kean, and closed after its first performance. She is sometimes associated with the 1822 production &quot;Owen, Prince of Powys&quot;, which closed after only three performances, but this was actually by Samson Penley.

Porter also wrote &quot;Tales Round a Winter Hearth&quot; (1826) and &quot;Coming Out; and The Field of Forty Footsteps&quot; (1828) with her sister, Anna Maria. A romance, &quot;Sir Edward Seaward&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1831), purporting to record actual circumstances and edited by Jane, was written by her brother, Dr William Ogilvie Porter, as letters in the University of Durham Porter archives show.

In her later years, Porter continued to write pieces for journals. Many appeared anonymously or were simply signed &quot;J. P.&quot; Her wide-ranging topics included Peter the Great, Simón Bolívar, and the African explorer Dixon Denham.

==Influences==
Porter, like many contemporaries, was fascinated by Lord Byron. The villain in &quot;The Pastor&#x27;s Fireside&quot;, Duke Wharton, has been said to cast &quot;an unmistakably Byronic shadow&quot;. Additional influences on her writing included her schoolmaster George Fulton, Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; and Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot;. She in turn influenced writers in her time.

<text>Anna Maria Porter (1778–1832) was a British poet and novelist.

==Life==
The sister of Jane Porter and Robert Ker Porter, she was probably born on 17 December 1778 and was baptized in Salisbury on 25 December 1778. She spent her infancy in Durham, England, the home town of her mother. Her father, William Porter (1735–1779), served as an army surgeon for 23 years and died before she was a year old. He is buried in St Oswald&#x27;s Church, Durham. After the death of her father, her family settled in Edinburgh, where the Porter children attended charity school and enjoyed the friendship of Walter Scott.

Throughout her life, Anna Maria was known as Maria (pronounced ). Maria, being fair-haired, pretty, and outgoing, was nicknamed &#x27;L&#x27;Allegra&#x27;. At the age of 14, Maria published her first book, &quot;Artless Tales&quot;. She was in London by the 1790s, publishing verse in the &quot;Universal Magazine&quot;. After &quot;Artless Tales&quot;, she also wrote a short novel &quot;Walsh Colville&quot; published anonymously in 1797. Though her sister Jane was the more acclaimed and popular writer, Maria was the more prolific. &quot;The Hungarian Brothers&quot; (1807), a historical romance set against the French Revolutionary Wars, was a success and went into several editions.

Maria also produced the humanitarian &quot;Tales of Pity on Fishing, Shooting and Hunting&quot; in 1814, and collaborated with her sister on collections of stories. She was one of the era&#x27;s most published and respected fiction writers, with many of her works translated into French, but she also published poems and short stories and had an opera produced.

Anna Maria Porter died on 21 June 1832 from a typhus fever at the house of Mrs Colonel Booth, a friend of her brother Dr William Ogilvie Porter, Montpelier, near Bristol. Maria was buried at the churchyard of St Paul in that city.

<text>The Bartek Oak () is one of the oldest oak trees in Poland. It grows in Zagnańsk near Kielce in the Świętokrzyskie Mountains. Its age, previously estimated at up to 1200 years, has recently been established to be 686 years (in 2016), with a corer used to extract a sample for a ring count. An accurate count is impossible, as Bartek&#x27;s interior has hollowed with age. There are several older trees in Poland, both oaks and yews (some over 1000 years old), yet none of them have matched Bartek&#x27;s fame.

The 33.5-metre tall Bartek measures 970 cm at CBH (circumference at breast height) and 13.5 metres in girth at its base. Its crown spreads about 40 metres. Legend has it that King Casimir III (1310–1370) held court under Bartek and that King Jan III Sobieski rested under the oak on his way back from the Battle of Vienna (1683). He reputedly hid a Turkish sabre, an arquebus and a bottle of wine inside it to commemorate the victory.

The oak is still alive, but is in decline. In 1829 it had 14 main branches, today only 8 are left. In the 1920s the hollow inside the trunk was covered with limestone. The limestone was removed in the 1960s, replaced with resin-based filling and covered with bark. The living sapwood is very thin (5–20 cm). The weakened trunk has begun to lean toward the heavy branches.

<text>Humphrey Prideaux (3 May 1648 – 1 November 1724) was a Cornish churchman and orientalist, Dean of Norwich from 1702. His sympathies inclined to Low Churchism in religion and to Whiggism in politics.

==Life==
The third son of Edmond Prideaux, he was born at Padstow, Cornwall, on 3 May 1648. His mother was a daughter of John Moyle. After education at Liskeard grammar school and Bodmin grammar school, he went to Westminster School under Richard Busby, recommended by his uncle William Morice. On 11 December 1668 he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he had obtained a studentship. He graduated B.A. 22 June 1672, M.A. 29 April 1675, B.D. 15 November 1682, D.D. 8 June 1686. In January 1674, Prideaux recorded in his letters a visit to his home of William Levett; with Levett came Lord Cornbury, son of the Earl of Clarendon, Levett&#x27;s principal patron. In other letters, Prideaux mentioned alliances with Levett in ongoing church political manoeuvrings. At the university he was known for scholarship; John Fell employed him in 1672 on an edition of &quot;Florus&quot;. He also worked on Edmund Chilmead&#x27;s edition of the chronicle of John Malalas.

Prideaux gained the patronage of Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham, as tutor to his son Charles, and in 1677 he obtained the sinecure rectory of Llandewy-Velfrey, Pembrokeshire. In 1679 Finch presented him to the rectory of St Clement&#x27;s, Oxford, which he held till 1696. He was appointed also, in 1679, Busby&#x27;s Hebrew lecturer in Christ Church College. Finch gave him in 1681 a canonry at Norwich, and Sir Francis North in February 1683 presented him to the rectory of Bladon, Oxfordshire, which included the chapelry of Woodstock. He retained his studentship at Christ Church, where he was acting as unsalaried librarian.

Prideaux married and left Oxford for Norwich, ahead of James II&#x27;s appointment (October 1686) of John Massey, a Roman Catholic, as Dean of Christ Church. He exchanged (1686) Bladon for the rectory of Saham-Toney, Norfolk, which he held till 1694. He engaged in controversy with Roman Catholics, especially on the point of the validity of Anglican orders. As canon of Norwich he improved the financial arrangements of the chapter, and put the records in order. In December 1688 he was made archdeacon of Suffolk by his bishop William Lloyd, an office which he held till 1694. While Lloyd became a nonjuror, Prideaux exerted himself at his archidiaconal visitation (May 1689) to secure the taking of the oaths; out of three hundred parishes in his archdeaconry only three clergymen became nonjurors. At the Convocation which opened on 21 November 1689 Prideaux was an advocate for changes in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, with a view to the comprehension of Dissenters. Subsequently he officially corrected a lax interpretation of the Toleration Act 1688, as though it exempted from the duty of attendance on public worship. Gilbert Burnet consulted him in 1691 about a measure for prevention of pluralities, and Prideaux drafted a bill for this purpose. Richard Kidder consulted him in the same year about a bill for preventing clandestine marriages.

From 1689 to 1694 Prideaux resided at Saham. He declined in 1691 the Oxford Hebrew chair vacated by the death of Edward Pococke, a step which he afterwards regretted. Saham did not suit his health, and he returned to Norwich. In a letter written on 28 November 1694 after receiving the news of John Tillotson&#x27;s death, he said that he had no expectations of future advancement. Early in 1697 he was presented to the vicarage of Trowse, near Norwich, a chapter living, which he held till 1709. He succeeded Henry Fairfax as dean of Norwich, and was installed on 8 June 1702. On the translation to Ely (31 July 1707) of John Moore, Prideaux recommended the appointment of Charles Trimnell, his fellow canon, as bishop.

In 1721 Prideaux gave his collection of oriental books to Clare Hall, Cambridge. From about 1709 he had suffered severely from the stone, which prevented him from preaching. An operation was badly managed; attacks of rheumatism and paralysis reduced his strength. He died on 1 November 1724, at the deanery, Norwich, and was buried in the nave of the Norwich Cathedral, where there was a stone to his memory, with an epitaph composed by himself.

==Works==
Among his other works were a &quot;Life of Mahomet&quot; (1697), with a polemical tract against the deists. Its scholarship depended in particular on Pococke. It was criticised by George Sale, in his notes to his translation of the &quot;Quran&quot;. Its year-of-publication reprint was followed by a third, and a fourth; and four further editions between 1712 and 1718, and yet another reprint in 1723.

&quot;The Old and New Testament connected in the History of the Jews and Neighbouring Nations&quot; (1715–17) was a significant work, of which many editions were brought out; it drew on James Ussher. It was among the earliest English works to use the term &quot;Vulgar Era&quot;, though Kepler used the term as early as 1635. It covered the historical interval between the Old and New Testaments, and led to a controversy between Prideaux and his cousin, Walter Moyle. Jean Le Clerc wrote a critical examination of it, which was published in English in 1722. The French translation was by Moses Solanus and Jean-Baptiste Brutel de la Rivière.

He published the following pamphlets: &quot;The Validity of the Orders of the Church of England&quot; (1688), &quot;Letter to a Friend on the Present Convocation&quot; (1690), &quot;The Case of Clandestine Marriages stated&quot; (1691). Other works were:

* &quot;Marmora Oxoniensia&quot;, &amp;c., Oxford, 1676, a catalogue and chronology of the Arundel marbles and related collections; the numerous typographical errors were ascribed to the carelessness of Thomas Bennet as corrector of the press. There were later editions, by Michael Maittaire and Richard Chandler.

<text>Thomas Pringle (5 January 1789 – 5 December 1834) was a Scottish writer, poet and abolitionist. Known as the father of South African poetry, he was the first successful English language poet and author to describe South Africa&#x27;s scenery, native peoples, and living conditions.

==Life==
Born at Douglas(now named &quot;Blakelaw&quot;), four miles south of Kelso in Roxburghshire, where he also married his wife, Anju Heyneke and attended Kelso Grammar School and went on to study at Edinburgh University, where he developed a talent for writing. Due to an injury in an accident in infancy, he did not follow his father into farming, but after attending Kelso grammar school and later Edinburgh University worked as a clerk and continued writing, soon succeeding to editorships of journals and newspapers, including William Blackwood&#x27;s &quot;Edinburgh Monthly Magazine&quot;. He features as the character Mehibosheth in &quot;John Paterson&#x27;s Mare&quot;, James Hogg&#x27;s allegorical satire on the Edinburgh publishing scene first published in the &quot;Newcastle Magazine&quot; in 1825.

In 1816 one of Pringle&#x27;s poems celebrating the countryside near Kelso came to the attention of the novelist Sir Walter Scott, who admired it. A friendship developed between the two and by Scott&#x27;s influence, whilst facing hard times and unable to earn a living, Pringle secured free passage and a British Government resettlement offer of land in South Africa, to which he emigrated in 1820. This was a scheme to populate the eastern frontier of the Cape with English-speaking settlers and provide a buffer against the Africans. He headed a party whose farms were granted in the Baviaans River Valley miles away from the bulk of the 5,000 other settlers who were granted land in the area of Grahamstown. Being lame, he himself took to literary work in Cape Town rather than farming, opened a school with fellow Scotsman John Fairbairn, and conducted two newspapers, the &quot;South African Journal&quot;, and &quot;South African Commercial Advertiser&quot;. However, both papers became suppressed for their free criticisms of the Colonial Government, and his school was closed.

Without a livelihood, and with debts, Thomas returned to Britain and settled in London. An anti-slavery article which he had written in South Africa before he left was published in the &quot;New Monthly Magazine&quot;, and brought him to the attention of Buxton, Zachary Macaulay and others, which led to his being appointed Secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society. He began working for the Committee of the Anti-Slavery Society in March 1827, and continued for seven years. He offered work to Mary Prince, a former slave, enabling her to write her autobiography describing her experiences under slavery in the West Indies. This book caused a sensation, partly arising from libel actions disputing its accuracy, and went into many editions. He also published &quot;African Sketches&quot; and books of poems, such as &quot;Ephemerides&quot;.

As Secretary to the Anti-Slavery Society he helped steer the organisation towards its eventual success; in 1834, with a widening of the electoral franchise, the Reformed British Parliament passed legislation to bring an end to slavery in the British dominions – the aim of Pringle&#x27;s Society. Pringle signed the Society&#x27;s notice to set aside 1 August 1834 as a religious thanksgiving for the passing of the Act. However, the legislation did not come into effect until August 1838, and Thomas Pringle was unable to witness this moment; he had died from tuberculosis in December 1834 at the age of 45.

In his memory, Josiah Conder&#x27;s &quot;Biographical Sketch of the Late Thomas Pringle&quot; (1835) was published, sold bound together with Thomas Pringle&#x27;s own &quot;Narrative of a Residence in South Africa&quot; (1834).

His remains were interred in Bunhill Fields, where he was commemorated with a memorial stone bearing an elegant inscription by William Kennedy. In 1970, however, his remains were brought to South Africa, to the church near the farm his family owned in the Baviaans Valley, and re-interred there.

<text>The Hong Kong Railway Museum is a railway museum in Tai Po, Hong Kong. It is now under the management of the Leisure and Cultural Service Department. Opened on 20 December 1985, it is located at the site where the old Tai Po Market railway station was built in 1913. Admission to the museum is free.

==History==
The Kowloon–Canton Railway (British Section) opened in 1910 in Tai Po Market was one of the stops in the New Territories. The station building was erected in 1913. Since then, it has acted as a centre of administration and trade, which indirectly boosted Tai Po Market&#x27;s economy by bringing traders there.

The Kowloon–Canton Railway was electrified in 1983 and the station was taken out of service, with the opening of the new Tai Wo station north of it and the new Tai Po Market station south of it. One year later, the Old Tai Po Market Railway Station was declared a monument. The site, together with the buildings and relevant exhibits, were then given to Regional Council by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation for the of the museum.

The museum opened on 20 December 1985.

==Architecture==
The building of the station is unique in the way of architectural style among original Kowloon–Canton Railway (British Section). It is of indigenous Chinese architectural style, with many small figures decorating the exterior, such as are commonly found in existing old southern Chinese temples.

==Exhibits==
===Inside the museum===
On the left of the museum, there is an exhibition room of train tickets and train models of not only KCR trains but also Japanese Shinkansen and Eurostar. The further internal part of the room is a refurbished ticket office and signalling house.

===Vehicles on the track===

Two locomotives are on exhibition at the museum:
* EMD G12 Diesel-electric locomotive #51, introduced in Hong Kong in 1955, which is called &quot;Sir Alexander&quot;, named after former Governor Alexander Grantham. This was the first diesel electric locomotive in Hong Kong and marked KCR&#x27;s transition from steam to diesel. After a new batch of diesel locomotives arrived in Hong Kong in late 2003, the Sir Alexander retired from service. KCR Corporation staff spent more than 1000 hours restoring it to its original 1955 appearance, removing rust, repainting it dark green, and restoring the traditional logo. It was donated to the museum on 18 May 2004.
* EMD G26 Diesel-electric locomotive #60, purchased in 1973, which is called &quot;Peter Quick&quot;. Originally purchased by the KCR, it was leased to the MTR after the MTR-KCR merger. It was retired in 2022 and moved to the Hong Kong Railway Museum for exhibition in October 2023.
* A W. G. Bagnall 0-4-4T narrow gauge steam locomotive #17BG, restored from the Philippines in 1995. The locomotive is one of two that formerly ran on the narrow gauge Sha Tau Kok Railway line between Fanling and Sha Tau Kok. When that closed, they were used by sugar mills in the Philippines. The other locomotive of the pair was also brought back to Hong Kong and is reported to be undergoing restoration.

There are seven coaches on the tracks for public viewing and appreciation of the contrast between the old and the new. 
* A 1911 third-class coach, #302
* A 1921 engineering brake coach, #002
* A 1921 third-class coach, #313
* A 1955 third-class coach, #223 (an educational video room)
* A 1955 luggage coach, #229
* A 1964 first-class coach, #112
* A 1976 ordinary-class coach, #276

There are also a pump trolley and a diesel-engined railcar.

A 1:1 scale model of a non-refurbished East Rail line Metro Cammell EMU was once on display at the Museum, but was removed to make space for locomotive #51.

<text>The brown teal (Anas chlorotis; ) is a species of dabbling duck of the genus &quot;Anas&quot; native to New Zealand. For many years it had been considered to be conspecific with the flightless Auckland and Campbell teals in &quot;Anas aucklandica&quot;; the name &quot;brown teal&quot; has also been largely applied to that entire taxon. Common in the early years of European colonisation, the &quot;brown duck&quot; (as it had been often referred to) was heavily harvested as a food source. Its numbers quickly fell, especially in the South Island, and in 1921 they became fully protected. Captive breeding and releasing into predator-controlled areas has seen good localised populations re-introduced around the country in recent years.

==Description==
There are no distinctive differences between a male, female and a juvenile brown teal during non-mating season. They all have a white ring around their eyes as well as a mottled brown color on their heads and throat. During breeding season the male will begin to change color, now having a green colored head, chestnut colored breast and a white stripe on each side of their body. They will sometimes also have a white clerical neck band. This does vary as some males do tend to be more colorful than others.

==Taxonomy==

Pateke is the progenitor of the flightless Auckland teal and Campbell teals but all are now recognised as separate species on account of their geographic isolation and their plumage, size and genetic distinctions. The insular &quot;A. aucklandica&quot; and &quot;A. nesiotis&quot; are recognised as distinct species, but are still sometimes referred to as being part of the &quot;brown teal group&quot;. The use of the name &#x27;pateke&#x27; is now common and is specific for this particular species.

Concerns have been raised about establishing genetically similar populations during re-introduction. The original captive pateke were sourced from Great Barrier Island, where only one haplotype was found in abundance, compared with eleven haplotypes found in the other remaining population at Mimiwhangata. The newly released flocks exclusively contain these birds of captive origin, and diversity is perhaps now not being fully represented in the National population.

The former population of Fiordland brown teal, which died out by 2013 has been replaced with captive-origin birds. Sequencing showed striking similarity to grey duck and mallard sequences, with which they group. It therefore seems extremely likely that the former Fiordland population of brown teal have at sometime in the past hybridised extensively with these invading species.

==Behaviour==
The brown teal is largely nocturnal in habit by dabbling duck standards. This is an evolutionary response to natural diurnal predators such as the New Zealand falcon, Eyles&#x27; harrier, or skuas further south in their range. Brown teal have no defense against introduced cats, dogs, stoats &amp; ferrets, which can kill adults &amp; ducklings, or against rats which eat eggs.

==Diet==

It feeds by dabbling and upending, like its relatives. Its diet consists mainly of aquatic invertebrates like insects and their larvae, or crustaceans. It appears quite fond of mollusks. Small species such as pipi (&quot;Paphies australis&quot;) and large wedge shell (&quot;Macomona liliana&quot;) are eaten whole and crushed in the gizzard. For feeding on larger cockles such as &quot;Austrovenus stutchburyi&quot; (New Zealand cockle), at least some New Zealand teals have developed a peculiar technique, as of now undocumented in other birds, to force their rather soft bills between the cockle shells and tear out the flesh with a jackhammer-like pumping motion. At night brown teal will forage on land some distance from the streams used as a refuge during the day (Worthy 2002).

==Breeding==
Nest of dry grass near water or under shelter of large &quot;Carex&quot;, heavily lined with down. A clutch of four to eight creamy-brown eggs is laid. Incubation is done by only the female and takes 27–30 days. The male stays in his territory as a guard, aggressive to all other waterfowl.

==Distribution &amp; conservation==
This species is endangered and occurs predominantly on offshore islands but also in predator-proof sanctuaries on the mainland such as Tawharanui Regional Park. Formerly, it was widespread on the New Zealand mainland, but it disappeared there due to introduced predators like cats, dogs and rats, which easily preyed on this unwary, weakly flying bird. According to the IUCN categorization as VU D1, fewer than 1000 adult birds remain. The species has recently been upgraded to endangered by Birdlife International (Birdlife 2007), and the change will be reflected in the next update of the IUCN red list.

Apart from Fiordland&#x27;s Arthur Valley, there is only one other site in the South Island where brown teal live in the wild: since 2017, the Department of Conservation and Project Janszoon have released just under 300 of the waterfowl in the Awapoto River in Abel Tasman National Park. The birds are successfully breeding in that location.

<text>&quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year (commonly abbreviated to COTY) is an annual automotive &quot;Car of the Year&quot; award presented by &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine. The publisher claims that it is the world&#x27;s oldest continuous motoring award of its kind. The award is given to the best newly released vehicle each year.

==History==
Since 1963, &quot;Wheels&quot; has awarded the title of Car of the Year. In its inaugural year, the French Renault 8 became the inaugural COTY winner, which was built in many countries including Australia.

The original intention of COTY was to promote excellence in the Australian car manufacturing industry, dominated at the time by Ford, Holden, Chrysler, Datsun and Toyota. With the fuel crisis in the 1970s, European makers also based in Australia, such as Renault and Volkswagen, began closing their local assembly plants. With a shrinking local manufacturing base and reliability and quality issues that affected Australian-made cars, Wheels changed the basis of the award to include imported cars. At first, this was condemned by the local industry, unions and media, however, the approach permitted local products to be judged on a global basis. This, in turn, is claimed to have contributed towards a more competitive local industry and sees each winner heavily advertised as a COTY winner.

The award is given on an annual basis, except in 1972, 1979 and 1986 when, under the stewardship of the then-editor Peter Robinson, no newly released car in those years was considered worthy of the award.

The withholding of the award in 1972 and 1979 twice coincided with the release of a new Ford Falcon (the XA and XD series). On the second occasion, as the Falcon (XD) was a sales success and leading candidate for the 1980 COTY award, the then deputy manager of Ford Australia, Edsel Ford II, took out a 1-page advertisement in Wheels magazine, depicting the Falcon and other contenders as lemons and stating &quot;There are times when being a lemon is not a bitter experience at all&quot;. This was both in answer to the award&#x27;s withdrawal against the Falcon and Wheels&#x27; cover for March 1980, which was a four-wheeled lemon under the title &quot;NO CAR OF THE YEAR&quot;.

The first imported car to win the award was the Japanese Honda Accord for 1977. In 1982, the award was shared for the first time between badge engineered cars and, in 1991, between completely different types of cars. Over the years, the COTY criteria has been further refined and, for 2004, it was amended to allow any Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) to be eligible for the first time, permitting the Australian-made Ford Territory to take the title. For 2011, the Honda CR-Z instead became the first hybrid to win the award.

Starting from 2015, the temporal basis of how the award is branded has been changed such that, the award now carries the year of when the winner was announced, instead of the preceding year when testing took place. Consequently, what would have been the 2015 COTY winner is instead be the winner for 2016 and so forth.

== COTY winners ==
To date, in chronological order, the award winners (by name including series where available) have been the following:

<doc id="1241716" wikidata="Q373023" url="?curid=1241716" title="Weihai">
<text>Weihai (), formerly Weihaiwei (), is a prefecture-level city and major seaport city in the easternmost Shandong province of China. It borders Yantai to the west and the Yellow Sea to the east, and is the closest mainland Chinese city to South Korea (specifically, Chengshan to Yeonpyeongdo).

Compared with the 2,804,771 people in the 2010 Chinese census, there has been a total increase of 101,777 people over the past decade, an increase of 3.63%, with an average annual growth rate of 0.36%. Weihai&#x27;s population was 2,906,548 as of the 2020 Chinese census, of whom 1,164,730 lived in the current built-up (&quot;or metro&quot;) area of (Huancui District) even though Wendeng district to the south with 563,529 inhabitants is soon being conurbated. There are two county-level cities within Weihai; Rongcheng had a built up area with 714,211 inhabitants, while Rushan had 464,078 inhabitants in 2020.

== History ==

Prehistorically, it was inhabited by Dongyi tribes, and it was annexed into China proper by the state of Qi in 567 B.C.

Before the 14th century, Weihai was a minor fishing settlement. In 1398, during the Ming dynasty, it became a military stronghold (&quot;wei&quot;) to defend against raids by the wokou. The fortification at Weihai was constructed in 1403, and contained walls almost 2 miles (3.2 km) in circumference.

Weihaiwei was the base for the Beiyang Fleet during the Qing Dynasty. In 1895, the Japanese captured it in the Battle of Weihaiwei, which is regarded as the last major battle of the First Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese then evacuated Weihaiwei on 24 May 1898, after which it was occupied by the British.

The core of Weihai (now Huancui District) was ruled by the British from 1 July 1898 to 1930 under a lease agreement with the Chinese empire, with Port Edward (the center of the original Weihai city, now in Huancui District) serving as the capital. A Royal Navy base was built on Liugong Island.
Weihaiwei became an integral part of China after it was returned to the Republic of China on 1 October 1930, but Liugong Island and its facilities were leased back to the U.K. until 1940.

Weihaiwei was occupied by the Japanese from 1938 to 1945. There was a withdrawal of most British forces and supplies from Liugong Island, and finally a Japanese military landing and occupation of the island in 1940.

The region was formally incorporated into Shandong province on 10 May 1945. In 1949, Weihaiwei City was established, and its name was shortened to Weihai after the Communist revolution.

Since 2003, a replica of the Chinese battleship &quot;Dingyuan&quot; has been anchored here as a museum ship and memorial for Chinese veterans of the First Sino-Japanese War.

== Administrative divisions ==
The prefecture-level city of Weihai administers four county-level divisions, including two districts and two county-level cities.Weihai City has jurisdiction over two districts and two cities: Huancui District, Wendeng District, Rongcheng City, and Rushan City (Weihai Torch High tech Industrial Development Zone, Weihai Economic and Technological Development Zone, and Weihai Lingang Economic and Technological Development Zone are national level development zones, Weihai Nanhai Economic Development Zone is a provincial-level development zone, and the Development Zone Management Committee is a dispatched agency of the municipal government), with a total of 48 towns, 24 street offices, 2373 village committees, and 390 resident committees.

These are further divided into 66 township-level divisions, including 52 towns and 14 subdistricts.

== Geography and climate ==

Weihai is located on the northeastern shore of Shandong; its administrative area includes (), the easternmost tip of the Shandong Peninsula (Shantung Peninsula). The city is surrounded by sea on three sides; its port is protected by Liugong Island.

Weihai experiences a continental climate, and it is climactically influenced by the surrounding Yellow Sea and the Siberian high.Weihai City is located in the mid latitudes and belongs to the northern temperate monsoon continental climate, with significant seasonal changes and monsoon advance and retreat. Compared with inland areas at the same latitude, it has the characteristics of abundant rainfall, moderate annual temperature, and mild climate. Springtime warming and autumn cooling are delayed by one month, winds are generally high, and the average diurnal temperature variation throughout the year is small—at only . Winters are cold and dry, but still warmer than inland regions at the same latitude; the average temperature in January is . Summers are hot and humid, but much cooler than inland regions at similar latitude like the North China Plain (for about 5~10 °C) and August averages ; the annual mean is . More than two-thirds of the annual precipitation occurs from June to September, and there are nearly 2,540 hours of sunshine per year.

== Economy ==
Weihai is a commercial port and major fishing center with some light industries. Due to its close proximity to South Korea, Weihai also has a large Korean business community and receives many Korean tourists.In recent years, Weihai has vigorously implemented its urban internationalization strategy and deepened its opening-up and cooperation with South Korea in all aspects according to the concept of &quot;three exchanges, four ports, and five connections&quot;, becoming a model for local exchanges and cooperation between China and South Korea. Weihai is also a key production area for peanuts and fruit. Weihai has a good industrial foundation. A complete production system has been basically formed, with mechanical, electronic, chemical, building materials, light industry, textile and other industries as the pillars, and plastic, silk, medicine, food, arts and crafts and other industries as the backbone.

===Industrial Zone===
Weihai Economic &amp; Technological Development Zone is a state-level development zone approved by the State Council on 21 October 1992. The administrative area has an area of , including the programmed area of and an initial area of . The built-up area covers 42.3 square kilometers, governs 2 towns, 3 streets, 30 administrative villages and 50 communities, with a registered residence population of 175000 and a permanent population of 300000. Its nearest port is Weihai Port, and the airport closest to the zone is Dashuibo Airport.

Weihai Export Processing Zone (EPZ) was set up by the approval of the State Council on 27 April 2000. Weihai EPZ is located in Weihai Economic &amp; Technological Development Zone with programmed area of . Weihai EPZ belongs to comprehensive export &amp; processing zone. The EPZ is located from Weihai Airport, to Weihai Railway Station and from Weihai Harbor. As a new frontier of opening up to the outside world, the processing zone has focused on developing five major industries: electronic information industry, precision machinery manufacturing, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, new materials, and food processing industry.

Weihai Torch Hi-Tech Science Park is a state-level development zone approved by the State Council in March 1991. Located in Weihai&#x27;s northwest zone of culture, education and science, the Park has the total area of , a coastline of and 150,000 residents. It is away from the city center, away from Weihai Port, away from Weihai Railway Station, away from Weihai Airport and away from Yantai Airport.

<text>The &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year (COTY) is an annual &quot;Car of the Year&quot; award given by &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine to recognize the best new or significantly refreshed car in a given model year.

== Background ==
&quot;Motor Trend&quot;, which debuted in 1949, was the first publication to name a Car of the Year. The inaugural &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year award recognized Cadillac&#x27;s V8 engine in .

The earliest awards were given to the manufacturer or division, not for a specific vehicle. The 1958 Ford Thunderbird became the first single model to be selected. In 1970, the Ford Torino won the COTY while &quot;Motor Trend&quot; selected the Porsche 914 for its first Import COTY award.

In 1972, the low-volume imported Citroën SM won the overall COTY award. Between 1976 and 1999, the COTY award was split in two: &quot;Domestic COTY&quot; and &quot;Import COTY&quot;.

The trophy was recombined in 2000 because the distinctions between domestic and import cars became increasingly difficult. The award has expanded to include a pickup truck (starting in 1979) and a separate sport utility vehicle (starting in 1999), which are recognized separately from the Car of the Year.

Over time, other publications and organizations have copied Motor Trend&#x27;s Car of the Year award and created their own. These COTY designations may focus on regional markets, vehicle types, specific market segments, or other criteria. Some examples include the European Car of the Year that began in 1964 by a collective of automobile magazines, the Green Car of the Year selected by a panel of automotive and environmental experts, the Tow Car of the Year chosen by selected sponsors in the industry, and the Fleet Car of the Year that is voted by professional fleet managers.

==Impact==
&quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s Car of the Year is &quot;one of the most prestigious honors bestowed in the auto industry.&quot;

The trophy for the winner, a depiction of calipers, is often used in the winning automaker&#x27;s marketing and advertising. Most cars that win the award report a spike in sales.

==Criteria==
To be eligible for the award, a car must be an &quot;all-new&quot; or &quot;substantially upgraded&quot; vehicle that has been on sale within twelve months from the previous November, vehicles that have been on sale for over five years are ineligible for the award.

Between the contenders, it is not a comparison test. In 2014 as an example, the Motor Trend judges debated and evaluate each vehicle against six key criteria:

Motor Trend also only considers cars with base MSRPs less than $150,000 in order to avoid expensive luxury and super cars dominating the competition.

Vehicles are subjected to a battery of tests: standard car tests such as skid-pad ratings, acceleration and quarter-mile times, and evaluations of the interiors are combined with a track run conducted by Sports Car Club of America-licensed testers and taking the cars out on normal roads to test their drivability under normal conditions, and fuel economy. Trucks and SUVs add towing capacity and speed, plus an off-road course, to the normal regimen.

==Car of the Year Winners==
Note that in 1970 and between 1976–2000, the Car of the Year award was split into two categories, domestic and import.

==Import Car of the Year Winners==
Introduced in 1970 for one year and then brought back in 1976 due to differences between imports and American cars. The award was discontinued after the 1999 model year when the difference between what was a domestic and an import had started to become problematic.

==Truck of the Year Winners==
:

==SUV of the Year Winners==
&quot;SUV of the Year&quot; was split from &quot;Truck of the Year&quot; in 1999.

==Performance Vehicle of the Year Winners==
Motor Trend began their Performance Vehicle of the Year award in 2022.

==Car of the Year (China)==
&quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s China-market cousin, &quot;Auto Club-Motor Trend&quot;, also issues a &quot;Car of the Year&quot; award for that market.

<doc id="1241725" wikidata="Q290199" url="?curid=1241725" title="Bernier's teal">
<text>Bernier&#x27;s teal (Anas bernieri), also known as the Madagascar teal, is a species of duck in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. It is endemic to Madagascar, where it is found only along the west coast. Part of the &quot;grey teal&quot; complex found throughout Australasia, it is most closely related to the Andaman teal.
==Taxonomy==

The Bernier&#x27;s teal was first described by the German ornithologist Gustav Hartlaub in 1860 under the binomial name &quot;Querquedula bernieri&quot;. It is one of many dabbling ducks in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. It is one of the &quot;grey teals&quot;, a group of related ducks found across Australasia. DNA studies suggest that it may have been a sister species with Sauzier&#x27;s teal (which was found on the nearby islands of Mauritius and Réunion until it became extinct). Studies further suggest that its closest living relative is the Andaman teal, and confirm that it is related to the gray teal. There are no subspecies.

The duck&#x27;s common and species names both commemorate Chevalier Bernier, a French naval surgeon and naturalist who collected nearly 200 specimens of various species while stationed in Madagascar. The genus name &quot;Anas&quot; is a Latin word meaning &quot;duck&quot;.

== Description ==
This is a small duck, measuring in length, and ranging from in mass; males average slightly heavier than females. Adult and immature birds of both sexes look the same, though males are slightly larger than females. The plumage is predominantly warm brown. The bill is reddish, and the legs and feet are a dull reddish-orange.

==Range and habitat==
Bernier&#x27;s teal is endemic to the island of Madagascar, where it is found in mangrove forests. It rarely leaves this habitat, where it favors open shallow ponds and lakes, mostly brackish. Its range encompasses the whole of the west coast and the extreme north-east. It is known to breed at a few sites, central and north-west coasts. Subfossil evidence from the Holocene period shows that the teal formerly had a much wider distribution across the island.

== Behaviour ==

===Voice===
The male Bernier&#x27;s teal whistles, while the female&#x27;s call is described as &quot;a croaking &quot;quak&quot;&quot;.

===Diet and feeding===
Bernier&#x27;s teal typically spends much of its day actively feeding. It wades at the edge of shallow water, filtering mud and dabbling at the water&#x27;s surface. It feeds on invertebrates, plant materials, and insects.

===Breeding===
All known nests of wild Bernier&#x27;s teal have been found either above or close to water in grey mangrove trees, in holes above the water&#x27;s surface. In captivity, the species will also use nest boxes. The birds add no materials to the nest. Instead, the female lays her eggs directly on floor of the cavity, covering them initially with wood shavings or rotting bits of wood and later with down feathers from her own breast. In captivity, clutch sizes varied from 3 to 9, with an average of 6.75 eggs per female. The eggs are pale buff in colour, smooth and elliptical in shape, measuring on average. This is smaller than the eggs of any of the other &quot;grey teals&quot;. Only the female incubates the eggs.

== Conservation status ==
Bernier&#x27;s teal is on the verge of extinction. There are only about 1500 left in the world. The reason these ducks are on the verge of extinction is because their natural habitat, mangrove forests, are being destroyed for timber and fuel, and to expand cultivation. Hunting for food is also a threat.

The species is now held in wildfowl collections throughout the world, and several captive breeding programs exist. The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust on Jersey, for example, has reared nearly 100 since starting their breeding program in 1995. In the US, Sylvan Heights Bird Park in North Carolina and the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky have both successfully fledged ducklings.

<doc id="1241732" wikidata="Q5341753" url="?curid=1241732" title="Edward Ramsay">
<text>Edward Bannerman Ramsay, (17 January 1793– 27 December 1872), usually referred to as Dean Ramsay, was a clergyman of the Scottish Episcopal Church, and Dean of Edinburgh in that communion from 1841, has a place in literature through his &quot;Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character&quot;, which had gone through 22 editions at his death. It is a book full of the personality of the author, and preserves many traits and anecdotes.

==Life==

Ramsay was born in Aberdeenshire on 31 January 1793, the fourth son of Elizabeth Bannerman and Sir Alexander Ramsay, Baronet of Balmain and Fasque.

He spent much of his early life in Yorkshire, attending the Cathedral Grammar School in Durham from 1806. He then attended St John&#x27;s College at Cambridge University, graduating in 1815. He was then appointed curate of Rodden and of Buckland Dinham, Somerset. In 1824 he came to Edinburgh to serve as curate to St George&#x27;s on York Place before being appointed minister of St John&#x27;s Episcopal Church on Princes Street in 1830, where he then remained until death. This appointment followed the death of Bishop Daniel Sandford, founder of the church. His house from this period was a very large townhouse on the edge of the Moray Estate, 7 Darnaway Street, only five minutes walk from his church through Charlotte Square.

In 1838 he formed a new branch of the church, thereafter known as the Scottish Episcopal Church Society. In 1841 he was elected Dean of the Diocese of Edinburgh.

Over and above his religious activity he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1827, his proposer being Sir David Brewster. He served as the Society&#x27;s vice-president from 1859 to 1862.

He was also one of the founders of Glenalmond College.

He died at 23 Ainslie Place on the Moray Estate in Edinburgh on 27 December 1872. His memorial service was led by Rt Rev Henry Cotterill. He was buried in the eastern enclosure attaching the church.

His public memorial, an imposing 7.3m high Celtic cross in Shap granite with bronze sculpted panels, is on Princes Street in the grounds of St John&#x27;s, Edinburgh, facing Charlotte Street. It was designed by the architect Robert Rowand Anderson and built by Farmer &amp; Brindley of London. The bronze panels are by F. A. Skidmore. It was erected in 1879.

==Legacy==

The Episcopal Church still runs a charitable trust, The Dean Ramsay Fund, in his name.

==Publications==

He co-wrote &quot;Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character&quot; with his friend Cosmo Innes.

==Family==

<text>Farooq Abdullah (born 21 October 1937) is an Indian politician who serves as current president of the Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference. He has served as the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir on several occasions since 1982 till 2002, and as the union minister for New and Renewable Energy between 2009 and 2014. His father Sheikh Abdullah who was 1st elected chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, while his son Omar Abdullah is the current chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir. 
==Early life and education==
Farooq Abdullah was born to the veteran statesman and National Conference leader Sheikh Abdullah and Begum Akbar Jehan Abdullah. He studied at Tyndale Biscoe School, and subsequently received his MBBS degree from SMS Medical College, Jaipur. He subsequently travelled to the UK to practice medicine.

==Family==

He is married to Molly, a nurse of British origin. They have a son, Omar, and three daughters, Safia, Hinna, and Sara. Their son Omar Abdullah is also involved in state and national politics, and is the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir. Sara was married to Congress leader Sachin Pilot, but they divorced in late 2023.

==Political career==
===Entry into politics===
At that time his father Sheikh Abdullah was the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir. Farooq 
Abdullah was elected to the Lok Sabha unopposed as a founding party member of the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference from Srinagar Lok Sabha constituency in the 1980 General Election.

===Chief Minister, 1982–1984===
Abdullah was a novice in the political arena of Jammu and Kashmir when he was appointed president of the National Conference in August 1981. His main qualification was that he was the son of Sheikh Abdullah. After his father&#x27;s death in 1982, Farooq Abdullah became the chief minister of the state. In 1984, a faction of the National conference led by his brother-in-law Ghulam Mohammad Shah broke away, leading to the collapse of his government and his dismissal. Shah subsequently became the Chief Minister with the support of the Congress.

===1984–1996===
In 1986, G.M. Shah&#x27;s government was dismissed after the communal 1986 Kashmir riots in South Kashmir, and a new National Conference–Congress government was sworn in with Abdullah as the chief minister, after the Rajiv-Farooq accord.

A new election was held in 1987 and the National Conference–Congress alliance won the election amid allegations of fraud and widespread election rigging by the National Conference. This period saw a rise in militancy in the state, with the return of trained militants in J&amp;K and incidents that included the kidnapping of the daughter of the Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. The period also witnessed the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from the Kashmir valley. Subsequently, Farooq Abdullah resigned in protest after Jagmohan was appointed the governor, and the state&#x27;s assembly was dismissed.
He subsequently moved to the United Kingdom.

=== Chief Minister, 1996–2002===
After returning to India, and winning the Legislative Assembly elections in 1996, Abdullah was once again sworn in as chief minister of the state, his fifth time. His government lasted for a full six-year term. In 1999, the National Conference joined the Atal Bihari Vajpayee led National Democratic Alliance, and his son Omar Abdullah was subsequently appointed a union minister of state for External Affairs.

=== Subsequent political career===
In the 2002 Legislative Assembly elections, Omar Abdullah was chosen to lead the National Conference, while Farooq Abdullah intended to continue his political career at the Central level. The National Conference lost the election and a coalition government headed by Mufti Mohammad Sayeed took office. On that year Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2002 promised to make Abdullah the vice-president, but later reneged on his promise because of Abdul Kalam&#x27;s nomination to President and Krishan Kant&#x27;s disagree.

Farooq Abdullah was subsequently elected to the Rajya Sabha in 2002 from Jammu and Kashmir and re-elected in 2009. He resigned from the Rajya Sabha in May 2009 and won a seat in the Lok Sabha from Srinagar. Abdullah joined the United Progressive Alliance government as a Cabinet Minister of New and Renewable Energy.

Abdullah contested the Srinagar Lok Sabha seat again in the 2014 General Election, but was defeated by the People&#x27;s Democratic Party candidate Tariq Hameed Karra. In 2017, Tariq Hameed Karra resigned from the position, leading to a by-election for the Srinagar parliamentary seat. Abdullah got 48,555 votes and defeated PDP candidate Nazir Ahmed Khan by 10,700 votes.

On 16 September 2019, Abdullah became the first mainstream politician to be detained under the Public Safety Act. Prior to this, Abdullah was under house arrest since the scrapping of Article 370 of the Constitution of India. He was released from house detention under the PSA after seven and a half months on 13 March 2020.

In 2022, before the election of the President of India, Mamata Bannerjee along with several other opposition leaders had proposed Abdullah&#x27;s name as the Opposition&#x27;s candidate. But Abdullah declined the offer stating that he wanted to remain in active politics for more years and concentrated on the Kashmir Union Territory issue.

=== 370 Hearing ===

After his son Omar Abdullah, Farooq Abdullah made his presence in the Supreme court of India in relation to Article 370 hearing.

<doc id="1241738" wikidata="Q3524954" url="?curid=1241738" title="Thomas Buchanan Read">
<text>Thomas Buchanan Read (March 12, 1822 – May 11, 1872) was an American poet and painter. His portraits 
include many famous individuals including Robert Browning, Joseph Harrison Jr., William Henry Harrison, Abraham Lincoln, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Alfred Tennyson.

He first achieved national prominence in Cincinnati, Ohio. He studied under sculptor Shobal Vail Clevenger and opened an art studio sponsored by wealthy horticulturist Nicholas Longworth. He chafed under criticism from Longworth and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where he befriended poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and painter Washington Allston. He moved to Rome, Italy, and opened a studio, but achieved most of his artistic success while living in Florence, Italy. He was briefly associated with the Pre-Raphelite Brotherhood. He returned to the United States during the American Civil War and served as a major in the Union Army.

His most well known poem, &quot;Sheridan&#x27;s Ride&quot;, depicts Union General Philip Sheridan&#x27;s charge at the Battle of Cedar Creek during the American Civil War. Read gave recitations of the poem to the public and troops to build support for the war in the North. The poem&#x27;s popularity also prompted the creation of several paintings by Read depicting the scene.

==Early life and education==
Read was born on March 12, 1822, in Corner Ketch, a hamlet near Downingtown, Pennsylvania. He received only an elementary school level of education. After the death of his father, he apprenticed with a local tailor then moved to Philadelphia and worked as a grocer and tobacconist. At age 15, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, to live with his sister. He worked painting signs and apprenticed under sculptor Shobal Vail Clevenger. He also worked as an actor impersonating female roles due to his slight build.

==Career==

In Cincinnati, Read established a portrait studio with the assistance of the wealthy horticulturist Nicholas Longworth. In 1840, he gained national prominence through his portrait of Whig presidential candidate William Henry Harrison. He also published his first poetry collection in the Cincinnati Chronicle and Times. He parted ways with Longworth due to criticism of his work. In 1841, he moved to Boston, Massachusetts, and became friends with poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and painter Washington Allston. Longfellow hired Read to paint a portrait of his daughters which is considered one of his best works.

In 1843, he published a series of poems in the Boston Courier which later became the basis for the book &quot;Lays and Ballads&quot;.

In 1846 he moved backed to Philadelphia and in 1850, he moved to Rome, Italy, where he opened a studio and achieved success in art and literature. He returned to the United States in 1861 at the outbreak of the American Civil War and joined the Union Army. He served as a major on the staff of General Lew Wallace and gave public performances of his war songs to rally the Union troops. After one such performance, future president General James A. Garfield wrote to Read and thanked him for &quot;the pleasure of hearing your words&quot;.
His most famous poem is &quot;Sheridan&#x27;s Ride&quot; which depicts Union General Philip Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry charge at the Battle of Cedar Creek during the American Civil War. It was printed in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; on election day 1864 on the front page and may have impacted the margin of victory for Abraham Lincoln. The work proved so popular, he was asked by Union League of Philadelphia to create a painting of the subject matter. He ended up making several copies of the painting, 17 of which still exist.

President Ulysses S. Grant purchased the painting of &quot;Sheridan&#x27;s Ride&quot; with the intent to hang it in the White House. It remained with the Grant Family until 1939, when it was donated to the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution.

His portrait work also includes Robert Browning, Joseph Harrison Jr., Abraham Lincoln, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Alfred Tennyson, and the Queen of Naples. Over the course of his career, he produced 60 significant paintings from studios in the United States, Düsseldorf, Florence, Liverpool, London, Manchester and Rome.

Read also wrote a prose romance, &quot;The Pilgrims of the Great St. Bernard&quot;, and several books of poetry, including &quot;The New Pastoral&quot;, &quot;The House by the Sea&quot;, &quot;Sylvia&quot;, and &quot;A Summer Story&quot;. Some of the shorter pieces include &quot;Drifting&quot;, &quot;The Angler&quot;, &quot;The Oath&quot;, and &quot;The Closing Scene&quot;. Read was briefly associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His greatest artistic popularity took place in Florence, Italy where he was colleagues with other writers and artists such as Joel Tanner Hart, Hiram Powers, George Sand, and Frances Milton Trollope.

In 1871, Read sustained serious injuries from a carriage accident and never fully recovered. He returned to the United States in 1872 but contracted pneumonia during the journey and died soon after arriving at port in New York City. He was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

==Personal life==
In 1843, Read married Mary J. Pratt and together they had three children. During a trip to Italy in 1853, his wife and daughter died due to illness. He was remarried in 1867 to Harriet Dennison.

==Legacy==

Three of his paintings are held in the collection of the Cincinnati Art Museum - &quot;The Harp of Erin&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;Portrait of an Old Man&quot;. His painting of Longfellow&#x27;s children is in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art and a self-portrait is in the Washington National Gallery of Art. The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts has two of his paintings in their collection: a portrait of Joseph Harrison Jr. and &quot;The Flight of the Arrow&quot;.

In 1908, the Thomas Buchanan Read School in the Elmwood Park neighborhood of Philadelphia was named in his honor.

In 1922, the Chester County Historical Society erected a historical marker near the home where Read was born.

<text>Mikołaj Radziwiłł, nicknamed the Red (Polish &quot;Rudy&quot;, Lithuanian: &quot;Radvila Rudasis&quot;, Belarusian: &quot;Мікалай Радзівіл Руды;&quot; 1515 – 27 April 1584), was a Polish-Lithuanian nobleman, voivode of Vilnius, Grand Chancellor of Lithuania (since 1566), and Grand Lithuanian Hetman (1553–1566 and since 1576) in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and later in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Together with his cousin Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; Radziwiłł and the Radziwiłł family were granted title and position as Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.

His father was Jerzy Radzwiłł, called &quot;Victor,&quot; a Lithuanian hetman. His mother was Barbara Kolanka, daughter of voivode of Podolia Paweł Kola, a representative of a wealthy Małopolska family. His sisters were Anna and Barbara, later the wife of Polish King Sigismund Augustus.

Mikołaj Radziwiłł received, not the best, home education. His first language was Polish, which he used on a daily basis. He also knew Ruthenian, the official language in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He read and wrote in both Polish and Ruthenian, although his handwritten letters are written in illegible and careless handwriting, indicating the magnate&#x27;s low level of calligraphy. He did not know Latin, or knew it at a completely rudimentary level. The education was supplemented by service at the royal court in Kraków. Radziwiłł himself did not value university education highly, and did not send his sons to university, limiting their training to home education.

In 1532, Mikołaj was betrothed to the daughter of Grand Crown Chancellor Krzysztof Szydłowiecki, Anna. The marriage never occurred, as the bride died in 1536 before reaching marriageable age. Mikołaj&#x27;s first participation in public life was in the Lithuanian-Moscow War of 1534 at his father&#x27;s side.

Mikołaj Radziwiłł spent many years as a military commander. One of his most notable victories was achieved at the head of the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army during the Battle of Ula of 1564 when his forces defeated Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s much larger forces. Under King Stephen Báthory, he was fairly successful in defending the eastern borders of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania against the Muscovy.His political career was marked by his alliance with his cousin Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; Radziwiłł with whom he opposed the other notable Lithuanian families in the rivalry for the dominant status in the Great Duchy. The alliance marked the formation of a dynastic-like cooperation between Radziwiłłs and showed how family interests could affect magnates relations with the Commonwealth.

Mikołaj Radziwiłł became an advocate of Lithuanian sovereignty and thus a vocal opponent of the political Polish–Lithuanian union at Lublin in 1569. Unlike the other magnates, he refused to sign the Act as harmful to the interests of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

He was one of the most prominent converts and advocates of Protestantism in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and his line of the family became devoted members and defenders of the Lithuanian Evangelical Reformed Church until its extinction.

He was immortalized in the epic poem &quot;Radivilias&quot; (1592).

<text>Clara Reeve (23 January 1729 – 3 December 1807) was an English novelist best known for the Gothic novel &quot;The Old English Baron&quot; (1777). She also wrote an innovative history of prose fiction, &quot;The Progress of Romance&quot; (1785). Her first work was a translation from Latin, at the time a language unusual for a woman to learn. She was a near-contemporary of the bluestockings ladies of Elizabeth Montague&#x27;s circle.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Clara Reeve was born in Ipswich, one of the eight children of Reverend William Reeve MA, Rector of Freston and of Kirton, Suffolk, and perpetual curate of St Nicholas, Ipswich. Her mother was the daughter of William Smithies, a goldsmith and jeweller to King George I. Vice-Admiral Samuel Reeve (c. 1733–1803) was her brother.

Reeve described her father and her early life in a letter to a friend: 

===Career===
After the death of her father in 1755, Reeve lived for a time with her mother and sisters in Colchester, then moved into her own house in Ipswich. There her first piece of authorship was a translation from Latin of the historical allegory &quot;Argenis&quot; by John Barclay, which she entitled &quot;The Phoenix&quot; (1772). She was saddened by the reception her translation received, later writing, &quot;It was the best book I ever gave to the public, and the worst received.&quot;

Reeve published at least 24 volumes over a 33-year career as an author. They included five novels, of which only &quot;The Champion of Virtue&quot; and &quot;The Old English Baron&quot; (1777) became well known. The latter was written in imitation of &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; or as a rival to it. The two have often been printed together. The first edition, entitled &quot;The Old English Baron&quot;, was dedicated to the daughter of Samuel Richardson, who is said to have helped Reeve to revise and correct it. It would have a noticeable influence on Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818).

Reeve also wrote an epistolary novel, &quot;The School for Widows&quot; (1791), followed by &quot;Plans of Education&quot; (1792), whose focus was on issues of female education. Her innovative history of prose fiction, &quot;The Progress of Romance&quot; (1785), can be seen as a precursor to modern histories of the novel. It specifically upholds the tradition of female literary history heralded by Elizabeth Rowe (1674–1737) and Susannah Dobson (died 1795). One story in the work, &quot;The History of Charoba, Queen of Egypt&quot;, inspired Walter Savage Landor&#x27;s first major piece, &quot;Gebir&quot; (1798).

Reeve seems to have managed her publishing career personally, rather than relying on male relations to deal with publishers on her behalf.

===Death===
Reeve led a retiring life and left little biographical material. She died in Ipswich and was buried, as she wished, in the churchyard of St Stephen&#x27;s, next to her friend the Reverend Derby.

===Influence===
Written in response to Walpole&#x27;s &quot;Castle of Otranto&quot;, &quot;The Old English Baron&quot; was a major influence on the development of Gothic fiction, gaining popularity for the genre in universities and among general readers. A contextual introduction that looks at Reeve in the context of late 18th-century women&#x27;s writing and the history of the Gothic can be found in this book. Henrietta Mosse was to use this story as a model for her own novel, &quot;The Old Irish Baronet&quot; in 1808.

Although Reeve&#x27;s &quot;The Progress of Romance,&quot; was long overlooked by scholars, Garry Kelly has called it &quot;not only a pioneering history and defense of &quot;romance&quot; from antiquity to the mid-eighteenth century but also a ground- breaking work of literary scholarship by a woman&quot;.

Reeve&#x27;s contribution to developing Gothic fiction can be demonstrated on at least two fronts. First there is the reinforcement of the Gothic narrative framework as one that focuses on expanding the imaginative domain to include the supernatural, but without losing the realism that marks the novel that Walpole pioneered. Secondly, Reeve also sought to find an appropriate formula for ensuring that fiction is believable and coherent. She spurned specific aspects of Walpole&#x27;s style, such as his tendency to blend in humour or comedy that diminishes the Gothic tale&#x27;s ability to induce fear. In 1777, Reeve enumerated Walpole&#x27;s excesses: a sword so large as to require an hundred men to lift it; a helmet that by its own weight forces a passage through a court-yard into an arched vault, big enough for a man to go through; a picture that walks out of its frame; a skeleton ghost in a hermit&#x27;s cowl...Although successive Gothic writers did not fully heed Reeve&#x27;s emotional realism, she posited a framework that keeps Gothic fiction within the realm of the probable. This remained a challenge for authors after publication of &quot;The Old English Baron&quot;. Beyond its providential context, the supernatural often risked veering towards the absurd.

<text>Thomas Mayne Reid (4 April 1818 – 22 October 1883) was an Irish British novelist who fought in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). His many works on American life describe colonial policy in the American colonies, the horrors of slave labour, and the lives of American Indians. &quot;Captain&quot; Reid wrote adventure novels akin to those by Frederick Marryat (1792-1848), and Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894). They were set mainly in the American West, Mexico, South Africa, the Himalayas, and Jamaica. He was an admirer of Lord Byron. His novel &quot;Quadroon&quot; (1856), an anti-slavery work, was later adapted as a play entitled &quot;The Octoroon&quot; (1859) by Dion Boucicault and produced in New York.

While Reid&#x27;s novels have become almost completely forgotten in the Anglosphere, they have remained popular in Eastern Europe and particularly in Russia (ever since the Czar of Russia / House of Romanov imperial dynasty of the Russian Empire), being considered a part of the canon of Western literature and being published under the category of &quot;World Classics&quot; along with Jack London and James Fenimore Cooper.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Reid was born in Ballyroney, a hamlet near Katesbridge, County Down, in present-day Northern Ireland, the son of Rev. Thomas Mayne Reid Sr., a senior clerk of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, and his wife. His father wanted Reid to become a Presbyterian minister, and in September 1834 the youth enrolled at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. He stayed for four years, but lacked motivation to complete his studies and graduate. He headed back to Ballyroney to teach at a school.

In December 1839 Reid boarded the &quot;Dumfriesshire&quot;, bound for New Orleans, Louisiana, arriving in January 1840. He soon found a job as a corn factor&#x27;s clerk in the corn market. After six months in New Orleans, he is said to have left for refusing to whip slaves. Reid later used Louisiana as the setting of one of his successful books, an anti-slavery novel entitled &quot;The Quadroon&quot; (1856).

Reid travelled to Tennessee, where on a plantation near Nashville he tutored the children of Dr. Peyton Robertson. Some twenty years later, Reid would make mid-Tennessee the setting for his novel &quot;The Wild Huntress&quot;. After Robertson&#x27;s death, Reid founded a short-lived school in Nashville.

In 1841 he found work as a clerk for a provision dealer in either Natchez, Mississippi, or Natchitoches, Louisiana (the latter seems likelier). Although Reid later claimed to have made several trips West in this period, on which he purportedly based some of his novels, the evidence for this is sketchy and confusing at best.

===Literary career===
In late 1842 Reid arrived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he began writing prose and poetry for the Pittsburgh &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; under a pen-name, the Poor Scholar. He also apparently worked as a carrier for the paper. His earliest verifiable work is a series of epic poems called &quot;Scenes in the West Indies&quot;.

In early 1843, Reid moved to Philadelphia for three years, working as a journalist and periodically publishing poetry in &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;, &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Ladies National Magazine&quot; and elsewhere, still using his Pittsburgh pseudonym. There he met Edgar Allan Poe, who became a drinking companion for a time. Poe would later call Reid &quot;a colossal but most picturesque liar. He fibs on a surprising scale but with the finish of an artist, and that is why I listen to him attentively.&quot;

When the Mexican–American War began in the spring of 1846, Reid worked as a correspondent for the &quot;New York Herald&quot; in Newport, Rhode Island. He set one of his novels here. At this time, he added the pen-name Ecolier to the Poor Scholar.
On 23 November 1846, Reid joined the First New York Volunteer Infantry as a second lieutenant, leaving by ship with the regiment in January 1847. They camped for several weeks at Lobos Island before joining Major General Winfield Scott&#x27;s invasion of Central Mexico, which began on 9 March at Vera Cruz. Reid as Ecolier was a correspondent for a New York paper, &quot;Spirit of the Times&quot;, which published his &quot;Sketches by a Skirmisher&quot;. On 13 September, at the Battle of Chapultepec, Reid received a severe thigh wound while leading a charge. He was afterward promoted to first lieutenant for bravery in battle. On 5 May 1848 he resigned his commission and in July returned to New York with his regiment.

&quot;Love&#x27;s Martyr&quot;, Reid&#x27;s first play, was staged at the Walnut Street Theater, Philadelphia, for five nights in October 1848. He published &quot;War Life&quot;, an account of his army service, on 27 June 1849.

Learning of the Bavarian Revolution, Reid headed for England to volunteer, but after the Atlantic crossing changed his mind and went home to Ireland instead.

He soon moved to London and in 1850 published his first novel, &quot;The Rifle Rangers&quot;. This was followed by &quot;The Scalp Hunters&quot; (1851; dedicated to Commodore Edwin W. Moore, whom he met in 1841), &quot;The Desert Home&quot; (1852), and &quot;The Boy Hunters&quot; (1853). The last, set in Texas and Louisiana, was a &quot;juvenile scientific travelogue&quot; that become a favourite with young Theodore Roosevelt, who became a Reid fan. That year Reid married 15-year-old Elizabeth Hyde, daughter of his publisher, G. W. Hyde, an English aristocrat and his wife.

After time off with his new bride, Reid returned to writing. He continued to base his novels on his adventures in America. Several more were successful: &quot;The White Chief&quot; (1855), &quot;The Quadroon&quot; (1856), &quot;Osceola&quot; (1858) and &quot;The Headless Horseman&quot; (1865). He spent money freely, including building in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, a sprawling &quot;Rancho&quot;, a reproduction of a Mexican hacienda he had seen during the Mexican–American War, where he took to farming. This extravagance led to bankruptcy in November 1866, from which he was discharged in January 1867. That October he left London for Newport, Rhode Island, hoping to repeat his past success in the U.S.. He returned to New York in 1867 and founded the &quot;Onward Magazine&quot; there.

===Last years===
Reid lectured at Steinway Hall in New York and published the novel &quot;The Helpless Hand&quot; in 1868, but his popularity had declined in America. His wound from Chapultepec started to bother him and he was hospitalized for several months at St Luke Hospital in 1870. His wife hated the United States. After he was released from the hospital, they returned to England on 22 October 1870, to live at Ross on Wye, Herefordshire.

In England, Reid continued to write stories and reworked some earlier novels. &quot;The Death Shot&quot; was published in the &quot;Penny Illustrated Paper&quot;. In October 1874, an abscess formed on the knee of his wounded leg, leaving him unable to walk without crutches. He was joint editor with John Latey of &quot;The Boys&#x27; Illustrated News&quot; for ten months from 6 April 1881. He wrote and published in it &quot;The Lost Mountain; a Tale of Sonora.&quot;

About this time Reid&#x27;s creative energy began to flag and he lost popularity, so he turned to farming near Ross in Herefordshire. He continued to write. His last novel, &quot;No Quarter&quot;, set in the Parliamentary wars, and his last boys&#x27; book, &quot;The Land of Fire&quot;, were published after his death on 22 October 1883. 
He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, now part of London. His tombstone quotes from &quot;The Scalp Hunters&quot;: &quot;This is &#x27;weed prairie&#x27;; it is misnamed: It is the Garden of God.&quot;

==Influence and legacy==

Books such as the &quot;Young Voyagers&quot; were highly popular, especially with boys. His tales of the American West were also popular with children across Europe and Russia. Many became popular in Polish or Russian translations, including &quot;The Rifle Rangers&quot; (1850), &quot;Scalp Hunters&quot; (1851), &quot;Boy Hunters&quot; (1853), &quot;War Trail&quot; (1851), &quot;Boy Tar&quot; (1859), and &quot;Headless Horseman&quot; (1865/6). Several Russian and Polish writers have noted the influence of his works in their childhoods.

For instance, Vladimir Nabokov recalled &quot;The Headless Horseman&quot; as a favourite adventure novel of his boyhood – &quot;which had given him a vision of the prairies and the great open spaces and the overarching sky.&quot; At age 11, Nabokov translated &quot;The Headless Horseman&quot; into French alexandrines. Alexander Bek mentions the well-read K. K. Rokossovsky, future Marshal of the Soviet Union, referring to Reid&#x27;s work in early 1942. The Polish writer Czesław Miłosz cites Russian translations of Reid as well-remembered early reading matter, by which he also learned Russian and the Cyrillic alphabet. A chapter on Reid appears in his essay collection &quot;Emperor of the Earth&quot; (1976). Anton Chekhov in &quot;Island, a Journey to Sakhalin&quot; (1893–94) mentions &quot;Mayne Reid&quot; in Chapter 10: &quot;The morose, angry sea has spread itself boundlessly for thousands of versts. When a little boy has been reading Mayne Reid and his blanket falls off during the night, he starts shivering, and it is then that he dreams of such a sea.&quot;

United States President Theodore Roosevelt, in his autobiography, credits Reid with being a major early inspiration. The shy, asthmatic upper-class boy, Teddy Roosevelt, grew up to pursue naturalistic zoology and adventure travel. Russell Miller, in his biography of Arthur Conan Doyle, credits Reid as one of the writer&#x27;s favourite childhood authors and a great influence on his writings.

While almost completely forgotten in the Western world, Reid&#x27;s novels are popular in Russia and Eastern Europe, being considered a part of Western literature canon and published under the category of &quot;World Classics&quot; (along with Jack London and Fenimore Cooper).

Although Reid called himself and is listed often as Captain, Francis B. Heitman&#x27;s definitive &quot;Historical Register and Dictionary of the U.S. Army&quot; shows he only reached the rank of lieutenant.

<text>Stuart Richardson (born 15 August 1973) is a Welsh musician. He is the bassist for the rock band No Devotion, formed by former members of Lostprophets with Geoff Rickly of Thursday. He is also the touring bassist for Thursday.

==Career==
Richardson is an only child. His mother worked in a butchers shop, bar and doctors office, and his dad was a miner. Richardson has said that one of his earliest musical obsessions was David Bowie. He was inspired to learn to play bass by Steve Harris of Iron Maiden.

Richardson&#x27;s career in the music industry started off in the mid 1990s, working as a producer in his local area in Wales. By the late 1990s he was working as an engineer at Front Line Studios in Caerphilly, which is where he first met the other members of Lostprophets. He replaced Mike Lewis as bassist in Lostprophets after Mike switched to rhythm guitar, joining them in 1998 just before they recorded their third demo. He had worked with the band previously, having produced their first two demos. Lostprophets were signed to Columbia Records and Visible Noise in 2000 and released five studio albums.

In October 2013, ten months after lead singer Ian Watkins was arrested and charged with multiple sexual offences, Richardson and the remaining members of the band announced that they could &quot;no longer make or perform music as Lostprophets&quot;. Six months later, they formed a new band, No Devotion, with Geoff Rickly as their new lead singer. The band have released two albums, &quot;Permanence&quot; (2015) and &quot;No Oblivion&quot; (2022).

During an appearance on the &quot;Sappenin&#x27; Podcast&quot; with Sean Smith in December 2019, Richardson revealed the reason why they formed a new band. &quot;We didn&#x27;t catch our breath after the whole thing went down with [Watkins]. So I was like, well &#x27;fuck if that&#x27;s gonna be the thing that&#x27;s on my fucking gravestone.&#x27; Like &#x27;Oh, that guy was in that band with that fucking prick.&#x27; It&#x27;s like, fuck that. I&#x27;m gonna do my own band immediately.&quot; During the same interview, Richardson revealed that he had engaged in a violent altercation with Watkins in 2012, as the latter&#x27;s drug use put much strain on his relationship with the remaining band members prior to his conviction.

Richardson has been the touring bassist of Thursday since 2017.

==Personal life==
He is the co-owner of Rocky Water Studios, a studio based in the Eau Gallie Arts District of Melbourne Beach, Florida.

Richardson currently resides in Los Angeles, California, with his wife Marissa and their two daughters. He is currently endorsed by Orange Amplifiers.

<text>Sir Thomas Wemyss Reid (29 March 1842 – 26 February 1905) was an English newspaper editor, novelist and biographer.

==Early life==
Reid was born at Newcastle upon Tyne in 1842, the son of a Congregational minister

==Career==
He became chief reporter on the &quot;Newcastle Journal&quot; aged 19. His reporting of the Hartley Colliery disaster (1862) established his reputation regionally, and two years later he was appointed editor of the Preston Guardian. He was made London correspondent of the &quot;Leeds Mercury&quot; in 1867, becoming its editor three years later. He reminisced of the changes he had made to the working methods of the &quot;Mercury&quot;:
When I was appointed editor of the &quot;Leeds Mercury&quot; I was told that I need never trouble to come to the office in the evening. If I looked in during the afternoon, and wrote my leader and notes, I would do all that was necessary. In those days, the provincial daily editor did not think of forming a judgement of his own on current events. When the pile of London dailies came in, he would read their leaders and base his own on them. In that way he was always a day behind London. I tried to change all that. I was down in my office each night, and I wrote my leaders on the telegraphic news as it came in . When Charles Dickens died, the news came in about eleven at night, and we went to press at one. I wrote a leader on Dickens&#x27;s death, and that, I believe, was the only comment that appeared next day in any provincial daily on the matter. Other editors awoke to the fact that they, too, must no longer depend on London, and the old, easy-going times everywhere passed away.

He won the right for provincial newspapers to be admitted to the House of Commons press gallery and was (notes his entry in the &quot;ODNB&quot;) &quot;the first to establish a provincial paper as a real rival to the London press, in the quality of its news and comment, and in its access to behind-the-scenes information&quot;.
He held the editorship for seventeen years, until in 1887 he moved to London to become a director and general manager of Cassell &amp; Co, the London publishers, a post he held until his death. From 1890 to 1899, he was the editor-in-chief of the moderate Liberal magazine &quot;The Speaker&quot;.

He wrote a number of biographies, principally of W E Forster (a personal friend), and of Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton, but also including one of Charlotte Brontë. He also wrote a book on Tunisia, &quot;Land of the Bey&quot;, and a number of popular novels, including &quot;Gladys Fane&quot;.

On his death the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;, the Leeds-based rival of the &quot;Mercury&quot; described him as an inveterate political wire-puller who had known more about the formation of William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s administration in 1892 that anybody else outside the official circles. He was knighted in 1894.

Reid died in 1905 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. A former subordinate offered the following pen-portrait: His style, if direct and clever, was common place, and his manner of speech retained more than a suggestion of Northern provincialism. But at every point and in every situation he had a personality that impressed. He was self-willed, self-assured, and if provoked eminently combative. It was not by suavity alone that he made his way. He could fight, and I know that in politics at any rate he was a tolerably good hater. He was afraid of nobody. Rather below the medium height, without any particular graces of person or of address, he could hold his own anywhere. He talked well and unaffectedly, and in his eyes, which had a curious scintillating brightness, there ever seemed to lurk a shrewd and humorous patronage of all men and things.

==Writings==
Among his more permanent writings are:
* volume I, volume II - a compendium of short biographical character sketches of leading statesman and foreign premiers.
*&quot;The Land of the Bey&quot; (1882),
*&quot;Gladys Fane&quot; (1883),
*and Lives of William Edward Forster (1888), and Lords Houghton (1891), and Playfair (1899), and &quot;William Black, Novelist&quot; (1902).
He pronounced Heathcliff, from &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; &quot;the greatest villain of literature.&quot; (From &quot;A character study from &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; &quot;The Nassau Literary Magazine&quot; (1848–1908); Apr 1879; 34, 9; American Periodicals Series Online).

<doc id="1241750" wikidata="Q422228" url="?curid=1241750" title="Actinism">
<text>Actinism () is the property of solar radiation that leads to the production of photochemical and photobiological effects. &quot;Actinism&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek ἀκτίς, ἀκτῖνος (&quot;ray, beam&quot;). The word &quot;actinism&quot; is found, for example, in the terminology of imaging technology (esp. photography), medicine (concerning sunburn), and chemistry (concerning containers that protect from photo-degradation), and the concept of actinism is applied, for example, in chemical photography and X-ray imaging.

Actinic () chemicals include silver salts used in photography and other light sensitive chemicals.

==In chemistry==
In chemical terms, actinism is the property of radiation that lets it be absorbed by a molecule and cause a photochemical reaction as a result. Albert Einstein was the first to correctly theorize that each photon would be able to cause only one molecular reaction. This distinction separates photochemical reactions from exothermic reduction reactions triggered by radiation.

For general purposes, &quot;photochemistry&quot; is the commonly used vernacular rather than &quot;actinic&quot; or &quot;actino-chemistry&quot;, which are again more commonly seen used for photography or imaging.

==In medicine==
In medicine, actinic effects are generally described in terms of the dermis or outer layers of the body, such as eyes (see: Actinic conjunctivitis) and upper tissues that the sun would normally affect, rather than deeper tissues that higher-energy shorter-wavelength radiation such as x-ray and gamma might affect. Actinic is also used to describe medical conditions that are triggered by exposure to light, especially UV light (see actinic keratosis).

The term &quot;actinic rays&quot; is used to refer to this phenomenon.

==In biology==
In biology, actinic light denotes light from solar or other sources that can cause photochemical reactions such as photosynthesis in a species.

==In photography==
&quot;Actinic light&quot; was first commonly used in early photography to distinguish light that would expose the monochrome films from light that would not. A non-actinic safe-light (e.g., red or amber) could be used in a darkroom without risk of exposing (fogging) light-sensitive films, plates or papers.

Early &quot;non colour-sensitive&quot; (NCS) films, plates and papers were only sensitive to the high-energy end of the visible spectrum from green to UV (shorter-wavelength light). This would render a print of the red areas as a very dark tone because the red light was not actinic. Typically, light from xenon flash lamps is highly actinic, as is daylight as both contain significant green-to-UV light.

In the first half of the 20th century, developments in film technology produced films sensitive to red and yellow light, known as orthochromatic and panchromatic, and extended that through to near infra-red light. These gave a truer reproduction of human perception of lightness across the color spectrum. In photography, therefore, actinic light must now be referenced to the photographic material in question.

==In manufacturing==
Actinic inspection of masks in computer chip manufacture refers to inspecting the mask with the same wavelength of light that the lithography system will use.

==In aquaculture==
Actinic lights are also common in the reef aquarium industry. They are used to promote coral and invertebrate growth. They are also used to accentuate the fluorescence of fluorescent fish.

Actinic lighting is also used to limit algae growth in the aquarium. Since algae (like many other plants), flourish in shallower warm water, algae cannot effectively photosynthesize from blue and violet light, thus actinic light minimizes its photosynthetic benefit.

Actinic lighting is also a great alternative to black lights as it provides a &quot;night environment&quot; for the fish, while still allowing enough light for coral and other marine life to grow. Aesthetically, they make fluorescent coral &quot;pop&quot; to the eye, but in some cases also to promote the growth of deeper-water coral adapted to photosynthesis in regions of the ocean dominated by blue light.

==In artificial lighting==
&quot;Actinic&quot; lights are a high-color-temperature blue light. They are also used in electric fly killers to attract flies. The center wavelength for most actinic light products is 420 nanometers, with longer wavelengths regarded as &quot;royal blue&quot; (450nm) to sky blue (470nm) and cyan (490nm) and shorter wavelengths regarded as &quot;violet&quot; (400nm) and blacklight (365nm). Actinic light centered at 420nm may appear to the naked eye as a color between deep blue and violet.

<text>William Barnes Rhodes (1772–1826) was an English author, best known for his burlesque opera, &quot;Bombastes Furioso&quot;.

Rhodes was born in Leeds on Christmas Day 1772, the second son of Richard Rhodes and his wife, Mercy. He worked as a writer in an attorney&#x27;s office, before gaining a position as a clerk in the Bank of England around 1799. He was promoted to chief teller in 1823, and held that post until his death.

On 24 March 1825, Rhodes married Emma Millington. On 1 November 1826 he died at his home near Bedford Square, London, being survived by his wife, who gave birth to a daughter after his death.

Rhodes is best known as the author of a burlesque opera, &quot;Bombastes Furioso&quot;, which became a popular success. It was produced anonymously at the Haymarket Theatre on 7 August 1810, with John Liston in the title role and Charles Mathews as the King of Utopia and was first printed in 1813, in Dublin, but was not published under Rhodes&#x27;s name until 1822. He also published, in 1801, a translation into English verse of the Satires of Juvenal.

Rhodes was also a collector of dramatic literature and made large purchases when the Duke of Roxburghe&#x27;s library was auctioned in June 1812. Rhodes&#x27;s own library was sold by Sotheby&#x27;s in 1825.

<text>Captured Live at the Forum is the third album by American rock band Three Dog Night, released in 1969.

The album was recorded at The Forum in Los Angeles. According to &quot;Three Dog Nightmare,&quot; Three Dog Night opened this show in support of Steppenwolf, who were recording various shows on their 1969–70 tour for an upcoming live album (&quot;Steppenwolf Live&quot;, released 1970). Steppenwolf and Three Dog Night both recorded for the ABC/Dunhill label and shared the same production team, and it was decided to also record Three Dog Night on this occasion, despite the band&#x27;s having only released two prior albums. The choice paid off, as &quot;Captured Live at the Forum&quot; reached #6 on the Billboard album chart.

All the songs featured on &quot;Captured Live at the Forum&quot; were previously issued in studio versions by Three Dog Night. &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright&quot;, &quot;Eli&#x27;s Coming&quot;, and &quot;Easy to Be Hard&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Suitable for Framing&quot;, and the remainder on their eponymous first album.

Original pressings of the album bore the headline &quot;In front of an audience over 18,000 on September 12, 1969 in Los Angeles, Three Dog Night was Captured Live at the Forum.&quot; Future pressings would remove the date and lead singer Chuck Negron&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Three Dog Nightmare&quot; would subsequently list the concert&#x27;s performance date as July 14, 1969. However, September 12, 1969 is listed as the date of employment on the AFM contract filed for the event.

<text>Luxembourg has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 38 times since its debut at the first contest in . The Luxembourgish national broadcaster, (RTL), participates in the contest representing the country. The nation participated in all but one event between 1956 and , only missing the . After finishing among the bottom seven countries in 1993, Luxembourg was relegated and prevented from competing in . The nation declined to return to the contest in , and would make no further appearances over the next three decades. The country returned to the event for the first time in 31 years in .

With five wins, Luxembourg is one of the contest&#x27;s most successful nations, and between 1983 and 1994 the nation jointly held the record for most contest wins by a single country. Luxembourg won the Eurovision Song Contest in , with the song &quot; performed by Jean-Claude Pascal, in , with the song &quot; performed by France Gall, recorded back-to-back wins in and , when represented by &quot; by Vicky Leandros and &quot; by Anne-Marie David, and most recently in , with the song &quot;&quot; performed by Corinne Hermès.

In addition to its five wins, Luxembourg recorded two third-place finishes in and , and in total has placed within the top five 13 times and the top ten 20 times. Luxembourg&#x27;s fortunes in the contest changed in later years, with the nation&#x27;s final seven appearances in the 1980s and 1990s resulting in four placements in the bottom five, ultimately leading to the nation&#x27;s relegation and subsequent non-participation in 1993. On its return in 2024, Luxembourg qualified from the semi-finals and ultimately finished in 13th place in the final.

== Contest history ==
Participation in the Eurovision Song Contest is open to members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Between 1956 and 1993, (CLT) participated in the contest on behalf of Luxembourg; since 2024, , a division of the RTL Group, participates in the event representing the country.

One of seven countries to take part in the of the Eurovision Song Contest in 1956, Luxembourg has competed in the contest on 38 occasions since its debut entry. The nation participated in all but one event between 1956 and , with no Luxembourgish entry having participated in the . On each occasion that Luxembourg participated in the contest the country was represented by one song, with the exception of the first contest when each nation was represented by two songs.

Luxembourg has won the contest on five occasions, marking it as one of the contest&#x27;s most successful nations. The country&#x27;s first win was recorded in with the song &quot; performed by Jean-Claude Pascal. Four years later the nation were awarded a second victory, with the song &quot; performed by France Gall winning the contest in . Luxembourg recorded back-to-back victories in and becoming the second country to win the event in two consecutive eventswhen represented by the song &quot; performed by Vicky Leandros, and &quot; by Anne-Marie David, respectively. The nation achieved its most recent victory in , with the song &quot;&quot; performed by Corinne Hermès. With its fifth win Luxembourg became the joint-most successful Eurovision nation at that time, equalling the record for the most number of victories by a single country previously set by a record which would remain until recorded their sixth win in . All of Luxembourg&#x27;s winners, however, were not of Luxembourgish descent, with four of the five artists being French and one, Leandros, being Greek.

During its original participation run between 1956 and 1993 the rules of the contest for the majority of those editions stated that each country was required to perform in one of the national languages of that country. The large majority of Luxembourgish entries were performed in French, which is one of the official languages of Luxembourg and the main language of communication in the country, while Luxembourgish, the country&#x27;s national language, has featured in only three of the country&#x27;s entries, in , , and .

Including its five wins, Luxembourg has placed within the top five on 13 occasions and within the top ten on 20 occasions, including two third-place finishes in and . The majority of the country&#x27;s top placings, however, were recorded prior to its fifth contest win, and in the decade following its most recent victory Luxembourg&#x27;s fortunes in the contest began to shift, leading to four appearances in the bottom five between and 1993.

=== Relegation, absence and return ===
After finishing among the bottom seven countries at the 1993 event, Luxembourg was relegated under a new system to accommodate entries from new nations wishing to compete for the first time, and was thus prevented from participating in the 1994 contest. Luxembourg subsequently declined to participate in the and continued to be absent from the contest for three decades, with the increased costs of participating in the event cited as a main contributing factor for the country&#x27;s absence. Ahead of the Luxembourg was featured within a preliminary participants list for that edition, however, RTL subsequently reconsidered due to the scale of the participation fee, with Luxembourg ultimately absent from the final list of participating countries. RTL had been approached on several occasions in subsequent years about the possibility of returning to the contest and participation in the contest was the subject of discussion within the Luxembourgish parliament in the years following Luxembourg&#x27;s last entry, as well as the subject of fan-led petitions run both in Luxembourg and in other countries. The organisation however varyingly identified high participation costs, organisational difficulties, the cost and logistical issues of staging the event should Luxembourg win, format incompatibilities at the broadcaster, disinterest among the Luxembourgish viewing public and poor results towards the end of Luxembourg&#x27;s participation among the reasons future participation was consistently ruled out. In an interview with in April 2024, Luxembourgish singer revealed that he had been contacted by broadcaster San Marino RTV to create a duet that would represent both countries jointly in the contest. Despite the initial availability of Luxembourgish minister of Culture, the project was ultimately discarded for financial reasons.

On 15 December 2022, it was reported that Xavier Bettel, the Luxembourgish prime minister and minister for communications and media, had instigated discussions with RTL regarding the return of Luxembourg to the Eurovision Song Contest in , with a team within the Luxembourgish government formed to facilitate the country&#x27;s return to the event. On 12 May 2023, ahead of the final of the , the 30th anniversary of Luxembourg&#x27;s last entry and the 40th anniversary of Luxembourg&#x27;s last win, RTL and the EBU announced that Luxembourg would return to the contest in 2024. As part of the announcement RTL and the Luxembourgish government highlighted the promotion of Luxembourgish culture, the development of the cultural section of Luxembourgish society, as well as economic and touristic benefits which participation in the event could bring.

In July 2023, RTL launched its national selection process, with a televised final held on 27 January 2024 at the Rockhal in Esch-sur-Alzette. Interested artists were able to apply to compete in the event, with applicants required to be Luxembourgish citizens, long-term residents, or those with a proven connection to the Luxembourgish music scene and strong involvement with Luxembourgish culture. This marked a change from the majority of previous Luxembourgish Eurovision selections, which were predominantly held internally and were often led by the RTL organisation in Paris rather than by the local Luxembourgish broadcaster. As a result, a large number of the artists which represented Luxembourg at Eurovision were not of Luxembourgish descent, including all five of the nation&#x27;s winning artists. The &quot;Luxembourg Song Contest&quot; was officially launched on 1 December 2023, with RTL highlighting the event as a showcase for Luxembourgish talent and a platform for established and emerging artists within the Luxembourgish music scene. Following qualification to the final and a 13th place finish at the contest in Malmö, Sweden, David Gloesener, RTL&#x27;s Eurovision coordinator in Malmö, confirmed that Luxembourg would participate in the in Switzerland and work had already begun to determine its entrant, with the of the &quot;Luxembourg Song Contest&quot; held in January 2025 to select the nation&#x27;s representative for Basel.

== Participation overview ==


===&quot;Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest&quot;===

A special competition was held in October 2005 to celebrate the contest&#x27;s 50th anniversary, with 14 songs from Eurovision history competing to determine the most popular song from the contest&#x27;s first 50 years, with the winner determined through the combined votes of the viewing public and juries over two rounds. The contest was not relayed by a Luxembourgish broadcaster; however, Luxembourg&#x27;s winning song from 1965, &quot;&quot;, performed by France Gall, was featured among the 14 selected songs.

== Hostings ==
As is customary the winning broadcaster is offered the opportunity to organise the following year&#x27;s event, which has resulted in Luxembourg hosting the contest on four occasions. On each occasion the contest was held in Luxembourg City, and coincided with one of Luxembourg&#x27;s victories. The and events were held in the of and presented by Mireille Delannoy and Josiane Shen, respectively. The and contests were held in the (also known at the time as the and ) and presented by Helga Guitton and Désirée Nosbusch, respectively. Although Luxembourg won the contest in 1973 and were offered the opportunity to stage the , RTL declined the offer due to the financial strain of hosting two consecutive events, leading to the BBC to step in as organiser and staging the event in Brighton.

== Related involvement ==
===Heads of delegation===
Each participating broadcaster in the Eurovision Song Contest assigns a head of delegation as the EBU&#x27;s contact person and the leader of their delegation at the event. The delegation, whose size can greatly vary, includes a head of press, the performers, songwriters, composers, and backing vocalists, among others. At the 2024 contest the Luxembourgish Head of Delegation was Eric Lehmann.

===Conductors===
In contests where an orchestra was provided, a conductor was required to lead the musicians during each country&#x27;s performance. Broadcasters were able to provide their own conductors or could call upon the services of the conductor appointed by the host broadcaster. The conductors which led the orchestra during the Luxembourgish entries each year are listed below.

===Jury members===
Each participating broadcaster assembles a five-member jury panel consisting of music industry professionals for the Eurovision Song Contest, ranking all entries except their own. The modern incarnation of jury voting was introduced beginning with the , and , the juries&#x27; votes constitute 50% of the overall result in the final alongside televoting.

===Commentators and spokespersons===
RTL has broadcast the contest on various television and radio channels during its participation history and has provided commentary in different languages for the local audiences. On occasion commentary has been relayed from the broadcast feed of other participating countries. Between 1956 and 1991 the contest was broadcast on the French-language television channel of RTL (presently known as RTL9), and was also broadcast on the German-language television channel (previously known as &quot;RTL plus&quot;, now titled RTL) between 1984 and 1988; in 1992 and 1993 the contest was broadcast on the Luxembourgish-language channel RTL Hei Elei. The contest is also known to have been broadcast on RTL&#x27;s radio stations, in 1966 on the French-language Radio Luxembourg, in 1962 and 1973 on the Luxembourgish-language , in 1973 on the English-language Radio Luxembourg, and in 1979 on the German-language RTL Radio. Upon its return to the contest in 2024, RTL provided a wide array of broadcast options through television, radio and online streaming, with English, French and Luxembourgish language commentators recruited to provide context during the live shows.

As part of the contest&#x27;s voting procedure, each participating broadcaster nominates a spokesperson which announces the results of their country&#x27;s vote during the final. Since 1994 the spokespersons have been connected through satellite links, which replaced the use of telephone lines in previous events. Désirée Nosbusch, who had previously presented the , served as Luxembourg&#x27;s spokesperson upon the country&#x27;s return in 2024, and thus became the first Luxembourgish spokesperson to be seen in person during the contest.


===Creative directors===
As part of the broadcaster&#x27;s delegation team, a creative director may be employed to provide guidance on the staging of the competing entry at the Eurovision Song Contest. At the 2024 contest RTL collaborated with the Ukrainian director German Nenov on the staging of the Luxembourgish entry in Malmö.

<doc id="1241761" wikidata="Q6520344" url="?curid=1241761" title="Leitch Ritchie">
<text>Leitch Ritchie (1800–1865) was a Scottish novelist and journalist. He was born at Greenock and worked as a clerk in Glasgow, but about 1820 adopted literature as his profession.

Ritchie wrote four novels, of which the most successful was &quot;Wearyfoot Common&quot;. The others were &quot;Schinderhannes&quot;, &quot;The Robber of the Rhine&quot; and &quot;The Magician&quot;. In his later years he edited &quot;Chambers&#x27; Journal&quot;. He also wrote short stories, including one of the first British werewolf short stories &quot;The Man-Wolf&quot; (1831). Ritchie also wrote non-fiction works, such as travel books. 

==Life==
Ritchie was at first an apprentice in a banking office, but at an early age went to London with letters of introduction to literary people. Called back by his father, to take up a position in a Glasgow trading firm, he started in 1818, with some friends, a fortnightly publication, &quot;The Wanderers&quot;, which ran to 21 numbers (4 April 1818 to 9 January 1819). The Glasgow firm became bankrupt, and Ritchie again went to London.

Working as a professional writer, Ritchie sent articles to the &quot;Foreign Quarterly Review&quot;, the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;, and other periodicals. The &quot;London Weekly Review&quot;, on which he had been employed, passed into other hands, he and the former editor, James Augustus St. John, went to live in Normandy. Books made his reputation, and from this period he had enough work. In addition to his other engagements, he with William Kennedy, started a monthly periodical, &quot;The Englishman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which ran to seven numbers (April to October 1831), when his own illness caused its abandonment.

For some time Ritchie was editor of &quot;The Era&quot;, a sporting and dramatic newspaper, and was subsequently first editor of the &quot;Indian News and Chronicle of Eastern Affairs&quot; (No. 1, 11 June 1840), the copyright of which he was eventually given by the proprietor; and he later sold the newspaper. The latter part of his working life was spent in Scotland in editing &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Journal&quot;, and other publications by his employers. During this period (the 1850s) he lived at 29 St Bernards Crescent in Stockbridge, Edinburgh where he befriended his near neighbour, Andrew Crichton, of 33 St Bernard&#x27;s Crescent.

On 19 June 1862 Ritchie was granted a civil list pension. Retiring to London, he died at 1 Earlswood Terrace, East Greenwich, on 16 January 1865. He left a daughter, Mrs. Hughes, who resided at Perry Green, Hertfordshire.

==Works==

While contributing to periodicals in his early days in London, Ritchie brought out a volume entitled &quot;Head Pieces and Tail Pieces, by a Travelling Artist&quot;, 1820. He published also &quot;Tales and Confessions&quot;, 1829, and &quot;London Night Entertainments&quot;. Based in France, Ritchie produced &quot;The Game of Speculation&quot;, 1830, 2 vols. (reprinted in the &quot;Parlour Library&quot;, No. 58, 1851), and &quot;The Romance of History, France&quot;, 1831, 3 vols.; 2nd edit. 1872.

Charles Heath commissioned Ritchie to write two series of books of travels: &quot;Turner&#x27;s Annual Tour&quot;, 1833–5, and &quot;Heath&#x27;s Picturesque Annual&quot;, 1832–45. He visited many places abroad, and the result was twelve illustrated volumes to which he supplied the letterpress. He edited the &quot;Library of Romance&quot;, 1833–5, in 15 vols. 
Ritchie was also the author of:

* &quot;Schinderhannes, the Robber of the Rhine&quot;, printed in the &quot;Library of Romance&quot;, No. 2, 1833; reprinted in the &quot;Parlour Library&quot;, No. xiii. 1848, and as a separate volume 1878.
* &quot;The sea-wolf&quot;, printed in the &quot;Library of Romance&quot;, Vol. XI, 1834.

<text>Thomas William Robertson (9 January 1829 – 3 February 1871) was an English dramatist and stage director known for his development of naturalism in British theatre.

Born to a theatrical family, Robertson began as an actor, but he was not a success and gave up acting in his late 20s. After earning a modest living writing articles for the press, translating and adapting foreign plays and writing several of his own plays he achieved success in 1865 with his play &quot;Society&quot;, which the actor-manager Marie Wilton presented at a small London theatre, the Prince of Wales&#x27;s. Over the next five years Robertson wrote five more plays for the Prince of Wales&#x27;s. Their naturalistic style and treatment of contemporary social issues was in strong contrast to the melodramas and exaggerated theatricality to which the public had been accustomed, and Robertson&#x27;s plays were box-office and critical successes. Robertson supervised their productions and was a pioneer of modern stage directing.

Among later theatrical figures influenced by Robertson&#x27;s Prince of Wales&#x27;s plays and productions were W. S. Gilbert, Arthur Wing Pinero, Bernard Shaw and Harley Granville-Barker. Robertson wrote numerous plays for other theatres, and adapted many foreign plays for the English stage, but few of these made a strong or lasting impression. He strove successfully to improve the financial condition of dramatists, securing payment per performance, a basis that became the norm after his death.

Robertson suffered from heart disease and died at the age of 42 at the height of his fame and popularity.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Robertson was born in Newark-upon-Trent, Nottinghamshire on 9 January 1829. He came from a long-established theatrical family, active on the English stage since the early 18th century, and was the eldest son of William Shaftoe Robertson and his wife, Margharetta Elisabetta (&quot;née&quot; Marinus), a Danish-born actress. Robertson senior had been articled to a lawyer, but abandoned the law to become an actor, and was taken on by his uncle&#x27;s Lincoln Circuit Company, of which he afterwards became manager. Many of Robertson&#x27;s large family of siblings went on the stage, including his brothers Frederick and Edward, and his sisters Fanny, Elizabeth and Margaret, the last subsequently famous as Madge Kendal. He made his first appearance on the stage in June 1834 at the age of five as Hamish, the son of the title character in &quot;Rob Roy&quot;, and played roles including Cora&#x27;s child in Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;Pizarro&quot; and the Count&#x27;s child in Kotzebue&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger&quot;.

At the age of seven Robertson was sent to Spalding Academy, and then to a school in Whittlesey, acting with the family&#x27;s theatrical company during the school holidays. When he was about 15 his schooling ceased and he rejoined the company full-time, not only as an actor, but also, according to his biographer Michael R. Booth, &quot;as a scene painter, songwriter, playwright, prompter, and stage-manager&quot;. He wrote stage adaptations of Dickens stories for the company: &quot;The Battle of Life&quot; and &quot;The Haunted Man&quot;. Apart from a brief and unsuccessful spell in the Netherlands as an English teacher, he remained with the company until its disbandment in 1849.

===London===
Robertson moved to London, earning a meagre living, writing and taking such acting parts as he could get. His biographer T. Edgar Pemberton wrote, &quot;The amount of work that he did there during his early struggling days was prodigious. In addition to writing and adapting plays he contributed stories, essays, and verses to many magazines: dramatic criticisms to several newspapers: and ephemeral work to numerous comic journals&quot;.

In 1851 Robertson had a new play presented in the West End, &quot;A Night&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, a comic drama set in the time of the Jacobite rising of 1745. He hoped this would be start of a successful career as a dramatist, but the play was not a success, closing after four nights, and he continued to scratch a living as a writer and actor. Together with H. J. Byron, who became a close friend, he put on an entertainment at the Gallery of Illustration, without success. He worked as a prompter at the Olympic Theatre, tried unsuccessfully to join the army, and travelled to Paris with a company giving a season of English plays there. In 1855, while playing at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, he met a 19-year-old actress, Elizabeth Burton. They were married in July the following year; they had a son and three daughters. After their wedding the Robertsons toured Ireland before returning to act in London and the provinces. From 1858 Robertson, feeling that the life of a touring actor left no time for the serious business of writing plays, gave up acting and concentrated on writing.

Robertson&#x27;s farcical sketch &quot;The Cantab&quot;, staged as an after-piece at the Strand Theatre in February 1861, attracted the attention of a Bohemian literary set, and led to his becoming a member of the Savage, Arundel and Reunion Clubs, where, in the words of his biographer Joseph Knight, &quot;he enlarged his observation of human nature, and whence he drew some curious types&quot;. Among the up-and-coming writers with whom he mixed were F. C. Burnand, W. S. Gilbert, Tom Hood and Clement Scott. When Byron founded the magazine &quot;Fun&quot; in 1861, Robertson was a contributor from the outset. Writers for magazines and papers were seldom well paid, and to maintain a modest income Robertson wrote copiously: Pemberton lists a dozen publications to which he contributed in this period, ranging from &quot;Beeton&#x27;s Englishwoman&#x27;s Domestic Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Own Magazine&quot; to &quot;London Society&quot; and &quot;The Illustrated Times&quot;. Success remained elusive, and Robertson considered giving up writing and becoming a tobacconist.

===Success===

An important step to success came in 1864, when Robertson wrote &quot;David Garrick&quot;, an adaptation of Mélesville&#x27;s comedy &quot;Sullivan&quot;. Edward Sothern staged the piece and starred in it. The actor was at the height of his popularity, and although the notices paid more attention to his performance than to Robertson&#x27;s writing, the success of the production advanced the author&#x27;s career. Encouraged by this professional achievement, he wrote a new play, &quot;Society&quot;, a comedy depicting what one critic called &quot;the efforts of an illiterate millionaire to introduce his son into &#x27;society&#x27;, and the equally vigorous efforts of &#x27;society&#x27; to repel the intruder&quot;. This play was his breakthrough. London managements turned it down, but through Byron&#x27;s influence it was produced in Liverpool, where it was a critical and popular success.

Byron was a professional associate of Marie Wilton, who had recently taken over the management of one of London&#x27;s smaller theatres, the Prince of Wales&#x27;s. At his instigation &quot;Society&quot; was presented there on 11 November 1865. In a highly favourable notice the reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The piece was vehemently applauded from beginning to end. Success could not be more unequivocal&quot;. &quot;Society&quot; ran for 26 weeks – 150 performances – a notable run for the time, establishing the fortunes of the theatre, as well as those of the author. It was revived several times during the next two decades, and was given nearly 500 performances under Wilton&#x27;s (later the Bancrofts&#x27;) management. Between the Liverpool and London openings, Robertson suffered the loss of his wife, who died on 14 August after months of ill health.

Robertson wrote the libretto of the 1865 one-act comic opera &quot;Constance&quot;, with music by Frederic Clay. It was well reviewed when presented at Covent Garden, but ran only briefly, and Robertson did not return to the musical theatre. In 1869 Clay asked him for a second libretto, but he declined and instead gave Clay an introduction to &quot;a better man than I shall ever be&quot;, namely Gilbert, who collaborated with Clay on the successful &quot;Ages Ago&quot;.

The success of &quot;Society&quot; established Robertson as a playwright and enabled him to have a decisive voice in the staging of his subsequent plays. His next, the comedy &quot;Ours&quot;, was first given in August 1866 at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s, Liverpool, under his personal direction with a cast that included Wilton, Squire Bancroft (her future husband and partner) and John Hare. The play transferred to the Prince of Wales&#x27;s in London the following month and ran for 150 performances. &quot;The Times&quot; remarked on the &quot;ultra-real&quot; nature of the piece and of its staging.

===&quot;A complete reformation of the modern drama&quot;===
During the run of &quot;Ours&quot;, Robertson, Gilbert, Scott and others contributed short stories to a collection edited by Tom Hood. Robertson&#x27;s, &quot;The Poor-Rate Unfolds a Tale&quot;, formed the basis for his next play at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s, but before that he had two plays staged at other London theatres: &quot;Shadow-Tree Shaft&quot;, a drama, at the Princess&#x27;s, and &quot;A Rapid Thaw&quot;, an adaptation of a Sardou comedy, at the St James&#x27;s. In April 1867 his stage version of the short story opened at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s under the title &quot;Caste&quot;. In this piece Robertson developed the naturalistic, unexaggerated style for which he was becoming famous. Both as author and director he avoided the over-theatrical bombast of the early Victorian theatre. After the first night of &quot;Caste&quot; one critic wrote:

Gilbert, looking back in 1901, considered &quot;Caste&quot; Robertson&#x27;s masterpiece, a judgement with which analysts in the 20th and 21st centuries have concurred. The play ran for 156 performances and was revived for several further runs during the rest of the 19th century.

In 1867 Robertson remarried. His second wife was Rosetta Elizabeth Rodmill Feist (1844–1912), whom he had met at a party in London in 1866. They became engaged in August 1867, married at the British consulate in Frankfurt on 17 October, and honeymooned in Paris. They had a daughter and a son. Once back in London, Robertson continued to write and direct. In February 1868 &quot;Play&quot; was produced at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s. It ran for 106 performances and was followed by a successful revival of &quot;Society&quot;. In the same year Robertson adapted Alfred de Musset&#x27;s 1834 play &quot;On ne badine pas avec l&#x27;amour&quot; for his sister Madge. As &quot;Passion Flowers&quot; it was staged under Robertson&#x27;s direction at the Theatre Royal, Hull, and on tour.

Robertson had written &quot;Society&quot; with Sothern in mind, but the actor had been unavailable. In late 1868 Robertson adapted Émile Augier&#x27;s comedy &quot; L&#x27;Aventurière&quot;, presented at the Haymarket as &quot;Home&quot;, with Sothern in the lead role, and Ada Cavendish as Mrs Pinchbeck, in January 1869. It had a good run of 136 performances, but was outstripped by Robertson&#x27;s &quot;School&quot; – loosely based on Roderich Benedix&#x27;s &quot;Aschenbrödel&quot; – which opened at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s in the same month and ran for 381 performances.

===Last years===
Robertson&#x27;s last Liverpool premiere was on 22 February 1869. &quot;My Lady Clara&quot; was given at the Alexandra Theatre. The play was restaged in London on 27 March 1869 at the Gaiety Theatre, retitled &quot;Dreams&quot;. The London production featured Madge Robertson; it ran for 96 performances. Later in the same year &quot;A Breach of Promise&quot; (&quot;An Extravagant Farce&quot;) was staged at the Globe Theatre, London, and &quot;Dublin Bay&quot; (a &quot;comedietta&quot;) was performed at the Theatre Royal, Manchester.
In January 1870 Robertson was diagnosed as suffering from heart disease. He continued to write, and 1870 saw the production of &quot;Progress&quot; (adapted from Sardou) at the Globe, &quot;The Nightingale&quot;, a drama, at the Adelphi Theatre and his final work for the Prince of Wales&#x27;s – &quot;M. P.&quot;. Robertson was an early beneficiary of improved financial terms for playwrights; the practice of payment by royalties was not widespread until the 1880s, but the management of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s had paid him £1 a night for &quot;Society&quot; in 1865, and by the time of this final piece his nightly fee had risen to £5. He was also – most unusually for the period – paid for revivals. He was unable to supervise the production of &quot;M. P.&quot; or even to attend the first night. The company went to his house and gave him a private performance.

A comedy called &quot;Birth&quot; was presented by Sothern at the Theatre Royal, Bristol, followed by a provincial tour. Against medical advice Robertson attended the first night of a revival of &quot;Ours&quot; at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s on 26 November. The following month he travelled to Torquay on doctor&#x27;s orders, but found no improvement in his health and returned to London after two weeks. He was too ill to have any hand in the production of his last play, &quot;War&quot;, a drama staged at the St James&#x27;s Theatre on 16 January 1871.

Robertson died at his home in Chalk Farm, London on 3 February 1871, aged 42. He was buried in Abney Park Cemetery. More than a thousand people attended the funeral, including the entire company of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s, led by Marie Wilton, who placed a chaplet of flowers on the coffin. The theatre was closed that night in tribute to Robertson – an exceptional honour, according to &quot;The Times&quot;:
==Plays==

Robertson&#x27;s reputation rests on his series of plays for Marie Wilton&#x27;s company at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Theatre. They were seen as &quot;problem plays&quot;, because they dealt seriously and sensitively with social issues of the day. &quot;Caste&quot; was about marriage across the class barrier and &quot;Society&quot; explored prejudice against social mobility. The plays were notable for what the critic Thomas Purnell dubbed their &quot;cup and saucer&quot; realism, treating contemporary British subjects in settings that were recognisable, unlike the oversized acting in Victorian melodramas that were popular at the time. The characters spoke in normal language rather than declaiming their lines. Looking back thirty years later at the original production, Bernard Shaw called Robertson&#x27;s play &quot;Caste&quot; &quot;epoch making ... After years of sham heroics and superhuman balderdash, &quot;Caste&quot; delighted everyone by its freshness, its nature, its humanity&quot;.

Shaw was mistaken in supposing everyone was delighted: some critics wrote that there was nothing in Robertson&#x27;s plays but commonplace life represented without a trace of wit and sparkle, and absurdly realistic. More typical was the comment by a correspondent in &quot;The Era&quot; shortly after Robertson&#x27;s death, asking who else could &quot;successfully break, as he did, the trammels of conventionalism, and show us upon the stage living, breathing figures of flesh and blood, who walk, talk, act and think as tangible men and women really do in this work-a-day world of ours&quot;.

Some later analysts have disputed whether Robertson really originated some of the innovations attributed to him. In a 1972 study Errol Durbach suggests that &quot;the &#x27;revolution&#x27; had been initiated in France years before by Scribe and Sardou, those forerunners of the bourgeois domestic theatre and the well-made play&quot;. Durbach adds that in England, Vestris was staging plays &quot;with a scrupulous concern for realistic detail&quot;, and Bulwer Lytton was already writing &quot;the sort of play that would later be called &#x27;Robertsonian. Booth (2004) comments that Robertson &quot;was neither the herald of a new drama nor the apostle of a new realism, in spite of the claims of some of his successors and of later historians. He affirmed middle-class values rather than questioned them&quot;.

Although Robertson&#x27;s reputation as a revolutionary dramatist is debated, his importance in the development of modern stagecraft is generally agreed. Before him, star actors usually had control of scripts, and theatre managers had control of casting. Robertson insisted on retaining control over his scripts and casting and required that his actors follow his directions – a novel concept at that time. Dion Boucicault had been a forerunner, directing spectacular productions of his own plays, but Robertson applied the directorial precept to English domestic drama for the first time. Unlike Boucicault he did not act in his plays but applied himself exclusively to directing (or as it was called at the time &quot;stage management&quot;) and in that capacity he could focus on ensemble and balance. Gilbert attended Robertson&#x27;s rehearsals and later directed his own plays and operas based on what he had learned. He said of Robertson:

The actor-manager John Hare, who appeared under Robertson&#x27;s direction at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s, wrote:
As well as Gilbert, Hare and Shaw, leading theatrical figures who were influenced by Robertson included Arthur Wing Pinero and Harley Granville-Barker. The idealistic young playwright Tom Wrench in Pinero&#x27;s &quot;Trelawny of the &#x27;Wells&#x27;&quot; (1898) is an affectionate portrait of Robertson, of whom Pinero said, &quot;If it hadn&#x27;t been for Robertson I should never have been able to do what I have done, and that applies to the other fellows&quot;.

<doc id="1241763" wikidata="Q470882" url="?curid=1241763" title="Gopi Krishna (yogi)">
<text>Gopi Krishna (30 May 1903 – 31 July 1984) was an Indian yogi, mystic, teacher, social reformer, and writer. He was one of the first to popularise the concept of kundalini among Western readers. His autobiography Kundalini: The Evolutionary Energy in Man, which presented his personal account of the phenomenon of his awakening of kundalini, (later renamed &quot;Living with Kundalini&quot;), was published in Great Britain and the United States and has since appeared in eleven major languages. According to June McDaniel, his writings have influenced Western interest in kundalini yoga.

==Early life==
He was born in a small village outside Srinagar, in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. He spent his early years there, and later lived in Lahore, in the Punjab of British India.

== Career ==
At the age of twenty, he returned to Kashmir. During the succeeding years he secured a post in the state government, married and raised a family. Early in his career he became the leader of a social organisation that was devoted to helping the disadvantaged in his community, especially with regard to issues concerning the well-being and rights of women.

At the age of thirty-four, while meditating one morning, he reported to have experienced the sudden and forceful awakening of kundalini.

Gopi Krishna&#x27;s experience radically altered the path of his life. He came to believe that the human brain was evolving and that an individual&#x27;s profound mystical experience was a foretaste of what would eventually become an all-pervasive transformation in human consciousness. By his own account, Gopi Krishna&#x27;s initial experience triggered a transformative process that lasted for twelve years. During this time, the sensations of light, splendor and joy alternated with – and were often completely overshadowed by – sensations of fire, unbearable heat and bleak depression. In the introduction to Krishna&#x27;s book, Frederic Spiegelberg writes:

 &quot;Being exposed to Gopi Krishna&#x27;s experiences is like meeting a space traveller who seemingly for no purpose has landed on a strange and unknown star without the standard equipment of the professional astronaut, and who simply reports about the bewildering landscape around him, colorfully, truthfully, without really knowing exactly what he has found. We have here, in this wholly unintellectual personality, a classical example of a simple man, uneducated in Yoga, who yet through intense labour and persistent enthusiasm, succeeds in achieving, if not Samadhi, yet some very high state in Yoga perfection, based entirely on his inner feeling development and not at all on ideas and traditions. . . Lacking the guiding hand of a master, it is Gopi Krishna&#x27;s fate to be thrown from one despair into another, hectic ups-and-downs, the daily bread of this sensational experience. Like Faust, Na Ro Pa and many others, he finds a solution several times in his life only at the point of death. Even commonplace events take on an enormous character and lead him into depressions and dangers almost to the point of ruination. His own analysis of that situation is that the awakened Kundalini went up into the Pingala nadi instead of into the Sushumna nadi where it rightfully belongs. Where does all this lead him? To constant light-awareness, shimmering halo-consciousness but interrupted repeatedly by years of relapse and illness.&quot; 

Before his death in 1984 at the age of eighty-one, Gopi Krishna would write seventeen books on higher consciousness – three of them entirely in verse. He credited this output not to his own efforts but to inspiration from a higher source.

One of the lesser-known facts about Gopi Krishna&#x27;s life is that he was a crusader for women&#x27;s rights. Putting this in historical and cultural context shows how very extraordinary his dedication to this cause was. In 1930 it had been less than ten years since women had won the vote and the vast majority of the women in the world were still considered chattel. In India conditions for women were even worse and a man campaigning publicly for women&#x27;s rights would have been unheard of.

Gopi Krishna was reported to be a supporter for the equality of men and women. He acted, and at one point ended up imprisoned for his actions. One of his most far-reaching contributions involved bettering conditions for widows. At that time in India, the plight of a woman whose husband died was often horrific, especially if she had no grown children to help or protect her. The custom of sati (throwing oneself on the husband&#x27;s funeral pyre) though outlawed was still practised, particularly in remote areas.

Along with his humanitarian efforts, Gopi Krishna produced poetry and books in prose and verse form. But his main thrust over the years was to write about mystical experience and the evolution of consciousness from a scientific point of view – that there is supposed to be a biological mechanism in the human body, known from ancient times in India as kundalini, which is responsible for creativity, genius, psychic ability, religious, and mystical experience.

He chose the path of yoga due to his circumstances. His father renounced the world to lead a religious life leaving his twenty-eight-year-old mother with the responsibility of raising him and his two sisters. His mother now pinned all her hopes for success on her only son. Pandit Gopi Krishna was also a good freestyle wrestler and it is well known that he beat many a good wrestler. People who knew him well mention that he had the capability to be a world class wrestler, however, he spent most of his energy on intellectual pursuits.

But he failed to pass the examination to enter college, and he now took a lowly job and established his family. He also started on a discipline of meditation to discover who he was. After having been engaged in this for many years, he had his first kundalini experience at the age of 34, which he describes thus in his autobiography.

According to June McDaniel, his writings have influenced Western interest in kundalini yoga. He wrote many books and travelled all over the world giving lectures. He came to feel the kundalini experience underlies all (or most) religions that started with a personal revelation. He could see kundalini iconography in cultures worldwide, from ancient Egypt to Quetzalcoatl to the caduceus of Mercury, and believed there was a common basis, and that he had been granted entry to this vision. Gopi Krishna theorised that the brain was in a state of organic evolution, and that the rising of kundalini into the brain would open a normally silent chamber called brahma-randra in the yogic tradition. Krishna worked tirelessly to promote the scientific investigation of kundalini in the human frame, hypothesizing that this energy was leading humankind towards the goal of higher consciousness.

<text>Henry Crabb Robinson (13 May 1775 – 5 February 1867) was an English lawyer, remembered as a diarist. He took part in founding London University.

==Life==
Robinson was born in Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, as the third and youngest son of Henry Robinson (1736-1815) and Jemima (1736-1793), daughter of Denny Crabb, a landowner, maltster, and deacon of the congregational church at Wattisfield, Suffolk, and sister of Habakkuk Crabb.

After education at small private schools, he was articled in 1790 to an attorney in Colchester. At Colchester he heard John Wesley preach one of his last sermons. In 1796, he entered the office of a solicitor in Chancery Lane, London; but in 1798 a relative died, leaving Robinson a sum yielding a considerable yearly income. Proud of his independence and eager for travel, he went abroad in 1800. Between 1800 and 1805, he studied at various places in Germany, meeting men of letters there, including Goethe, Schiller, Johann Gottfried Herder and Christoph Martin Wieland. He then became correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; in Altona in 1807. Later on he was sent to Galicia, in Spain, as a war correspondent in the Peninsular War.

On his return to London in 1809, Robinson decided to quit journalism and studied for the Bar, to which he was called in 1813, and became leader of the Eastern Circuit. Fifteen years later he retired, and by virtue of his conversation and qualities became a leader in society. He was one of the founders of the London University (now University College London) and travelled several times to Italy, as many of his contemporaries did. Among those whom he befriended in Rome in 1829 was the novelist Sarah Burney.

Robinson died unmarried, aged 91. He was buried in a vault in Highgate Cemetery alongside his friend Edwin Wilkins Field. A bust of Crabb Robinson was made, and a portrait by Edward Armitage.

==Works==
Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Diary, Reminiscences and Correspondence&quot; was published posthumously in 1869. It contains reminiscences of central figures of the English romantic movement: including Coleridge, Charles Lamb, William Blake, William Wordsworth, and of other writers such as Sarah Burney. They are documents on the daily lives of London writers, artists, political figures and socialites. In his essay on Blake, Swinburne says, &quot;Of all the records of these his latter years, the most valuable, perhaps, are those furnished by Mr. Crabb Robinson, whose cautious and vivid transcription of Blake&#x27;s actual speech is worth more than much vague remark, or than any commentary now possible to give.&quot;
In 1829, Robinson was made a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (F.S.A.), and contributed a paper to &quot;Archæologia&quot; entitled &quot;The Etymology of the Mass&quot;.

His diaries were bequeathed to Dr Williams&#x27;s Library, because Robinson had been a member of the Essex Street Chapel, the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in England.

<text>William Roper ( – 4 January 1578) was an English lawyer and member of Parliament. The son of a Kentish gentleman, he married Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas More. He wrote a highly regarded biography of his father-in-law.

==Life==
William Roper the second was the eldest son of John Roper (d. 1524), Attorney-General to Henry VIII, and his wife Jane (died c.1544), daughter and coheir of Sir John Fyneux, Chief Justice of King&#x27;s Bench. The Ropers were an ancient Kentish family, owners of the manor of St Dunstan outside the West Gate of Canterbury, since known as the Roper Gate. He was educated at one of the English universities and the studied law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, being called to the bar in 1525. He was appointed Clerk of the Pleas in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, a post previously held by his father, holding the post until shortly before his death. Aged about twenty-three it is thought he joined the household of Sir Thomas More, marrying Margaret, More&#x27;s eldest daughter, in 1521. They lived together in Well Hall in Eltham, Kent.

Erasmus, who knew More and his family well, described Roper as a young man &quot;who is wealthy, of excellent and modest character and not unacquainted with literature&quot;. Roper became a convert to the Lutheran doctrine of Justification by Faith and spoke so freely of his belief that he was summoned to appear before Cardinal Wolsey on an accusation of heresy. More often disputed with Roper over his belief. He said to his daughter, To these prayers by More, Roper attributed his return to Catholicism.

Roper and his wife took in Margaret Throckmorton. She would become the prioress of St Monica in Leuven.

He was a member of various Parliaments (as MP for several constituencies including Rochester and Canterbury) between 1529 and 1558 and appointed High Sheriff of Kent for 1554–55. Although he remained a Roman Catholic, he was permitted to retain his office of prothonotary of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench after the accession of Elizabeth I. However, his diatribe against Elizabeth&#x27;s late mother, Anne Boleyn, in his biography of More earned him the enmity of many Elizabethan loyalists and Protestants.

His biography of Sir Thomas More was written during the reign of Mary I nearly twenty years after More&#x27;s death, but was not printed until 1626, when it became a primary source for More&#x27;s earliest biographers because of Roper&#x27;s intimate knowledge of his father-in-law.

==In popular culture==
Roper is an important character in Robert Bolt&#x27;s play &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;, portrayed as a contrarian who changes his views after arguing with More in order to marry his daughter. (In fact he had married Margaret More some years before the events depicted in the play and film.) After arguing theology with Roper, More says, &quot;They&#x27;re a cantankerous lot, the Ropers, always swimming against the stream. Old Roper was the same.&quot;

In the 1966 film adaptation, Roper was portrayed by Corin Redgrave.

<text>William Stewart Rose (1775–1843) was a British poet, translator and Member of Parliament, who held Government offices. From a Tory background, he was well-connected in the political and literary world, and made a mark by his championing of Italian poets and a burlesque style of verse based on their influence as satirists.

==Life==
Rose was born the second son of George Rose of Cuffnells near Lyndhurst in Hampshire, a senior civil servant and MP, and his wife Theodora Duer; George Henry Rose was his elder brother. He was educated at Hyde Abbey School under Charles Richards, and Eton College. He matriculated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1794, leaving without a degree, and entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1796. He was uncle to Hugh Rose, 1st Baron Strathnairn, Sir William Rose and the Countess of Morton.

Rose was successively appointed Surveyor of Green-wax Monies (1797–1800), Clerk of Pleas at the Exchequer (1797–1837) and Reading Clerk to the House of Lords (1800–1824). He was also the Member of Parliament (MP) for Christchurch from 1796 to 1800, partnering his father. His post as Clerk of Pleas was considered by William Cobbett to be a sinecure; and Nathaniel Wraxall saw Rose&#x27;s appointments as an example of his father&#x27;s nepotism. In any case Rose treated all his posts as sinecures.

In 1803 he became Major-Commandant of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s New Forest Rangers, one of the Volunteer corps formed after the breakdown of the Peace of Amiens. In 1809 the unit was incorporated into the South-West Hampshire Local Militia based at Romsey and commanded by the future Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, who was Secretary at War. Rose retained his position as major in the regiment.

During 1814–5 Rose travelled in continental Europe, while Napoleon was on Elba. On this trip he suffered an attack of apoplexy in Verona, reported in a letter of Countess of Albany to Ugo Foscolo, saying he had lost the use of one side, and had gone to the baths at Abano Terme. Rose helped Foscolo come to the United Kingdom in 1816, enlisting the support of Stratford Canning. In 1817 Rose went to the Veneto, for about a year.

Suffering a stroke in 1824, Rose retired on a pension from his House of Lords post. He suffered from paralytic attacks. In these years he lived in Brighton. He had London visitors, and a friend in the Rev. Charles Townsend (1789–1870), a minor poet, curate at Brighton then St Peter&#x27;s Church, Preston, from 1837 rector at Kingston-by-the-Sea: Townsend wrote the brief memoir for the 1864 edition of Rose&#x27;s Ariosto translation. Charles Macfarlane, an admirer who became a friend, met Rose at an evening in Brighton given by Horace Smith in 1827.

Henry Crabb Robinson&#x27;s diary records Rose at a breakfast given by Samuel Rogers, 6 January 1834: &quot;a deaf and rheumatic man, who looks prematurely old&quot;. Eventually there was a mental decline: according to Rogers, Rose was an imbecile by the time of his death in Brighton, on 29 April 1843.

==Associations==
In 1803 Rose met Walter Scott in London. They became friends, and it was through Rose that Scott came to know John Bacon Sawrey Morritt. Scott addressed to Rose the introductory poem of &quot;Marmion&quot; in 1808, from his house Ashestiel, Ettrick Forest.

Rose was associated with wits of the &quot;Anti-Jacobin&quot; circle, such as George Canning and John Hookham Frere, Tories who also gravitated to the group around the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;. They were interested in the burlesque aspects of Italian poetry. Another possible influence on Rose was John Herman Merivale, translator of Luigi Pulci.

Frere met Lord Byron in Seville in 1809; and Rose knew Byron from encounters in 1817–8 in Venice. &quot;&quot; was Byron&#x27;s 1818 poem which in terms of style and tone, and the use of &quot;ottava rima&quot;, owed something to the &quot;Whistlecraft&quot; Arthurian burlesque published by Frere, for Rose, as &quot;Prospectus and Specimen of an intended National Work&quot; (1817), and later (after expansion) known as &quot;The Monks and the Giants&quot; (1818). The digressive and satiric style was then worked out more completely in &quot;Don Juan&quot;. Byron understood that Rose was the author. Given the Tory provenance, from political opponents, of the &quot;Whistlecraft&quot; verse, Byron was as much provoked to competition as influenced.

Frere initially thought &quot;Beppo&quot; was by Rose. Rose, in his verse epistle to Frere, published 1834, called Frere &quot;father of his [Byron&#x27;s] final song&quot;, with a footnote:

In which I comprehend Beppo and Don Juan, and to warrant my assertion, it is fitting I should mention that Lord Byron made this avowal to me at Venice, and said he should have inscribed Beppo to him that had served him as a model, if he had been sure it would not have been disagreeble, supposing (as I conclude) that some passages in it might have offended him.

Despite his Tory background, and personal connection to followers of William Pitt the younger, Rose came to join the Holland House set of Whigs.

==Works==
Rose&#x27;s major work was the translation of the &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; of Ariosto, into English verse with notes, that he made in the years 1823 to 1831. The publisher John Murray II, seeing the success of &quot;Beppo&quot; as setting a new literary trend, commissioned the work, on which Rose had already made a start, for part publication. There was a later edition in the Bohn Library (1864, 2 vols.). Margaret Fuller told Charles Sumner in the 1840s that Rose&#x27;s translation, better than the one he had been reading by John Hoole, was in fact the best. A modern view calls it &quot;lumpen and over-literal&quot;, and it is not preferred to the Elizabethan version of John Harington.

&quot;The Court and Parliament of Beasts&quot; (1819), was a free verse translation from &quot;Gli Animali Parlanti&quot; of Giovanni Battista Casti. Philip Hobsbaum in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; called this animal tale Rose&#x27;s main claim to critical attention. It is divided into seven cantos, each prefaced by a personal dedication. The dedications were addressed, in order, to: Ugo Foscolo; John Hookham Frere (called &quot;our British Berni&quot;); his Hampshire house Gundimore; Henry Hallam; Bartholomew Frere; Sir Robert Ainslie, 1st Baronet; and Walter Scott. The 1819 edition by John Murray was preceded by a limited one, by William Bulmer (1816), which Rose may have shown Byron who knew the work by 1818.

Other works were:

* &quot;The Naval History of the Late War&quot; (1802, vol.1 only)
* A translation of &quot;Amadis de Gaul&quot; (1803). This was in rhymed verse, and a free and concise translation from the first three books of the French romance (from the Spanish) by Herberay des Essarts. Rose added notes, in the style of Gregory Lewis Way, editor of French &quot;fabliaux&quot;.
* A translation of &quot;Partenopex de Blois&quot; (1807), from the French of Pierre Jean-Baptiste Legrand d&#x27;Aussy. Benjamin Disraeli lampooned Rose in &quot;Vivian Grey&quot; as Partenopex Puff.
* &quot;The Crusade of St. Louis and Edward the Martyr&quot; (1810), ballads.
*&quot;Apology, or Anecdotes of Monkeys&quot; (1815)
* &quot;The Prospectus and Specimen of an Intended National Work&quot; (1817), pseudonymous. It was published for Rose by John Hookham Frere, as by William and Robert Whistlecraft. See above.
* &quot;Letters from the North of Italy&quot; (1819, 2 vols.), travel writing. The discursive letters were addressed to Henry Hallam. They include pro-Napoleon sentiments, and mention the satirical poet Giuseppe Parini.
* Translation into prose, with some verse passages, of the &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot; of Boiardo, from the Italian prose of Francesco Berni, 1823. This work amounted to a dry run for the &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; translation, and was prompted by Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland.
*&quot;Thoughts and Recollections by One of the Last Century&quot; (1825), essays, anonymous; contains an essay on translation.
* &quot;Epistle to the Right Honourable John Hookham Frere in Malta&quot; (1834), verse letter,
* &quot;Rhymes&quot; (1837)

Rose wrote five articles in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, in 1812–3 and 1826.

==Family==
From 1817, for around a year, Rose was in Venice, and there began in 1818 a relationship with a married woman, Countess Marcella Maria Condulmer Zorzi. She returned to England with him, and they lived as man and wife. After her husband had died, they were married in 1835, in Brighton, where they had settled. They had no children.

<text>Francis Rous, also spelled Rouse (c. 1581 to 1659), was an English politician and Puritan religious author, who was Provost of Eton from 1644 to 1659, and briefly Speaker of the House of Commons in 1653.

Stepbrother of Parliamentary leader John Pym, he joined him in opposing Arminianism in the Church of England, and played a leading role in the impeachment of Archbishop Laud. When the First English Civil War began in 1642, he supported the 1643 Solemn League and Covenant, and was appointed to the Westminster Assembly.

Under the Protectorate, he moved away from his Presbyterian colleagues, becoming closer to the religious Independents, and Oliver Cromwell. He died in January 1659, and was buried in Eton College Chapel.

==Biography==
Francis Rous was born at Dittisham in Devon around 1581, fourth son of Sir Anthony Rous (ca 1555-1620), and his first wife, Elizabeth Southcote (1547–1585). His father remarried Philippa Colles (died 1620), mother of John Pym; his stepbrother became a close friend and political ally.

At some point after 1601, he married Philippa, 1575 to 1657; their son Francis, (1615–1643), became a distinguished classicist and doctor, but was disinherited by his father for marrying without his approval.

==Career==

Sir Anthony Rous was a devout Puritan, who instilled the same values in his children. Francis was educated at Pembroke College, Oxford, then known as Broadgates, and known for its &quot;advanced Protestantism&quot;. In 1598, he moved to the University of Leiden, an important centre of study for Scots and English Calvinists.

As legal training was then considered part of an education, he attended the Middle Temple for a short period in 1601, but moved to Landrake, in Cornwall. There are few details of his life prior to 1626, although he produced several books, and Rous claimed in 1641 that he spent some of 1609 travelling in Europe with Sir Thomas Overbury, victim in one of the most famous murder cases of the period.

Understanding individuals from this period requires an appreciation of the centrality of religious belief in daily life, and politics. With the exception of Independents, who opposed any state church, most people believed in a &#x27;universal&#x27; church, where everyone belonged to the same structure, and used the same practices; where Charles I, William Laud, Rous and others disagreed was the form it took, particularly within the Church of England. It was taken for granted good government depended on &#x27;true religion&#x27;, and as many also believed the Second Coming was imminent, it gave debates on what that meant a real urgency and importance.

&quot;Puritan&quot; was a term for anyone who wanted to reform, or &#x27;purify&#x27;, the Church of England, the most prominent being Presbyterians. Most of these factions considered themselves part of the national church; those who were expelled by the 1662 Act of Uniformity became Nonconformists. Like John Pym, Rous was a passionate opponent of Arminianism; between 1619 and 1623, he published three works focusing on idolatry and &#x27;carnal gloriations&#x27; among the priesthood. 

In 1626, he was elected Member of Parliament for Truro, then Tregony in 1628. Rous and Pym led the attack on Roger Maynwaring and Robert Sibthorpe, two clergymen who published sermons supporting divine right of kings, and passive obedience. Essentially political arguments, they were seen as undermining the role of Parliament, and condemned as such. In a speech made in January 1629, Rous argued if Arminianism continued to spread, &#x27;true religion&#x27; was doomed; this inspired much of the subsequent opposition to Archbishop Laud. Charles responded by dissolving Parliament, initiating the period of Personal Rule that continued until 1640.

Returned for Truro in the elections of April and November 1640 Long Parliament, Rous opened the debate on the legality of Laud&#x27;s reforms in December 1640, and presented articles of impeachment against John Cosin in 1641. He sat in the Westminster Assembly, took the Solemn League and Covenant, and in 1644, became Provost of Eton College, a position he retained until his death in 1659.

In 1643, Rous published his metrical paraphrases of the Book of Psalms, &quot;The Psalms of David set forth in English meeter&quot;, to be used in the Churches of England and Scotland. His text was heavily edited by a committee of translators, and in 1650 his Psalms were approved for use by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Despite the extent of the revisions, Rous&#x27;s text for Psalm 23 is generally considered to be the basis of the popular Christian hymn, &quot;The Lord&#x27;s my Shepherd&quot;.

After 1647, Rous moved closer to the Independents like Oliver Cromwell, and supported Charles&#x27; execution in 1649; since Presbyterians believed a &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; monarchy was divinely mandated, The Protectorate presented a problem. In April 1649, he published a pamphlet titled &quot;The Lawfulness of Obeying the Present Government&quot;; claiming to be written by a &#x27;true Presbyterian&#x27;, this argued scripture required obedience to authority, regardless of who wielded it.

In early 1652, he served on the Committee for Propagation of the Gospel; led by Congregationalist minister John Owen, Parliament was dissolved before any of its suggested reforms were enacted. He was appointed Speaker of the House of Commons in 1653, although he proved incapable of managing the violent factionalism of Barebone&#x27;s Parliament. Along with Charles Worsley and John Lambert, Rous was increasingly disturbed by the radicalism of many MPs. In a pre-planned move, on the morning of 12 December 1653, he led moderate members to Cromwell&#x27;s office, where they resigned &#x27;their powers unto his Excellency&#x27;, effectively dissolving Parliament.

He was MP for Cornwall in 1656, along with Pym&#x27;s nephew, Anthony Nicholl, but rejected a seat in the newly created Upper House. His wife Philippa was terminally ill, and died in December 1657; Rous followed in January 1659. His will left £50 to his grandson, &#x27;so long as he shall be in preparation towards a profession&#x27;, and funded three scholarships for Etonians to attend Pembroke College. He was buried in Eton College Chapel.

<doc id="1241772" wikidata="Q6255788" url="?curid=1241772" title="John Row (minister, born 1568)">
<text>John Row (1568 – 26 June 1646) was a Scottish ecclesiastical historian and one of the Scottish Reformers. As minister of Carnock in Fife, he was a leading opponent of Episcopacy. Row&#x27;s &quot;Historie of the Kirk of Scotland&quot; (1558–1637), left by him in manuscript, is an original authority for the period. An account of his life is attached to the work.

Born Perth; his baptism is recorded as having taken place 6 January 1568–9. He was the third son of John Row, the Reformer, minister of Perth. John was educated by his father; he was so precocious that he knew Hebrew at the age of seven, and read daily after dinner or supper portions of the Old Testament in the original. On the death of his father in 1580, his brother William and he received friar&#x27;s pensions from the King&#x27;s Hospital at Perth. At fifteen he became schoolmaster of Kennoway and tutor to his cousins, sons of Beaton of Balfour, whom he accompanied to Edinburgh University in 1586. He graduated with an M.A. 1 August 1590. Shortly afterwards he was elected schoolmaster of Aberdour, and was tutor to William, Earl of Morton. He continued his studies in divinity, and towards the end of 1592 he was ordained to this Carnock. He was one of the forty-five ministers who signed a Protest to Parliament, 1 July 1606, against Episcopacy, and in the same year, at Linlithgow, he met with the ministers who were to be put on their trial for holding the Assembly at Aberdeen in disobedience to the King&#x27;s command. In 1616 he declined a presentation to Aberdour, and later, a call to Culross. In 1619, and again on 29 December 1621, he was summoned before the Court of High Commission for non-conformity and opposition to Prelacy. He was prevented by illness from obeying the former summons, but was represented by a son and a nephew. Sir George Bruce of Carnock also intervened on his behalf and sent a letter by one of his servants, Richard Christie, to the Archbishop. The Archbishop deposed two ministers but dealt more leniently with Row, who was simply &quot;confined to his own congregation.&quot; Richard Christie claimed as much credit for the light sentence as Row&#x27;s other friends: &quot;After sundry arguments, Christie came on with one weightie argument,&quot; saying, &quot;thir coals in your mines are very evil, and my master (Bruce) hath very many good coals: send up a vessel every year to Culross, and I shall see her laden with good coals.&quot; After Row had been restricted to his small parish he organised the Communion services which gave Carnock a celebrity among the parishes of Scotland. This it retained for upwards of two hundred years. At a Communion in 1635 it is said there were no fewer than seventeen tables. Row was a member of the Glasgow Assembly of 1638, when he was appointed one of a committee of ministers &quot;come to years&quot; to enquire— from personal knowledge of the handwriting of clerks and their own recollection of events — into the authenticity of certain Assembly Records which had been missing for some time, the result being that their genuineness was established. By the same Assembly he was named one of a committee for considering such constitutions and laws &quot;as might prevent corruptions in the future, like those which had troubled the Kirk in the past.&quot; He died on 26 June 1646.

==Life==
He was the third surviving son of John Row, a Scottish reformer, and Margaret Beaton of Balfour; he was born at Perth about the end of December 1568, and baptised on 6 January 1569. He received early instruction from his father, and at the age of seven was reading Hebrew. Sent to the grammar school of Perth, he instructed the master in Hebrew, who on this account was accustomed to call him Magister John Row.

On the death of his father in 1580, Row, then about twelve years of age, received, as did his brother William Row, a friar&#x27;s pension from the King&#x27;s hospital at Perth. Subsequently, he obtained an appointment as schoolmaster at Kennoway, and tutor to his nephews, the sons of Beaton of Balfour. He accompanied them in 1586 to Edinburgh, enrolling himself as student in the university. After taking his M.A. degree in August 1590, he became schoolmaster of Aberdour in Fife; he was towards the close of December 1592 ordained minister of Carnock, in the presbytery of Dunfermline.

Row signed on 1 July 1606 the protest of the Scottish Parliament against the introduction of episcopacy; and he was also one of those who in the same year met at Linlithgow with the ministers who were to be tried for holding an assembly at Aberdeen, contrary to the royal command. In 1619, and again in 1622, he was summoned before the court of high commission for nonconformity to the Articles of Perth, and required to confine himself within the bounds of his parish.

He was a member of the general assembly of 1638, when he was named one of a committee of ministers to inquire—from personal knowledge of the handwriting of the clerks and their own memory of events—into the authenticity of certain registers of the general assembly that had been missing for some time. He was able to establish their authenticity. By the same general assembly, he was also named to a committee to construct such constitutions and laws as might prevent corruptions like those that had troubled the kirk in the past.

He died on 26 June 1646, and was buried in the family burial-place at the east end of the church of Carnock, where there was a monument to his memory.

==Epitaph==

He died 26 June 1646, after a few days&#x27; illness, and was buried at the east end of Carnock Church, where a monumental stone was erected to his memory. This monument is surmounted by a Scottish thistle, immediately over which are the Hebrew words for &quot;The Last House,&quot; and the following Latin inscription: 

&quot;Hic Iacet M. Jo. Row, Pastor hujus ecclesise fidelissimus : vixit acerrimus veritatis et foederis Scoticani assertor : hierarchias pseudo-episcopalis et Romanorum rituum cordicitus osor : in frequenti symmistarum apostasia cubi instar constantissimus.&quot; 

In &quot;Memorials of the Family of Row&quot; there is to be found this other epitaph : 

Though bald with age, and prest with weight,
In crooked times this man went straight : 
His pen kept hid things on record
For which the Prelats him abhorr&#x27;d : 
And his Carnock, his little quarter
For Canterbury he would not barter.&quot;

==Family==
He married 4 January 1595 Grizel (died 30 January 1659), described as &quot;a verie comelie and beautifull young woman,&quot; daughter of David Fergusson, minister of Dunfermline, and had issue — 
*David, a minister in Ireland, &quot;who was obliged to return to Scotland after a residence of twenty-five years, fifteen of which he had spent in the ministry, with a wife and five children without means of support, because of persecution and oppression from Papists who burned, slew, and did all the hurt they could to those that fled not&quot;;

==Works==
*The Historie of the Kirk of Scotland from the year 1558 to August 1637, with a Continuation to July 1639 by his son John Row, Principal of King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen. [Row&#x27;s Historie, based on papers left by his father-in-law, David Fergusson, found its way into circulation by means of several manuscript copies, one of which — in Edinburgh University Library — was first printed by the Wodrow Society (Edinburgh, 1842), an edition being printed also that same year for the Maitland Club, 2 vols.

In his later years Row compiled a memorial of on the government of the Church of Scotland since the Reformation. For the earlier years of his &quot;Memorial&quot; he made use of the papers of his father-in-law David Ferguson. The work found its way into circulation in manuscript, and copies of it were made. In 1842 it was printed for the Wodrow Society, chiefly from a manuscript in the university of Edinburgh, under the title ‘Historie of the Kirk of Scotland, from the year 1558 to August 1637, by John Row, Minister of Carnock, with a Continuation to July 1639, by his son, John Row, Principal of King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen.’ An edition was also printed in the same year by the Maitland Club.

<text>The Westchester is an upscale shopping mall located in downtown White Plains, New York. It is operated by Simon Property Group, which owns 40% of the mall, and is home to many well-known retailers, some with their only location in Westchester County. It is anchored by Neiman Marcus, Crate &amp; Barrel, and New York State&#x27;s first Nordstrom, the fourth in the New York City metropolitan area to open after locations in Short Hills, Menlo Park, and Paramus, New Jersey.

==History==
Opened in 1995, The Westchester was built on the site of one of the first suburban branch department stores in the United States, a B. Altman &amp; Co. store which opened in 1930, as well as the terminal for the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway White Plains branch. B. Altman&#x27;s was located where Nordstrom is now situated. The mall was built adjacent to the (once) freestanding location of Neiman Marcus, which originally opened in 1972 as the only out-of-town location of its sister chain, New York-based Bergdorf Goodman. The Westchester is located within close proximity to the Sonesta Hotel (Formerly The Crowne Plaza Hotel), The Opus Westchester Hotel (Formerly The Ritz-Carlton Hotel), The Source at White Plains, The White Plains Pavilion, City Center at White Plains, and the now permanently closed Galleria at White Plains. The mall&#x27;s food court, located on the fourth floor, is known as Savor Westchester. The food court includes Melt Shop and Shake Shack. The fourth floor used to have a typical food court and a large F.A.O. Schwarz that closed in the early 2000s. Starting in February 2016, the mall underwent its largest renovation since opening in 1995, which included installing a new façade, tiling and carpeting.

<text>Franc Serafin Metelko, also known as Fran Metelko (14 July 1789 – 27 December 1860) was a Slovene Roman Catholic priest, author, and philologist, best known for his proposal of a new script for the Slovene called the Metelko alphabet, which was meant to replace the traditional Bohorič alphabet, used since the late sixteenth century.

Metelko was born in the village of Škocjan in Lower Carniola, then part of the Habsburg monarchy. He studied theology and philosophy in Ljubljana. In 1814 he was ordained a priest and in 1817 he started teaching Slovene at the Lyceum in Ljubljana.

In 1825, he published a book in German titled &quot;Lehrgebäude der slowenischen Sprache im Königreiche Illyrien und in den benachbarten Provinzen&quot; (Slovenian Textbook for the Kingdom of Illyria and Neighboring Provinces). Following the advice of the linguist Jernej Kopitar, his newly created alphabet (which soon became known as the &quot;metelčica&quot; &#x27;Metelko alphabet&#x27;) was phonetic, with each character corresponding a sound in the spoken language. It was also quite complicated, containing unneeded or redundant characters for glottal &quot;h&quot; and the clusters &quot;lj&quot;, &quot;nj&quot;, and &quot;šč&quot; as well as unfamiliar characters taken from Cyrillic. In addition, Metelko based his phonology on his local Lower Carniolan dialect, which was not acceptable for most contemporary Slovenian authors.

Metelko&#x27;s proposal further aggravated the &quot;Slovene alphabet War&quot;, which was started by Peter Dajnko&#x27;s quest for a new, more phonetic alphabet, replacing the traditional Bohorič alphabet (&quot;bohoričica&quot;). Metelko&#x27;s main opponent, the philologist Matija Čop, convinced the Czech scholar František Čelakovský to publish a devastating critique of Metelko&#x27;s alphabet, which undermined the chances of its success. Čop also persuaded the local Austrian educational authorities to ban Metelko&#x27;s alphabet from schools, which they did with an official decree in 1833. The Alphabet War nevertheless continued until the 1840s, when a slightly modified version of Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet was finally adopted, which is still used to this day.

Metelko&#x27;s alphabet remained in public memory because of a satirical poem by France Prešeren titled &quot;Al&#x27; prav se piše kaa ali kaſha&quot; (How to Write the Word Porridge), which criticized the Alphabet War as nonsense.

Metelko was also a collector of folk songs and an amateur poet. Metelko Street (), home to the Metelkova autonomous social and cultural centre in the center of Ljubljana, is named after him.

He died in Ljubljana.

<text>Samuel Rutherford (also Rutherfurd or Rutherfoord; – 29 March 1661) was a Scottish Presbyterian pastor and theologian and one of the Scottish Commissioners to the Westminster Assembly.

==Life==

Samuel Rutherford was born in the parish of Nisbet (now part of Crailing), Roxburghshire, in the Scottish Borders, about 1600. Nothing certain is known as to his parentage, but he belonged to the same line as the Roxburghs of Hunthill (from whom Sir Walter Scott was descended) and his father is believed to have been a farmer or miller. A brother was school-master of Kirkcudbright, and was a Bible Reader there, and another brother was an officer in the Dutch army.

Rutherford was educated at Jedburgh Grammar School and the University of Edinburgh. After graduating with an M.A. in 1621, he was appointed regent of Humanity at Edinburgh in 1623. He demitted that office in 1626, because of immoral conduct with Euphame Hamilton, who afterwards became his wife. He was admitted to Anwoth Kirkcudbrightshire, Galloway in 1627, probably without Episcopal sanction. It was said of him there that &quot;he was always praying, always preaching, always visiting the sick, always catechising, always writing and studying&quot;. One of his patrons in Galloway was John Gordon, 1st Viscount of Kenmure who died in 1644. His wife, Jane Campbell, Viscountess Kenmure, was a regular correspendent and a continuing supporter of him and his work.

In 1630 he was summoned before the Court of High Commission, but the charge of non-conformity was not persisted in. Mainly for his publication of a work against Arminianism he was again accused in 1636 by Bishop Sydserff, and after proceedings at Wigtown, was cited before the Commission and prohibited, 27 July, from exercising ministerial office, and ordered to reside in Aberdeen during the King&#x27;s pleasure. During this period he wrote most of his well-known Letters. His writing desk there was said to be, &quot;perhaps the most effective and widely resounding pulpit then in old Christendom.&quot;

In February 1638 Rutherford returned to Anwoth and attended the Glasgow Assembly that year as one of two commissioners from his Presbytery. Shortly afterwards he was elected one of the ministers of Edinburgh, but the Commission of Assembly appointed him, in preference, Professor of Divinity at St Andrews, which office he only accepted on condition that he should be allowed to act as colleague with Robert Blair, one of the ministers of St Andrews, 7 January 1639. He was a member of succeeding Assemblies and consistently supported the Covenanting Party therein. In 1643 he was appointed one of the four main Commissioners of the Church of Scotland to the Westminster Assembly and preached several times before Parliament, remaining in London for four years.

Rutherford was appointed to Principalship of St Mary&#x27;s College in St Andrews (later merging to become St Andrews University) in 1647 in place of Robert Howie. He was offered in 1648 a Divinity Professorship at Harderwyck in Holland, in 1649 the chair at Edinburgh, and in 1651 he was twice elected to a Professorship at Utrecht, but all these he declined. In 1643, 1644, 1650, and 1651 he was elected rector of the university, and in 1650 on Charles II.&#x27;s visit to St Andrews, he made a Latin speech to him on the duty of Kings. Rutherford was a staunch Protester during the controversy in the Scottish Presbyterian church between the Resolutioners and Protesters in the 1650s.

After the Restoration he was one of the first marked out for persecution: his work &quot;Lex Rex&quot; was ordered by the Committee of Estates to be burnt at the Crosses of Edinburgh and St Andrews by the hand of the common hangman, while the &quot;Drunken Parliament&quot; deprived him of all his offices and voted that he not be permitted to die in the college. He was cited to appear before Parliament on a charge of treason, but he died 29 March 1661 [the date — 20th — on his tombstone is an error]. He is buried in the churchyard of St Andrews Cathedral just west of the bell tower. The epitaph on his tombstone includes &#x27;Acquainted with Emmanuel&#x27;s Love&#x27;.

==Legacy==

One of the classical figures of the Church of Scotland, Rutherford&#x27;s influence during his lifetime, as scholar, preacher, and writer, was profound and wide, and after his death his name received a popular canonisation which it retains to this day. Some forty editions of his Letters have been reprinted (Bonar&#x27;s edition contains 365), and innumerable anecdotes of his sayings and doings are enshrined in, and constitute no inconsiderable part of the Scottish tradition. Among his last words were: &quot;Glory shines in Immanuel&#x27;s Land,&quot; on which Mrs Anne Boss Cousin founded her hymn, &quot;The Sands of Time are sinking.&quot;

There is also a monument to Rutherford, a Category B listed granite obelisk erected in 1842 on the hilltop overlooking his former parish at Anwoth, in the village of Gatehouse of Fleet, southwest Scotland.

==Family==
He married firstly in 1626, Euphame Hamilton, who died June 1630, and had issue — Marie, baptised 14 April 1628. He later married again on 24 March 1640, Jean M&#x27;Math, who was buried in Greyfriars Churchyard on 15 May 1675, and had issue — Agnes (married William Chiesley, W.S.), died 29 July 1694, and six others who predeceased him. He is known to have been friendly with James Guthrie.

==Writings==
Rutherford&#x27;s Letters have been both lionized and criticized. His English contemporary, Richard Baxter remarked that except for the Bible, “such a book as Mr. Rutherford’s Letters, the world
never saw the like” while nineteenth-century Baptist theologian Charles Haddon Spurgeon commented on Rutherford&#x27;s posthumously published &quot;Letters&quot; (1664) by saying, &#x27;when we are dead and gone let the world know that Spurgeon held Rutherford&#x27;s Letters to be the nearest thing to inspiration which can be found in all the writings of mere men&#x27;. Andrew Thomson, a Scottish minister, in a 19th-century biography observed &quot;the letters flash upon the reader with original thoughts and abound in lofty feeling clothed in the radiant garb of imagination in which there is everything of poetry but the form.&quot; He continues describing: &quot;individual sentences that supplied the germ-thought of some of the most beautiful spiritual in modern poetry&quot;. Elsewhere he talks of &quot;a bundle of myrrh whose ointment and perfume would revive and gladden the hearts of many generations&quot;. He also quotes that &quot;each letter, full of hope and yet of heartbreak, full of tender pathos of the here and the hereafter.&#x27; Rutherford was also known for other spiritual and devotional works, such as &quot;Christ Dying and drawing Sinners to Himself&quot;, &quot;The Trial and Triumph of Faith&quot;.

Rutherford&#x27;s political book &quot;Lex, Rex, or The Law and the Prince&quot; (1644) was written in response to John Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;Sacro-Sanctum Regus Majestas&quot; (1644) and raised Rutherford to eminence as a political thinker. It justified defensive wars and active resistance to lawfully constituted authority, and presented a theory of limited government and constitutionalism. After the Restoration, it was burned at Edinburgh and St. Andrews by the hand of the common hangman, and after his death it was put on the University of Oxford&#x27;s list of prohibited books. 

&quot;Lex Rex&quot; has sometimes confused commentators into thinking that Rutherford was in favour of civil liberty. Instead, Rutherford advocated the Two Kingdoms ideal of Church and State popularized in Scotland by Andrew Melville. This occurs in a number of his works, but can be seen most easily in the second half of his &quot;Due Right of Presbyteries&quot; (1644). While it forbade the king from holding an office in the Church, it also made him responsible for overseeing and enforcing the true religion. 

Not surprisingly, Rutherford was vehemently opposed to liberty of conscience. His &quot;A Free Disputation against Pretended Liberty of Conscience&quot; (1649) opposed the views of Roger Williams and others, and has been described as &quot;perhaps the ablest defence of persecution ever to appear in a protestant nation&quot; and as &quot;the ablest defence of persecution during the seventeenth century.&quot; It raised the ire of John Milton, who named Rutherford in his sonnet on the forcers of conscience in the Long Parliament. 

Rutherford was also a strong supporter of the divine right Presbyterianism (the idea that the Presbyterian form of church government is mandated in the Bible). He was involved in written controversies over church government with the New England Independents (or Congregationalists). His works in this area were &quot;A Peaceable Plea for Paul&#x27;s Presbytery in Scotland&quot; (1642), followed by the &quot;Due Right of Presbyteries&quot; (1644), the &quot;Divine Right of Church Government and Excommunication&quot; (1648) and &quot;A Survey of &#x27;A Survey of that Sum of Church Discipline&#x27; penned by Thomas Hooker&quot; (1655). New England Congregationalists responding to Rutherford included not only Thomas Hooker but also John Cotton and Richard Mather.

<text>George Sale (1697–1736) was a British Orientalist scholar and practising solicitor, best known for his 1734 translation of the Quran into English. In 1748, after having read Sale&#x27;s translation, Voltaire wrote his own essay &quot;De l&#x27;Alcoran et de Mahomet&quot; (&quot;On the Quran and on Mohammed&quot;). 

For &quot;A General Dictionary, Historical and Critical&quot;,
an English translation and enlargement of Pierre Bayle&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire historique et critique&quot;,
Sale supplied &quot;Articles relating to Oriental History&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Canterbury, Kent, he was educated at the King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, and in 1720 became a student of the Inner Temple. It is known that he trained as a solicitor in his early years but took time off from his legal pursuits, returning at need to his profession. Sale was an early member of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.

Sale became seriously ill with fever for eight days before his death. George Sale died at Surrey Street, The Strand, London, on 13 November 1736. Sale was buried at St Clement Danes in London. His family consisted of a wife and five children.

==The Quran==

In 1734, Sale published a translation of the Quran, The Koran: Commonly called The Alcoran of Mohammed, dedicated to John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville. Relying heavily on O.M.D. Louis Maracci&#x27;s Arabic edition and Latin translation, Sale provided numerous notes and a Preliminary discourse. Sale had access to the Dutch Church, Austin Friars&#x27; 14th-century manuscript of al-Baydāwī&#x27;s &quot;Lights of Revelation and the Secrets of Interpretation&quot;, and this seems the source for his Arabic Quran rather than his own personal Quran, catalogued &quot;MS Sale 76&quot; in the Bodleian Library.

Sale&#x27;s footnotes provide the literal translation where it differs from the idiom of the body text; he gives alternate variant readings; and supplementary historical and contextual information. Sir Edward Denison Ross added the Introduction to the 1922 reprint of Sale&#x27;s translation.

===Preliminary discourse===
Though he did not place Islam at an equal level with Christianity, Sale seemed to view Mohammad as a conqueror who sought to destroy idolatry and a lawgiver who managed to change and supplant many practices in Arabia:
Sale prefixed a Preliminary Discourse to his translation covering topics including Arabs &quot;before hijrah&quot;; the State of the Eastern Churches, and Judaism, at time of Mohammed; the Peculiarities of the Quran; positive and negative Doctrines and Instructions of the Quran; and political Islam in the 1730s.

Sale posits the decline of the Persian Empire on rivalry between the sects of Manes and Mazdak, and mass immigration into Arabia to escape persecution in the Grecian empire. In his eighth essay on False Prophecy, Sale notes Muslim Sects both Canonical (Maleci, Hanefites, Hanbali and Shafi‘i) and &quot;heretical&quot; (Shi&#x27;ism).

==Other works==
Sale was also a corrector of the Arabic version of the New Testament (1726) issued by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He acquired a library with valuable rare manuscripts of Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Arabic origins, which is now held in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

He assisted in the writing of the &quot;Universal History&quot; published in London from 1747 to 1768. When the plan of universal history was arranged, Sale was one of those who were selected to carry it into execution. Sale wrote the chapter, &quot;The Introduction, containing the Cosmogony, or Creation of the World&quot;. Critics of the time accused Sale of having a view which was hostile to tradition and the Scriptures. They attacked his account of cosmogony as having a view giving currency to heretical opinions.

His books:
* The Koran, First Edition, 1734. (ed. high resolution scans from the Posner Memorial Collection.)
* George Sale (Translator) and Claude Etienne Savary (illustrator), &quot;&quot;The Koran: Commonly Called the Alcoran of Mohammed&quot;. J.W. Moore, 1856. 670 pages
* George Sale, et al., &quot;Sacred Books of the East: With Critical and Biographical Sketches&quot;. Colonial Press, 1900. 457 pages
* Sale, George, Bower, Archibald and Psalmanazar, George; &quot;An Universal History, from the Earliest Account of Time&quot;. Millar, 1747.
* George Sale, &quot;Selections from the Koran of Mohammed&quot;. Priv. print. by N.H. Dole, 1904. 211 pages.
* George Sale, et al., &quot;Arabic Reading Lessons: Consisting of Easy Extracts from the Best Authors&quot;&quot;. Wm. H. Allen, 1864. 103 pages.

==Legacy==
In 1760 the Radcliffe Library, Oxford acquired his collection of mainly 13th-18th century Persian and Arabic manuscripts, mostly poetry and belles-lettres. They were transferred to the Bodleian Library in 1872. Richard Alfred Davenport wrote his biography. Works included in Sales library include Ibn Khallikān’s &quot;Wafayāt al-ayān&quot; (MSS Sale 48–49); selection of hadith (MS Sale 70); collections of the stories of saints and martyrs (MS Sale 77–78); the sayings of Alī (MS Sale 82); biographies of Shi&#x27;ite, &quot;Majālis al-mu&#x27;minīn&quot; by Nūr Allāh b.&#x27;Abd Allāh Shushtarī (MS Sale 68); instructions on use of the Quran for divination (MS Sale 69), and a treatise on the merits of visiting the Prophet&#x27;s grave (MS Sale 56).

Sale&#x27;s translation of the Qur&#x27;an has been reprinted into modern times. In January 2007, Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the United States Congress, was sworn in using a 1764 edition of Sale&#x27;s translation of the Quran, sold to the Library of Congress in 1815 by Thomas Jefferson. In January 2019 newly elected Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar were sworn in using the same edition of Sales&#x27;s translation of Qur&#x27;an.

<text>Consorzio Suonatori Indipendenti (C.S.I.; English: &quot;Consortium of Independent Players&quot;) is an Italian band that evolved from the former punk/art band CCCP Fedeli alla linea.

C.S.I. were founded in 1992 by Giovanni Lindo Ferretti and Massimo Zamboni, along with original members of the Italian band Litfiba. The naming conventions of the band followed political changes occurring around the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Whereas the earlier band&#x27;s name referenced the Cyrillic lettering for SSSR (i.e. USSR) as it was wrongly pronounced by peasants in their Italian native region of Emilia Romagna, &quot;CSI&quot; follows the conventions of the Italian acronym for the newly established Commonwealth of Independent States.

After Zamboni departed in 2000, the remaining members of C.S.I. continued in the form of Per Grazia Ricevuta. C.S.I. split in 2001.

<text>Robert Sanderson (19 September 158729 January 1663) was an English theologian and casuist.
==Family and education==
He was born in Sheffield in Yorkshire and grew up at Gilthwaite Hall, near Rotherham. He was educated at Lincoln College, Oxford. Entering the Church, he rose to be Bishop of Lincoln.
==Logician==
His work on logic, &quot;Logicae Artis Compendium&quot; (1615), was long a standard treatise on the subject. It enjoyed at least ten editions during the seventeenth century and was widely read as a textbook. Sanderson&#x27;s biographer, Izaak Walton writes that by 1678, &#x27;Logicae&#x27; had sold 10,000 copies. In her introduction to the 1985 facsimile edition, E. J. Ashworth writes that &quot;The young Isaac Newton studied Sanderson&#x27;s logic at Cambridge, and as late as 1704.&quot; Thomas Heywood of St. John&#x27;s College, Ashworth adds, recommended Newton &quot;Sanderson or Aristotle himself&quot;. Sanderson&#x27;s logic remained popular even after the appearance of the influential Port-Royal Logic.
==Church career==
Sanderson&#x27;s sermons were also admired; but he is perhaps best remembered for his &quot;Nine Cases of Conscience Resolved&quot; (1678), in consideration of which he has been placed at the head of English casuists. He left large collections of historical and heraldic matter in MS.

At the Stuart Restoration, he was elected to the See of Lincoln on 13 October 1660, confirmed 24 October and consecrated a bishop on 28 October. He was a Calvinist in theology and believed only some individuals were predestined to salvation and eternal life by their calling from God. He further believed that the church, being the small group of pious individuals, kept the nation adverse destinies.

Sanderson is today perhaps best known as the subject of one of Izaak Walton&#x27;s Lives, published in 1678.

<text>Robert Charles Sands (May 11, 1799 – December 16, 1832) was an American writer and poet.

==Biography==
Robert Charles Sands was born in Brooklyn, New York on May 11, 1799, the son of Auditor-General Comfort Sands (1748–1834) and his second wife, Cornelia Lott Sands (1761-1856). He was a scholar and a writer of many literary types, but without much originality. His best work is considered to be in his short stories. His most well-known poem is &quot;Yamoyden&quot; which is an Indian story written in collaboration with a friend. He is considered part of the &quot;Knickerbocker group&quot;, which also included Washington Irving, William Cullen Bryant, James Kirke Paulding, Gulian Crommelin Verplanck, Fitz-Greene Halleck, Joseph Rodman Drake, Lydia M. Child, and Nathaniel Parker Willis.

He died in Hoboken, New Jersey on December 16, 1832.

<doc id="1241786" wikidata="Q635933" url="?curid=1241786" title="The Batman (TV series)">
<text>The Batman is an American animated television series based on the DC Comics superhero Batman. Developed by Michael Goguen and Duane Capizzi, and produced by Warner Bros. Animation and DC Comics for seasons 3–5, the series first aired on Kids&#x27; WB on September 11, 2004, then Cartoon Network on April 2, 2005. The show would become exclusive to the former network for its third, fourth, and fifth seasons in early 2006. &quot;The Batman&quot; won six Daytime Emmy Awards over the course of its run. Many elements from previous Batman storylines were borrowed and adapted, such as those from the comic books, film series and the animated shows like &quot;&quot; from the DC Animated Universe, but it remained within its own continuity. &quot;Jackie Chan Adventures&quot; artist Jeff Matsuda served as art director and provided the character designs. The production team altered the appearances of many of the comic books&#x27; supervillains for the show, such as the Joker, the Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Bane, and the Riddler.

All five seasons are available on DVD and Blu-ray. In 2005, a direct-to-DVD film titled &quot;The Batman vs. Dracula&quot; was released. &quot;The Batman&quot; also received a spin-off comic, &quot;The Batman Strikes!&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne (voiced by Rino Romano) is secretly The Batman, the costumed protector of Gotham City. The series focuses on Batman&#x27;s earlier years of his crime-fighting career, as he began fighting crime three years prior to the start of the series, and the Gotham City police do not publicly acknowledge the vigilante&#x27;s existence. Operating out of a secret lair underneath Bruce Wayne&#x27;s mansion—known as the Batcave—Batman and his butler, Alfred Pennyworth (voiced by Alastair Duncan), stop crime with the assistance of high-tech gadgets and a supercomputer.

===Season 1===
At the start of the first season, crime in Gotham is in decline, but Gotham Chief of Police Angel Rojas (voiced in the pilot by Edward James Olmos and later by Jesse Corti), orders his officers to hunt down Batman. This marks the first acknowledgement of Batman&#x27;s existence in the series. Despite Rojas&#x27; orders, one of his detectives, Ethan Bennett (voiced by Steve Harris), believes the city needs Batman. At the start of the series, Bennett is assisted by a new partner from Metropolis, Ellen Yin (voiced by Ming-Na Wen), who becomes torn between her commitment to law and order and her feelings toward Batman.

Throughout season 1, both Bennett and Yin are tasked with capturing Batman. During this first season, Bruce Wayne finds himself torn between his responsibilities as Batman and his regular life, though the latter is supported by Gotham&#x27;s mayor, Marion Grange (voiced by Adam West). By the end of the season, Bennett is exposed to the Joker&#x27;s mutagenic Joker Putty and transformed into Clayface. As Clayface, he is forced into hiding, while his partner Yin finally realizes she was wrong about Batman and forms an alliance with him.

Among the villains introduced this season are the Joker (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson), the Penguin (voiced by Tom Kenny), Catwoman (voiced by Gina Gershon), Mr. Freeze (voiced by Clancy Brown), Firefly (voiced by Jason Marsden), the Ventriloquist (voiced by Dan Castellaneta), Man-Bat (voiced by Peter MacNicol), Cluemaster (voiced by Glenn Shadix), and Bane (voiced by Joaquim de Almeida in the first appearance, Ron Perlman in the second, and Clancy Brown in the third).

===Season 2===
Throughout the second season, Batman continues to act outside of the law even though he has Detective Yin as an ally. Batman begins making a name for himself as a force for good when he saves a group of policemen from certain doom. In this season, his heroic act prompts the officers to support him rather than pursue him as a criminal. In the season finale, Police Chief Rojas uncovers Yin&#x27;s involvement with Batman, forcing her to go on the run. Around this time, James Gordon (voiced by Mitch Pileggi), becomes the police commissioner of Gotham. Unlike most of Gotham&#x27;s police, Gordon is an ally of Batman.

This season introduces more villains, including Rag Doll (voiced by Jeff Bennett), the Riddler (voiced by Robert Englund), Killer Croc (voiced by Ron Perlman), Spellbinder (voiced by Michael Massee), and Solomon Grundy (voiced by Kevin Grevioux). Another new villain, Hugo Strange (initially voiced by Frank Gorshin, who is later replaced by Richard Green after Gorshin&#x27;s death), is portrayed as a secondary character in the season. The characters Yin and Police Chief Rojas make their final appearances at the end of the season.

===Season 3===
The third season introduces Barbara Gordon (voiced by Danielle Judovits), Jim Gordon&#x27;s daughter, who later becomes Batgirl. The opening title sequence is altered and features a new theme performed by Andy Sturmer.

Batgirl appears before Dick Grayson, Batman&#x27;s first sidekick in the comics, due to copyright issues regarding his simultaneous appearances in &quot;Teen Titans&quot;. This season also sees the destruction of Batman&#x27;s original Batmobile, which is replaced by an updated version for the remainder of the series.

Several more new villains from the Batman mythos are introduced this season, including Poison Ivy (voiced by Piera Coppola), Gearhead (voiced by Will Friedle), Maxie Zeus (voiced by Phil LaMarr), the Toymaker (voiced by Patton Oswalt), Prank (voiced by Michael Reisz), Temblor (voiced by Jim Cummings), and D.A.V.E. (voiced Jeff Bennett). Hugo Strange becomes a villain this season, and is later imprisoned at Arkham Asylum.

===Season 4===

With the conclusion of &quot;Teen Titans&quot; in 2006, the fourth season introduces Dick Grayson (voiced by Eve Sabara). The opening episode of the season focuses on Dick Grayson&#x27;s origins as Robin, with Batman adopting him after his parents are murdered. The second episode in the season leads to Batgirl officially becoming part of the team, with each member revealing their secret identity to the others. In a potential future depicted in the episode &quot;Artifacts&quot;, Dick and Barbara respectively become Nightwing (voiced by Jerry O&#x27;Connell) and Oracle (voiced by Kellie Martin).

More villains with new interpretations are once again introduced, including Tony Zucco (voiced by Mark Hamill), Killer Moth (voiced by Jeff Bennett), Black Mask (voiced by James Remar), Rumor (voiced by Ron Perlman), the Everywhere Man (voiced by Brandon Routh), Harley Quinn (voiced by Hynden Walch), and Francis Grey (voiced by Dave Foley). Additionally, Ethan Bennett is cured, with Basil Karlo (voiced by Wallace Langham in the first appearance, and Lex Lang in the second appearance) succeeding him as Clayface. This season also introduces the Justice League, though only Martian Manhunter (voiced by Dorian Harewood) has a speaking appearance.

This was the final season worked on by Jeff Matsuda and Michael Jelenic, with both leaving the show after the season finale.

===Season 5===
The final season on &quot;The Batman&quot;, season 5, focused primarily on Batman and Robin, with the pair teaming up with some of the DC Universe&#x27;s characters to battle different villains. The League consists of Martian Manhunter, Superman (voiced by George Newbern), Green Arrow (voiced by Chris Hardwick), the Flash (voiced by Charlie Schlatter), Green Lantern (voiced by Dermot Mulroney), and Hawkman (voiced by Robert Patrick). Producer Alan Burnett described the season as the show&#x27;s &quot;&quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; season&quot;. Both Batgirl and Commissioner Gordon were relegated to either guest or cameo appearances during the season, with Barbara moving to attend college. The two-part series finale, &quot;Lost Heroes&quot;, has Batman and the League battle a second invasion by the Joining.

Most of the villains featured in the season are enemies of other heroes. They include Lex Luthor (voiced by Clancy Brown), Mercy Graves (voiced by Gwendoline Yeo), Metallo (voiced by Lex Lang), Count Vertigo (voiced by Greg Ellis), Toyman (voiced by Richard Green), Shadow Thief (voiced by Diedrich Bader), Sinestro (voiced by Miguel Ferrer), and Mirror Master (voiced by John Larroquette). Only the Terrible Trio (voiced by David Faustino, Grey DeLisle, and Googy Gress), Wrath (voiced by Christopher Gorham), and Firefly&#x27;s Phosphorus form are reinterpretations of Batman villains.

==Reception==
&quot;IGN&quot; wrote that the series failed to win over diehard Batman fans the way &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; did, but noted that it remained popular enough to last for five seasons.

== Unrealized &quot;Superman&quot; spin-off ==
In June 2006, during an interview about &quot;&quot;, writer Duane Capizzi mentioned a Superman series set in the same universe of &quot;The Batman&quot;, a possibility supported by Superman&#x27;s revealed existence during the show&#x27;s fifth season. Despite this, the expansion was never realized, and Capizzi never again mentioned the spin-off.

<text>Per Grazia Ricevuta, often abbreviated as P.G.R., is an Italian band led by Giovanni Lindo Ferretti. 

The band originated from Ferretti&#x27;s previous project Consorzio Suonatori Indipendenti, which disbanded following the departure of long-time collaborator Massimo Zamboni. Their name &quot;&#x27;Per Grazia Ricevuta&quot; (&quot;For a Received Grace&quot;), also marks a change. It is a stock phrase usually attached to mementos acknowledging miraculous divine gifts, and reflects Lindo Ferretti&#x27;s rediscovery of his Catholic roots following a long career of radical left activism.
PGR&#x27;s lineup changed with the release of the album &quot;D’anime e d’animali&quot; (2004), when founding members Ginevra Di Marco and Francesco Magnelli departed. As a response, the band&#x27;s acronym was slightly changed into PG3R (&quot;Però Gianni Giorgio Giovanni Resistono&quot;, meaning &quot;Yet Gianni Giorgio and Giovanni Resist&quot;). In 2006 PGR performed a tour around Italy entitled &#x27;Ripasso / Ribassi - Saldi, fino ad esaurimento scorte’ (Revision / Discounts - Sales while Stock Lasts). With the release of 2009&#x27;s &quot;Ultime notizie di cronaca&quot;, the band announced its dissolution.

Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, he became an underwriter at Lloyd&#x27;s of London, but then took to travel and writing novels, many of which had great popularity. Scott visited India as a tourist in 1877–1878 and set his novel &quot;Flotsam&quot; (1896) there. He was an enthusiastic traveller, many of his journeys being made with his friend and fellow author Stanley J. Weyman.

Scott married Ethel Frances Hall (1865–1943) on 19 June 1889. They had no children. Scott was unusually modest and retiring in character. He died of appendicitis in 1903, aged 41, at Melton, Suffolk. Scott left £5000 in his will to Evelyn Beatrice Hall, his sister-in-law and a fellow writer, best known for a biographical work, &quot;The Friends of Voltaire&quot;. Scott explained the legacy as a &quot;token of my gratitude for her continued assistance and literary advice, without which I should never have been able to have made a living by my pen.&quot;

He worked with great care, and his best books held a high place in Victorian fiction. His book &quot;The Sowers&quot; was made into a silent film in 1916.

==Novels==
His first novel, &quot;Young Mistley&quot; was published anonymously in 1888. His other novels include &quot;The Phantom Future&quot; (his only novel set entirely in England, 1888), &quot;Suspense&quot; (1890), &quot;The Slave of the Lamp&quot; (1892), &quot;From One Generation to Another&quot; (1892), &quot;With Edged Tools&quot; (a bestseller in 1894), &quot;The Sowers&quot; (generally considered his best, set in Russia, where it was banned) (1896), &quot;In Kedar&#x27;s Tents&quot; (1897), &quot;Roden&#x27;s Corner&quot; (1898), &quot;Dross&quot; (1899), &quot;Grey Lady&quot;; &quot;Isle of Unrest&quot; (1900), &quot;The Velvet Glove&quot;; &quot;The Vultures&quot; (1902), &quot;Queen&quot;; &quot;Barlasch of the Guard&quot; (1903) and &quot;The Last Hope&quot; (1904).

<text>Johann David Schoepff, or Schoepf, or Schöpf, (8 March 1752 – 10 September 1800) was a German botanist, zoologist, and physician.

He was born in Bayreuth and travelled to New York in 1777 as the chief surgeon for the Ansbach regiment of Hessian troops fighting for King George III of the United Kingdom.

During the revolutionary war Schoepff was stationed in Rhode Island. Determined to study the Americas as a scientist once the war ended, he travelled for two years in the United States, British East Florida, and the Bahamas.
He returned to Europe in 1784, where he worked for a time at the United Medical Colleges of Ansbach and Bayreuth. His North American observations are recorded in &quot;Travels in the Confederation&quot; [1783–1784], which first appeared in English translation in 1911. In 1792, he wrote &quot;Historia testvdinvm iconibvs illvstrata&quot; (A Natural History of the Turtles, Illustrated with Engravings), illustrated by Friedrich Wilhelm Wunder.

<text>Willis Andrew McGahee III (born October 21, 1981) is an American former professional football running back. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, earning consensus All-American honors. McGahee was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the 2003 NFL draft. In addition to his time with the Bills, he played for the Baltimore Ravens, Denver Broncos, and Cleveland Browns.

In 2015, McGahee signed on as an athlete for the Miami Surge of the National Pro Grid League.

==Early life==
McGahee was born in Miami, Florida. He attended Miami Central High School for one year after transferring from Miami Springs High School, where he previously attended for three years.

==College career==
McGahee received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Miami, where he played for coach Butch Davis and coach Larry Coker&#x27;s Miami Hurricanes football teams from 2000 to 2002.

McGahee was a member of the 2001 University of Miami team, which won the National Championship over Nebraska in the 2002 Rose Bowl that year.

In 2002, McGahee, along with Ken Dorsey, Andre Johnson, Kellen Winslow II, and others helped lead Miami to an undefeated regular season and a #1 ranking, which included a trip to the National Championship game against second ranked Ohio State. On December 7 against Virginia Tech, he had 39 carries for 205 yards and six rushing touchdowns in the win. His six touchdowns were a Big East record. McGahee broke several records in the 2002 season. He shattered school season records, carrying the ball 282 times for 1,753 yards, for a 6.2 average, and 28 touchdowns. Only UCF&#x27;s Kevin Smith (29 in 2007), Florida Atlantic&#x27;s Devin Singletary (32 in 2017), Nebraska&#x27;s Mike Rozier (29 in 1983), Colorado State&#x27;s Kapri Bibbs (31 in 2013), Wisconsin&#x27;s Montee Ball (33 in 2011), and Oklahoma State&#x27;s Barry Sanders (37 in 1988) ran for more touchdowns in an NCAA Division I-A season. Following his 2002 sophomore season, he was a first-team All-Big east selection and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American. McGahee&#x27;s ten 100-yard performances broke the Hurricanes&#x27; season record of eight, set by Ottis Anderson in 1978; he added 355 yards on 25 receptions, for a 14.2 average, that season. He gained 2,108 all-purpose yards during 2002, which remains a Hurricanes&#x27; season record. He was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, given to the nation&#x27;s top player, finishing fourth in the voting (660 votes), while teammate Ken Dorsey finished fifth with 643 votes.

In the early part of the fourth quarter during the 2003 Fiesta Bowl National Championship Game, McGahee suffered an injury after catching a screen pass from Dorsey. He was immediately hit by Buckeye safety Will Allen, turning his left knee into a swivel joint and causing tears of the ACL, PCL, and MCL. Prior to getting hurt, he had rushed for 67 yards and a touchdown, as Miami would lose the game in double-overtime, 31–24. This injury required several surgeries and extensive rehabilitation before he would be able to play again. At the season&#x27;s end, McGahee announced he would not collect on a $2.5 million insurance policy he had taken out before the Championship game, and therefore would enter the 2003 NFL draft.

At the conclusion of his collegiate career, he had rushed for 2,067 yards and 31 touchdowns. He majored in criminology while at the University of Miami.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Pre-draft===
Prior to his knee injury in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl, McGahee was considered &quot;a cinch top-five pick.&quot; Afterwards, McGahee was projected a late third round pick due to risk of &quot;a long rehabilitation process&quot;.

===Buffalo Bills===
====2003 season====
Eventually, he was selected in the first round with the 23rd overall pick in the 2003 NFL draft by the Buffalo Bills. The Bills originally acquired the pick in a trade that sent Peerless Price to the Atlanta Falcons.

Due to the length of the rehabilitation for his knee, he missed the entire 2003 season.

====2004 season====
McGahee made his NFL debut in Week 1 of the 2004 season against the Jacksonville Jaguars and had nine carries for 31 rushing yards in the 13–10 loss. In Week 6, McGahee assumed the starting role over Travis Henry and had 26 carries for 111 rushing yards in the 20–13 victory over the Miami Dolphins. In Week 8, he scored his first two professional touchdowns in a 38–14 victory over the Arizona Cardinals. In the following game, a 22–17 victory over the New York Jets, he had season-highs with 37 carries for 132 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 22–17 victory. In Week 12, a 38–9 victory over the Seattle Seahawks, he had 28 carries for 116 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. The close out the 2004 season, McGahee had two games going over the 100-yard rushing mark while scoring two rushing touchdowns in both of the games. He finished the 2004 season with 284 carries for 1,128 rushing yards and 13 rushing touchdowns to go along with 22 receptions for 169 receiving yards. He was named by the PFWA as Comeback Player of the Year for the 2004 season.

====2005 season====
McGahee started the 2005 season strong with 22 carries for 117 rushing yards in the 22–7 victory over the Houston Texans. In Week 3 against the Atlanta Falcons, he had 27 carries for 140 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown in the 24–16 loss. In Week 6, against the New York Jets, he had 29 carries for 143 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown in the 27–17 victory. In Week 8, against the New England Patriots, he had 31 carries for 136 rushing yards in the 21–16 loss. McGahee closed out the 2005 regular season with 22 carries for 113 rushing yards in a 30–26 loss to the Jets in Week 17. In the 2005 season, McGahee finished with 325 carries for 1,247 rushing yards and five rushing touchdowns to go along with 28 receptions for 178 receiving yards.

====2006 season====

In Week 3, McGahee had 26 carries for 150 rushing yards in the 28–20 loss to the New York Jets. In Week 12, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he had two rushing touchdowns in the 27–24 victory. In Week 14 against the Jets, he had 16 carries for 125 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 31–13 victory. He finished the 2006 season with 259 carries for 990 rushing yards and six rushing touchdowns to go along with 18 receptions for 156 receiving yards.

Following the 2006 season, after McGahee had made disparaging remarks about the city of Buffalo—including an implication that the Bills should move to Toronto—the Bills traded him to the Baltimore Ravens. The Bills received third and seventh round picks in the 2007 NFL draft and a third round pick in the 2008 NFL draft.

===Baltimore Ravens===

====2007 season====
McGahee was traded to the Baltimore Ravens before the 2007 season. He replaced Jamal Lewis, who left the team to play for the Cleveland Browns. He was slated to earn $40.12 million through a seven-year contract, making him one of the league&#x27;s highest paid running backs. In his first season with Baltimore, he had 294 carries for 1,207 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns. McGahee made his first Pro Bowl in 2007, on the strength of five 100+ yard games, and a streak of seven straight games with a rushing touchdown. In addition, he recorded his first career receiving touchdown, along with a career-high 231 receiving yards on 43 receptions. Due to a cracked rib injury suffered against the Seattle Seahawks late in the season, he came up just short of having his best career rushing season, as he had been on pace to do so at the time with his best yards-per-carry average and his best career yards-per-game average.

====2008 season====
McGahee was slated to be the starting running back under new head coach John Harbaugh in 2008, but various injuries through the season, including eye, shoulder, knee and ankle injuries, kept him from achieving his fourth 1,000-yard season in the NFL. Fullback LeRon McClain wound up taking a majority of the snaps that season, as both McGahee and rookie Ray Rice suffered injuries during the season. Despite his injuries, McGahee still rushed for 671 yards and seven touchdowns, including a career-long 77-yard touchdown run against the Dallas Cowboys. He was instrumental in what Baltimore dubbed their &quot;Three-Headed-Monster&quot; rushing attack and still played a key role in the team&#x27;s 11–5 record and playoff berth.

McGahee&#x27;s first career post-season play came in 2008, and he did not disappoint. With minor injuries to McClain and Rice, the Ravens relied on McGahee to carry their rushing attack in the playoffs, where he was vital in a 27–9 victory over the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Round, and in a close 13–10 victory over the top rated Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round. During the 2008 AFC Championship, Willis was the Ravens&#x27; primary offensive weapon, scoring two touchdowns against the Pittsburgh Steelers to keep the game close. However, following a hard hit by Ryan Clark, he was taken off the field on a stretcher to be evaluated by team physicians. He would later be diagnosed with no serious injury.
====2009 season====
McGahee spent the 2009 offseason more seriously dedicated to rehabbing and coming back better than ever. Despite McGahee&#x27;s extra training, the Ravens decided to go with second-year player Ray Rice as their starter. McClain&#x27;s carries were drastically reduced, as he took on his traditional run blocking FB role, but McGahee&#x27;s carries were also severely limited during several games, as the team either tried to have a pass-heavy attack, or relied almost entirely on Rice. Despite this, Willis remained fresh and injury free the entire season, and would actually become the teams&#x27; leading scorer, with 14 touchdowns (12 rushing, 2 receiving). In Week 2 against the San Diego Chargers, he scored two rushing touchdowns and two receiving touchdowns in one game, another career record, in the 31–26 victory. In the following game, a 34–3 victory over the Cleveland Browns, he had two more rushing touchdowns. In Week 14, a 48–3 victory over the Detroit Lions, he had a third game with two rushing touchdowns. His 14 regular season touchdowns saw him tied for second most touchdowns in the league in 2009. McGahee ended the season with his best career game, racking up 167 rushing yards on 16 carries and three rushing touchdowns in a 21–13 victory over the Oakland Raiders. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against Oakland. He recorded 20 carries for 62 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in a Wild Card Round 33–14 blowout of the New England Patriots.

====2010 season====
During the 2010 offseason, McGahee opted to remain with the Baltimore Ravens, instead of going to another team as a possible starter. He appeared in 15 games and recorded 100 carries for 380 rushing yards and five rushing touchdowns to go along with 14 receptions for 55 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown. In the Wild Card Round against the Kansas City Chiefs, McGahee scored a 25-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter that sealed the win for Baltimore. The Ravens won by a score of 30–7.

The Ravens released McGahee on July 28, 2011, to allow the team to free up salary cap space. In his four seasons as a Baltimore Raven, he accrued over 3,300 total yards from scrimmage, as well as 35 total regular season touchdowns, including 31 rushing touchdowns.

===Denver Broncos===
====2011 season====
On July 30, 2011, McGahee signed a four-year deal with the Denver Broncos worth $9.5 million, $3 million being guaranteed. Following an injury in Week 1 to Knowshon Moreno, McGahee became the primary running back for the Broncos and in Week 2 versus the Cincinnati Bengals, he rushed for 101 yards on 28 carries and one rushing touchdown in the 24–22 victory. In a Week 3 loss to the Tennessee Titans, McGahee ran for 52 yards on 22 carries and had a 5-yard reception for a touchdown. During a Week 4 loss to the Green Bay Packers, McGahee rushed 15 times for 103 yards in the 49–23 loss In a Week 5 loss to the Chargers, McGahee rushed for 125 yards on 16 carries. In the Week 7 win against the Dolphins, in the early second half McGahee already racked up 76 yards with an average of 4.2 yards per carry. It looked as if McGahee was on pace for his third-straight 100 yard game, and fourth of the season. However, McGahee fractured his hand early in the second half as well. In that game, McGahee could have moved up from 10th in the NFL in rushing to 8th. McGahee was unable to play the following week against the Lions due to his injury. The Broncos lost 45–10. However, the following week against the Raiders, McGahee came back with a strong performance. He put up 163 rushing yards, which included a 60-yard touchdown and 24-yard touchdown in the 38–24 victory. In a Week 10 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, McGahee ran up one of his blockers legs, and suffered a left hamstring injury. He was taken to the locker room and listed as questionable to return. Head coach John Fox stated in a post-game press conference that McGahee was fine and could&#x27;ve returned in an emergency situation. Fox said McGahee would most likely be able to play in the next game.

On November 23, 2011, McGahee was named a team captain after the release of captain and backup quarterback Kyle Orton. Coach Fox attributed this to the fact that McGahee &quot;had the next most votes when we took the vote [for team captain] back before the season started.&quot; In the Week 12 versus the Chargers, he rushed for 117 yards on 23 carries. The 117 yards included two 20-plus yard runs. One of which was a 24-yard run in overtime which set up the Broncos inside of the 20-yard line. This critical run set up the game-winning field goal for Denver. In a Week 13 win against the Vikings, he picked up 111 yards on the ground, which included a 24-yard touchdown run.

In Week 15 against the New England Patriots, McGahee rushed for 70 yards averaging 10 yards per carry but was unfortunately pulled out of the game due to a hamstring injury. With only 10 yards to go to eclipse the 1,000-yard mark, Willis was able to accomplish that feat on a 24-yard run against the Buffalo Bills in week 16. He ended the game with only 64 yards rushing and 15 carries. The next week against the Kansas City Chiefs, McGahee rushed for 145 yards on 28 carries in the 7–3 loss. On January 17, 2012, McGahee was added to the 2012 Pro Bowl Roster to replace Arian Foster. He was ranked 98th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.

====2012 season====
For the 2012 season, McGahee started as the number one running back on the Broncos depth chart. McGahee played well, averaging 4.4 yards per carry through his first ten starts. In Week 2, against the Atlanta Falcons, he had 22 carries for 113 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 27–21 loss. He had two other games with one rushing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown, in Weeks 4 and 8. McGahee suffered a season-ending injury in Week 11 in a game against the San Diego Chargers on November 18, 2012. The injury occurred when his knee was hit by the helmet of Chargers cornerback Quentin Jammer during the second quarter of the Broncos&#x27; 30–23 win. Coach John Fox initially stated that McGahee would not be placed on Injured Reserve, but on November 19, McGahee underwent an MRI that revealed a torn medial collateral ligament and compression fracture in his right knee. McGahee was placed on Injured Reserve on November 21, while the Broncos used the NFL&#x27;s new &quot;Designated for Return&quot; label, meaning that he could potentially play in the post season. He finished the 2012 season with 167 carries for 731 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns to go along with 26 receptions for 221 receiving yards.

McGahee was designated for assignment on June 13, 2013, due to health concerns and then waived on June 16.

===Cleveland Browns===

After the Cleveland Browns traded Trent Richardson, their first-round (third overall) pick in the 2012 NFL draft, to the Indianapolis Colts for their first-round choice in 2014, the Browns brought in McGahee to replace him. After passing his team physical, McGahee agreed to terms with the Browns.

In the 2013 season, McGahee appeared in 12 games and had 138 carries for 377 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.

McGahee was known for both his dislike of Applebee&#x27;s (which his successor in Buffalo, Marshawn Lynch, lampooned in an ESPN skit with Kenny Mayne.) and his multiple children with various women in his life. Last count had him at 10 children by 9 different women by the time he was 32.

In 2016, he starred on the E! reality television series &quot;Famously Single&quot;.

McGahee made several appearances in television commercials for Easterns Automotive Group, a local car dealership group on the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore areas, alongside Chief Zee, Antwaan Randle El and Santana Moss.

In a 2023 interview with &quot;The Athletic&quot;, McGahee stated that he had contemplated suicide &quot;a couple of times&quot; since retiring from the NFL.

<text>The grapheme Ž (minuscule: ž) is formed from Latin Z with the addition of caron (, , , ). It is used in various contexts, usually denoting the voiced postalveolar fricative, the sound of English &quot;g&quot; in &quot;mirage&quot;, &quot;s&quot; in &quot;vision&quot;, or Portuguese and French &quot;j&quot;. In the International Phonetic Alphabet this sound is denoted with , but the lowercase ž is used in the Americanist phonetic notation, as well as in the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet. In addition, ž is used as the romanisation of Cyrillic ж in ISO 9 and scientific transliteration.

For use in computer systems, &quot;Ž&quot; and &quot;ž&quot; are at Unicode codepoints U+017D and U+017E, respectively. On Windows computers, it can be typed with Alt+0142 and Alt+0158, respectively.

Ž is the last letter of most alphabets that contain it, but exceptions include Estonian, Karelian, Veps, and Turkmen.

==Origin==
The symbol originates with the Czech alphabet. In Czech printed books it first appeared in the late 15th century. It evolved from the letter Ż, introduced by the author of the early 15th-century &quot;De orthographia Bohemica&quot; (probably Jan Hus) to indicate a Slavic fricative not represented in Latin alphabet. The &quot;punctus rotundus&quot; over was gradually replaced by háček (caron). This orthography later became standard and was popularized by the Bible of Kralice.
It was occasionally used for the closely related Slovak language during the period when it lacked a literary norm. From Czech, it was adopted into the Croatian alphabet by Ljudevit Gaj in 1830, and then into the Slovak, Slovenian, Serbian and Bosnian alphabets. In addition, it features in the orthographies of the Baltic, some Uralic and other languages.

==Uses==

===Slavic languages===
It is the 42nd letter of the Czech, the 46th letter of Slovak, the 25th letter of the Slovenian alphabet, as well as the 30th letter of the Serbo-Croatian latinic alphabet and the Macedonian one (as a counterpart or transliteration of Cyrillic Ж in the latter two). It is the 27th letter of the Sorbian alphabet, and it appears in the Belarusian latin alphabet.

It is used in Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian, and Bulgarian transliteration.

The letter represents a voiced postalveolar fricative except in Russian transliterations of Ж where it represents a voiced retroflex fricative .

In Polish, the corresponding letter is Ż/ż.

===Baltic languages===
It is the 32nd letter of the Lithuanian and 33rd letter of the Latvian alphabets.

===Uralic languages===
It is the 20th letter of the Estonian alphabet, where it is used in loan words. It is the 22nd letter of the Karelian and Veps alphabets. It is the 29th letter of the Northern Sami alphabet, where it represents . It is regarded as a variant of Z in Finnish.

In Finnish, the letter ž is used in loan words, &quot;džonkki&quot; and &quot;maharadža&quot;, and in romanization of Cyrillic and other non-Latin alphabets. In Finnish and Estonian, it is possible to replace &quot;ž&quot; with &quot;zh&quot; when it is technically impossible to typeset the accented character.

In Hungarian, the corresponding letter is the digraph Zs.

===Other languages===
* It is the 12th letter of the Turkmen alphabet, pronounced .
* It is the 33rd letter of the Laz alphabet, where it represents .
* It is the 27th and last letter of the Songhay alphabet.
* It is used in Persian romanization, equivalent to ژ.
* It is used in Devanagari romanization for the letter झ़, albeit unofficially and rarely.
* It is also used in the standard orthography of the Lakota language.
* It is also used (unofficially) in Cypriot Greek to depict , which does not occur in the Standard Modern Greek, or the Greek Alphabet.
* It is, at times, used for romanization of Syriac to represent in borrowed Iranian words, but the digraph &quot;zh&quot; is more commonly used.

<text>The Pennsylvania Dutch Country (Pennsylvania Dutch: &quot;Pennsylvanie Deitschland,&quot; &quot;Deitscherei,&quot; or &quot;Pennsilfaanisch-Deitschland&quot;), or Pennsylvania Dutchland, is a region of German Pennsylvania spanning the Delaware Valley and South Central and Northeastern regions of Pennsylvania.

By the American Revolution in the 18th century, the region had a high percentage of Pennsylvania Dutch inhabitants. Religiously, they were predominantly Lutherans but also included German Reformed, Moravian, Amish, Mennonite, Schwarzenau Brethren, and other German Christian denominations. Catholics settled around early Jesuit missions in Conewago near Hanover and Goshenhoppen, now known as Bally. The term was used in the middle of the 20th century as a description of a region with a distinctive Pennsylvania Dutch culture, but in recent decades the composition of the population is changing and the phrase is used more now in a tourism context than any other.

The Greater Pennsylvania Dutch Country (Pennsylvania Dutch: &quot;Die Breet-Deitscherei&quot; (The Broad Dutchery) refers to this Pennsylvania region but also includes smaller enclaves of Pennsylvania Dutch-speaking areas in New York, Delaware, Maryland, Ohio, West Virginia, North Carolina, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Virginia, and the Canadian province of Ontario.

==High-Dutch Pennsylvania==

Waves of colonial Palatines from the Rhenish Palatinate, one of the Holy Roman states, settled in the Province of New York and the Province of Pennsylvania. The first Palatines arrived in the late 1600s but the majority came throughout the 1700s; they were known collectively as the Palatine Dutch. Many American Palatines settled other states, including Indiana and Ohio.

American Palatines continued to use their language as a way of distinguishing themselves from later (post-1830) waves of German-speaking immigrants to the United States. The Pennsylvania Dutch came to refer to themselves as &quot;Deitsche&quot;, and called immigrants of German-speaking countries and territories in Europe &quot;Deitschlenner&quot;, (literally &quot;Dutchlanders&quot;, compare ), which translates to &quot;European Germans&quot;, whom they saw as a distinct group.

These European Germans immigrated to Pennsylvania Dutch cities, where many came to prominence in matters of the church, newspapers and urban business. After the 1871 unification of the first German Empire, the term &quot;Dutchlander&quot; came to refer to the nationality of people from the Pennsylvania Dutch Country.

==Geography==
Geographically the area referred to as Amish/Dutch country centers on the cities of Allentown, Hershey, Lancaster, Reading, and York. Pennsylvania Dutch Country encompasses the counties of Lancaster, York, Adams, Franklin, Dauphin, Cumberland, Lebanon, Berks, Northampton, Montgomery, Lehigh, Schuylkill, Snyder, Union, Juniata, Mifflin, Huntingdon, Northumberland, and Centre. Pennsylvania Dutch immigrants would spread from this area outwards outside the Pennsylvania borders between the mountains along river valleys into neighboring Maryland (Washington, Frederick, and Carroll counties), West Virginia, New Jersey (Warren and northern Hunterdon counties), Virginia (Shenandoah Valley), and North Carolina. The larger region has been historically referred to as Greater Pennsylvania. The historic Pennsylvania Dutch diaspora in Ontario, Canada, has been referred to as Little Pennsylvania.

The area lies in the Piedmont region of the Appalachian Mountains. The landscape is marked by rolling, wooded hills, deep stream valleys, and fertile soils. The Susquehanna River bisects the region and provides its drainage.

==History==
===19th century===
Contrary to popular belief, the word Dutch in Pennsylvania Dutch is not a mistranslation, but rather a variation of the Pennsylvania German endonym &quot;Deitsch&quot;, which means &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch / German&quot; or &quot;German&quot;. Ultimately, the terms Deitsch, Dutch, Diets and Deutsch are all cognates of the Proto-Germanic word meaning &quot;popular&quot; or &quot;of the people&quot;. The continued use of Pennsylvania Dutch to describe them was strengthened by the Pennsylvania Dutch in the 19th century as a way of distinguishing thems from the later (post-1830) waves of German immigrants to the U.S. Further, the Pennsylvania Dutch referred to themselves as &quot;Deitsche&quot; and to Germans as &quot;Deitschlenner&quot; (literally &quot;Germany-ers&quot;, compare &quot;Deutschland-er&quot;) whom they saw as a related but distinct group.

Many Dutchlanders are descendants of Palatine refugees. The German-speaking settlers came from a variety of countries and religious backgrounds, but most became assimilated to Anglo-American language and culture beginning in the second half of the 19th century with English-language evangelism efforts and the outlawing of German-language schooling.

===20th century===
The assimilation process continued soon after the turn of the 20th century with World War I, consolidated schools, and the advent of mandatory public education until the age of 16, with added pressures from increased mobility, the influence of English-language media, communications, and urbanization. Also, many German-Americans hid their ethnicity with the spread of anti-German sentiment and propaganda.

Originally, the economy of the region was almost entirely rural and agricultural, based on the immigrants&#x27; dream of bettering their lot through the ownership of their own farms. The small tradesmen indispensable to a rural economy, such as blacksmiths, wheelwrights, millers, and storekeepers, constituted the bulk of the non-farm economy. In the 19th century, a small educated class, comprising the Lutheran and Reformed ministers, began to emerge. The Pennsylvania seminaries educated them in High German so that they could preach to their flocks in a scholarly way.

The advent of the industrial revolution brought technologies based on coal, iron, canals, and railroads, but the Dutch, unversed in English, and lacking connections to the English-speaking establishment, were unable to engage in entrepreneurship on a large scale. Consequently, the large-scale enterprises which came to characterize the industrialized eastern half of the region, such as the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company (marketer of the coal branded &quot;Old Company&#x27;s Lehigh&quot;), the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and the Bethlehem Iron Company (later known as Bethlehem Steel) were founded by English speaking residents from the Philadelphia and New York areas. The English-speakers (referred to by the Dutch as simply &quot;the English&quot;) dominated the managerial and engineering positions of these companies, and the Dutch supplied the blue collar and supervisory workforce.

As technology advanced, higher technology companies such as Mack Trucks and New Jersey Zinc moved to the region as well. As the local industries expanded, immigrants from Middle Europe (primarily Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary) were recruited for the low-skilled positions, and the more established Dutch retained the skilled blue collar and supervisory positions. The Dutch influence on the shop floor was so great that some Slavic immigrants became bilingual in their native language and in Pennsylvania Dutch while they had not yet mastered English.
In the 20th century however, universal public education in English and relatively easy access to higher education erased many of the elements that made the Pennsylvania Dutch Country a distinctive region of the United States. The information age and globalization greatly reduced the dependence of the region on industrial jobs. The Eastern part of the region (Northampton, Lehigh, and Berks Counties) is now dominated by information-intensive white collar employment.

The western counties of the region experienced industrialization as well, with Hershey Foods being the most notable example, but it was less intensive, and agriculture retained a larger share of the economy. In the middle of the 20th century, both Amish and non-Amish entrepreneurs began to promote the area as a tourist destination. 

===21st century===
Although there are still plenty of Amish attempting to follow their traditional way of life, tourism and population growth have significantly changed the appearance and cultural flavor of the area. The region is within 50 miles of Philadelphia, Baltimore, Maryland, and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and has not escaped the effects of being located on the western edge of the East Coast conurbation which stretches from Washington, D.C. to New York City.

The Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites, who have resisted these urbanization efforts most successfully, have retained aspects of their 18th century way of life, including the Deitsch dialect; however, these groups have changed significantly in the last two hundred years. Nevertheless, for the Old Order groups, change has come slower, and gradually they have become more and more distinctively different as the surrounding rural and urban population of Pennsylvania has changed.

<text>Abhinavagupta (Devanāgarī अभिनवगुप्तः; c. 950 – 1016 CE) was a philosopher, mystic and aesthetician from Kashmir. He was also considered an influential musician, poet, dramatist, exegete, theologian, and logician – a polymathic personality who exercised strong influences on Indian culture.

Abhinavagupta was born in a Kānyakubja Brāhmin family of scholars and mystics whose ancestors immigrated from Kannauj on invitation by the great king of Kashmir, Lalitaditya Muktapida. He studied all the schools of philosophy and art of his time under the guidance of as many as fifteen (or more) teachers and gurus. In his long life he completed over 35 works, the largest and most famous of which is &quot;Tantrāloka&quot;, an encyclopedic treatise on all the philosophical and practical aspects of Kaula and Trika (known today as Kashmir Shaivism). Another one of his very important contributions was in the field of philosophy of aesthetics with his famous &quot;Abhinavabhāratī&quot; commentary of &quot;Nāṭyaśāstra&quot; of Bharata Muni.

==Life==
&quot;Abhinavagupta&quot; was not his real name, rather a title he earned from his Guru, meaning &quot;competence and authoritativeness&quot;. In his analysis, Jayaratha (1150–1200 AD) – who was Abhinavagupta&#x27;s most important commentator – also reveals three more meanings: &quot;being ever vigilant&quot;, &quot;being present everywhere&quot; and &quot;protected by praises&quot;. Raniero Gnoli, the only Sanskrit scholar who completed a translation of Tantrāloka in a European language, mentions that &quot;Abhinava&quot; also means &quot;new&quot;, as a reference to the ever-new creative force of his mystical experience.

From Jayaratha, we learn that Abhinavagupta was in possession of all the six qualities required for the recipients of the tremendous level of śaktipāta, as described in the sacred texts (Śrīpūrvaśāstra): an unflinching faith in God, realisation of mantras, control over objective principles (referring to the 36 tattvas), successful conclusion of all the activities undertaken, poetic creativity and spontaneous knowledge of all disciplines.

Abhinavagupta&#x27;s creation is well equilibrated between the branches of the triad (Trika): will (&quot;icchā&quot;), knowledge (&quot;jñāna&quot;), action (&quot;kriyā&quot;); his works also include devotional songs, academical/philosophical works and works describing ritual/yogic practices.

As an author, he is considered a systematiser of the philosophical thought. He reconstructed, rationalised and orchestrated the philosophical knowledge into a more coherent form, assessing all the available sources of his time, not unlike a modern scientific researcher.

Various contemporary scholars have characterised Abhinavagupta as a &quot;brilliant scholar and saint&quot;, &quot;the pinnacle of the development of Kaśmir Śaivism&quot; and &quot;in possession of yogic realization&quot;.

==Social background, family and disciples==

===&quot;Magical&quot; birth===
The term by which Abhinavagupta himself defines his origin is &quot;yoginībhū&quot;, &#x27;born of a yoginī&#x27;. In Kashmir Shaivism and especially in Kaula it is considered that a progeny of parents &quot;established in the divine essence of Bhairava&quot;, is endowed with exceptional spiritual and intellectual prowess. Such a child is supposed to be &quot;the depository of knowledge&quot;, who &quot;even as a child in the womb, has the form of Shiva&quot;, to enumerate but a few of the classical attributes of his kind.

===Parents===
Abhinavagupta was born in a Kanyakubja Brahmin family in Kashmir. His mother, &quot;Vimalā&quot; (&quot;Vimalakalā&quot;) died when Abhinavagupta was just two years old; as a consequence of losing his mother, of whom he was reportedly very attached, he grew more distant from worldly life and focused all the more on spiritual endeavour.

The father, Narasiṃhgupt, after his wife&#x27;s death favoured an ascetic lifestyle, while raising his three children. He had a cultivated mind and a heart &quot;outstandingly adorned with devotion to Mahesvara (Shiva)&quot; (in Abhinavagupta&#x27;s own words). He was Abhinavagupta&#x27;s first teacher, instructing him in grammar, logic and literature.

===Family===

Abhinavagupta had a brother and a sister. His brother, Manoratha, was a well-versed devotee of Shiva. His sister, Ambā (probable name, according to Navjivan Rastogi), devoted herself to worship after the death of her husband in late life.

His cousin Karṇa demonstrated even from his youth that he grasped the essence of Śaivism and was detached of the world. His wife was presumably Abhinavagupta&#x27;s older sister Ambā, who looked with reverence upon her illustrious brother. Ambā and Karṇa had a son, Yogeśvaridatta, who was precociously talented in yoga

Abhinavagupta also mentions his disciple Rāmadeva as faithfully devoted to scriptural study and serving his master. Another cousin was Kṣema, possibly the same as Abhinavagupta&#x27;s illustrious disciple Kṣemarāja. Mandra, a childhood friend of Karṇa, was their host in a suburban residence; he was not only rich and in possession of a pleasing personality, but also equally learned. And last but not least, Vatasikā, Mandra&#x27;s aunt, who got a special mention from Abhinavagupta for caring for him with exceptional dedication and concern; to express his gratitude, Abhinavagupta declared that Vatasikā deserved the credit for the successful completion of his work.

The emerging picture here is that Abhinavagupta lived in a nurturing and protected environment, where his creative energies got all the support they required. Everyone around him was filled with spiritual fervor and had taken Abhinavagupta as their spiritual master. Such a supporting group of family and friends was equally necessary as his personal qualities of genius, to complete a work of the magnitude of Tantrāloka.

===Ancestors===
By Abhinavagupta&#x27;s own account, his most remote known ancestor was called Atrigupta, born in antarved Kānyakubja in Madhyadesha, i.e. the Middle Country. From Madhyadeśa he travelled to Kashmir at the request of king Lalitāditya, around year 740 CE.

==Masters==
Abhinavagupta is famous for his voracious thirst for knowledge. To study he took many teachers (as many as fifteen), both mystical philosophers and scholars. He approached Vaiṣṇavas, Buddhists, Śiddhānta Śaivists, and the Trika scholars.

Among the most prominent of his teachers, he enumerates four, two of whom were Vāmanātha, who instructed him in dualistic Śaivism, and Bhūtirāja in the dualist/nondualist school. Besides being the teacher of the famous Abhinavagupta, Bhūtirāja was also the father of two eminent scholars.

Lakṣmaṇagupta, a direct disciple of Utpaladeva, in the lineage of Trayambaka, was highly respected by Abhinavagupta and taught him all the schools of monistic thought: Krama, Trika, and Pratyabhijña (except Kula). Śambhunātha taught him the fourth school (Ardha-trayambaka). This school is in fact Kaula, and it was emanated from Trayambaka&#x27;s daughter.

For Abhinavagupta, Śambhunātha was the most admired guru. Describing the greatness of his master, he compared Śambhunātha to the Sun, in his power to dispel ignorance from the heart, and, in another place, with &quot;the Moon shining over the ocean of Trika knowledge.&quot; Abhinavagupta received Kaula initiation through Śambhunātha&#x27;s wife (acting as a dūtī or conduit). The energy of this initiation is transmitted and sublimated into the heart and finally into consciousness. Such a method is difficult but very rapid and is reserved for those who shed their mental limitations and are pure. It was Śambhunātha who requested he write Tantrāloka. As guru, he had a profound influence in the structure of Tantrāloka and in the life of its creator, Abhinavagupta.

As many as twelve more of his principal teachers are enumerated by name but without details. It is believed that Abhinavagupta had more secondary teachers. Moreover, during his life he had accumulated a large number of texts from which he quoted in his magnum opus, in his desire to create a syncretic, all-inclusive system, where the contrasts of different scriptures could be resolved by integration into a superior perspective.

==Lifestyle==
Abhinavagupta remained unmarried all his life, and as an adept of Kaula, at least initially maintained brahmacharya and supposedly used the vital force of his energy (ojas) to deepen his understanding of the spiritual nervous system he outlined in his works—a system involving ritual union between Purusha (as Shiva) and Shakti. Such union is essentially non-physical and universal, and thus Abhinavagupta conceived himself as always in communion with Shiva-Shakti. In the context of his life and teachings, Abhinavagupta parallels Shiva as both ascetic and enjoyer.

Abhinavagupta studied assiduously at least until the age of thirty or thirty-five. To accomplish that he travelled, mostly inside Kashmir. By his own testimony, he had attained spiritual liberation through his Kaula practice, under the guidance of his most admired master, Śambhunātha. He lived in his home (functioning as an ashram) with his family members and disciples, and he did not become a wandering monk, nor did he take on the regular duties of his family, but lived out his life as a writer and a teacher. Abhinavagupta&#x27;s personality was described as a living realisation of his vision.

In an epoch pen-painting, Abhinavagupta is depicted seated in Virasana, surrounded by devoted disciples and family, performing a kind of trance-inducing music on a veena while dictating verses of Tantrāloka to one of his attendees--behind him two dūtī (women yogi) waiting on him. A legend about the moment of his death (placed somewhere between 1015 and 1025, depending on the source), says that he took with him 1,200 disciples and marched off to a cave, today this cave is known by (Abhinavagupta Cave) located at hill called Bairam at Beerwah, reciting his poem &quot;Bhairava-stava&quot;, a devotional work. They were never to be seen again, supposedly translating together into the spiritual world.

==Works==
Abhinavagupta&#x27;s works fall into multiple sections: manuals of religious ritual, devotional songs, philosophical works and philosophy of aesthetics. Here are enumerated most of his works. Bold type faced titles represent the most important ones.

===Religious works===

====Tantraloka====

His most important work was &quot;Tantrāloka&quot; (&quot;Elucidation of Tantra&quot;), a synthesis of the entire Trika system. The esoteric chapter 29 on the Kaula ritual was translated in English together with &quot;Jayaratha&quot;&#x27;s commentary by John R. Dupuche. A complex study on the context, authors, contents and references of &quot;Tantrāloka&quot; was published by Navjivan Rastogi, Prof. of the Lucknow University. The first complete English translation of &quot;Tantrāloka&quot; was published by the Indologist Mark S. G. Dyczkowski in 2023 after 45 years of work. The last recognized master of the oral tradition of Kashmir Shaivism, Swami Lakshman Joo, gave a condensed version of the key philosophical chapters of &quot;Tantrāloka&quot; in his book, &quot;Kashmir Shaivism – The Secret Supreme&quot;.

Another important text was the commentary on Parātrīśikā, &quot;Parātrīśikāvivaraṇa&quot;, detailing the signification of the phonematic energies and their two sequential ordering systems, Mātṛkā and Mālinī. This was the last major translation project of Jaideva Singh.

====Tantrasara====

Tantrasāra (&quot;Essence of Tantra&quot;) is a summarised version, in prose, of &quot;Tantrāloka&quot;, which was once more summarised in &quot;Tantroccaya&quot;, and finally presented in a very short summary form under the name of &quot;Tantravaṭadhānikā&quot; – the &quot;Seed of Tantra&quot;.

&quot;Pūrvapañcikā&quot; was a commentary of &quot;Pūrvatantra&quot;, alias Mālinīvijaya Tantra, lost to this day. &quot;Mālinīvijayā-varttika&quot; (&quot;Commentary on Mālinīvijaya&quot;) is a versified commentary on &quot;Mālinīvijaya Tantra&quot;&#x27;s first verse. &quot;Kramakeli&quot;, &quot;Krama&#x27;s Play&quot; was a commentary of &quot;Kramastotra&quot;, now lost. &quot;Bhagavadgītārtha-saṃgraha&quot; which translates &quot;Commentary on Bhagavad Gita&quot; has now an English translation by Boris Marjanovic.

Other religious works are: &quot;Parātrīśikā-laghuvṛtti&quot;, &quot;A Short Commentary on Parātrīśikā&quot;, &quot;Paryantapañcāśīkā&quot; (&quot;Fifty Verses on the Ultimate Reality&quot;), &quot;Rahasyapañcadaśikā&quot; (&quot;Fifteen Verses on the Mystical Doctrine&quot;), &quot;Laghvī prakriyā&quot; (&quot;Short Ceremony&quot;), &quot;Devīstotravivaraṇa&quot; (&quot;Commentary on the Hymn to Devi&quot;) and &quot;Paramārthasāra&quot; (&quot;Essence of the Supreme Reality&quot;).

=== Devotional hymns ===
Abhinavagupta has composed a number of devotional poems, most of which have been translated into French by Lilian Silburn:

* &quot;Bodhapañcadaśikā&quot; – &quot;Fifteen Verses on Consciousness&quot;;
* &quot;Paramārthacarcā&quot; – &quot;Discussion on the Supreme Reality&quot;;
* &quot;Anubhavanivedana&quot; – &quot;Tribute of the Inner Experience&quot;;
* &quot;Anuttarāṣṭikā&quot; – &quot;Eight Verses on Anuttara&quot;;
* &quot;Krama-stotra&quot; – an hymn, different from the fundamental text of the Krama school;
* &quot;Bhairava-stava&quot; – &quot;Hymn to Bhairava&quot;;
* &quot;Dehasthadevatācakra-stotra&quot; – &quot;Hymn to the Wheel of Divinities that Live in the Body&quot;;
* &quot;Paramārthadvādaśikā&quot; – &quot;Twelve Verses on the Supreme Reality&quot; and
* &quot;Mahopadeśa-viṃśatikā&quot; – &quot;Twenty Verses on the Great Teaching&quot;.
* Another poem &quot;Śivaśaktyavinābhāva-stotra&quot; – &quot;Hymn on the Inseparability of Shiva and Shakti&quot; was lost.

===Philosophical works===
One of the most important works of Abhinavagupta is &quot;Īśvarapratyabhijñā-vimarśini&quot; (&quot;Commentary to the Verses on the Recognition of the Lord&quot;) and &quot;Īśvarapratyabhijñā-vivṛti-vimarśini&quot; (&quot;Commentary on the explanation of &quot;Īśvarapratyabhijñā&quot;&quot;). This treatise is fundamental in the transmission of the &quot;Pratyabhijña&quot; school (the branch of Kashmir Shaivism based on direct recognition of the Lord) to our days. Another commentary on a &quot;Pratyabhijña&quot; work – &quot;Śivadṛṣtyā-locana&quot; (&quot;Light on Śivadṛṣṭi&quot;) – is now lost. Another lost commentary is &quot;Padārthapraveśa-nirṇaya-ṭīkā&quot; and &quot;Prakīrṇkavivaraṇa&quot; (&quot;Comment on the Notebook&quot;) referring to the third chapter of &quot;Vākyapadīya&quot; of Bhartrihari. Two more philosophical texts of Abhinavagupta are &quot;Kathāmukha-tilaka&quot; (&quot;Ornament of the Face of Discourses&quot;) and &quot;Bhedavāda-vidāraṇa&quot; (&quot;Confrontation of the Dualist Thesis&quot;).

===Poetical and dramatic works===

&quot;Abhinavagupta&quot;s most important work on the philosophy of art is &quot;Abhinavabhāratī&quot; – a long and complex commentary on Natya Shastra of Bharata Muni. This work has been one of the most important factors contributing to Abhinavagupta&#x27;s fame up until present day. His most important contribution was that to the theory of rasa (aesthetic savour).

Other poetical works include: &quot;Ghaṭa-karpara-kulaka-vivṛti&quot;, a commentary on &quot;Ghaṭakarpara&quot; of Kalidasa; &quot;Kāvyakauṭukavivaraṇa&quot;, a &quot;Commentary to the Wonder of Poetry&quot; (a work of Bhaṭṭa Tauta), now lost; and &quot;Dhvanyālokalocana&quot;, &quot;Illustration of Dhvanyāloka&quot;, which is a famous work of Anandavardhana.

<text>The National Bank of Belgium (NBB; , NBB; , BNB; , BNB) is the Belgian member of the Eurosystem. It was established by a law of and has been the monetary authority for Belgium from then until 1998, issuing the Belgian franc (albeit with interruption during World War I and duplication during World War II, when two National Banks with diverging loyalties operated in parallel from Brussels and London between July 1941 and September 1944).

Since 2011, the National Bank has also been Belgium&#x27;s prudential supervisory authority, and since 2014, its national competent authority within European Banking Supervision. In the area of financial market infrastructure, it stands out as supervisor of Euroclear and lead overseer of SWIFT; it also operates a central securities depository of its own, the National Bank of Belgium Securities Settlement System or NBB-SSS. Additional tasks include the management of foreign currency reserves; the collection, circulation and analysis of economic and financial information; a role of financial ambassador to international economic and financial bodies; and services for the Belgian State, the Belgian financial sector, and the general public.

The Belgian government has held half of the National Bank&#x27;s equity since the aftermath of World War II. It thus remains one of relatively few central banks whose equity capital is partly in private hands, with stock being traded on Euronext Brussels.

==History==
===Creation and early decades===

The National Bank was created by Minister Walthère Frère-Orban in 1850 with a unique hybrid status: in the form of a limited company, but with the main objective to carry out missions of general interest entrusted to it by legislation of 5 May 1850, including replacing the Société Générale de Belgique (SGB) as fiscal agent of the Belgian government. It came from a protracted process of negotiation with the Société Générale and the Banque de Belgique, until then the two main financial institutions in the country which had been negatively impacted by financial turmoil in 1848. As part of the same train of reform, Frère-Orban established the , which later became the Caisse Générale d&#x27;Épargne et de Retraite. Initially the National Bank was mainly an issuing and discounting bank, leaving the business of longer-term credit and investment to the SGB and others.

The National Bank&#x27;s design was widely viewed as an improvement on earlier central banks. It soon became a source of reference in other countries, including the Netherlands with the reform of De Nederlandsche Bank in 1864 and Japan with the creation of the Bank of Japan in 1882. The NBB&#x27;s prominent influence over the Bank of Japan&#x27;s institutional design was paralleled 15 years later in terms of architectural influence, as Bank of Japan architect Tatsuno Kingo was inspired by the buildings designed by Hendrik Beyaert for the National Bank in Brussels and Antwerp. In 1910, a report of the U.S. National Monetary Commission noted: &quot;The history of the National Bank of Belgium is of special interest to the student of banking systems because of [...] the ability of its founders to garner up the results of the experience of Belgium and of other countries in what they conceived to be the best attainable form of organization&quot;. Its charter was renewed in 1872 and in 1900, each time giving rise to extensive parliamentary debates about its mandate and setup.

===World War I and interwar period===

On 26 August 1914, shortly before the outbreak of World War I, minister of Finance Michel Levie ordered the National Bank to send its reserve assets to London. In retaliation, the German occupier force withdrew the National Bank&#x27;s issuing privileges by decree of 20 November 1914, and entrusted it to the SGB instead. The SGB, however, still used the National Bank&#x27;s printing presses. Once the war was over, the National Bank regained its issuing privileges.

During the European banking crisis of 1931, the National Bank had large holding in pound sterling and therefore incurred significant losses when the United Kingdom exited the Gold standard in September 1931. It had to rely on an emergency non-interest-bearing loan from the Belgian government to stay afloat.

===World War II and postwar development===

When Belgium was invaded in May 1940, its leadership and much of the staff again left the country and initially relocated to France. In late June, the German forces in Brussels forced the creation of a Bank of Issue () to supply the occupied country&#x27;s currency needs and to finance the payments of occupation costs. Following France&#x27;s defeat, however, Governor Georges Janssen led the National Bank&#x27;s return to Brussels by mid-July, even though he ensured that a representative in London could manage the Bank&#x27;s foreign assets. The Bank of Issue kept acting as an adjunct to the National Bank, particularly by financing the clearing claims on Germany.

After Janssen&#x27;s death in June 1941, the London-based Belgian government in exile repudiated the appointment of its Brussels-based successor Albert Goffin and instead expanded the London office into a fully-fledged administration-in-exile of the National Bank led by former Prime Minister Georges Theunis from late November 1941. A series of agreements in 1940 and 1941 resulted in the Belgian Congo joining the Sterling area. The Banque du Congo Belge thus became an important financial agency of the exiled government during the war, and temporarily severed links with its occupied head office in Brussels.

Meanwhile, the National Bank under occupation in Brussels kept operating, led until the liberation of Belgium by Goffin who was simultaneously President of the Bank of Issue, and with a German Commissioner, Hans von Becker, overseeing both institutions. The National Bank and Bank of Issue together financed the German war effort by printing large amounts of Belgian currency, triggering high inflation.

Before the war started, the National Bank had prudently moved one third of its gold reserves to the United Kingdom and another third to the United States and Canada. in early 1940, Finance Minister Camille Gutt directed the relocation of the last third, or 200 tons, to France. The gold was shipped from Ostend to Bordeaux and taken in custody by the Bank of France. With the advance of German troops, the latter further moved the National Bank&#x27;s gold in early June 1940 to Lorient, a military port. The National Bank wanted the gold to be transported from there to the United States, but the French Navy shipped it instead to Dakar, where it landed on and was subsequently moved inland to Kayes in present-day Mali. In late 1940, collaborationist French Prime Minister Pierre Laval decided to hand over the National Bank&#x27;s gold to the Reichsbank; the gold eventually reached Berlin in May 1942, via French Algeria and Marseille, and was melted into new ingots with false year marks at the Reichsmünze. On , the London-based National Bank under Theunis&#x27;s leadership sued the Bank of France in New York, eventually reaching a settlement in October 1944 by which the Bank of France agreed to full retrocession. The Bank of France in turn was able to recover 130 tons after the gold was found by U.S. forces together with stolen art in a salt mine in Merkers, Thuringia and reclaimed by the National Bank via the Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of Monetary Gold.

The National Bank was part-nationalized following the end of World War II. Unlike the cases of the Bank of England and Bank of France, both of which were fully nationalized, the Belgian government left the National Bank&#x27;s prior private-sector shareholders in ownership of half of its equity.

===21st century===

Following the turmoil that affected Fortis and Dexia in late 2008, an overhaul of financial regulation in Belgium led to the closure of the Belgian Banking Commission and the entrusting of prudential supervision to the National Bank, while the Financial Services and Markets Authority was created to take over the oversight of market integrity and conduct-of-business regulation.

The printing works of the National Bank closed its doors in August 2020, and the building that hosted them in the center of Brussels was sold in 2021. Since then, the BNB no longer prints euro banknotes itself. At the end of 2020, the Bank had 1,680 full-time equivalent workers.

In September 2022, the quotation of the NBB stock was suspended after its stock price collapsed due to information that the bank would make losses as a consequences of the abrupt interest rates hikes decided by the European Central Bank. Despite these losses, there are currently no plans for the NBB to request a recapitalization from the Belgian government. The NBB made clear that it could operate with negative equity.

==Ownership==

The NBB is one of the rare central banks in Europe that still is a private entity with private shareholders (other examples are Greece, Switzerland and Italy).

The Federal Government of Belgium owns half of the National Bank&#x27;s shares. the rest of the shares are listed on Euronext Brussels and widely dispersed among market participants, with no shareholder known to hold more than one percent of total equity as of early 2024.

==Head office==

The National Bank was initially located on the Rue Royale/Koningsstraat, at the corner of what is now the /, in a building that is no longer extant. In 1859, it acquired properties on the nearby /, and commissioned architects Hendrik Beyaert and to design a new building. Construction work started in 1860, with sections opened in 1865, the whole building completed in 1874 and interior decoration finishing in 1878. That building was subsequently repurposed as the formal apartment of the National Bank&#x27;s governor until 1957, and is still known as the . The ground floor and first floor of the are still preserved in a state close to that in the 1870s and are used by the National Bank as a venue for events. The building features sculpture by Guillaume de Groot, Jean Schoonjans and , and painted ceilings by Joseph Stallaert and .

The entire block was remodeled in the mid-20th century with a state-of-the-art complex built for the bank as part of the broader transportation and urban transformation project known as the North–South connection. Architect was appointed project architect on 1 February 1940, but the reconstruction process was suspended during the German occupation of Belgium during World War II and construction work only started in 1946. The new building features a 200-meters-long monumental Stripped Classicism façade on the / and a monumental banking hall. The initial plans foresaw the demolition of the , but preservationists won the decision to keep it standing in 1948. The construction works were eventually completed in 1958. The complex designed by Van Goethem includes the printing presses building on the other side of the Boulevard de Berlaimont, connected to the main headquarters by an underground tunnel. It features exterior sculpture by , including aluminium figures of Mercury, Minerva, and Vulcan above the bank&#x27;s entrance on the Boulevard de Berlaimont; and two bronze statues of kneeling women, respectively by George Grard on the southern side and to the north. In 2023, the National Bank announced plans for comprehensive renovation of its head office complex, on a design by firms and LOW Architecten, combined with the construction of a cash logistics center in Zellik, an outer northwestern suburb of Brussels.

In 1982, the National Bank opened its own museum in the . In 2018, the museum moved to new premises in the former 1872 headquarters of the , a cooperative bank, which the National Bank had purchased in 1979 and renovated in the 2000s.

==Branches==

The National Bank used to maintain branches and offices throughout the country as well as Luxembourg, reaching a total of 43 locations between 1936 and 1974. The branch in Antwerp was an opulent eclectic building designed by Hendrik Beyaert, the architect of the bank&#x27;s main office in Brussels, and completed in 1879. Most of these branches included a discount office (), technically a separate entity owned by local individuals which acted as a guarantor for paper discounted by the bank.

In Luxembourg, following a bilateral agreement of modifying the terms of the Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union, the National Bank on purchased an urban mansion that had been erected in 1882-1883 on a design by local architect , on 43 . After renovation, that building opened to the public on as the National Bank&#x27;s Luxembourg office (), was elevated in 1963 to the status of branch (), then closed on after the creation of the Central Bank of Luxembourg (BCL) had made it redundant. The BCL acquired the building on and had it demolished in 2003 to erect a new facility known as the Monterey Building, inaugurated in 2007.

The National Bank gradually shed its network of branches from 1974 onward, as they no longer served an operational purpose. The prominent Antwerp branch closed on , and was subsequently converted into commercial offices. The last two branches, in Kortrijk and Liège, were closed in 2018.

<text>London Levi Fletcher-Baker (born May 19, 1975) is an American former professional football linebacker who played for 16 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the St. Louis Rams, Buffalo Bills, and Washington Redskins. He played college football at John Carroll and signed with the Rams as an undrafted free agent in 1998. After four seasons with the Rams, he was a member of the Bills for five seasons and spent his last seven seasons with the Redskins. He won Super Bowl XXXIV with the Rams in 1999 and made four Pro Bowls during his Redskins tenure.

Fletcher never missed a game due to injury in his career, being one of only five players in NFL history to play in over 250 consecutive games and holding the record for most consecutive starts at linebacker. He finished his career with 215 consecutive games started, which ties him for seventh all-time along with Alan Page and Ronde Barber. He was named to the Washington&#x27;s Ring of Fame in 2019 and joined their radio broadcast crew in 2022. He is the current color commentator for the Washington Commanders radio broadcast team.

==Early life==
Fletcher attended Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School in Cleveland, Ohio, and won varsity letters in football and basketball. He played on two state championship basketball teams.

==College career==
While attending John Carroll University, Fletcher played both basketball and football for the John Carroll Blue Streaks. As a senior, he had 202 tackles (a school-record) and was named the Division III National Linebacker of the Year. Fletcher also attended Saint Francis University of Pennsylvania before transferring to John Carroll University. He was on the men&#x27;s basketball team while at Saint Francis.

==Professional career==
Fletcher attended the NFL Scouting Combine and ran a 4.38 in the 40-yard dash. He worked out for several NFL teams and was expected to be a day 2 selection, but was not one of the 30 linebackers drafted during the 1998 NFL draft.

===St. Louis Rams===
====1998====
On April 28, 1998, the St. Louis Rams signed Fletcher to a one-year, $158,000 contract as an undrafted free agent.
He made his professional regular season debut in the St. Louis Rams’ season-opening 24–17 loss against the New Orleans Saints. On December 27, 1998, Fletcher earned his first career start after Eric Hill sustained an injury. He made eight solo tackles on defense and seven special teams tackles as the Rams lost 38–19 at the San Francisco 49ers in a Week 17. Fletcher earned the Rams Rookie of the Year Award. He finished the season with 14 combined tackles (11 solo) in 16 games and one start.

====1999====
Throughout training camp, Fletcher competed against Charlie Clemons and Lorenzo Styles to be the starting middle linebacker after the Rams chose not to re-sign Eric Hill. Head coach Dick Vermeil named Fletcher the starting middle linebacker to begin the regular season, alongside outside linebacker Todd Collins and Mike Jones.

On October 3, 1999, Fletcher collected a season-high 11 combined tackles (nine solo) and made his first career sack during a 38–10 win at the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 3. Fletcher sacked Bengals’ quarterback Jeff Blake for a ten-yard loss during the third quarter. In Week 9, Fletcher recorded five combined tackles and earned his first career safety during a 31–27 loss at the Detroit Lions. Fletcher earned his safety by tackling running back Greg Hill in the endzone for a one-yard loss during the first quarter. Fletcher started in all 16 games in 1999 and recorded a total of 138 tackles on defense and special teams combined. His 138 tackles were the most by a Ram since Roman Phifer collected 149 tackles in the 1995. Fletcher recorded 90 combined tackles (66 solo), with three sacks, and one safety on defense.

The St. Louis Rams finished first in the NFC West with a 13–3 record and earned a first round bye. On January 16, 2000, Fletcher started in his first career playoff game and recorded 11 combined tackles (eight solo) and made one sack during a 49–37 victory against the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Divisional Round. The following week, he made nine combined tackles as the Rams defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 11–6 in the NFC Championship Game. On January 30, 2000, Fletcher started in Super Bowl XXXIV and recorded 11 combined tackles (nine solo) as the Rams defeated the Tennessee Titans 23–16. He also was named to the All-Madden team and as a second alternate to the Pro Bowl for the first time.

====2000====
On February 2, 2000, St. Louis Rams’ head coach Dick Vermeil announced his decision to retire. The St. Louis Rams promoted offensive coordinator Mike Martz to head coach. Martz retained Fletcher, Collins, and Jones as the starting linebackers. He started in the St. Louis Rams’ against the Denver Broncos and collected a season-high 14 combined tackles (nine solo) and made two sacks during their 41–36 victory. On November 12, 2000, Fletcher made six solo tackles, forced a fumble, and made his first career interception during a 38–24 at the New York Giants in Week 11. Fletcher intercepted a pass by Giants’ Kerry Collins, that was intended for wide receiver Ike Hilliard, and returned it for a 12-yard gain during the third quarter. In Week 13, Fletcher recorded seven combined tackles, was credited with half a sack, and made a season-high two interceptions during a 31–24 loss against the New Orleans Saints. He made both interceptions off pass attempts by Saints’ quarterback Aaron Brooks. In Week 15, he recorded ten combined tackles (nine solo) and two sacks during a 40–29 victory against the Minnesota Vikings. His performance earned him NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors. He led the team with 193 tackles on defense and special teams, eclipsing the old franchise mark of 185 set by LB Jim Collins in 1984. Fletcher recorded 132 combined tackles (105 solo) solely on defense and made four interceptions and 5.5 sacks in 16 games and 15 starts.

====2001====
In 2001, Fletcher earned NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors twice and was an alternate to the pro bowl for the third straight season. In a game against the San Francisco 49ers on September 23, he led the team with a career-high 21 tackles, 15 solo. The second time was after his big performance against the New England Patriots on November 18 as he led the team with 17 tackles with one pass deflection. He forced a fumble on the Rams’ three-yard line that led to a 97-yard scoring drive to end the first half and intercepted a Tom Brady pass with 5:18 left in the third quarter for an 18-yard return. This season, the Rams made the Super Bowl XXXVI but were defeated by the Patriots 20–17, after kicker Adam Vinatieri made a game-winning 48-yard field goal as time expired.

===Buffalo Bills===
On March 6, 2002, the Buffalo Bills signed Fletcher to a five-year, $17.12 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $4 million.

Starting in 2002, Fletcher started all 16 regular season games for the Bills until his last season in 2006, when he recorded a team-high 157 tackles, including nine for loss, set a career-high with 14 deflections and tied a career-high with four interceptions. On September 10, in the first regular season game, Fletcher scored his first career touchdown after recovering a fumble by the Patriots&#x27; Tom Brady and returning it five yards for a touchdown only 12 seconds into the game. Fletcher was named a 2007 Pro Bowl alternate in his last season as a member of the Bills.

===Washington Redskins===

On March 2, 2007, Fletcher signed with the Washington Redskins to a five-year, $25 million contract. He immediately became the team&#x27;s starting middle linebacker. With his first season on the team, he was named co-winner of the B.J. Blanchard Award, an honor given annually to a Redskins player who best helps the local media do their jobs, along with quarterback Jason Campbell. Fletcher continued his Pro Bowl-caliber run with the Redskins in 2008.

He was the Redskins&#x27; defensive co-captain for the team from 2008 season until he retired. Also in 2008, the Redskins nominated Fletcher as their Walter Payton Man of the Year Award representative.

Fletcher was named to the NFC squad in the 2010 Pro Bowl after Jonathan Vilma&#x27;s New Orleans Saints qualified for Super Bowl XLIV, the first Pro Bowl selection in his career. Fletcher was also one of three candidates for the 2009 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which was ultimately won by the Kansas City Chiefs&#x27;s Brian Waters.

After the Redskins&#x27; switch to a 3–4 defensive scheme, Fletcher moved from the middle linebacker position to the left inside linebacker for the 2010 season. He made the Pro Bowl for the second consecutive time in 2010, where he had an interception which set up a touchdown for the NFC.

Despite not making the 2012 Pro Bowl starting roster, Fletcher led the entire league in tackles with 166 tackles by the end of the 2011 season. He started all 16 games of the 2011 season and recorded 166 combined tackles, 1.5 sacks, two interceptions, and eight pass breakups. Fletcher, however, did make it as alternate for the 2012 Pro Bowl along with teammates, Brian Orakpo and Lorenzo Alexander. On January 9, 2012, Fletcher was added to the NFC 2012 Pro Bowl roster after Brian Urlacher confirmed that he would not be participating.
On January 11, 2012, it was announced that Fletcher won the Bart Starr Award. He was also named the Redskins&#x27; 2011 Defensive Player of the Year.
On April 13, 2012, Fletcher was re-signed by the Redskins to a two-year contract worth $10.75 million with $5.25 million guaranteed. He was given the 87th ranking in the NFL Network&#x27;s Top 100 Players of 2012 list. Despite the Redskins&#x27; 31–28 loss to the St. Louis Rams in Week 2 of the 2012 season, Fletcher had a stellar performance. In the game, he intercepted quarterback Sam Bradford in the endzone and forced running back Daryl Richardson to fumble in the fourth quarter and the ball was recovered by DeAngelo Hall, which gave the Redskins one last attempt to tie or win the game. In the Week 12 win against the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving, he recorded his second interception for the season making him one of three active NFL players, at that time, to have recorded 20 interceptions and 30 sacks, the other two being Brian Urlacher and Ray Lewis.
Fletcher intercepted Joe Flacco in Week 14 against the Baltimore Ravens. He had another interception, against Brandon Weeden, in the Redskins&#x27; win over the Cleveland Browns. He finished the season with 139 tackles, three sacks, and a career-high five interceptions.

There was doubt over whether Fletcher would return for the 2013 season until it was announced that he had surgery on his left ankle and was scheduled for elbow surgery to prepare for another season with the Redskins on March 6, 2013. On November 7, Fletcher started his 208th consecutive game, tying the league&#x27;s all-time record of most starts by a linebacker last held by retired linebacker Derrick Brooks.

On December 18, 2013, Fletcher announced his retirement. Fletcher finished his career having played in 256 consecutive games and starting 215 consecutive games, which is the NFL all-time record of consecutive starts at the linebacker position. He joined Washington&#x27;s radio broadcast crew in 2022. On September 1, 2022, Fletcher was inducted into Washington&#x27;s Greatest Players list in honor of the franchise&#x27;s 90th anniversary.

==Personal life==
Fletcher and his wife Charne have three children, two daughters, Paige and Brooke, and a son, Steele. Charne died from cancer in September 2024 at the age of 50.

Fletcher is a Christian. Fletcher spoke about his conversion to Christianity saying, &quot;I spent years chasing things I thought would bring me everlasting joy and happiness: chasing Super Bowl rings or a multi-million dollar contract; or a new house, cars and jewelry. None of those things did for me what Christ did in an instant.&quot;

Fletcher was named a Pro Bowl alternate 11 times during his career and did not play in his first one until the 2010 Pro Bowl via replacing Jonathan Vilma. As a result, Fletcher called himself the NFL version of Susan Lucci, who won a Daytime Emmy after 19 nominations.

<text>Kalhana () was the author of &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; (&quot;River of Kings&quot;), an account of the history of Kashmir. He wrote the work in Sanskrit between 1148 and 1149. All information regarding his life has to be deduced from his own writing, a major scholar of which is Mark Aurel Stein.

==Life==
Srëë Kalhandeva was born in a Hindu Brahmin family to a Kashmiri minister, Chanpaka, who probably served king Harsha of the Lohara dynasty. It is possible that his birthplace was Parihaspore and his birth would have been very early in the 12th century. The introductory verses to each of the eight Books in his &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; are prefaced with prayers to Shiva, a Hindu deity. In common with many Hindus in Kashmir at that time, he was also sympathetic to Buddhism, and Buddhists tended to reciprocate this feeling towards Hindus. Even in relatively modern times, Buddha&#x27;s birthday has been a notable event for Kashmiri Brahmins and well before Kalhana&#x27;s time Buddha had been accepted by Hindus as an avatar of Vishnu.

Kalhana was familiar with earlier epics such as the &quot;Vikramankadevacharita&quot; of Bilhana, the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, to all of which he alludes in his own writings. However, his own writings did not employ what Stein has described as &quot;the very redundant praise and flattery which by custom and literary tradition Indian authors feel obliged to bestow on their patrons&quot;. From this comes Stein&#x27;s deduction that Kalhana was not a part of the circle surrounding Jayasimha, the ruling monarch at the time when he was writing the &quot;Rajatarangini&quot;.

<text>Aaron Ross Schobel (; born September 1, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). Schobel played college football for the TCU Horned Frogs. He was selected by Buffalo in the second round (46th overall) of the 2001 NFL draft, and he played his entire nine-season career for the Bills. Schobel is notable for recording more sacks of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady than any other NFL player.

==Early life==
Schobel attended Columbus High School. While there, he was a two-time All-District-22-3A selection, at both tight end and outside linebacker. As a senior, he had 105 tackles and during his final two years, he posted 70 receptions for 1,299 yards (18.55 yards per rec. avg.).

==College career==
Aaron attended Texas Christian University, where he played for the TCU Horned Frogs football team from 1997 to 2000. He received first-team All-Western Athletic Conference (WAC) honors in 1999 and 2000, and was the WAC Defensive Player of the Year as a senior in 2000.

==Professional career==

Schobel earned his first Pro Bowl appearance in 2006. His best season as a pro came in 2006 when he posted a career high 14 sacks. Since the 2001 season he ranks second in total sacks, only behind Jason Taylor.

Schobel, a first-team alternate for the 2007 Pro Bowl, was called upon to relieve an injured Jason Taylor in the Pro Bowl. This was his second consecutive year in the Pro Bowl.

He started in 116 consecutive games with the Bills from 2003 until 2008, when he was on the inactive list for a game against the San Diego Chargers due to an injured foot. After a team-leading, 10-sack 2009 season, Schobel informed the Bills that he was considering retirement. To add on, new coach Gailey said that he was looking to switch from a 4–3 to 3-4 defense. It was reported by the Buffalo News on May 10, 2010, that Schobel &amp; his wife June had sold their Orchard Park house, further adding to the speculation of his impending departure from the Bills. On July 27, 2010, Aaron Schobel announced he was 70/30 on returning to the Bills.

On August 4, 2010, the Buffalo Bills released Aaron Schobel. He never signed with any other team; being released instead cemented his decision to retire, which he did on August 16.

==NFL career statistics==


==Personal life==
Aaron is the older brother of former NFL tight end Matt Schobel and cousin of former Jacksonville Jaguars defensive end Bo Schobel. Schobel and his wife, June have two sons, Brock and John, and one daughter, Erika.

<doc id="1241830" wikidata="Q6780258" url="?curid=1241830" title="Mary Martha Sherwood">
<text>Mary Martha Sherwood (née Butt; 6 May 177522 September 1851) was a nineteenth-century English children&#x27;s writer. Of her more than four hundred works, the best known include &quot;The History of Little Henry and his Bearer&quot; (1814) and the two series &quot;The History of Henry Milner&quot; (1822–1837) and &quot;The History of the Fairchild Family&quot; (1818–1847). Her evangelicalism permeated her early writings, but later works cover common Victorian themes such as domesticity. 

Mary Martha Butt married Captain Henry Sherwood and moved to India for eleven years. She converted to evangelical Christianity, opened schools for the children of army officers and local Indian children, adopted neglected or orphaned children, and founded an orphanage. She was inspired to write fiction for the children in the military encampments. Her work was well received in Britain, where the Sherwoods returned in 1816 for medical reasons. She opened a boarding school, edited a children&#x27;s magazine, and published hundreds of tracts, novels, and other works for children and the poor, which increased her popularity in both the United States and Britain. She died in 1851 in Twickenham, Middlesex.

Sherwood&#x27;s career included three periods: her romantic period (1795–1805), her evangelical period (1810), in which she produced her most popular and influential works, and her post-evangelical period (). Themes in her writing included &quot;her conviction of inherent human corruption&quot;, her belief that literature &quot;had a catechetical utility&quot; for every rank of society, her belief that &quot;the dynamics of family life&quot; should reflect central Christian principles, and her &quot;virulent&quot; anti-Catholicism. Sherwood was called &quot;one of the most significant authors of children&#x27;s literature of the nineteenth century&quot;. Her depictions of domesticity and ties with India may have influenced many young readers, but her work fell from favour as children&#x27;s literature broadened in the late nineteenth century. 
==Early life==
Mary Martha Butt was born on 6 May 1775 in Stanford-on-Teme, Worcestershire, the eldest daughter and second child of Martha Butt and Reverend George Butt, the chaplain in ordinary to George III. As a young child, before the age of six, Sherwood composed stories in her head before she could write and begged her mother to copy them down. Her brother was her constant companion. She was forced to stand in the stocks while doing her lessons:

Sherwood&#x27;s and her sister Lucy Lyttelton&#x27;s education was wide-ranging for girls in the late eighteenth century: Sherwood learnt Latin and Greek and was allowed to read freely in her father&#x27;s library. Sherwood states in her autobiography that by the age of thirteen, she had reached her full height, but her mother continued to dress her like a child, so she hid in the woods with a book and a doll. Despite her lonely childhood, she seems to have enjoyed attending Madame St. Quentin&#x27;s School for Girls at Reading Abbey, which was run by French émigrés and also attended by Jane Austen.

Sherwood spent some of her teenage years in Lichfield, where she enjoyed the company of the naturalist Erasmus Darwin, the educational reformer Richard Lovell Edgeworth, his daughter Maria Edgeworth, and the poet Anna Seward. Although she was intellectually stimulated by them, she was distressed by their lack of faith and later described Richard Edgeworth as an &quot;infidel&quot;. She also criticized Seward&#x27;s persona of the female author, writing in her autobiography that she would never model herself on a woman who wore a wig and accumulated male flatterers. She was determined to become a writer and her father encouraged her. When she was 17, her father helped her publish her first story, &quot;Traditions&quot; (1795).

When Sherwood&#x27;s father died in 1795, her family retired from active social life, since her mother preferred seclusion, and moved to Bridgnorth, Shropshire, into &quot;a somewhat uncomfortable house&quot; in the town&#x27;s High Street. At Bridgnorth Sherwood began writing sentimental novels; in 1802 she sold &quot;Margarita&quot; for £40 to Mr. Hazard of Bath, and &quot;The History of Susan Grey&quot;, a &quot;Pamela&quot;-like novel, for £10. She also taught at a local Sunday school.

==Marriage and India==
In 1799, Sherwood married her cousin, Captain Henry Sherwood. For several years, she accompanied her husband and his regiment, the 53rd Foot, on postings throughout Britain. In 1804, he was promoted to paymaster, which slightly improved their finances. In 1805 the regiment was ordered to India and the Sherwoods were forced to leave behind their first child, Mary Henrietta, with Sherwood&#x27;s mother and sister in England.

Sherwood&#x27;s four-month voyage to India was hard; she was pregnant again and the regiment&#x27;s ship was attacked by French warships. The Sherwoods stayed in India for eleven years, moving with the army and a growing family from Calcutta (Kolkata) to Dinapore (Danapur), Berhampore (Baharampur), Cawnpore (Kanpur) and Meerut. They had six children there: Henry (1805–1807), Lucy Martha (1807–1808), Lucy Elizabeth (1809–1835), Emily (1811–1833), Henry Martyn, who became a minister (181321 January 1912), and Sophia (born 1815). 

After the death of her second child, Henry, of whooping cough, Sherwood began to consider converting to evangelical Christianity. The missionary Henry Martyn (after whom she had named her sixth child) finally convinced her, but it was the chaplain to the company who first made her aware of her &quot;human depravity&quot; and need for redemption. After her conversion, she was anxious to pursue evangelical missionary work in India, but she first had to persuade the East India Company that its policy of religious neutrality was ill-conceived. The social and political support for missionary programmes in Britain eventually persuaded the company to approve her endeavours. Sherwood set up schools for the children of army officers and for the local Indian children attached to the camp. They were often taught in her home because no buildings were available. The first school began with 13 children and grew to over 40, with pupils ranging from the very young to adolescents; uneducated soldiers attended at times. Sherwood discovered that traditional British teaching materials did not appeal to children raised in India and so wrote her own Indian and army-themed stories, such as &quot;The History of Little Henry and his Bearer&quot; (1814) and &quot;The Memoirs of Sergeant Dale, his Daughter and the Orphan Mary&quot; (1815).

Sherwood adopted neglected or orphaned children from the camp. In 1807 she adopted a three-year-old who had been given too much medicinal gin and in 1808 a malnourished two-year-old. She found homes for those she could not adopt and founded an orphanage. In 1816, on medical advice, she and her family returned to Britain. Sherwood relates in her autobiography that she was continually ill in India; it was believed at the time that neither she nor her children could survive in a tropical climate.

==Return to Britain and death==
When the Sherwoods returned to Britain, they were financially strapped. Captain Sherwood, having been put on half-pay, opened a school in Henwick, Worcestershire. Relying on her fame as an author and her teaching experience in India, Sherwood decided to establish a boarding school for girls in Wick; it remained in operation for eight years. She taught English, French, astronomy, history, geography, grammar, writing and arithmetic. At the same time, she wrote hundreds of tracts, novels, and other works for children and the poor, increasing her popularity in both the United States and Britain. &quot;The History of Henry Milner&quot; (1822) was one of Sherwood&#x27;s most successful books; children sent her fan mail, begging her to write a sequel; one child sent her &quot;ornamental pens&quot; with which to do so. Babies were named after the hero. Sherwood published much of what she wrote in &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, a children&#x27;s periodical that she edited for over 20 years.

By the 1830s, the Sherwoods had become more prosperous and the family decided to travel to the European continent. The texts that Sherwood wrote following this trip reflect her exposure to French culture. She also embarked on a large and complex Old Testament project at this time, for which she learned Hebrew. To assist her, her husband assembled, over the course of ten years, a large Hebrew-English concordance. Sherwood&#x27;s autobiography provides few details of the last approximately forty years of her life, although even in her seventies, Sherwood wrote for four or five hours a day; many of the books were co-authored with Sherwood&#x27;s daughter, Sophia. According to M. Nancy Cutt, a Sherwood scholar, this joint authorship led to a &quot;watery sentimentality&quot; not evident in Sherwood&#x27;s earlier works as well as a greater emphasis on issues of class.

In 1849, the Sherwoods moved to Twickenham, Middlesex, and in December of that year Captain Sherwood died. Sherwood herself died almost two years later on 20 September 1851.

==Literary analysis==
Sherwood scholar M. Nancy Cutt has argued that Sherwood&#x27;s career divides into three periods: (1) her romantic period (1795–1805), in which she wrote a few sentimental novels, (2) her evangelical period (1810), in which she produced her most popular and influential works, and (3) her post-evangelical period (). Several underlying themes pervade most of Sherwood&#x27;s works through these periods: &quot;her conviction of inherent human corruption&quot;, her belief that literature &quot;had a catechetical utility&quot; for every rank of society, her belief that &quot;the dynamics of family life&quot; should reflect central Christian principles, and her &quot;virulent&quot; anti-Catholicism.

===Early writings: Sentimental novels===
Sherwood&#x27;s earliest works are the sentimental novels &quot;Traditions&quot; (1795) and &quot;Margarita&quot; (1795). Both are more worldly than her later works, but neither received much recognition. By contrast, &quot;The History of Susan Gray&quot;, written for the girls of her Sunday school class in Bridgnorth, made Sherwood a famous author. Like Hannah More&#x27;s tracts, it is designed to teach middle-class morality to the poor. This novel, which children&#x27;s literature scholar Patricia Demers, describes as a &quot;purified &quot;Pamela&quot;&quot;, tells the story of Susan, an orphaned servant girl who &quot;resists the advances of a philandering soldier; though trembling with emotion at the man&#x27;s declaration of love and promise of marriage&quot;. Susan&#x27;s story is told from her deathbed, so the reader is regularly reminded of the &quot;wages of sin&quot;. A separate narrator, seemingly Sherwood, often interrupts the tale to warn readers against particular actions, such as deceiving themselves that God will spare &quot;bad women&quot; because there are so many of them. Despite a didactic tone that is often distasteful to modern readers, &quot;Susan Gray&quot; was so popular at the time of its publication that it was pirated by several publishers. In 1816, Sherwood published a revised version, which Sarah Trimmer reviewed positively in &quot;The Guardian of Education&quot;. Sherwood wrote a companion story to &quot;Susan Gray&quot;, &quot;The History of Lucy Clare&quot;, which was published in 1810.

===French literary influences===
Although Sherwood disagreed with the principles espoused by French Revolutionaries, her own works are modelled on French children&#x27;s literature, much of it infused with Rousseauvian ideals. For example, in &quot;The History of Henry Milner, PartI&quot; (1822) and &quot;The History of the Fairchild Family, PartI&quot; (1818), Sherwood adopts Arnaud Berquin&#x27;s &quot;habitual pattern of small domestic situations acted out by children under the eye of parents or fellows&quot;. Likewise, &quot;The Lady of the Manor&quot; (1823–1829) shares similar themes and structures with Madame de Genlis&#x27; &quot;Tales of the Castle&quot; (1785). David Hanson, a scholar of nineteenth-century literature, has questioned this interpretation, arguing that the tales told by the maternal figure in &quot;The Lady of the Manor&quot; demonstrate a &quot;distrust of parents&quot;, and of mothers in particular, because they illustrate the folly of overly permissive parenting. In these inset stories, only outsiders discipline children correctly.

One of Sherwood&#x27;s aims in her evangelically-themed &quot;The History of Henry Milner&quot; (1822–1837) was to challenge what she saw as the irreligion inherent in French pedagogy. &quot;Henry Milner&quot; was written in response to Thomas Day&#x27;s &quot;The History of Sandford and Merton&quot; (1783–1789), a novel founded on the philosophy of Rousseau (whose writings Sherwood had lambasted as &quot;the well-spring of infidelity&quot;). The children&#x27;s literature scholar Janis Dawson indicates that the structure and emphasis of &quot;Henry&quot; much resemble Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1762): their pedagogies are similar, even if their underlying assumptions about childhood conflict. Both books isolate the child in order to encourage learning from the natural world, but Sherwood&#x27;s Henry is naturally depraved, while Rousseau&#x27;s Emile is naturally good. As the series progressed, Sherwood&#x27;s views of religion changed (she became a universalist), causing her to place greater emphasis on childhood innocence in later volumes.

===Evangelicalism===
The strongest themes in Sherwood&#x27;s early evangelical writings are the need to recognize one&#x27;s innate &quot;depravity&quot; and the need to prepare for eternity. For Sherwood, her main themes emphasize &quot;faith, resignation, and implicit obedience to the will of God&quot;. In her adaptation of John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1678), &quot;The Infant&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1821), she represents original sin as a child named &quot;In-bred Sin&quot; who tempts the young pilgrims on their way to the Celestial City (Heaven). It is these battles with In-bred Sin that constitute the major conflict of the text. The allegory is complex and, as Demers admits, &quot;tedious&quot; for even the &quot;willing reader&quot;. According to Demers, &quot;some young readers may have found [In-bred Sin&#x27;s] activities more interesting than the spiritual struggles of the little heroes, reading the book as an adventure story rather than as a guide to salvation&quot;. Such religious allegory, though not always so overt, continued to be a favourite literary device of Sherwood&#x27;s.

Sherwood infused her works with political and social messages dear to evangelicals in the 1810s and 1820s, such as the crucial role of missions, the value of charity, the evils of slavery, and the need for Sabbath observance. She wrote biblically-based introductions to astronomy and ancient history so that children would have Christian textbooks. As Cutt argues, &quot;the intent of these (as indeed of all Evangelical texts) was to offset the deistic tendency to consider knowledge an end in itself&quot;. She revised classic children&#x27;s books on religious grounds, such as Sarah Fielding&#x27;s &quot;The Governess&quot; (1749). These efforts to make religion more palatable through children&#x27;s fiction were not always seen favourably by the evangelical community; &quot;The Evangelical Magazine&quot; reviewed harshly her &quot;Stories Explanatory of the Church Catechism&quot; (1817), complaining it was overly reliant on exciting fictional tales to convey its religious message.

====&quot;The History of the Fairchild Family&quot; (1818–1847)====

As Cutt argues, &quot;the great overriding metaphor of all [Sherwood&#x27;s] work is the representation of divine order by the harmonious family relationship (inevitably set in its own pastoral Eden)... No writer made it clearer to her readers that the child who is dutiful within his family is blessed in the sight of God; or stressed more firmly that family bonds are but the earthly and visible end of a spiritual bond running up to the very throne of God&quot;. Demers has referred to this &quot;consciously double vision&quot; as the quintessentially Romantic element of Sherwood&#x27;s writing. 

Of all Sherwood&#x27;s evangelically themed books, &quot;The History of the Fairchild Family&quot; was the most popular. It was published by John Hatchard of Piccadilly, which gave it and the other ten other books published with him a &quot;social distinction&quot; not attached to her other publications. The &quot;Fairchild Family&quot; tells the story of a family striving towards godliness and consists of a series of lessons taught by the Fairchild parents to their three children (Emily, Lucy and Henry) regarding not only the proper orientation of their souls towards Heaven but also the right earthly morality (envy, greed, lying, disobedience, and fighting are immoral). The overarching narrative of the tale includes a series of tract-like stories that illustrate these moral lessons. For example, stories of the deaths of two neighbourhood children, Charles Trueman and Miss Augusta Noble, help the Fairchild children to understand how and why they need to look to the state of their own hearts. The faithful and &quot;true&quot; Charles has a transcendent deathbed experience, suggesting he is saved; by contrast, the heedless, disobedient Augusta burns up while playing with candles and is presumably damned. Unlike previous allegorical literature with these themes, such as Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, Sherwood domesticated her story with actions in the children&#x27;s day-to-day lives, such as stealing fruit. These are important because they relate directly to their salvation. Each chapter includes thematically linked prayers and hymns, by Philip Doddridge, Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley, William Cowper, Ann and Jane Taylor, and others.

&quot;The Fairchild Family&quot; remained in print until 1913, despite the increasingly popular Wordsworthian image of childhood innocence. Dickensian scholar Lois E. Chaney has suggested that it &quot;influenced Dickens&#x27;s depictions of Pip&#x27;s fears of the convict, the gibbet, and &#x27;the horrible young man&#x27; at the close of Chapter 1&quot; in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1860–1861). The children&#x27;s literature scholar Gillian Avery has argued that &quot;The Fairchild Family&quot; was &quot;as much a part of English childhood as &quot;Alice&quot; was later to become&quot;. Although the book was popular, some scraps of evidence have survived suggesting that readers did not always interpret it as Sherwood would have wanted. Lord Frederic Hamilton writes, for instance, that &quot;there was plenty about eating and drinking; one could always skip the prayers, and there were three or four very brightly written accounts of funerals in it&quot;. Although &quot;The Fairchild Family&quot; has gained a reputation in the twentieth century as didactic, in the early nineteenth century it was viewed as delightfully realistic. Charlotte Mary Yonge (1823–1901), a critic who also wrote children&#x27;s literature, praised &quot;the gusto with which [Sherwood] dwells on new dolls&quot; and &quot;the absolutely sensational naughtiness&quot; of the children. Most twentieth-century critics, including George Orwell, who called it &quot;an evil book&quot;, have condemned the book&#x27;s harshness, pointing to the Fairchilds&#x27; moral-filled visit to a gibbet with a rotting corpse swinging from it; but Cutt and others argue that the positive depiction of the nuclear family in the text, particularly Sherwood&#x27;s emphasis on parents&#x27; responsibility to educate their own children, was important to the book&#x27;s appeal. She argues that Sherwood&#x27;s &quot;influence&quot;, through books such as the &quot;Fairchild Family&quot;, &quot;upon the domestic pattern of Victorian life can hardly be overestimated&quot;.

&quot;The Fairchild Family&quot; was so successful that Sherwood wrote two sequels, in 1842 and 1847. These reflected her changing values as well as those of the Victorian period. Significantly, the servants in PartI, &quot;who are almost part of the family, are pushed aside in PartIII by their gossiping, flattering counterparts in the fine manor-house.&quot; The most extensive thematic change in the series was the disappearance of evangelicalism. Whereas all the lessons in PartI highlight the children&#x27;s &quot;human depravity&quot; and encourage the reader to think in terms of the afterlife, in Parts IIand III, other Victorian values such as &quot;respectability&quot; and filial obedience come to the fore. Dawson describes the difference in terms of parental indulgence; in Parts II and III, the Fairchild parents employ softer disciplinary tactics than in PartI.

====Evangelical tract literature in the 1820s and 1830s====
During the 1820s and 1830s, Sherwood wrote a great many tracts for the poor. Like her novels for the middle class, they &quot;taught the lessons of personal endurance, reliance on Providence, and acceptance of one&#x27;s earthly status&quot;. Emphasizing individual experience and one&#x27;s personal relationship with God, they discouraged readers from attributing their successes or failures to &quot;larger economic and political forces&quot;. In this, they resembled the &quot;Cheap Repository Tracts&quot;, many written by Hannah More. As Linda Peterson, a scholar of nineteenth-century women&#x27;s literature, argues, Sherwood&#x27;s tracts use a Biblical &quot;interpretative frame&quot; to highlight the fleetingness of earthly things. For example, in &quot;A Drive in the Coach through the Streets of London&quot; (1819), Julia is granted the privilege of shopping with her mother only if she will &quot;behave wisely in the streets&quot; and &quot;not give [her] mind to self-pleasing&quot;. She cannot keep this promise and she eagerly peeks in at every store window and begs her mother to buy her everything she sees. Her mother, therefore, allows her to select one item from every shop. Julia, ecstatic, chooses blue satin boots, a penknife, and a new hat with flowers, and other items until the pair reach the undertaker&#x27;s shop. There her mood droops considerably and she realizes the moral of the lesson, recited by her mother, as she picks out a coffin: &quot;but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth&quot; (1 Timothy 5:6).

====Anti-Catholicism in the 1830s====
Sherwood&#x27;s anti-Catholicism appears most obviously in her works from the 1820s and 1830s. During the 1820s in Britain, Catholics were agitating for greater civil rights and it was at this time that Sherwood wrote her most sustained attacks against them. When the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 was passed, Sherwood and many like her were frightened of the influence Catholics might gain in the government and wrote &quot;Victoria&quot; (1833), &quot;The Nun&quot; (1833), and &quot;The Monk of Cimies&quot; (1834) to illustrate some of the supposed dangers of Catholicism. &quot;The Monk&quot; narrates, in the first person, Edmund Etherington&#x27;s decision to renounce the Church of England and join the Catholic church. While a monk, he ridicules his fellow brothers, plans a murder and debauches a young woman. Some evangelicals disagreed with her views on Catholic Emancipation and were uncomfortable with these books; one evangelical reviewer called &quot;The Monk of Cimies&quot; &quot;unfair and unconvincing&quot;.

===Colonialism===

While in India, Sherwood wrote a series of texts based on colonial life. Her most popular, &quot;The History of Little Henry and his Bearer&quot; (1814), tells of a young British boy who, on his deathbed, converts Boosy, the Indian man who has taken care of him throughout his childhood. The book was enormously successful; it reached 37 editions by 1850 and was translated into French, German, Spanish, Hindustani, Chinese, and Sinhalese. Sherwood&#x27;s tale blends the realistic with the sentimental and introduces her readers to Hindustani words and descriptions of what she felt was authentic Indian life. As Cutt explains, &quot;With this work, the obituary tract (which invariably stressed conversion and a Christian death) had assumed the colouring of romance.&quot; Sherwood also wrote a companion story titled &quot;Little Lucy and her Dhaye&quot; (1825) that told a similar tale.

&quot;The Indian Pilgrim&quot; (1818) demonstrates Sherwood&#x27;s religious biases: &quot;Muslims and Jews receive better treatment than Hindus because of their belief in one God, but Roman Catholics fare little better than the Hindu idolaters.&quot; &quot;The Indian Pilgrim&quot;, though never published in India, was popular in Britain and America. Sherwood also wrote texts for Indian servants of British families in the style of British writings for the poor. One such was &quot;The Ayah and Lady&quot; (1813) in which the &quot;ayah&quot; or maid is &quot;portrayed as sly, selfish, lazy, and untrustworthy. Her employers are well aware of her faults, yet they tolerate her&quot;. A more culturally sensitive and realistic portrayal of Indians appears in &quot;The Last Days of Boosy&quot; (1842), a sequel to &quot;The History of Little Henry and his Bearer&quot;, where the converted Boosy is cast out of his family and community after his conversion to Christianity.

Sherwood&#x27;s writings on India reveal her sense of superiority over the inhabitants of India; the subcontinent therefore appears in her works as a morally corrupt land in need of reformation. She wrote &quot;The History of George Desmond&quot; (1821) to warn young men of the dangers of emigrating to India. Sherwood&#x27;s books shaped the minds of several generations of young Britons. According to Cutt, Sherwood&#x27;s depictions of India were among the few available to young British readers; such children &quot;acquired a strong conviction of the rightness of missions, which, while it inculcated sincere concern for, and a genuine kindness towards an alien people for whom Britain was responsible, quite destroyed any latent respect for Indian tradition.&quot; 

Using a postcolonial analysis, Nandini Bhattacharya emphasizes the complex relationship between Sherwood&#x27;s evangelicalism and her colonialism. She argues that Sherwood&#x27;s evangelical stories demonstrate the deep colonial &quot;mistrust of feminized agency&quot;, represented by a dying child in &quot;Little Henry and his Bearer&quot;. Henry &quot;subvert[s] the colonialist&#x27;s fantasy of universal identity by generating a subaltern identity that mimics and explodes that fantasy&quot;. But ultimately, Bhattacharya argues, Sherwood creates neither a wholly colonialist text nor a post-colonial text; the deaths of children such as Henry eliminate any possibility for an alternative consciousnesses to mature.

===Later writings: Victorianism===
By 1830, Sherwood&#x27;s works had drifted from evangelicalism and reflected more conventional Victorian plots and themes. For example, &quot;Gipsy Babes&quot; (1826), perhaps inspired by Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Guy Mannering&quot; (1815), emphasizes &quot;human affections&quot;. In 1835, she wrote a Gothic novel for adolescents entitled &quot;Shanty the Blacksmith,&quot; which Cutt calls &quot;a gripping [and] exciting tale&quot; and employs the tropes of the genre: &quot;lost heir, ruined castle, humble helpers and faithful retainer, sinister and mysterious gypsies, prisoner and plot&quot;. In 1835, Sherwood published the novel &quot;Caroline Mordaunt&quot;, about a young woman forced to become a governess. Her parents die when she is young, but luckily relatives pay to educate her, so she can earn her own living. It follows her progress from a flighty, discontented girl to a reliable, content woman; she learns to accommodate herself to the whims of a proud nobility, silly literati, and dogmatic evangelicals. She realizes that in her dependent position she must be content with less than complete happiness. Once she recognizes this, though, she finds God, and in the last chapter an ideal husband, so granting her near-complete happiness after all. Cutt suggests that in these works, Sherwood drew on Jane Austen and Jane Taylor for a new &quot;lively, humorous, and satirical strain&quot;.

In both later works such as &quot;Caroline Mordaunt&quot; and her earlier evangelical texts, Sherwood followed the Victorian project of prescribing gender roles; while her later works outlined ever more stringent and narrow roles for each sex, her early works such as &quot;The Fairchild Family&quot; suggested demarcations as well: Lucy and Emily learn to sew and keep house while Henry tends the garden and learns Latin.

==Legacy==
As Britain&#x27;s education system became more secular in the later nineteenth century, Sherwood&#x27;s evangelical books were used mainly to teach the poor and in Sunday schools. Her missionary stories were the most influential of all her works, for according to Cutt, they &quot;kept alive the missionary spirit and perpetuated that paternal attitude towards India that lasted into the [twentieth century], were widely imitated&quot; and &quot;an unfortunate assumption of racial superiority was fostered by the over-simplification of some of Mrs. Sherwood&#x27;s successors&quot;. They influenced Charlotte Maria Tucker (&quot;A.L.O.E.&quot;) and even perhaps Rudyard Kipling. In the United States, Sherwood&#x27;s early works were popular and republished well into the 1840s; thereafter a tradition of specifically American children&#x27;s literature began to develop with authors such as Louisa May Alcott. Sherwood was also instrumental in developing the ideology of the Victorian family. Cutt acknowledges that &quot;the omniscient Victorian parent was not the creation of Mrs. Sherwood, but of the Victorians themselves; nevertheless, by presenting the parent as God&#x27;s vicar in the family, she had planted and fostered the idea&quot;. 

The prevalence of death in Sherwood&#x27;s early stories and vivid portrayal of its worldly and otherworldly consequences have often caused twentieth-century critics to deride her works. However, Sherwood&#x27;s stories influenced the styles for other writers such as Charles Kingsley and Charlotte Mary Yonge. It has been surmised that John Ruskin used &quot;Henry Milner&quot; as the basis for his imaginative autobiography &quot;Praeterita&quot; (1885–1889). Sherwood&#x27;s narrative experiments with various genres allowed other writers to pursue innovative forms of children&#x27;s fiction. Her imaginative use of tracts domesticated reformist literature and encouraged radicals such as Harriet Martineau to employ the same genre, although for opposite purposes. Due to the popularity of Sherwood&#x27;s works and their impact on later writers, Janis Dawson writes: &quot;Though her books are no longer widely read, she is regarded as one of the most significant authors of children&#x27;s literature of the nineteenth century&quot;.

<text>Ephraim Williams Jr. ( – September 8, 1755) was an American landowner and militia officer from the Province of Massachusetts Bay who was killed in the French and Indian War. Born in Newton, Massachusetts, he was the benefactor of Williams College, located in northwestern Massachusetts. The school&#x27;s athletic programs, the Ephs, are named after Williams.

==Life==

===Early life===
Ephraim Jr. was the eldest son of Ephraim Williams Sr. and Elizabeth Jackson Williams (d. 1718). He was born in Newton, Massachusetts, on February 24, 1714, and was raised by his maternal grandparents after his mother died giving birth to a second son, Thomas, in 1718. His family was influential in western Massachusetts; they were preeminent in a group of families then called the &quot;River Gods&quot; (referencing the Connecticut River, the major waterway in the area). A cousin, Israel Williams, was known as the &quot;monarch of Hampshire&quot; due to his singular influence along the river.

[&quot;I give and bequeath...all the Buildings and Appurtenances therunto belongings with all the stock of Cattle and Negro Servants now upon [his homestead in Stockbridge&quot;]
In his youth, Ephraim Jr. was a sailor and travelled several times to Europe, visiting England, Holland and Spain.

===Military service===
In 1742, at age 27, he moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where his father had relocated on land purchased from the Mahican tribe, and purchased large tracts of land in the young settlement. He joined the militia and was commissioned captain.

In 1745 during King George&#x27;s War (1745–1748), he was put in charge of building and defending Fort Massachusetts and the line of defences in western Connecticut and Massachusetts. He was absent when the fort was taken and destroyed by the French in August 1746. After the war ended, Williams spent considerable effort urging the settlement of new townships in the western portion of Massachusetts along the Hoosac River at the end of the 1740s. Many of the early settlers in this region were soldiers stationed at Fort Massachusetts during the war, including Williams himself.

However, within just a few years, Williams was again called into service as part of the French and Indian War (1754–1763). Williams, now a colonel, took part in William Johnson&#x27;s expedition against Crown Point, New York, leading a regiment of ten companies. Among those companies were Burke&#x27;s Rangers and Rogers&#x27; Rangers. Among his aides was William Williams from Connecticut, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.

Williams was shot in the head and killed during an ambush by the French and their Indian allies in the Battle of Lake George on September 8, 1755, at the age of 40. Members of his regiment hid his body after the battle to prevent it from being desecrated. They later buried Williams nearby. His body was disinterred in the early 20th century and moved to the chapel at Williams College. A stone etched with Williams&#x27; initials on it and the year of his death still stands at the original Lake George gravesite just across the street from a monument erected by Williams College alumni. The monument marks the site of the ambush, which was called the Bloody Morning Scout.

==Legacy==
Ephraim left his sizeable estate to support the founding of a free school on his land in western Massachusetts, on the conditions that the town be renamed after him (Williamstown, Massachusetts, formerly West Hoosac), that the town be part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and that the free school be built on the land which he donated. He previously intended to found the school as an academy for &quot;the Promoting &amp; propogating [sic] Christian knowledge amongst the Indians at Stockbridge&quot; but was deterred by the potential of the project being manipulated by his political rivals after his death. The school was founded in 1791 and converted to Williams College by action of the state legislature in 1793.

Ebenezer Fitch, the first president of Williams College, wrote a biographical sketch of Ephraim Jr. in 1802. He described the college&#x27;s benefactor as follows: &quot;In his person, he was large and fleshy...His address was easy, and his manners pleasing and conciliating. Affable and facetious, he could make himself agreeable in all companies; and was very generally esteemed, respected, and beloved.&quot;

There is some internet based commentary that suggests Ephraim Williams appears in an early version of &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;:

:Brother Ephraim sold his Cow
:And bought him a Commission;
:And then he went to Canada
:To fight for the Nation;

:But when Ephraim he came home
:He proved an arrant Coward,
:He wouldn&#x27;t fight the Frenchmen there
:For fear of being devour&#x27;d.

However, this suggestion comes mostly from on-line commentators, who &quot;just repeat earlier questionable, undocumented interpretations&quot; without citation, and no reputable scholars &quot;connect this &#x27;arrant Coward&#x27; to the French and Indian War hero.&quot;

The song &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; was re-appropriated by the British colonists from the derisive version of the Dutch settlers and turned into a rousing marching tune eventually making Yankee another name for American known world wide, with the first known version of the song apparently about Ephraim Williams, who fought the French at the battle of Fort Ticonderoga and the Battle of the Bloody Morning Scout.

<text>Joseph Henry Shorthouse (9 September 1834 – 4 March 1903) was an English novelist. His first novel, &quot;John Inglesant&quot;, was particularly admired as a &quot;philosophical romance&quot;. It discusses a religious intrigue in the English 17th century.

==Biography==
Shorthouse was born in Great Charles Street, Birmingham, on 9 September 1834, as the eldest of three sons of Joseph Shorthouse (1797–1880) and his wife, Mary Ann, née Hawker. He grew up in Calthorpe Street, Edgbaston. His father had inherited a family chemical works manufacturing vitriol, and his mother&#x27;s father had founded the first glasshouse in Birmingham. Both families were Quakers. He was educated partly at home and partly at Grove House School, Tottenham, and became a chemical manufacturer.

At the Friends meeting house in Warwick on 19 August 1857, he married a childhood friend, Sarah Scott (1832–1909), the eldest daughter of John and Elizabeth Scott. Two events of importance ensued. He and his wife joined the Church of England in 1861, and he had the first of many attacks of epilepsy in January 1862. Shorthouse later identified himself with &quot;the new Oxford school of High Churchmen&quot;, but he preferred the freedom and reason of the Anglican church to the authority over private judgement that he saw exercised by Roman Catholicism.

Shorthouse&#x27;s health began to deteriorate in 1900 and he died at his home, 60 Wellington Road, Edgbaston, on 4 March 1903. He left no children.

==&quot;John Inglesant&quot;==
Shorthouse spent ten years up to 1876 working on his first book, &quot;John Inglesant&quot;, which initially appeared privately. It was eventually noticed by Mrs Humphry Ward and through her intervention by Alexander Macmillan, who published it commercially in 1881. A story of 17th-century religious intrigue and faith, it hinges on a man who fights on the Royalist side in the Civil War, moves between Anglican and Catholic circles, and forgives the man who murdered his brother. However, as an encyclopedist notes, &quot;Its revenge plot – in which Inglesant pursues his brother&#x27;s murderer – is less important than the hero&#x27;s spiritual journey and assertion of the claims of the Anglican Church.&quot;

The book at once made Shorthouse famous. Though said to be deficient in its structure as a story and unappealing to the general public, it fascinated people by the charm of its style, by a &quot;dim religious light&quot;, with which it was suffused, and by occasional striking scenes. More recently it has been described as &quot;one of the best examples of the philosophical romance in English literature&quot;.

Shorthouse dedicated &quot;John Inglesant&quot; to Rawdon Levett, his friend and fellow teacher at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham. Other admirers of the work included T. H. Huxley, Charlotte Yonge and Edmund Gosse. He was invited to breakfast at 10 Downing Street by the Prime Minister, Gladstone. The book sold 9000 copies in its first year.

==Other works==
Shorthouse&#x27;s other novels, &quot;The Little Schoolmaster Mark&quot; (1883), &quot;Sir Percival&quot; (1886), &quot;The Countess Eve&quot; (1888), &quot;A Teacher of the Violin&quot; (1888) and &quot;Blanche, Lady Falaise&quot; (1891) have some of the same characteristics, but were less successful than the first. Shorthouse also wrote literary essays, including one called &quot;The Platonism of Wordsworth&quot;.

The &quot;Life, Letters, and Literary Remains of J. H. Shorthouse&quot; were edited by the author&#x27;s wife and published in 1905. A biographical study of Shorthouse appeared in 1995.

<text>It Ain&#x27;t Easy is the fourth album by American rock band Three Dog Night, released in 1970.

== Title and packaging ==
According to lead singer Chuck Negron&#x27;s book &quot;Three Dog Nightmare&quot;, the album&#x27;s working title was &quot;The Wizards of Orange&quot;, with a cover featuring the band&#x27;s members wearing orange make-up and posing in the nude. The band&#x27;s record company, ABC/Dunhill, rejected the original album title and cover art, although some configurations of their first &quot;greatest hits&quot; album, 1971&#x27;s &quot;Golden Bisquits&quot;, would later be packaged using &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot;&#x27;s original cover photo.

== Critical reception ==

Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;Admitting it won&#x27;t gain me any of the hip cachet I crave, but I admired and enjoyed this group&#x27;s first LP. I found the second mediocre and the live job that followed it wretchedly excessive, but this one—their fourth in just fourteen months—gets back: exemplary song-finding and not too much plastic-soul melon-mouthing or preening vocal pyrotechnique. Highlights: the hit version of Randy Newman&#x27;s &#x27;Mama Told Me Not to Come,&#x27; with just the right admixture of high-spirited schlock to turn it into the AM giant it deserves to be, and a departure from pre-Beatles times called &quot;Good Feeling (1957).&quot;

<doc id="1241838" wikidata="Q3431220" url="?curid=1241838" title="Richard Sibbes">
<text>Richard Sibbes (or Sibbs) (1577–1635) was an Anglican theologian. He is known as a Biblical exegete, and as a representative, with William Perkins and John Preston, of what has been called &quot;main-line&quot; Puritanism because he always remained in the Church of England and worshiped according to the Book of Common Prayer.

==Life==
He was born in Tostock, Suffolk, where his father was a wheelwright; other sources say Sudbury. After attending Bury St Edmunds Grammar School, he attended St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge from 1595. He was lecturer at Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge, from 1610 or 1611 to 1615 or 1616. It was erroneously held by 18th and 19th century scholars that Sibbes was deprived of his various academic posts on account of his Puritanism. In fact he was never deprived of any of his posts, due to his ingenuity of the system.

He was then preacher at Gray&#x27;s Inn, London, from 1617, returning to Cambridge as Master of Catherine Hall in 1626, without giving up the London position.

Also in 1626, the support group known as the Feoffees for Impropriations was set up, and Sibbes was a founding member. (It built on an informal grouping dating back to 1613). It was closely linked to St Antholin, Budge Row, for its seven years of existence: it was shut down in 1633. With others, he worked to fund and provide platforms for preachers. He was one of four ministers in the original feoffees, the other members being chosen as four lawyers and four laymen.

==Works==

He was the author of several devotional works expressing intense religious feeling – &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Cordial&quot; (1629), &quot;The Bruised Reed and Smoking Flax&quot; (1631, exegesis of Isaiah 42:3), &quot;The Soules Conflict&quot; (1635), etc.

A volume of sermons appeared in 1630, dedicated to Horace Vere, 1st Baron Vere of Tilbury and his wife Lady Mare. Most of the other works were first published by Thomas Goodwin and Philip Nye, after Sibbes died. The content belied the mainly moderate and conforming attitudes for which Sibbes was known in his lifetime. &quot;Beames of Divine Light&quot;, &quot;A Description of Christ in Three Sermons&quot; and &quot;Bowels Opened&quot; appeared in 1639, as did &quot;The Returning Backslider&quot;, sermons on the &quot;Book of Hosea&quot;.

A complete edition was published 1862–1864 in Edinburgh, in seven volumes, by James Nichol, with a biographical memoir by Alexander Grosart.

==Views==

The clerical leaders of the Feoffees, Davenport, Gouge and Sibbes, all adhered to Calvinist covenant theology, as shaped by the English theologians Perkins, Preston, William Ames, and Thomas Taylor. There was a tacit assumption of a state church. Sibbes believed the Second Coming was necessary to complete the work that Christ had begun.

Efforts to define further the Puritanism of Sibbes – which is a term much debated – place him in various groups. Under pious &quot;non-separatists&quot;, he is with Preston, Richard Baxter, Robert Bolton, and John Dod. Under those who would conform to set forms of worship, he is with Dod, Nicholas Byfield, Richard Capel, John Downame, Arthur Hildersham, and Richard Stock (another Feoffee). He is also a fully conforming Puritan, with Preston, Samuel Ward, and Robert Hill. With Richard Bernard, he was a moderate Calvinist who promoted religious tolerance. With Perkins, Preston, Baxter and Henry Newcome, he was a moderate and non-Presbyterian Puritan. However one classifies him, it is undeniable that he was a faithful member of the Elizabethan church.

His perspective was European, or even wider, and he saw Catholicism in terms of a repressive conspiracy. With Davenport, Gouge, Taylor, Thomas Gataker, John Stoughton, and Josias Shute, he helped raise money for Protestants of the Electorate of the Palatinate affected by the opening of the Thirty Years&#x27; War; and later for John Dury&#x27;s missions. Laud brought up Sibbes, Davenport, Gouge and Taylor in front of the Court of High Commission for this. &quot;The Fountain Opened&quot; (1638) advocated mission work.

==Quotes==
* “There is more mercy in Christ than sin in us.”

==Influence==

His works were much read in New England. Thomas Hooker, prominent there from 1633, was directly influenced by Sibbes, and his &quot;espousal theology&quot;, using marriage as a religious metaphor, draws on &quot;The Bruised Reed&quot; and &quot;Bowels Opened&quot;.

The poet George Herbert was a contemporary, and there are suggestions on parallels. Where Herbert speaks in &quot;The Church Militant&quot; about the westward movement of the propagation of the gospel, Christopher Hill comments that this may have come from &quot;The Bruised Reed&quot;. Other examples have been proposed by Doerksen.

Sibbes was cited by the Methodist John Wesley. The Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon studied his craft in Sibbes, Perkins and Thomas Manton. The evangelical Martyn Lloyd-Jones wrote in the highest terms of his own encounter with the work of Sibbes.

<doc id="1241843" wikidata="Q4418695" url="?curid=1241843" title="Lydia Sigourney">
<text>Lydia Huntley Sigourney (September 1, 1791 – June 10, 1865), Lydia Howard Huntley, was an American poet, author, and publisher during the early and mid 19th century. She was commonly known as the &quot;Sweet Singer of Hartford.&quot; She had a long career as a literary expert, publishing 52 books and in over 300 periodicals in her lifetime. While some of her works were signed anonymously, most of her works were published with just her married name Mrs. Sigourney. During the lyceum movement that flourished in the United States in the 19th century, women named literary societies and study clubs in her honor.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mrs. Sigourney was born in Norwich, Connecticut, to Ezekiel Huntley and Zerviah Wentworth. Their only child, she was named after her father&#x27;s first wife, Lydia Howard, who had died soon after marrying Ezekiel. In her autobiography &quot;Letters of Life&quot;, Sigourney describes her relation to her parents, her decision to care for them, and her intent to avoid marriage because it would interfere with this relationship.

I had ... reason for avoiding serious advances. My mind was made up never to leave my parents. I felt that their absorbing love could never be repaid by the longest life-service, and that the responsibility of an only child, their sole prop and solace, would be strictly regarded by Him who readeth the heart. I had seen aged people surrounded by indifferent persons, who considered their care a burden, and could not endure the thought that my tender parents, who were without near relatives, should be thrown upon the fluctuating kindness of hirelings and strangers. To me, my father already seemed aged, though scarcely sixty; and I said, in my musing hours, Shall he, who never denied me aught, or spoke to me otherwise than in love-tones, stretch forth his hands in their weakness, &quot;and find none to gird him&quot;? (241). 

===Education and the school for young ladies===
She was educated in Norwich and Hartford. With her friend Nancy Maria Hyde, Sigourney opened a school for young ladies in Norwich in 1811 The school was forced to close when Hyde became ill and was no longer able to teach. After the close of the Norwich school, she conducted a similar school in Hartford in the home of Daniel Wadsworth from 1814 until 1819. Frances Manwaring Caulkins entered the Norwich school in September 1811, and remained a very warm friend and frequent correspondent with Sigourney thereafter.

When she was quite young, one of her neighbors, the Widow Lathrop, was friendly with her and encouraged her to develop. After her friend Madam Lathrop died, Lydia was sent to visit Mrs. Jeremiah Wadsworth, an acquaintance of the Widow Lathrop in [Hartford, Connecticut]. This visit put her in contact with Daniel Wadsworth. Daniel helped her set up a school for girls, arranging for daughters of his friends to attend. 

In 1815, he also helped her publish her first work, &quot;Moral Pieces in Prose and Verse&quot;, arranging the publishing and performing the initial editing himself. Sigourney described Wadsworth as her &quot;kind patron&quot; and says that he &quot;took upon himself the whole responsibility of contracting publishers, gathering subscriptions, and even correcting the proof sheets&quot;. She goes on to say that &quot;He delighted in drawing a solitary mind from obscurity into a freer atmosphere and brighter sunbeam&quot;.

===Marriage and married life===
On June 16, 1819, she married Charles Sigourney, and after her marriage chose to write anonymously in &quot;leisure&quot; time. It was not until her parents were in dire need and her husband had lost some of his former affluence that she began to write as an occupation. When she was referred to as the probable author of the anonymous &quot;Letters to Young Ladies, By a Lady&quot; she admitted authorship and began to write openly as Mrs. Sigourney.

After her death, John Greenleaf Whittier composed a poem for her memorial tablet:
&lt;poem&gt;
:She sang alone, ere womanhood had known
::The gift of song which fills the air to-day:
:Tender and sweet, a music all her own
::May fitly linger where she knelt to pray.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Writings and criticism==

The main themes of Sigourney&#x27;s writing include death, responsibility, religion — a strong belief in God and the Christian faith — and work. She often wrote elegies or poems for recently deceased neighbors, friends, and acquaintances. Some of her work exemplifies Victorian-era death literature which views death as an escape to a better place, especially for children. There is also a strong flavor of patriotism with many poems linking to the formation of the Republic, and also a large number of poems based on a wide variety of historical subjects. She was particularly strong in her condemnation of slavery and the mistreatment of the indigenous Americans. Another aspect of her work is humor, frequently expressed in poems such as (1827) and (1834); this extends to her children&#x27;s verse, for example, (1836). A contemporary critic called her work, infused with morals, &quot;more like the dew than the lightning&quot;. 

She enjoyed substantial popularity in her lifetime and earned several nicknames, including &quot;the American Hemans&quot;, the &quot;Sweet Singer of Hartford&quot;, and the &quot;female Milton&quot;. Among other publications, she published in &quot;The Token&quot; annual gift book, which held considerable influence over American literature. Her influences included the work of Hannah More, William Wordsworth, and William Cowper.

===Conduct literature===
An advocate of gendered spheres of society, Sigourney followed the example of Hannah More in creating a gendered rhetorical theory. Sigourney wrote two conduct books. Her first, &quot;Letters to Young Ladies&quot;, was published in 1833 and was printed more than twenty-five times. This book argued that women should practice reading aloud, and also offered advice in letter writing and memorization. Sigourney promotes the importance of being agreeable throughout the book, and suggests ways to take notes, along with advice on how to paraphrase what one has read. Sigourney recommends that girls should form reading societies, and says that women should use their virtue to promote its appearance in others.

In 1835, Lydia Sigourney published &quot;Zinzendorff, and Other Poems&quot; which featured a notable poem entitled &quot;Garafilia Mohalbi&quot;. American painter and miniaturist Ann Hall 
also featured the same subject in a miniature portrait which later became a popular engraving by E. Gallaudet an engraver from Boston. A mazurka was written by Carl Gartner entitled &quot;Garafilia&quot; and a ship also bore the same name. Garafilia Mohalbi had been captured at the age of seven by the Turks during the Greek War of Independence. She was kidnapped and sold as a slave to an American Merchant Joseph Langdon. He freed her and adopted her as his daughter. Garafilia was sent to go live with his family in Boston. Three years later Mohalbi died in 1830 at the age of 13 and became the subject of an artistic movement.

Sigourney&#x27;s second conduct book, &quot;Letters to My Pupils&quot;, was published in 1837. In this book, Sigourney focuses on pronunciation and conversation, and claims that women should train in enunciation even if they are not going to be speaking publicly. According to Sigourney, women&#x27;s conversation should adhere to three rules: It should give pleasure; it should be instructive and it should be comforting. Sigourney also made a case for the value of silence at times, and argued that part of a woman&#x27;s role is to be a good listener.

In both of these books, Sigourney advocates traditional 19th century gendered spheres of society, but she also suggests that women can influence society through their teaching, conversation, and letter writing. Like Madeleine de Scudéry, Sigourney stresses the importance of being agreeable in conversation.

==Legacy==

According to &quot;Nineteenth Century Criticism&quot;, &quot;recently... there has been a renewed interest in Sigourney, particularly among feminist literary scholars. Critics such as Annie Finch, Nina Baym, and Dorothy Z. Baker have studied Sigourney&#x27;s successful attempt to establish herself as a distinctly American and distinctly female poet.&quot; Nina Baym writes about Sigourney&#x27;s construction of her own identity that through canny participation, it continued throughout her lifetime.

She was one of the most popular writers of her day, both in the United States and in England, and was called &#x27;the American Hemans.&#x27; Her writings were characterized by fluency, grace and quiet reflection on nature, domestic and religious life, and philanthropic questions; but they were also often sentimental, didactic and commonplace. Some of her blank verse and pictures of nature suggest Bryant. Among her most successful poems are &#x27;Niagara&#x27; and &#x27;Indian Names&#x27;. The latter was set to music by Natalie Merchant for the 2010 album, &quot;Leave Your Sleep&quot;. Throughout her life, she took an active interest in philanthropic and educational work (1911 Encyclopædia Britannica). Some of her most popular work deals with Native American issues and injustices. An early advocate for social reform in slavery and in internal migration, Sigourney felt obligated to use her position to help oppressed members of society. In her posthumously published autobiography, &quot;Letters of Life&quot;, Sigourney stated that she wrote with the hope of &#x27;being an instrument of good&#x27;.

Her influence was tremendous. She inspired many young women to attempt to become poets. According to Teed:As a dedicated, successful writer, Lydia Sigourney violated essential elements of the very gender roles she celebrated. In the process, she offered young, aspiring women writers around the country an example of the possibilities of achieving both fame and economic reward (19).

Rev. E. B. Huntington wrote a small consideration of Mrs. Sigourney&#x27;s life shortly after her death. He thought that her success came &quot;because with [her] gifts and [her] success, she had with singular kindliness of heart made her very life-work itself a constant source of blessing and joy to others. Her very goodness had made her great. Her genial goodwill had given her power. Her loving friendliness had made herself and her name everywhere a charm&quot; (85). She wrote to inspire others, and Huntingdon felt that she had been successful.

She contributed more than two thousand articles to many (nearly 300) periodicals (1911 Encyclopædia Britannica) and some 67 books.

In 1844, Sigourney, Iowa, the county seat of Keokuk County, Iowa, was named in her honor. A large oil-paint portrait of Lydia still graces the foyer of the county courthouse.

Her poem , from her book &quot;Poems for the Sea&quot; (1850) is repeatedly quoted in the 2019 film &quot;The Lighthouse.&quot;

===Lyceum movement===
Sigourney&#x27;s commitment to education, writing, and charity was testimony to women&#x27;s possibilities for self-betterment and, no doubt, a role model for women. When Sigourney gave up her anonymity for good, she became the most widely known &quot;authoress&quot; and &quot;poetess&quot; in America. As a result, during the lyceum movement that flourished in the United States in the 19th century, women named literary societies and study clubs in her honor, including the following examples:

* Sigourney Society (Oxford, New York) — founded at the Oxford Female Seminary, 
* Sigourney Society (Gaffney, South Carolina) — founded at Limestone Springs Female High School in 1848 — Lydia Sigourney was invited to become an honorary member; she accepted
* Sigourney Society (Griffin, Georgia) — founded at Griffin Female College, ca. 1848–1858
* Sigournian Literary Society (Pennsylvania) — founded as a society for young ladies at Glade Run Classical and Normal Academy (Glade Run Presbyterian Church) ca. 1851 — There is a Glade Run Presbyterian Church in Valencia, Pa., in Butler County, and a West Glade Run Presbyterian Church in Kittanning, Pa., in Armstrong County.

Clements finished the 2008 season with 63 combined tackles (56 solo), nine passes defensed, two interceptions, and a forced fumble in 15 games and 15 starts.

====2009====
The San Francisco 49ers&#x27; new head coach, Mike Singletary, officially named Clements the No. 1 cornerback to start the 2009 regular season, opposite Tarell Brown. He started in the San Francisco 49ers&#x27; season-opener at the Arizona Cardinals and five combined tackles, a pass deflection, and an interception in their 20–16 victory. The following week, Clements made six combined tackles and a season-high four pass deflections during a 23–10 win against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 2. On September 27, 2009, Clements recorded four combined tackles and returned a blocked field goal for a touchdown in the 49ers&#x27; 27–24 loss at the Minnesota Vikings. Clements recovered the ball and returned it for a 59-yard touchdown after it kicker Ryan Longwell&#x27;s attempt was blocked by Ray McDonald in the second quarter. He joined Kevin Ross as the only players in NFL history return a blocked field goal for a touchdown on two separate occasions. On November 1, 2009, Clements suffered a right shoulder injury in the first quarter of a Week 8 loss at the Indianapolis Colts and exited the game. He sustained the injury after he was tackled by Philip Wheeler and Jerraud Powers while returning a punt in the second quarter. Many media members called into question head coach Mike Singletary&#x27;s decision to place Clements in the punt return role due to his substantial contract and importance in the secondary. Clements took over punt return duties from Arnaz Battle who had disappointing performances after replacing recently released Pro Bowl return specialist Allen Rossum. Former head coach Mike Nolan was asked upon Clements signing about the possibility of Clements returning punt and immediately rejected the idea stating, &quot;Not even maybe.&quot; On November 3, 2009, it was reported that Clements sustained a broken right scapula to his right shoulder and was expected to miss the remainder of the season. Head coach Mike Singletary elected to not place Clements on injured reserve for the rest of the season in hopes of a possible late season or playoff return. He finished the 2009 season with 35 combined tackles (30 solo), seven passes defensed, and an interception in seven games and six starts.

====2010====
Head coach Mike Singletary retained Clements as the 49ers&#x27; No. 1 starting cornerback to start the season, alongside Shawntae Spencer.
On September 26, 2010, Clements collected a season-high nine solo tackles in the 49ers&#x27; 31–10 loss at the Kansas City Chiefs. In Week 7, he collected a season-high tying nine combined tackles and a sack in a 23–20 loss at the Carolina Panthers. On December 27, 2010, the San Francisco 49ers fired head coach Mike Singletary after the team fell to a 5–10 record. He finished the season with 82 combined tackles (72 solo), ten pass deflections, three interceptions in 16 games and 16 starts.

====2011====
On July 28, 2011, the San Francisco 49ers released Clements.

===Cincinnati Bengals===
====2011====
On July 30, 2011, the Cincinnati Bengals signed Clements to a two-year, $10.5 million contract with $6 million guaranteed and a $2 million signing bonus.

Head coach Marvin Lewis named Clements and Leon Hall the starting cornerbacks to start the 2011 regular season. In Week 9, he collected a season-high seven solo tackles during a 24–10 win at the Tennessee Titans. On December 18, 2011, Clements tied his season-high of seven solo tackles and made a sack in the Bengals&#x27; 20–13 victory at the St. Louis Rams. He finished the 2012 season with 55 combined tackles (49 solo), 12 passes defensed, two interceptions, two forced fumbles, and a sack in 15 games and 15 starts.

The Cincinnati Bengals finished third in the AFC North with a 9–7 record, but clinched a wildcard berth as the sixth seed in the NFC. On January 7, 2011, Clements started in his first career playoff game and recorded three solo tackles and a pass deflection in the Bengals&#x27; 31–10 loss at the Houston Texans in the AFC Wildcard Game.

====2012====
Clements entered training camp slated as a starting cornerback, but saw competition from Terence Newman, Jason Allen, Adam &quot;Pacman&quot; Jones, and Dre Kirkpatrick. Clements was one of six cornerbacks on the Bengals&#x27; roster that were once heralded first round picks. Head coach Marvin Lewis officially named Clements and Hall the starting cornerbacks to begin 2012.

On September 23, 2012, Clements recorded a season-high ten combined tackles (five solo) during the Bengals&#x27; 38–31 win at the Washington Redskins. Clements was inactive for the Bengals&#x27; Week 4 victory at the Jacksonville Jaguars due to an injury. Upon returning, Clements began to transition to strong safety after losing his starting cornerback job to Terence Newman during his absence. He started five of the next six games before losing the role back to Chris Crocker. He finished the season with 53 combined tackles (31 solo), five pass deflections, and an interception in 15 games and nine starts.
