<text>Racing Club de Strasbourg Alsace, commonly known as RC Strasbourg (, ; RCS) or simply just Racing, is a French professional association football club founded in 1906 and based in the city of Strasbourg, Alsace. Its became a professional club in 1933. It is currently playing in Ligue 1, the top tier of French football, since winning the 2016–17 Ligue 2 championship. This comes after the club was demoted to the fifth tier of French football at the conclusion of the 2010–11 Championnat National season after going into financial liquidation. Renamed RC Strasbourg Alsace, they won the CFA championship in 2012–13, and became Championnat National champions in 2015–16. Stade de la Meinau has been the club&#x27;s stadium since 1914.

RC Strasbourg is one of six clubs to have won all three major French trophies: the Championship in 1979; the Coupe de France in 1951, 1966 and 2001; and the Coupe de la Ligue in 1964, 1997, 2005 and 2019. It is also among the six teams to have played more than 2,000 games in France&#x27;s top flight (spanning 56 seasons) and has taken part in 52 European games since 1961. By contrast, it has also experienced relegation at least once a decade since the early 1950s. It has changed its manager 52 times in 75 years of professional play.

The destiny of the RC Strasbourg has always been wedded to the history of Alsace. Like the region, the club has changed nationality three times and has a troubled history. Founded in what was then a part of the German Empire, the club from the beginning insisted on its Alsatian and popular roots, in opposition to the first Strasbourg-based clubs which came from the German-born bourgeoisie. When Alsace was returned to France in 1919, the club changed its name from &quot;1. FC Neudorf&quot; to the current &quot;Racing Club de Strasbourg&quot;, in imitation of Pierre de Coubertin&#x27;s Racing Club de France, a clear gesture of francophilia. RC Strasbourg players lived through World War II as most Alsatians did: evacuated in 1939, annexed in 1940 and striving to avoid nazification and incorporation in the Wehrmacht between 1942 and 1944. When Alsace was definitively returned to France, Strasbourg&#x27;s identity switched towards Jacobinism with, for example, emotional wins in the cup in 1951 and 1966 amidst Franco-Alsatian controversies.

==History==
Founded in 1906 as &quot;Fußballclub Neudorf&quot;, Racing Club de Strasbourg Alsace&#x27;s history has been marked by constant periods of instability, firstly due to political issues (for the first forty years of its existence, the club played alternately in the French and German championships because of the dispute between the two countries over Alsace), and secondly due to corporate issues. In spite of this, the team was able to carve out a place for itself in the golden roll of the French league by winning a number of trophies, the most important of which was the championship in the 1978-79 season.

=== &quot;Fußballclub Neudorf&quot; ===

In the early 1900s, the English export of soccer to foreign countries also reached the deepest parts of the German Empire (which had already established a national league called the &quot;Verbandsliga&quot; in 1902), including the &quot;Reichsland&quot; Alsace-Lorraine. One of the cities most involved in this process was the capital city of Strasbourg (which already had a football club called &quot;Straßburger Fußball Club&quot; since 1890), where several football clubs saw the light of day, including &quot;Fußballclub Neudorf&quot;, founded by a group of students from the Neudorf district, located south of the city. The team, which was financially supported by the students&#x27; teacher, made its debut in a match against &quot;FC Germania&quot; from the Schluthfeld district, in which it withdrew after conceding seven goals in the first forty-five minutes of play.

Over the next three years, the team, renamed &quot;Fußballclub Cäsar Neudorf&quot; and given a corporate organizational chart to cope with the inexperience of the players, continued to produce unconvincing results, attracting criticism and threatening to split several times. Thanks to the arrival of Louis Becker as president, in 1909 Neudorf was able to gain membership in the &quot;Verband Süddeutscher Fußball-Vereine&quot;, the football association in the southern part of the German Empire, which was part of the third tier of German football. Neudorf began a gradual improvement in results: thanks to a highly offensive style of play, the team achieved large victories (including a 28-0 victory over Erstein, the second largest margin of victory in the history of German football), which led to a double promotion within two years. In 1914, a few weeks before promotion to the first division, Neudorf acquired its first playing field, the &quot;Hämmerlé&#x27;s Garten&quot;, on which the Meinau Stadium was built. In the same year, all sports activities were interrupted due to the outbreak of the First World War.

=== The debut in French soccer ===

With the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine to France at the end of the war, it was decided to change the name of the club, which, in homage to Racing Club de France, became &quot;Racing Club de Strasbourg&quot;. In the decade following the end of hostilities, Strasbourg played in the Alsace regional championship (winning it in 1923, 1924 and 1927) and, from the 1920-21 season, in the French Cup. In the latter competition, the team never made it past the round of 16, but in the 1925-26 season, it pulled off an upset by eliminating Red Star, a team that at the time held the record for most national cups won. It was also during this period that the first wooden stands were built on the field, which later became the Meinau Stadium.

In 1932, Strasbourg&#x27;s management rejected a proposal to turn the team professional that had just been approved by the Football Federation. Attempts to change management&#x27;s decision (including a proposal to merge with Strasbourg Red Star) yielded a positive result a year later when, after a vote of 126 for, 2 against and 2 abstentions, the team was finally allowed to become professional and debut in the second division.

After winning the playoffs against rivals Mulhouse and Saint-Étienne, the Alsatians battled with Sochaux for the title in their debut in the top flight. Initially, Strasbourg had the upper hand, finishing first in the first half of the season, but lost the head-to-head match on the road to Sochaux, who went on to win the title despite losing the final match. In the following championships, the team, boosted by German striker Oskar Rohr, confirmed its status as a mid-table team, while in the 1936-37 French Cup, Strasbourg reached the final: again, Sochaux prevailed, winning 2-1 in a comeback.

=== Re-annexation to the German Reich ===

At the beginning of World War II, with the occupation of France by the Third Reich army, the team was reconstituted as an amateur club by some players who had fled to the south of the country. After winning the regional championship, the team was introduced into the German football system, taking the name &quot;Rasensportclub Straßburg&quot; and playing in the &quot;Gauliga Elsaß&quot;.

From then until the liberation of Alsace, Strasbourg would play in four editions of the &quot;Gauliga&quot;, finishing second three times in a row (losing the title to Mulhouse in a playoff in the first year) and participating in the 1941-42 edition of the German Cup, where they were eliminated by Mulhouse in the first round. Notable during this period was the heated rivalry with &quot;Red Star Strasbourg&quot;, renamed &quot;SS Strasbourg&quot; after their affiliation with the regime&#x27;s political police.

=== The postwar period ===
At the end of hostilities, with the return of Alsace to the political control of France, Strasbourg was reintegrated into the same football system in which it had participated before the outbreak of the war. After finishing twelfth in the league at the end of the war, Strasbourg came close to a double in the 1946-47 season, finishing among the contenders for the championship and competing for the French Cup until the final, where they were defeated by Lille.

In the following seasons, Strasbourg went through a period of mixed results: in the 1948-49 championship, the team, relegated on the field, avoided relegation thanks to Colmar&#x27;s abandonment of its professional status. Two seasons later, the team won its first official trophy by winning the 1950-51 edition of the French Cup: this was possible thanks to a victory in the final against Valenciennes, which sparked celebrations throughout Alsace, culminating in the team being welcomed by 50,000 fans.

Winning this trophy did not bring stability to the team&#x27;s results, as they dropped to the second division three times during the 1950s (1952, 1957, and 1960), only to return to the top flight immediately afterwards. The only notable result of the decade came in the 1954-55 season, when Strasbourg, led by Ernst Stojaspal, contended for the top spots in the standings, finishing fourth overall, and were eliminated by Lille in the French Cup semifinals.

=== The debut in Europe ===
In the early 1960s, Strasbourg had the chance to make their debut on the European stage, playing in the 1961-62 edition of the Fairs Cup, where they were eliminated in the first round by MTK Hungária. Thanks to subsidies from the municipality, Strasbourg experienced a period of improved results, culminating in the 1964-65 season, during which the team fought for the title: in second place, one point behind Nantes with four games to play, the Alsatians drew the head-to-head match and then succumbed in the final, finishing fifth. In the same season, the team had an excellent performance in the Fairs Cup, reaching the quarterfinals (after eliminating the likes of AC Milan and Barcelona, the latter equalizing in the dying seconds of the second leg and being eliminated after a 0-0 draw in the replay), where they were eliminated by Manchester United, who had already guaranteed qualification to the semifinals from the first leg (thanks to a 5-0 away win).

The following season, Strasbourg reached the final of the French Cup for the fourth time in the club&#x27;s history, defeating Toulouse after equalizing with a minute remaining and then winning in extra time. In the final, the Alsatians faced newly crowned French champions Nantes, whom they defeated 1-0. In the same season, Strasbourg also participated in the Fairs Cup, where they met AC Milan in the first round. After losing 1-0 at the San Siro, the Alsatians won the return leg 2-1, forcing a play-off, which Milan won on a draw after the match ended 1-1.

In the following seasons, Strasbourg&#x27;s results in competitions were unremarkable (except for a fifth-place finish in the 1969-70 season), so much so that the club&#x27;s management decided to merge the club with the amateur team &quot;Pierrots Vauban&quot;, renaming it &quot;Racing Pierrots Strasbourg Meinau&quot;. However, the results were unsatisfactory: in the first season under the new name (1970-71), the team was relegated to Division 2, only to return to the top flight the following year. A second relegation in the 1975-76 season led to a split in the club with the re-founding of &quot;Pierrots Vauban&quot; and the restoration of the &quot;Racing Club de Strasbourg&quot; name.

=== Championship title ===
After regaining promotion by winning the second division after a playoff with the top team in Group A (Monaco), Strasbourg started the 1977-78 season with a virtually unchanged lineup from the previous year, with the addition of Jacques Novi, Francis Piasecki (both from Paris Saint-Germain), and Raymond Domenech. Gilbert Gress, a former Strasbourg center forward in the 1960s who would become the most representative coach in the club&#x27;s history, was also brought in to lead the team. Under Gress, the team adopted a tactic based on collective play, based on the 4-3-3 formation, which included the use of Gemmrich, Tanter and Vergnes as attackers. After a slow start, Strasbourg gradually regained positions and placed themselves among the contenders for a place in the UEFA zone, which then consisted of only two teams. A late collapse by Olympique Marseille allowed the Alsatians to move into third place with three days to go: a 3-2 win at Laval on the final day secured them the final spot to qualify for their third European competition.

Riding the wave of this success, Strasbourg prepared for the next season without making too many changes to the squad, only buying Roger Jouve from Nice and replacing Vergnes with the younger Wagner. The team started the championship in better form than the previous year, taking the lead on the fifth day and maintaining it throughout the season, although a defeat against Saint-Étienne in the return leg had favored the &quot;Verts&quot;&#x27; approach. A brace by Wagner and a goal by Ehrlacher in the final match against Lyon (on June 1, 1979) sparked celebrations throughout Alsace, which culminated the following day when the team was welcomed by 200,000 fans at Strasbourg station.

=== The decline ===
Immediately after winning the national title, the team&#x27;s leadership was taken over by the politician André Bord, repeatedly elected Secretary of State for the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry for Veterans in the governments installed between 1966 and 1978 and former president of the team&#x27;s multisport section. The new president almost immediately came into conflict with Gress by organizing a transfer window that brought to Strasbourg outstanding players such as the national player François Bracci and the top scorer Carlos Bianchi, who, however, did not meet the tactical requirements of the coach. This climate of conflict at the top of the club, known as the &quot;Affaire Gress-Bord&quot;, also affected the performance of the team, which, with a center forward incompatible with Gress&#x27;s tactics based on the collective, failed to defend the title and, as compensation, reached the quarterfinals of the European Cup, where they were eliminated by Ajax.

The tensions between Gress and Bord reached a climax at the beginning of the 1980-81 season: after a very bad start in the championship, the fans, siding with Gress, began to harshly challenge the club, demanding the resignation of Bord, who, supported also by prominent politicians such as Jacques Chirac, remained at the helm of the club and fired the coach. This event marked the end of Strasbourg&#x27;s golden era, which saw the loss of almost all the players who had contributed to the 1979 championship within a few years, replaced by important names (Didier Six, Jean-François Larios, Éric Pécout and Olivier Rouyer) who were never able to live up to expectations. This was also reflected in the team&#x27;s results, which stagnated in the lower mid-table positions during the first half of the 1980s until the 1985-86 season, which ended with Strasbourg&#x27;s relegation to Division 2 and the resignation of Bord, who left Daniel Hechter a team in the midst of corporate chaos, which remained entangled in the lower parts of the second division and then finished in ninth place. The team&#x27;s new president, formerly the leading man of Paris Saint-Germain in the 1970s, had plans to rebuild a winning team, but his ambitions clashed with a disastrous economic situation that reached such a level in 1990 (a debt of 90 million francs was discovered) that he was forced to resign under pressure from the city&#x27;s mayor.

=== The return to Europe ===

The team, which had reached the top flight the previous two years only to drop back to the second division, was entrusted to industrialist Jacky Kientz. Failure to win promotion in the 1990-91 season prompted the management to recall Gress to the bench: relying on young prospects such as Frank Leboeuf and Martin Djetou, the coach led the team back to Division 1 after a close battle with Bordeaux and a 4-0 victory over Stade Rennais in the promotion/relegation playoff. Back in the top flight, Strasbourg made their debut by finishing close to the UEFA qualification spots. At the end of the following season, in which the team avoided relegation, there was a change at the top of the club, with Roland Weller taking over as president. Despite offers to extend his contract, Gress, who had come into conflict with some players during the championship over his training methods, decided to leave the team, causing discontent among the fans.

Such events did not initially destabilize the team&#x27;s performance, which, entrusted to former player Daniel Jeandupeux, was in third place at the beginning of the 1994-95 season. A decline over the winter favored the replacement of Jeandupeux with former player Jacky Duguépéroux, who led the team to the French Cup final (lost 1-0 to Paris Saint-Germain) and tenth place in the league, which qualified the team for the newly created Intertoto Cup. By winning the competition, Strasbourg gained access to the UEFA Cup, returning to the European stage after a sixteen-year absence: their progress in the competition was interrupted by AC Milan in the round of 16. In the following two seasons, despite the departures of key players compensated by the introduction of youth players into the first team (including Olivier Dacourt, who made his debut as a striker), the team continued to achieve results that helped them qualify for European competitions, This culminated in the 1996-97 season, when the team finished ninth in the league after spending much of the season in mid-table positions, but qualified directly for the UEFA Cup thanks to winning the League Cup, which they did after narrowly defeating Bordeaux in the final.

That season also saw another change at the top of the club, which was taken over on March 21, 1997 by the IMG group, headed by former tennis player Patrick Proisy: the new ownership sparked a wave of optimism among the team&#x27;s supporters, but they played a championship far below expectations and struggled to avoid relegation until the last day. The same season will also be remembered for the team&#x27;s journey in the UEFA Cup: after eliminating Rangers, Strasbourg faced Liverpool in the second round, winning 3-0 at home to effectively secure qualification, as the 2-0 defeat at Anfield did not affect the aggregate score. The Alsatians&#x27; adventure came to an end in the third round against Inter Milan, who bounced back from a first-leg defeat.

The departure of Duguépéroux, who was in conflict with the management, opened a new dark period for the team, which had some bad seasons with unimpressive results both in the league and in the national cups. The worst moment seemed to materialize in the 2000-01 season, at the end of which the team was relegated to Division 2, having finished last without ever being able to fight to avoid relegation. However, the negative result was compensated by winning the third French Cup, which came after defeating Amiens in the final: the match, which ended 0-0 after extra time, was decided by penalty kicks, with the Alsatians winning 5-4. Thanks to this result, Strasbourg, who had been coached by Ivan Hašek during the summer, qualified for the UEFA Cup, from which they were eliminated in the first round by Standard Liège. This allowed the team to focus on the league, where they made a comeback to finish second and return to the newly formed Ligue 1.

=== Management changes, crisis and decline ===

The 2002-2003 season, which ended with the team avoiding relegation, saw a change in the club&#x27;s top management, which had already been shaken by legal vicissitudes regarding the use of the club&#x27;s name: the IMG group was replaced by a group of entrepreneurs led by German businessman Egon Gindorf. With the legal problems resolved, Strasbourg (with Antoine Kombouaré and Jacky Duguépéroux on the bench) battled through two mid-table seasons, culminating in the 2004-05 season with victory in the second League Cup against Caen (2-1). After qualifying for the UEFA Cup again, Strasbourg seemed to be on their way to a second golden period, but Philippe Ginestet&#x27;s ascension to the club&#x27;s presidency caused dissension in the management, which also affected the team&#x27;s performance in the 2005-06 season, which ended in early relegation, with the first win not coming until the third-last day of the first half of the season. This negative result was offset by Strasbourg&#x27;s performance in the UEFA Cup, where they were eliminated by Roma in the round of 16.

After winning promotion to Ligue 1 at the end of the 2006-07 season thanks to Jean-Pierre Papin (who knew how to get the most out of a team made up of players from lower leagues), Strasbourg started the 2007-08 season with Jean-Marc Furlan on the bench. The team seemed to be struggling on a par with the other relegation contenders, navigating mid-table positions until midway through the season, but from March onward, they suffered a steep decline that saw them drop positions until they finished second-last. In this context, a 2-1 defeat against Lyon, thanks to a goal scored by Fabio Grosso, who was heavily insulted by Furlan at the end of the game, is noteworthy; despite the controversy and the result, the club confirmed Furlan at the helm of the team that failed to gain promotion to Ligue 1 in the 2008-09 season, losing to Boulogne on the final day of the season.

At the end of the season, there was a reshuffle at the top of the club, bringing in former player Léonard Specht who, after trying to sign Gernot Rohr, hired Gress, who then returned to lead the team for the third time. However, the beginning of the 2009-10 season was marked by a confusing situation at the top of the club, with Gress (opposed by Ginestet who remained in the company as majority shareholder) being replaced after two defeats in the first two matches. Due to this result, Spécht also resigned, which favored the return of Ginestet as president, who called Pascal Janin, formerly Gress&#x27;s assistant, to the bench. In November 2009, negotiations began for the transfer of Strasbourg&#x27;s ownership to the English company FC Football Capital Limited, which took control of the club on December 5 with Julien Fournier as president. The vicissitudes at the corporate level were reflected in the team&#x27;s results: six points clear of the relegation zone with six days to go, Strasbourg collapsed with only two points, and were overtaken by the other relegation contenders on the final day, dropping to the third division.

At the end of the 2010-2011 Third Division season, Strasbourg finished fourth and missed out on promotion to Ligue 2, but failed and restarted from the fifth division, the Championnat de France Amateur 2 Group C.

=== Promotion from the fifth division to Ligue 1 ===

In 2011-2012, the team immediately returned to the Championnat de France Amateur, the fourth division, winning Group C of the Championnat de France Amateur 2 with 100 points. In 2012, the team changed its name to &quot;Racing Club de Strasbourg Alsace&quot; and also changed its logo. After winning the fourth division championship in 2012-2013, the club returned to the Championnat National, the third division, within two years. For the 2014-2015 season, Jacky Duguépéroux took over after François Keller had managed the club for three years. In 2015-2016, Strasbourg won the National and returned to Ligue 2 after six years. In 2016-2017, they completed the climb, winning the second division as a newly promoted team and landing in the top flight. In Ligue 1 in 2017-18, the team finished in 15th place, saving themselves on the penultimate day thanks to a win at Décines-Charpieu against Olympique Lyonnais in a comeback with a free kick goal by Dimitri Liénard in the final minutes. In 2018-2019, the team won the French League Cup for the third time, defeating Guingamp 4-1 on penalties in the final.

==Colours and crest==

While the colours of the town are red and white, Racing has always played in a combination of blue and white. The exact origin of this choice of colours is unknown. Over the years, the most common uniform has been composed of a medium blue jersey, white shorts and medium blue socks. During the last ten years, however, the team has regularly switched between medium blue, dark blue, sky blue and white as the main colour of its home jersey. Since 2007, the Flag of Alsace is featured on the back of the club&#x27;s shirt. Hummel is the current kit designer. Previously (1973–2000; 2004–2007), Racing was equipped by Adidas, which has its French seat in Landersheim, between Strasbourg and Saverne. ASICS also supplied the club (2000–03).

The current team crest has been in use – with interruptions – since 1976 and is generally considered as the most legitimate one. It includes a stylised stork (symbol of Alsace), a red diagonal stripe from the city&#x27;s coat of arms and a depiction of the Cathedral along with the club&#x27;s initials: RCS. Between 1997 and 2006, the club used another logo, introduced by Patrick Proisy. This crest was then considered to be more &quot;modern&quot; and was supposed to depict at the same time the cathedral and a stork. The resemblance, however, was far from being obvious to everyone and the design was quickly derogatively nicknamed &quot;Pac-Man&quot; due to some common traits with the famous video game. In 2006, the new management of the club, acceding to a supporter demand, re-installed the 1976 crest.

==Stadium==
Racing have been playing at the Stade de la Meinau in southern Strasbourg since 1914. The stadium hosted the 1938 World Cup and Euro 1984. Its maximum capacity was downsized from 45,000 to 29,000 during the 1990s to meet new safety standards.

==Supporters and rivalries==
Historically, Racing has its roots in southern Strasbourg in the working-class Neudorf, Meinau and Polygone neighbourhoods. In the 1930s, the team was the only one in the area to jump to professional play and, with the help of good results during that decade, it built support all around the town. In Strasbourg like in the rest of France, there is only one pro football club in every city and hence no in-town rivalry, a fact that heavily contrasts with the situation in Great Britain, Italy or Spain. Nowadays, as the only professional football club in Alsace, Racing attracts a large fan base that covers both the Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin départements as well as the eastern part of the Moselle. The fan-base outside of this area is essentially limited to people that, for a reason or another, have a personal link with Alsace. The club also has ties to the other side of the Rhine, especially through a supporter friendship with Karlsruher SC and regular friendly matches during the summer.

On average, the attendance in Ligue 1 has been around 20,000 for a stadium capacity of 29,000. Supporters groups include the &quot;Ultra Boys 90&quot;, the &quot;Kop Ciel et Blanc&quot; and the &quot;Club central des supporters&quot;. Most of the supporter groups and the most vocal fans in general have elected location in the Kop at the &quot;Quart de Virage Nord-Ouest&quot; (North-West quarter corner). Strasbourg supporters have the reputation to be faithful yet critical. Former captain Corentin Martins has once asserted that the Strasbourg public is &quot;demanding, but fair&quot;. Racing is always an emotional topic in Alsace. It is often said that some may love it or hate it, or even both at the same time, but that it leaves no one indifferent.

Racing Strasbourg&#x27;s main rival is Metz. The clubs compete is what is generally referred as the &quot;Derby de l&#x27;Est&quot; (&quot;the Eastern derby&quot;) in France, a rather inappropriate term since the two cities are 150 kilometres apart. There is however a significant degree of inter-regional rivalry between Alsace and Lorraine, leading to some acrimony between the fans on both sides. The two clubs met each other in the quarter-finals of the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup in what was the first ever match between two French teams in a European competition. Strasbourg won the game 2–0. When Mulhouse was professional, the two sides also nourished a rivalry that persists as far as youth teams are concerned.

==Ownership and chairmanship==

===Overview===
Racing&#x27;s history has always been closely intertwined with local business and politics. In the 1930s, the club&#x27;s jump to professionalism was sustained by car manufacturer Emile Mathis who had his factory just in front of the stade de la Meinau. RCS quickly entered a rivalry with Sochaux, a team that was backed by Mathis&#x27; competitor Peugeot. After WW2, Mathis ceased activity and the club had to find other sponsors including the Crédit Mutuel – a large banking institution that has its roots in Alsace and appeared on the club&#x27;s shirt throughout most of the 1960s and 1970s – as well as the town&#x27;s municipality. In 1980, André Bord, a prominent local Gaullist politician and former minister during the Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou presidencies, became chairman. Bord could boast his connections in business, political and artistic elites and vowed to make Racing a big name in French football. However, he quickly entered a confrontation with charismatic manager Gilbert Gress that culminated in September 1980 when the announcement of Gress&#x27; departure provoked crowd anger and riots scenes during a game against Nantes. The inability for the influential president and the talented manager to get along with each other and the 1980 trauma may explain why Racing was unable to perform lastingly at the top level after the 1979 title.

In 1986, Bord left the professional section and introduced fashion designer Daniel Hechter as his successor. Hechter had previously been banned from pro football following his involvement in the Paris Saint-Germain secret funds scandal but was nevertheless able to re-take a president job at Strasbourg thanks to a sentence reduction. It was the first attempt to bring an outsider to the local context at the club&#x27;s head, but the experiment ended in failure in 1990 as the club neared bankruptcy. Racing was at that time salvaged by the Strasbourg municipality which took a 49% share of the club but had to relinquish it a few years later as the Pasqua legislation restricted public support to professional sport. In 1997, two projects were competing to buy the municipal share and effectively take control of the club. The first was led by then-president Roland Weller, a local businessman. The second bid was made by American IMG-McCormack Group through its French branch headed by Patrick Proisy. At that time, IMG was trying to develop its activities in European football and had failed the previous year in its effort to buy Marseille. The American group presented an ambitious project with an entirely new youth academy as well as plans for a renovated stadium, eventually winning the competition for Racing&#x27;s ownership for a price of 1.5 million euros. The club became a &quot;Société Anonyme à Objet Sportif&quot; and then a &quot;Société Anonyme Sportive Professionnelle&quot;, a status very similar to the general corporate status, albeit with restrictions like the impossibility to enter the stock market and the obligation to keep ties with the original association. Proisy became the chairman of the board with full control over the professional section but not the omni-sport structure that still possessed the club&#x27;s name and its affiliation to the French Football Federation (FFF). This was evidenced in 2002 when Proisy and Bord, still a chairman of the omni-sport, entered a dispute that led to the inability for the pro players to wear the name &quot;Racing club de Strasbourg&quot; on their jerseys for some time.

Proisy&#x27;s reign at Strasbourg was fraught with misunderstandings, frustration and poor results on the pitch. The Alsatian public especially resented Proisy&#x27;s unwillingness to settle in Strasbourg, instead controlling the club&#x27;s destiny from IMG&#x27;s offices in Paris. Racing&#x27;s troubles as well as the town&#x27;s refusal to finance an extension of the stade de la Meinau to host the 1998 FIFA World Cup provoked heated debate during the 2001 municipal election and eventually became part of the elements that drove to the defeat of Catherine Trautmann. In 2003, the club was bought back by a pool of local investors including Egon Gindorf, who became chairman, Patrick Adler, Pierre Schmidt and Philippe Ginestet, who all had been club sponsors during the IMG era. The new ownership bought the club for a symbolical euro to an IMG group eager to cut its losses after the death of Mark McCormack but had to cover a 3 million euro deficit to close the 2002–03 budget. It is estimated that Racing lost 15 million euros during the IMG era, mainly due to a dubious recruitment policy.

Thanks to a prudent transfer policy initiated by director Marc Keller and good attendance rates, the new management was able to redress finances but the club&#x27;s economic situation has remained fragile up to now. In 2004, Gindorf experienced personal and financial difficulties and was willing to scale down his involvement at Racing. It was understood that Philippe Ginestet would become the new chairman at the end of the 2004–05 season. However, this move was opposed by Keller who, in June 2005, clearly announced that he would not work with Ginestet. Keller had in fact been acting as the club&#x27;s head since 2002 but was only a minor shareholder. He nevertheless was able to mobilise his iconic status with supporters to, at first, block Ginestet&#x27;s accession to chairmanship, provoking a deadlock that lasted throughout 2005 as the club was looking for an investor. In the fall of 2005, it was announced that Alain Afflelou, owner of the biggest optician in France and a former president of Bordeaux, would be the new owner, but he was eventually out-bid by Ginestet, who took control of the club midway through the 2005–06 season, forcing Keller&#x27;s departure a few months later. Ginestet held a majority share during four years, which he sold in the end of 2009 for a price of €1.6 million. After some speculation, the new owner was identified as Alain Fontenla, a French investment broker based in London. In 2010, Fontenla owned 85%, along with Carousel Finance (15%) a holding named &quot;Racing investissements&quot;, which itself owned a majority share (70%) of EuroRacing, the main shareholder (78%) of the club. The other major shareholder of the club was Lohr SA, an industrial group centred on transportation activities.

On 22 June 2023, BlueCo, the consortium which purchased Premier League club Chelsea in May 2022, acquired a majority stake in the club.

===Presidential history===
Below is a list of Strasbourg&#x27;s 15 presidents since the start of the professional era in 1933. The president has not always been the real owner of the club. For example, between 1990 and 1997, the municipality was the major shareholder, but it chose to delegate the chairmanships to independent local entrepreneurs.

The 2009–10 season saw a record of five successive presidents. Early into the season, Léonard Specht stepped down from his position, after the sacking of Glibert Gress, whom he had appointed as manager. Philippe Ginestet then re-took the presidency, but left the club when the takeover by the new owners was completed in December. The new owners chose to name Julien Fournier as the new Chief executive but, after some turmoil, Fournier quickly entered a dispute with the new major shareholder, Alain Fontenla. Fournier&#x27;s contract was terminated in February and he was replaced by Luc Dayan on an interim basis. Only a month later, former Sochaux chairman Jean-Claude Plessis came to replace Dayan.

===Former players===
RCS does not have an official hall of fame or an all-time XI. Various selections have been made by press and supporters but none has achieved universal respect. 21 players have been capped for France while playing for Strasbourg. The most notable one is Oscar Heisserer who played a record 18 times with the national team while at Strasbourg and was the first Alsatian and first and only RCS player to wear the armband for France. Dominique Dropsy, Léonard Specht and Gérard Hausser also earned more than 10 caps while Marc Molitor is one of the rare examples of a player being capped for the national team while playing in the Division 2. Unsurprisingly, it is during the 1978–1979 title season that Racing had the most players included in the national squad. On 7 October 1978 were a record four RCS players (Dominique Dropsy, Roger Jouve, Francis Piasecki, Albert Gemmrich) on the field for a Euro 1980 qualifying game against Luxembourg. This figure was repeated a month later for a friendly against Spain (Dropsy, Piasecki, Gemmrich and Léonard Specht). Frank Leboeuf and Marc Keller were the last RCS players to earn a cap during the 1995–1996 season. Leboeuf is one of the two former RCS in the French team that won World Cup, the other one being Youri Djorkaeff.
Players to have once played for Strasbourg to have recently played for France include Olivier Dacourt and Richard Dutruel, (both in 2004). Furthermore, current France international midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin is a product of RC Strasbourg&#x27;s Youth set-up, spending 14 years with the club before moving to Southampton after just five first-team appearances for Strasbourg. Schneiderlin then moved to Manchester United on 14 July 2015 before a move to Everton in January 2017.

With regional feelings still strong in Alsace, the performances of local players logically attract special attention. Seven out of the ten players with the most appearances for Racing are from Alsace: René Hauss (who holds the record), Léonard Specht, René Deutschmann, Edmond Haan, Gérard Hausser, Jean Schuth and Raymond Kaelbel. Since 1979, there is also a peculiar tradition that every Racing team to win a trophy or reach a final featured a Breton as captain, manager or both. Jacky Duguépéroux captained the 1979 team and won the Coupe de la Ligue in 1997 and 2005 as a manager. The 2001 Coupe de France winning team for itself included Yvon Pouliquen as manager and Corentin Martins as captain. Pouliquen also was the captain for the 1995 final.
Apart from French internationals and Alsatians, there is a strong tradition to have foreign players from Central and Eastern Europe at Strasbourg. The successful Racing team of the 1930s regularly included Austrians both as players and coaches, a tradition that was continued when Ernst Stojaspal played at la Meinau in the 1950s. Other &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; players fondly remembered include Elek Schwartz, Ivica Osim, Ivan Hašek, Alexander Vencel or Danijel Ljuboja while Russian Aleksandr Mostovoi is the last world-class star to play for Racing to this date. Also, one of the greatest goalkeepers of all times, the Paraguayan José Luis Chilavert who, known for being three times selected IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper and his free-kick abilities, won the 2001 Coupe de France with the club.

==Managers==

Strasbourg has had 47 managers in the professional era, with the holder of the office changing 57 times. This is a record in French football only surpassed by Marseille. Gilbert Gress holds the record for the longest-serving manager at the club, both for a single spell (39 months between. 1977–80, 152 matches) and overall (75 months in three spells, 275 matches). Paul Frantz holds the record for the most spells at Racing with four (73 months overall, 227 matches). Jacky Duguépéroux is the only manager to win two trophies with the club.

<text>José Alberto de Oliveira Anchieta (variations José d&#x27;Anchieta, José Anchieta, José de Anchieta - b. October 9, 1832 in Lisbon, Kingdom of Portugal, d. September 14, 1897 in Caconda, Portuguese Angola) was a 19th-century Portuguese explorer and naturalist who, between 1866 and 1897, travelled extensively in Portuguese Angola, Africa, collecting animals and plants. His specimens from Angola and Mozambique were sent out to Portugal, where they were later examined by several zoologists and botanists, chiefly among them J.V. Barboza du Bocage.

==Life==
Anchieta was born in 1832, in Lisbon, and started his studies in mathematics at the University of Coimbra. Due to his fierce independence and eccentric character, however, he did not adapt well and moved to the Escola Politécnica de Lisboa (Polytechnic School of Lisbon). In 1857, one of his closest friends moved to Portuguese Cape Verde, a Portuguese colony and a group of islands in the Atlantic Ocean in West Africa, and Anchieta went to join him. He spent his time studying the local flora and fauna in the island of Santo Antão, and finally ended up helping the local inhabitants as an amateur physician (he had studied some medicine). A cholera epidemic killed most of the inhabitants and he almost died too, but he was able to return to Portugal after two years. Following what he thought was his vocation, he studied medicine in Lisbon, London and Paris, but could not complete the course, and returned to Africa again, this time to Angola, one of the largest West African Portuguese colonies. He was successful as an explorer of the hinterland and as a naturalist, and after studying and collecting many new animal and plant species, he returned to Portugal. Most of his collections were lost when his canoe foundered in a river, but he donated what remained to the natural history museum of the Polytechnic School.

In 1865, he travelled back on his own once again to Angola. This time, he was married and his wife accompanied him. He stayed on his own in the region of Benguela, establishing a laboratory inside the ruins of a church, and exploring and collecting animals, until, in 1867, the Portuguese government hired him, ostensibly as a naturalist. But what is most probable is that Anchieta was recruited as a secret agent and informer in the Caconda region of Angola, one of the most extreme points of its territory. He stayed there, researching, exploring and sending many specimens and letters to his scientific correspondents in Lisbon. He also helped medically in the local hospital and was much appreciated by the population as a dedicated and humane care-giving person.

Little is known in the manner of documentation about this period of Anchieta&#x27;s life, because most of the museum specimens disappeared, as well as his many letters to Bocage, in a catastrophic fire in the museum, in 1978.

Anchieta died while returning from a zoological expedition to Caconda, in 1897, at 66 years of age, probably of the chronic consequences of malaria, which he and his wife caught, and which had severely undermined his health for many years.

In all, according to Bocage, Anchieta&#x27;s zoological output was truly prolific. He was responsible for identifying 25 new species of mammals, 46 birds, and 46 amphibians and reptiles. He didn&#x27;t care much for writing scientific papers, though, but left this to his correspondents in Lisbon.

Many of the species of birds, amphibians, lizards, snakes, fishes and mammals collected by him were unknown and thus were named for Anchieta with the species designation &quot;anchietae&quot;. Some of them were:
* Anchieta&#x27;s sunbird (&quot;Anthreptes anchietae&quot;), a bird
* Anchieta&#x27;s barbet (&quot;Stactolaema anchietae&quot;), a bird
* Anchieta&#x27;s tchagra (&quot;Tchagra anchietae&quot;), a bird
* Anchieta&#x27;s ridged frog (&quot;Ptychadena anchietae&quot;)
* Anchieta&#x27;s dune lizard (&quot;Meroles anchietae&quot;)
* Anchieta&#x27;s frog (&quot;Hylambates anchietae&quot;)
* Anchieta&#x27;s tree frog (&quot;Leptopelis anchietae&quot;)
* Anchieta&#x27;s chameleon (&quot;Chamaeleo anchietae&quot;), a lizard
* Anchieta&#x27;s cobra (&quot;Naja anchietae&quot;), a venomous snake
* Anchieta&#x27;s dwarf python (&quot;Python anchietae&quot;), a non-venomous snake
* Anchieta&#x27;s pipistrelle (&quot;Pipistrellus anchietai&quot;), a bat
* Anchieta&#x27;s elephantfish (&quot;Mormyrus anchietae&quot;)
* Anchieta&#x27;s antelope (&quot;Cephalophus anchietae&quot;)
* Anchieta&#x27;s serpentiform skink (&quot;Eumecia anchietae&quot;), a lizard
* Anchieta&#x27;s spade-snouted worm lizard (&quot;Monopeltis anchietae&quot;), an amphisbaenian
* Anchieta&#x27;s agama (&quot;Agama anchietae&quot;), a lizard

<text>Toulouse Football Club () is a French professional football club based in Toulouse. The club was founded in 1970 and currently plays in Ligue 1, the first division of French football. Toulouse plays its home matches at the Stadium de Toulouse located within the city.

&quot;Les Violets&quot; won the Coupe de France in 2023, and have won the second tier Ligue 2 on three occasions. Toulouse have participated in European competition six times, including in 2007 when they qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time. 

The president of Toulouse FC is Damien Comolli, who succeeded the French businessman Olivier Sadran who took over the club following its bankruptcy in 2001 which resulted in it being relegated to the Championnat National. The club has served as a springboard for several players, most notably the World Cup-winning goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, international strikers André-Pierre Gignac, Martin Braithwaite and Wissam Ben Yedder.

==History==
The city was left without a big side in 1967 when Toulouse FC sold its players and place in the French top flight to Paris outfit Red Star, but three years later a new club, Union Sportive Toulouse, rose from the ashes. Adopting red and yellow jerseys, the club started out in Ligue 2 and in 1979 reclaimed the name Toulouse FC. Now wearing purple and white, &quot;Les Pitchouns&quot; gained top-flight promotion in 1982. A side containing Jacques Santini and Swiss forward Daniel Jeandupeux earned a penalty shoot-out victory against Diego Maradona&#x27;s Napoli in the 1986–87 UEFA Cup, Toulouse&#x27;s maiden European campaign.
After goalkeeper Fabien Barthez made his breakthrough and moved on, Toulouse were relegated in 1994. They subsequently bounced back and forth between Ligues 1 and 2 before slipping to the third flight in 2001 after financial problems. Toulouse were back in the top flight two seasons later, and in 2007 they finished third to earn a place in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round. There, Liverpool overpowered them 5–0 on aggregate.

In 2008–09, Toulouse finished fourth in the Ligue 1 table with 64 points, and secured a spot in the new Europa League, while André-Pierre Gignac led all scorers in Ligue 1 with 24 goals and was awarded a call-up to the France national team.

In the 2015–16 Ligue 1 season, Toulouse avoided relegation to Ligue 2 in the last game of the season. With 12 minutes to go, Toulouse were behind to Angers 2–1 and needed a win to survive, and scored two late goals and won the match 3–2. Two years later, they finished 18th and won the promotion/relegation playoff 4–0 on aggregate against Ligue 2&#x27;s AC Ajaccio.

On 6 January 2020, Toulouse dismissed manager Antoine Kombouaré following the club&#x27;s 1–0 loss to Championnat National 2 side Saint-Pryvé Saint-Hilaire in the Coupe de France. Under Kombouaré the club had lost ten matches in a row, leading him to be dismissed and replaced by Denis Zanko. On 30 April that year, Toulouse were relegated to Ligue 2 after the LFP elected to end the season early due to the coronavirus pandemic.

On 21 July 2020, RedBird Capital Partners acquired an 85% stake in Toulouse FC. The club achieved promotion back to Ligue 1 by winning the second tier, Ligue 2, in 2022. On 29 April 2023, Toulouse won its first-ever Coupe de France title, defeating Kombouaré&#x27;s Nantes in the final by a score of 5–1.
It was the city&#x27;s second title, however, as the former Toulouse FC had won it back in 1957.

==Name changes==
* Union Sportive Toulouse (1970–79)
* Toulouse Football Club (1979–current)

==Stadium==
Toulouse play their home matches at the Stadium de Toulouse. Built in 1937, the stadium presently has a capacity of 33,150. The stadium was used as a venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 2007 Rugby Union World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016.

==Colours==
The violet is a reference to one of two Toulouse nicknames: &quot;la Cité des violettes&quot; (the City of Violets), the second one being &quot;la Ville rose&quot; (the Pink City), which explains the colour of former alternate jerseys. The team&#x27;s logo displays the gold and blood-red Occitan cross, the symbol of Occitania, of which Toulouse is a historical capital.

==Club rivalries==

===Derby de la Garonne===

The Derby de la Garonne is a derby match between Girondins de Bordeaux and Toulouse. The derby derives from the fact that Bordeaux and Toulouse are the two major cities in south-western France, both of which are situated on the Garonne River. The consistency and competitiveness of the rivalry developed following Toulouse&#x27;s return to Ligue 1 after being administratively relegated to the Championnat National in 2001.

<text>Johnson Thomas Umunnakwe Aguiyi-Ironsi (3 March 1924 – 29 July 1966) was a Nigerian general who was the first military head of state of Nigeria. He was appointed after the 1966 Nigerian coup d&#x27;état. Ironsi ruled from 16 January, until his assassination on 29 July 1966. He was asssinated by a group of military officers from the Northern Region led by Murtala Mohammed.

== Early life ==
Ironsi was born on 3 March 1924 in Ibeku, Umuahia, British Nigeria. His father was Ezeugo Aguiyi. He took the last name of his brother-in-law as his first name in admiration of Mr. Johnson for the father-figure role that he played in his life.

Aguiyi-Ironsi had his primary and secondary school education in Umuahia and Kano, respectively. At the age of 18, he joined the Nigeria Regiment against the wishes of his sister, Anyamma.

==Military career==
In 1942, Aguiyi-Ironsi joined the Nigerian Regiment, as a private with the seventh battalion. He was promoted in 1946 to company sergeant major. Also in 1946, Aguiyi-Ironsi was sent on an officer training course in Staff College, Camberley, England. On 12 June 1949, after completion of his course at Camberley, he received a short-service commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal West African Frontier Force, with a subsequent retroactive promotion to lieutenant effective from the same date.

Aguiyi-Ironsi was granted a regular commission on 16 May 1953 (seniority from 8 October 1947), and was promoted to captain with effect from the same date (seniority from 8 October 1951).

Aguiyi-Ironsi was one of the officers who served as equerry for Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Nigeria when she visited Nigeria in 1956 and so he was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO). He was promoted to Major on 8 October 1958.

In 1960, Aguiyi-Ironsi was made commanding officer of the fifth battalion in Kano, Nigeria, with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Later in 1960, Aguiyi-Ironsi headed the Nigerian contingent force of the United Nations Operation in the Congo. From 1961 to 1962, Aguiyi-Ironsi served as the military attaché to the Nigeria High Commission in London, United Kingdom. During that period he was promoted to the rank of brigadier. During his tenure as military attaché, he attended courses at the Imperial Defence college (renamed Royal College of Defence Studies in 1961), Seaford House, Belgrave Square. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, Military Division (MBE) in the 1962 New Year Honours list.

In 1964, he was appointed as the commandant of the entire United Nations peace keeping force in the Congo.

In 1965, Aguiyi-Ironsi was promoted to the rank of major general. The same year, Major General C.B. Welby-Everard handed over his position as the general officer Commanding, GOC of the entire Nigerian Army to Major General Johnson Thomas Umunnakwe Aguiyi-Ironsi, which made him the first Nigeria indigenous officer to head the entire Nigerian Army.

In January 1966, a group of army officers, led by Major Chukwuma Nzeogwu, overthrew the central and regional governments of Nigeria, killed the prime minister and tried to take control of the government in a failed coup d&#x27;état. Nzeogwu was countered, captured and imprisoned by Major General Aguiyi-Ironsi.

Aguiyi-Ironsi was named military head of state on 17 January 1966, a position he held until 29 July 1966, when a group of Northern army officers revolted against the government and killed Aguiyi-Ironsi.

== Fall of the Republic ==

On 15 January 1966, young radical and revolutionary soldiers drawn from different tribal extractions, led by Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu, from Okpanam near Asaba, Noé in Delta State, eradicated the uppermost echelon of politicians from the Northern and the Western Provinces. That and other factors effectively led to the fall of the Republican Government. Aguiyi-Ironsi, an Igbo, was purportedly slated for assassination but effectively took control of Lagos, the Federal Capital Territory. Also an Igbo, President Nnamdi Azikiwe refusing to intervene to ensure the continuity of civilian rule, Aguiyi-Ironsi effectively compelled the remaining members of Balewa&#x27;s government to resign. Seeing that the government was in disarray, Aguiya-Ironsi then allowed Senate President Nwafor Orizu, another Igbo who was serving as acting president in Azikiwe&#x27;s absence, to surrender power to him officially, which ended the First Nigerian Republic.

==Head of state==
Aguiyi-Ironsi inherited a Nigeria that was deeply fractured by its ethnic and religious cleavages. None of the high-profile victims of the 1966 coup was of Igbo extraction. Aguiyi Ironsi, who was the most senior officer alive as at the morning of 15 January 1966. after managing to survive the coup by outwitting the coup plotters, he proceeded to rally some troops loyal to him and was able to crush the coup. The perception of many, including the Northern and Western soldiers that no high-profile politician of Igbo extraction was killed, added to the emergence of yet another Igbo General as the leader of the Military Government of Nigeria, led people of the northern part the country to believe that it had been an Igbo conspiracy. Though Aguiyi-Ironsi tried to dispel that notion by courting the aggrieved ethnic groups through political appointments and patronage, his failure to punish the coup plotters and the promulgation of the now-infamous &quot;Decree No. 34&quot;, which abrogated the country&#x27;s federal structure in exchange for a unitary one, crystallized the conspiracy theory.

During his short regime (194 days in office), Aguiyi-Ironsi promulgated a raft of decrees. Among them were the Constitution Suspension and Amendment Decree No.1, which suspended most articles of the Constitution though it left intact those sections that dealt with fundamental human rights, freedom of expression and conscience. The Circulation of Newspaper Decree No.2 removed the restrictions on press freedom that had been put in place by the preceding civilian administration. According to Ndayo Uko, the decree was to serve &quot;as a kind gesture to the press&quot; to safeguard himself when he went on later to promulgate the Defamatory and Offensive Decree No.44 of 1966, which made it an &quot;offense to display or pass on pictorial representation, sing songs, or play instruments the words of which are likely to provoke any section of the country&quot;.

==The July counter coup==
On 29 July 1966, Aguiyi Ironsi spent the night at the Government House in Ibadan, as part of a nationwide tour. His host, Lieutenant Colonel Adekunle Fajuyi, military governor of Western Nigeria, alerted him to a possible mutiny within the army. Aguiyi-Ironsi desperately tried to contact his Army Chief of Staff, Yakubu Gowon, but he was unreachable. In the early hours of the morning, the Government House, Ibadan, was surrounded by soldiers led by Theophilus Danjuma.

== Arrest and assassination ==
Danjuma arrested Aguiyi-Ironsi and questioned him about his alleged complicity in the coup, which saw the demise of the Sardauna of Sokoto, Ahmadu Bello. The circumstances leading to Aguiyi-Ironsi&#x27;s death have remained a subject of much controversy in Nigeria until now people claimed it had something to do related on his nicknames and legend. His body and that of Fajuyi were later discovered in a nearby forest.

==Legend==
The swagger stick with a stuffed crocodile mascot carried by Aguiyi-Ironsi was called &quot;Charlie&quot;. Legend had it that the crocodile mascot made him invulnerable and that it was used to dodge or deflect bullets when he was on mission in the Congo. Despite the stories, the crocodile mascot probably had something to do with the fact that the name &quot;Aguiyi&quot; translates as &quot;crocodile&quot; in Igbo.

==Personal life==
Aguiyi-Ironsi was married to Victoria Ironsi. His son, Thomas Aguiyi-Ironsi, was appointed to the position of Nigeria&#x27;s Defence Minister on 30 August 2006, forty years after his father&#x27;s death.

==Award==
The Gallantry Medal was awarded by the Austrian government to Lieutenant Colonel Aguiyi-Ironsi, Maj Njoku, two expatriates and twelve Nigerian soldiers for their role in the Congo in 1960 in freeing an Austrian ambulance unit, which had been arrested and imprisoned by the Congolese authorities because it claimed to be Belgian parachutists.

<text>Istres Football Club (; commonly referred to as simply Istres) is a French association football club based in Istres. The club was formed in 1920 and currently play their home matches at the Stade Parsemain in Fos-sur-Mer, a commune in the Arrondissement of Istres.

== History ==
FC Istres was founded in 1920 by Édouard Guizonnier as SS Istréenne. In 1969, SS Istréenne was merged into the more general sports club Istres Sports, who chose to keep Istréenne&#x27;s distinctive purple and black colours. In 1977 the club made young entrepreneur Michel Aviet the club&#x27;s president and ex-Yugoslav goalkeeper Georges Korac the club&#x27;s manager. During the Aviet-Korac years, the club advanced from France&#x27;s lower amateur regional divisions all the way up to Ligue 2. 

In the 2004–05 season, the club reached Ligue 1 for the first time in its history but finished last and was relegated to Ligue 2. Istres returned to Ligue 2 in the 2009–10 season after winning the Championnat National 2008–09. After five seasons in Ligue 2, they were relegated at the end of the 2013–14 season after a 4–2 loss to Dijon FCO. They were briefly readmitted to Ligue 2 when Luzenac was denied promotion due to stadium requirements. However, on 11 July 2014, following the reversal of a ruling against Valenciennes, Istres&#x27; relegation was confirmed, and they returned to the Championnat National.

In July 2015, the club was relegated to the seventh tier due to financial issues. On 12 March 2016, it was renamed Istres Football Club, with President Alain Christmann explaining, &quot;The entity &#x27;Ouest Provence&#x27; no longer exists, so this change is more logical. It&#x27;s not a revolution, but it needed to be done.&quot; Successive promotions in 2017 and 2018 elevated the club to the Championnat National 3, with another promotion to the Championnat National 2 in 2024.

<doc id="1256469" wikidata="Q1894863" url="?curid=1256469" title="Margaret McDonagh, Baroness McDonagh">
<text>Margaret Josephine McDonagh, Baroness McDonagh (26 June 1961 – 24 June 2023) was a British Labour politician who served as General Secretary of the Labour Party from 1998 to 2001. She later worked as a management consultant and was a co-president of the Labour Party Irish Society, and sat in the House of Lords as a life peer from 2004 until her death.

== Early life and education ==
Margaret Josephine McDonagh was born on 26 June 1961 in Mitcham, Surrey, to an Irish family. She was the younger of two daughters of Cumin McDonagh, a construction labourer, and Breda McDonagh (), a psychiatric nurse. Her elder sister was Siobhain McDonagh, who was elected the Labour member of Parliament for Mitcham and Morden in 1997. Margaret was educated at Holy Cross School in New Malden and gained a Bachelor of Science degree in government at Brunel University London and a Master of Arts in advanced marketing at Kingston Business School, and later completed an Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School.

== Career ==
McDonagh was part of the New Labour leadership inner circle for the 1997 general election campaign and was one of the inner-core deciding the official party position on specific issues.

In 1998, McDonagh became Labour&#x27;s first female general secretary, after having served as deputy general secretary and general election campaign co-ordinator the previous year. She was not always popular with the grassroots and parts of the Parliamentary Party due to her perceived &quot;control-freakery&quot;. She was considered to have badly mishandled the party&#x27;s London mayoral candidate selection process, which resulted in Ken Livingstone winning 2000 mayoral election as an independent candidate, leaving the official Labour candidate, Frank Dobson, in third place, with subsequent disapproval amongst the party members. McDonagh later apologised for the mayoral electoral loss. Her organisational skills came to the fore however in the delivery of two general election landslide victories in the 1997 and 2001 general election. She was also criticised for accepting, without consultation, a £100,000 donation from &quot;Daily Express&quot; and adult magazine publisher Richard Desmond, and for still counting as party members those in arrears of up to 15 months to delay news of declining membership emerging.

After stepping down from the position of General Secretary following the 2001 general election, McDonagh took a short Harvard University business course and became general manager of Express Newspapers. She was a non-executive director of Standard Life, TBI plc, and CareCapital Group plc. She was chair of the Standard Life Charitable Trust.

McDonagh became a life peer on 24 June 2004, and was created &quot;Baroness McDonagh, of Mitcham and of Morden in the London Borough of Merton&quot;.

In 2013, McDonagh was appointed chair of the Smart Meter Central Delivery Body, which then became Smart Energy GB, an independent organisation that aims to inform consumers about smart meters and their national rollout across Great Britain.

==Personal life==
McDonagh lived with her sister Siobhain in Colliers Wood, London, for most of their adult lives. She was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2021. In March 2023 her sister took a £1.2 million interest-free loan from Labour donor Lord Alli, to buy a house in south-west London with downstairs bedroom and bathroom suited for her terminally ill sister.

She died on 24 June 2023, at age 61, and 19 years to the day after she was first appointed to the Lords. She was described as the &quot;linchpin&quot; of New Labour. Pat McFadden wrote that she was a &quot;true working-class hero&quot;.

==Legacy==
At Labour Party Conference 2023 it was announced that the Labour party would be launching the Margaret McDonagh Leadership Academy in her honour. David Evans, the General Secretary of the Labour Party, speaking at the launch of the Academy said it will &quot;ensure that future generations will also know Margaret&quot;.

<doc id="1256470" wikidata="Q7411943" url="?curid=1256470" title="Samuel L. Gouverneur">
<text>Samuel Laurence Gouverneur (1799 – September 29, 1865) was a lawyer and civil servant who was both nephew and son-in-law to James Monroe, the fifth President of the United States.

==Early life==
Gouverneur was born in 1799 in New York City. His father was Nicholas Gouverneur (1753–1802), a merchant with the firm Gouverneur &amp; Kemble, and mother was Hester (née Kortright) Gouverneur (1770–1842), sister of the First Lady Elizabeth Kortright Monroe. His younger sister, Maria Charlotte Gouverneur (1801–1867), was married to Thomas McCall Cadwalader (1795–1873).

His maternal grandparents were Lawrence Kortright, a wealthy merchant, and Hannah (née Aspinwall) Kortright. His paternal grandparents were Samuel Gouverneur (1720–1798) and Experience (née Johnson) Gouverneur (1720–1788). He was a first cousin of U.S. Representative Gouverneur Kemble (1786–1875) through his aunt Gertrude Gouverneur, wife of merchant Peter Kemble.

He graduated from Columbia College in 1817.

==Career==
In 1824, Gouverneur was elected as a People&#x27;s Party (faction of the Democratic-Republican party) member of the New York State Assembly, serving in the 48th New York State Legislature in 1825. He was aligned with Assembly Speaker Clarkson Crolius, also from New York County.

On November 19, 1828, he was appointed Postmaster of New York City, succeeding former U.S. Representative and Senator Theodorus Bailey who died in office on September 6, 1828. While in New York he invested in racehorses, and the Bowery Theatre along with James Alexander Hamilton, son of Alexander Hamilton, and Prosper M. Wetmore. Gouverneur served as Postmaster until July 4, 1836, when he was succeeded by Jonathan J. Coddington.

===Relationship with Monroe===
Gouverneur served as private secretary to his uncle, the fifth U.S. President James Monroe who served two consecutive terms as President from March 4, 1817 until March 4, 1825. Gouverneur helped former president Monroe to press his claims to Congress to repay mounting debts. After Elizabeth Monroe&#x27;s death in 1830, Monroe came to live at the Gouverneurs&#x27; home, and died there in 1831. Gouverneur was executor of Monroe&#x27;s estate, which had to be sold off to pay the debts.

Monroe was buried in the Gouverneur family vault at the New York City Marble Cemetery, until descendants had the remains moved to the James Monroe Tomb in the Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. A ceremony was held at the Gouverneur vault 175 years later, on July 8, 2006.

Monroe&#x27;s personal papers were left to Gouverneur, who also was asked to support his wife&#x27;s sister Eliza Monroe Hay (also his cousin, then a widow). Gouverneur started work on publishing the papers or a book on Monroe, but it was never finished. After Mrs. Hay died in 1840, the Gouverneurs moved to Washington, DC where he worked in the consular bureau of the U.S. Department of State from 1844 to 1849. After congress agreed to buy the papers of President Madison, Gouverneur proposed a similar arrangement, which was concluded in 1850. Some personal papers would be retained for a few generations.

==Personal life==
On March 9, 1820, Gouverneur was married to Maria Hester Monroe, his first cousin and the daughter of President Monroe. The wedding was officiated by the Rev. William Dickinson Hawley and was the first wedding held in the White House for a child of a president. The wedding was small, with only 42 guests and no cabinet members invited, and General Thomas Jesup served as groomsman for Gouverneur. The couple went on a brief one-week honeymoon, and upon their return, Commodore and Mrs. Stephen Decatur gave them a reception at the Decatur House on May 20, 1820. Another ball was planned, but was cancelled due to Decatur&#x27;s death two days later in a duel. After moving to New York, the Gouverneur&#x27;s bought and lived at 63 and 65 Prince Street at Lafayette Street in Manhattan. Together, Samuel and Maria were the parents of four children:

* a daughter, who died in infancy (d. September 4, 1821)
* James Monroe Gouverneur (1822–1885), a deaf-mute who died at the Spring Grove Asylum in Baltimore, Maryland;
* Elizabeth Kortright Gouverneur (1824–1868), who married Dr. Henry Lee Heishell, James M. Bibby, and Colonel G. D. Sparrier.
* Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, Jr. (1826–1880), who married Marian Campbell (1821–1914), and became the first U.S. consul in Fuzhou, China (then spelled Foo Chow).

In 1832, the Gouverneurs&#x27; sold their Prince Street residence to Miles R. Burke. On June 20, 1850, his wife Maria died at the Oak Hill estate, which was sold two years later in 1852.

In September 1851, the widower Gouverneur married Mary Digges Lee (1810–1898), a granddaughter of Thomas Sim Lee (1745–1819). They retired to the Lee estate called &quot;Needwood&quot;, near Frederick, Maryland and Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. This stressed family relations during the American Civil War, with Gouverneur associated with the Union government, while his in-laws had deep roots in the Confederate states.

==Death==
Gouverneur died at his Needwood estate on September 29, 1865. His estate was left to his second wife.

==Family==
===Descendants===
His granddaughter Rose de Chine Gouverneur, born in China in 1860, married Roswell Randall Hoes (1850–1921) and died on May 26, 1933. Their sons Gouverneur Hoes (1889–1943) and Laurence Gouverneur Hoes (1900–1978) established the James Monroe Museum and Memorial Library in the Fredericksburg, Virginia building that housed the James Monroe Law Office, administered by the University of Mary Washington.

<text>Rat Island is a privately owned island in New York City. It is approximately in size and located in City Island Harbor, which is a part of Long Island Sound. It is about halfway between City Island and Hart Island and south of High Island. It is one of the Pelham Islands.

==Description==

The small irregular island is about in area. It has a dual-humped appearance and is mostly a lump of Manhattan schist bedrock. There is a small channel that cuts into the bedrock on the southern side of the tiny island that was used for launching small boats. This channel is filled with mussel shells. There is a purple-bluish &quot;beach&quot; made of mussel shells mixed with bird bones on the west side of the island with some reed grass.

The highest point on the island is usually covered in gull bird guano and is underwater during high tide storms. Great blue herons have been seen on the island.

==History==
Rat Island was included in the purchase by Thomas Pell in 1654. During the typhoid fever scares of the 1800s, Rat Island was used by Pelham, New York, as a typhoid quarantine hospital for about 40 infected people called the &quot;Pelham Pesthouse&quot;. The remains of cobblestone walls and foundations are still there. It was abandoned due to storm floods. Local legends say there was also a lighthouse for a while.

New York City purchased the island in 1888. It became a mini-colony for writers and artists in the early 20th century. It was bought by Dr. H. A. Parmentier in 1908. He subsequently leased the island to the Mount Vernon Club in 1931.

It was owned by a Brooklyn lawyer until 1972 when it was sold to Edmund &quot;Red&quot; Brennen. He said he bought it to do salvage work and store equipment. For many years crane buckets and lattice booms and other equipment were visible. In March 2009 Brennen put Rat Island up for sale for $300,000. On September 26, 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article about the island, stating the property would go up for auction on October 2, 2011. It was sold at that auction for $160,000 to 71-year-old retired Port Authority worker Alex Schibli, a Swiss resident of nearby City Island. Schibli said he has no immediate plans for physical changes to the island, but is considering renaming it Malina Island after his granddaughter.

In summer months, a couple dozen people may come to the island. In the past, during summer the Parks Department used to put waste drums so they may contain their garbage. Sometimes, the local first responders use it to practice rescue missions with boats and helicopters.

In August 2016, a polyester copy of the statue of the Swiss freedom fighter William Tell was erected on the island for the 725th Swiss National Day. The original is located in Altdorf, Uri, Switzerland. In March 2017, Schibli was sued unsuccessfully in a &quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot; episode for fees charged by an engineer whom he asked to give an estimate on what was needed to put a more permanent statue of William Tell on the island.

==Name==
It is not known how the island received its name. It has been proposed by Red Brennan and others including former prison workers that prisoners escaping from Hart Island nearby, nicknamed &quot;rats&quot;, used the small island to rest before swimming on to City Island and freedom. Another theory is that when the island housed typhoid victims in the 19th century it presumably attracted vermin.

According to Schibli, the island&#x27;s original name was &quot;Rattle Island,&quot; because rattling noisemakers were used to ward off ships.

<text>Glenn Ligon (born 1960, pronounced Lie-gōne) is an American conceptual artist whose work explores race, language, desire, sexuality, and identity. Based in New York City, Ligon&#x27;s work often draws on 20th century literature and speech of 20th century cultural figures such as James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, Gertrude Stein, Jean Genet, and Richard Pryor. He is noted as one of the originators of the term Post-Blackness.

== Early life and career ==
Ligon was born in 1960 in the Forest Houses Projects in the south Bronx. When he was seven, his divorced, working-class parents were able to get scholarships for him and his older brother to attend Walden School, a high-quality, progressive, private school on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. Ligon enrolled at the Rhode Island School of Design, where he spent two years before transferring to Wesleyan University. He graduated from Wesleyan with a B.A. in 1982. 

After graduating, he worked as a proofreader for a law firm, while in his spare time he painted, working in the abstract Expressionist style of Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock. In 1985, he participated in the Whitney Museum of American Art&#x27;s Independent Study Program. He continues to live and work in New York City.

While he started his career as an abstract painter, he began to introduce text and words into his work during the mid-1980s in order to better express his political concerns and ideas about racial identity. Most of the text that he used came from prominent African-American writers (James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, and Ralph Ellison).

Ligon gained prominence in the early 1990s, along with a generation of artists including Janine Antoni, Renée Green, Marlon Riggs, Gary Simmons, and Lorna Simpson.

== Personal life ==
Ligon lives in Tribeca. He has served on the board of directors of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts (FCA). He currently serves on the Board of directors for the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation (), The Pulitzer Foundation (), and LAXART (). His Brooklyn studio is near where artist friends Paul Ramirez Jonas and Byron Kim also work.

== Work ==
Ligon works in multiple media, including painting, neon, video, and photography based works. His work is greatly informed by his experiences as a gay African American man living in the United States.

=== Text-based Works ===
Although Ligon&#x27;s work spans sculptures, prints, drawings, mixed media and neon, painting remains a core activity. He has incorporated texts into his paintings, in the form of literary fragments, jokes, and evocative quotes from a selection of authors, which he stencils directly onto the canvas by hand. His source materials concern issues of the lives of black Americans throughout history.

In 1990, he mounted his first solo show, &quot;How It Feels to Be Colored Me,&quot; in Brooklyn. This show established Ligon&#x27;s reputation for creating large, text-based paintings in which a phrase chosen from literature or other sources is repeated continuously. Smudges and streaks from stenciled text layer until the repeated lines become obscured. &quot;Untitled (I Am a Man)&quot; (1988), a reinterpretation of the signs carried during the Memphis sanitation strike in 1968 — made famous by Ernest Withers&#x27;s photographs of the march — is the first example of his use of text. In several other paintings, he overlaps repeating text to a point of illegibility, demanding the viewer&#x27;s attention as they try to make out the obscured words. Ligon&#x27;s &quot;Prologue Series #2&quot; (1991) includes the opening text of Ralph Ellison&#x27;s &quot;Invisible Man&quot;, stenciled in various shades of black and grey, the words becoming less discernible as they progress towards the bottom of the composition. He uses this same passage of text in &quot;Prologue Series #5&quot; (1991), but obscures the words further, creating a further sense of abstraction and ambiguity about the subject.

In 1993, Ligon began his series of paintings based on Richard Pryor&#x27;s groundbreaking stand-up comedy routines from the 1970s.
In Ligon&#x27;s &quot;Stranger&quot; series, he pursues a career long exploration of paintings based on James Baldwin&#x27;s 1953 essay Stranger in the Village. This series began in 1996 with selected excepts rendered in Ligon&#x27;s stenciling technique that gradually reduces the legibility of the text on the canvas. In 2021, Ligon culminates this series by presenting the essay in full in large scale text-based paintings.

Glenn Ligon&#x27;s &quot;Debris Field&quot; series began with etchings in 2012. In 2018 he extended this series to paintings. These paintings are also made with stencils but they do not reference pre-existing texts, literature, or speech acts from cultural figures directly. Instead the &quot;Debris Field&quot; series uses stencils of letterforms that Ligon has created. The letterforms are arranged in all-over compositions on the canvas. Though recognizable as letters, the stenciled shapes also stack and layer on the canvas, furthering Ligon&#x27;s career long engagement with issues of legibility, and tension between figuration and abstraction.

=== &quot;To Disembark&quot; (1993) and &quot;Runaways&quot; (1993) ===
In 1993, Ligon&#x27;s &quot;To Disembark&quot; was presented at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. The title references to the title of a book of poetry by Gwendolyn Brooks. This show connected the legacy of American slavery to current racial injustices and evoked the recognition that African Americans are still coping with the remnants of slavery and its manifestation in racism. In the titular work of the exhibition &quot;Untitled (To Disembark)&quot; from 1993, Ligon created a series of packing crates modeled after the one described by ex-slave Henry &quot;Box&quot; Brown in his &quot;Narrative of Henry Box Brown who escaped from Slavery Enclosed in a Box 3 Feet Long and 2 Wide.&quot; Brown was a slave who escaped slavery by shipping himself from Virginia to freedom in Philadelphia via a box crate. &quot;To Disembark&quot; the exhibition centers around nine crates that Ligon constructed and dispersed throughout the gallery. Ligon also took note of how Brown was allegedly singing when he arrived in Philadelphia. To incorporate this element, Ligon placed speakers inside the crates quietly playing songs such as &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; sung by Billie Holiday and &quot;Sound of da Police&quot; by KRS-one. Each crate played a different sound, such as a heartbeat, a spiritual, or contemporary rap music. The juxtaposition of all of the songs, spanning a century, is an auditory element which creates a chorus across time, further exposing the lasting effects of slavery. &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; has been used by other black artists such as Hank Willis Thomas in his photography series of the same name.

Also included in this exhibition is &quot;Runaways&quot; (1993) a suite of 10 lithographs. Ligon asked friends to describe him and then included these descriptions as text in a series of posters depicting himself as a runaway slave in the style of 19th-century broadsheets circulated to advertise for the return of fugitive slaves.

In another part of in the exhibition, Ligon stenciled four quotes from a 1928 Zora Neale Hurston essay, &quot;How It Feels To Be Colored Me&quot;, directly on the walls: &quot;I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background,&quot; &quot;I remember the very day that I became colored,&quot; &quot;I am not tragically colored,&quot; and &quot;I do not always feel colored.&quot; Ligon found Hurston&#x27;s writing illuminating because she explores the idea of race as a concept that is structured by context rather than essence.

=== &quot;Notes on the Margin of the Black Book&quot; (1991-1993) ===
In &quot;Notes on the Margin of the Black Book&quot; (1991-1993), Ligon addresses Robert Mapplethorpe&#x27;s photographs of black men from his 1996 book titled, &quot;Black Book&quot;. Ligon cut pages from &quot;Black Book&quot; and framed 91 photographs&quot;,&quot; installing them in two horizontal rows. Between them are two more rows of small framed typed texts, 78 comments on sexuality, race, AIDS, art and the controversy over Mapplethorpe&#x27;s work that was launched by then-Texas Congressman Dick Armey. Ligon explicitly points out the problems of these visuals in Mapplethorpe&#x27;s book with his row of textual placards between the rows of photographs. These images, because they were first published in Mapplethorpe&#x27;s book, had a limited the scope under which they were viewed. Ligon, however, made these pictures public in presentation, in a museum: Ligon forced viewers to look at these images in a room full of others. This act allows for open discussion of the images and the politics surrounding them.

=== &quot;Feast of Scraps&quot; (1994-98) ===
In &quot;A Feast of Scraps&quot; (1994–98), he inserted images of black men sourced from pornographic magazines, complete with invented captions (&quot;mother knew,&quot; &quot;I fell out&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s a process&quot;) into albums of family snapshots including graduation photographs, vacation snapshots, pictures of baby showers, birthday celebrations, and baptisms. Some of the latter photos include the artist&#x27;s own family. Photography is used as a way of representing multiple identities through the disruption of images, which expresses the fragmentation of black identity, specifically the artist&#x27;s own identity. Ligon acknowledges that sexuality is something that is not necessarily visible, so it can be erased in photographs such as photos from his teenage years. The imagery causes the viewer to imagine other aspects of identity and narrative of those depicted in these photographs. This project draws from the secret histories and submerged meanings of inherited texts and images.

=== Coloring book series ===
Another series of large paintings is based on children&#x27;s coloring on drawings of iconic figures in 1970s black-history coloring books. This series began when Ligon was an artist in residence at the Walker Art Museum in 1999-2000. There he worked with school children to color on the pages of found coloring books. The resulting works are a series of paintings and drawings made with silkscreen and paint on canvas and paper that are renderings of the children&#x27;s interventions. Figures such as Malcolm X, Harriet Tubman, and Issac Hayes are depicted in these works.

=== Neons ===

Since 2005, Ligon has made neon works. &quot;Warm Broad Glow&quot; (2005), Ligon&#x27;s first exploration in neon, uses a fragment of text from &quot;Three Lives&quot;, the 1909 novel by American author Gertrude Stein. Ligon rendered the words &quot;negro sunshine&quot; in warm white neon, the letters of which were then painted black on the front. In 2008, the piece was shown in the Renaissance Society&#x27;s group exhibit, &quot;Black Is, Black Ain&#x27;t&quot;. It was installed in the lobby window of the Whitney Museum in 2011. Other neon works are derived from neon sculptures by Bruce Nauman. &quot;One Live and Die&quot; (2006) stems from Nauman&#x27;s &quot;100 Live and Die&quot; (1984), for example.

Ligon&#x27;s large-scale installation &quot;A Small Band (2015)&quot; consists of three neon pieces illuminating the words &quot;blues,&quot; &quot;blood,&quot; and &quot;bruise.&quot; Commissioned for the facade of the Central Pavilion at the fifty-sixth Venice Biennale, the work has been subsequently arranged in a new, site-specific formations at the Stony Island Arts Bank in Chicago, Illinois, the Pulitzer Arts Foundation in St. Louis, Missouri, and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia and on the exterior facade of the New Museum in New York, NY as part of the exhibition Grief and Grievance . The three words of &quot;A Small Band&quot; reference composer Steve Reich&#x27;s 1966 sound piece &quot;Come Out,&quot; which looped a fragment of the recorded testimony of Daniel Hamm, who was one of the Harlem Six, a group of young black men wrongly accused and convicted of murder in the mid-1960s.
Ligon has created other large-scale installations using neon. &quot;Des Parisiens Noirs&quot; (2019) is an installation depicting the names of 13 Black models from historic paintings which was presented on an interior facade of the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, in Paris. This solo project was presented alongside &quot;Black Models: From Géricault to Matisse&quot; an exhibition centering the models of African descent whose likenesses are presented in historic paintings and whose biographical details have largely been discovered through archival research. Laure who modeled for Manet&#x27;s Olympia for example, is one of the thirteen names of black models that Ligon displays in neon. One of the 13 neons included in this work reads &quot;nom inconnu&quot; or name unknown to acknowledge the models whose names have not yet been traced.

In 2021, Ligon was commissioned to create &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot; for the exhibition &quot;Portals&quot; organized by the Hellenic Parliament and NEON in the atrium of the former Public Tobacco Factory in Athens, Greece. &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot; (2021), uses the final two lines of C. P. Cavafy&#x27;s 1904 poem of the same title. In one translation, these final lines read: &quot;&quot;Now what&#x27;s going to happen to us without barbarians? Those people were a kind of solution&quot;.&quot; His neon installation consists of nine English translations, each different from the other revealing the variations in the translation&#x27;s meanings and the othering role that the Barbarians were forced into. With Cavafy&#x27;s verses, Ligon is addressing cultural supremacy and its dependency on othering relation, but the tense of the lines also suggest a time when othering as a solution has past.

=== &quot;The Death of Tom&quot; (2008) ===
In 2008, Ligon completed a short film entitled &quot;The Death of Tom&quot;. It is based on Thomas Edison&#x27;s 1903 silent film &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Playing the character of Tom, Ligon had himself filmed re-creating the last scene of Edison&#x27;s movie, from which he took his title. But the film was incorrectly loaded in the hand-crank camera that the artist used, so no imagery appeared on film. Embracing this apparent failure, Ligon decided to show his film as an abstract progression of light and shadow with a narrative suggested by the score composed and played by jazz musician Jason Moran.

== Exhibitions ==
In 2011 the Whitney Museum of American Art held a mid-career retrospective of Ligon&#x27;s work, &quot;Glenn Ligon: America&quot;, organized by Scott Rothkopf, that traveled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Important recent shows include: &quot;Grief and Grievance &quot; (2021), at the New Museum, where Ligon acted as a curatorial advisor; &quot;Des Parisiens Noirs&quot; at the Musées d&#x27;Orsay, Paris (2019); &quot;Blue Black&quot; (2017), an exhibition Ligon curated at the Pulitzer Arts Foundation in St. Louis, inspired by the site-specific Ellsworth Kelly wall sculpture; and &quot;Glenn Ligon: Encounters and Collisions&quot; (2015), a curatorial project organized with Nottingham Contemporary and Tate Liverpool. Ligon has also been the subject of solo museum exhibitions at the Camden Arts Centre in London, the Power Plant in Toronto, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and the Studio Museum in Harlem, among others. His work has been included in major international exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale (2015 and 1997), Berlin Biennal (2014), Istanbul Biennal (2011, 2019), Documenta XI (2002), and Gwangju Biennale (2000).

In 2012, Ligon was commissioned to create the first site-specific artwork for the New School&#x27;s University Center building, designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, on the corner of 14th Street and Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. The work, &quot;For Comrades and Lovers&quot; (2015), features about 400 feet of text from Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; rendered in violet neon light, running around the top of a wall in the center&#x27;s first-floor café.

== Recognition ==
In 2003, Ligon was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship. In 2005, he won an Alphonse Fletcher Foundation Fellowship for his art work. In 2006 he was awarded the Skowhegan Medal for Painting. In 2009, he received the Studio Museum&#x27;s Joyce Alexander Wein Artist Prize. In 2010, he won a United States Artists Fellow award.

In 2009, President Barack Obama added Ligon&#x27;s 1992 &quot;Black Like Me No. 2&quot;, on loan from the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, to the White House collection, where it was installed in the President&#x27;s private living quarters. The text in the selected painting is from John Howard Griffin&#x27;s 1961 memoir &quot;Black Like Me&quot;, the account of a white man&#x27;s experiences traveling through the South after he had his skin artificially darkened. The words &quot;All traces of the Griffin I had been were wiped from existence&quot; are repeated in capital letters that progressively overlap until they coalesce as a field of black paint. At the annual Gala in the Garden at the Hammer Museum in 2018, he was honored by attorney and social justice advocate Bryan Stevenson.

In 2018, Ligon was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from The New School.

In 2021, Ligon was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

<text>The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time is a collection of 24 short films by the English rock band Radiohead. It accompanies their 2003 album &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;, and comprises music videos, live performances, webcast footage and videos submitted by fans. The material was first broadcast on Radiohead&#x27;s website in 2003 and released on DVD on 1 December 2004.

==Content==
&quot;The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time&quot; comprises 24 short films that accompany Radiohead&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;. It was created with the filmmaker Chris Bran and Radiohead&#x27;s longtime collaborator Stanley Donwood. The title comes from a collage by the German artist John Heartfield.

The films comprise music videos, live performances, webcast footage from Radiohead&#x27;s studio and videos submitted by fans. It includes a performance of &quot;Morning Mr Magpie&quot; by Thom Yorke on acoustic guitar, a song later released on Radiohead&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;The King of Limbs&quot;. In the &quot;My Showbiz Life&quot; segments, Yorke and the guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien answer &quot;inane&quot; questions about their celebrity lives; Yorke&#x27;s voice is lowered with a pitch shifter, and O&#x27;Brien gives answers by &quot;braying like a donkey&quot;.

The episodes are hosted by the character Chieftain Mews, who has since appeared in Radiohead&#x27;s promotional material. The journalist Mac Randall described Mews as &quot;a 21st-century Max Headroom&quot; who &quot;intones non-sequiturs&quot;. Yorke credited his creation to Bran.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time&quot; as &quot;part scrapbook, part video demo reel ... an analogue lovefest of grainy images, strobing and hand-drawn animation, as the fans reflect the vertigo and anomie of the songs&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the films as &quot;impressionistic, surreal, and frequently inspired&quot;. 

==Release==
Radiohead planned to broadcast the material on their own television channel. The plans were cancelled, according to Yorke, due to &quot;money, cutbacks, too weird, might scare the children, staff layoffs, shareholders&quot;. They initially streamed the material on loop on a website, Radiohead Television, that debuted in May 2003 and ran until 2004.

From December 2004, Radiohead sold copies of the DVD through their website. Reviewing the DVD, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said few of the videos had &quot;multi-viewing appeal&quot;, but praised &quot;The Slave&quot;, &quot;The Homeland Hodown&quot; and the performance of &quot;Morning Mr Magpie&quot; as standouts. In January 2020, Radiohead made &quot;The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time&quot; available to stream free on their website.

<text>Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad (; 27 February 1919 – 5 March 1996) was a Bangladeshi politician. He was the Minister of Commerce in the third Mujib Rahman ministry under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and assumed the presidency of Bangladesh after the Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on August 15, 1975. He praised the assassins as &quot;sons of the sun&quot; and put cabinet ministers loyal to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in jail. He was himself deposed by another coup, less than three months later on November 3, 1975.

==Background==
Khandaker Mostaq Ahmad was born on 27 February 1918, into a Bengali Muslim family of Khandakers in the village of Doshpara in Daudkandi, Tipperah district (now Comilla District, Bangladesh). The family was a &quot;Pir&quot; family, his father &quot;Al-Hajj&quot; &quot;Hazrat&quot; Khandaker Kabiruddin Ahmed was considered to be a Muslim saint and was known widely as &quot;Pir Sahib,&quot; his mother was Begum Rabeya Khatun, a homemaker. He was a fourth-generation descendant of Khandaker Jalaluddin, an immigrant scholar of Arabic and Persian from Baghdad who was employed by the Nawabs.

Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed was the least controversial of the Awami League ministers during the time and generally considered to be the leader of the party&#x27;s right wing due to his Islamic leanings fostered by saintly background. He completed his Bachelor of Laws degree at the University of Dhaka and entered politics in 1942. He was one of the founder joint secretaries of the East Pakistan Awami Muslim League.

==Political career==
Ahmad was elected a member of the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly in 1954 as a candidate of the United Front. After the central government of Pakistan dissolved the United Front, Ahmad was jailed in 1954 along with other Bengali leaders. He was released in 1955 and elected the chief whip of the United Front parliamentary party.

In 1958, with the promulgation of martial law, he was arrested by the regime of Ayub Khan.

During the 6 Point Movement, Ahmad was again jailed in 1966. Following his release, Ahmad accompanied Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (then the most senior leader of the Awami League Party) to the all-parties conference called by Ayub Khan in Rawalpindi in 1969.

In 1970, he was elected a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan.

===Government of Bangladesh in exile===
At the onset of the Bangladesh War of Independence and Mujib&#x27;s arrest, Ahmad and other Awami League leaders gathered in Mujibnagar, Meherpur to form the Government of Bangladesh in exile. Syed Nazrul Islam served as the acting president while Mujib was declared president, Tajuddin Ahmad was appointed prime minister and Khondakar Mostaq Ahmed was made the foreign minister. In this capacity, Ahmad was to build international support for the cause of Bangladesh&#x27;s independence. But his role as the Foreign Minister became controversial as he wanted a peaceful solution, remaining within Pakistan in line with the Six Point Charter of his leader Sheikh Mujib. He was sidelined after his maneuverings came to light, left out of a visit to the United Nations General Assembly and dismissed by Prime Minister Ahmad shortly before the end of the provisional government, when the war had already ended. He was replaced by Abdus Samad Azad. Zafrullah Chowdhury alleges that Ahmad did not act alone in this regard and that Awami League leaders were involved.

After the liberation, Ahmad was appointed the Minister of Power, Irrigation and Flood Control in 1972 as part of the Second Sheikh Mujib cabinet. In 1973, he took charge of the Ministry of Commerce in the Third Sheikh Mujib cabinet. He was a member of the executive committee of Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BaKSAL) formed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, which made Bangladesh, a one-party system which was formed in 1975.

==Presidency==
Sheikh Mujib and all members of his family, except his two daughters, who were in West Germany at the time, were assassinated by a group of army personnel on 15 August.

Ahmad immediately took control of the government, proclaiming himself President. All three services chiefs were dismissed and replaced by next in line seniors. Major General Ziaur Rahman was appointed Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army, replacing K M Shafiullah. Air Vice Marshal A. K. Khandekar was replaced by AVM M G Ghulam Tawab. Mushtaq reportedly praised the plotters who killed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman calling them &quot;Shurjo Shontan&quot; (sons of the sun). Mushtaq Ahmad also ordered the imprisonment of leaders Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmad, A. H. M. Qamaruzzaman and Muhammad Mansur Ali. He replaced the national slogan of &quot;Joy Bangla&quot; with &quot;Bangladesh Zindabad&quot; slogan and changed the name &quot;Bangladesh Betar&quot; to &#x27;Radio Bangladesh&#x27;. He proclaimed the Indemnity Ordinance, which granted immunity from prosecution to the assassins of Mujib. Mujib&#x27;s daughters Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana were barred from returning to Bangladesh from abroad. BAKSAL and pro-Mujib political groups were dissolved.

On 3 November, in what became infamously known as the &quot;Jail Killing Day&quot;, the four imprisoned leaders Tajuddin Ahmad, Syed Nazrul Islam, A. H. M. Qamaruzzaman, and Muhammad Mansur Ali, who had refused to co-operate with Mostaq, were killed inside Dhaka Central Jail by a group of army officers on the instruction of President Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad. However, Mushtaq Ahmad was ousted from power on 6 November following a coup on 3 November led by Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf and Colonel Shafat Jamil among others.

==Later life and legacy==

Ahmad was imprisoned by Brigadier General Khaled Mosharraf and later by the Ziaur Rahman administration until 1978. Upon his release, he formed Democratic League and attempted to resuscitate his political career, but to no avail. He spent his last years in Dhaka and died on 5 March 1996.

Ahmad was named in the investigation of the murder of Sheikh Mujib launched in 1996 by his daughter Sheikh Hasina, who had just won the national elections to become Prime Minister of Bangladesh. Hasina blamed Ahmad for her father&#x27;s death. Due to his death, he was not charged or tried.

<text>The pygmy nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea) is a tiny songbird, about long and about 10 grams in weight.

== Description ==
Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

It ranges from southern British Columbia south through various discontinuous parts of the western U.S. (northwest U.S., Sierra Nevada range, southern Rockies, etc.), to central Mexico. It is usually found in pines (especially ponderosa pines), Douglas-firs, and other conifers. Pygmy nuthatches clamber acrobatically in the foliage of these trees, feeding on insects and seeds; less often they creep along limbs or the trunk like bigger nuthatches.

Pygmy nuthatches nest in cavities in dead stubs of conifers, lining the bottom of the cavity with pine-cone scales, plant down, and other soft plant and animal materials. They may fill cracks or crevices around the entrance with fur; the function of this behavior is unknown. The female lays 4–9 eggs, which are white with fine reddish-brown spotting. She does most of the incubation, which lasts about 16 days. The young leave the nest about 22 days after hatching.

This species is highly gregarious. A nesting pair may have other birds as helpers. Outside the breeding season, this bird wanders in noisy flocks. It also roosts communally; over 100 birds have been seen huddled in a single tree cavity.
All plumages are similar, with a warm gray cap, blue-gray upper-parts, and whitish underparts. The only feature not seen in the photograph is a whitish spot on the nape, particularly in worn plumage (summer). Vocalizations are highly varied chirps, peeps, and chattering.

This species is very similar to the brown-headed nuthatch of the southeastern U.S. Their ranges have no overlap.

The pygmy nuthatch features prominently in the climax of the 2000 film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, in which Cameron Diaz&#x27;s character, Natalie, discovers the location of the villains&#x27; fortress by identifying the call of the pygmy nuthatch, which she says only live in Carmel, California—though the bird shown is not a pygmy nuthatch, which in any case is found in a much wider range. (The Hollywood impostor is a Venezuelan troupial, &quot;Icterus icterus&quot; and the call is of a Fox sparrow)

<text>Unut, also known as Wenut or Wenet, was a prehistoric Ancient Egyptian hare and snake goddess of fertility and new birth.

Known as &quot;The swift one&quot;, the animal sacred to her was the hare, but originally, she had the form of a snake. She came from the fifteenth Upper Egyptian province, the Hare nome (called Wenet in Egyptian), and was worshipped with Thoth at its capital Hermopolis (in Egyptian: &quot;Wenu&quot;). Later she was depicted with a woman&#x27;s body and a hare&#x27;s head. She was taken into the cult of Horus and later of Ra.

== Etymology ==
Her name can be represented with five different hieroglyphs, but she rarely appears in literature and inscriptions. Her name was taken into the highest royal position just once in the long Egyptian history. Her male companion is Wenenu, who was sometimes regarded as a form of Osiris or Ra.

The only king bearing her name was Unas.

== Iconography ==

Unut is commonly portrayed as a woman with the head of the desert or Cape hare, &quot;Lepus capensis&quot; of Egypt. The Egyptians regarded the hare as an example of swiftness, alertness, and keen senses, but the animal’s form was also taken by certain underworld deities. Amulets made in the shape of the hare may have related to some aspect of the creature’s nature or may have been symbolic of this goddess.

<text>El Bolsón is a town in the southwest of Río Negro Province, Argentina, at the foot of the Piltriquitron Mountain. Due to a series of valleys through the mountains of Chile to the Pacific Ocean, El Bolsón has an unusually mild climate for its southern location.

El Bolsón area&#x27;s first non-indigenous inhabitants were Chilean farmers Lucas Cárdenas and Elcira Estrada, a couple who came in 1885 from San Pablo, near Osorno, and established themselves in the then known as &quot;Valle Nuevo&quot; (New Valley); in 2018, El Bolsón inaugurated the new Public Clock Square after the couple&#x27;s names. In the 1970s, hippies from Buenos Aires migrated to El Bolsón; some of them practised horticulture and made handcrafts.

El Bolsón has a tourism economy based on an outdoor artisan market, fly fishing, trekking, rafting, climbing, and other outdoor activities in the surrounding lakes and mountains. The nature tourism offers are complemented with the production of cheeses, smoked trout, special brew beer, regional chocolates and ice cream, as well as organic and wild-crafted jams and preserves, particularly elderberries.

==Communication==
El Bolsón is located approximately 120 km south of the major city of San Carlos de Bariloche and is served by El Bolsón Airport.

==Climate==
El Bolsón has a cool Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csb&quot;) owing to its rain shadow location. Winters are the coldest time of year with a July mean of with nighttime temperatures regularly falling below . During cold waves, temperatures can occasionally fall below . During the winter months, precipitation is abundant (mostly rainfall and occasionally snowfalls), resulting in most days being overcast, averaging 15–17 overcast days per month from May to August. Spring and fall are transition seasons featuring warmer temperatures than in winter. Summers are warmer and sunnier with temperatures during the day averaging in January and comparatively high diurnal ranges, with lows averaging . Frosts can even occur during the summer months. Owing to its location in a valley, wind speeds are lower ranging from a low of in May and June to a high of in January.

== History ==
There have been many different inhabitants in the Bolsón region. However, the first settlers of the region were the Tsonek. By custom they were hunters/gatherers and seasonally nomadic. It was normal for them to stay in the more sheltered regions of the forests and lakes during the winter and to hunt Guanaco more intensely during the summer and warm autumns. Very little is known about them before the sixteenth century, but through the process of Araucanization they were strongly influenced by the Mapuches. They were the most solid and cohesive culture around and were gaining ground toward eastern Patagonia, through both peaceful means and expansionist wars.

This town was not founded by any conqueror, Adelantado, explorer, or discoverer. This region simply served as a place of passage for the migrations of Tsonek communities, humans looking for game, and gatherers for a long time. Afterwards, it was purely Mapuche territory. Later, with the first inroads of the Europeans in the region, it also provided temporary shelter to those who were carrying cattle and herdsmen crossing the cordillera in an east-west direction, and vice versa, from one sea coast to another. This, as well as Argentina&#x27;s expansion into the region, resulted in frequent conflicts and disagreements with the Mapuche people.

The founding date of El Bolson is considered to be January 28, 1926. That day locals gathered at the home of Candido Azcona, resolving to create the first politically administrative organization in the region, and signing the charter, &quot;Commission for the Promotion of El Bolson&quot; . The elected members were: President Pedro Pascual Ponce: an Argentine born in the Province of San Luis. He was a teacher, informant &quot;ad honorem&quot; of the Ministry of Agriculture, rattle raiser, and took part in the Statistics and Census of the Nation of Argentina; Vice President Candido Azcona: a Spaniard from Basque Country, a farmer, and a merchant; Secretary Antonio Merino Rubio: a Spaniard from Malaga, a merchant, and a farmer; Treasurer José Ulieldin: a Lebanese merchant; pro-treasurer Miguel Anden: also a Lebanese merchant.

<text>The West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine (WVSOM) is a public medical school in Lewisburg, West Virginia. Founded in 1974, WVSOM is one of three medical schools in West Virginia and the sole institution that grants the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree. WVSOM currently has 778 students, and focuses on primary care and rural medicine.

== History ==
Purchasing a facility once used as Greenbrier Military School (1812–1972), the Greenbrier College of Osteopathic Medicine began as a private school with a class of 36 students in 1974. Two years later, in 1976, the board of governors of the school donated it to the state, which accepted establishing it as a state-funded public institution now named the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine. In 1978, WVSOM graduated its first class of 33 students. 
Extensive renovations started in 1992 and continue into the present time, with construction just completed on a new building that includes exam rooms and laboratory space. 
WVSOM has spent more than $38 million on construction and renovation projects while increasing from one building in 1974 to 12 campus facilities across its more than campus, all of this was accomplished while maintaining a debt free financial status.

On August 15, 2016, State Senator Craig Blair proposed privatizing the institution. Blair stated that the institution was diverting money from other functions and could thrive as a private institution freed from state bureaucratic regulations.

== Academics ==

WVSOM was founded on the principles of osteopathic medicine, a branch of medicine founded by frontiersman Andrew Taylor Still in the mid-to-late 19th century. The basic premise of osteopathic medicine is that a physician&#x27;s primary role is to facilitate the body&#x27;s inherent ability to heal itself. While originally designed as an improvement on the traditional medicine of 19th century America, osteopathic medicine became a reformation within the U.S. healthcare system while remaining distinct from other forms of medicine. 

In addition to a medical education, students at WVSOM also learn holistic techniques and are trained in Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM), manual-based therapies used to relieve pain, restore range of motion and foster the body&#x27;s own ability to heal itself.
Medical school at WVSOM is a four-year program, with two years of training located at the Lewisburg-based campus and the final two years taking place off-campus during clinical rotations.

== Demographics ==

WVSOM&#x27;s current enrollment stands at 778 students, with out-of-state students composing the majority (557 out of state :221 in state). The median age is 27, and there are students from 46 states currently attending WVSOM. The male female ratio is roughly equal with 384 females and 408 males. WVSOM maintains a diverse ethnic community on campus, with 161 minority students. AACOMAS reports that 5,298 students applied for admission into WVSOM&#x27;s most recent class (Class of 2020).

<doc id="1256547" wikidata="Q2975772" url="?curid=1256547" title="Tajuddin Ahmad">
<text>Tajuddin Ahmad (23 July 1925 – 3 November 1975) was a Bangladeshi politician. He led the 1st Government of Bangladesh as its prime minister during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, and is regarded as one of the most instrumental figures in the birth of Bangladesh.

Tajuddin began as a Muslim League youth worker in British India. He belonged to the Dhaka-based pro-democracy, secular Muslim League faction, which broke with the Muslim League&#x27;s reactionary party line after the partition of India and the birth of Pakistan. As a member of the short-lived youth organisation the Jubo League, he actively participated in the Language Movement in 1952. In 1953, he joined the Awami Muslim League (later the Awami League), a dissident offshoot of the Muslim League. The following year, he was elected a member of the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly. As a close confidante, he assisted Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in revitalising the Awami League into a secular political party during Ayub Khan&#x27;s regime in the late 1960s.

As the General Secretary of the Awami League from 1966, Tajuddin coordinated the party during the tumultuous late 1960s and early 1970s, suffering imprisonment on several occasions. He formulated the early draft of the historic six-points demand that would eventually lead to the birth of Bangladesh. He coordinated the Awami League&#x27;s election campaign for the 1970 Pakistani general election, in which the League gained a historic parliamentary majority. He also coordinated the non-cooperation movement of March 1971 precipitated by President Yahya Khan&#x27;s delay in transferring power to the elected legislators. Tajuddin was among Sheikh Mujib&#x27;s delegation in the Mujib-Yahya talks to settle the constitutional disputes between East and West Pakistan and transfer power to the elected National Assembly. Following the Pakistani army&#x27;s crackdown on the Bangladeshi population on 25 March 1971, Tajudddin escaped to India. In the absence of Sheikh Mujib, he initiated the set up of the Provisional Government of Bangladesh in 1971 and headed it, operating in exile in India, as its prime minister.

In independent Bangladesh, Tajuddin served as the Minister of Finance and Planning in Sheikh Mujib&#x27;s Cabinet from 1972 to 1974. He was also a member of the committee drafting the Constitution of Bangladesh. He resigned from the cabinet in 1974 to live a quiet life. Following Sheikh Mujib&#x27;s assassination in a coup d&#x27;état, Tajuddin was arrested and assassinated on 3 November 1975, along with three senior Awami League leaders in prison.

==Early life==

Tajuddin Ahmad Khan was born on 23 July 1925 at Dardaria, a village in the Dhaka district of the Bengal Presidency, in British India (now Gazipur District in Bangladesh), to Maulavi Muhammad Yasin Khan and Meherunnesa Khanam in a conservative, middle class Muslim family. He was the eldest of nine siblings—three brothers and six sisters.

The Bengal province, the eastern frontier of India, consisted of two conceptual regions: the &quot;West Bengal&quot; had a Hindu majority population and housed the provincial capital Kolkata, a thriving centre of trade and culture; &quot;East Bengal&quot;, Tajuddin&#x27;s home, was an impoverished hinterland of West Bengal, with a mostly poor Muslim peasant population. During Tajuddin&#x27;s formative years, British rule in India was nearing its end and Bengal was battered by famines, communal tensions and other problems. It was a hotbed of anti-British activism. Against this backdrop, his political activism began at a very early age, sometimes interrupting his studies. The anti-British activists of Bengal were his earliest political inspiration.

After attending a few schools in Gazipur, Tajuddin moved to Dhaka, his district headquarter and the principal town in East Bengal, for further studies. In Dhaka, he went to Saint Gregory&#x27;s High School, where he matriculated in 1944, securing 12th position in undivided Bengal. After matriculation, Tajuddin briefly lost interest in formal education because of his activism, pausing his studies for three years. At his mother&#x27;s insistence, he resumed his studies and was admitted to Dhaka College. There he attended classes irregularly because of his activism. As a result, he could not take the Intermediate of Arts examination from there; instead, he took it from a private college as an irregular student in 1948 and passed, securing fourth position in East Bengal. He obtained a BA with honours in Economics from the University of Dhaka. He also took his law degree from University of Dhaka.

Tajuddin lost his father at age twenty-two and took over the family responsibilities.

== Late British India ==

With British rule in India nearing its end and Hindu-Muslim tensions on the rise, in 1940 the political party All-India Muslim League brought about the Pakistan Movement, which demanded a separate state for the Muslims of India. Founded in 1906, in Dhaka, the Muslim League&#x27;s leadership came mostly from the feudal elites. Headquartered in Kolkata, the Bengal Provincial Muslim League, had had little grassroots organisation or activity in Bengal for a long time. Abul Hashim succeeded Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy as the general secretary of the Bengal Provincial Muslim League in 1943. Tajuddin, still a school student in Dhaka, joined the Muslim League in the same year. Hashim envisioned the creation of a &#x27;leftist&#x27; faction within the Muslim League against the prevailing leadership. He set out to reform the Muslim League organisation in Bengal. As part of this reform, in 1944, Hashim helped found the Muslim League party office in Dhaka at 150 Moghultuli Lane. The office became a haunt for the party&#x27;s progressive young dissidents, including Tajuddin, led by Kamruddin Ahmed, a schoolteacher and later a lawyer. As one of the four &#x27;full-time&#x27; party workers, Tajuddin helped Kamruddin publish the party newspaper.

Traditionally, the Muslim League in Dhaka and East Bengal at large was dominated by the Nawab family of Dhaka; many of its members held high offices in the party. Their residential palace, Ahsan Manzil, served as the de facto party headquarters. A rift developed between the Ahsan Manzil group and the 150 Moghultuli (Muslim League) group. Khwaja Nazimuddin and his brother Khwaja Shahabuddin led the Ahsan Manzil group; both held high offices in the provincial government and in the party. Their propaganda, aided by &quot;The Azad&quot; newspaper, the Muslim League&#x27;s mouthpiece, labelled Hashim and his followers as communists in disguise. Both groups contested elections in district party committees. In the 1944 Dhaka district committee elections, Tajuddin helped Kamruddin and the Moghultli group win a surprising victory against Shahabuddin&#x27;s intrigues.

The Pakistan Movement intensified after the Second World War and the Hindu-Muslim communal riots in Bengal in 1946. In August 1947, India was partitioned, and Pakistan was born as a result, causing mass migration and violence. Pakistan consisted of two geographically non-contiguous &quot;wings&quot;, thousands of miles apart. The far larger West Wing (current Pakistan), adjacent to the western border of India, comprised four provinces, and only East Bengal constituted the much smaller East Wing (current Bangladesh), adjacent to the eastern edge of India. Abul Hashim and Shaheed Suhrawardy opposed the partition of Bengal and did not migrate to Pakistan immediately. Even though it was leading the Pakistan cause, the Muslim League&#x27;s inadequacy to lead Pakistan as a nation was apparent to factions within it. A faction of the 150 Moghultuli Lane-based Muslim League skeptics, led by Kamruddin Ahmed, formed the Gano Azadi League, a civil rights organisation with a small following, in July 1947, a month before the partition of India. In contrast to the Muslim League, the organisation took progressive views on many issues, like the economy, culture, and education. Apart from Tajuddin, other founding members of the Gano Azadi League included Oli Ahad and Mohammad Toaha.

==East Pakistan==

===Early activism===

In the newly independent Pakistan, Tajuddin was a resident student of Fazlul Huq Muslim Hall in Dhaka University. The political atmosphere was grim in East Bengal. From the beginning, tensions developed between East and West Pakistan over various issues. The ruling Muslim League provincial government, led by the chief minister Khwaja Nazimuddin, mostly sided with West Pakistan on various issues. The university became an important centre of political activism; as usual Tajuddin became an enthusiastic participant in them. Many Kolkata-based pro-Hashim workers migrated to Dhaka after the Partition and joined the 150 Moghultuli group. Among them Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who had enrolled in Dhaka University and a few others, founded the East Pakistan Muslim Students&#x27; League (popularly called the Students&#x27; League) on 4 January 1948. Tajuddin joined the party as a founding member.

At the same time, as a frequenter of Dhaka&#x27;s political circles, Tajuddin was drawn increasingly towards the national political arena. He witnessed the marginalization of his 150 Moghultuli faction of the Muslim League at their leader Hashim and Suhrawardy&#x27;s absence in the political scene of East Bengal and the Ahsan Manzil group&#x27;s rise. In 1949, the 150 Moghultuli faction cut ties with the Muslim League and founded the Awami Muslim League (later the Awami League) with Maulana Bhashani, a Muslim cleric turned politician, as its president. Tajuddin admired Maulana Bhashani but showed little interest in his party initially. He and his disillusioned former Muslim League fellows kept meeting regularly at their haunts, speculating on the characteristics and the future of Pakistan, envisioning new political parties. Members of that group, notably Oli Ahad and Mohammad Toaha, founded the Jubo League, a youth organisation, at a youth convention that took place in March 1951. Tajuddin was elected a member of the Jubo League executive committee at its first annual council later that year.

East and West Pakistan came into a major conflict over the state language question within a month of Pakistan&#x27;s independence in 1947. West Pakistan leaders, including Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, advocated for Urdu as the only state language of multilingual Pakistan. In response to protests from various intellectual and political bodies of Bengali-speaking East Bengal, the state language decision was postponed for a while. However, as authorities continued efforts to push Urdu in various guises, the simmering dispute resurged in 1951. The ruling Muslim League provincial government, led by Nurul Amin, who succeeded Nazimuddin as the chief minister in 1948, again sided with West Pakistan. Tajuddin, as a Jubo League worker and an early participant of the movement, was elected a member of the University State Language Action Committee to advance Bengali as a state language, set up the in early 1951 by the students of the Dhaka University. The movement got its spark on 27 January 1952 as Prime Minister Khwaja Nazimudduin of Pakistan declared that, “the state language of Pakistan shall be Urdu and no other language.” On 21 February 1952, police opened fire on protest processions at various places, killing several protesters. Police raided the Jubo League&#x27;s office on 21 and 22 February; Tajuddin, who was residing in the office at that time, barely avoided arrest. As a result of the movement, the government conceded and granted Bengali status as a state language.

Despite its critical role in the Language Movement, the Jubo League was unsuccessful as a mainstream political party. Its members made their way into other established political parties. Many of them joined the Awami Muslim League, which after the Language Movement of 1952, emerged as East Pakistan&#x27;s most promising political party.

===Awami League===

Leaving his studies unfinished, Tajuddin left Dhaka in 1951 to work as a master at a school in Sreepur, close to his home in Gazipur. The school was in poor condition. During his visits to Dhaka at that time, besides taking part in political activism, he often lobbied for managing government aid for the school. After a year and three months, he returned to Dhaka and resumed his studies for his BA in economics in late 1952.

With the Provincial Assembly elections due next year, Tajuddin joined the Awami Muslim League in 1953, his Jubo League comrade Oli Ahad followed; the same year, he was elected as the general secretary of the Dhaka District chapter of the party. The Awami Muslim League participated in the election in a coalition with some other parties (called the United Front or Jukta Front), with their joint 21-point election manifesto, embodying many popular demands. Tajuddin, running on the Jukta Front ticket, was elected from his constituency, defeating the general secretary of the East Pakistan Muslim League, Fakir Abdul Mannan, by an overwhelming three to one proportion of the vote. At his twenty-nine, he became one of the youngest elected legislators of the assembly. The Jukta Front won a majority in the election, ending the Muslim League&#x27;s dominance in East Pakistan. However, within months of taking office, the central government dissolved the Jukta Front cabinet on the pretext of conspiring to secede by its chief minister A. K. Fazlul Huq. Tajuddin was arrested following the dismissal of the cabinet. He took the law examination from prison and earned a BA degree in Law. After his return from prison, he was elected as the social welfare and cultural secretary of Awami League in 1955.

Pakistan framed its Constitution in 1956, more than eight years after its independence, under which a general election was supposed to be held in early 1958. In 1958, however, a military junta, led by General Ayub Khan, the then minister of defence, seized power in a coup d&#x27;état. Ayub Khan declared himself president and chief martial law administrator. Four years later, in 1962, he instituted a new constitution, abrogating the old one, legitimising his junta&#x27;s rule. He also reformed the election process in his favour and brutally suppressed democratic activities. Tajuddin was arrested in 1958, just after Ayub Khan took over and was imprisoned for a year. Under Ayub&#x27;s rule, the suffering and deprivation in East Pakistan increased. West Pakistan dominated politics, administration, commerce, industry, and education; West Pakistan&#x27;s cities, like Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi, became centres of decision making, thrived as centres of trade, commerce and opportunity. The East Pakistan capital, Dhaka, was relegated to near obscurity. West Pakistani business persons dominated major East Pakistan businesses involved in jute and tea, for example.

Since the mid-1950s, the Awami Muslim League had been turning towards secularism; it dropped &#x27;Muslim&#x27; from its name in 1955, becoming known as the Awami League. It became vocal over the economic disparity between East and West Pakistan and began gaining popularity among the masses. In the Awami League, Tajuddin became close to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, one of the founders of the party. Since 1962, following party President Suhrawardy&#x27;s policy, the Awami League joined a front of democratic parties, called the National Democratic Front (NDF), against Ayub&#x27;s military regime and ceased functioning as an individual party. In 1964, after Suhrawardy&#x27;s death, Mujib, the general secretary of the Awami League, revived it as a party in the face of opposition by some senior leaders. Mujib&#x27;s influence in the Awami League only increased with Tajuddin as his &#x27;right-hand man&#x27;.

=== Six points and the 1969 uprising ===


The 1965 India-Pakistan War severely damaged the Ayub regime&#x27;s prestige. The opposition parties of Pakistan sought to exploit the situation by negotiating with the junta for more democratisation; they called for a conference in Lahore on 3 February 1966 and invited rising Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to win the league&#x27;s support. Meanwhile, just before the conference, President Ayub Khan visited Dhaka at the end of January 1966 and invited East Pakistani political leaders, including Sheikh Mujib, to a talk. Mujib wanted to seize the opportunity to put forward a few demands, highlighting East Pakistan&#x27;s interests to the president. Prior to the meeting, Tajuddin, a close confidante of Mujib by then, drafted the demands as a number of specific points, a precursor of the historic six-points demand. However, the demands did not make it to Ayub Khan on that occasion.

Sheikh Mujib and Tajuddin attended the Lahore Conference and put forward the revised version of those points as the six-point demand to the committee. They called for a new constitution, ensuring autonomy of provinces on key matters like monetary policy and defence instead of the prevalent absolute central governance. West Pakistani leaders present there received the six points with absolute disappointment; they viewed it as a secessionist proposal and refused to raise it in the conference.

In the party council of the Awami League on 14–15 March 1966, Sheikh Mujib was elected president and Tajuddin its general secretary. Promulgated by the Awami League, six points became the voice of the East Pakistani people, their charter of emancipation, while getting little support in West Pakistan. The military junta and the West Pakistani political parties viewed six points as a threat to Pakistan&#x27;s unity. The Ayub Administration was determined to suppress six points by any means. Awami League workers, already being brutally oppressed, came under even greater persecution. Tajuddin himself was arrested in 1966, as were many other senior Awami League leaders. In 1968, while Tajuddin was still in prison, Sheikh Mujib and some others, mostly East Pakistani military officials, were arrested on charges of high treason in the infamous Agartala Conspiracy Case.

In the face of the mass popular uprising of 1969, the Ayub regime began showing signs of compromise. On 1 February 1969, Ayub Khan announced a conference (popularly known as the Round Table Conference or RTC), in Rawalpindi, on 17 February 1969 with the opposition parties, including the Awami League. The Awami League declared the RTC would not gain credibility with their president, Mujib, imprisoned and refused to attend the conference. Ayub Khan rejected the opposition party forum&#x27;s plea for Mujib&#x27;s release citing legal difficulties. A legal battle ensued between the Awami League and the junta over Mujib&#x27;s release. Faced with popular pressure, the conference was postponed. On 17 February 1969, Tajuddin, just released from imprisonment, joined his two Awami League comrades, lawyers Kamal Hossain and Amir-ul Islam, who were already leading the legal proceedings, on their flight to Rawalpindi to negotiate Mujib&#x27;s release. Despite its initial objections, the Ayub government eventually conceded and agreed to release Mujib unconditionally so that he could attend the Round Table Conference. Finally, authorities released Sheikh Mujib, the unanimous leader of East Pakistan, from prison on 23 February 1969.

Tajuddin attended the Round Table Conference as part of the Awami League delegation led by Mujib. At this conference, the Awami League&#x27;s six points again came under strong opposition from the West Pakistani politicians. On 13 March, in the concluding session, Ayub Khan approved the federation proposal, however, he refused to comment on the autonomy of the provinces as the six points demanded, citing it as a matter that only elected legislators could decide. This effectively postponed it until a general election could take place.

President Ayub Khan resigned shortly after the conference, ending his 11-year rule; his commander-in-chief of the army, General Yahya Khan, who reportedly had been pulling the strings of the Round Table Conference from behind the scenes, took over as president. Yahya immediately abrogated the Constitution, imposed martial law, and promised a general election.

=== The 1970 general election ===
The 1970 general election, the first of its kind in Pakistan after years of military rule, was held on 7 December 1970. Of the 300 parliamentary seats of the National Assembly, East Pakistan and West Pakistan constituted 162 and 138 seats respectively. The Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, secured 160 out of 162 seats in East Pakistan and none in West Pakistan, still becoming the majority. Its closest contender, the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (PPP), led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, won 81 seats in West Pakistan and appointed no candidates in East Pakistan. Tajuddin ran and was elected from his constituency. With the elections concluded, the president was to inaugurate the National Assembly, and the elected legislators were to draft a new constitution. With the Awami League being in the majority in the assembly, there remained no obstacle to writing a constitution that complied with the six points demand. The Awami League quickly embarked on drafting a constitution proposal accordingly before the assembly is inaugurated. Sheikh Mujib and the senior Awami League leaders, including Tajuddin, met intensely with a group of legal and economic experts for about a month at a house on the banks of the river Buriganga on which Dhaka stands. From those discussions, in which Tajuddin played a key role, an unofficial constitution draft came out.

Meanwhile, the Awami League&#x27;s victory soared the anxiety among the West Pakistani opposition parties and the military junta alike. The PPP desired for a coalition between the two. After the election, on 20 December in Lahore the PPP leader Bhutto described Punjab and Sindh as &#x27;bastions of power in Pakistan&#x27;, two states where his party had won a sweeping majority. So, he asserted, no central government can function without his party&#x27;s support. To which Tajuddin, as the general secretary of the Awami League, replied in an official statement:

Unable to secure any compromise on six-points from the Awami League leadership in the previous months, on 1 March, Yahya Khan postponed the inaugural session of the National Assembly on 3 March, indefinitely. Sheikh Mujib immediately called for non-cooperation by his people, effectively taking control of East Pakistan. Mujib kept issuing regular directives to people and party workers. Tajuddin, Kamal Hossain, and Amir-ul Islam were put in charge of drafting the directives. Non-cooperation was an immediate success; people spontaneously defied a curfew imposed by the Army. On 7 March 1971, however, in a historical speech in front of a massive gathering, Sheikh Mujib called for an indefinite general strike, asking his people to be prepared for any emergency and issued an ultimatum to the military junta. On 15 March, Tajuddin, as the general secretary of Awami League, issued 35 directives to the people. On the same day, Yahya Khan arrived in Dhaka and a series of meetings took place between them until late March. Mujib assured Yahya that his party would not harm West Pakistan&#x27;s interests. He also pressed Yahya to withdraw the declaration of martial law immediately; Yahya refused, claiming legal difficulties with that. Mujib offered his assistants, Tajuddin and Kamal Hossain, to meet Khan&#x27;s legal experts to sort out the difficulties. Yahya accepted the offer, and Kamal Hossain and Tajuddin met his experts and made some progress. Troops and arms were being concentrated from West Pakistan. Mujib urged Yahya to stop the reinforcements, warning him of the consequences. The Awami League leadership expected that on 24 March final negotiations would take place, however, that day passed with no meeting. On 25 March they learned that Yahya&#x27;s delegation had secretly left Dhaka, leaving the discussions unfinished, killing any hope for a peaceful settlement.

==Bangladesh Liberation War==

Though Yahya Khan promised to resume talks on 25 March, everybody was apprehensive that an armed conflict was imminent. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman kept ordering his workers to escape to safety. Despite Tajuddin&#x27;s and others&#x27; repeated insistence, Mujib refused to escape until 25 March, fearing it would be used as a pretext to massacre innocent Pakistanis. Tajuddin also remained in Dhaka until 25 March, the night Yahya secretly left Dhaka and the Pakistan Army cracked down on the Bangladeshi population there, killing thousands of people. Like the entire nation, the Awami League&#x27;s leadership was taken by surprise; they scattered, each busy finding their own path to safety, and losing contact with one another for a few days. On the night of 25 March, Tajuddin and his trusted long-time comrade Amir-ul Islam left their homes and families and went into hiding. They secretly left Dhaka on 27 March for neighbouring India.

Tajuddin came to learn days later that Sheikh Mujib had been arrested on the night of 25 March. Before his arrest, he broadcast the independence of Bangladesh in a radio message.

After a perilous journey, mostly on foot through Kushtia and Chuadanga, Tajuddin and Amir-ul Islam crossed the Indian border on 30 March. At the border outpost the regional head of the Indian border security force (BSF), Golok Majumdar received them. Majudmar immediately transported them to Kolkata with him. There, on the night of 30 March and the next day, Tajuddin and Islam had discussions with BSF chief Rustamji, who had come from Delhi after learning of their arrival. On 1 April, Tajuddin and Islam, accompanied by Majumdar, left for Delhi aboard a military cargo plane.

=== Formation of Bangladesh Government in Exile ===

In Delhi, Tajuddin met with India&#x27;s Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, on 4 April. At their second meeting the following day, Gandhi informed him that Sheikh Mujib had been arrested and transported to Pakistan though Pakistan had not made this official yet. Asked about the Bangladesh government, he replied, having consulted with Amir-ul Islam the day before, that a provisional government had been formed with Sheikh Mujib as its president with the senior Awami League leaders who had attended the Mujib-Yahya talks as cabinet members. Tajuddin presented himself as the prime minister. Except for Sheikh Mujib, the whereabouts of the other members was unknown. Two crucial resolutions were reached in that meeting: India opened its borders to Bangladeshi refugees saving millions of lives in the upcoming days when Pakistani aggression reached outside major cities, and India allowed the Bangladesh Government to operate within Indian territory. The Indian government also promised to help the Bangladeshi liberation war by any means possible.

While Tajuddin was in Delhi, part of the Awami League leadership congregated in Kolkata. Many of them, notably the youth and student leaders, viewed Tajuddin&#x27;s meeting with the Indian prime minister as an outrageous act sidelining them. On returning to Kolkata, on 8 April, Tajuddin found and met the group of leaders, including A H M Qamaruzzaman, and informed them of the Delhi meeting&#x27;s outcomes, including the provisional government. Some of the leadership present there questioned Tajuddin&#x27;s legitimacy as prime minister. The youth leader Sheikh Mani rejected the idea of the cabinet outright. Instead, he proposed setting up a revolutionary council dedicated to conducting armed resistance only. Amir-ul Islam explained the inadequacy of the revolutionary council and the necessity of a legal government. After this, and following Qamaruzzaman&#x27;s mediation, most of the leadership at the meeting accepted Tajuddin&#x27;s proposal.

Tajuddin remained committed to the idea of a provisional government, believing only a legitimate government could muster the international support necessary for the liberation war. On 10 April, accompanied by Amir-ul Islam, Sheikh Mani and others, he boarded an old Dakota plane borrowed from the Indian government and set off in search of other cabinet members scattered around the borders. Flying at low altitudes, the plane stopped at various airstrips at the borders, most of them built by the British Army during the Second World War. After picking up cabinet members Muhammad Mansur Ali, Abdul Mannan, and Syed Nazrul Islam from various places on the way, on 11 April, the entourage arrived in Agartala, capital of the Indian state of Tripura, where many other Awami League leaders had taken refuge, including Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad and Colonel M A G Osmani.

Before reaching Agartala, during Tajuddin and his group&#x27;s stop in Shiliguri on 10 April, Golok Majumdar arranged the broadcast of Tajuddin&#x27;s first radio speech as the prime minister of Bangladesh from a clandestine radio station. The speech was recorded in Delhi from a draft prepared by Islam and Rehman Sobhan, an Awami League economist who also escaped Dhaka after the 25 March crackdown and made it to Delhi. In his speech, Tajuddin informed the people of Bangladesh of the formation of the government and the war&#x27;s progress. He praised the spontaneous armed resistances taking place at the various parts of the country and recognized their leaders. He also gave instructions to the people on the conduct of the war. Describing the Pakistani army&#x27;s onslaught, Tajuddin asked the international community to express solidarity with the freedom struggle of Bangladesh. The speech was broadcast again the next day on Akashvani Kolkata, the regional service of the Indian state radio, for a broader audience.

Reunited in Agartala, the Awami League leadership pondered the cabinet agenda and distributing cabinet offices. In the absence of President Sheikh Mujib, Syed Nazrul Islam served as acting president, Khondaker Mostaq took the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Qamarauzzaman was given the State Minister&#x27;s office, Mansur Ali the Finance Minister&#x27;s, and Colonel Osmani, a retired veteran of the Pakistan army turned Awami League politician, was appointed commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The entire cabinet returned to Kolkata on 13 April, set to take oath at some yet unoccupied place in Bangladesh.

The oath taking ceremony took place on 17 April 1971, at a village along the India-Bangladesh border, called Baidyanathtala, in Kushtia district (currently Meherpur district), on Bangladeshi soil. Professor Yusuf Ali read the proclamation of independence, drafted by Amir-ul Islam and reviewed by Subrata Roy Chowdhury, a lawyer at the Calcutta High Court, retroactively in effect from 10 April. Answering a journalist during the ceremony, Tajuddin named the place Mujibnagar, after Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Later the government-in-exile came to be popularly known as the Mujibnagar Government. Mujibnagar was abandoned quickly after the oath ceremony as participants feared a raid by Pakistani forces. The government settled in Kolkata, in exile, for the rest of the war—briefly at a house on Ballyganj Circular Road and then at 8 Theatre Road.

On 15 April, Tajuddin secretly met Hossain Ali, the deputy high commissioner of Pakistan, in Kolkata. Tajuddin persuaded Ali, along with his Bengali staff, to switch allegiance to the Bangladesh government the day after the cabinet took their oaths. As promised, Ali and 70 employees at the Deputy High Commission swore allegiance to the Bangladesh Government, turning the Pakistan High Commission on 9 Circus Avenue into the Bangladesh Mission in Kolkata for good. The mission came to house part of the government&#x27;s offices, most importantly, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

=== Organising the Liberation War ===

Starting in Dhaka and other major cities on 25 March, Pakistani forces occupied most of Bangladesh by late April, creating an influx of refugees into the bordering states of India, most notably in West Bengal and Tripura. The number of refugees would eventually reach ten million. As the war broke out, Bengali soldiers serving in various Pakistani battalions revolted and put up armed resistance against Pakistani forces all over Bangladesh. Rebel commanders of these battalions, unaware of the establishment of a provisional government, met along with Colonel M A G Osmani on 4 April. At that meeting, the Bangladesh Forces (BDF, popularly called &quot;Mukti Bahini&quot;) was formed, with Osmani as its commander-in-chief. Young people at various locations put up armed resistance. Unable to overcome the Pakistani forces&#x27; onslaught, owing mainly to lack of heavy arms and manpower, both soon retreated into Indian territory. As Pakistani forces spread around the country, thousands of youths from occupied Bangladesh crossed the border into India, seeking arms and training to join the fight against the Pakistani occupation force. Among the Tajuddin Government&#x27;s top priorities was coordinating those ongoing war efforts. In mid-July (10 to 15) the sector commanders of the BDF met at a conference at the Bangladesh Government&#x27;s headquarters on Theatre Road in Kolkata. The conference set a course for the conduct of the war in the coming months. The irregular guerrilla warriors were named &quot;Gono Bahini&quot; (popularly called &quot;Muktijoddha&quot; or &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot;) and the regular force was named &quot;Regular Force&quot; (popularly called &quot;Mukti Fouj&quot;).

Under Tajuddin&#x27;s premiership, many Bengali bureaucrats, diplomats and military officers serving Pakistan defected to the new Government of Bangladesh. The Government soon established a capable civil administration. On 27 July, Tajuddin, as the prime minister, issued an order (GA/810/345) that divided occupied Bangladesh into nine administrative zones, called Zonal Administrative Councils, for administrative convenience. On another order, issued on 18 September, the number was increased to eleven. Each zonal council was chaired by an elected legislator and several administrative officers were appointed by the Government under him. Amidst occasional pressures from within his party, Tajuddin played a key role in keeping the administration from becoming politicised.

Tajuddin employed a number of capable diplomats in his government. In early April, he commissioned economist Rehman Sobhan to stop the economic advisor to Pakistani president Yahya Khan, economist M M Ahmad, from acquiring fresh foreign aid for Pakistan and persuade Bangladeshi officials serving at Pakistani foreign missions to switch allegiance to Bangladesh.

Apart from organising the liberation war, over the nine months, Tajuddin had to deal with various problems originating from within his party. As Sheikh Mujib did not explicitly name his successor in his absence, a faction within the Awami League denounced his premiership from the beginning; they continued with their relentless efforts to discredit him. A lack of coordination among various government bodies arose on occasion.

The Chhatra League, the student wing of the Awami League, workers united under a separate force, initially called the Bangladesh Liberation Force (BLF) and later Mujib Bahini. Though initially commissioned by Osmani to recruit youths for the regular Bangladesh Forces, they eventually emerged as an independent armed force, under the auspices of the Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). Mujib Bahini clashed with the regular forces at various places. Sector Commanders of the regular forces and Osmani urged the government to bring them under the same command. Tajuddin himself expressed his concern about Mujib Bahini to Indian officials on occasion and to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at their meeting on 22 October. The situation, however, never improved.

By August, Minister of Foreign Affairs Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad and his cohorts at his ministry secretly established a liaison with the United States, a key ally of Pakistan, without the Government&#x27;s knowledge. With Sheikh Mujib on trial in Pakistan for high treason, the same group was also spreading the &#x27;either freedom or Mujib&#x27; doctrine. Indian intelligence agencies had discovered the fact just before Mostaq was scheduled to lead the Bangladesh delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Tajuddin removed Mostaq from the UN delegation and sacked him later in December, after the war.

In September, 40 members of the national and provincial assemblies of the South Zone, issued a statement expressing dissatisfaction on Tajuddin&#x27;s performance as prime minister and demanded his resignation from the cabinet and Awami League.

==Post-independence career==


After nine months of war, the Pakistani forces in Bangladesh surrendered at Dhaka on 16 December 1971. Tajuddin and his cabinet returned from Kolkata to Dhaka, now the capital of the newly independent Bangladesh, on 22 December 1971. In an address at the Dhaka airport that day and at the Dhaka Secretariate the following day, Tajuddin declared Bangladesh would be built upon the principles of socialism, democracy and secularism. On 23 December, recognising the sacrifice of the freedom fighters and their tremendous potential in building the newborn nation, the Tajuddin government declared that all enlisted and non-enlisted freedom fighters would be inducted into a National Militia. His administration quickly embarked on the immediate task of restoring law and order in the newly independent country.

Released from nine months of imprisonment in Pakistan, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman returned to Dhaka on 10 January 1972. Tajuddin and Mujib met privately on 11 January to decide the future leadership. As was the popular wish, Tajuddin happily agreed to transfer the prime minister&#x27;s office to Mujib. Though Mujib initially proposed a presidential government, at Tajuddin&#x27;s insistence, he accepted a parliamentary system. In the reformed cabinet, with Sheikh Mujib as prime minister, Tajuddin was put in charge of the Ministry of Finance and Planning. He was also appointed a member of the committee in charge of drafting the Constitution of Bangladesh.

As minister of finance, Tajuddin strongly resented foreign aid, particularly from the United States. He regarded the World Bank as an instrument of United States&#x27; domination. During World Bank president Robert McNamara&#x27;s visit to Bangladesh in 1972, Tajuddin&#x27;s response was cold, and their meeting ended bearing no fruit. According to the 1970 election manifesto spirit, in the first Bangladesh National Budget in 1972, Tajuddin declared the nationalisation of industries. This came under strong criticism. One of the major arguments against it was that nationalised industries would be unable to find enough skilled manpower to run them. Tajuddin and his fellow planning commission member Nurul Islam argued that if private enterprises can find manpower within the country the same must be the case for public enterprises and imposed their policies accordingly.

In the newly independent country, Mujib government struggled to address numerous problems. A dissident group of Chhatra League, Awami League&#x27;s student wing, emerged as a political party called Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) in late 1972. The ongoing economic crisis led to a famine in 1974. Anti-Awami League sentiment was on the rise.

In the new Awami League, and in the new cabinet, Tajuddin found himself increasingly cornered by rival factions. His was growing distant from Mujib; they differed on a number of issues: the National Militia scheme, consisting of freedom fighters, proposed by Tajuddin was abandoned; instead a paramilitary force called the Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini, dominated by the members of the Mujib Bahini, was formed. His frustration with government and his party was rising quickly; rumours of Tajuddin&#x27;s desire to resign from the cabinet were circulating. Sensing his frustration, the burgeoning, newly formed political party Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, desperately in search of a prominent face, approached him. He declined their offer. By September 1974, he had resolved to resign from cabinet after a month-long state tour. However, his intention to resign somehow reached the top of the government before he could act, and within days of his return from the tour in October, the prime minister ordered him to resign. On 26 October 1974, Tajuddin resigned from the cabinet. After his resignation, he remained largely inactive in politics.

From early 1975, Sheikh Mujib began a radical reform of the government and its administration. The Constitution was amended on 25 January 1975 to introduce a presidential form of government, declaring Mujib president. On 24 February 1975 President Mujib banned all political parties except one national party, called the Bangladesh Krishak Sromik Awami League (BAKSAL). Tajuddin declined to join it and fell out with Mujib.

Despite their political differences, Tajuddin remained loyal to Mujib and in July 1975, having heard rumours of plots against Mujib rushed to warn him. Mujib did not take the threat seriously.

==Death==
Capitalising on the growing unpopularity of the Sheikh Mujib government, a faction of the army staged a coup and killed Sheikh Mujib and a large part of his extended family on 15 August 1975. Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, who held office in Sheikh Mujib&#x27;s cabinet and was complicit in the conspiracy, immediately ascended to the presidency and imposed martial law.

Following these assassinations, Tajuddin was immediately placed under house arrest. On 22 August, he was arrested along with fellow Awami League leaders Syed Nazrul Islam, A H M Qamaruzzaman, and Muhammad Mansur Ali and imprisoned at the Dhaka Central Jail. On 3 November, amidst the chaos of a second coup staged by another faction of the army to overthrow the Mostaq regime, in what became infamously known as the &quot;Jail Killing Day&quot;, Tajuddin along with the other three imprisoned Awami League leaders was killed inside the jail by a group of army officers on the instruction of President Mostaq.

==Family==

On 26 April 1959, Tajuddin married Syeda Zohra Khatun (died 20 December 2013)) a daughter of a professor. They had four children, three daughters—Sharmin Ahmad (Reepi), Simeen Hussain Rimi, and Mahjabin Ahmad (Mimi), and one son, Tanjim Ahmad Sohel Taj.

Zohra was highly supportive of Tajuddin&#x27;s political activism but had no involvement in politics during his lifetime. After the assassinations of Sheikh Mujib and Tajuddin, she reorganised and led the Awami League from 1975 to 1981.

Tajuddin&#x27;s first daughter Sharmin Ahmad is an author and activist. His son Sohel Taj is a health and fitness activist and was minister of state for Home Affairs in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s cabinet in 2009. His second daughter Simeen Hussain was elected as a member of parliament for the Awami League in 2012.

==Historical evaluation==

Though Tajuddin and Sheikh Mujib were men of different dispositions, they developed a highly fruitful political rapport between themselves, which proved to be crucial for the birth of Bangladesh. Mujib&#x27;s biographer S A Karim contrasts between the two:

Mujib deferred to Tajuddin on many critical matters. As the PPP leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto called for a public debate on the six points, which never took place, Mujib nominated Tajuddin to defend his case. During the constitution drafting discussions, after the 1970 elections, Mujib considered sending Tajuddin or Syed Nazrul Islam to lead the central government if such necessity would arise.

Sheikh Mujib used to be the key figure in the Awami League; most major decisions came from him. His arrest in the beginning of the liberation war created a critical leadership void that put Tajuddin in a difficult position. However, Tajuddin quickly earned Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi and her officials&#x27; trust. P N Haksar, Gandhi&#x27;s secretary and adviser to her on Bangladesh affair in the early months of the war, explains the reason behind Indian government&#x27;s preference to Tajuddin over other Awami League leaders as prime minister:

India&#x27;s unwillingness in recognising Bangladesh as a state and no direct military intervention in the early months caused frustration among the Awami League leadership; Tajuddin appreciated the difficulties involved in the matter. D P Dhar, who later replaced Haksar, remarks that Tajuddin was the only capable leader to lead the war:

Tajuddin&#x27;s initiative for a joint front of political parties, training the leftist youths as guerrillas, refusals to politicise the administration made him unpopular in his party. His vocal stance against the Mujib Bahini made him unpopular among the youths.

The split between Mujib and Tajuddin started just after Mujib&#x27;s return to Bangladesh after independence. S A Karim maintains that the enemies Tajuddin had earned during the war caused his downfall. Tajuddin&#x27;s distance with Mujib frustrated him deeply. Economist Nurul Islam who had been the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission of Bangladesh with Tajuddin as its chairman describes their split as &#x27;a great tragedy and bode ill for the future&#x27;. He observes:

==Legacy==

After his rise to the senior ranks of the Awami League leadership, Tajuddin had been involved in most major party and government policy decisions. He was an important bridge between the political leadership and the technocrats supporting them. His prominent collaborators include economists Nurul Islam and Rehman Sobhan; lawyers Kamal Hossain and Amir-ul Islam; author Anisuzzaman and journalist Muyeedul Hasan.

Economist Nurul Islam said of him:

Economist professor Rehman Sobhan, recalls his experience of working with Tajuddin in drafting the constitution after the 1970 election:

Just after independence, &quot;Time&quot; described him:

Tajuddin used to be a regular and meticulous diarist. An active participant of the Bengali language movement, his diaries during the late 1940s and early 1950s chronicled first-hand accounts of the political activities and events of that time. Those diaries provided material for later researchers on the movement.

The documentary film &quot;Tajuddin Ahmad: An Unsung Hero&quot;, directed by Tanvir Mokammel, released on 25 March 2007, features Tajuddin&#x27;s life and work.

Shahid Tajuddin Ahmad Medical College in Gazipur is named after Tajuddin.

<text>Benjamin Elijah Mays (August 1, 1894 – March 28, 1984) was an American Baptist minister and American rights leader who is credited with laying the intellectual foundations of the American civil rights movement. Mays taught and mentored many influential activists, including Martin Luther King Jr, Julian Bond, Maynard Jackson, and Donn Clendenon, among others. His rhetoric and intellectual pursuits focused on Black self-determination. Mays&#x27; commitment to social justice through nonviolence and civil resistance were cultivated from his youth through the lessons imbibed from his parents and eldest sister. The peak of his public influence coincided with his nearly three-decade tenure as the sixth president of Morehouse College, a historically black institution of higher learning, in Atlanta, Georgia. 

Mays was born in the Jim Crow South on a repurposed cotton plantation to freed sharecroppers. He traveled North to attend Bates College and the University of Chicago from where he began his career in activism as a pastor in Georgia&#x27;s Shiloh Baptist Church. After a brief career as a professor, he was appointed the founding Dean of the School of Religion at Howard University in 1934 which elevated him to national prominence as a proponent of the New Negro movement. Six years later, Mays was tapped to lead Morehouse out of its financial insecurity. Over his tenure from 1940 to 1967, the college&#x27;s financial endowment doubled, enrollment quadrupled, and it became academically competitive. By the 1960s, Mays established the college as a feeder school for &quot;African-American firsts&quot; in the United States.

Due to the college&#x27;s small student body, Mays personally mentored many students, most notably King; the two first met in 1944. King was known as Mays&#x27; &quot;spiritual son&quot; and Mays his &quot;intellectual father&quot;. After King&#x27;s &quot;I Have A Dream&quot; speech at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, Mays gave the benediction. Five years later, upon King&#x27;s assassination and death, Mays delivered the eulogy where he described King in his &quot;No Man is Ahead of His Time&quot; speech. Mays stepped down from the Morehouse presidency in 1967 continuing to work as a leader in the African American community through national social tours. He presided over the Atlanta Board of Education from 1969 to 1978, where he initiated the racial desegregation of Atlanta.

Mays&#x27; contributions to the civil rights movement have had him credited as the &quot;movement&#x27;s intellectual conscience&quot; or alternatively the &quot;Dean [or Schoolmaster] of the Movement&quot;. Historian Lawrence Carter described Mays as &quot;one of the most significant figures in American history&quot;. Memorials include hundreds of streets, buildings, statues, awards, scholarships, grants, and fellowships named in his honor. Numerous efforts have been brought forward to posthumously award Mays the Presidential Medal of Freedom as well as feature him on a U.S. postage stamp. Mays has, since 1995, been entombed on the campus of Morehouse, with his wife, Sadie Gray, after an initial burial in Augusta.
== Early life ==

Benjamin Elijah Mays was born on August 1, 1894, in Epworth, South Carolina, in the small county of Greenwood, South Carolina, the youngest of eight children. His mother, Louvenia Carter Mays, and father, Hezekiah Mays, were born into slavery on Virginia and South Carolina plantations, respectively. Both were freed in their later lives with the passage of the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Mays&#x27; father often hit him, his siblings and Louvenia growing up, expressing anger about how he was treated by his master. The &quot;Mays&quot; family name was derived from their slaver and owner&#x27;s name, Henry Hazel Mays; he owned 14 slaves in the same area. Hezekiah worked as a cotton sharecropper to generate income for his family.

Mays was told to be cautious of white people and exhibit black pride whenever possible growing up. Mays&#x27; older sister, Susie, began to teach him how to read before his formal schooling commenced, which gave him a year&#x27;s growth in reading compared to the other students in his primary schools. School officials cited him as &quot;destined for greatness&quot;. Growing up, he went by the nickname &quot;Bennie&quot; and was inspired by Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, and Thomas E. Miller. The Bible was influential to young Mays because he could see his name (of Biblical origins) mentioned frequently, instilling a feeling of empowerment within. During this time, Benjamin Tillman rose to power in South Carolina which saw to the redoubling of lynching and segregation in Mays&#x27; neighborhood. Throughout his tenure as governor, 18 black men were lynched and dozens were hurt in the 1876 shoot-off. On November 8, 1898, members of the Phoenix Riot–a white supremacist mob–rode up on horses to the Mays household, a repurposed cotton plantation. They drew their guns at Mays&#x27; father and told him to remove his hat and bow down to them. The event would stay with Mays throughout his life. A year later, white mobs and Ku Klux Klan members searched his house in search of relatives after local newspapers announced that cotton prices had plummeted.

=== Early education ===
In 1911, he was enrolled at the Brick House School in Epworth, a Baptist-sponsored He also was enrolled in Bethany Industrial Graded School in McCormick, South Carolina founded by his church pastor Rev. James Foster Marshall. He then transferred to the High School Department of South Carolina State College in Orangeburg. He graduated in 1916, aged 22 as its valedictorian. In high school, teachers often let Mays instruct parts of the mathematics curriculum to students in exchange for extra credit. He won awards for debate and mathematics. A teacher at the school had told Mays to seek graduate school at the University of Chicago as he thought the school would best nurture Mays&#x27; intellect. However, before attending graduate school Mays needed to seek an undergraduate education. His relatives and teachers forced him to attend a Baptist university–the Virginia Union University. He grew weary of the violence against blacks in Virginia so he sought the guidance of his academic advisors at Virginia Union. They advised him to look into schools in the North as they were typically seen as more prestigious, challenging, and prominent than those of the South.

Four professors at the university had attended Bates College in Lewiston, Maine and urged Mays to apply. However, its exacting standards prohibited him from attending. After a year more in Richmond, Mays elevated his grades to the top of his class and wrote personally to Bates president George Colby Chase. Chase granted him a full financial aid package and boarding upon hearing his story and reviewing his academic background. Virginia Union&#x27;s president warned him that studies at Bates would be &quot;too hard for a colored boy&quot; and that he should stay in Virginia. Mays ignored his warnings and enrolled in 1917, aged 23. While at Bates he felt pressure to compete with &quot;Yankees at the Yankee level&quot; which drove him to dedicate him to his studies. He would write in a diary: &quot;Yankee superiority was the gauntlet thrown down. I had to pick it up.&quot; Working to midnight weekly and arising at 4 AM, Mays excelled at Greek, mathematics, and speech. Although he would experience little racism in college, upon seeing &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; in a local cinema, the crowd cheered for the white slaver which frightened Mays. In college, he was captain of the debate team, played on the football team and served as the Class Day Speaker. He graduated with departmental honors with a B.A. in 1920. Contrary to popular writing and official college records, Mays never received Phi Beta Kappa; his attendance of a &quot;high school school from the South&quot; disqualified him.

=== Marriages ===
Shortly after graduation, he married his first wife, Ellen Edith Harvin, in August 1920 in Newport News, Virginia. The two met when Mays was still in South Carolina and wrote to each other frequently. She was a home economics teacher at a local college before she died after a brief illness two years after they married at age 28. He met his second wife, Sadie Gray, while working at South Carolina State College. After months of courtship, they married on August 9, 1926. Mays kept private the details of his relationship with his second wife; he burned the majority of letters and correspondence between them.

== Early academic career ==

On January 3, 1921, he then entered the University of Chicago as a graduate student, earning an M.A. in 1925. Early on in his academic career he decided to join Omega Psi Phi, a national fraternity for colored men. This organization was known for pooling resources and information among its members so Mays viewed it with great interest. Mays viewed it as &quot;a mountain top from which he could see above and beyond&quot;. In 1924, upon hearing news that there was to be a fraternity meeting in St. Louis, Missouri, Mays traveled by train. However, his decision to travel first class from Birmingham to St. Louis was indirectly against the Jim Crow laws. The ticket salesman only sold Mays a ticket when he lied about who it was for. While riding to St. Louis, the Pullman warned Mays that he was risking his life by sitting in first class and that he should get off at the next stop. Shortly after, three white men, guns drawn, escorted Mays into a car in the back known as the &quot;Jim Crow car&quot;. He eventually made it to the Omega Psi Phi meeting, where he spoke of his experience.

To finance his time in university, Mays worked as a Pullman Porter, a railway assistant. Much of the money he had earned growing up was spent financing his time at Bates, on Christmas Day 1921, Mays held only 45 dollars (). Mays began labor organizing to increase his wage, which was seen negatively by the Porter managers. Although he legally established a labor group for Pullman Porters, he was fired from his job for &quot;attracting too much attention to labor rights.&quot; His time at the University of Chicago was marked by segregation. He was asked to sit at the colored area in the dining halls and was only allowed to use certain rooms for reading. Mays tolerated the segregation with the mindset that he was &quot;only there to get a degree, to convince another brilliant set of Yankees that he could do their work.&quot; Although he was licensed to preach in 1919, he was officially ordained a Baptist minister in 1921. During this time he encountered John Hope, the current president of Morehouse College. Hope spoke to Mays about the lack of &quot;a fine education for the colored in Atlanta&quot;. Mays traveled to Atlanta in 1921 and served as a pastor at the Shiloh Baptist Church until 1923. In March 1925, Mays was award an M.A. in religious studies from the university. Upon receiving his master&#x27;s degree, he wrote to the pastorate with his intention of resigning to pursue a doctorate in the coming years. However, due to his financial status, he took up a teaching position instructing English at South Carolina State College from 1925 to 1926. Mays left his teaching position after routinely clashing with other faculty over grade inflation and academic standards.

In 1926, he moved to Tampa, Florida, to serve as the director of the Tampa Urban League. While there, the Urban League produced what became known as the &quot;Mays Report&quot;, which detailed the growth of Tampa&#x27;s African-American communities and the difficulties they experienced living in segregated neighborhoods. Though he did not stay in the area for long, Mays made enough of an impact on the nascent push for civil rights in the region that he has been honored with a bust on the Tampa Riverwalk Historical Monument Trail. From 1928 to 1930, he lived in Atlanta and served as the national student secretary of the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA). A couple of months later, he was asked to serve as the director of Study of Black Churches in the United States by the Institute of Social and Religious Research of New York. In 1932, Mays returned to the University of Chicago with the intent of completing a Ph.D. in line with what was asked by the Institute of Social and Religious Research of New York. After some deliberation between fields of studies he could pursue a doctorate in, he eventually decided to study religion and not mathematics or philosophy. Mays also worked as a student assistant to Dr. Lacey Kirk Williams, pastor of Olivet Baptist Church in Chicago and President of the National Baptist Convention. In 1933, he wrote his first book with Joseph Nicholson, &quot;The Negro&#x27;s Church&quot;. It was the first sociological study of the black church in the United States and was submitted to the university faculty as his dissertation in 1935. Historian John Herbert Roper estimates that Mays was one of 20 African Americans to earn a doctorate during that year.

=== Howard University ===

Shortly after receiving his doctorate, he was called by the presidents of multiple universities to lead their religion departments. Mays chose to accept a position at Howard University in Washington as its dean of religious studies. He was instructed to build up the department and establish a reputation for well-trained ministers. Mays first renovated its library and secured loans from the federal government to expand it. His second objective was to separate the federally-funded portions of Howard University from the new school of religion. At the time, the university was partially funded by the U.S. Department of the Interior which prohibited funding to religious enterprises. After he successfully removed the School of Religion from the auspices of the federal government he was tasked with securing funding from wealthy donors from the North.

Mays secured a multi-million dollar package from donors by 1930, and was averaging yearly contributions of $750,000 during the Great Depression. The expanding Department of the Interior under Franklin D. Roosevelt, coupled with Mays&#x27; fundraising led to unprecedented growth at the university. Salaries for professors increased, new dorms were built and refurbished, the library Mays had been developing was completed, and new lecture halls were established. In 1938, he published his second book, &quot;The Negro&#x27;s God as Reflected in His Literature&quot;. In 1939, he secured a large collection of theology books for his new library which prompted the American Association of Theological Schools to accredit the new School of Religion. During this time Mays developed a reputation for exacting standards and elitism. He was a vocal opponent of the notion that black men are inherently more violent than their white counterparts in universities. He was a vocal proponent of the New Negro movement and frequently lectured about its foundlings and applications.

In January 1940, Mays was secretly approached by John Hervey Wheeler, a trustee of Morehouse College, to see if he was interested in an upcoming search for the college&#x27;s next president. Wheeler told Mays that the school had a tough time with getting tuition payments out of the students, growing their endowment, and establishing national prominence. Mays expressed interest in the position but Wheeler cautioned him about the odds of him actually being offered the job. On March 10, 1940, Mays was offered the presidency of Morehouse by its trustees; he moved to Atlanta shortly after. When Mays left Howard University, he was honored with the renaming of the newly constructed home of the divinity school to &quot;Benjamin Mays Hall&quot;.

==== Meeting with Gandhi ====
In 1936–37, Mays traveled to Mysore, India, where, at the urging of Howard Thurman, a fellow professor at Howard, he spoke at some length with Mahatma Gandhi. The two spoke for an hour and a half about the realities and powers of militant pacifism which he used to shape his civil rights ideology and practice. Mays asked Gandhi about the influence nonviolence had in his life and what his personal thoughts were on the caste system in India. Gandhi told Mays that there was never an instance where violence was acceptable especially that which was undertaken in retaliation. He was told that &quot;one must pay the price for protest, even with one&#x27;s life&quot;. In response to the caste system. Gandhi believed that there those with darker skin were not inherently untouchable but labeled it a &quot;necessary economic injustice&quot;.

== Morehouse College, 1940–1967 ==

=== Early years ===
Mays was offered the presidency on March 10 and inaugurated the sixth president on August 1, 1940. Upon his assumption of the presidency, the school was in severe financial distress. In his first speech to an incoming freshman class in 1940, he said, &quot;If Morehouse is to continue to be great; it must continue to produce outstanding personalities.&quot; Mays set out to improve the training of Morehouse men, increase enrollment, grow its endowment, and collect tuition payments.

Many associated with the college referenced him as a &quot;builder of men&quot;. To improve the training of Morehouse men, Mays set out to advance a new curriculum based on the New Negro movement. He specifically wished to increase the training of black physicians, ministers and lawyers. Although Morehouse College was not a medical, law, or ministry school, it was a feeder institution into them so Mays took the preparation of his students into these schools seriously.

=== Financial planning ===
During his first three months nothing was planned to be or currently being constructed on campus. Mays had inherited &quot;mountains of uncollected student bills&quot; which served as a threat to the liquidity of the college. In 1933, Morehouse was doing so poorly financially that it had allowed Atlanta University to take over its financial direction and budget. He earned a reputation for being a penny-pincher and demanded tuition fees on time, which earned him the nickname &quot;Buck Bennie;&quot; the student newspaper occasionally ran headlines such as &quot;Buck Bennie Rides Again&quot;, during the first couple of years of his Morehouse presidency. However, he often helped students pay their bills by offering work or finding it around campus. He would write to the employers of the college&#x27;s graduates to ask them how the recent grads were doing as a way to measure the Morehouse education. Within two years of his presidency, Mays was so successful that he was able to regain control of Morehouse&#x27;s finances.

=== Effects of World War II ===
Soon after primary advancements were made with the college, World War II broke out and many students were drafted for military service. The Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Morehouse approached Mays and requested the school be shut down for the remainder of the war, which prompted Mays to lash out and reject his proposition publicly. Mays counter-proposal was to open the school to younger students who were ineligible to be drafted. He moved to improve the academic quality of the students by lowering admissions rates, and reforming the academic platform. College faculty were often encouraged to befriend students and provided them with guidance in a tumultuous social scene at the time.

=== Recognition ===
The introduction to his speech compilation at Morehouse notes him with the following:

In physical stature Mays stood six feet tall, but appeared taller because of his erect posture--a habit he developed during his youth to walk around with dignity and pride; he weighed approximately 180 pounds and had a full head of iron-grey air with a contrasting dark complexion. His distinctive physical appearance commented his towering intellectual stature. When Mays walked into a room, eyes were likely to focus in his direction. His mere physical presence attracted attention. 

He received an honorary doctorate and the &quot;Alumnus of the Year&quot; Award from Bates College in 1947 and the University of Chicago in 1949, respectively. Although he was a college president, he was not allowed to vote in the 1950s until he was 52 years old. &quot;Pulpit&quot;, a magazine focusing on black religious preachers, ranked him among the top 20 preachers in America in 1954. The same year he was one of the &quot;Top Ten Most Powerful Negros&quot; in the nation according to black magazine, &quot;Our World.&quot;

=== Jackie Robinson ===
In 1966, as president, Mays was invited to sit at an Atlanta Braves baseball game as a guest-of-honor by Jackie Robinson when the sports franchise moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta. Robinson invited Mays because of his efforts to integrate the baseball team in Atlanta. Robinson said of Mays: &quot;When we first moved here it was the first team of major league caliber to ever move this far south to play baseball. And of course [Mays] was one of the guys, one of the persons really that made things a lot easier for myself and some of the other black ball players.&quot;

=== Roles in the White House ===
As president he was in great demand as a public speaker. He met hundreds of national and international leaders and served as a trusted advisor to Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Carter. He was appointed by President Truman to the Mid-Century White House Conference on Children and Youth. When Pope John XXIII died in 1963, President Kennedy sent Mays and his Vice President to represent the United States at the funeral in Rome, Italy. During the Kennedy administration, southern members of the Senate blocked Mays&#x27; appointment to the United States Civil Rights Commission by accusing him of being a Communist. Mays denied the charges. His relationship with President Jimmy Carter was marked with &quot;warmth&quot; and &quot;hospitality&quot;. Carter visited Mays&#x27; home in Atlanta, and Mays in turn campaigned for Carter during his 1976 and 1980 presidential runs. Carter wrote to Mays on a monthly basis during his presidency asking him about &quot;human rights, international affairs, and discrimination.&quot;

=== Final years ===
Mays wanted to hire more teachers, and to pay those teachers a better salary. To do that, Mays sought to be more strict in the collection of student fees, and wanted to increase Morehouse&#x27;s endowment from $1,114,000. He more than quadrupled the endowment that he inherited by the end of his 27-year tenure. Over Mays&#x27; twenty-seven years leading Morehouse, the enrollment increased 169%, from 238 to almost a thousand students and furthered the motivation for graduates to pursue graduate studies.

== Connection to Martin Luther King Jr. ==

Mays first became associated with Martin Luther King Jr. during his time as a student at Morehouse College. While King was a student from 1944 to 1948 he often went to Morehouse&#x27;s chapel to hear Mays preach. After the sermons, King would run up to Mays and engage with him about the ideas he presented often following him into his office, hours after the sermon ended. He was also a friend of Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s father, Martin Luther King Sr. and often participated with him in religious organizations in Atlanta. Mays dined at the King&#x27;s homes from time to time and spoke with the young Martin Luther King Jr. about his career prospects and ambitions. His mother, Alberta Williams King said Mays was a &quot;great influence on Martin Luther King Jr.,&quot; &quot;[an] example of what kind of minister Martin could become,&quot; and &quot;possessor of great moral principles&quot;.

While King was only in his 20s, Mays helped him assume the responsibility of his actions in the civil rights rallies in which he participated. King needed Mays &quot;for spiritual support as he faced the burden of being perceived as the personification of black America&#x27;s hopes and dreams, it was Mays who held the job as King&#x27;s consigliere over the next fourteen years as the death threats against him grew more ominous and the public battles more dangerous.&quot;

After King gained national attention as a consequence of his 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, he began to refer to Mays as his &quot;spiritual and intellectual mentor&quot;, which enhanced the friendship they had and prompted Mays to be more involved with King&#x27;s civil rights endeavors. Mays revered him as his &quot;spiritual son&quot;. Mays gave the benediction at the close of the official program of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where King delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech in 1963.

=== &quot;No man is ahead of his time&quot; speech ===

The two developed a close relationship that continued until King&#x27;s assassination by James Earl Ray on April 4, 1968. King and Mays promised each other that whoever outlived the other would deliver the eulogy at the other&#x27;s funeral.

On April 9, 1968, Mays delivered a eulogy that would later be known as the &quot;No Man is Ahead of His Time&quot; speech. He noted King&#x27;s time in history to an estimated 150,000 mourners by stating in his most famous passage:

The speech was well received by the attendants of the funeral and the American public. It was later hailed as &quot;a masterpiece of twentieth century oratory&quot;. After the death of King, Mays drew controversy when his sermon at the Ebenezer Baptist Church urged an audience of mostly white people &quot;not to dishonor [King&#x27;s] name by trying to solve our problems through rioting in the streets. If they could turn their sorrow into hope for the future and use their outrage to invigorate a peaceful climb to the mountaintop, Martin Luther King Jr. will have died a redemptive death from which all mankind will benefit.&quot;

== After Morehouse, 1967–1981 ==

=== Social tours and advocacy ===

Mays began teaching again, and served as a private advisor to the president of Michigan State University and went on to publish &quot;Disturbed About Man&quot;, a collection of his sermons at Morehouse College. His publications described his early life in South Carolina and the racial tensions he had to overcome. During this time he began to give speeches and commencement addresses at various institutions to spread both religious and racial tolerance. He ended his social tours in the early 1980s, giving a total of 250 commencement addresses at colleges, universities, and schools. In 1978, the U.S. Department of Education granted him the Distinguished Educator Award and the South Carolina State House hung a commissioned portrait of him in its chamber. These awards from South Carolina were deeply appreciated by Mays as he left the state in fear of his life and this he loved. During the social transformation of the South in the 1970s, Mays&#x27; legacy in his birthplace was solidified and he took on the title of &quot;native son&quot;.

=== Atlanta board presidency ===
At age seventy-five, Mays was elected president of the Atlanta Public Schools Board of Education, where he supervised the peaceful desegregation of Atlanta&#x27;s public schools as a consequence of the 1970 federal court order. Members of the board argued that since the bussing was not a part of their system they did not have to create one for desegregation; however, the idea was shot down by Mays, who cited the &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; Supreme Court decision. It was during this time that Mays ordered the city to create bus routes to cater to African-American neighborhoods. The board did not support the decision and asked Georgia&#x27;s Attorney General, Arthur K. Bolton, for a review of the case. Bolton brought the city government together with the board and with Mays created what was known as the Atlanta Compromise Plan.

His &quot;commanding and demanding personality&quot; was largely credited for the exponential levels of desegregation in Atlanta. The Atlanta Compromise Plan prompted Mays to advocate for the administration of the plan to be &quot;colorless&quot;, that is to say, black and white students were transported on the same routes, in the same buses. This was named the &quot;Majority to Minority&quot; volunteer plan, better known as the &quot;M to M&quot; plan. The plan also allowed each student whose race was in the majority at a school to transfer to a school where they would be in the minority race; this was advantageous to the black populace of Atlanta. The program was later known as the &quot;Volunteer Transfer Program&quot; or VTP, and was ministered by the federal courts and the board. On July 28, 1974, Mays signed the alignment order declaring that the Atlanta School System was unitary.

On July 1, 1973, Mays appointed Alonzo Crim as the first African-American superintendent of schools, which was met with backlash from the other board members and city officials. He used his power and influence in Atlanta to shield Crim from the criticism and allowed him the opportunity to run the school system. During the later part of his tenure he greatly expanded the jurisdiction of the board, and upon his retirement in 1981 Mays was honored by the naming of a street. Near the end of his tenure, the board voted to name a newly constructed school after Mays; Mays High School was constructed on February 10, 1985, and was open to students of all races. He retired from the board in 1981. The Atlanta Board of Education had a rule against naming buildings after people unless they had been deceased for two years; they waived it for Mays; he visited the school frequently when it was being built. He is widely credited as the most influential figure in the desegregation of Atlanta, Georgia.

== Death and legacy ==

Benjamin Mays died on March 28, 1984, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was initially buried at South-View Cemetery, but in May 1995 his body was entombed on the campus of Morehouse College along with his wife Sadie. Morehouse College established the Benjamin E. Mays Scholarship shortly after his death.

Boston University professor Lawrence Carter described Mays as &quot;one of the most significant figures in American history.&quot; Andrew Young said of Mays: &quot;if there hadn&#x27;t a Benjamin Mays there would not have been a Martin Luther King Jr. He was very much a product of Dr. Mays religious thinking.&quot; He was known to Dillard University president Samuel DuBois Cook as &quot;[one of the] great architects of the civil rights movement. Not only in training individuals but in writing his books, leadership in churches, as a pastor, college president. He set the standard. And he was uncompromising.&quot; In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Benjamin Mays on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.

=== Sites and honors ===
In his home state of South Carolina a portrait of Mayes, painted by artist Larry Francis Lebby, was placed in the gallery of the South Carolina House chambers in 1981. Mayes was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame in 1984. His childhood home was relocated from Epworth to Greenwood, SC and is listed as a State Historic Site by the government of South Carolina, being referred to as an &quot;education icon&quot; by the South Carolina Radio Network in 2011. Upon his death Mays was designated Phi Beta Kappa, Delta Sigma Rho, Delta Theta Chi, Omega Psi Phi.

Nationally, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1982. He was elected to the Schomburg Honor Roll of Race Relations along with &quot;only a dozen major leaders to be so honored.&quot; In 2011, Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, introduced the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship at Williams College. The National School Boards Association created the Benjamin Elijah Mays Lifetime Achievement Award for &quot;an individual who—during his or her lifetime—has demonstrated a longstanding commitment to the educational needs of urban school children through his or her service as a local school board member.&quot; Due to his stature in academia he was frequently awarded honorary degrees from universities. He was awarded 40 of them during his lifetime and as of February 2018, he has received 56 honorary degrees.

Bates College&#x27;s highest alumni distinction is known as the Benjamin E. Mays Medal and is reserved for &quot;the alumna or alumnus who has performed distinguished service to the larger (worldwide) community and been deemed a graduate of outstanding accomplishment.&quot; The inaugural winner was Mays himself. The college established the Benjamin E. Mays Distinguished Professorship in 1985.

Mays has been the subject or inspiration of memorials, and the eponym of hundreds of buildings, schools, streets, halls, awards, grants, scholarships, fellowships, and statues. Although he through his life had been appreciative of all of them, he &quot;[was] reported to have said he was moved most deeply when a small black church in Ninety Six, South Carolina, renamed itself Mays United Methodist Church. There are numerous memorials to Mays in the United States, including:
* Benjamin Elijah Mays High School, in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.
* Benjamin E. Mays Drive in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.
* Benjamin E. Mays Archives in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.
* Benjamin E. Mays National Memorial in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.
* The Statue of Benjamin E. Mays at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. 
* Benjamin Mays Hall of Howard University, in Washington, D.C., U.S.

=== Medal of Freedom effort ===
After Mays stepped down from the Atlanta Board of Education presidency in 1981, a petition was sent to the desk of U.S. President Ronald Reagan requesting that Mays be given the Presidential Medal of Freedom, but it was turned down. Georgian representative John Lewis proposed a bill in January 1993 that would commemorate Mays on a federal stamp and requested that Mays be given the Medal of Freedom posthumously. The request was sent to U.S. President Bill Clinton but his time as president ended before he could address the request. A request was sent once again to U.S. President George W. Bush by Georgian representatives Max Cleland and Zell Miller which passed both houses of Congress but has yet to be signed by a U.S. president. The petition was sent once more in 2012 to U.S. President Barack Obama, yet failed to be awarded.

<doc id="1256552" wikidata="Q7243682" url="?curid=1256552" title="Primrose syndrome">
<text>Primrose syndrome is a rare, slowly progressive genetic disorder that can vary symptomatically between individual cases, but is generally characterised by ossification of the external ears, learning difficulties, and facial abnormalities. It was first described in 1982 in Scotland&#x27;s Royal National Larbert Institution by Dr D.A.A. Primrose.

Primrose syndrome appears to occur spontaneously, regardless of family history. The cause is currently unknown and there are no known treatments.

==Signs and symptoms==
The common symptoms in all reported cases of primrose syndrome include ossified pinnae, learning disabilities or intellectual disability, hearing problems, movement disorders (ataxia, paralysis, and parkinsonism among others—likely due, in part, to calcification of the basal ganglia), a torus palatinus (a neoplasm on the mouth&#x27;s hard palate), muscle atrophy, and distorted facial features. Other symptoms usually occur, different in each case, but it is unknown whether or not these symptoms are caused by the same disease.

==Pathophysiology==

The cause of Primrose syndrome is currently unknown. This condition is extremely rare and seems to spontaneously occur, regardless of family history.

In the case studied by Dalai et al. in 2010, it was found that an abnormally high amount of calcitonin, a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland to stabilize blood calcium levels, was present in the blood serum. This suggests that the thyroid gland is releasing an abnormal amount of calcitonin, resulting in the disruption of calcium level homeostasis. No molecular cause was found, but an expanded microarray analysis of the patient found a 225.5 kb deletion on chromosome 11p between rs12275693 and rs1442927. Whether or not this deletion is related to the syndrome or is a harmless mutation is unknown. The deletion was not present in the patient&#x27;s mother&#x27;s DNA sample, but the father&#x27;s DNA was unavailable.

==Diagnosis==
==Management==
Currently there are no known treatments.

==History==
There have been very few reported cases of Primrose syndrome worldwide. The first known case was described by D.A. Primrose in 1982. The patient was a 33-year-old intellectually disabled male whose outer ears had ossified. Additional symptoms included muscle atrophy in the legs and hands, deafness, cataracts, and a tissue mass covering the roof of his mouth.

In 1986, Calacott et al. described a mentally disabled patient whose pinnae had ossified. The patient also experienced deafness, cataracts, skeletal deformities, and muscle atrophy. As the second reported case of such symptoms, it suggested that these symptoms were part of one entity, named &quot;Primrose syndrome&quot;

In 1996, Lindor et al. reported a 43-year-old male patient with schizophrenia, as well as other neurological disorders, and severe pinnae calcification. Additional symptoms included hearing loss, stiffened joints, and facial deformities.

In 2006, Mathijssen et al. described an adult male intellectually disabled patient who had calcified pinnae and a neoplasm of the palate. The patient also had extensive hearing loss, little to no body hair, distorted facial features, and joint contractures. The patient also developed testicular cancer, but it is unknown whether or not it is related to the syndrome. The patient experienced cryptorchidism, a birth defect where one of the testes is not present at birth, that may have played a part in the formation of the tumor.

In 2010, another similar case was studied extensively by Dalal et al. The patient was an intellectual disabled 43-year-old woman who had hearing impairment, distorted facial features, muscle atrophy, cataracts, and ossification of cartilage. Additionally, she was born with Ebstein malformation, a congenital heart defect, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and hip dysplasia. Other symptoms included hypothyroidism, diabetes, and muscle control problems. A brain MRI showed that her basal ganglia had partially calcified, which may have contributed to her paraparesis and motor tics.

<text>Zebra is a discontinued routing software package that provides TCP/IP based routing services with routing protocols support such as RIP, OSPF and BGP. Zebra also supports BGP Route Reflector and Route Server behavior. In addition to IPv4 routing protocols, Zebra also supports IPv6 routing protocols.

Zebra provided a high quality, multi server routing engine. Zebra has an interactive user interface for each routing protocol and supports common client commands. Due to this design, new protocol daemons can be easily added. Zebra library can also be used as a program&#x27;s client user interface.

Zebra is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

==History==
The idea for Zebra originally came from Kunihiro Ishiguro, after he realized the need for quality routing software. While working at an ISP joint venture between British Telecom and Marubeni, Ishiguro encountered venture capitalist Yoshinari Yoshikawa.

Yoshinari Yoshikawa shared Ishiguro&#x27;s vision for a new routing engine and they combined resources to create the world&#x27;s first routing engine software. The resulting entity, known as the Zebra Project, was started in 1996.

Ishiguro and Yoshikawa led the IP Infusion company and market a commercial version of Zebra, known as &quot;ZebOS&quot;. This ZebOS is being used in networking products, such as FortiOS and the Citrix NetScaler.

The official website announced that &quot;Zebra has been decommissioned&quot;.

Since its last release (version 0.95) in 2005-09-08, development of Zebra stopped. A new project emerged as the unofficial successor of Zebra: Quagga.

<doc id="1256559" wikidata="Q7562539" url="?curid=1256559" title="Facial nerve paralysis">
<text>Facial nerve paralysis is a common problem that involves the paralysis of any structures innervated by the facial nerve. The pathway of the facial nerve is long and relatively convoluted, so there are a number of causes that may result in facial nerve paralysis. The most common is Bell&#x27;s palsy, a disease of unknown cause that may only be diagnosed by exclusion of identifiable serious causes.
==Signs and symptoms==
Facial nerve paralysis is characterised by facial weakness, usually only in one side of the face, with other symptoms possibly including loss of taste, hyperacusis and decreased salivation and tear secretion. Other signs may be linked to the cause of the paralysis, such as vesicles in the ear, which may occur if the facial palsy is due to shingles. Symptoms may develop over several hours. Acute facial pain radiating from the ear may precede the onset of other symptoms. 

==Causes==

===Bell&#x27;s palsy===

Bell&#x27;s palsy is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis. There is no known cause of Bell&#x27;s palsy, although it has been associated with herpes simplex infection. Bell&#x27;s palsy may develop over several days, and may last several months, in the majority of cases recovering spontaneously. It is typically diagnosed clinically, in patients with no risk factors for other causes, without vesicles in the ear, and with no other neurological signs. Recovery may be delayed in the elderly, or those with a complete paralysis. Bell&#x27;s palsy is often treated with corticosteroids.

===Infection===
Lyme disease, an infection caused by &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; bacteria and spread by ticks, can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common. In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota, but it is expanding into other areas. The first sign of about 80% of Lyme infections, typically one or two weeks after a tick bite, is usually an expanding rash that may be accompanied by headaches, body aches, fatigue, or fever. In up to 10-15% of Lyme infections, facial palsy appears several weeks later, and may be the first sign of infection that is noticed, as the Lyme rash typically does not itch and is not painful. Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics.

Reactivation of varicella zoster virus, as well as being associated with Bell&#x27;s palsy, may also be a direct cause of facial nerve palsy. Reactivation of latent virus within the geniculate ganglion is associated with vesicles affecting the ear canal, and termed Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2. In addition to facial paralysis, symptoms may include ear pain and vesicles, sensorineural hearing loss, and vertigo. Management includes antiviral drugs and oral steroids.

Otitis media is an infection in the middle ear, which can spread to the facial nerve and inflame it, causing compression of the nerve in its canal. Antibiotics are used to control the otitis media, and other options include a wide myringotomy (an incision in the tympanic membrane) or decompression if the patient does not improve. 
Chronic otitis media usually presents in an ear with chronic discharge (otorrhea), or hearing loss, with or without ear pain (otalgia). Once suspected, there should be immediate surgical exploration to determine if a cholesteatoma has formed as this must be removed if present. Inflammation from the middle ear can spread to the canalis facialis of the temporal bone - through this canal travels the facial nerve together with the statoacoustisus nerve. In the case of inflammation the nerve is exposed to edema and subsequent high pressure, resulting in a periferic type palsy.

===Trauma===
In blunt trauma, the facial nerve is the most commonly injured cranial nerve. Physical trauma, especially fractures of the temporal bone, may also cause acute facial nerve paralysis. Understandably, the likelihood of facial paralysis after trauma depends on the location of the trauma. Most commonly, facial paralysis follows temporal bone fractures, though the likelihood depends on the type of fracture.

&quot;Transverse fractures&quot; in the horizontal plane present the highest likelihood of facial paralysis (40-50%). Patients may also present with blood behind the tympanic membrane, sensory deafness, and vertigo; the latter two symptoms due to damage to vestibulocochlear nerve and the inner ear. &quot;Longitudinal fracture&quot; in the vertical plane present a lower likelihood of paralysis (20%). Patients may present with blood coming out of the external auditory meatus), tympanic membrane tear, fracture of external auditory canal, and conductive hearing loss. In patients with mild injuries, management is the same as with Bell&#x27;s palsy – protect the eyes and wait. In patients with severe injury, progress is followed with nerve conduction studies. If nerve conduction studies show a large (&gt;90%) change in nerve conduction, the nerve should be decompressed. The facial paralysis can follow immediately the trauma due to direct damage to the facial nerve, in such cases a surgical treatment may be attempted. In other cases the facial paralysis can occur a long time after the trauma due to oedema and inflammation. In those cases steroids can be a good help.

===Tumors===
A tumor compressing the facial nerve anywhere along its complex pathway can result in facial paralysis. Common culprits are facial neuromas, congenital cholesteatomas, hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, parotid gland neoplasms, or metastases of other tumours.

Often, since facial neoplasms have such an intimate relationship with the facial nerve, removing tumors in this region becomes perplexing as the physician is unsure how to manage the tumor without causing even more palsy. Typically, benign tumors should be removed in a fashion that preserves the facial nerve, while malignant tumors should always be resected along with large areas of tissue around them, including the facial nerve. While this will inevitably lead to facial paralysis, safe removal of a malignant neoplasm is vital for patient survival. After tumor removal, the facial nerve can be reinnervated with techniques such as cross-facial nerve grafting, nerve transfers and end-to-end nerve repair. Alternative treatment methods include muscle transfer techniques, such as the gracilis free muscle transfer or static procedures. 

Patients with facial nerve paralysis resulting from tumours usually present with a progressive, twitching paralysis, other neurological signs, or a recurrent Bell&#x27;s palsy-type presentation.
The latter should always be suspicious, as Bell&#x27;s palsy should not recur. A chronically discharging ear must be treated as a cholesteatoma until proven otherwise; hence, there must be immediate surgical exploration. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging should be used to identify the location of the tumour, and it should be managed accordingly.

Other neoplastic causes include leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

===Stroke===
Central facial palsy can be caused by a lacunar infarct affecting fibers in the internal capsule going to the nucleus. The facial nucleus itself can be affected by infarcts of the pontine arteries. Unlike peripheral facial palsy, central facial palsy does not affect the forehead, because the forehead is served by nerves coming from both motor cortexes.

===Other===
Other causes may include:
* Diabetes mellitus
* Facial nerve paralysis, sometimes bilateral, is a common manifestation of sarcoidosis of the nervous system, neurosarcoidosis.
* Bilateral facial nerve paralysis may occur in Guillain–Barré syndrome, an autoimmune condition of the peripheral nervous system.
* Moebius syndrome is a bilateral facial paralysis resulting from the underdevelopment of the VII cranial nerve (facial nerve), which is present at birth. The VI cranial nerve, which controls lateral eye movement, is also affected, so people with Moebius syndrome cannot form facial expression or move their eyes from side to side. Moebius syndrome is extremely rare, and its cause or causes are not known.
* Facial piercings, namely eyebrow piercings or tongue piercings, can in very rare cases cause damage to the facial nerve.

==Diagnosis==
A medical history and physical examination, including a neurological examination, are needed for diagnosis. The first step is to observe what parts of the face do not move normally when the person tries to smile, blink, or raise the eyebrows. If the forehead wrinkles normally, a diagnosis of central facial palsy is made, and the person should be evaluated for stroke. Otherwise, the diagnosis is peripheral facial palsy, and its cause needs to be identified, if possible. Ramsey Hunt&#x27;s syndrome causes pain and small blisters in the ear on the same side as the palsy. Otitis media, trauma, or post-surgical complications may alternatively become apparent from history and physical examination. If there is a history of trauma, or a tumour is suspected, a CT scan or MRI may be used to clarify its impact. Blood tests or x-rays may be ordered depending on suspected causes. The likelihood that the facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease should be estimated, based on recent history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats during warmer months, recent history of rash or symptoms such as headache and fever, and whether the palsy affects both sides of the face (much more common in Lyme than in Bell&#x27;s palsy). If that likelihood is more than negligible, a serological test for Lyme disease should be performed. If the test is positive, the diagnosis is Lyme disease. If no cause is found, the diagnosis is Bell&#x27;s Palsy.

===Classification===

Facial nerve paralysis may be divided into supranuclear and infranuclear lesions. In a clinical setting, other commonly used classifications include: intra-cranial and extra-cranial; acute, subacute and chronic duration.

====Supranuclear and nuclear lesions====
Central facial palsy can be caused by a lacunar infarct affecting fibers in the internal capsule going to the nucleus. The facial nucleus itself can be affected by infarcts of the pontine arteries. These are corticobulbar fibers travelling in internal capsule.

====Infranuclear lesions====
Infranuclear lesions refer to the majority of causes of facial palsy.

==Treatment==
If an underlying cause has been found for the facial palsy, it should be treated. If it is estimated that the likelihood that the facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease exceeds 10%, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. All other patients should be treated with corticosteroids and, if the palsy is severe, antivirals. Facial palsy is considered severe if the person is unable to close the affected eye completely or the face is asymmetric even at rest. Corticosteroids initiated within three days of Bell&#x27;s palsy onset have been found to increase chances of recovery, reduce time to recovery, and reduce residual symptoms in case of incomplete recovery. However, for facial palsy caused by Lyme disease, corticosteroids have been found in some studies to harm outcomes. Other studies have found antivirals to possibly improve outcomes relative to corticosteroids alone for severe Bell&#x27;s palsy. In those whose blinking is disrupted by the facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping. Several surgical treatment options exist to restore symmetry to the paralyzed face in patients where function does not return (see section Tumors above).

== Prognostic ==
A study followed thirty individuals with facial paralysis following a stroke. Six months after the onset of paralysis, two-thirds of the patients had fully recovered or only had mild facial paralysis.

In the case of Bell&#x27;s palsy, 71% of individuals fully recover without any sequelae. Additionally, the majority of individuals begin to recover within seven days after the onset of paralysis.

<text>The siege of Hōjūjidono (法住寺合戦, &quot;Hōjūji kassen&quot;) was a siege that took place in Kyoto, Japan in 1184. It was part of the Genpei War and a key element of the conflict between Minamoto no Yoshinaka and his cousins Yoritomo and Yoshitsune for control of the Minamoto clan.

== Overview ==
During the Genpei War (1180–1185), the retired and cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa supported the Minamoto clan, but got caught up in the internal power struggles.

For some time, Yoshinaka had desired to seize control of the clan from his cousins. Upon returning to Kyoto from his victories at Shinohara and Kurikara, he decided to split from the clan, plotting with Minamoto no Yukiie to kidnap Emperor Go-Shirakawa, and establish a government of their own, in the provinces north of Kyoto. But Yukiie did not, in the end, aid Yoshinaka in this scheme.
Yoshinaka attacked the Hōjūjidono (also known as the Hōjūji Palace), set it aflame, killed the defenders, and seized Emperor Go-Shirakawa. Yoshinaka brutally attacked the emperor&#x27;s troops in addition to gaining control over Shirakawa&#x27;s Imperial Prison.

He was opposed by a number of court nobles and warrior monks from Mount Hiei and Miidera, but ultimately made it out of the city victorious, with the cloistered emperor as hostage.

However, at this point, the Minamoto armies, under Yukiie, Yoritomo, Yoshitsune, and Noriyori were surrounding the capital. Yoshinaka fled across the Bridge of Uji, where he fought the second Battle of Uji.

<text>Radomir ( ) is a town in the Radomir Municipality in the Pernik Province of Bulgaria.

== Geography ==
The town of Radomir is located at 764 meters above sea level in the Radomir valley, at the foot of Mount Golo Bardo. It is the center of the historical-geographical region of Mraka. The climate is humid-continental (Dfb).

== History ==
The town was first mentioned in a 15th-century source as &quot;Uradmur&quot;. The current form appears for the first time in a source from 1488. The name is derived directly from the personal name &quot;Radomir&quot; or its adjectival form.

Not many names of priests and clergymen have been preserved in the history of the small town, but it is a fact that the Radomir valley was defended in the Christian spirit even after the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule at the end of the 14th century. In 1418 a wave of discontent broke out in the vicinity of Radomir against the heavy taxes imposed by the Ottoman rulers. At that time the population did not exceed 6-7 thousand people in the whole valley, but it gave good handicrafts. The locals were mostly farmers and stockbreeders, but the craft went hand in hand with them. Very famous were the so-called &quot;katzars&quot;, who produced barrels known as far as the Aegean. In the village of Dren there were woodcarvers incomparable in mastery. 1831 Ottoman population statistics show that 41% of the Christians in the kaza of Radomir, which included Pernik Province, were non-taxpayers and 82% of Christians were recorded as middle-class.

The population has a vigilant national consciousness. The first schools in Radomir were established by people who devoted themselves to worship. One of the prominent personalities during the national revival was Archimandrite Zinovii Poppetrov, who developed his vigilant activity in this area.

In 1918, Bulgaria was ruled by Ferdinand of Bulgaria, under whom Aleksandar Stamboliyski had been imprisoned for opposing Bulgaria&#x27;s participation in the Balkan War and its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. When in September the Allied forces broke into Bulgaria, Ferdinand agreed to release Stamboliyski in return for a promise to help restore order in the military. However, Stamboliyski instead aligned himself with the uprising and in Radomir proclaimed Bulgaria to be a republic. His supporters then attempted an attack on Sofia. The Radomir Rebellion was stopped when this force was defeated by Bulgarian and German tsarists, who also did not retain control for long as Bulgaria had signed an armistice with the Allies by the end of the month.

== Places of interest ==
The village of Baykalsko is a quiet and beautifully preserved natural settlement. The old church of Sveta Bogoroditsa, partially destroyed and rebuilt in the 19th century, has a recently restored, historic bell tower. A new cemetery bears the remains of generations on the opposite side of the village. The mayor&#x27;s office and the post office are located across from the church of Bogoroditsa. The village is home to fewer elderly people and a growing population of seasonal visitors. Natural trails leading in and about nearby Konyavo Mountain, and the Choklyovo Marsh (, ), are tourist attractions of Baykalsko. The old name of the village, Choklyovo, has not been restored to date.

The marsh of Choklyovo is a preserved area (Regional Environment and Waters Inspectorate — Sofia), as it is the natural habitat of rare bird species and a repository of therapeutic mud. The village overlooking the lake consists of small houses traditionally made of mud and sticks. There is some small-scale construction from the 1970s and 1980s and several newer villas. Legend has it that a medieval ruler, settled opposite the lake, issued a decree for all houses to face in his direction.

Baykalsko may be reached by bus from Sofia or Kyustendil, or by train via Zemen. Bed &amp; breakfast accommodations are available by arrangement.

Radomir is the boza capital of Bulgaria, often called Bozenburg.

== Sport ==
The town is home to the FK Strumska Slava football team.

== Royalty ==
Radomir (1000–?) was also the name of a Bulgarian prince.

Radomir was the surname of Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria (Bulgarian: Гаврил Радомир), who ruled Bulgaria from October 1014 to August 1015.

<doc id="1256573" wikidata="Q581292" url="?curid=1256573" title="Aouzou Strip">
<text>The Aouzou Strip (; , ) is a strip of land in northern Chad that lies along the border with Libya, extending south to a depth of about 100 kilometers into Chad&#x27;s Borkou, Ennedi Ouest, Ennedi Est, and Tibesti regions for an area of 114,000 km2. It is named after the small town and oasis of Aouzou. The strip played a significant role in the Chadian–Libyan War when it was claimed by Libya.

==Inclusion in Italian Libya==

The Aouzou strip was defined for the first time in the discussions between France and Italy after World War I, in relation to an award to Italy for the victory in that war. At the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, the Kingdom of Italy did not receive any of the German colonies, but instead was given the Oltre Giuba from the United Kingdom, and France agreed to give some Saharan territories to Italian Libya.

After many discussions during the 1920s, in 1935 the Franco-Italian Agreement was signed between Benito Mussolini and Pierre Laval, which included a provision under which Italy would receive the Aouzou strip, which was to be added to Libya. France&#x27;s other motivations in concluding this agreement with Italy were to settle the status of the Italian Tunisian community in its protectorate of the country, to remove irredentist Italian claims to Nice, and to prevent Italy from growing closer to Nazi Germany by keeping it closely aligned with France and the United Kingdom (the Stresa Front).

This policy failed two years later when Italy drifted into the German orbit by concluding the Pact of Steel with Nazi Germany, leading to the &quot;instruments of ratification&quot; of the Mussolini-Laval Treaty never being exchanged with France. Despite this, the new border was conventionally assumed to be the southern boundary of Libya until 1955.

==History==

Claimed to be rich in uranium deposits, the area was the cause of dispute of Chad with Libya, which led to a war between the two countries. In 1973, Libya engaged in military operations in the Aouzou Strip to gain access to minerals and to use it as a base of influence in Chadian politics. This ultimately resulted in the Chadian–Libyan conflict. Libya then claimed an area it called the Borderlands which included the Aouzou Strip.

Libya argued that the territory, as part of the Borderlands, was inhabited by indigenous people who owed vassalage to the Senoussi Order and subsequently to the Ottoman Empire, and that this title had been inherited by Libya. It also supported its claim with an unratified 1935 treaty between France and Italy (the &quot;Mussolini-Laval Treaty&quot;), the colonial powers of Chad and Libya, respectively, that confirmed the possession of the strip by Italy.

The frontier claimed by the Chadian government was based on a 1955 treaty between France and Libya, which, in turn, referred back to an 1899 agreement between Great Britain and France about &quot;spheres of influence.&quot; Despite other differences, this was one position on which all Chadian political parties and factions were able to agree.

Libya occupied the Aouzou Strip during the first half of 1973. During the so-called Toyota War in 1987, the final stage of the Chadian–Libyan conflict, Chadian forces were able to force the Libyans to temporarily retreat from part of the Strip. A cease-fire between Chad and Libya held from 1987 to 1988, followed by unsuccessful negotiations over the next several years. 

In 1990, the territorial dispute was referred for adjudication to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Finally, a February 1994 ICJ decision found (by a majority of 16 to 1) in favour of Chad&#x27;s sovereignty over the Borderlands and the Aouzou Strip, and ended the Libyan claim.

The United Nations Security Council established the United Nations Aouzou Strip Observer Group in Resolution 915 (May 1994) to monitor the withdrawal of Libyan troops, and terminated it in Resolution 926 (June 1994), when the withdrawal was completed.

<doc id="1256575" wikidata="Q2023934" url="?curid=1256575" title="One-Two-Go Airlines">
<text>One-Two-Go Airlines Co. Ltd () was a low-cost airline based in Don Mueang district, Bangkok, Thailand. Its main base was Don Mueang International Airport, Bangkok. It was owned and managed by Orient Thai Airlines and CEO Udom Tantiprasongchai and his wife Nina Tantiprasongchai. The One-Two-Go brand was retired in July 2010, after the fatal crash of flight OG 269 in September 2007 was blamed substantially on misconduct by the airline, with the aircraft re-branded under Orient Thai Airlines. On 9 October 2018, Orient Thai Airlines ceased all operations.

== History ==
The airline started operations on 3 December 2003.

Following the crash of Flight 269 in Phuket, Thailand on 16 September 2007, One-Two-Go was banned from flying in European Union nations due to safety concerns.

On 8 April 2009, the European Commission added One-Two-Go Airlines to its blacklist of airline operators banned from entering European airspace.

Corruption within One-Two-Go Airlines and the Thai Department of Civil Aviation was a factor for the crash investigators of Flight 269.

Australia&#x27;s Channel 9 broadcast a program in November 2007 which detailed accusations of maintenance fraud and specifically by CEO Udom Tantiprasongchai, coercion and bribery of pilots to fly excessive hours. The program contained an interview with lead Thai investigator Director-General Vuttichai Singhamany as he reviewed the daily flight rosters for One-Two-Go given to him by reporter Ferguson, documenting the Captain and First Officer&#x27;s schedules showing that both pilots had flown beyond the legal limit for the week and for the month of the crash. Director-General Vuttichai said he would demand an explanation for the fraud from One-Two-Go.

In late February 2008, the victim&#x27;s families, concerned about the impartiality and transparency of the crash investigation, created a website and on-line petition called InvestigateUdom.com calling for a proper investigation into the root causes of the crash.

The lead Thai Department of Civil Aviation investigator reported that documents he had received from One-Two-Go were fiction. The National Transportation Safety Board (which were also investigating the accident) report included the true work rosters, obtained by the family of a victim. The United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report documented possible check ride fraud among four other One-Two-Go pilots in the months following the crash.

Three years after the crash, the British government began its inquest process into the deaths of the eight British citizens killed. The inquest, held 22–23 March 2011, was presided over by H.M. Coroner, S.P.G. Fisher. Coroner Fisher relied on a British aviation investigator, the NTSB, and Thai reports, and victim and family statements to make his conclusions. He cited the &quot;flagrant disregard for passenger safety&quot; by the airline and said, &quot;the primary failure so far as I am concerned relates to the corporate culture which prevailed both One-Two-Go Airlines and Orient Thai Airlines prior to and following the air crash.&quot; Fisher twice contacted the airline to send a representative to the hearing. The airline replied that they would not take part in the proceedings.

== Former destinations ==
During its seven-year existence, One-Two-Go Airlines served the following domestic destinations, all from its base at Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok:

*Chiang Mai (Chiang Mai International Airport)
*Chiang Rai (Chiang Rai International Airport)
*Phuket (Phuket International Airport)
*Surat Thani (Surat Thani International Airport)
*Nakhon Si Thammarat (Nakhon Si Thammarat Airport)
*Trang (Trang Airport)
*Khon Kaen (Khon Kaen Airport)
*Krabi (Krabi International Airport)
*Ubon Ratchathani (Ubon Ratchathani Airport)
*Phitsanulok (Phitsanulok Airport)
*Narathiwat (Narathiwat Airport)
*Udon Thani (Udon Thani International Airport)
*Hat Yai (Hat Yai International Airport)

==Former fleet==

One-Two-Go Airlines had operated the following aircraft:

*6 McDonnell Douglas MD-82 (Operated by Orient Thai Airlines)

*1 McDonnell Douglas MD-83

*2 McDonnell Douglas MD-87
*4 Boeing 757-200 (operated by Orient Thai Airlines)

*2 Boeing 747-100 (operated by Orient Thai Airlines)

*2 Boeing 747-300 (operated by Orient Thai Airlines)

The airline was in negotiations to purchase several used MD-80s aircraft for expansion. This never happened.

== Incidents and accidents ==

On 16 September 2007, One-Two-Go Airlines Flight 269, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82 (registered as HS-OMG) flying from Bangkok with 123 passengers and seven crew members, crashed in strong winds and heavy rain after attempting to land at Phuket International Airport. The aircraft was mostly destroyed in the blazing inferno that soon developed after the crash as the fuselage tore in two. 90 people were killed, including 5 of the crew members. 45 of the dead were tourists. In addition to the 90 dead, 26 people were &quot;seriously injured&quot; and 14 &quot;suffered minor injuries&quot;. Thai aviation officials initially claimed that weather was a probable factor. The cause of the crash was later determined to be multiple flight crew errors caused by systemic failures including corruption and lack of training at One-Two-Go and within Thailand&#x27;s Civil Aviation Authority, Department of Civil Aviation. &quot;An Australian television show&quot; says that One-Two-Go violated safety rules, such as by having pilots fly without getting enough rest, and submitted fake documentation to hide it.

<text>Tellabs, Inc. is a global network technology company that provides networking and communications solutions to both private and governmental agencies. The company offers a range of products and services, including optical transport systems, access systems, managed access solutions, and network management software. The company was founded by Michael Birck in 1974 and is headquartered in Carrollton, Texas. It is currently owned by Marlin Equity Partners, who established an independent business for its product portfolio to accelerate the development of Optical local area network (OLAN) technology. Designed for enterprise and government clients, OLAN uses fiber, which is faster, more secure, and more stable compared to traditional copper infrastructure.

==History==

=== Early years ===
Tellabs traces its roots to a meeting in 1974 over a kitchen table in suburban Chicago. According to company founder Michael Birck, a group of six men with backgrounds in electrical engineering and sales drank coffee and brainstormed ideas for a new telecom company. Their aim was to build a company that offered products and services tailored to customer needs. After raising $110,000 in capital, they incorporated as Tellabs in the spring of 1975; the name combined the idea of telephones and laboratories. The start-up only had a one-man research department, a second-hand soldering iron picked up for $25, and an outdated oscilloscope. In a matter of months, Tellabs began making echo suppressors, which suppress annoying echoes on phone calls. During this time, the founding partners drew no salaries. 

The company went public in July 1980, ending the year with sales of $43.7 million. In September 1981, Tellabs introduced the industry&#x27;s first echo canceller, an advance over the original echo suppressors that synthesized an echo and electronically subtracted it. By 1990, Tellabs had grown to 2,000 employees at 25 locations globally and sales of $211 million.

Tellabs made several acquisitions and expanded globally in the 1980s and into the 1990s, including Coherent Communications Systems Corp. and Martis Oy in Finland. In 1991, the company took a new direction, releasing its SONET-based TITAN 5500 digital cross-connect system. These systems switched traffic from one circuit to another, connecting traffic inside and between networks.

Richard Notebaert, who had led Ameritech, the Midwestern AT&amp;T spin-off until it was acquired by SBC in 1999, took over Tellabs as CEO in September 2000. Pundits labeled Notebaert the “$6 billion man.” However, as the Chicago Sun-Times also reported, the telecom industry also collapsed. The Chicago Sun-Times reported: “Telecom went from boom to bust as venture capital dried up and customers cancelled orders for the sort of equipment made by Tellabs and its competitors, including Nortel Networks and Lucent Technologies.” In 2003, following industry trends and after 28 years as a manufacturer, Tellabs sold its last plant in Illinois and outsourced its manufacturing. The company continued downsizing.

=== 2003 to present ===
In 2003, Tellabs began offering residential Broadband PON in a partnership with Verizon FiOS. Krish Prabhu, former chief operating officer of Alcatel took over as CEO in February 2004. Prabhu saw opportunities as Internet usage grew demanding faster connections as well as video and better VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calling. Tellabs acquired two companies in 2004. They purchased Advanced Fiber Communications (AFC), a provider of broadband access solutions with a customer base of more than 800 service providers worldwide at the time of the merger in a deal worth $1.9 billion and Marconi Communications North American Access, which sold fiber-access services to regional Bell operating companies and local exchange carriers. At the time of the merger, Marconi had a customer base that included many of the world&#x27;s largest telecommunications operators, managing more than 4 million lines of capacity and about 1 million deployed lines. By 2007, nearly half of Tellabs&#x27; revenue came from products added since 2003.

Prabhu also presided over more cutbacks as the telecom industry continued to struggle. In January 2008, Tellabs announced that it was cutting 225 jobs during the year. This would leave Tellabs with about 3,500 jobs, down from a peak of 9,000 during the boom in 2001. Prabhu stepped down in March 2008 for personal reasons; Birck praised him at his departure. Tellabs internally promoted Robert W. Pullen, who had 23 years of varied experience at Tellabs, to succeed Prabhu as chief executive and president effective March 1, 2008. He was the chairman of the executive board of the Telecommunications Industry Association. In 2009 Tellabs acquired WiChorus, a San-Jose based Silicon Valley start-up with a mobile packet core platform, a decision that led to the decline of their data business. After Pullen was hospitalized in June 2012 due to cancer, Dan Kelly was appointed acting CEO and president; Kelly later assumed the full offices in November 2012, following Pullen&#x27;s death. Kelly had previously served as executive vice president of global products and had worked with the company for over 25 years.

In 2013, Tellabs was acquired by Marlin Equity Partners, a global investment company. Marlin announced plans to establish an independent business for the Tellabs Access product portfolio, aiming to accelerate Tellabs&#x27; development of Optical local area network (OLAN) technology. Marlin announced it would target OLAN to Enterprise and Government agencies, while continuing to support and expand its Telecommunications portfolio. The Optical Transport, Metro Ethernet and Mobility business units of Tellabs were spun off into Coriant, a separate company owned by Marlin Equity. Mike Dagenais, an industry veteran who had previously served as CEO of Radisys Corporation and as president and CEO of Continuous Computing, was tapped to head Tellabs as president and CEO. The focus of Tellabs is now OLAN technology. OLAN uses fiber, which is faster, more secure, and more stable in comparison to traditional copper infrastructure. For service providers, Tellabs Access Platforms provide Broadband access to more than 5 million homes in North America. On October 11, 2017, it was announced that Jim Norrod had been named president and CEO of Tellabs, following the retirement of Mike Dagenais.

In December 2019, Tellabs announced that Rich Schroder had been appointed president and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Schroder has held numerous positions within Tellabs and most recently served as Chief Operating Officer. Schroder is a telecom industry veteran with past experience running global multi-site organizations in Asia, Europe and across the U.S. on behalf of AFC, Marconi, RELTEC, DSC and Siemens.

==Corporate==
Tellabs global corporate headquarters is located in the northwest quadrant of Dallas, Texas, in the city of Carrollton, Texas.

==Hardware==
===Optical Line Terminals===
The optical line terminal provides centralized end-to-end LAN intelligence, management and control. It also provides aggregation and distribution functions and typically resides in the main data center of a building. An OLT has two primary functions. Converting the signal used by FiOS service providers to the frequency and framing being used in the PON system and coordinating the multiplexing between the conversion devices on the optical network terminals (ONTs) located on the customers&#x27; premises. Tellabs Optical Line Terminals minimize the physical space required within the main data center.

===Optical Network Terminals===
Tellabs designs Optical Network Terminals, aimed for use in high-volume passive optical network (PON) commercial deployments. Tellabs Optical Network Terminals provide narrowband and broadband subscriber services over a PON platform to the IP/Ethernet end-points; all services are supported natively over a single fiber, including analog voice, VoIP, high-speed data, IP video, RF video, smart buildings apps, security, surveillance, environmental and automation for modern high-performance LANs.

==Software==

===Element Management===
Tellabs Panorama PON Manager is the cornerstone of an Optical LAN end-to-end system. It provides centralized intelligence and element management across the entire LAN, from OLT to ONT and extends to subtended powered devices. Tellabs describes its PON Manager as helping define LAN resources in software and then dynamically allocate them, based on real-time requirements.

===Advanced Software Packages===
Tellabs Optical LAN solution is designed to improve LAN availability uptime and increase operational efficiencies and network security. Tellabs offers multiple packages: Advanced Availability Software Package builds LANs that minimize annual network downtime while lowering costs, reducing human error, and improving security; Tellabs Advanced Operational Software Package improves IT efficiencies by increasing the speed of LAN configurations, monitoring, troubleshooting and MACs while once again reducing human error and network security risks; and Tellabs Advanced Security Software Package enhances physical LAN defensibility, enabling consistent protection policies that are centrally managed while continuing to reduce human error and increasing network stability.

==Services==
Tellabs offers three services: Professional Network Services, which it describes as providing support at all stages of the network life cycle, Technical Support Services, which offers a variety of technical support agreement options to meet the specific needs of organization&#x27;s network, and Network Training Services, which offers a variety of network training programs to keep staff up to date to support all phases of network&#x27;s life cycle.

<text>The Qarmatians (; ) were a militant Isma&#x27;ili Shia movement centred in Al-Ahsa in Eastern Arabia, where they established a religious—and, as some scholars have claimed, proto-socialist or utopian socialist—state in 899 CE. Its members were part of a movement that adhered to a syncretic branch of Sevener Ismaili Shia Islam, and were ruled by a dynasty founded by Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Jannabi. They rejected the claim of Fatimid Caliph Abdallah al-Mahdi Billah to imamate and clung to their belief in the coming of the Mahdi, and they revolted against the Fatimid and Abbasid Caliphates.

Mecca was sacked by a Qarmatian leader, Abu Tahir al-Jannabi, outraging the Muslim world, particularly with their theft of the Black Stone and desecration of the Zamzam Well with corpses during the Hajj season of 930 CE.

==Name==
The origin of the name &quot;Qarmatian&quot; is uncertain. According to some sources, the name derives from the surname of the sect&#x27;s founder, Hamdan Qarmat. The name &quot;qarmat&quot; probably comes from the Aramaic for &quot;short-legged&quot;, &quot;red-eyed&quot; or &quot;secret teacher&quot;. Other sources, however, say that the name comes from the Arabic verb (&quot;qarmaṭ&quot;), which means &quot;to make the lines close together in writing&quot; or &quot;to walk with short steps&quot;. The word &quot;Qarmatian&quot; can also refer to a type of Arabic script.

The Qarāmiṭah in Sawad (southern Iraq) were also known as &quot;the Greengrocers&quot; (&quot;al-Baqliyyah&quot;) because they followed the teachings of Abū Hātim al-Zutti, who in 908 forbade animal slaughter. He also forbade radishes and alliums such as garlic, onions, and leeks. By 928, it is uncertain whether the people still held on to those teachings.

==History==
=== Early developments ===
Under the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258 CE), various Shiite groups organised in secret opposition to their rule. Among them were the supporters of the proto-Ismā‘īlī community, of whom the most prominent group were called the &quot;Mubārakiyyah&quot;.

According to the Ismaili school of thought, Imām Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq (702–765) designated his second son, Isma&#x27;il ibn Ja&#x27;far (ca. 721–755), as heir to the Imamate. However, Ismā‘īl predeceased his father. Some claimed he had gone into hiding, but the proto-Ismā‘īlī group accepted his death and therefore accordingly recognized Ismā‘īl&#x27;s eldest son, Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il (746–809), as Imām. He remained in contact with the Mubārakiyyah group, most of whom resided in Kufa.

The split among the Mubārakiyyah came with the death of Muḥammad ibn Ismā‘īl (ca. 813 CE). The majority of the group denied his death; they recognized him as the Mahdi. The minority believed in his death and would eventually emerge in later times as the Isma&#x27;ili Fatimid Caliphate, the precursors to all modern groups.

The majority Ismā‘īlī missionary movement settled in Salamiyah (now in Syria) and had great success in Khuzestan (southwestern Iran), where the Ismā‘īlī leader al-Husayn al-Ahwāzī converted the Kūfan man Ḥamdān in 874 CE, who took the name &quot;Qarmaṭ&quot; after his new faith. Qarmaṭ and his theologian brother-in-law &#x27;Abdān prepared southern Iraq for the coming of the Mahdi by creating a military and religious stronghold. Other such locations grew up in Yemen, in Eastern Arabia (Arabic &quot;Bahrayn&quot;) in 899, and in North Africa. They attracted many new Shi&#x27;i followers because of their activist and messianic teachings. The new proto-Qarmaṭī movement continued to spread into Greater Iran and then into Transoxiana.

===Qarmatian Revolution===

A change in leadership in Salamiyah in 899 led to a split in the movement. The minority Ismā‘īlīs, whose leader had taken control of the Salamiyah centre, began to proclaim their teachings that Imām Muḥammad &quot;had&quot; died and that the new leader in Salamiyah (Abdallah al-Mahdi Billah) was in fact his descendant come out of hiding and was the Mahdi (a Messianic figure who will appear on Earth before the Day of Judgment and rid the world of wrongdoing, injustice and tyranny). Qarmaṭ and his brother-in-law opposed this and openly broke with the Salamiyids; when &#x27;Abdān was assassinated, he went into hiding and subsequently repented. Qarmaṭ became a missionary of the new Imām, Abdallah al-Mahdi Billah (873–934), who founded the Fatimid Caliphate in North Africa in 909.

Nonetheless, the dissident group retained the name Qarmaṭī. Its greatest stronghold remained in Bahrain, which then included much of eastern Arabia as well as the islands that comprise the present state. It was under Abbasid control at the end of the ninth century, but the Zanj Rebellion in Basra disrupted the power of Baghdad. The Qarmaṭians seized their opportunity under their leader, Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Jannabi, a Persian who hailed from Jannaba in coastal Fars. Eventually, from Qatar, he captured Bahrain&#x27;s capital Hajr and al-Hasa in 899, which he made the capital of his state and once in control of the state he sought to set up a utopian society.

The Qarmaṭians instigated what one scholar termed a &quot;century of terror&quot; in Kufa. They considered the pilgrimage to Mecca a superstition, and once in control of the Bahrayni state, they launched raids along the pilgrim routes crossing the Arabian Peninsula. In 906, they ambushed the pilgrim caravan returning from Mecca and massacred 20,000 pilgrims.

Under al-Jannabi (ruled 923–944), the Qarmaṭians came close to capturing Baghdad in 927, and sacked Mecca in 930, The Qarmatians also sacked Medina. In their attack on Islam&#x27;s holiest sites, the Qarmatians desecrated the Zamzam Well with corpses of Hajj pilgrims and took the Black Stone from Mecca to Ain Al Kuayba in Qatif. Holding the Black Stone to ransom, they forced the Abbasids to pay a huge sum for its return in 952, They also besieged Damascus and devastated many of the cities to the north. They took opportunity to sack Salamiyya, as well as Tiberias, before the Abbasid authorities were able to regain control.

The revolution and desecration shocked the Muslim world and humiliated the Abbasids, but little could be done. For much of the tenth century the Qarmatians were the most powerful force in the Persian Gulf and Middle East and controlled the coast of Oman and collecting tribute from the caliph in Baghdad as well as from a rival Isma&#x27;ili imam in Cairo, the head of the Fatimid Caliphate, whose power they did not recognize.

===Qarmatian society===
The land over which they ruled was extremely wealthy with a huge slave-based economy according to academic Yitzhak Nakash:
===Collapse===

According to Farhad Daftary, the catalyst of the collapse of Qarmatian movement as a whole happened in the year 931, when Abu Tahir al-Janabi, the Qarmatian leader in Bahrain, handed over the reins of the state in Bahrain to Abu&#x27;l-Fadl al-Isfahani, a young Persian man who had been believed by the Qarmatians to be the Mahdi. However, Abu Tahir soon realized al-Isfahani&#x27;s appointment was a disastrous mistake, after the &quot;Mahdi&quot; executed some nobles and insulted Muhammad and the other prophets. The incident shocked the Qarmatians and the Islamic community as a whole, and Abu Tahir ordered the youth&#x27;s execution.

Al-Isfahani lasted as leader only 80 days before his execution but greatly weakened the credibility of Qarmatians within the Muslim community in general and heralded the beginning of the end of their revolutionary movements.

After their defeat by the Abbasids in 976, the Qarmatians began to look inwards and their status was reduced to that of a local power. This had severe consequences for the Qarmatians&#x27; ability to extract tribute from the region; according to Arabist historian Curtis Larsen:

In Bahrain and eastern Arabia, the Qarmatian state was replaced by the Uyunid dynasty, and it is believed that by the mid-11th century, Qarmatian communities in Iraq, Iran, and Transoxiana had either been integrated by Fatimid proselytism or disintegrated.

By the mid-10th century, persecution forced the Qarmatians to leave what is now Egypt and Iraq and move to the city of Multan, now in Pakistan. However, prejudice against the Qarmatians did not dwindle, as Mahmud of Ghazni led an expedition against Multan&#x27;s Qarmatian ruler Abdul Fateh Daud in 1005. The city was surrendered, and Fateh Daud was permitted to retain control over the city with the condition that he adhere to Sunnism.

According to the maritime historian Dionisius A. Agius, the Qarmatians finally disappeared in 1067, after they lost their fleet at Bahrain Island and were expelled from Hasa near the Arabian coast by the chief of Banu Murra ibn Amir.

== Imamate of Seven Imams ==
According to Qarmatians, the number of imams was fixed, with Seven Imāms preordained by God. These groups considers Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il to be the messenger – prophet &quot;(Rasūl),&quot; Imām al-Qā&#x27;im and Mahdi to be preserved in hiding, which is referred to as Occultation.

==Ismaili imams not accepted as legitimate by Qarmatians==
In addition, the following Ismaili imams after Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il had been considered heretics of dubious origins by certain Qarmatian groups, who refused to acknowledge the imamate of the Fatimids and clung to their belief in the coming of the Mahdi.
* Isma&#x27;il ibn Ja&#x27;far (765–775)
* Abadullah ibn Muhammad (Ahmad al-Wafi) (813–829)
* Ahmad ibn Abadullah (Muhammad at-Taqi) (829–840)
* Husayn ibn Ahmad (Radi Abdullah) (840–881)
* Abdallah al-Mahdi Billah (881–934) (Founder of Fatimid Caliphate)

==Qarmatian rulers in Eastern Arabia==
* Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Jannabi (894–914)
* Abu Tahir al-Jannabi (914–944)
* Abu Mansur Ahmad (944–970)
* Abu al-Qasim Sa&#x27;id (970–972)
* Abu Yaqub Yousuf (972–977)
*Descendants of Abu Yaqub Yousuf ruled until 1077

== Substitution after Abu Tahir al-Jannabi ==

<text>Teenagers from Outer Space (a.k.a. The Gargon Terror (UK title), The Boy from Outer Space, and originally titled The Ray Gun Terror) is a 1959 American independent black-and-white science fiction cult film released by Warner Bros. The film was produced, written and directed by Tom Graeff and stars David Love, Dawn Bender, Bryan Grant, Harvey B. Dunn, Tom Graeff and King Moody. &quot;Teenagers from Outer Space&quot; was distributed theatrically by Warner Bros. on a double feature with &quot;Gigantis the Fire Monster&quot;. In the film, a young alien named Derek becomes a fugitive on Earth after he defies his crew&#x27;s directive to eradicate human life in order to use Earth as grazing grounds for giant voracious livestock they call Gargons.

In 1987, the film entered the public domain in the United States because Warner Bros. did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.

==Plot==
A flying saucer arrives on Earth, searching for planets suitable to raise Gargons, lobster-like but air-breathing monsters that are a reserve food supply on their home planet. Crewman Thor vaporizes a dog named Sparky with a raygun. Another crew member, Derek, discovers an inscription on Sparky&#x27;s dog tag and concludes Earth is inhabited by intelligent beings, and therefore they must search elsewhere for Gargon raising grounds, since once full-grown Gargons are a grave menace. The other aliens see no need to spare Earth; they regard themselves as the supreme race, and pride themselves that families and friendships are forbidden on their world. Derek draws a raygun on them and reveals an ancient book distributed by an underground rebellion, which commemorates the more humane periods of their world&#x27;s history.

The Captain and Thor disarm Derek. Taking him prisoner, they plan to have Derek tried and executed. The Gargon they brought with them falls sick to Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, indicating that the planet is unusable. While his crew members are distracted, Derek escapes on foot. The Gargon regains consciousness, having adapted to the atmosphere. When the Captain gives his report, he is informed that Derek is the son of the Leader of their race, although he is unaware of this. Thor is sent to hunt down Derek, with orders to bring him back alive or kill him and any other intelligent beings to protect their mission to Earth. The rest of the crew return to their home world, leaving the Gargon in a nearby cave.
Derek finds the address on the dog&#x27;s tag, where he meets Betty Morgan and her Grandpa. They have a room to rent, and Derek inadvertently becomes a boarder. When Betty&#x27;s friend, reporter Joe Rogers, cannot make it to their afternoon swim at Alice Woodward&#x27;s place, Derek tags along with Betty. He shows the tag to Betty, who recognizes it. Derek takes her to the place where the spacecraft landed. He shows her Sparky&#x27;s remains and describes Thor&#x27;s weapon, that can also vaporize humans. Betty vows to help Derek stop his crew mate.

Betty and Derek have several run-ins with Thor, who vaporizes several humans (including Alice and Betty&#x27;s teacher, Professor Simpson) to keep them from raising the alarm. Joe follows up on stories of skeletons popping up all over town. Thor is wounded in a shootout with the police, and kidnaps both Derek and Betty to help him receive medical attention, in the process revealing Derek&#x27;s parentage to them. Two car chases and a gunfight follow. Thor is captured by Earth authorities after plummeting off a cliff in a stolen car.

The Gargon grows immensely large after devouring a policeman investigating the aliens&#x27; landing site and attacks numerous people. Derek and Betty go to the car wreck site to look for Thor&#x27;s raygun. They kiss and Derek vows, &quot;I shall make the Earth my home. And I shall never, never leave it.&quot; The Gargon appears. Derek finds the raygun under a rock, but it is damaged and unable to fire. The Gargon heads towards the town. Derek and Betty follow and confront it, using electricity from the overhead power lines to fuel the raygun&#x27;s components and kill the Gargon. The invading fleet appears in Earth&#x27;s orbit.

Derek retrieves Thor from the police and forces Joe to drive him to the landing site, using the damaged raygun as a bluff. Betty is baffled as to why Derek is acting so brutish and seemingly going back on his vow, but she heeds his plea for her to trust him and does not tell Joe that the raygun is inoperative. At the landing site Derek reunites with the Captain and meets his father for the first time. Derek pretends to feel regret for his insubordination and offers to guide the spaceships to land. Derek then goes into the spacecraft, closes the hatch to cut off the other aliens, and leads the invasion fleet at full speed directly towards his ground location, destroying them all. Derek&#x27;s father, the Captain and Thor are killed in the process. Betty realizes that Derek in fact kept his vow.

==Production==
&quot;Teenagers from Outer Space&quot; was filmed on location in and around Hollywood, California, in the fall of 1956 and winter of 1957. With a number of tell-tale landmarks like Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park and Hollywood High School, which gives away the film&#x27;s otherwise generic location. One notable aspect of the film is that it was largely the work of a single person, Tom Graeff, who, in addition to playing the role of reporter Joe Rogers, wrote, directed, edited and produced the film, on which he also provided cinematography, special effects and music coordination. Producers Bryan and Ursula Pearson (&quot;Thor&quot; and &quot;Hilda&quot;) and Gene Sterling (&quot;The Leader&quot;) provided the film&#x27;s $14,000 budget, which was less than shoestring even by the standards of the day.

===Cost-effective measures===
According to Bryan Pearson, the crew employed many guerrilla tactics in order to cut costs: Director Tom Graeff secured, for free, the location used for Betty Morgan&#x27;s house by posing as a UCLA student (which he had attended and graduated from 5 years earlier). The older woman who owned the house even let the crew use her electricity to power their equipment.

Graeff shot in many nearby locations, mostly in the vicinity of Sunset Boulevard and Highland Avenue, that doubled as more important city landmarks. Graeff&#x27;s steady hand and framing kept most of the real locations subdued, creating a convincing low-budget illusion of a small town.

Other cost-cutting measures did not work as well; the aliens&#x27; costumes were simple flight suits clearly decorated with masking tape, dress shoes covered in socks and surplus Air Force flight helmets. The use of stock footage in lieu of real special effects, and pre-Spielbergian &quot;looking&quot; shots that replaced actual visuals of the invading alien spaceships, seriously undercut the film&#x27;s ending. Props included a single-bolted-joint skeleton re-used for every dead body seen on screen, a multi-channel sound mixer that was not camouflaged (clearly bearing the label &quot;Multichannel Mixer MCM-2&quot;) as a piece of alien equipment and a dime store Hubley&#x27;s &quot;Atomic Disintegrator&quot; toy as the aliens&#x27; disintegrator ray gun.

Graeff hired special effects technician Paul Blaisdell to slightly modify the ray guns with small slivers of mirror to make the guns look as if they were really firing a ray. Blaisdell said Graeff also paid him to design the film&#x27;s one-sheet poster, but Graeff couldn&#x27;t afford Blaisdell&#x27;s fee to design the Gargon monsters that appear in the film (Graeff did those effects himself by superimposing silhouetted images of various animals in Bert I. Gordon fashion).

===Sound design and score===
Graeff also pre-recorded some of the film&#x27;s dialogue for several scenes and had the actors lip-synchronize their dialogue with their scene actions, using a novel synchronization system invented by director Tom Graeff, dubbed Cinemagraph. The film score used stock music, which had been composed by William Loose and Fred Steiner. The same stock music has been recycled in countless B-movies, like &quot;Red Zone Cuba&quot;, &quot;The Killer Shrews&quot; and most notably &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;.

==Release and legacy==
In June 1958 Bryan Pearson, who invested $5,000 in the production with his wife Ursula, took Graeff to court in order to gain back the original investment and a percentage of any profits. The Pearsons had learned that Graeff had allegedly sold the film (originally titled The Boy From Out of This World), which did not happen until early 1959. He heard nothing more on their investment or a percentage of profits to which they were entitled. The legal dispute dragged on for a year. Pearson received his $5,000 investment, but the judge ruled there was no profit to share. Graeff and the Pearsons, who had been good friends during the production of &quot;Teenagers&quot;, never spoke to each other again.

The film failed to perform at the box office, placing further stress on an already-burdened Graeff, and in the fall of 1959, he suffered a breakdown, proclaiming himself as the second coming of Christ.
After a number of public appearances, followed by a subsequent arrest for disrupting a church service, Graeff disappeared from Hollywood until 1964. He committed suicide in 1970.

The film went on to become a cult classic among sci-fi fans and was later shown on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (as well as &quot;riffed&quot;), &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Movie Macabre&quot;, &quot;Off Beat Cinema&quot;, and &quot;Svengoolie&quot;. It was also included as an extra in the video game &quot;Destroy All Humans!&quot;; it becomes unlocked and ready to play in full once the player beats the game.

===Critical reception===
The film opened on June 3, 1959 to negative, but not crippling, reviews: the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; review stated &quot;what a curious little film this is [...] there are flashes of astonishing sensitivity half-buried in the mass of tritisms&quot;. And of the director, Tom Graeff, &quot;when he stops spreading himself so incredibly thin, I think his work will bear watching&quot;.
Writing in &quot;DVD Savant&quot;, although film critic Glenn Erickson described the film as &quot;staged at the level of a high-school play,&quot; with the giant Gargon &quot;...a crudely-matted silhouette that may be the least-convincing [special] effect of the 1950s,&quot; the film nevertheless is &quot;actually quite touching - the show finds its own humble level of dramatic integrity.&quot;

==Public domain status==
In 1987, the film entered the public domain in the United States and worldwide because Warner Bros. did not renew the film&#x27;s copyright registration in the 28th year after its creation. As a result, the film has received numerous &quot;bargain bin&quot; DVD releases. &quot;MST3K&quot;″s version was released by Rhino Home Video as part of their &quot;Collection, Volume 6&quot; box set.

<text>Minamoto no Yoshinaka tried to wrest power from his cousins Yoritomo and Yoshitsune, seeking to take command of the Minamoto clan. To that end, he burned the Hōjūji Palace, and kidnapped Emperor Go-Shirakawa. However, his cousins Noriyori and Yoshitsune caught up with him soon afterwards, following him across the Bridge over the Uji, New Year&#x27;s Day, 1184, which Yoshinaka had torn up to impair their crossing.

This was an ironic reversal of the first Battle of the Uji, only four years earlier. Much as the Taira did in that first battle, Minamoto no Yoshitsune led his horsemen across the river, and defeated Yoshinaka.

<doc id="1256592" wikidata="Q1633961" url="?curid=1256592" title="International Intellectual Property Alliance">
<text>The International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) is a coalition of five trade associations representing American companies that produce copyright-protected material, including computer software, films, television programs, music, books, and journals (electronic and print media). Formed in 1984, it seeks to strengthen international copyright protection and enforcement by working with the U.S. government, foreign governments, and private-sector representatives.

==Activities==
IIPA works closely with the U.S. Trade Representative in compiling the annual Special 301 reviews of foreign countries that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative considers to have inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. IIPA was the principal representative of the entertainment industry in assisting the U.S. government in the World Trade Organization (WTO) TRIPS negotiations, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations, and at the Diplomatic Conference leading to the completion in 1996 of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) &quot;Internet&quot; treaties—i.e., the Copyright Treaty and the Performances and Phonograms Treaty.

IIPA has also worked with the U.S. government in drafting Intellectual Property Rights Chapters of free trade agreements. It participates in policy development in copyright and enforcement issues in bilateral and regional initiatives such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). IIPA participates in trade actions brought under trade laws like the Generalized System of Preferences and other trade preference programs.

==Member associations==
The five trade associations that make up the IIPA membership include:
* Association of American Publishers (AAP)
* Entertainment Software Association (ESA)
* Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance (IFTA)
* Motion Picture Association (MPA)
* Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)

<text>This is a chart of cultural periods of [[Peru]] and the Andean Region developed by John Rowe and Edward Lanning and used by some archaeologists studying the area. An alternative dating system was developed by Luis Lumbreras and provides different dates for some archaeological finds.

Most of the cultures of the Late Horizon and some of the cultures of the Late Intermediate joined the Inca Empire by 1493, but the period ends in 1532 because that marks the fall of the Inca Empire after the Spanish conquest. Most of the cut-off years mark either an end of a severe drought or the beginning of one. These marked a shift of the most productive farming to or from the mountains, and tended to mark the end of one culture and the rise of another.

The more recent findings concerning the Norte Chico civilization are not included on this list, as it was compiled before the site at Caral was investigated in detail.

<text>John Middleton Vining (December 23, 1758 – February 1802) was an American lawyer and politician from Dover, in Kent County, Delaware. He was a Continental Congressman from Delaware, and a member of the Federalist Party, who served in the Delaware General Assembly and as United States Representative and United States Senator from Delaware.

==Early life and family==
Vining was born in Dover in the Delaware Colony, son of John and Phoebe Wynkoop Vining. His father was a prominent and successful lawyer and landholder, who had been a Speaker of the Colonial Assembly and Chief Justice of Delaware. He was also the good friend of Caesar Rodney, who stood as godfather for his son John, the subject of this article. Vining&#x27;s father died when his son was eleven years old, and from him John and his sister inherited a large fortune. On November 29, 1790, while he was a U.S. Representative in New York City, he married Anna Maria Seton, a poet, musician, and daughter of William Seton of New York. She fit well into Vining&#x27;s social circle, and they had four sons, John, William, Benjamin and Charles, but she died prematurely in 1800.

==Political career==

Vining studied law under George Read in New Castle, Delaware, and was admitted to the Delaware Bar in 1782, starting a practice in Dover. Because of his family&#x27;s wealth and prominence he was elected three times to represent Delaware in the Continental Congress. First elected April 8, 1784, he served until October 27, 1786, although, like many of his contemporaries, his attendance was irregular. He was then elected to the 1787/88 and 1788/89 sessions of the Delaware House of Assembly.

In a special election on January 7, 1789, Vining defeated four other candidates to win election as the only member from Delaware to the 1st U.S. House of Representatives. Two years later he was re-elected to a second term. Although he arrived weeks late for every session, he was an energetic and conscientious legislator, consistently voting in support of the administration, particularly favoring a strong executive. He served on thirty-eight committees in the 1st U.S. House, including the committee considering the first proposed amendments to the Constitution, and the joint committee on rules.

Vining&#x27;s positions were generally loose-constructionist, or Hamiltonian. Accordingly, he strongly favored the federal assumption of the state&#x27;s revolutionary war debts. In the debate over the location of a national capital, he sought consideration for Wilmington, Delaware, but once that lost, supported an immediate move to Philadelphia, and the later construction of a city on the Potomac River.

In 1793 he returned to Dover, Delaware as a State Senator, but was soon elected to the U.S. Senate. He served there for five years, from March 4, 1793, until his resignation on January 19, 1798, and subsequent retirement from public life.

==Death and legacy==
Vining died in Dover and is buried in an unmarked grave in the Christ Episcopal Church Cemetery at Dover.

Vining was a handsome, friendly, and outspoken member of a prominent and wealthy family. He was described as a &quot;colorful&quot;, speaker who &quot;brandished a florid metaphor&quot;, but also as &quot;verbose&quot; and &quot;not above resorting to inflammatory language&quot;. His sister, Mary, who was a frequent companion of Anthony Wayne, lived with Vining, and together they entertained frequently and lavishly. Because of this hospitality and generosity he was known as &quot;the pet of Delaware&quot;. But he spent through his fortune and suffering from alcoholism, and the death of his wife, went through a rapid decline on the way to an impoverished and premature death. His sister dedicated herself to raising Vining&#x27;s four sons, but they died young as well, within a year of her death in 1821.

Elizabeth Montgomery in her &quot;Reminiscences in Wilmington&quot; wrote: &quot;His brilliant talents, not nourished by application, withered in the bud. Indolence and generosity engendered extravagance that wasted his substance&quot;.

==Almanac==
Elections were held October 1. Members of the General Assembly took office on October 20 or the following weekday. The State Councilmen were elected for a three-year term and the State Assemblymen for a one-year term. They chose the Continental Congressmen for a one-year term. U.S. Representatives took office March 4 and have a two-year term. The General Assembly chose the U.S. Senators, who took office March 4 for a six-year term.

After 1792 elections were moved to the first Tuesday of October and members of the General Assembly took office on the first Tuesday of January. The Legislative Council was renamed the State Senate and the House of Assembly was renamed the State House of Representatives.

<text>Minamoto no Yoshinaka made his final stand at [[Ōtsu, Shiga|Awazu]], after fleeing from his cousins&#x27; armies, which confronted him after he attacked Kyoto, burning the Hōjūjiden, and kidnapping Emperor Go-Shirakawa. During the pursuit, he was joined by his foster brother Imai Kanehira and Tomoe Gozen.

During the battle, they fought valiantly, holding off Noriyori&#x27;s large force of thousands of men for a time. However, in the end, they both died in battle.

Yoshinaka was struck dead by a stray arrow when his horse became mired in a paddy field. Kanehira committed suicide by leaping off his horse while holding his sword in his mouth.

<doc id="1256620" wikidata="Q2109755" url="?curid=1256620" title="Electrocyclic reaction">
<text>In organic chemistry, an electrocyclic reaction is a type of pericyclic, rearrangement reaction where the net result is one pi bond being converted into one sigma bond or vice versa. These reactions are usually categorized by the following criteria:

* Reactions can be either photochemical or thermal.
* Reactions can be either ring-opening or ring-closing (electrocyclization).
* Depending on the type of reaction (photochemical or thermal) and the number of pi electrons, the reaction can happen through either a conrotatory or disrotatory mechanism.
* The type of rotation determines whether the cis or trans isomer of the product will be formed.

==Classical examples==
The Nazarov cyclization reaction is a named electrocyclic reaction converting divinylketones to cyclopentenones.

A classic example is the thermal ring-opening reaction of 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene. The cis isomer exclusively yields whereas the trans isomer gives the trans,trans diene:

This reaction course can be explained in a simple analysis through the frontier-orbital method: the sigma bond in the reactant will open in such a way that the resulting p-orbitals will have the same symmetry as the HOMO of the product (a hexadiene). The only way to accomplish this is through a conrotatory ring-opening which results in opposite phases for the terminal lobes.

== Stereospecificity of electrocyclic reactions ==
When performing an electrocyclic reaction, it is often desirable to predict the cis/trans geometry of the reaction&#x27;s product. The first step in this process is to determine whether a reaction proceeds through conrotation or disrotation. The table below shows the selectivity rules for thermal and photochemical electrocyclic reactions.

For the example given below, the thermal reaction of (trans,cis,trans)-octa-2,4,6-triene will happen through a disrotatory mechanism. After determining the type of rotation, whether the product will be cis or trans can be determined by examining the starting molecule. In the example below, the disrotation causes both methyls to point upwards, causing the product to be cis-dimethylcyclohexadiene.

In addition, the torquoselectivity in an electrocyclic reaction refers to the direction of rotation. For example, a reaction that is conrotatory can still rotate in two directions, producing enantiomeric products. A reaction that is torquoselective restricts one of these directions of rotation (partially or completely) to produce a product in enantiomeric excess.

==Mechanism of thermal reactions==

=== Woodward–Hoffmann rules ===

Correlation diagrams, which connect the molecular orbitals of the reactant to those of the product having the same symmetry, can then be constructed for the two processes.

These correlation diagrams indicate that only a conrotatory ring opening of 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene is symmetry allowed whereas only a disrotatory ring opening of 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene is symmetry allowed. This is because only in these cases would maximum orbital overlap occur in the transition state. Also, the formed product would be in a ground state rather than an excited state.

=== Frontier molecular orbital theory ===

According to the frontier molecular orbital theory, the sigma bond in the ring will open in such a way that the resulting p-orbitals will have the same symmetry as the HOMO of the product.

For the 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene, only a disrotatory mode would result in p-orbitals having the same symmetry as the HOMO of hexatriene. For the 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene, on the other hand, only a conrotatory mode would result in p-orbitals having the same symmetry as the HOMO of butadiene.

==Mechanism of photochemical reactions==

If the ring opening of 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene were carried out under photochemical conditions the resulting electrocyclization would be occur through a disrotatory mode instead of a conrotatory mode as can be seen by the correlation diagram for the allowed excited state ring opening reaction.

Only a disrotatory mode, in which symmetry about a reflection plane is maintained throughout the reaction, would result in maximum orbital overlap in the transition state. Also, once again, this would result in the formation of a product that is in an excited state of comparable stability to the excited state of the reactant compound.

== Electrocyclic reactions in biological systems ==

Electrocyclic reactions occur frequently in nature. One of the most common such electrocyclizations is the biosynthesis of vitamin D3.

The first step involves a photochemically induced conrotatory ring opening of 7-dehydrocholesterol to form pre vitamin D3. A [1,7]-hydride shift then forms vitamin D3.

Another example is in the proposed biosynthesis of aranotin, a naturally occurring oxepine, and its related compounds.

Enzymatic epoxidation of phenylalanine-derived diketopiperazine forms the arene oxide, which undergoes a 6π disrotatory ring opening electrocyclization reaction to produce the uncyclized oxepine. After a second epoxidation of the ring, the nearby nucleophilic nitrogen attacks the electrophilic carbon, forming a five membered ring. The resulting ring system is a common ring system found in aranotin and its related compounds.

The benzonorcaradiene diterpenoid (below left) was rearranged into the benzocycloheptatriene diterpenoid isosalvipuberlin (right) by boiling a methylene chloride solution. This transformation can be envisaged as a disrotatory electrocyclic reaction, followed by two suprafacial 1,5-sigmatropic hydrogen shifts, as shown below.

==Electrocyclic reactions in organic synthesis==

An often studied electrocyclic reaction is the conrotatory thermal ring-opening of benzocyclobutene. The reaction product is a very unstable ortho-quinodimethane but this molecule can be trapped in an endo addition with a strong dienophile such as maleic anhydride to the Diels-Alder adduct. The chemical yield for the ring opening of the benzocyclobutane depicted in &quot;scheme 2&quot; is found to depend on the nature of the substituent R. With a reaction solvent such as toluene and a reaction temperature of 110 °C, the yield increases going from methyl to isobutylmethyl to (trimethylsilyl)methyl. The increased reaction rate for the trimethylsilyl compound can be explained by silicon hyperconjugation as the βC-Si bond weakens the cyclobutane C-C bond by donating electrons. 
A biomimetic electrocyclic cascade reaction was discovered in relation to the isolation and synthesis of certain endiandric acids:


Asymmetric electrocyclic reactions are an emerging field in contemporary organic synthesis. The most commonly studied reactions in this field are the 4π Staudinger β-lactam synthesis and the 4π Nazarov reaction; asymmetric catalysis of both reactions have been controlled by use of a chiral auxiliary, and the Nazarov reaction has been performed catalytically using chiral Lewis acids, Brønsted acids and chiral amines.

<text>Pauline Bewick (4 September 1935 – 28 July 2022) was an English-born Irish artist.

Bewick was born in Northumberland, England on 4 September 1935, and with her mother Alice (&#x27;Harry&#x27;) and sister Hazel, moved many times between England and Ireland, before finally settling in County Kerry where she lived and worked, near Caragh Lake. She claimed to be distantly related to actress Meryl Streep, through her mother. She was a descendant of 19th-century artist Thomas Bewick.

In her teens, Bewick started studying at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, and after graduation, moved to London. During her time there she illustrated a children&#x27;s animated television series for the BBC and also produced illustrations for books and magazines. On her return to Dublin she took jobs in singing and acting, and in 1957 opened her first exhibition there.

She married her husband Pat in 1963, and gave birth to two daughters, Poppy and Holly. In 2015, her husband Pat had contracted Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

A prolific artist, Bewick painted in oil, sculpted, and worked with cloth, but was most associated with watercolours. For the last decade or so she had been working on her &quot;Yellow Man&quot; project, a large collection of works featuring a cartoon-like yellow horned figure. In 2006 she donated a collection of 200 works including tapestries, wall hangings, watercolours and sketches to the state, now on permanent display in the Walton Building at the Waterford Institute of Technology, and in the Killorglin Library, County Kerry.

During Bewick&#x27;s career she illustrated several books and published several books of prints of her paintings. In 2015, at 80 years of age, she published her memoir &quot;80: A Memoir&quot;.

Pauline Bewick died of cancer on 28 July 2022, at the age of 86.

<text>Albert Alonzo &quot;Doc&quot; Ames (January 18, 1842 – November 16, 1911) was an American physician and politician who held four non-consecutive terms as mayor of Minneapolis, Minnesota. His fourth term was marked by multiple prosecutions for political corruption, extortion, and racketeering in a scandal which was publicized nationwide by muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens in a 1903 article in McClure&#x27;s Magazine titled &quot;The Shame of Minneapolis.&quot; Ames was found guilty of corruption, but after a successful appeal and multiple mistrials the charges were dropped. Erik Rivenes, however, has called the downfall of Mayor Ames, &quot;one of the greatest political scandals in Minnesota history.&quot;

==Early life and military service==
Ames was born in Garden Prairie, Illinois on January 18, 1842 to Dr. Alfred Elisha Ames and Martha A. Ames. In 1852, Ames&#x27; family relocated to near Fort Snelling in the Minnesota Territory. At this point the area was still largely undeveloped (they were only the seventh homestead claim made in Minneapolis). Ames attended local public schools which were partially run by the federal government. While attending high school in 1857, Ames became employed as a &quot;printer&#x27;s devil&quot; and a newspaper carrier for the &quot;Northwestern Democrat&quot; (one of the first newspapers in Minneapolis). After graduating from high school in 1858, Ames pursued a career in medicine. Though he received much of his experience and training by observing and working with his father, he attended some classes at Rush Medical College in Chicago and received his M.D. on February 5, 1862.

After graduating with his M.D., Ames returned to Minneapolis intending to start his career as a doctor. After the outbreak of the American Civil War and tensions with the Dakota people began to flare up, Ames enlisted in the 9th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a private in August 1862. Two weeks later, Ames was transferred to the 7th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment and promoted to assistant surgeon. He served with the 7th Minnesota during the Dakota War of 1862 and was present at the execution by hanging of 38 Dakota warriors at Mankato on December 26, 1862.

Ames then served in several battles in the western theater of the Civil War. In July 1864, Ames replaced Lucius B. Smith as surgeon of the 7th Regiment, after the latter was killed in action during the Battle of Tupelo. He was promoted to the rank of surgeon major before mustering out of service in August 1865.

==Medical career==
Following the war, Ames briefly returned to Minnesota to work in the medical field with his father. His popularity among Civil War veterans was such that he was elected to serve in the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1866 on a &quot;soldiers&#x27; ticket.&quot; In 1868, he decided to move west to California. Once there he joined the newspaper business, becoming managing editor of the &quot;Alta California&quot;. Ames remained in California until 1874 when he was summoned home due to his father&#x27;s death.

Ames took over his father&#x27;s medical practice in Minneapolis and developed a reputation as a kind and sympathetic figure. He was well known for treating the poor at no charge and for answering calls at any time of the day. He also served as a firefighter.

In 1886, when Minnesota&#x27;s deadliest ever tornado devastated both St. Cloud and Sauk Rapids, &quot;Doc Ames&quot; arrived at the scene in order to treat the injured. This brought him to nationwide attention.

==Political rise==
Ames became active in the city&#x27;s Democratic party. He served on the Minneapolis City Council in 1875–1876 and was named the city&#x27;s health officer in 1878. He was elected the city&#x27;s mayor three times in 1876, 1882 and 1886. His first term was described as &quot;an indifferent success&quot; but his second and third terms generated accusations of corruption.

Ames was not as successful with his attempts at higher office. During this era Minnesota was heavily dominated by the Republican party and thus Ames faced difficult odds for most state offices. In 1877 he ran unsuccessfully as lieutenant governor. In 1886, he ran for governor but narrowly lost to Andrew Ryan McGill. The narrow margin of victory sparked controversy over who was the actual winner, and the election was contested until Ames decided the effort was not worth the time. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the United States House of Representatives and, at one time, had been under consideration as a candidate for the vice presidency.

Ames was instrumental in the creation of a veteran&#x27;s home in Minneapolis. He initially promoted the idea at the state&#x27;s Democratic convention in 1886. Despite losing the election, the Republican administration accepted his suggestions and authorized the construction of the Minnesota Veterans Home. Ames later served there as a surgeon.

After being defeated in an election for park board in 1888, Ames took a long trip to Europe. Upon returning home, Ames gave an anti-Irish and anti-Catholic interview that outraged Minnesota&#x27;s large Irish-American population and made Ames multiple lifelong enemies. When asked for his, &quot;views about Ireland&quot;, Ames replied, &quot;Well, they have changed. When I left I was prejudiced in favor of Home Rule, but now I do not think the people of Ireland are capable of ruling themselves... I have had plenty of opportunity of studying the Irish question, and I am convinced of one thing, that Ireland is priest-ridden... They are bowed down by superstition and ignorance, and this is to be found wherever the priests are. The priest power of Ireland does not want the people to be educated.&quot;

After Ames&#x27; comments resulted in a firestorm of outraged denunciations by Irish-Americans who had formerly supported him, the Genial Doctor claimed to have received five death threats in letters which promised Ames the same treatment given to Dr. Patrick Henry Cronin. The letters came, Ames alleged, from Roger Vail, the editor of the Minneapolis-based &quot;Irish Standard&quot; newspaper, on behalf of the Irish republican Clan na Gael organization. In response, the Doctor made a lifelong enemy out of Vail, whose &quot;Irish Standard&quot; responded by reprinting editorials from Ames&#x27; many critics among the Minnesota press, who argued that the letters were almost certainly manufactured, &quot;by Ames &amp; Co.&quot;

After losing an independent campaign for mayor in 1898, Ames devised a new strategy. In the 1900 primary election for mayor, he exploited a newly adopted rule which changed the city&#x27;s primary elections to an open primary (allowing voters to vote for candidates in either party). He campaigned for votes as a Republican (knowing the competition was limited) and narrowly won the nomination. He went on to win the general election in 1900. Between his underhanded election strategy and accusations of corruption in his prior administrations, Ames was described as &quot;damned politically, socially and professionally&quot; when he entered office in 1901.

==&quot;The Shame of Minneapolis&quot;==
After entering office, Ames consolidated his power over the city&#x27;s police department (the one area of city government which the mayor had full control over). He fired nearly half of the city&#x27;s officers and replaced them with his political allies, henchmen, and criminals who purchased their badges. As police chief, Ames appointed his brother Colonel Frederick W. Ames, who despite being &quot;a weak, vacillating individual,&quot; had recently commanded an entire regiment of Minnesota soldiers during the Philippine–American War. Norman W. King, a gambler and underworld figure, became the city&#x27;s chief of detectives. Medical student and confidant Irwin A. Gardner was made a special policeman, worked as the Mayor&#x27;s bagman, and was also put in charge of the city&#x27;s vice squad.

Mayor Ames and the Minneapolis police began operating as an organized crime syndicate, extorting protection money and various &quot;fines&quot; from the city&#x27;s illegal businesses. The money collected was turned over to Ames and only small fees were given to his associates. Minneapolis was promoted as an &quot;open city&quot; to criminals across the country and criminals were released from the city&#x27;s jail. Illegal businesses such as opium joints, gambling parlors, and houses of prostitution blossomed, many in the Gateway district. It was speculated that women were setting up candy stores to run a legitimate business to children and workers out front, but providing the services of prostitutes in the back.

After a year in office, Ames&#x27; organization began to swirl out of control. Ames was drinking heavily and the various police and politicians under him began to fight among themselves, withholding money from Ames or developing their own extortion schemes without his approval. Attempts by the Hennepin County sheriff to crack down on the widespread criminal activities were quashed, but even average citizens were aware of the city&#x27;s descent into corruption.

==Prosecution==
In April 1902, a grand jury under the leadership of foreman Hovey C. Clarke began an investigation into the Minneapolis city government and its officials. Clarke was a respected and successful citizen who singlehandedly took on the case, dismissing the county&#x27;s prosecutor when he was unwilling to attack Ames. Clarke paid private detectives, both locally known men and others from out of town, to investigate. After obtaining enough evidence to indict two of Ames&#x27; henchmen, they were convinced to turn state&#x27;s evidence and provide information on others in the organization. By June 1902, indictments has been made against Fred Ames, Gardner and others. Before he too was convicted, Ames fled the city after announcing he has been hired to run a hotel in West Baden, Indiana. He attempted to stay in power from Indiana, but finally announced his resignation as mayor effective September 6, 1902.

As his former allies were tried and indicted, Ames remained on the run. In February 1903, he was arrested at the house of Episcopalian clergyman Rev. C. H. Chapin in Hancock, New Hampshire. Despite a &quot;strong fight on the part of the fugitive,&quot; Ames was extradited to Minnesota and put on trial for receiving a bribe of six hundred dollars from a prostitute. Based on the testimony of his co-conspirators, including his bagman Irwin A. Gardner, Ames was found guilty and sentenced to six years in the Minnesota State Prison at Stillwater. The sentence was overturned on appeal and, after two additional trials ended as mistrials, all legal action against him was ceased.

==Personal life==
In April 1862, Ames married Sarah Strout, the daughter of Captain Richard Strout, who had helped to raise the 9th and 10th Minnesota Infantry Regiments. Emery Washington, a family friend, later recalled, &quot;Richard Strout&#x27;s family consisted of his wife and one daughter, the latter a handsome girl. I remember as well as though it were yesterday the day she was married to Dr. A. A. Ames. I was at the house when they returned from church, and I remarked to Capt. Strout that I had never seen a finer looking couple... A few weeks after the wedding Dr. Ames went to war with his company.&quot;

==Later life==
After the end of the final trial, Ames returned to Minneapolis to practice medicine. He died quite suddenly during the night on November 16, 1911. His obituary in the &quot;Minneapolis Morning Tribune&quot; described Ames as a 33rd degree Scottish Rite Freemason, and a Knight Templar. He was also a member of the Knights of Pythias. After a service inside his home by a Unitarian minister, his body was cremated in Minneapolis&#x27;s Lakewood Cemetery. He left his widow a sum of $1,410.94 and a sum of $1 to each of his surviving children.

==Legacy==
More than a century after his death, the crimes committed by Dr. Ames during his last term as Mayor remain a well-known chapter in the history of organized crime in the Twin Cities.

In his memoir &quot;Augie&#x27;s Secrets&quot;, Twin Cities journalist Neal Karlen concedes that the power temporarily wielded in Minneapolis by Jewish-American organized crime figures like Kid Cann and David Berman beginning in the Prohibition-era gave a major boost to local anti-Semitism, for which Minneapolis became infamous nationwide. Karlen further argues, however, that the pervasive criminality during Mayor Ames&#x27; last term demonstrates that the city of Minneapolis was even more corrupt when Scandinavians and White Anglo-Saxon Protestants were still running it.

<doc id="1256637" wikidata="Q1174684" url="?curid=1256637" title="David Harvey (footballer)">
<text>David Harvey (born 7 February 1948) is a former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Harvey is best known for his 19-year playing career with Leeds United, during which he made over 400 first team appearances. With Leeds he won the 1972 FA Cup final and the league championship in 1974. He was a runner-up in 3 other senior cup finals with Leeds. Harvey gained 16 international caps for Scotland between 1972 and 1976. This included three appearances at the 1974 FIFA World Cup, for which he was voted as goalkeeper of the tournament.

==Playing career==
===Leeds United===
Born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire in 1948, Harvey attended Foxwood School (in the Seacroft area of Leeds), and played for Leeds City Boys before leaving school to work in a Stylo shoe factory. He was signed as a professional footballer by Don Revie in February 1965, after having played as an apprentice for two years.

Harvey was the reserve goalkeeper for Leeds United during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and was on the reserves&#x27; bench when Leeds won the League Cup and the Fairs Cup in 1968, the League championship in 1969, and the Fairs Cup in 1971. Though he did play four times in each of the two Fairs Cup trophy winning seasons.

In the 1970 FA Cup Final, an error by first-choice goalkeeper Gary Sprake allowed opponents Chelsea to equalise in the first half. Sprake was blameless for the second equaliser, but Harvey replaced him for the replay, which Leeds lost 2–1.

In the 1971–72 season, Harvey played only eleven matches, but was selected ahead of Sprake for the 1972 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, as Sprake was suffering from a knee injury. Leeds won 1–0 with an Allan Clarke goal, and from that point on Harvey was the first-choice goalkeeper.

Harvey played 63 times in the 1972–73 season, and played in both the FA Cup Final and the European Cup Winners Cup Final – ending up on the losing side both times. 

Leeds put together a 29-match unbeaten start to the 1973–74 season, winning the League championship and earning Harvey the title medal to which he had not been entitled five seasons earlier.

At the start of the 1974–75 season, Harvey took the last penalty during the shoot-out at the Charity Shield game against Liverpool but missed, thus allowing Liverpool to carry the trophy home. Later in the season Harvey was injured in a car crash. He missed the rest of the season replaced by his understudy David Stewart. Stewart was praised for his bravery and &quot;inspirational saves&quot; beating Anderlecht and F.C. Barcelona in the 1974–75 European Cup. Leeds were beaten 2–0 by Bayern Munich in the final in Paris.

The rest of the 1970s saw Leeds decline after the ageing team Revie built broke up. Harvey left in 1980.

===Vancouver Whitecaps===
Harvey moved to NASL club Vancouver Whitecaps in 1980. He had an unsteady first season with Vancouver, and even though his form improved in the second season in the NASL, but major injuries from another car accident prevented him from regaining his form and place.

===Return to Leeds United===
Harvey returned to Leeds in 1983, by which time the club had been relegated to the old Second Division. By the time he left in 1985, he had played under three of his old teammates: Allan Clarke, Eddie Gray and Billy Bremner. Harvey made over 400 career first team appearances for Leeds.

===Later career===
Harvey played 6 league games for Bradford City in 1985. This was under the management of an ex-Leeds teammate, Trevor Cherry. He then played 3 league games in Scotland for Morton in 1986. He next played non-league football with Whitby Town and Harrogate Town before his retirement from the game aged 37.

===International career===
Harvey made his debut for Scotland in a 2–0 win over Denmark, selected through his Ayrshire raised father. In his 16 full caps he was part of eight victories, four draws and four defeats. He was selected as Scotland&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper for the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany. Harvey only conceded one goal in three games played, but Scotland were eliminated on goal difference after a 2–0 win against Zaire and draws with Brazil (0–0) and Yugoslavia (1–1). He was voted best goalkeeper of the tournament at the 1974 FIFA World Cup.

==Life after football==
He retired from football at the age of 37 years. He managed a public house at Stamford Bridge, near York. He then became a postman, saying, &quot;The sorting office atmosphere was like a dressing room&quot;.

In 1994, with his second wife, June (and their five children), he bought a 150-year-old stone cottage with 10 acres of farmland on Sanday in Orkney. He again worked as a postman. 
On 24 December 2009, he suffered a heart attack, from which he recovered.

In July 2020 Harvey relocated to Lochmaben near Dumfries for greater accessibility to his grandchildren in comparison to Orkney.

<doc id="1256645" wikidata="Q898648" url="?curid=1256645" title="Cycloaddition">
<text>In organic chemistry, a cycloaddition is a chemical reaction in which &quot;two or more unsaturated molecules (or parts of the same molecule) combine with the formation of a cyclic adduct in which there is a net reduction of the bond multiplicity&quot;. The resulting reaction is a cyclization reaction. Many but not all cycloadditions are concerted and thus pericyclic. Nonconcerted cycloadditions are not pericyclic. As a class of addition reaction, cycloadditions permit carbon–carbon bond formation without the use of a nucleophile or electrophile.

Cycloadditions can be described using two systems of notation. An older but still common notation is based on the size of linear arrangements of atoms in the reactants. It uses parentheses: where the variables are the numbers of linear atoms in each reactant. The product is a cycle of size . In this system, the standard Diels-Alder reaction is a (4 + 2)-cycloaddition, the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is a (3 + 2)-cycloaddition and cyclopropanation of a carbene with an alkene a (2 + 1)-cycloaddition.

A more recent, IUPAC-preferred notation, first introduced by Woodward and Hoffmann, uses square brackets to indicate the number of &quot;electrons&quot;, rather than carbon atoms, involved in the formation of the product. In the [&quot;i&quot; + &quot;j&quot; + ...] notation, the standard Diels-Alder reaction is a [4 + 2]-cycloaddition, while the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is also a [4 + 2]-cycloaddition.

==Thermal cycloadditions and their stereochemistry==
Thermal cycloadditions are those cycloadditions where the reactants are in the ground electronic state. They usually have (4&quot;n&quot; + 2) π electrons participating in the starting material, for some integer &quot;n&quot;. These reactions occur for reasons of orbital symmetry in a suprafacial-suprafacial (&quot;syn&quot;/&quot;syn&quot; stereochemistry) in most cases. Very few examples of antarafacial-antarafacial (&quot;anti&quot;/&quot;anti&quot; stereochemistry) reactions have also been reported. There are a few examples of thermal cycloadditions which have 4&quot;n&quot; π electrons (for example the [2 + 2]-cycloaddition). These proceed in a suprafacial-antarafacial sense (&quot;syn&quot;/&quot;anti&quot; stereochemistry), such as the cycloaddition reactions of ketene and allene derivatives, in which the orthogonal set of p orbitals allows the reaction to proceed via a crossed transition state, although the analysis of these reactions as [π2s + π2a] is controversial. Strained alkenes like &quot;trans&quot;-cycloheptene derivatives have also been reported to react in an antarafacial manner in [2 + 2]-cycloaddition reactions. 

Doering (in a personal communication to Woodward) reported that heptafulvalene and tetracyanoethylene can react in a suprafacial-antarafacial [14 + 2]-cycloaddition. However, this reaction was later found to be stepwise, as it also produced the Woodward-Hoffmann forbidden suprafacial-suprafacial product under kinetic conditions.

Erden and Kaufmann had previously found that the cycloaddition of heptafulvalene and N-phenyltriazolinedione also gave both suprafacial-antarafacial and suprafacial-suprafacial products. 
==Photochemical cycloadditions and their stereochemistry==
Cycloadditions in which 4n π electrons participate can also occur via photochemical activation. Here, one component has an electron promoted from the HOMO (π bonding) to the LUMO (π* antibonding). Orbital symmetry is then such that the reaction can proceed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner. An example is the DeMayo reaction. Another example is shown below, the photochemical dimerization of cinnamic acid. The two &quot;trans&quot; alkenes react head-to-tail, and the isolated isomers are called &quot;truxillic acids&quot;.


Supramolecular effects can influence these cycloadditions. The cycloaddition of &quot;trans&quot;-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene is directed by resorcinol in the solid-state in 100% yield.

Some cycloadditions instead of π bonds operate through strained cyclopropane rings, as these have significant π character. For example, an analog for the Diels-Alder reaction is the quadricyclane-DMAD reaction:

In the (i+j+...) cycloaddition notation i and j refer to the number of atoms involved in the cycloaddition. In this notation, a Diels-Alder reaction is a (4+2)cycloaddition and a 1,3-dipolar addition such as the first step in ozonolysis is a (3+2)cycloaddition. The IUPAC preferred notation however, with [i+j+...] takes electrons into account and not atoms. In this notation, the DA reaction and the dipolar reaction both become a [4+2]cycloaddition. The reaction between norbornadiene and an activated alkyne is a [2+2+2]cycloaddition.

==Types of cycloaddition==
===Diels-Alder reactions===
The Diels-Alder reaction is perhaps the most important and commonly taught cycloaddition reaction. Formally it is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction and exists in a huge range of forms, including the inverse electron-demand Diels–Alder reaction, hexadehydro Diels–Alder reaction and the related alkyne trimerisation. The reaction can also be run in reverse in the retro-Diels–Alder reaction.

Reactions involving heteroatoms are known, including the aza-Diels–Alder reaction and oxo-Diels–Alder reaction.

===Huisgen cycloadditions===
The Huisgen cycloaddition reaction is a (2+3)cycloaddition.

===Nitrone-olefin cycloaddition===
The Nitrone-olefin cycloaddition is a (3+2)cycloaddition.

===Cheletropic reactions===
Cheletropic reactions are a subclass of cycloadditions. The key distinguishing feature of cheletropic reactions is that on one of the reagents, both new bonds are being made to the same atom. The classic example is the reaction of sulfur dioxide with a diene.

==Other==
Other cycloaddition reactions exist: (4+3) cycloadditions, [6+4] cycloadditions, [2 + 2] photocycloadditions, metal-centered cycloaddition and [4+4] photocycloadditions

==Formal cycloadditions==
Cycloadditions often have metal-catalyzed and stepwise radical analogs, however these are not strictly speaking pericyclic reactions. When in a cycloaddition charged or radical intermediates are involved or when the cycloaddition result is obtained in a series of reaction steps they are sometimes called formal cycloadditions to make the distinction with true pericyclic cycloadditions.

One example of a formal [3+3]cycloaddition between a cyclic enone and an enamine catalyzed by &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium is a Stork enamine / 1,2-addition cascade reaction:

===Iron-catalyzed 2+2 olefin cycloaddition===
Ironpyridine(diimine)] catalysts contain a redox active ligand in which the central iron atom can coordinate with two simple, unfunctionalized olefin double bonds. The catalyst can be written as a resonance between a structure containing unpaired electrons with the central iron atom in the II oxidation state, and one in which the iron is in the 0 oxidation state. This gives it the flexibility to engage in binding the double bonds as they undergo a cyclization reaction, generating a cyclobutane structure via C-C reductive elimination; alternatively a cyclobutene structure may be produced by beta-hydrogen elimination. Efficiency of the reaction varies substantially depending on the alkenes used, but rational ligand design may permit expansion of the range of reactions that can be catalyzed.

<text>PT Lion Mentari Airlines, operating as Lion Air, is an Indonesian low-cost airline based in Jakarta. Lion Air is the country&#x27;s largest privately run airline, the second largest low-cost airline in Southeast Asia (after AirAsia) and the largest airline in Indonesia. With Wings Air, Super Air Jet and Batik Air, Lion Group is the country&#x27;s largest airline&#x27;s group. The airline operates domestic as well as international routes, which connects different destinations of Indonesia to Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, India, Japan and Saudi Arabia, as well as charter routes to mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Macau, with more than 630 flights per day.

The airline has repeatedly broken records for largest aircraft orders, such as its $24 billion order for 234 Airbus A320 jets. The airline&#x27;s 2011 order of 230 Boeing 737 for $21.7 billion was the largest aircraft order received by Boeing at the time, and the agreement signing was witnessed by President of the United States, Barack Obama.

The airline signed an agreement with US-based aircraft manufacturer Boeing for fifty 737 MAX 10 passenger jets worth $6.24 billion in June 2017. The airline is Boeing&#x27;s second-largest customer (after US-based Southwest Airlines). It had once been criticised for poor operational management in areas such as scheduling and safety, although steps have been taken to improve its safety: on 16 June 2016, the European Union lifted the ban it had placed on Lion Air from flying into European airspace. In June 2018 it attained a positive safety rating following an ICAO audit.

==History==


The airline was established in October 1999 by Rusdi and Kusnan Kirana and started operations on 30 June 2000, when it began scheduled passenger services from Jakarta to Denpasar and Pontianak using a leased Boeing 737-200. It was the first low-cost airline in Indonesia. The fleet was quickly expanded with the wet-lease of five Yakovlev Yak-42Ds, two McDonnell Douglas MD-82s and two sub-leased Airbus A310-300s. Rapid growth enabled modernisation of the fleet with Boeing 737-300 and Boeing 737-400 aircraft. In 2003, a subsidiary airline was established, Wings Air, operating flights on lower density routes. Further subsidiaries were developed including Malindo Air in Malaysia in 2012, Thai Lion Air in Thailand in 2013 and domestically, Batik Air, a full-service subsidiary, also in 2013.

The airline is planning to join the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and therefore hoping to become the second IATA Indonesian member carrier after Garuda Indonesia. Lion Air failed, in early 2011, the initial IATA assessments for membership due to safety concerns. Lion Air and Boeing pioneered the use of required navigation performance (RNP) procedures in Indonesia, having successfully performed validation flights at the two terrain-challenged airports of Ambon and Manado.

From 19 July 2011, Lion Air grounded 13 aircraft due to sanctions caused by bad on-time performance (OTP). The transportation ministry recorded that Lion Air&#x27;s OTP of 66.45 percent was the worst of six airlines in an assessment conducted from January to April 2011 at 24 airports nationwide. On the other hand, airlines using Jakarta airport faced considerable delays to their schedules due to runway congestion.

On 18 November 2011, the airline jointly announced with Boeing a record-setting order of 201 Boeing 737 MAX and 29 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft, setting the record for the world&#x27;s biggest single order of 230 aircraft for a commercial airline worth $21.7 billion.
In January 2012, the Transportation Ministry said that it had sanctioned Lion Air because some of its pilots and crew members were found in recent months to be in possession of crystal methamphetamine. In late 2011, Muhammad Nasri and two other co-pilots were arrested at a party in Tangerang; in early 2012 a pilot was caught with crystal meth in Makassar.
On 4 February 2012, another Lion Air pilot was arrested following a positive urinalysis test for use of methamphetamine; he was scheduled to fly the Surabaya-Makassar-Balikpapan-Surabaya flight hours later. The licenses of the pilots and crew were revoked.

On 18 March 2013, Lion Air signed a contract to purchase 234 Airbus aircraft worth US$24 billion in France and witnessed directly by French President François Hollande. The ordered aircraft are types of A320 and A321.

Lion Air established a full service airline with the name Batik Air, which started operating in 2013 using 737-900ER. Lion Air also signed a commitment with Boeing to order five Boeing 787 Dreamliner for this airline, and this made Lion Air the first Indonesian airline to order this type since Garuda Indonesia canceled its order for the 10 Dreamliners in 2010, and is expected to be sent in 2015. The airline has also considered ordering wide-body aircraft Airbus A330, but chose to buy 787&#x27;s.

On 31 July 2015, Lion Air officially left INACA due to a mismatch with other members.

In June 2016, Lion Group was removed from the list of blacklisted airlines to fly into the EU.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia, Lion Group suspended operations until 1 June. It suspended operations again on 5 June after finding few passengers could provide documents proving they were virus-free and have a business reason or family emergency requiring travel. In July 2020, Lion Group announced that the airline will lay off 2,600 contract workers as demand continues to sharply decline.

===Fleet development and orders===

Lion Air was the launch customer for the largest variant of the Boeing 737, the 737-900ER, for which it placed an order in 2005. On the 2005 Paris Air Show, Lion Air signed a preliminary agreement with Boeing for the purchase of up to 60 Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft, valued at $3.9 billion at list prices. Lion Air confirmed their order in July 2005 and became the launch customer for the Boeing 737-900ER with firm orders for 30 aircraft and options for 30 more, which were later converted into firm orders. The -900ER can carry up to 215 passengers in a single-class layout, and is powered by CFM56-7B turbofan engines. On 27 April 2007, Boeing delivered the first 737-900ER to Lion Air. The aircraft was delivered in a special dual-paint scheme that combines Lion Air&#x27;s logo on its vertical stabilizer and the Boeing &quot;Dreamliner&quot; livery on the fuselage.

Lion Air set a world record when it placed an order for 230 aircraft from Boeing, making this the largest order in terms of aircraft ordered as well the cost of the order. In November 2011, Lion Air and Boeing announced that the airline planned to buy 29 additional Boeing 737 Next Generation and 201 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, with options for 150 more, valued at $21.7 billion at the time. A firm order was signed on 14 February 2012, with the 737 MAX aircraft identified as 737 MAX 9s, making Lion Air the launch customer for that variant. By the time of the signing, the order&#x27;s value had risen to $22.4 billion at list prices, the largest aircraft order in history. Additionally, the engines for the -900ERs, CFM 56-7s, cost about $580 million and the engines for the MAXs, CFM LEAP-1Bs, cost about $4.8 billion. Deliveries of the additional NGs were to start in 2014, with the MAXs to follow in 2017.

On Monday 18 March 2013 Lion Air placed an order for 234 A320 jets with Airbus, the largest single order ever made, surpassing the previous record by Boeing ($22.4 Billion). The contract, which was signed at the Elysée Palace in the presence of President François Hollande and several government ministers, was worth €18.4 billion ($24 billion) at catalogue prices, the French president said.

In April 2018 Lion Air Group placed an order for fifty Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets, valued at a list price of $6.24 billion.

However, following the crash of Flight 610 in October 2018, Lion Air announced that all Boeing orders would likely be cancelled. The statement was further reinforced following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which eventually led to the worldwide grounding of all 737 MAX aircraft currently in service. In the days that followed after Flight 302&#x27;s crash, Bloomberg News reported that Lion Air was evaluating options from Airbus, having already refused to take delivery of a 737 MAX that was going to be delivered in March 2019.

The airline received its first of 10 Airbus A330-900 aircraft on 19 July 2019, becoming the first Asia/Pacific operator of the type.

==Market share==
In the 2000s Lion Air began to grow and became a serious rival for the flag carrier Garuda Indonesia in domestic air travel in Indonesia. By mid 2015, Lion Air led Indonesia&#x27;s domestic air travel market with 41.6 percent share, while Garuda Indonesia came in second with 23.5 percent share. Sriwijaya Air came in third with a market share of 10.4 percent, followed by Garuda&#x27;s low-cost subsidiary Citilink (8.9 percent) and Lion Air&#x27;s regional flight service Wings Air (4.7 percent). Indonesia AirAsia, a unit of Malaysian budget airline AirAsia, had a 4.4 percent market share.

Overall, Indonesian domestic air travel business is overwhelmingly ruled by two airline groups; Lion Air Group and Garuda Indonesia. By mid 2015, Lion Air Group accounted for 43.17 percent of market share, while Garuda Indonesia had 37.08 percent of market share.

From 2005 to 2017, the domestic market share of Lion Air Group increased by more than 100%, from 25% to 51%, while Garuda Indonesia&#x27;s increased from 24% to 33%; their international market share in 2017 was 21% and 39% respectively, while Indonesia AirAsia / Indonesia AirAsia X had 36% of the international market.

==Incidents, accidents and other controversies==
*On 14 January 2002, Lion Air Flight 386, a Boeing 737-200 (registration PK-LID) crashed after trying to take-off with an incorrect flap configuration at Sultan Syarif Kasim II International Airport. Everyone on board survived but the aircraft was written off. This was the first incident involving Lion Air.
*On 30 November 2004, Lion Air Flight 538, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82, crashed in Surakarta with registration PK-LMN (c/n 49189); 25 people died, including the captain.
*On 4 March 2006, Lion Air Flight 8987, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82, crashed after landing at Juanda International Airport. Reverse thrust was used during landing, although the left thrust reverser was stated to be out of service. This caused the aircraft to veer to the right and skid off the runway, coming to rest about from the approach end of the runway. There were no fatalities, but the aircraft was badly damaged and later written off.
*On 24 December 2006, Lion Air Flight 792, a Boeing 737-400 (registration PK-LIJ), landed with an incorrect flap configuration and was not aligned with the runway. The aircraft landed hard and skidded along the runway causing the right main landing gear to detach, the left gear to protrude through the wing and some of the aircraft fuselage to be wrinkled. There were no fatalities, but the aircraft was written off.
*On 2 November 2010, Lion Air Flight 712, a Boeing 737-400 (registration PK-LIQ) overran the runway on landing at Supadio Airport, Pontianak, coming to rest on its belly and sustaining damage to its nose gear. All 174 passengers and crew evacuated by the emergency slides, with few injuries.
*On 13 April 2013, Lion Air Flight 904, a Boeing 737-800 (registration PK-LKS; c/n 38728) from Bandung to Denpasar with 108 people on board, crashed into water short of the runway at Ngurah Rai International Airport while attempting to land. The aircraft&#x27;s fuselage broke into two parts. All passengers and crew were evacuated from the aircraft and there were no fatalities.
*On 9 January 2015, following the fatal crash of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501, 53 routes operated by Lion Air and its subsidiaries were revoked by the transportation ministry as the airline had not been approved to fly. Among the 61 routes, Lion Air had the largest share.
*On 29 October 2018, Lion Air Flight 610, a Boeing 737 MAX 8, crashed in the Java Sea twelve minutes after takeoff from Jakarta. All 189 people on board died. Following the similar crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 less than five months later, the Boeing 737 MAX was grounded.
*In March 2019, former Indonesian transportation safety investigators and a former Lion Air employee claimed that Lion Air had attempted to bribe transportation safety officials, including crash investigators, in at least one case with the knowledge of now-President Director of Lion Air, Edward Sirait.
*In September 2019, Lion Air confirmed that personal data of around 35 million customers had been leaked, including passport details, home addresses, and phone numbers.
*On 16 February 2019, Lion Air Flight 714, a Boeing 737-800, overran the runway at Supadio Airport, Pontianak. All 189 occupants evacuated the aircraft via Escape Slide and Overwing Exit.

<text>In organic chemistry, a sigmatropic reaction () is a pericyclic reaction wherein the net result is one sigma bond (σ-bond) is changed to another σ-bond in an intramolecular reaction. In this type of rearrangement reaction, a substituent moves from one part of a π-system to another part with simultaneous rearrangement of the π-system. True sigmatropic reactions are usually uncatalyzed, although Lewis acid catalysis is possible. Sigmatropic reactions often have transition-metal catalysts that form intermediates in analogous reactions. The most well-known of the sigmatropic rearrangements are the [3,3] Cope rearrangement, Claisen rearrangement, Carroll rearrangement, and the Fischer indole synthesis.

==Overview of sigmatropic shifts==
===Woodward–Hoffman sigmatropic shift nomenclature===
Sigmatropic rearrangements are concisely described by an order term [i,j], which is defined as the of a σ-bond adjacent to one or more π systems to a new position (i−1) and (j−1) atoms removed from the original location of the σ-bond. When the sum of i and j is an even number, this is an indication of the involvement of a neutral, all C atom chain. An odd number is an indication of the involvement of a charged C atom or of a heteroatom lone pair replacing a CC double bond. Thus, [1,5] and [3,3] shifts become [1,4] and [2,3] shifts with heteroatoms, while preserving symmetry considerations. Hydrogens are omitted in the third example for clarity.

A convenient means of determining the order of a given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the atoms of the bond being broken as atom 1, and then count the atoms in each direction from the broken bond to the atoms that form the new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.

In the case of hydrogen atom migrations, a similar technique may be applied. When determining the order of a sigmatropic shift involving a hydrogen atom migration it is critical to count across all atoms involved in the reaction rather than only across the closest atoms. For example, the following hydrogen atom migration is of order [1,5], attained by counting counterclockwise through the π system, rather than the [1,3] order designation through the ring CH2 group that would mistakenly result if counted clockwise.

As a general approach, one can simply draw the transition state of the reaction. For a sigmatropic reaction, the transition state will consist of two fragments, joined by the forming and breaking σ-bonds. The sigmatropic reaction is named as a [&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;]-sigmatropic rearrangement (&quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;j&quot;) if these two fragments consist of &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; atoms. This is illustrated below, with the relevant fragments shown in color.

===Suprafacial and antarafacial shifts===

In principle, all sigmatropic shifts can occur with either a retention or inversion of the geometry of the migrating group, depending upon whether the original bonding lobe of the migrating atom or its other lobe is used to form the new bond.
In cases of stereochemical retention, the migrating group translates without rotation into the bonding position, while in the case of stereochemical inversion the migrating group both rotates and translates to reach its bonded conformation.

However, another stereochemical transition effect equally capable of producing inversion or retention products is whether the migrating group remains on the original face of the π system after rebonding or instead transfers to the opposite face of the π system. If the migrating group remains on the same face of the π system, the shift is known as suprafacial, while if the migrating group transfers to the opposite face is called an antarafacial shift, which are impossible for transformations that occur within small- or medium-sized rings.

==Classes of sigmatropic rearrangements==

===[1,3] shifts===

====Thermal hydride shifts====
In a thermal [1,3] hydride shift, a hydride moves three atoms. The Woodward–Hoffmann rules dictate that it would proceed in an antarafacial shift. Although such a shift is symmetry allowed, the Mobius topology required in the transition state prohibits such a shift because it is geometrically impossible, which accounts for the fact that enols do not isomerize without an acid or base catalyst.

====Thermal alkyl shifts====
Thermal alkyl [1,3] shifts, similar to [1,3] hydride shifts, must proceed antarafacially. Here the geometry of the transition state is prohibitive, but an alkyl group, due to the nature of its orbitals, can invert its geometry, form a new bond with the back lobe of its sp3 orbital, and therefore proceed via a suprafacial shift. These reactions are still not common in open-chain compounds because of the highly ordered nature of the transition state, which is more readily achieved in cyclic molecules.

====Photochemical [1,3] shifts====
Photochemical [1,3] shifts should proceed through suprafacial shifts; however, most are non-concerted because they proceed through a triplet state (i.e., have a diradical mechanism, to which the Woodward-Hoffmann rules do not apply).

===[1,5] shifts===
A [1,5] shift involves the shift of 1 substituent (hydride, alkyl, or aryl) down 5 atoms of a π system. Hydrogen has been shown to shift in both cyclic and open-chain compounds at temperatures at or above 200 ˚C. These reactions are predicted to proceed suprafacially, via a Hückel-topology transition state.

Photoirradiation would require an antarafacial shift of hydrogen. Although rare, there are examples where antarafacial shifts are favored:

In contrast to hydrogen [1,5] shifts, there have never been any observed [1,5] alkyl shifts in an open-chain compound. Several studies have, however, been done to determine rate preferences for [1,5] alkyl shifts in cyclic systems: carbonyl and carboxyl&gt; hydride&gt; phenyl and vinyl» alkyl.

Alkyl groups undergo [1,5] shifts very poorly, usually requiring high temperatures, however, for cyclohexadiene, the temperature for alkyl shifts isn&#x27;t much higher than that for carbonyls, the best migratory group. A study showed that this is because alkyl shifts on cyclohexadienes proceed through a different mechanism. First the ring opens, followed by a [1,7] shift, and then the ring reforms electrocyclically:

This same mechanistic process is seen below, without the final electrocyclic ring-closing reaction, in the interconversion of lumisterol to vitamin D2.

===[1,7] shifts===
[1,7] sigmatropic shifts are predicted by the Woodward–Hoffmann rules to proceed in an antarafacial fashion, via a Mobius topology transition state. An antarafacial [1,7] shift is observed in the conversion of lumisterol to vitamin D2, where following an electrocyclic ring opening to previtamin D2, a methyl hydrogen shifts.

Bicyclic nonatrienes also undergo [1,7] shifts in a so-called walk rearrangement, which is the shift of divalent group, as part of a three-membered ring, in a bicyclic molecule.

===[3,3] shifts===
[3,3] sigmatropic shifts are well studied sigmatropic rearrangements. The Woodward–Hoffman rules predict that these six-electron reactions would proceed suprafacially, via a Hückel topology transition state.

====Claisen rearrangement====
Discovered in 1912 by Rainer Ludwig Claisen, the Claisen rearrangement is the first recorded example of a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. This rearrangement is a useful carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction. An example of Claisen rearrangement is the [3,3] rearrangement of an allyl vinyl ether, which upon heating yields a γ,δ-unsaturated carbonyl. The formation of a carbonyl group makes this reaction, unlike other sigmatropic rearrangements, inherently irreversible.

=====Aromatic Claisen rearrangement=====
The ortho-Claisen rearrangement involves the [3,3] shift of an allyl phenyl ether to an intermediate which quickly tautomerizes to an ortho-substituted phenol.

When both the ortho positions on the benzene ring are blocked, a second [3,3] rearrangement will occur. This para-Claisen rearrangement ends with the tautomerization to a tri-substituted phenol.

====Cope rearrangement====
The Cope rearrangement is an extensively studied organic reaction involving the [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. It was developed by Arthur C. Cope. For example, 3,4-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene heated to 300 °C yields 2,6-octadiene.

=====Oxy-Cope rearrangement=====

In the oxy-Cope rearrangement, a hydroxyl group is added at C3 forming an enal or enone after keto-enol tautomerism of the intermediate enol:

====Carroll rearrangement====
The Carroll rearrangement is a rearrangement reaction in organic chemistry and involves the transformation of a β-keto allyl ester into a α-allyl-β-ketocarboxylic acid. This organic reaction is accompanied by decarboxylation and the final product is a γ,δ-allylketone. The Carroll rearrangement is an adaptation of the Claisen rearrangement and effectively a decarboxylative allylation.

====Fischer indole synthesis====
The Fischer indole synthesis is a chemical reaction that produces the aromatic heterocycle indole from a (substituted) phenylhydrazine and an aldehyde or ketone under acidic conditions. The reaction was discovered in 1883 by Hermann Emil Fischer.

The choice of acid catalyst is very important. Brønsted acids such as HCl, H2SO4, polyphosphoric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid have been used successfully. Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride, zinc chloride, iron(III) chloride, and aluminium chloride are also useful catalysts.

Several reviews have been published.

===[5,5] Shifts===
Similar to [3,3] shifts, the Woodward-Hoffman rules predict that [5,5] sigmatropic shifts would proceed suprafacially, Hückel topology transition state. These reactions are rarer than [3,3] sigmatropic shifts, but this is mainly a function of the fact that molecules that can undergo [5,5] shifts are rarer than molecules that can undergo [3,3] shifts.

===[2,3] shifts===
An example of a 2,3-sigmatropic rearrangement is the 2,3-Wittig rearrangement:

===Walk rearrangements===
The migration of a divalent group, such as O, S, N–R, or C–R2, which is part of a three-membered ring in a bicyclic molecule, is commonly referred to as a walk rearrangement. This can be formally characterized according to the Woodward-Hofmann rules as being a (1, n) sigmatropic shift. An example of such a rearrangement is the shift of substituents on tropilidenes (1,3,5-cycloheptatrienes). When heated, the pi-system goes through an electrocyclic ring closing to form bicycle[4,1,0]heptadiene (norcaradiene). Thereafter follows a [1,5] alkyl shift and an electrocyclic ring opening.

Proceeding through a [1,5] shift, the walk rearrangement of norcaradienes is expected to proceed suprafacially with a retention of stereochemistry. Experimental observations, however, show that the 1,5-shifts of norcaradienes proceed antarafacially. Theoretical calculations found the [1,5] shift to be a diradical process, but without involving any diradical minima on the potential energy surface.

<text>Licetus is a lunar impact crater on the near side of the Moon, in the rugged southern highland region. It lies to the south of the walled plain Stöfler, and is attached to the northern rim of the sub-divided crater Heraclitus. Just to the southeast is Cuvier. Licetus is 75 kilometers in diameter and 3.8 kilometers deep. It is from the Pre-Nectarian period, 4.55 to 3.92 billion years ago.

It is a worn crater formation with several craterlets across its rim and along its inner wall. The most notable of these is a small crater across the inner southeast rim, with another across the northwest rim. The rim is also especially worn along the northern end, with a cluster of tiny craterlets along the rim lip and the inner wall. The interior floor is relatively flat, with some minor ridges and slips in the southern half. There are small craterlets along the floor&#x27;s west-southwest and eastern edges.

The crater is named after Fortunio Liceti, a 17th-century Italian philosopher and physicist.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Licetus.

<text>Marinus is a lunar impact crater that is located near the southeastern limb of the Moon. At this location it is viewed at an oblique angle from the Earth, limiting the amount of detail that can be observed. It lies due north of the slightly larger and dark-floored crater Oken. To the east is the northern part of the Mare Australe.

This is a considerably worn crater, although it retains its generally circular formation. A pair of smaller craters overlies most of the south-southeastern rim. Attached to the northwestern rim is Marinus R, and the crater intrudes into Marinus B to the west. Within the crater, the floor is nearly level and has a slightly lower albedo than its surroundings. The interior surface is marked by a number of tiny craterlets and dimples, as is the rim and inner wall.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Marinus.

<doc id="1256677" wikidata="Q3753903" url="?curid=1256677" title="Fuchsite">
<text>Fuchsite, also known as chrome mica, is a chromium (Cr)-rich variety of the mineral muscovite, belonging to the mica group of phyllosilicate minerals, with the chemical formula .

Trivalent chromium replaces one of the aluminium (Al) atoms in the general muscovite formula producing the apple green hue distinctive of fuchsite. It is often found in minute micaceous aggregates (with individual plates barely visible), as a major component of chromium rich phyllitic or schistose metamorphic rocks of the greenschist facies.

Verdite is a type of metamorphic rock made mostly of an impure, often multicolored, variety of fuchsite. It is used for ornamental carvings.

Fuchsite is named after the German chemist and mineralogist Johann Nepomuk von Fuchs.

==Properties==
Fuchsite crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system. Common colour of the mineral is pale green to emerald green depending on the amount of Cr substitution. The micaceous crystals are flexible and slightly sectile with a hardness of 2-2.5 on the Mohs scale. Fuchsite fluoresces lime green under long wave UV light. Fuchsite&#x27;s radioactivity due to its potassium (K) content is barely detectable.

<doc id="1256678" wikidata="Q1145714" url="?curid=1256678" title="Prime Minister of Ukraine">
<text>The prime minister of Ukraine (, , ) is the head of government of Ukraine. The prime minister presides over the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, which is the highest body of the executive branch of the Ukrainian government. Following the 1991 Declaration of Independence of Ukraine the position replaced the Soviet post of chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR, which was established on March 25, 1946.

Yulia Tymoshenko was the first woman appointed as the prime minister in the history of Ukraine. Arseniy Yatsenyuk was the first prime minister who came from Western Ukraine. Two prime ministers were born in the Russian SFSR.

The current prime minister is Denys Shmyhal, who was sworn in on 4 March 2020 following the resignation of Oleksiy Honcharuk.

==Appointment==
The prime minister is appointed by the president with the consent of the Verkhovna Rada. The consent is deemed granted by the parliament when a simple majority of its constitutional membership votes in favour of the candidate nominated by the president. The highest parliamentary approval to date was received by Yulia Tymoshenko who was appointed the prime minister on February 4, 2005, with 373 votes in the Verkhovna Rada. Other prime ministers who received more than 300 votes were Arseniy Yatsenyuk (371), Yatsenyuk again in 2014 (341) Vitold Fokin (332), and Leonid Kuchma (316).

The procedure of granting consent by the parliament is usually preceded by several days of comprehensive consultations and interviews of the candidate by the parliamentary factions. The approval by the legislature is not a mere formality. Some candidates were ratified by a narrow margin and a candidate may be turned down. For instance, in 1999, Valeriy Pustovoitenko fell three votes short of being re-confirmed after he tendered his resignation at the second inauguration of President Leonid Kuchma in 1999. Kuchma chose Viktor Yushchenko as his alternative candidate. Another example is the approval of Yuriy Yekhanurov&#x27;s candidacy (he fell three votes short of approval, but was confirmed on the second attempt two days later).

After the constitutional amendment of late 2004 and its reinstance in 2014, the president was restricted in their choice of prime minister and was virtually obliged to nominate the person proposed by the parliamentary coalition. The only exception is when the candidate cannot be nominated due to the violation in nomination procedure or the candidate&#x27;s incompliance with the requirements established by the Constitution and the Ukrainian laws for the prime minister. In this case, the president informs the parliament about the impossibility of submitting a nomination for the proposed candidacy.

The prime minister, as with all members of executive branch, cannot be a member of parliament.

==Duties and powers==

The prime minister heads Ukraine&#x27;s executive branch of government, the Cabinet of Ministers, and signs decrees passed by the Cabinet.

The prime minister has the authority to propose candidates for ministry offices to the Verkhovna Rada, with the exception of the minister of foreign affairs and the minister of defence, which are proposed by the president. The prime minister can also propose candidates for the heads of regional administrations to the president for consideration.

The prime minister can also countersign decrees and laws passed by the president. The constitution is silent on the exact regulation of the countersigning. The prime minister (and the respective minister) are responsible for the execution of laws passed by the cabinet.

While in office, the prime minister is granted full legal immunity from all prosecutions and legal proceedings. The prime minister&#x27;s office is headquartered in the Cabinet of Ministries building in central Kyiv. The prime minister was paid a yearly salary of ₴202,776 (16,898/month) (US$26,770) in 2005. In 2013, following a petition in &quot;Fokus&quot; magazine, the secretariat of the cabinet stated that the monthly salary of the prime minister was ₴33,980 (US$4,173.42), which is eleven times more than the average salary in the country.
Prime ministers are frequently asked by individual citizens for help in solving their personal problems, sometimes successfully. In 2012, Prime Minister Azarov received dozens of personal pleas every day on his Facebook page. 
===Acting and vice-prime ministers===
The first vice-prime minister, also known as the first deputy, heads the cabinet in the absence of the prime minister due to resignation or dismissal. Among the most notable First deputies were Yukhym Zvyahilsky and Mykola Azarov, who served as the acting prime minister for a longer period of time than anyone else. Valentyn Symonenko, Vasyl Durdynets, Oleksandr Turchynov, and others also served as acting prime minister.
Apart from the first vice-prime minister, there are also several other vice-ministers who support the prime minister and may be in charge of one or more ministries. In 1991–1992 the office of the state minister was also introduced. Traditionally vice-prime ministers are in charge of an area of general state government policy such as the agro-industrial complex, humanitarian affairs, economic affairs, or regional policy. On certain occasions, those deputies may be given regular ministerial portfolios as well, as happened in the Azarov Government in 2010.

==Dismissal and resignation==
The prime minister, like other Cabinet members, may resign voluntarily by tendering their resignation to parliament (according to the Constitution of Ukraine, the prime minister can only be dismissed by parliamentary vote). Parliament must then consider the matter no later than the 10th day after the resignation application is received, if parliament was not in session at the time of resignation then no later than the first plenary week of the next regular session. A resignation by the prime minister results in the dismissal of the entire Cabinet. After the adoption of the current constitution in 1996, only prime ministers Pavlo Lazarenko and Mykola Azarov have left their post this way. Prime ministers do not have a set term limit, staying in office for the duration of the parliament term, resignation, or dismissal.

Before the constitutional reform of 2004, the prime minister was usually dismissed unilaterally by the president. After the reform, the prime minister can only be dismissed by the parliament. Formally, the Verkhovna Rada needed to pass a resolution of no confidence of the cabinet, which had to result in the prime minister&#x27;s resignation. However, the parliament could not put such a resolution to the vote within one year of the approval of the cabinet&#x27;s official programme. The Cabinets of prime ministers Viktor Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych were dismissed in this way, with the latter refusing to tender his resignation to the president claiming a violation of the one-year period condition. The cabinet of Yuriy Yekhanurov had also been formally dismissed, but the parliamentary act was subsequently repealed.

==List of prime ministers==
Since Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, there have been 18 prime ministers.

Denys Shmyhal is the current prime minister of Ukraine since 4 March 2020.

The longest serving prime minister is Shmyhal; followed by Mykola Azarov (two terms) and Yulia Tymoshenko (who also served two terms).

Tymoshenko was the first (and only) female prime minister of Ukraine.

<doc id="1256681" wikidata="Q3495697" url="?curid=1256681" title="Frankie LaRocka">
<text>Frankie LaRocka (April 17, 1954 – May 12, 2005), born Frank LaRocca, was an American rock musician and producer. He was a member of Scandal, playing drums on their debut EP, and, at various stages, played the drums with Bon Jovi, David Johansen, Bryan Adams, and John Waite. In the 1990s, he became an A&amp;R man and producer with his most notable work being with the Spin Doctors on their breakthrough album &quot;Pocket Full of Kryptonite&quot;.

==Musical history==
LaRocka started his career playing drums with David Johansen on Johansen&#x27;s self-titled album from 1978. He joined Scandal in 1982 and played on their self-titled album of the same year as well as earning credit on John Waite&#x27;s &quot;Ignition&quot; album.

LaRocka toured with Bryan Adams on his 1983 world tour, and was part of the band when they appeared that year live in concert on the televised Rockpalast show (also broadcast live on European radio). Bon Jovi opened for Scandal in a 1984 tour which led to that band&#x27;s signing by Polygram Records. La Rocka played drums on their 1984 &quot;Bon Jovi&quot; album. After parting company with Scandal, he returned to session work playing on sessions by John Waite and in 1985 appearing with him in his band on TV shows like &quot;Solid Gold&quot;. In the early &#x27;90s, LaRocka played drums with Company of Wolves, a straight-ahead rock band signed to Mercury Records.

LaRocka also signed a girl group from London called NeverBlue managed by Christopher Waller, Tasha Leaper, Lisa Hurley and Susan Motley. The group worked with Brian Rawlings, famed for Cher&#x27;s &quot;Believe&quot; album. NeverBlue was signed to Straight Line Records under Atlantic Records.

LaRocka continued to work with NeverBlue after the group disbanded in 2000 and became a girl/boy duo with original member Susan Motley and new addition, Danny Willis.

==A&amp;R and production work==
LaRocka&#x27;s first stab at production was with Irish band Silent Running, whom he signed while working in the A&amp;R department at Atlantic Records. He also played drums on their album &quot;Deep&quot;. He began working for Sony Music and one of his first signings was the Spin Doctors. He produced their 1991 debut &quot;Pocketful of Kryptonite&quot;. The album sold slowly at first but it eventually became a hit after their song &quot;Little Miss Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot; started picking up airplay on MTV and radio. The follow-up single &quot;Two Princes&quot; was a top ten hit and the album reached a peak of #3 on the Billboard charts in 1993. LaRocka produced subsequent albums for the Spin Doctors but they failed to achieve the same success.

LaRocka signed Columbus, Ohio, powerpop band Watershed to Epic Records in 1993. Under his supervision, the band recorded one live EP, &quot;Three Chords and a Cloud of Dust&quot;, and a Jim Steinman-produced album, &quot;Twister&quot;. Neither effort charted and Watershed was dropped from Epic in 1995.

By the end of his career at Sony, LaRocka was vice president of the A&amp;R department. He was back playing drums for a New York band Hot Monkey Love and with Noel Redding on a 2002 live album recorded at Prague. He also had an independent production company, Straight Line Productions, and had signed the band happyendings to J Records where they were recording their debut record.

LaRocka died after undergoing heart surgery in New York in May 2005.

<text>Nightingales (a.k.a. The Nightingales) are a British post-punk/alternative rock band, formed in 1979 in Birmingham, England, by four members of Birmingham&#x27;s punk group The Prefects. They had been part of The Clash&#x27;s &#x27;White Riot Tour&#x27;, recorded a couple of Peel Sessions, released a 45 on Rough Trade and, years after splitting up, had a retrospective CD released by US indie label Acute Records.

Described in John Robb&#x27;s book on &#x27;post punk&#x27; &quot;Death To Trad Rock&quot; as &quot;The misfits&#x27; misfits&quot; and comprising an ever-fluctuating line up, based around lyricist/singer Robert Lloyd, the Nightingales enjoyed cult status in the early 1980s as darlings of the credible music scene and were championed by John Peel, who said of them – &quot;Their performances will serve to confirm their excellence when we are far enough distanced from the 1980s to look at the period rationally and other, infinitely better known, bands stand revealed as charlatans&quot;.

The original members were Robert Lloyd on vocals, Eamonn Duffy on bass and Paul Apperley on drums, all formerly of The Prefects. The band, before splitting up, played more sessions on John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show than any other band excluding The Fall and Half Man Half Biscuit.

In the late 1980s, the Nightingales stopped working but, following the occasional gig between times, they re-grouped in 2004, with Lloyd being joined by original Prefects guitarist Alan Apperley. The current line up features Robert Lloyd, James Smith, Andreas Schmid on bass and ex-Violet Violet drummer Fliss Kitson.

Since restarting the group have been more productive than ever – releasing five 7&quot; vinyl singles, a 10&quot; EP and six studio albums (plus two live albums), touring England, mainland Europe and US numerous times, recording many radio sessions along the way. They have been invited to play various festivals in Europe and the States, including Glastonbury and SXSW. Their &quot;Let&#x27;s Think About Living&quot; 45 was &#x27;Single of the Week&#x27; on BBC 6 and they have continued to receive regular rave reviews for their records and live shows.

A feature-length documentary about the band - &quot;King Rocker&quot; - fronted by comedian and writer Stewart Lee and directed by Michael Cumming was to be released in 2020, but it eventually debuted on the UK Sky Arts channel on 6 February 2021.

==1979–86==
Their debut single, &quot;Idiot Strength&quot; was released in 1981 on Rough Trade, following which Duffy was replaced by Steve Hawkins on bass and Andy Lloyd and Nick Beales joined on guitars.

The band signed to Cherry Red Records and released three more singles before debut album &quot;Pigs on Purpose&quot; (Produced by Richard Strange) was issued in late 1982. John Nester replaced Hawkins on bass before next release, the &quot;Urban Ospreys&quot; single.

Peter Byrchmore replaced Beales (who went on to form Pig Bros) in time for second album, &quot;Hysterics&quot; (1983), Nester then departed to be replaced by Howard Jenner. The new line-up issued two singles in 1985. Further changes then ensued with Andy Lloyd and Paul Apperley leaving, to be replaced by Maria Smith and Ron Collins. The group continued to release singles, record Peel Sessions and tour northern Europe, as headliners and supporting acts as diverse as Bo Diddley and Nico, but after the third album, &quot;In The Good Old Country Way&quot;, the band split up in 1986.

==Post-Nightingales==
After the split, Robert Lloyd formed a new band, Robert Lloyd &amp; The New Four Seasons, who after a few releases on In Tape Records were signed by Virgin Records. Lloyd recorded one solo album for Virgin, &quot;Me and My Mouth&quot;.

Maria and Peter formed The Capitols, later known as The Rotten Swines (Maria was also a member of Rumblefish), Ron Collins joined The Noseflutes, while Andy Lloyd formed Little Red Schoolhouse.

Lloyd is currently active in the reformed Nightingales. Peter Byrchmore plays guitar for The Membranes and Goldblade. Nick Beales is in Church of Elvis and Andy Lloyd is in Del Mar Rey.

Paul Apperley is now a firefighter. John Nester ran a successful greengrocery business, followed by a &#x27;Glastonbury-style&#x27; gift shop in Bridport, Dorset. Now retired from toil, he devotes himself to his friends in Mor or Less, a local folk-rock band. Howard Jenner was last heard of working for Help The Aged. Eamonn Duffy, Maria Harvey (formerly Smith) and Ron Collins still live and work in Birmingham. Steve Hawkins&#x27; whereabouts are unknown.

==The Nightingales re-form==
The band re-grouped in 2004 featuring mainstay/band leader Lloyd, original Prefects guitarist Alan Apperley, ex-Nightingales Byrchmore and Duffy, plus former PWEI drummer Robert &quot;Fuzz&quot; Townshend. This line-up released four 7-inch singles in 2004/5 before Townshend was replaced by Aaron Moore of Volcano The Bear.

Live appearances include radio sessions for Marc Riley&#x27;s Rocket Science on BBC 6 Music, John Kennedy&#x27;s XFM show, Terre T&#x27;s Cherry Blossom Clinic on WFMU (USA) and Another Nice Mess (NL) in addition to gigs around England.

The band also played American music festival South By Southwest in March 2005, alongside dates in Chicago and New York City. The band&#x27;s first American dates ever. Since then they have also played at the Klangbad festival in Germany, organised by Jochen Irmler of Faust, and undertaken a second US tour in March 2007.

After several line up changes since reforming, the group line-up settled, for a while, as Robert Lloyd (vocals), Alan Apperley (guitar), ex-Pram drummer Daren Garratt, &quot;teenage guitar sensation&quot; Matt Wood, and Stephen &#x27;The Night&#x27; Lowe (bass). For a brief July–August 2007 UK and European tour (including a return to the Klangbad Festival on 4 August), Nick Blakey of the Boston, Massachusetts band The in Out substituted for Lowe on bass.

The Nightingales released their first studio album for 20 years in early October 2006; &quot;Out of True&quot; on independent Birmingham label Iron Man Records. A new mini album, &quot;What&#x27;s Not To Love?&quot; was released by Caroline True Records on 30 April 2007.

In 2007 Lowe left the band and after being replaced briefly by Nick Blakey (who appears on the Live in Paris CD) was replaced by John Roberts.

After dates in New York and Boston in March 2008, the group travelled to Faust Studio, Scheer, Germany to record a new album – &quot;Insult to Injury&quot; – for Jochen Irmler&#x27;s Klangbad label. During recording bassist John Roberts left the group. The band played dates in Germany, Switzerland and in Amsterdam, with Christy Edwards of Christy and Emily on bass. Matt Wood left following these dates.

For the remainder of 2008 in to 2009 Edwards moved to guitar and Faust Studio engineer Andreas Schmid joined the band on bass. This line up was augmented on various dates in USA and Germany by U.S avant-garde composer Katherine Young on bassoon and Emily Manzo on keyboards. In June 2009, this Nightingales, minus Young, played the John Peel Stage at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK. The seven piece line up also played several festivals in Germany during Summer &#x27;09 and recorded &quot;The Lost Plot&quot; EP and another album but the album recordings remain unreleased.

In late 2010, Garratt left the group to be replaced by former Violet Violet drummer, Fliss Kitson. Being based in New York also relegated Edwards to an occasional guest Nightingale and guitarist Matt Wood rejoined the band.

A return to Faust Studio in 2011 saw the Nightingales record the &quot;No Love Lost&quot; album, which was released by Cooking Vinyl in early 2012. Described by &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine as &quot;Brilliant. One of the fiercest and most exhilarating rock records in ages&quot;, the record features guests Young on bassoon and Hans-Joachim Irmler on keyboards. Wood left the band for the second time shortly after recording the album and has since joined Telegram. In May 2011, the Nightingales played at The New Adelphi Club in Hull, East Yorkshire.
The new four piece Nightingales – Lloyd, Apperley, Schmid and Kitson – recorded another album &quot;For Fucks Sake&quot; in September 2013 for vinyl LP release in April 2014. The band&#x27;s press statement for this record said, &quot;Having been dumped by their fourth consecutive label, following the release of one album each, the group are self releasing the new LP on their own terms. No interference or outside opinions, no label, no distributor, no catalogue number, no bar code or logo shit, blah blah. &quot;For Fucks Sake&quot; is an 180g vinyl LP, containing twelve songs and came packaged in a beautiful matt varnish gatefold sleeve (&amp; inner bag) featuring five original art works by brilliant Scarborough based artist David Yates.&quot;

The group had a full tour of UK and, for the first time, Ireland in spring 2014, with live shows in Europe and USA over the following year. They recorded a new album &quot;Mind Over Matter&quot; in early autumn 2014, for 2015 release.

After their late autumn 2014 tour, James Smith replaced Apperley in the band.

<doc id="1256689" wikidata="Q1344521" url="?curid=1256689" title="Messala (crater)">
<text>Messala is a lunar impact crater of sufficient dimension to belong to the category of impact features known as walled plains. It is located in the northeastern part of the Moon, close enough to the rim to appear significantly foreshortened. It was named by the IAU in 1935.

Nearly attached to the northern rim is the crater Schumacher. To the southwest is the prominent crater Geminus, and due south is the smaller Bernoulli.

The outer rim of this formation has received a significant amount of erosion due to minor impacts, but much of the outer wall retains its original shape and a certain degree of . The rim is broken by smaller craters along the south, north, and northwest sides, designated Messala B, J, and K, respectively. Messala J has a narrow gouge in its eastern rim leading one crater diameter to the east. It is attached to a slightly larger crater which lies across the southern rim of Schumacher.

The interior floor is relatively level but contains irregularities in the surface at some locations. There are several small craters across the floor, which are now little more than low rims and depressions in the surface. The most notable of these is a ghost crater along the western inner wall.

==Origin of name==
The crater is named after Masha&#x27;allah ibn Atharī (c.740-d.815 AD), a Persian Jewish astrologer and astronomer from the city of Basra (now located in modern-day Iraq) who was the leading astrologer of the late 8th century. Masha&#x27;allah was one of the most prominent members of the commission which decided for Caliph al-Mansur (A.D. 754–775) that the propitious moment for the founding of Baghdad fell on 30 July 762.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Messala.

<doc id="1256692" wikidata="Q375063" url="?curid=1256692" title="Adriana Lecouvreur">
<text>Adriana Lecouvreur () is an opera in four acts by Francesco Cilea to an Italian libretto by Arturo Colautti, based on the 1849 play &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot; by Eugène Scribe and Ernest Legouvé. It was first performed on 6 November 1902 at the Teatro Lirico in Milan.

==Background==
The same play by Scribe and Legouvé which served as a basis for Cilea&#x27;s librettist was also used by at least three different librettists for operas carrying exactly the same name, &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;, and created by three different composers. The first was an opera in three acts by Tomaso Benvenuti (premiered in Milan in 1857). The next two were lyric dramas in 4 acts by Edoardo Vera (to a libretto by Achille de Lauzières) which premiered in Lisbon in 1858, and by Ettore Perosio (to a libretto by his father), premiered in Genoa in 1889. After Cilea created his own &quot;Adriana&quot;, however, none of those by others were performed anymore and they remain largely unknown today.

The opera is based on the life of the French actress Adrienne Lecouvreur (1692–1730). While there are some actual historical figures in the opera, the episode it recounts is largely fictional; its death-by-poisoned-violets plot device is often signalled as verismo opera&#x27;s least realistic. It is often condemned as being among the most confusing texts ever written for the stage, and cuts that have often been made in performance only make the story harder to follow. The running time of a typical modern performance is about 135 minutes (excluding intervals).

==Performance history==
The opera premiered at the Teatro Lirico, Milan, on 6 November 1902, with the well-known verismo soprano in the title role, Enrico Caruso in the role of Maurizio, and the lyric baritone Giuseppe De Luca as Michonnet.

The opera was first performed in the United States by the San Carlo Opera Company on January 5, 1907, at the French Opera House in New Orleans with Tarquinia Tarquini in the title role. It gained its Metropolitan Opera premiere on 18 November 1907 (in a performance starring Lina Cavalieri and Caruso). It had a run of only three performances that season, however, due in large part to Caruso&#x27;s ill-health. The opera was not performed again at the Met until a new production was mounted in 1963, with Renata Tebaldi in the title role. That 1963 production continued to be remounted at the same theatre, with differing casts, for the next few decades. It was in the lead role of this opera that the Spanish tenor Plácido Domingo made his Met debut in 1968, alongside Renata Tebaldi. He sang again in &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; in February 2009.

The title role in &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; has always been a favorite of sopranos with large voices, which tend to sit less at the very top of their range. The part has a relatively low tessitura, going no higher than Bb, and only a few times at that, but requires great vocal power and is challenging to tackle on a dramatic level – especially during the work&#x27;s so-called &quot;Recitation&quot; and death scene. Famous Adrianas of the past 75 years have included Claudia Muzio, Clara Petrella, Magda Olivero, Renata Tebaldi, Carla Gavazzi, Leyla Gencer, Montserrat Caballé, Raina Kabaivanska, Renata Scotto, Mirella Freni, and Joan Sutherland. Angela Gheorghiu tackled the role at the Royal Opera, London, in 2010 with Jonas Kaufmann as Maurizio. It was the first new production (directed by David McVicar) at the Royal Opera House since 1906. Angela Gheorghiu has reprised the role with great critical acclaim, in the same production, at the Vienna State Opera, when the opera was presented for the very first time on its stage (2014), Paris (2015) and again in London, when she celebrated 25 years on the stage of the Royal Opera House and 150 performances with the company (2017) The Met presented a production new to that house by David McVicar on 31 December 2018, with Anna Netrebko in the title role, Piotr Beczała as Maurizio and Anita Rachvelishvili as the Princess de Bouillon.

A recording of part of the opera&#x27;s last act duet &quot;No, più nobile&quot;, rearranged into a self-contained tenor aria, was made by Caruso as early as 1902 for the Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Company in Milan and its affiliates, with Cilea at the piano.

== Roles ==
== Synopsis==
:Place: Paris, France
:Time: 1730

===Act 1===
&quot;Backstage at the Comédie-Française&quot;

The company is preparing for a performance and bustling around Michonnet, the stage manager. The Prince de Bouillon, admirer and patron of the actress Duclos, is also seen backstage with his companion, the Abbé. Adriana enters, reciting, and replies to the others&#x27; praise with &#x27;Io son l&#x27;umile ancella&#x27; (&quot;I am the humble servant of the creative spirit&quot;). Left alone with Adriana, Michonnet wants to express his love for her. However, Adriana explains that she already has a lover: Maurizio, a soldier of the Count of Saxony. Maurizio enters and declares his love for Adriana, &#x27;La dolcissima effigie.&#x27; They agree to meet that night, and Adriana gives him some violets to put in his buttonhole. The Prince and the Abbé return. They have intercepted a letter from Duclos, in which she requests a meeting with Maurizio later that evening at the Prince&#x27;s villa. The Prince, hoping to expose the tryst, decides to invite the entire troupe there after the performance. On receiving Duclos&#x27;s letter, Maurizio cancels his appointment with Adriana, who in turn opts to join the Prince&#x27;s party.

===Act 2===
&quot;A villa by the Seine&quot;

The Princess de Bouillon, not the actress Duclos (who was only acting as her proxy), is anxiously waiting for Maurizio (&quot;Acerba voluttà, dolce tortura&quot;). When Maurizio enters, she sees the violets and asks how he came by them. Maurizio presents them to her, but confesses that he no longer loves her. She deduces that he loves someone else, but soon she&#x27;s forced to hide when the Prince and the Abbé suddenly arrive. Maurizio realizes that they think he is with Duclos. Adriana enters and learns that Maurizio isn&#x27;t a soldier at all, but the disguised Count of Saxony himself. He tells Adriana the assignation was political, and that they must arrange the escape of a woman who is in hiding nearby. Adriana trusts him and agrees to help. During the intermezzo that follows, the house is darkened, and Adriana tells the Princess that this is her opportunity to escape. However, the two women are mutually suspicious, and the rescue attempt turns into a blazing quarrel before the Princess finally leaves. Michonnet, the stage manager, discovers a bracelet dropped by the Princess, which he gives to Adriana.

===Act 3===
&quot;The Hôtel de Bouillon&quot;

The Princess is desperate to discover the identity of her rival. The Prince, who has an interest in chemistry, is storing a powerful poison that the government has asked him to analyze. The couple host a reception, at which guests note the arrival of Michonnet and Adriana. The Princess thinks she recognizes the latter&#x27;s voice, and announces that Maurizio has been wounded in a duel. Adriana faints. Soon afterwards, however, when Maurizio enters uninjured, Adriana is ecstatic. He sings of his war exploits (&quot;Il russo Mencikoff&quot;). A ballet is performed: the &quot;Judgement of Paris&quot;. Adriana learns that the bracelet Michonnet found belongs to the Princess. Realizing that they are rivals for Maurizio&#x27;s affection, the Princess and Adriana challenge each other. When the former pointedly suggests that Adriana should recite a scene from &quot;&quot;, the Prince asks instead for a scene from &quot;Phèdre&quot;. Adriana uses the final lines of the text to make a headstrong attack on the Princess, who swears to have her revenge.

===Act 4===
&quot;A room in Adriana&#x27;s house&quot;

It&#x27;s Adriana&#x27;s name day, and Michonnet is waiting in her home for her to awaken. Adriana is consumed with anger and jealousy. Her colleagues come to visit, bringing her gifts and trying to persuade her to return to the stage. One of these gifts is a diamond necklace, recovered by Michonnet, which Adriana had pawned to help pay off Maurizio&#x27;s debts. A small casket arrives. It contains a note from Maurizio, along with the violets Adriana had given him at the theater. Adriana, hurt, kisses the flowers (&quot;Poveri fiori&quot;) and throws them into the fire. Maurizio enters, hoping to marry her. They embrace, and he notices that she&#x27;s shaking. She quickly becomes deranged, and Michonnet and Maurizio - who&#x27;d presented the violets to the Princess - realize that Adriana has been poisoned. For a moment, she becomes lucid again (&quot;Ecco la luce&quot;), then dies.

==Recordings==
NB. While Maria Callas never played the part of Lecouvreur, she recorded &#x27;Poveri Fiori&#x27; with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Tullio Serafin in 1954.

<text>William Notman (8 March 1826 – 25 November 1891) was a Scottish-Canadian photographer and businessman. The Notman House in Montreal was his home from 1876 until his death in 1891, and it has since been named after him. Notman was the first photographer in Canada to achieve international recognition.

==Biography==

Notman was born in Paisley, Scotland, in 1826. He received a decent education, which included lessons in painting and drawing. He moved to Montreal in the summer of 1856. An amateur photographer, he quickly established a flourishing professional photography studio on Bleury Street, a location close to Montreal&#x27;s central commercial district, where he attracted clients who were members of the political and business elite.

His first important commission was the documentation of the construction of the Victoria Bridge across the St. Lawrence River. The bridge opened with great fanfare in 1860, attended by the Prince of Wales and Notman&#x27;s camera. The gift to the prince of a maple box containing Notman&#x27;s photographs of the construction of the bridge and scenes of Canada East and Canada West so pleased Queen Victoria that, according to family tradition, she named him &quot;Photographer to the Queen.&quot;

Notman&#x27;s status and business grew over the next three decades. He established branches throughout Canada and the United States, including seasonal branches at Yale and Harvard universities to cater to the student trade. Notman was also an active member of the Montreal artistic community; he collaborated with other artists such as Alexander Henderson to sponsor and host art exhibitions in his studio. The studio also provided training for aspiring photographers and painters. 

Notman was highly regarded by his colleagues for his innovative photography, and held patents for some of the techniques he developed to recreate winter within the studio walls. He could simulate the presence of ice and snow in the studio, replicate fire using magnesium flares, and create naturalistic photographs using an innovative composite technique. His professional renown and financial success may largely be attributed to his winter scenes. He won medals at exhibitions in Montreal, London, Paris, and Australia. Notman&#x27;s celebrity was also bolstered by his portraits of famous subjects such as one of Sitting Bull (Sioux name Tatanka Iyotake) and Buffalo Bill (born William Frederick Cody).

Photography during the mid-19th century was not the simple process it later became. The typical tourist generally did not carry a camera and much of the Notman studio&#x27;s images were taken with the tourist&#x27;s needs in mind. Visitors would look through Notman&#x27;s picture books and chose views, to buy individually mounted or perhaps made up into an album, and have a portrait taken as well. Street scenes in the burgeoning cities of Canada, the magnificence of modern transportation by rail and steam, expansive landscapes and the natural wonders, were all in demand either as 8&quot; x 10&quot; print, or in the popular stereographic form, and were duly recorded by the many staff photographers working for the Notman studio.

He was a regular contributor to the photographic journal &quot;Philadelphia Photographer&quot; and in partnership with its editor, Edward Wilson, formed the Centennial Photographic Company for the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, held in honour of the 100th anniversary of the United States in 1876. He won the only gold medal to be awarded by the British judges and the portrait identification card required for entrance to the grounds was the ancestor of today&#x27;s various photo-ID cards.

When William Notman died suddenly in November 1891 after a short bout of pneumonia, management of the studio Wm Notman &amp; Son was left to his son William McFarlane Notman, an experienced photographer in his own right, who with his brothers, had accompanied the itinerant settlement known as &quot;End of Track&quot; for the Canadian Pacific Railway and documented the completion of the railway in Western Canada.

==Legacy==
At Notman&#x27;s death, his eldest son and partner, William McFarlane Notman, inherited the company. When William McFarlane Notman died of cancer in 1913, his younger brother Charles assumed responsibility. In 1935, Charles retired and sold the studio to the Associated Screen News, In 1957, the Notman Collection was purchased by McGill University. The 200,000 negatives, 43 Index Books, 200 Picture Books and assorted memorabilia were transferred to the McCord Museum of Canadian History.

The Notman Photographic Archives was created with the addition of the McCord Museum&#x27;s existing photographic holdings to the Notman Collection, and the Notman Collection served as the kernel for an extensive Canadian photography department, covering Canada from Newfoundland to Victoria, the Great Lakes to the Arctic, from 1841 to 1935.

His residence from 1876 until his death, Notman House in Montreal was added to the Répertoire du patrimoine culturel du Québec historic registry on 8 December 1979.

<text>Nasireddin is a lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged terrain in the southern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. This crater overlaps two older formations, intruding into the crater Miller to the north and Huggins to the west. To the east of Nasireddin is the much larger walled plain Stöfler.

This crater is a younger formation than the two craters it overlies, particularly the worn Huggins to the west. This crater retains much detail, including a d inner wall and a sharp rim to the south and east where the inner wall has slumped. The interior floor is relatively level, but rough-surfaced. There are a few low central peaks near the midpoint of the interior, and a few tiny craterlets to mark the surface.

&#x27;Nasireddin&#x27; has been named after Nasīr al-Dīn Tūsī, a medieval Persian polymath and prominent writer; who is considered to be the greatest of the later Persian scholars. Nasīr al-Dīn Tūsī was an architect, astronomer, biologist, chemist, mathematician, philosopher, physician, physicist, scientist, theologian, and Marja Taqleed (Islamic scholar).

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Nasireddin.

<doc id="1256701" wikidata="Q5319350" url="?curid=1256701" title="Dysbaric osteonecrosis">
<text>Dysbaric osteonecrosis or DON is a form of avascular necrosis where there is death of a portion of the bone that is thought to be caused by nitrogen (N2) embolism (blockage of the blood vessels by a bubble of nitrogen coming out of solution) in divers. Although the definitive pathologic process is poorly understood, there are several hypotheses:

*Intra- or extravascular nitrogen in bones, &quot;nitrogen embolism&quot;.
*Osmotic gas effects due to intramedullary pressure effects.
*fat embolism
*hemoconcentration and increased coagulability.

==Presentation==
The lesion begins as a localised area of infarction, usually without symptoms. Early identification of lesions by radiography is not possible, but over time areas of radiographic opacity develop in association with the damaged bone. Symptomatic lesions usually involve joint surfaces, and fracture where attempted healing occurs. This process takes place over months to years and eventually causes disabling arthritis, particularly of the femoral head (hip).

Dysbaric osteonecrosis lesions are typically bilateral and usually occur at both ends of the femur and at the proximal end of the humerus. Symptoms are usually only present when a joint surface is involved, which typically does not occur until a long time after the causative exposure to a hyperbaric environment. The initial damage is attributed to the formation of bubbles, and one episode can be sufficient, however incidence is sporadic and generally associated with relatively long periods of hyperbaric exposure, and aetiology is uncertain.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is made by x-ray/MRI appearance and has five juxta-articular classifications and forehead, neck, and shaft classifications indicating early radiological signs.

Early on there is flattening of articular surfaces, thinning of cartilage with osteophyte (spur) formation. In juxta-articular lesions without symptoms, there is dead bone and marrow separated from living bone by a line of dense collagen. Microscopic cysts form, fill with necrotic material and there is massive necrosis with replacement by cancellous bone with collapse of the lesions.

The following staging system is sometimes useful when managing lesions.
* Stage 0 - Intravascular coagulation
* Stage 1 - Dead bone without repair
* Stage 2 - Dead bone with repair but without collapse
* Stage 3 - Dead bone with repair and with collapse
* Stage 4 - Secondary degenerative arthritis

In a study of bone lesions in 281 compressed air workers done by Walder in 1969, 29% of the lesions were in the humeral head (shoulder), 16% in the femoral head (hip), 40% in the lower end of the femur (lower thigh at the knee) and 15% in the upper tibia (knee below the knee cap).

It is possible that the condition can worsen even after the initial diagnostic x-ray shows no symptoms, given continued exposure to decompression.

==Prevention==
Prevention is a more successful strategy than treatment. By using the most conservative decompression schedule reasonably practicable, and by minimizing the number of major decompression exposures, the risk of DON may be reduced. Prompt treatment of any symptoms of decompression sickness (DCS) with recompression and hyperbaric oxygen also reduce the risk of subsequent DON.

==Treatment==

Treatment is difficult, often requiring a joint replacement. Spontaneous improvement occasionally happens and some juxta-articular lesions do not progress to collapse. Other treatments include immobilization and osteotomy of the femur. Cancellous bone grafts are of little help.

==Prognosis==
If the diver has not been exposed to excessive depth and decompression and presents as DON, there may be a predisposition for the condition. Diving should be restricted to shallow depths. Divers who have suffered from DON are at increased risk of future fracture of a juxta-articular lesion during a dive, and may face complications with future joint replacements. Because of the young age of the population normally affected, little data is available regarding joint replacement complications.

There is the potential for worsening of DON for any diving where there might be a need for decompression, experimental or helium diving. Physically stressful diving should probably be restricted, both in sport diving and work diving due to the possibility of unnecessary stress to the joint. Any diving should be less than 40 feet/12 meters. These risks are affected by the degree of disability and by the type of lesion (juxta-articular or shaft).
==Prevalence==
Dysbaric osteonecrosis is a significant occupational hazard, occurring in 50% of commercial Japanese divers, 65% of Hawaiian diving fishermen and 16% of commercial and caisson divers in the UK.
Its relationship to compressed air is strong in that it may follow a single exposure to compressed air, may occur with no history of DCS but is usually associated with significant compressed air exposure. The distribution of lesions differs with the type of exposure - the juxta-articular lesions being more common in caisson workers than in divers.
There is a definite relationship between length of time exposed to extreme depths and the percentage of divers with bone lesions. Evidence does not suggest that dysbaric osteonecrosis is a significant risk in recreational scuba diving.

<text>John Lawrence Whitty, Baron Whitty, (born 15 June 1943), known as Larry Whitty, is a British Labour Party politician.

==Early life==
Born in 1943, Whitty was educated at Latymer Upper School and graduated from St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, with a BA (Hons) degree in Economics. He worked for Hawker Siddeley Aviation from 1960 to 1962 and at the Ministry of Aviation Technology from 1965 to 1970.

==Career==
===Trade unions===
He was employed by the Trades Union Congress from 1970 to 1973 and the General Municipal Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union from 1973 to 1985.

===The Labour Party===
In 1985, Whitty became the General Secretary of the Labour Party, a post he held until 1994. He was part of the reforming leadership of Neil Kinnock; in the role progressed a wide-ranging agenda including the modification of internal rules, a shift towards a national membership scheme, the expulsion of entryist Militant group members and, following the 1987 election defeat, the internal Policy Review. Whitty&#x27;s period as General Secretary meant that he oversaw two general elections (the later in 1992), and the election of John Smith and Tony Blair as leaders of the party. He was the European Co-ordinator for the Labour Party from 1994 to 1997.

===Peerage===
Whitty was created a life peer on 21 October 1996 as Baron Whitty, &quot;of Camberwell in the London Borough of Southwark&quot;. From July 1998, Whitty was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions with responsibility for roads and road safety issues. From 1997 Lord Whitty was a Lord-in-Waiting (Government Whip) covering education and foreign affairs. He became Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at DEFRA with responsibility for Farming, Food and Sustainable Energy in June 2001, serving in this position until the general election of May 2005.

===Consumer Focus===
Whitty was appointed as the first Chairman of Consumer Focus in July 2007. Consumer Focus was created through the merger of three organisations – energywatch, Postwatch and the National Consumer Council (including the Scottish and Welsh Consumer Councils) – by the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007.

==Personal life==
Whitty is married, with two sons from a previous marriage. He is the brother of Geoff Whitty, a former director of the Institute of Education, London University.

<doc id="1256704" wikidata="Q1077970" url="?curid=1256704" title="Christ Church Greyfriars">
<text>Christ Church Greyfriars, also known as Christ Church Newgate Street, was a church in Newgate Street, opposite St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in the City of London. Established as a monastic church in the thirteenth century, it became a parish church after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Following its destruction in the Great Fire of London of 1666, it was rebuilt to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren. Except for the tower, the church was largely destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. The decision was made not to rebuild the church; the ruins are now a public garden.

==History==

===Gothic church===
Christ Church Greyfriars had its origins in the conventual church of a Franciscan monastery, the name &#x27;Greyfriars&#x27; being a reference to the grey habits worn by Franciscan friars. The first church on the site was built in the mid-thirteenth century, but this was soon replaced by a much larger building, begun in the 1290s and finished in about 1360. This new church was the second largest in medieval London, measuring long and wide, with at least eleven altars. It was built partly at the expense of Marguerite of France, second wife of King Edward I. She was buried at the church, as was Isabella, widow of Edward II and her daughter Joan of the Tower, Queen of Scotland. The heart of Eleanor of Provence, wife of Henry III, was also interred there.

Richard Whittington, Lord Mayor of London, founded a library in connection with the church in 1429.

The monastery was dissolved in 1538 during the English Reformation. The building and fittings suffered heavy damage in this period. Tombs disappeared, sold for their marble and other valuable materials; monuments were defaced. In 1546, Henry VIII gave the priory and its church, along with the churches of St Nicholas Shambles and St Ewin, Newgate Market, to the City Corporation. A new parish of Christ Church was created, incorporating those of St Nicholas and St Ewin, and part of that of St Sepulchre. The priory buildings later housed Christ&#x27;s Hospital school, founded by Edward VI, and the church became its pupils&#x27; principal place of worship.

In the 1640s, Christ Church was the church of the Presbyterian polemicist Thomas Edwards, and during May 1647 became a centre of operations for attempts to disband and pay arrears to members of the New Model Army.

===Wren&#x27;s church===
The medieval church was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666. Reconstruction was assigned to Wren, who oversaw a decades long programme to rebuild St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and approximately 50 parish churches. There appears to have been some debate about the form the new Christ Church should take. A surviving unused design shows a structure considerably larger than the one eventually built.

The parish was united with that of St Leonard, Foster Lane, which was not rebuilt

Parishioners raised £1,000 to begin work on the design. To save time and money, the foundations of the gothic church were partially reused. The new church and tower (without steeple) were completed in 1687, at a total cost of £11,778 9s. 7¼d. Smaller than the gothic structure, the building measured long and wide, occupying only the eastern end of the site of the medieval church, the western part becoming its churchyard.

The tower, rising from the west end of the church, had a simple round-arched main entranceway and, above, windows decorated with neoclassical pediments. Large carved pineapples, symbols of welcome, graced the four roof corners of the main church structure. Unique among the Wren churches, the east and west walls had buttresses.
The interior was divided into nave and aisles by Corinthian columns, raised on tall plinths so that their bases were level with the gallery floors. The aisles had flat ceilings, while the nave had a shallow cross-vault. The north and south walls had large round-arched windows of clear glass, which allowed for a brightly lit interior. The east end had trinity windows, a large wooden altar screen and a carved hexagonal pulpit, reached by stairs. There was elaborate carved wainscoting. A pavement of reddish brown and grey marble to the west of the altar rails was said to date from the original gothic church. Galleries stood over the north and south aisles, built at special request of the officers of Christ&#x27;s Hospital as seating for the school&#x27;s students. Pews were said to have been made from the timbers of a wrecked Spanish galleon. The organ, on the west wall over the main nave door, was built by Renatus Harris in 1690, according to a pre-war guide to the church.

The steeple, standing about tall, was finished in 1704 at an additional cost of £1,963, 8s. 3½ d. It has three diminishing storeys, square in plan, the middle one with a freestanding Ionic colonnade.

Over the course of the church’s existence, significant modifications were made. In 1760, a vestry house was built against the facade’s south side and part of the church&#x27;s south wall. At some point, rooms were enclosed in the north and south aisles beneath the galleries. Stained glass depicting Jesus with the children was installed in the centre trinity window to replace the original clear glass.

The church functioned as an important centre of City of London society and music. The Lord Mayor attended an annual service to hear the Ancient Spital Sermon on the second Wednesday after Easter, placing his ceremonial sword in a special holder. Felix Mendelssohn played Bach&#x27;s A minor fugue and other works on the organ in 1837. Samuel Wesley also performed at the church.

The Christ&#x27;s Hospital boys continued to attend services, sitting in the galleries. According to the pre-war guide book to the church, they included the young Samuel Coleridge and Charles Lamb. Sixth Form boys tasked with maintaining order sat in special seats placed over those of the younger students. A few boys carved initials in the woodwork.

===Decline of the congregation===
In 1902, Christ&#x27;s Hospital moved out of the City to Horsham, West Sussex, ending the Sunday influx of its schoolboys. A new vicar, T.R. Hine-Haycock, took over in 1912. A July 1922 Christ Church newsletter preserved at Guildhall Library shows that at that time it had an 8:30 a.m. Holy Communion service every Sunday, and musical services at 11 a.m. every first and third Sunday.The church was open daily for private prayer from noon to 3 p.m. In its final years, the congregation continued to drop in size, a common trend for City churches as people relocated to suburban neighbourhoods of London. Parish records at the Guildhall Library show there were 112 members in April 1933, mostly residents of places outside the parish boundaries. Many of those who made their homes in the parish were &quot;housekeepers&quot;, people who lived in and looked after commercial buildings. In April 1937, the membership had dropped to 77.

===Destruction===
The church was severely damaged in the Blitz on 29 December 1940. During one of the Second World War&#x27;s fiercest air raids on London, a firebomb struck the roof and tore into the nave. Much of the surrounding neighbourhood was also set alight—a total of eight Wren churches burned that night. At Christ Church, the only fitting known to have been saved was the cover of the finely carved wooden font, recovered by an unknown fireman who ran inside as the flames raged. The roof and vaulting collapsed into the nave; the tower and four main walls, made of stone, remained standing but were smoke-scarred and gravely weakened. A photograph taken the following day shows two firemen hosing down smouldering rubble in the nave.
===Post-war period===
In 1944, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote about the ruins of Christ Church 

In 1949, in a reorganisation of Church of England parishes in London, authorities decided not to rebuild Christ Church. The remains of the church were designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. In 1954, the Christ Church parish was merged with that of the nearby St Sepulchre-without-Newgate.

The steeple, still standing after the wartime damage, was disassembled in 1960 and put back together using modern construction methods. The surviving lower part of the south wall and the entire east wall were demolished in 1962 to make way for a widening of King Edward Street. In 1981, neo-Georgian brick offices were constructed against the southwest corner of the ruins, in imitation of the 1760 vestry house that had stood there. In 1989, the former nave area became a public garden and memorial. The tower&#x27;s lower levels functioned as commercial rental space.

In 2002, the financial firm Merrill Lynch completed a regional headquarters complex on land abutting to the north and the west. In conjunction with that project, the Christ Church site underwent a major renovation and archeological examination, King Edward Street was returned to its former course, and the site of the church regained its pre-war footprint. The churchyard was spruced up and its metal railings restored. In 2006, work was completed to convert the tower and spire into a modern twelve-level private residence. The nave area continues as a memorial; the wooden font cover, topped by a carved angel, can today be seen in the porch of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate.

<text>Leopoldine Rysanek (14 November 1926 – 7 March 1998) was an Austrian dramatic soprano.

== Life ==

Rysanek was born in Vienna as one of six children of a Czech father and an Austrian mother. She entered the Vienna Academy at 16, where she studied with Alfred Jerger. Rysanek made her operatic debut in 1949 in Innsbruck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kutsch/Riemens&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1951, the Bayreuth Festival reopened and the new leader Wieland Wagner asked her to sing Sieglinde in &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, conducted by Herbert von Karajan. He was convinced that her unique, young and beautiful voice, combined with her rare acting abilities, would create a sensation. She became a star overnight, and the role of Sieglinde followed her for the rest of her career. Her final performance was at the Salzburg Festival in August 1996, as Klytämnestra in &quot;Elektra&quot; by Richard Strauss.

She made her American debut at the San Francisco Opera on 18 September 1956 in &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot;, the first of her nineteen roles in San Francisco. Other operas were &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Turandot&quot;, &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;Salome&quot; (Salome and Herodias), &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;, &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, &quot;Lohengrin&quot; (Elsa and Ortrud), &quot;Jenůfa&quot; (Kostelnička), and &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; (the Countess). Her last San Francisco performance was on 12 December 1993.

Her Metropolitan Opera debut came in 1959 as Lady Macbeth in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, replacing Maria Callas who had been &quot;fired&quot; from the production. Over her lengthy career, she sang 299 performances in 24 roles there. She starred in productions of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Nabucco&quot;, in the title role of &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; by Richard Strauss, the Empress in &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;, also by Strauss, and Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot;. She made her farewell there as the Countess in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; in January 1996.

She was appointed curator of the Vienna Festival a few months after her retirement, a post she held until her death in Vienna at age 71 (she had been diagnosed with bone cancer during her last Met performances). Two days later, a Metropolitan Opera production of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; with Ben Heppner in the title role was dedicated to her memory. In that opera, she had sung the role of Ortrud in the 1985–86 production.

==Voice and roles==

Rysanek was known for singing the music of Richard Strauss. She was especially praised as the Empress (Kaiserin) in &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;, the title role in &quot;Salome&quot;, the Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and Chrysothemis in &quot;Elektra&quot;. She occasionally sang Ariadne/Prima Donna in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; and female leads in Strauss operas rarely staged (&quot;Die ägyptische Helena&quot; and &quot;Die Liebe der Danae&quot;). However, cautious of playing out of her league, she did not tackle &quot;Salome&quot; until 1972 when she was age 46, although she kept the role of Sieglinde in her active repertoire from her early 20s until age 62. 

She avoided offers to sing Isolde in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; despite speculation that the role would be perfect for her. She sang Brünnhilde in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; in 1950 in Innsbruck but did not return to this role. One of her performances in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; took place in the same week as her appearance as Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;.

Rysanek sang the title role of &quot;Tosca&quot; often, and &quot;Turandot&quot; a few times. She also sang Leonore in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;. In Wagner, she sang Elisabeth in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; often, also Elsa and Ortrud in &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. The role in which she was most revered, in addition to Strauss&#x27;s Kaiserin and Chrysothemis, was Sieglinde in &quot;Die Walküre&quot;.

Due to Rysanek&#x27;s vocal technique and strong vocal endurance, she was able to sing many Verdi leads, notably Desdemona in &quot;Otello&quot;, Lady Macbeth, Amelia in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, Elisabetta in &quot;Don Carlo&quot;, Leonora in &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, and the title role of &quot;Aida&quot;. She also sang Abigaille in the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s first staging of &quot;Nabucco&quot; in 1960. Rysanek also took an interest in Czech opera (Smetana, Janáček), even though she didn&#x27;t grow up speaking Czech at home.

Rysanek sang Turandot and was praised in her role of Kundry in &quot;Parsifal&quot; at the Met, Vienna, and the Bayreuth Festival. She started her career when Kirsten Flagstad was still alive and Birgit Nilsson and Astrid Varnay at the peak of their vocal abilities. In 1981, Karl Böhm persuaded her to sing &quot;Elektra&quot; for a Unitel film (with the soundtrack recorded in the studio), not a live production in an opera house. In her later years, Rysanek reverted to dramatic mezzo-soprano roles like Herodias in &quot;Salome&quot;, Klytemnestra in &quot;Elektra&quot; and Kostelnička in Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Jenůfa&quot;.

Soprano Lotte Rysanek was Leopoldine Rysanek&#x27;s sister.

<text>Vlacq is a prominent lunar impact crater that is located in the southeastern part of the Moon, and appears foreshortened when viewed from the Earth. This crater is adjacent to the northeastern rim of the larger Hommel, and to the northwest rim of Rosenberger.

This crater has become eroded, but not to the degree of the larger neighboring craters. The satellite crater Vlacq G intrudes into the southern rim of Vlacq, and is overlaid in turn along the southwest rim by the sharp-rimmed Vlacq B. The satellite crater Vlacq C is attached to the northeastern exterior rim of Vlacq.

The interior floor of Vlacq has been resurfaced by lava, leaving a nearly level base. The southwest half of the floor, however, is overlaid by ejecta from nearby impacts. In the midpoint of the floor is a rounded massif that is about 15 kilometers in length, being long along the northwest direction. The floor contains a number of tiny craterlets as well as several ghostly crater remnants in the western half. The most notable of these is a circular depression to the west of the central peak.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Vlacq.

<doc id="1256713" wikidata="Q1423517" url="?curid=1256713" title="Diving medicine">
<text>Diving medicine, also called undersea and hyperbaric medicine (UHB), is the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of conditions caused by humans entering the undersea environment. It includes the effects on the body of pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how aspects of a diver&#x27;s fitness to dive affect the diver&#x27;s safety. Diving medical practitioners are also expected to be competent in the examination of divers and potential divers to determine fitness to dive.

Hyperbaric medicine is a corollary field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber is used as a treatment for two of the most significant diving-related illnesses, decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism.

Diving medicine deals with medical research on issues of diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accidents and diving fitness. The field includes the effect of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure on the human body and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety.

In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications.

Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and at first aid level, an important part of diver education.

== Range and scope of diving medicine ==

The scope of diving medicine must necessarily include conditions that are specifically connected with the activity of diving, and not found in other contexts, but this categorization excludes almost everything, leaving only deep water blackout, isobaric counterdiffusion and high pressure nervous syndrome. A more useful grouping is conditions that are associated with exposure to variations of ambient pressure. These conditions are largely shared by aviation and space medicine. Further conditions associated with diving and other aquatic and outdoor activities are commonly included in books which are aimed at the diver, rather than the specialist medical practitioner, as they are useful background to diver first aid training.

The scope of knowledge necessary for a practitioner of diving medicine includes the medical conditions associated with diving and their treatment, physics and physiology relating to the underwater and pressurised environment, the standard operating procedures and equipment used by divers which can influence the development and management of these conditions, and the specialised equipment used for treatment.

== Diagnostics ==

The signs and symptoms of diving disorders may present during a dive, on surfacing, or up to several hours after a dive. Divers have to breathe a gas which is at the same pressure as their surroundings, which can be much greater than on the surface. The ambient pressure underwater increases by for every of depth.

The principal conditions are: decompression illness (which covers decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism); nitrogen narcosis; high pressure nervous syndrome; oxygen toxicity; and pulmonary barotrauma (burst lung). Although some of these may occur in other settings, they are of particular concern during diving activities.

The disorders are caused by breathing gas at the high pressures encountered at depth, and divers will often breathe a gas mixture different from air to mitigate these effects. Nitrox, which contains more oxygen and less nitrogen is commonly used as a breathing gas to reduce the risk of decompression sickness at recreational depths (up to about ). Helium may be added to reduce the amount of nitrogen and oxygen in the gas mixture when diving deeper, to reduce the effects of narcosis and to avoid the risk of oxygen toxicity. This is complicated at depths beyond about , because a helium–oxygen mixture (heliox) then causes high pressure nervous syndrome. More exotic mixtures such as hydreliox, a hydrogen–helium–oxygen mixture, are used at extreme depths to counteract this.

=== Decompression sickness ===

Decompression sickness (DCS) occurs when gas, which has been breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues, forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers.

=== Pulmonary barotrauma and arterial gas embolism ===
If the breathing gas in a diver&#x27;s lungs cannot freely escape during an ascent, the lungs may be expanded beyond their compliance, and the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary barotrauma (PBT). The gas may then enter the arterial circulation producing arterial gas embolism (AGE), with effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms.

=== Nitrogen narcosis ===

Nitrogen narcosis is caused by the pressure of dissolved gas in the body and produces temporary to the nervous system. This results in alteration to thought processes and a decrease in the diver&#x27;s ability to make judgements or calculations. It can also decrease motor skills, and worsen performance in tasks requiring manual dexterity. As depth increases, so does the pressure and hence the severity of the narcosis. The effects may vary widely from individual to individual, and from day to day for the same diver. Because of the perception-altering effects of narcosis, a diver may not be aware of the symptoms, but studies have shown that impairment occurs nevertheless. The narcotic effects dissipate without lasting effect as the pressure decreases during ascent.

=== High-pressure nervous syndrome ===

Helium is the least narcotic of all gases, and divers may use breathing mixtures containing a proportion of helium for dives exceeding about deep. In the 1960s it was expected that helium narcosis would begin to become apparent at depths of . However, it was found that different symptoms, such as tremors, occurred at shallower depths around . This became known as high-pressure nervous syndrome, and its effects are found to result from both the absolute depth and the speed of descent. Although the effects vary from person to person, they are stable and reproducible for the individual.

=== Oxygen toxicity ===

Although oxygen is essential to life, in concentrations significantly greater than normal it becomes toxic, overcoming the body&#x27;s natural defences (antioxidants), and causing cell death in any part of the body. The lungs and brain are particularly affected by high partial pressures of oxygen, such as are encountered in diving. The body can tolerate partial pressures of oxygen around indefinitely, and up to for many hours, but higher partial pressures rapidly increase the chance of the most dangerous effect of oxygen toxicity, a convulsion resembling an epileptic seizure. Susceptibility to oxygen toxicity varies dramatically from person to person, and to a smaller extent from day to day for the same diver. Prior to convulsion, several symptoms may be present – most distinctly that of an aura.

== Treatments ==
Treatment of diving disorders depends on the specific disorder or combination of disorders, but two treatments are commonly associated with first aid and definitive treatment where diving is involved. These are first aid oxygen administration at high concentration, which is seldom contraindicated, and generally recommended as a default option in diving accidents where there is any significant probability of hypoxia, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is the definitive treatment for most conditions of decompression illness.

=== Oxygen therapy ===

The administration of oxygen as a medical intervention is common in diving medicine, both for first aid and for longer term treatment.
Normobaric oxygen administration at the highest available concentration is frequently used as first aid for any diving injury that may involve inert gas bubble formation in the tissues. There is epidemiological support for its use from a statistical study of cases recorded in a long term database.

=== Recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy ===

Recompression treatment in a hyperbaric chamber was initially used as a life-saving tool to treat decompression sickness in caisson workers and divers who stayed too long at depth and developed decompression sickness. In the 21st century, it is a highly specialized treatment modality found to be effective for treating many conditions where the administration of oxygen under pressure is beneficial.

Hyperbaric oxygen treatment is generally preferred when effective, as it is usually a more efficient and lower risk method of reducing symptoms of decompression illness, but in some cases recompression to pressures where oxygen toxicity is unacceptable may be required to eliminate the bubbles in the tissues in severe cases of decompression illness.

Availability of recompression treatment is limited. Some countries have no facilities at all, and in others which have facilities, such as the US, some hospitals do not make them available for emergency treatment.

==Medical examination for fitness to dive==

Fitness to dive, (or medical fitness to dive), is the medical and physical suitability of a person to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver that he or she does not suffer from any of the listed disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, to a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a procedural checklist, and a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner.

The most important medical examination is the one before starting diving, as the diver can be screened to prevent exposure when a dangerous condition exists and a baseline established. The other important medicals are after some significant illness, where medical intervention is needed and has to be done by a doctor who is competent in diving medicine, and can not be done by prescriptive rules.

Psychological factors can affect fitness to dive, particularly where they affect response to emergencies, or risk taking behaviour. The use of medical and recreational drugs, can also influence fitness to dive, both for physiological and behavioural reasons. In some cases prescription drug use may have a net positive effect, when effectively treating an underlying condition, but frequently the side effects of effective medication may have undesirable influences on the fitness of diver, and most cases of recreational drug use result in an impaired fitness to dive, and a significantly increased risk of sub-optimal response to emergencies.

== Education and registration of practitioners ==
Specialist training in underwater and hyperbaric medicine is available from several institutions, and registration is possible both with professional associations and governmental registries.

=== Education ===

====National Board of Diving and Hyperbaric Medical Technology====

The National Board of Diving and Hyperbaric Medical Technology (NBDHMT), formally known as the National Association of Diving Technicians, is a non-profit organization for the education and certification of qualified personnel in the fields of diving and hyperbaric medicine in the US.
* The Diver Medic Technician (DMT) program is designed to meet the specific medical care needs of commercial, professional and scientific divers that often work in geographic isolation. DMT&#x27;s are specifically trained for the various diving hazards found at remote work sites. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics from barotrauma to treatment of decompression sickness.
* The Certified Hyperbaric Technologist (CHT) program is tailored to meet the specific safety and operational needs for biomedical devices within the department, and the necessary knowledge and skills to administer clinical treatment. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics including hyperbaric chamber operations to transcutaneous oxygen monitoring.
* The Certified Hyperbaric Registered Nurse (CHRN) program is a subspecialty for registered nurses, sometimes referred to as baromedical nurses.

====NOAA/UHMS Physicians Training Course in Diving Medicine====
This course has been presented since 1977, and has been influenced by internationally accepted training objectives recommended by the Diving Medical Advisory Committee, the European Diving Technology Committee, and the European Committee for Hyperbaric Medicine. The course is designed for qualified medical practitioners, but may be useful to others who work in the field of diving safety and operations.

The course is to train physicians to recognize and treat diving medical emergencies. Subject matter includes:
* Basic physics and physiology of the hyperbaric environment:
** the laws and principles;
** the differences between hyperbaric and hypobaric pressure;
** hyperbaric gases and their effects under pressure;
** links between the physiological effects of the hyperbaric environment and the pathology of the disease

* The clinical application of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and the treatment tables used;
* Participation in surface-supplied diving operation and hyperbaric chamber operations;
* Components, types, operational and safety hazards associated with hyperbaric chambers;
* Diving-related conditions resulting from the short and long-term effects of diving, flying after diving, altitude, thermal conditions, age and gender
* Neurologic assessment on a diver with signs and/or symptoms of DCI
* Medical and fitness standards for diving, including:
** contraindications for both commercial and recreational divers
** differences in medical standards for recreational versus occupational diving communities
** legal implications for approving and denying fitness to dive in an occupational setting
** approaches for determining the safety of prescription and OTC medications used by divers

====Fellowship in Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine====
The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) offer 12-month programs in undersea and hyperbaric medicine associated with ACGME or AOA accredited programs in emergency medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, occupational medicine, preventive medicine, or anesthesiology.

====ECHM-EDTC Educational and Training Standards ====
The standard drawn up jointly by the European Committee for Hyperbaric Medicine and the European Diving Technical Committee defines job descriptions for several levels of diving and hyperbaric physician: Education and assessment to these standards may be provided by institutions of higher education under the leadership of a Level 3 Hyperbaric Medicine Expert as defined below. Certificates of competence may be issued by a nationally accredited institution or an internationally acknowledged agency, and periodic recertification is required.

Level 1. &quot; (MED) minimum 28 teaching hours.
* The MED must be competent to perform the assessments of medical fitness to dive of occupational and recreational divers and compressed air workers, except the assessment of medical fitness to resume diving after major decompression incidents.
Level 2D. &quot; (DMP) minimum 80 teaching hours.
* A DMP must be competent to perform the initial and all other assessments of medical fitness to dive of working and recreational divers or compressed air workers, and manage diving accidents and advise diving contractors and others on diving medicine and physiology (with the backup of a diving medical expert or consultant).
* A DMP should have knowledge in relevant aspects of occupational health, but is not required to be a certified specialist in occupational medicine.
* A DMP should have certified skills and basic practical experience in assessment of medical fitness to dive, management of diving accidents, safety planning for professional diving operations, advanced life support, acute trauma care and general wound care.
Level 2H. &quot;Hyperbaric Medicine Physician&quot; (HMP) minimum 120 teaching hours

* manage research programs on diving medicine.
* supervise a team of HBO doctors and personnel, health professionals and others.
* teach relevant aspects of hyperbaric medicine and physiology to all members of staff.

====Gesellschaft für Tauch- und Überdruckmedizin e. V.====
&quot;Society for Diving and Hyperbaric medicine&quot;

German standards for education and assessment of diving medical practitioners are similar to the ECHM-EDTC Standards and are controlled by the Gesellschaft für Tauch- und Überdruckmedizin e. V. They include Medical Examiner of Divers, Diving Medicine Physician, Hyperbaric Medicine Physician, Chief Hyperbaric Medicine Physician and Hyperbaric Medicine Consultant.

====Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Unterwasser- und Hyperbarmedizin====
&quot;Swiss Society for underwater and hyperbaric medicine&quot;.

Swiss standards for education and assessment of diving medical practitioners are controlled by the Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Unterwasser- und Hyperbarmedizin. They include Medical Examiner of Divers, Diving Medicine Physician and Hyperbaric Medicine Physician.

====Österreichische Gesellschaft für Tauch- und Hyperbarmedizin====
&quot;Austrian Society for Diving and Hyperbaric medicine&quot;.

Austrian standards for education and assessment of diving medical practitioners are controlled by the Österreichische Gesellschaft für Tauch- und Hyperbarmedizin They include Medical Examiner of Divers, Diving Medicine Physician, Hyperbaric Medicine Physician, Chief Hyperbaric Medicine Physician and Hyperbaric Medicine Consultant.

=== Registration ===
The American Medical Association recognises the sub-speciality &quot;Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine&quot; held by someone who is already Board Certified in some other speciality.

The South African Department of Employment and Labour registers two levels of &quot;Diving Medical Practitioner&quot;. Level 1 is qualified to conduct annual examinations and certification of medical fitness to dive, on commercial divers (equivalent to ECHM-EDTC Level 1. Medical Examiner of Divers), and Level 2 is qualified to provide medical advice to a diving contractor and hyperbaric treatment for diving injuries (equivalent to ECHM-EDTC Level 2D Diving Medicine Physician)

Australia has a four tier system: In 2007 there was no recognised equivalence with the European standard.
* GPs completing the first tier four- to five-day course on how to examine divers for &#x27;fitness to dive&#x27; can then add their names to the SPUMS Diving Doctors List
* GPs completing the second tier two-week diving medicine courses provided by the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Adelaide Hospital, or the two-week course in Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine provided by the ANZ Hyperbaric Medicine Group, qualify to do commercial-diving medicals.
* The third tier is the SPUMS Diploma in Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine. The candidate must attend a two-week course, write a dissertation related to DHM and have the equivalent of six months&#x27; full-time experience working in a hyperbaric medicine unit.
* The fourth tier is the Certificate in Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine from the ANZ College of Anaesthetists.

== Training of divers and support staff in relevant first aid ==

=== Divers ===
A basic knowledge understanding of the causes, symptoms and first aid treatment of diving related disorders is part of the basic training for most recreational and professional divers, both to help the diver avoid the disorders, and to allow appropriate action in case of an incident resulting in injury.

==== Recreational divers ====
A recreational diver has the same duty of care to other divers as any ordinary member of the public, and therefore there is no obligation to train recreational divers in first aid or other medical skills. Nevertheless, first aid training is recommended by most, if not all, recreational diver training agencies.

Recreational diving instructors and divemasters, on the other hand, are to a greater or lesser extent responsible for the safety of divers under their guidance, and therefore are generally required to be trained and certified to some level of rescue and first aid competence, as defined in the relevant training standards of the certifying body. In many cases this includes certification in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first aid oxygen administration for diving accidents.

==== Professional divers ====
Professional divers usually operate as members of a team with a duty of care for other members of the team. Divers are expected to act as standby divers for other members of the team and the duties of a standby diver include rescue attempts if the working diver gets into difficulties. Consequently, professional divers are generally required to be trained in rescue procedures appropriate to the modes of diving they are certified in, and to administer first aid in emergencies. The specific training, competence and registration for these skills varies, and may be specified by state or national legislation or by industry codes of practice.

Diving supervisors have a similar duty of care, and as they are responsible for operational planning and safety, generally are also expected to manage emergency procedures, including the first aid that may be required. The level of first aid training, competence and certification will generally take this into account.
* In South Africa, registered commercial and scientific divers must hold current certification in first aid at the national Level 1, with additional training in oxygen administration for diving accidents, and registered diving supervisors must hold Level 2 first aid certification.
* Offshore diving contractors frequently follow the IMCA recommendations.

=== Diver medic ===
A diver medic or diving medical technician is a member of a dive team who is trained in advanced first aid.

A diver medic recognised by IMCA must be capable of administering first aid and emergency treatment, and carrying out the directions of a physician, and be familiar with diving procedures and compression chamber operation. The diver medic must also be able to assist the diving supervisor with decompression procedures, and provide treatment in a hyperbaric chamber in an emergency. The diver medic must hold, at a minimum, a valid certificate of medical fitness to operate in a pressurized environment, and a certificate of medical fitness to dive.

Training standards for diver medic are described in the IMCA Scheme for Recognition of Diver Medic Training.

== Ethical and medicolegal issues ==
Experimental work on human subjects is often ethically and/or legally impracticable. Tests where the endpoint is symptomatic decompression sickness are difficult to authorise and this makes the accumulation of adequate and statistically valid data difficult. The precautionary principle may be applied in the absence of information allowing a realistic assessment of risk. Analysis of investigations into accidents is useful when reliable results are available, which is less often than would be desirable, but privacy concerns prevent a large mount of information potentially useful to the general diving population from being made available to researchers.
==Long-term effects of underwater diving==

Diving and other hyperbaric exposure has a well established connection with several acute conditions such as decompression illness and barotrauma. Recovery depends on the severity of the injury and the treatment, and is often complete. The possible long term health effects of diving are less known, particularly in cases where no clinical symptoms were recorded over the diver&#x27;s career. Dysbaric osteonecrosis has long been associated with hyperbaric exposure requiring staged decompression, and has become a notifiable industrial disease.

Other conditions that affect quality of life associated with long term diving that have not been conclusively connected to the activity include persistent neurological 
abnormalities, reductions to lung function, accelerated hearing loss and accelerated cataract development.

Subclinical effects can occur without immediately noticeable presentations of decompression sickness, as is shown by dysbaric osteronecrosis and hearing deficiencies developing over the longer term in professional divers. Recreational divers may also be at risk for long term development of symptoms affecting the lungs, eyes, ears, and central nervous system. 

Decompression illness has been studied since the condition was recognised, and as the methodology has improved, shortcomings in earlier studies have become apparent. One of the problems of much medical research on diving disorders is the lack of a control group to determine baseline function. Another is that there are few standardised techniques for diagnosis consistently used by the researchers at different centres, making comparisons of dubious validity.

Besides osteonecrosis and hearing losses, there is no substantial consensus about what the long term risks actually are, but the medical literature and anecdotal evidence both suggest that there are potential chronic long-term detrimental effects of diving. However evidence that recreational diving has a measurable effect on life expectancy is inconclusive.

=== Pulmonary function ===

In some cases, long term lung function change has been recorded after a single deep saturation dive.

Thorsen et al 1990 compared observations of saturation divers with matched controls, and found changes consistent with small airways dysfunction which suggested cumulative long term effects of diving exposure on lung function. The change in vital capacity was not considered to have a large effect on the diver&#x27;s health, but shows that divers may develop some air flow obstruction by narrowing of the airways. The general tendency of reduction in pulmonary diffusion capacity with age may be increased in divers. These changes are associated with a decrease in exercise tolerance.

=== Vision ===
Exposure to hyperbaric oxygen may increase the risk of permanent changes to the lens of the eye, such as cataracts. The presence of nuclear cataracts and reversible myopic shift has been attributed to oxidative damage to the lens proteins. Myopic shifts are usually reversible and resolve within days to months, but cataracts are permanent and if sufficiently advanced will require lens replacement surgery. This is hypothesized to be an effect of lifetime accumulated exposure to oxygen.

=== Skeletal system ===
Dysbaric osteonecrosis (DON) has long been recognised as a long term health effect of diving and compressed air work. Survey results for these populations show variable incidence of DON. There seems to be a threshold of inert gas load or decompression stress needed to induce the condition, but the actual values remain obscure.

=== Hearing loss ===
There is evidence that deafness is more prevalent in divers, with loss at most frequencies compared to non-divers of the same age. Some divers are known to have hearing loss caused by acute barotraume, but there is also evidence of general hearing deterioration occurring faster than in non-divers, particularly in professional divers, probably due to high air flow noise levels in helmets and during chamber compression, and from noisy tools. Divers appear to be at greater risk for long term cochlear-vestibular damage and associated high frequency hearing loss.

=== Cardiovascular ===

A survey in 2017 of 768 former divers revealed that high blood pressure was more likely to be reported by divers who did not take a dive-free day after 3 days of strenuous diving. Divers with more than 150 professional dives per year or more than 2000 air dives per year were more likely to experience myocardial infarction or angina than divers with fewer than 50 professional dives per year, and less than 2000 air dives. They reached the conclusion that male former divers are more likely to experience these symptoms than the general population, but did not claim this to be specifically caused by diving, as it could have been a consequence of the associated strenuous physical activity.

=== Central nervous system ===
A 1991 study on saturation divers indicated significantly higher deficits in the central nervous system th the control group in the time span of one to seven years since their last deep dive. The symptoms included difficulties with attentional control (mental concentration) and paraesthesia in the feet and hands, abnormalities associated with lumbar spinal cord and more abnormal electroencephalograms than the control group. These abnormalities were correlated with deep diving, air diving, and saturation diving, and a history of decompression sickness.

However, though neurological effects are routinely observed during deep diving, and transient neurological effects occur in some divers after deep dives, more recent (2011) long term epidemiological studies give conflicting and inconclusive results, and more research is needed to resolve this issue.

Hemelryck et al (2014) conclude that while accident-free scuba diving may have some long term effects on short term memory, there is insufficient evidence to assume that general cognitive functions are affected.

<text>A vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting-laser (VECSEL) is a small semiconductor laser similar to a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL). VECSELs are used primarily as near infrared devices in laser cooling and spectroscopy, but have also been explored for applications such as telecommunications.

==Comparisons with VCSELs==
Unlike a VCSEL, in which two high-reflecting mirrors are incorporated into the laser structure to form the optical cavity, in a VECSEL one of the two mirrors is external to the diode structure. As a result, the cavity includes a free-space region. A typical distance from the diode to the external mirror would be 1 cm. Several workers demonstrated optically pumped VECSELs, and they continue to be developed for many applications including very high power diode laser sources for use in industrial machining (cutting, punching, etc.) because of their unusually high power (see below) and efficiency when pumped by multi-mode diode laser bars. These lasers are in the process of challenging conventional high power lasers such as solid state (e.g., Nd:YAG) and carbon dioxide lasers for machining operations.

However, electrically pumped VECSELs (another matter entirely), were the brainchild of Aram Mooradian, an engineer known for fundamental contributions to diode laser linewidth studies, who worked for many years at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts. Mooradian formed a company, Novalux, Inc., which was the first to demonstrate VECSELs (which they called &quot;NECSELs&quot;). Applications for electrically pumped VECSELs include frequency doubling of near-IR VECSEL emitters to attain compact powerful sources of single-mode blue and green light for projection display purposes.

==Semiconductor gain==
One of the most interesting features of any VECSEL is the thinness of the semiconductor gain region in the direction of propagation, less than 100 nm. In contrast, a conventional in-plane semiconductor laser entails light propagation over distances of from 250 μm upward to 2 mm or longer. The significance of the short propagation distance is that it minimizes the effect of &quot;antiguiding&quot; nonlinearities (the same phenomenon is coincidentally quantified by the linewidth enhancement factor relating to Mooradian&#x27;s above-mentioned earlier work) in the diode laser gain region. The result is a large-cross-section single-mode optical beam which is not attainable from in-plane (a.k.a. &quot;edge-emitting&quot;) diode lasers.

In a VECSEL, the external mirror permits a significantly greater area of the diode to participate in generating light in a single mode, resulting in much higher power than otherwise attainable. Monolithic VCSELs emit powers in the low milliwatt range. By contrast, at the 2004 Optical Society of America &quot;Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics,&quot; held in San Francisco, California, one company (Coherent, Inc.) announced 45 watt continuous wave single-mode emission from an optically pumped VECSEL. Numerous other companies and organizations worldwide have adopted the optically pumped architecture for its simplicity.

<text>A rural municipality (RM) is a type of incorporated municipality in the Canadian province of Manitoba. Under the province&#x27;s &quot;Municipal Act&quot; of 1997, an area must have a minimum population of 1,000 and a density of less than to incorporate as a rural municipality. Manitoba has 98 RMs, which had a cumulative population of 301,438 as of the 2016 Census. This is a decrease from 116 RMs prior to January 1, 2015, when municipalities with less than 1,000 people were directed by the provincial government to amalgamate with adjoining municipalities to comply with the &quot;Municipal Act&quot;.

The most and least populated RMs as of the 2016 census are Hanover and Victoria Beach with populations of 15,733 and 398 respectively. East St. Paul is the most densely populated RM at The largest and smallest RMs in terms of geography are Reynolds and Victoria Beach with land areas of and respectively.

<doc id="1256734" wikidata="Q3142238" url="?curid=1256734" title="Minamoto no Noriyori">
<text>was a Japanese samurai lord of the late Heian period and early Kamakura period, who fought alongside his brothers Minamoto no Yoritomo and Minamoto no Yoshitsune at a number of battles of the Genpei War. He was the sixth son of Minamoto no Yoshitomo.

== Early life ==
As children, he and his brothers Yoritomo and Yoshitsune were spared by Taira no Kiyomori in 1160, following the death of their father, Minamoto no Yoshitomo, after their mother Tokiwa became Kiyomori&#x27;s concubine.

== Genpei War ==
Noriyori seemingly disappears from any record until 1180, when he served his brother Yoritomo in Kamakura. Beginning in 1184, four years into the Genpei War, he was sent out from Kamakura by Yoritomo, and made his way to the Taira strongholds of Shikoku. Noriyori helped defeat the wayward Minamoto no Yoshinaka, his cousin, at the Second Battle of the Uji and the Battle of Awazu, before moving on to play a central role in the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani. The Taira were pushed back, and the war fell into a lull for about six months, during which Noriyori returned to Kyoto.

Noriyori was sent out once more, in September 1184, to secure the provinces of the Chūgoku region, and then to move on into Kyūshū. He played a major role in the Battle of Kojima. However, attempting to push further, he ran into difficulties of a lack of supplies, and the fact that the Seto Inland Sea was controlled by his enemies. He wrote to his brother in Kamakura, and was told that supplies were on the way, but that the Taira were watching, so any shipments had to be done very carefully. Noriyori finally managed to get rice, other supplies, and a handful of war junks from a local magnate in Suo Province. He moved on into Kyūshū as planned, and remained there, playing no role in the decisive Battle of Dan-no-ura.

After the Genpei War was over, Noriyori returned to Kamakura, where he was rewarded by Yoritomo for his services. However, there was now a feud for dominance of the clan between Yoritomo and Yoshitsune. Yoritomo ordered Noriyori to arrest their brother; after unsuccessfully trying to convince Yoritomo to change his mind, Noriyori simply disobeyed outright. 

== Death ==
In May 1193, when Yoritomo held a grand hunt on Mount Fuji, an incident occurred in which two brothers of the Soga clan killed Kudo Suketsune, an enemy of their father. A rumor spread that Yoritomo had been killed. Yoritomo&#x27;s wife, Hōjō Masako, was worried, but Noriyori comforted her, assuring her that even if Yoritomo were killed, he would be there for her and for the clan. These words caused Yoritomo to doubt his brother, who confined Noriyori to Izu Province. 

In 1193, Yoritomo had Noriyori killed on charges of conspiracy.

<text>A rural municipality, often abbreviated RM, is a type of municipal status in the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Prince Edward Island. In other provinces, such as Alberta and Nova Scotia, the term refers to municipal districts that are not explicitly urban, rather than being a distinct type of municipality.

== History ==
Unlike Eastern Canada or the United States, the Prairies have never had counties.

The Municipal Ordinance of 1883 was enacted by the then North-West Territories to incorporate and empower municipalities in areas of four or more townships, establishing the offices of Treasurer, Assessor, Collector, and Auditor; departments for roads, animal control, and police; and a judiciary depending on the size of the municipality. The Ordinance also established the category of &quot;statute labour&quot;, wherein each male inhabitant of working age in a municipality was liable for at least one day of labour for property up to and including $300, and an additional day for each $300 value increment; these days could be paid off either by performing labour on the days or paying $2 per day. The Government continued this with the Statute Labour Ordinance (1897), which established sets of statute labour and fire (SLF) districts or statute labour districts in areas not under any municipality. Prairie fires in the 19th century were devastating affairs; fire districts were precursors to local improvement districts (LIDs).

Saskatchewan and Alberta became provinces in 1905. In Saskatchewan, discontinuance of local improvement districts in favour of smaller rural municipalities began on December 13, 1909. Typically, a rural municipality consists of about nine townships, each six miles by six miles in area. Settled areas of denser populations could form urban municipalities such as villages, towns and cities. In northern Saskatchewan, the large Northern Local Improvement District was replaced by the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District in 1972, and was not subdivided into smaller rural municipalities.

<text>(&quot;The Secret Marriage&quot;) is a dramma giocoso in two acts, music by Domenico Cimarosa, on a libretto by Giovanni Bertati, based on the 1766 play &quot;The Clandestine Marriage&quot; by George Colman the Elder and David Garrick. It was first performed on 7 February 1792 at the Imperial Hofburg Theatre in Vienna in the presence of Emperor Leopold II.

==Performance history==
Cimarosa&#x27;s only work still to be regularly performed, it is arguably one of the greatest 18th century opera buffa apart from those by Mozart. Its premiere was the occasion of the longest encore in operatic history; Leopold II was so delighted that he ordered supper served to the company and the entire opera repeated immediately after without the orchestra, with the composer accompanying on the harpsichord.

The Italian premiere of the opera was given at La Scala in Milan on 17 February 1793 with Maria Gazzotti as Carolina and Vincenzo Del Moro as Paolino. On 23 May, the same year, it arrived at the Teatre de la Santa Creu in Barcelona. England saw the work for the first time on 11 January 1794 at The King&#x27;s Theatre in London and the following 6 August it was performed for the first time in Portugal at the Teatro Nacional de São Carlos in Lisbon with Domenico Caporalini as Carolina and Luigi Bruschi as Paolino. The French premiere was given by the Théâtre-Italien in Paris on 10 May 1801 with Teresa Strinasacchi Avogadro as Carolina and Gustavo Lazzarini as Paolino.

&quot;&quot; was first performed in the United States at the Italian Opera House in New York City on 8 January 1834. The Metropolitan Opera presented the work for the first time on 25 February 1937 with Muriel Dickson as Carolina, George Rasely as Paolino, Natalie Bodanya as Elisetta, Julius Huehn as Robinson, and Ettore Panizza conducting.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==

We are in the household of Geronimo, a wealthy citizen of Bologna; he has two daughters, Elisetta and Carolina, and a sister Fidalma, who runs the household. He also has a young secretary, Paolino, who is secretly married to the younger daughter, Carolina. The time is the early eighteenth century.

===Act 1===

Paolino is working to arrange a marriage contract between Elisetta and his patron, Count Robinson, hoping that as soon as Geronimo&#x27;s older daughter is well married, his marriage to the younger one will be acceptable. Count Robinson has written a letter expressing interest – tempted by Elisetta&#x27;s substantial dowry – and Geronimo is thrilled to think that his daughter will be a Countess (&quot;Udite, tutti udite&quot;). Fidalma confesses to her niece that she is in love, too, but only reveals in an aside to the audience that she has her eye on Paolino (&quot;È vero che in casa&quot;).

When the Count arrives he is disappointed to find that it is not Carolina who has been offered to him (&quot;Senza tante cerimonie&quot;). He tells Paolino that he will be content with a smaller dowry and sends him off to arrange the match. Carolina does not dare tell the count that she is married, so when she admits she has no lover it excites him further; she tries to convince him she has no desire or qualification to be a countess (&quot;Perdonate, signor mio&quot;), but he continues to pursue her. Elisetta accuses them both of betraying her, and the commotion attracts Fidalma who joins Carolina in trying to calm Elisetta (&quot;Lasciatemi, signore&quot;); everyone tries at once to explain his or her feelings to the confused and exasperated Geronimo (&quot;Orsù, saper conviene&quot;).

===Act 2===

Geronimo insists that the Count must honor his contract and marry Elisetta, but the Count refuses. When he offers to accept a smaller dowry with Carolina&#x27;s hand instead, Geronimo is delighted to save face and money – as long as Elisetta agrees.

Paolino is distraught, and throws himself on Fidalma&#x27;s mercy, but is stunned to find that she hopes to marry him; he faints, giving her the idea that she returns his emotion and making Carolina think she has been betrayed, but he promises that they will leave the house at dawn and take refuge in the house of a relative.

The Count tells Elisetta all his bad habits and physical defects, hoping she would reject him, but she stands firm – and he finally confesses that he cannot abide her. Geronimo can not persuade her either. Fidalma suggests sending Carolina to a convent, and Geronimo agrees. Carolina is broken-hearted and tries to confess her predicament to the Count, but they are interrupted by her sister, her aunt and her father who are gleeful at having caught them together, and Geronimo sends Paolino off with a letter to the Mother Superior.

After a brilliant and farcical finale Paolino and Carolina finally confess they have been married for two months; Geronimo and Fidalma are furious, but the Count and Elisetta advise them to forgive the newlyweds, adding that they (the Count and Elisetta) will marry after all.

<text>Hillsborough, frequently spelled Hillsboro, is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 5,939 at the 2020 census. The town is home to Fox State Forest and part of Low State Forest.

The main village of the town, where 2,156 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Hillsborough census-designated place (CDP), and is located along the Contoocook River at the junction of New Hampshire Route 149 with Henniker Street and Main Street. The town also includes the villages of Hillsborough Center, Hillsborough Upper Village, Hillsborough Lower Village, and Emerald Lake Village.

==History==
The town was first granted in 1735 by Jonathan Belcher, colonial governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, as &quot;Number Seven&quot;, one in a line of nine Massachusetts towns set up as defense barriers against Indian attacks. The towns were renamed after the border between the two provinces was fixed in 1739, placing the towns in New Hampshire. Settled in 1741, the town was granted in 1748 by Governor Benning Wentworth as &quot;Hillsborough&quot;, named for Sir Wills Hill, Earl of Hillsborough. It would be incorporated in 1772 by Governor John Wentworth.

Hillsborough was the birthplace of Franklin Pierce, the 14th president of the United States and the only president from New Hampshire. The Pierce Homestead was built in 1804 (the year of his birth) by his father, Benjamin Pierce, a general in the Revolutionary War, and twice governor of New Hampshire. Restored in 1925, the home was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the house is today a museum owned by the state and operated by the Hillsborough Historical Society.
A cluster of five stone arch bridges built during the 19th century in Hillsborough is designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.

Railroad service was supplied to Hillsborough by the Boston and Maine Railroad from 1878 to 1972. Rail service north to Henniker ceased in 1942, and Hillsborough became the end point on a line that once stretched in an arc from Nashua to Concord, New Hampshire. The rails in Hillsborough were torn up in 1979. Hillsborough was once home to an iconic railroad covered bridge and a curved wooden trestle. The bridge burned due to arson in 1985, and the trestle was dismantled shortly thereafter. The Hillsborough Branch now ends at Bennington; the line from Bennington to Hillsborough is a rail trail.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.24% of the town. The town center, or census-designated place, has a total area of .
The highest point in Hillsborough is Thompson Hill, at above sea level, in the northern part of town. Hillsborough is drained by the Contoocook River and its tributaries, Beards and Sand brooks. Part of Franklin Pierce Lake is in the southwest. The town lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed.

<text>Harry Burrows Acton (2 June 1908 – 16 June 1974) was an English academic in the field of political philosophy, known for books defending the morality of capitalism, and attacking Marxism-Leninism. He in particular produced arguments on the incoherence of Marxism, which he described as a &#x27;farrago&#x27; (in philosophical terms). His book &quot;The Illusion of the Epoch&quot;, in which this appears, is a standard point of reference. Other interests were the Marquis de Condorcet, Hegel, John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer, F. H. Bradley, Bernard Bosanquet and Sidney Webb. Acton also endorsed a version of negative utilitarianism, according to which the reduction of suffering has unique moral importance.

He had teaching positions at the London School of Economics, Bedford College, the University of Edinburgh where he occupied the Chair of Moral Philosophy, and the University of Chicago. He was editor of &quot;Philosophy&quot;, the journal of the Royal Institute of Philosophy, of which he was for a time Director. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1952 to 1953.

He is buried in Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh close to the main entrance.

<doc id="1256744" wikidata="Q3298147" url="?curid=1256744" title="Group transfer reaction">
<text>In organic chemistry, a group transfer reaction is a class of the pericyclic reaction where one or more groups of atoms is transferred from one molecule to another. Group transfer reactions can sometimes be difficult to identify when separate reactant molecules combine into a single product molecule (like in the ene reaction). Unlike other pericyclic reaction classes, group transfer reactions do not have a specific conversion of pi bonds into sigma bonds or vice versa, and tend to be less frequently encountered. Like all pericyclic reactions, group transfer reactions must obey the Woodward–Hoffmann rules. Group transfer reactions can be divided into two distinct subcategories: the ene reaction and the diimide reduction. Group transfer reactions have diverse applications in various fields, including protein adenylation, biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic approaches for chemical synthesis, and strengthening skim natural rubber latex.

== Mechanism ==
A defining feature of the group transfer reaction is that it is a concerted reaction, in which a bond is broken and formed in one step. The concerted reaction occurs due to the orbital overlap between the alkene and the allylic enophile. The electrons in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the ene are transferred to the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the enophile.
== Sub-categories of Group Transfer Reactions ==

=== Ene Reaction ===
The ene reaction is one of the most common forms of group transfer reactions, where an allylic hydrogen is transferred to an alkene in a cyclic concerted mechanism. The ene reaction is further divided into subgroups including intramolecular ene, metallo-ene, and carbonyl ene reactions. The reverse reaction, commonly called the retro-ene reaction, can occur under high temperatures.
=== Reductions with Diimide ===
Reductions with diimide is another class of group transfer reactions, in which alkenes and alkynes are reduced concertedly with diimide as the reducing agent. In the generic mechanism of a reduction with diimide &quot;(Figure 3)&quot;, nitrogen gas is lost as a result. The diimide reduction displays a higher selectivity for the symmetrical homonuclear C=C double bond compared to the heteronuclear C=O double bond. Along with a preference for reducing the least conjugated double bond, showcasing the precision of reductions with diimides in targeted organic synthesis.
== Applications of Group Transfer Reactions ==

=== Protein Adenylylation ===
Group transfer reactions are prevalent in many biological mechanisms. One example is protein adenylylation, where adenosine triphosphate (ATP) transfers an adenosine monophosphate group to another protein at threonine or tyrosine residues. Adenylylation protein modification adds a negative charge to the protein and thus changes its protein function. Protein adenylylation is especially documented in bacterial modification of GTPases, since this modification of GTPases via adenylylation prevents the host cell’s ability to prevent infection.
=== Biocatalytic and Chemoenzymatic Approaches for Chemical Synthesis ===
The application of the ene reduction can be observed in both biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic approaches for chemical synthesis. The capacity of ene reduction to catalyze diverse reactions with high selectivity renders it a valuable tool in the synthesis of complex and stereospecific compounds. Ene reduction plays a role in the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceutical compounds, agrochemicals, and biofuels. Highlighting the functionality of ene reductases emphasizes their crucial role in catalyzing a variety of reactions. One example is the ene-reductase Old-Yellow-Enzyme (OYE) which can reduce a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) with a catalytic amount of NADH.

<text>Kunitake Andō (安藤 国威, &quot;Andō Kunitake&quot;; born January 1, 1942) Chairman of BJIT Limited, became president of Sony Corporation in June 2000, having been an employee of the company since 1969. On March 7, 2005 it was announced that he would step down to become an adviser, with Ryōji Chūbachi succeeding him as president. 
Andō is from Aichi Prefecture and graduated from University of Tokyo. 

He first served on the board from 1994 to 1997, when he was removed as part of the massive reduction in the size of the board initiated by Sony president Nobuyuki Idei. He did not return to the board until he succeeded Idei as president, even though he was named Executive Deputy President and Chief Operating Officer in April, 2000.
His secondary title was altered to Group Chief Operating Officer in 2003 and to Global Hub President in 2004.

He currently serves as Chairman of The University of Nagano in Nagano, Japan.

<text>In mathematics and computer science, Zeno machines (abbreviated ZM, and also called accelerated Turing machine, ATM) are a hypothetical computational model related to Turing machines that are capable of carrying out computations involving a countably infinite number of algorithmic steps. These machines are ruled out in most models of computation.

The idea of Zeno machines was first discussed by Hermann Weyl in 1927; the name refers to Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes, attributed to the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea. Zeno machines play a crucial role in some theories. The theory of the Omega Point devised by physicist Frank J. Tipler, for instance, can only be valid if Zeno machines are possible.

== Definition ==

A Zeno machine is a Turing machine that can take an infinite number of steps, and then continue take more steps. This can be thought of as a supertask where formula_1 units of time are taken to perform the formula_2-th step; thus, the first step takes 0.5 units of time, the second takes 0.25, the third 0.125 and so on, so that after one unit of time, a countably infinite number of steps will have been performed.

== Infinite time Turing machines ==
A more formal model of the Zeno machine is the infinite time Turing machine. Defined first in unpublished work by Jeffrey Kidder and expanded upon by Joel Hamkins and Andy Lewis, in &quot;Infinite Time Turing Machines&quot;, the infinite time Turing machine is an extension of the classical Turing machine model, to include transfinite time; that is time beyond all finite time. A classical Turing machine has a status at step formula_3 (in the start state, with an empty tape, read head at cell 0) and a procedure for getting from one status to the successive status. In this way the status of a Turing machine is defined for all steps corresponding to a natural number. An maintains these properties, but also defines the status of the machine at limit ordinals, that is ordinals that are neither formula_3 nor the successor of any ordinal. The status of a Turing machine consists of 3 parts:

# The state
# The location of the read-write head
# The contents of the tape

Just as a classical Turing machine has a labeled start state, which is the state at the start of a program, an has a labeled &quot;limit&quot; state which is the state for the machine at any limit ordinal. This is the case even if the machine has no other way to access this state, for example no node transitions to it. The location of the read-write head is set to zero for at any limit step. Lastly the state of the tape is determined by the limit supremum of previous tape states. For some machine formula_5, a cell formula_6 and, a limit ordinal formula_7 then

formula_8

That is the formula_6th cell at time formula_7 is the limit supremum of that same cell as the machine approaches formula_7. This can be thought of as the limit if it converges or formula_12 otherwise.

== Computability ==

Zeno machines have been proposed as a model of computation more powerful than classical Turing machines, based on their ability to solve the halting problem for classical Turing machines. Cristian Calude and Ludwig Staiger present the following pseudocode algorithm as a solution to the halting problem when run on a Zeno machine.

 begin program
 write 0 on the first position of the output tape;
 begin loop
 simulate 1 successive step of the given Turing machine on the given input;
 if the Turing machine has halted then
 write 1 on the first position of the output tape and break out of loop;
 end loop
 end program

By inspecting the first position of the output tape after formula_12 unit of time has elapsed we can determine whether the given Turing machine halts.
In contrast Oron Shagrir argues that the state of a Zeno machine is only defined on the interval formula_14, and so it is impossible to inspect the tape at time formula_12. Furthermore since classical Turing machines don&#x27;t have any timing information, the addition of timing information whether accelerating or not does not itself add any computational power.

Infinite time Turing machines however, are capable of implementing the given algorithm, halting at time formula_16 with the correct solution, since they do define their state for transfinite steps. All formula_17 sets are decidable by infinite time Turing machines, and formula_18 sets are semidecidable.

Zeno machines cannot solve their own halting problem.

<text>Jerome Anthony Ambro, Jr. (June 27, 1928 – March 4, 1993) was an American military veteran and politician who served three terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives for New York from 1975 to 1981.

==Biography==
Ambro&#x27;s father was New York assemblyman Jerome G. Ambro. Born in Brooklyn, New York, he attended Brooklyn public elementary schools and graduated from Grover Cleveland High School, Queens, New York, in 1946. Ambro earned a B.A. from New York University in 1955. He was married on June 11, 1955, to Helen McCooey, with whom he had three children, Cathleen Ambro DeRolf, David Ambro and Richard Ambro. His second wife was Antoinette Salatto.

==Career==
=== Military service ===
During the Korean War, Ambro served in the United States Army as a member of the Military Police from 1951 to 1953 where he attained the rank of sergeant.

=== Early political career ===
Ambro served the town of Huntington as a budget office and purchasing and personnel director from 1960 to 1967. Later, he served on the Suffolk County, New York Board of Supervisors from 1968 to 1969. From 1968 to 1974 he served four terms as Supervisor for the town of Huntington. He was simultaneously chairman of Huntington&#x27;s Urban Renewal Agency, as well as president of Freeholders and Commonalty of the Town of Huntington.

In 1970, Ambro challenged Basil Paterson for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of New York, but was defeated in the primary election.

=== Congress ===
Elected as a Democrat to the 94th, 95th and 96th United States Congresses, Ambro served from January 3, 1975, to January 3, 1981. He led the Democratic Party to its first sweep of Huntington elections in 35 years. While Ambro was in office, the town of Huntington became the first municipality to ban the use of the pesticide DDT.

During his first term in the House, Ambro was elected president of his 82-member freshman class. Ambro served on the Public Works and Transportation Committee and was elected chairman of the House Science and Technology Committee Subcommittee on Natural Resources and the Environment. Ambro played a major role in winning the preservation of wetlands in Massapequa, New York, and having Brookhaven National Laboratory designated as the site of a high-energy reactor.

In 1980, Ambro authored an amendment to the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (Section 106(f)) to require that the disposal of dredged material into Long Island Sound from any federal project, or from any non-federal project exceeding 25,000 cubic yards (19,000 m³), comply with the environmental criteria for ocean dumping under the MPRSA, in addition to the requirements of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

He was defeated for re-election in 1980 by Gregory W. Carman

After leaving Congress, he worked as a lobbyist and was a governmental and legislative consultant.

==Death and legacy==
Ambro died from diabetes in a hospital at Falls Church, Virginia, on March 4, 1993 (age 64 years, 250 days). He is interred at Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia.

The East Northport, New York, post office building was renamed the Jerome Anthony Ambro, Jr. Post Office Building in 1998. The Town of Huntington named the Jerome Ambro Memorial Wetlands Preserve in honor of Ambro&#x27;s conservation efforts.

<doc id="1256757" wikidata="Q1461516" url="?curid=1256757" title="Scared Straight!">
<text>Scared Straight! is a 1978 American documentary directed by Arnold Shapiro. Narrated by Peter Falk, the subject of the documentary is a group of juvenile delinquents and their three-hour session with actual convicts. Filmed at Rahway State Prison, a group of inmates known as the &quot;lifers&quot; berate, scream at, and terrify the young offenders in an attempt to &quot;scare them straight&quot;, so that those teenagers will avoid prison life.

The documentary aired on television in the late 1970s, uncensored; it marked the first time that the words &quot;fuck&quot; and &quot;shit&quot; were broadcast on many networks. Some broadcasters (an example being CFQC, a CTV Network affiliate in Canada) added locally produced segments in which experts discussed both the content of the documentary and the rationale behind airing it uncensored.

The documentary received several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. It found that most of the participants did not reoffend. However, studies that compared and evaluated the effects of various Scared Straight programs against a control group have concluded that they increase the likelihood of participants later committing crimes.

== Overview ==
Teenagers in this documentary and the 1980 sequel, &quot;Scared Straight! Another Story&quot;, ranged from 15- to 19-year-old repeat offenders of crimes ranging from petty theft, drug addiction, and public intoxication to gambling, counterfeiting, and racketeering. None of the &quot;graduates&quot; of the original documentary have since been convicted of a felony except for Angelo Speziale, who in 2010 was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison for the rape and murder of his neighbor in 1982 (four years after the film was made).

Most were from the tri-state (Connecticut, New Jersey and New York) area and agreed to accept the experiment in lieu of jail time and/or probation/public service. The producers asked for a range of youth that came from poor inner-city neighborhoods to the affluent suburbs of New York City.

The &quot;Lifers&quot; featured in the film were primarily convicted of murder, while others were in for armed robbery, and some committed both.

One of the actions seen in the film, commonly done at the prison, forces the juveniles to take off their shoes, either by themselves, or by the lifers, pulling them off the juveniles&#x27; feet and throwing them into a mixed pile, as a lesson about stealing from somebody.

At film&#x27;s end, the teenagers say that they have decided that they do not want to end up in jail. The film ends with a &quot;roll call&quot; of the teens, revealing that most were &quot;scared straight&quot;, though a few were said to have reoffended.

== Awards ==
The film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1978. It also won Emmy Awards for Outstanding Individual Achievement–Informational Program and Outstanding Informational Program. &quot;Scared Straight!&quot; won the 1978 George Polk Awards for Film Documentary.

== Preservation ==
The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;Scared Straight!&quot; in 2007.

== Follow-ups ==
The original &quot;Scared Straight!&quot; was followed by a dramatized film &quot;Scared Straight! Another Story&quot; (1980), &quot;Scared Straight! 10 Years Later&quot; (1987), and (on MTV and UPN) &quot;Scared Straight! 20 Years Later&quot; (1999).

On January 13, 2011, A&amp;E introduced the new series &quot;Beyond Scared Straight&quot;, executive produced by Arnold Shapiro and Paul Coyne. According to the A&amp;E website profile for the series: &quot;Each one-hour episode focuses on a different inmate-run program in the U.S., and follows four or five at-risk teens before they attend the program, throughout their day inside the prison, immediately afterwards, and then follows up with them one month later to see the lasting impact of the experience on their lives. &quot;Beyond Scared Straight&quot; is about transforming the lives of young people through intervention and second chances.&quot; In addition, each episode ends with updates of the teen participants since the taping of the program, citing both successes and some failures in their post-prison behavior, and unfortunate news of passings or incarcerations that happen if teens end up down this path.

On February 1, 2011, the Juvenile Justice Information Exchange reported that one of the graduates of the original &quot;Scared Straight!&quot; program at Rahway, Angelo Speziale, later became a convicted felon. In 2010, Speziale was convicted of the 1982 rape and murder of Michele Mika, a teenage girl who lived next door to him, and is currently serving a sentence of 25 years to life in Rahway.

In &quot;Scared Straight: 20 Years Later&quot;, Speziale claimed that the &quot;Scared Straight!&quot; experience changed him, although he admitted in the film that he had failed to lead a straight life. &quot;I broke the law three times after I visited Rahway. Twice right after, still at the age of 17 and 18, and then about five years ago, I did fifteen days in the county jail for disorderly conduct.&quot; He was later arrested for shoplifting in 2005 and a DNA sample linked him to the 1982 cold case rape/murder that led to his imprisonment. A New Jersey law enforcement source has confirmed that Speziale is the same person who appeared in both documentaries.

On August 18, 2011, A&amp;E premiered the second season of &quot;Beyond Scared Straight&quot;, once again in the midst of controversy. Joe Vignati, director of Justice Programs at the Governor&#x27;s Office for Children and Families in Georgia, writes at the Juvenile Justice Information Exchange: &quot;After becoming the highest rated program in the history of the Disney-owned A&amp;E network, a new season of this &#x27;reality&#x27; show returns to titillate the curious and misinformed.&quot; Also, in light of the Speziale case, the Campaign for Youth Justice has petitioned A&amp;E to cancel &quot;Beyond Scared Straight&quot; because they claim that the show promotes &quot;the spread of a noxious program&quot; and may be in violation of federal law and standards set forth by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP).

==Reception and legacy==
As a result of the film, many states introduced &quot;scared straight&quot; programs in an attempt to rehabilitate young delinquents.

In April 1978, James Finckenauer, a professor of the Rutgers School of Criminal Justice, began a test of the Scared Straight program, using a control group, something that had not been done previously. His study concluded that children who attended Rahway were more likely to commit crimes than those who did not.

A meta-analysis of the results of a number of Scared Straight and similar programs found that they actively increased crime rates and lead to higher re-offense rates compared to control groups that did not receive the intervention. The cause of the increase in crime is not clear. The UK College of Policing agrees that there is &quot;very strong quality&quot; evidence that Scared Straight programs cause an increase in crime.

In 2011, two Justice Department officials wrote an op-ed piece in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; describing scared straight programs as &quot;ineffective&quot; and &quot;potentially harmful&quot;. The officials, OJJDP Acting Administrator Jeff Slowikowski and Laurie O. Robinson wrote that &quot;when it comes to our children,&quot; policymakers and parents should &quot;follow evidence, not anecdote&quot;.

In 2004, the Washington State Institute for Public Policy estimated that each dollar spent on Scared Straight programs incurred costs of $203.51.

=== Cultural references ===
Television series &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot; had an end of first-season episode called &quot;Scared Stiff&quot; in which teenage boys were taken to a state prison to scare them out of further crimes.

In 1984, the syndicated animated series &quot;The Adventures of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot; used the &quot;Scared Straight!&quot; formula in the episode &quot;Busted&quot;. There, after the main protagonists are arrested for being accessories to grand theft auto—they had accepted a ride from their new friend, Larry, who admits only after initiating a police pursuit that he had just stolen the car—the police sergeant and court agree to drop the charges against the Cosby Kids ... but only after giving them a tour of a maximum-security prison, where the kids are frightened by the inmates and their behavior. In the end, the Cosby Kids vow to stay out of trouble and promptly disassociate with Larry.

The 1992 &quot;Married... with Children&quot; sixth season, episode &quot;Rites of Passage&quot;, has Al Bundy, on Bud&#x27;s 18th birthday, lamenting how the Department of Juvenile Corrections bused some juvenile offenders over to his shoe store, making them spend over three hours watching him work at his dead-end job, to show them how important it is to stay in school-and out of trouble, &quot;until even the most hardened punk was crying like a baby&quot;.

Between 2008 and 2012, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; satirized &quot;Scared Straight!&quot;-type programs in a series of eight sketches.

In the third-season episode of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; entitled &quot;Notapusy,&quot; a former prison inmate mistakes a gay conversion therapy seminar entitled &quot;Startled Straight&quot; for a &quot;Scared Straight!&quot;-type program and lectures the group of men about the horrors of incarceration, especially the prevalence of homosexual prison sex.

&quot;A Date with the Booty Warrior,&quot; a third-season episode of &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, features a group of children participating in a program called &quot;Scared Stiff&quot;. However, the program is subverted when the children and prisoners collaborate to organize a prison strike.

Rap artist GZA utilised samples of Peter Falk&#x27;s narration for the song &quot;Path of Destruction&quot; from the album &quot;Pro Tools&quot;.

Comedian Tom Segura referenced the Scared Straight episode of 1999 that he claims &quot;aired once&quot; in his Netflix comedy special &quot;Mostly Stories&quot;.

In the &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; episode &quot;Scared Straight&quot;, Beavis and Butt-Head are sent to prison for a day as part of a Scared Straight program. They end up befriending some inmates who share their passion for heavy metal music, and decide to sneak back in to stay longer.

In the &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; episode &quot;Steered Straight&quot;, Drake Parker and Josh Nichols are sent to jail as part of a program that&#x27;s similar to Scared Straight. However, on the way to the jail, the police car they were riding in is hijacked by an actual criminal, who mistakes the brothers for a criminal duo.

<doc id="1256759" wikidata="Q1374966" url="?curid=1256759" title="Eurodusnie Collective">
<text>Eurodusnie Collective was an anarchist collective based in Leiden, the Netherlands. It was established in 1997, in opposition to a summit of the European Council at which the Treaty of Amsterdam was signed. A small school was squatted for the purpose of holding a &#x27;counter summit&#x27; as a protest over the official EU summit. From that, a more permanent anarchist project evolved which was of national importance.

Eurodusnie (English: &quot;Euro? No way!&quot; as well as being a pun on Eurodisney) ran a number of projects in Leiden. The collective also convened the second European Peoples&#x27; Global Action (PGA) conference in 2002.

==School==
Eurodusnie squatted a hotel in Noordwijk in 1997 but were quickly evicted. They then occupied a former school in Leiden on the Boerhaavelaan. This became both a place to live for members of the collective and an activity centre with many public events.

==Freespace==
The Eurodusnie collective became involved with the Vrijplaats Koppenhinksteeg (English: Freespace on Koppenhinksteeg street) a complex of buildings first squatted in 1968. The group ran an information centre, a vegan café and a free shop. It published a zine called &#x27;Dusnieuws&#x27; and a magazine entitled &#x27;Geen Paniek&#x27; (Don&#x27;t Panic).

==Animal rights week==
Eurodusnie put on an animal rights week in April 1998. This involved picketing McDonald&#x27;s fast food stores, workshops and a benefit concert at the Vrijplaats. The picket of the McDonald&#x27;s on the Beestenmarkt on Saturday 11 April caused a disturbance. A Swedish demonstrator was arrested and another was bitten by a police dog. The picket then moved to the McDonald&#x27;s on the Donkermansteeg. The activists also targeted the dolphinarium in Harderwijk and a company called Pharming which was cloning cows. When the demonstrations received negative press, Eurodusnie said that they were not actually the organisers, they were hosting a group called the Dutch Animal Rights Coalition.

==Pieing==
Eurodusnie was associated with several actions to pie politicians. Firstly in 1998, Mayor Van der Sluijs of Noordwijk was pied, to say thanks for the eviction of the hotel since Eurodusnie were now very happy with their base in Leiden. The action was claimed by a group called TAART - &quot;Tegen Autoritaire en Antirevolutionaire Types&quot; (English: &#x27;Against Authoritarians and Antirevolutionary Types&#x27; also &#x27;taart&#x27; means &#x27;cake&#x27; in Dutch).

Next, former European Commissioner Frits Bolkestein (in 1998), Minister of Finance Gerrit Zalm (in 1999) and Pim Fortuyn (in 2002) were all pied. The pieing of Zalm happened because it was not possible to reach the initial target, the President of De Nederlandsche Bank Nout Wellink since activists posing as reporters for the fictitious Arnhems Dagblad newspaper were not allowed into a press conference.

When Pim Fortuyn was assassinated, some of his supporters targeted Eurodusnie as they blamed leftwing groups for his murder. A spokesperson for Eurodusnie said about the murder &quot;We were stunned. We are against violence and absolutely reject it.&quot; Eurodusnie denied that they had been involved with the pieing of Fortuyn, saying the action had been made by the Biotic Baking Brigade and asked for police protection, since they were receiving threatening phonecalls. The police declined to intervene and the same night, the windows of the squatted school on the Boerhoevelaan and the windows of the free shop on the Koppenhinksteeg were broken. Nobody was arrested.

==Right to the city==
Leiden Council began in 2001 to remove young people, homeless and alcohol drinkers from the city parks, including the Burcht van Leiden. To protest this, Eurodusnie organised a party at the castle on 2 June 2002.

There was music, drumming, drinking and fire-eating. At 23.30, the police asked for the party to stop and at midnight it was violently evicted. This became a scandal at the council, with an independent witness blaming the police for being heavy-handed.

==Subsidy==
The political parties CDA, Lijst Pim Fortuyn and VVD complained in 2005 that Eurodusnie was receiving a subsidy of 40,000 euro from the Referendum Commission to campaign against the European Union. With the money the group planned to organise a festival with music and debates.

<text>In computer networking, a mangled or invalid packet is a packet — especially IP packet — that either lacks order or self-coherence, or contains code aimed to confuse or disrupt computers, firewalls, routers, or any service present on the network.

Their usage is associated with a type of network attack called a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. They aim to destabilize the network and sometimes to reveal its available services – when network operators must restart the disabled ones. Mangled packets can be generated by dedicated software such as nmap. 

, most invalid packets are easily filtered by modern stateful firewalls.

<doc id="1256768" wikidata="Q26469" url="?curid=1256768" title="Ene reaction">
<text>In organic chemistry, the ene reaction (also known as the Alder-ene reaction by its discoverer Kurt Alder in 1943) is a chemical reaction between an alkene with an allylic hydrogen (the ene) and a compound containing a multiple bond (the enophile), in order to form a new σ-bond with migration of the ene double bond and 1,5 hydrogen shift. The product is a substituted alkene with the double bond shifted to the allylic position.

This transformation is a group transfer pericyclic reaction, and therefore, usually requires highly activated substrates and/or high temperatures. Nonetheless, the reaction is compatible with a wide variety of functional groups that can be appended to the ene and enophile moieties. Many useful Lewis acid-catalyzed ene reactions have been also developed, which can afford high yields and selectivities at significantly lower temperatures.

== Ene component ==
Enes are π-bonded molecules that contain at least one hydrogen atom at the allylic, propargylic, or α-position. Possible ene components include olefinic, acetylenic, allenic, aromatic, cyclopropyl, and carbon-hetero bonds. Usually, the allylic hydrogen of allenic components participates in ene reactions, but in the case of allenyl silanes, the allenic hydrogen atom α to the silicon substituent is the one transferred, affording a silylalkyne. Phenol can act as an ene component, for example in the reaction with dihydropyran, but high temperatures are required (150–170 °C); nevertheless, strained enes and fused small ring systems undergo ene reactions at much lower temperatures. Similarly, ene reactions with enols or enolates are classified as Conia-ene and Conia-ene-type reactions. In addition, ene components containing C=O, C=N and C=S bonds have been reported, but such cases are rare.

== Enophile ==
Enophiles are typically electrophilic olefins. They are dienophiles. A range π-bonded molecules with electron-withdrawing substituents also participate. In addition to carbon-carbon multiple bonds (olefins, acetylenes), enophiles may contain carbon-hetero multiple bonds (C=O in the case of carbonyl-ene reactions, C=N, C=S, C≡P), hetero-hetero multiple bonds (N=N, O=O, Si=Si, N=O, S=O), cumulene systems (N=S=O, N=S=N, N=Se=N, C=C=O, C=C=S, SO2) and charged π systems (C=N+, C=S+, C≡O+, C≡N+).

== Retro-ene reaction ==
The reverse process, a retro-ene reaction are observed when thermodynamically stable molecules like carbon dioxide or dinitrogen are extruded. For instance, kinetic data and computational studies indicate that thermolysis of but-3-enoic acid to give propene and carbon dioxide proceeds via a retro-ene mechanism. Similarly, propargylic diazenes decompose readily through a retro-ene mechanism to give allene products and nitrogen gas (see Myers allene synthesis).

==Mechanism==
===Uncatalyzed reaction===

The HOMO of the ene and the LUMO of the enophile comprise the main frontier-orbital interaction in an ene reaction. The HOMO of the ene results from the combination of the pi-bonding orbital in the vinyl moiety and the allylic C-H bond. Concerted, all-carbon-ene reactions have, in general, a high activation barrier. A barrier of 138 kJ/mol is calculated in the case of the proplyene + ethylene. However, if the enophile becomes more polar (going from ethane to formaldehyde), its LUMO has a larger amplitude on C, yielding a better C–C overlap and a worse H–O one, determining the reaction to proceed in an asynchronous fashion. This translates into a lowering of the activation barrier until 61,5 kJ/mol (M06-2X/def2-TZVPP), if S replaces O on the enophile. By computationally examining both the activation barriers and the activation strains of several different ene reactions involving propene as the ene component, Fernandez and co-workers have found that the barrier decreases along the enophiles in the order:
:&lt;chem&gt;H2C=CH2 &gt; H2C=NH &gt; H2C=CH(COOCH3) &gt; H2C=O &gt; H2C=PH &gt; H2C=S&lt;/chem&gt;
as the reaction becomes more and more asynchronous and/or the activation strain decreases.

The concerted nature of the ene process has been supported experimentally, and the reaction can be designated as in the Woodward-Hoffmann notation. The early transition state proposed for the thermal ene reaction of propene with formaldehyde has an envelope conformation, with a C–O–H angle of 155°, as calculated at the 3-21G level of theory.
DFT calculations, at the B1B95/6-31G* level of theory support a concerted mechanism. The development of 1,3-transannular interactions in the disfavored transition state provides a good explanation for the selectivity of this process.

===Catalyzed ene reactions===
Computational work on aluminum-catalyzed glyoxylate-ene processes focus on a chair-like conformation at the transition state. The advantage of such a model is the fact that steric parameters such as 1,3-diaxial and 1,2-diequatorial repulsions are easy to visualize, which allows for accurate predictions regarding the diastereoselectivity of many reactions.

==Commercial applications==
Isoprene is produced commercially in two steps from isobutylene, starting with its ene reaction]with formaldehyde. Dehydration of the resulting isopentenol gives isoprene: 
==Regioselection==
Just as in the case of any cycloaddition, the success of an ene reaction is largely determined by the steric accessibility of the ene allylic hydrogen. In general, methyl and methylene H atoms are abstracted much more easily than methine hydrogens. In thermal ene reactions, the order of reactivity for the abstracted H atom is primary&gt; secondary&gt; tertiary, irrespective of the thermodynamic stability of the internal olefin product. In Lewis-acid promoted reactions, the pair enophile/Lewis acid employed determines largely the relative ease of abstraction of methyl vs. methylene hydrogens.

The orientation of ene addition can be predicted from the relative stabilization of the developing partial charges in an unsymmetrical transition state with early formation of the σ bond. The major regioisomer will come from the transition state in which transient charges are best stabilized by the orientation of the ene and enophile.

==Internal asymmetric induction==
In terms of the diastereoselection with respect to the newly created chiral centers, an endo preference has been qualitatively observed, but steric effects can easily modify this preference (Figure 6).


==Intramolecular ene reactions==
Intramolecular ene reactions benefit from less negative entropies of activation than their intermolecular counterparts, so are usually more facile, occurring even in the case of simple enophiles, such as unactivated alkenes and alkynes. The high regio- and stereoselectivities that can be obtained in these reactions can offer considerable control in the synthesis of intricate ring systems.

Considering the position of attachment of the tether connecting the ene and enophile, Oppolzer has classified both thermal and Lewis acid-catalyzed intramolecular ene reactions as types I, II and III, and Snider has added a type IV reaction (Figure 7). In these reactions, the orbital overlap between the ene and enophile is largely controlled by the geometry of the approach of components.

==Lewis acid – catalyzed ene reactions==

===Advantages and rationale===
Thermal ene reactions have several drawbacks, such as the need for very high temperatures and the possibility of side reactions, like proton-catalyzed olefin polymerization or isomerization reactions. Since enophiles are electron-deficient, it was reasoned that their complexation with Lewis acids should accelerate the ene reaction, as it occurred for the reaction shown in Figure 8.
 
Alkylaluminum halides are well known as proton scavengers, and their use as Lewis acid catalysts in ene reactions has greatly expanded the scope of these reactions and has allowed their study and development under significantly milder conditions.

Since a Lewis acid can directly complex to a carbonyl oxygen, numerous trialkylaluminum catalysts have been developed for enophiles that contain a C=O bond. In particular, it was found that Me2AlCl is a very useful catalyst for the ene reactions of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, as well as of other aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. The reason behind the success of this catalyst is the fact that the ene-adduct- Me2AlCl complex can further react to afford methane and aluminum alkoxide, which can prevent proton-catalyzed rearrangements and solvolysis (Figure 9).

In the case of directed carbonyl-ene reactions, high levels of regio- and stereo-selectivity have been observed upon addition of a Lewis acid, which can be explained through chair-like transition states. Some of these reactions (Figure 10) can run at very low temperatures and still afford very good yields of a single regioisomer.

===Reaction conditions===
As long as the nucleophilicity of the alkyl group does not lead to side reactions, catalytic amounts of Lewis acid are sufficient for many ene reactions with reactive enophiles. Nonetheless, the amount of Lewis acid can widely vary, as it largely depends on the relative basicity of the enophile and the ene adduct. In terms of solvent choice for the reactions, the highest rates are usually achieved using halocarbons as solvents; polar solvents such as ethers are not suitable, as they would complex to the Lewis acid, rendering the catalyst inactive.

===Reactivity of enes===
While steric effects are still important in determining the outcome of a Lewis acid catalyzed ene reaction, electronic effects are also significant, since in such a reaction, there will be a considerable positive charge developed at the central carbon of the ene. As a result, alkenes with at least one disubstituted vinylic carbon are much more reactive than mono or 1,2-disubstituted ones.

===Mechanism===
As seen in Figure 11, Lewis acid-catalyzed ene reactions can proceed either through a concerted mechanism that has a polar transition state, or through a stepwise mechanism with a zwitterionic intermediate. The ene, enophile and choice of catalyst can all influence which pathway is the lower energy process. In general, the more reactive the ene or enophile-Lewis acid complex is, the more likely the reaction is to be stepwise.

==Chiral Lewis acids for the asymmetric catalysis of carbonyl-ene reactions==

===Chiral dialkoxytitanium complexes and the synthesis of laulimalide===
A current direction in the study of Lewis acid-catalyzed ene reactions is the development of asymmetric catalysts for C–C bond formation. Mikami has reported the use of a chiral titanium complex (Figure 12) in asymmetric ene reactions involving prochiral glyoxylat esters. The catalyst is prepared in situ from (i-PrO)2TiX2 and optically pure binaphthol, the alkoxy-ligand exchange being facilitated by the use of molecular sieves. The method affords α-hydroxy esters of high enantiomeric purities, compounds that represent a class of biological and synthetic importance (Figure 12).

Since both (R)- and (S)-BINOL are commercially available in optically pure form, this asymmetric process allows the synthesis of both enantiomers of α-hydroxy esters and their derivatives. However, this method is only applicable to 1,1-disubstituted olefins, due to the modest Lewis acidity of the titanium-BINOL complex.

As shown in Figure 13, Corey and co-workers propose an early transition state for this reaction, with the goal of explaining the high enantioselectivity observed (assuming that the reaction is exothermic as calculated from standard bond energies). Even if the structure of the active catalyst is not known, Corey’s model proposes the following: the aldehyde is activated by complexation with the chiral catalyst (R)-BINOL-TiX2 by the formyl lone electron pair syn to the formyl hydrogen to form a pentacoordinate Ti structure. CH—O hydrogen bonding occurs to the stereoelectronically most favorable oxygen lone pair of the BINOL ligand. In such a structure, the top (re) face of the formyl group is much more accessible to a nucleophile attack, as the bottom (si) face is shielded by the neighboring naphthol moiety, thus affording the observed configuration of the product.
The formal total synthesis of laulimalide (Figure 14) illustrates the robustness of the reaction developed by Mikami. Laulimalide is a marine natural product, a metabolite of various sponges that could find a potential use as an anti-tumor agent, due to its ability to stabilize microtubuli. One of the key steps in the strategy used for the synthesis of the C3-C16 fragment was a chirally catalyzed ene reaction that installed the C15 stereocenter. Treatment of the terminal allyl group of compound 1 with ethyl glyoxylate in the presence of catalytic (S)-BINOL-TiBr2 provided the required alcohol in 74% yield and &gt;95% ds. This method eliminated the need for a protecting group or any other functionality at the end of the molecule. In addition, by carrying out this reaction, Pitts et al. managed to avoid the harsh conditions and low yields associated with installing exo-methylene units late in the synthesis.

===Chiral C2-symmetric Cu(II) complexes and the synthesis of (+)-azaspiracid-1===

Evans and co-workers have devised a new type of enantioselective C2-symmetric Cu(II) catalysts to which substrates can chelate through two carbonyl groups. The catalysts were found to afford high levels of asymmetric induction in several processes, including the ene reaction of ethyl glyoxylate with different unactivated olefins. Figure 15 reveals the three catalysts they found to be the most effective in affording gamma-delta-unsaturated alpha-hydroxy esters in high yields and excellent enantio-selectivities. What is special about compound 2 is that it is bench-stable and can be stored indefinitely, making it convenient to use. The reaction has a wide scope, as shown in Figure 16, owing to the high Lewis acidity of the catalysts, which can activate even weakly nucleophilic olefins, such as 1-hexene and cyclohexene.

In the case of catalysts 1 and 2, it has been proposed that asymmetric induction by the catalysts results from the formation of a square-planar catalyst-glyoxylate complex (Figure 17), in which the Re face of the aldehyde is blocked by the tert-butyl substituents, thus allowing incoming olefins to attack only the Si face. This model does not account however for the induction observed when catalyst 3 was employed. The current view is that the geometry of the metal center becomes tetrahedral, such that the sterically shielded face of the aldehyde moiety is the Re face.

Initially, the value of the method developed by Evans and coworkers was proved by successfully converting the resulting alpha-hydroxy ester into the corresponding methyl ester, free acid, Weinreb amide and alpha-azido ester, without any racemization, as shown in Figure 18. The azide displacement of the alcohol that results from the carbonyl ene reaction provides a facile route towards the synthesis of orthogonally protected amino acids.

The synthetic utility of the chiral C2-symmetric Cu(II) catalysts was truly revealed in the formation of the C17 stereocenter of the CD ring fragment of (+)-azaspiracid-1, a very potent toxin (cytotoxic to mammalian cells) produced in minute quantities by multiple shellfish species including mussels, oysters, scallops, clams, and cockles. As shown in Figure 19, the reaction that establishes the C17 stereocenter is catalyzed by 1 mol % Cu(II) complex 2 (Figure 15), and the authors note that it can be conducted on a 20 g scale and still give very good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Furthermore, the product can be easily converted into the corresponding Weinreb amide, without any loss of selectivity, allowing for the facile introduction of the C14 methyl group. Thus, this novel catalytic enantioselective process developed by Evans and coworkers can be easily integrated into complex synthesis projects, particularly early on in the synthesis, when high yields and enantioselectivites are of utmost importance.
