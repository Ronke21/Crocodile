<text>Sir Charles Walter Michael Court (29 September 1911 – 22 December 2007) was an Australian politician who was the premier of Western Australia from 8 April 1974 to 25 January 1982. A member of the Liberal Party, Court was the member for Nedlands in the Parliament of Western Australia from 1953 to 1982. He held multiple portfolios during this time, including as the minister for industrial development from 1959 to 1971, when he became known for developing Western Australia&#x27;s mining industry.

Born in England, Court&#x27;s family migrated to Perth when Court was a baby. He grew up in a working-class family in Leederville and Shenton Park. Court&#x27;s political beliefs became conservative as a young adult when working as an accountant during the Great Depression. He soon married and moved to Nedlands, where he lived most of his life. During World War II, Court served in the Second Australian Imperial Force in Bougainville Island, which earned him an Order of the British Empire. He joined the Liberal Party in 1946 and was elected to parliament at the 1953 state election.

Court became deputy leader of the Liberal Party in 1957 and a minister after the party won the 1959 state election, serving under Premier David Brand. As the minister for industrial development, Court oversaw the Ord River Scheme, the development of the Kwinana industrial area, and the beginning of extensive iron ore mining in the Pilbara after the federal government lifted an embargo on iron ore exports. As the minister for railways from 1959 to 1967, Court oversaw the gauge standardisation project. Court lost his portfolios when the Liberal Party lost the 1971 state election.

After Brand&#x27;s retirement in 1972, Court became the Liberal Party&#x27;s leader. The following day, he was knighted. Court became premier and treasurer upon the party&#x27;s victory in the 1974 state election. During his eight years as premier, Court continued to promote mining and industry, focusing on the North West Shelf Venture, an oil and gas project off the north-west coast of the state. Court also supported the arts by having the government purchase His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre and initiating the Perth Cultural Centre. Court&#x27;s strong opposition to Aboriginal land rights aroused controversy when Court supported Amax Petroleum&#x27;s drilling at an Aboriginal sacred site on Noonkanbah Station. Other controversies included an amendment to the Police Act to prevent gatherings of more than three people in a public place and the closure of the Fremantle railway line in 1979. Court resigned as premier and from parliament in 1982. He was succeeded as the member for Nedlands by his son, Richard Court, who was premier himself from 1993 to 2001.

==Early life==
Court was born on 29 September 1911 in Crawley, Sussex, England. He was the eldest of two sons of Rose Rebecca Rice and Walter James Court, a plumber. The name Charles came from his mother&#x27;s brother, Walter from his father, and Michael because he was born on Michaelmas Day. The Court family left Crawley on 18 March 1912, bound for Western Australia. As the Port of Southampton was stifled by a coal strike, they travelled via Antwerp in Belgium, boarding the German ship &quot;Cassel&quot;. They arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia, on 1 May 1912. The family planned to return to Crawley within five years, but that never eventuated, first because Walter Court struggled to secure a job in Perth, then due to illness, then due to World War I.

The Court family spent their first eight years in Western Australia living in Leederville, just north of Perth. Walter Court eventually obtained a job digging sewerage and drainage trenches, where he formed a good enough impression that he was referred to a plumber who offered him a job. Walter later got injured, and then in January 1916, enlisted in the army. At the time, Rose was pregnant with their second son. Walter trained at Blackboy Hill Camp and left for France in March 1916. Six weeks later, Sydney Hugo Court was born. Charles shouldered heavy responsibility while his father was away. One time, when Walter&#x27;s pay stopped coming through, Charles was sent down to the Perth Trades Hall to give a note to the union secretary.

Court&#x27;s first three years of school were at the local infants&#x27; school. He then attended Leederville Primary School. Walter arrived home in May 1919. By then a lance corporal, Walter first served with the 177th Tunnelling Company and later with the Australian Electrical and Mechanical Miners and Builders Unit. Walter again found difficulty in securing a job. He found irregular work for plumbers HRance and Son. As the economy improved, the work became more regular. Walter was a strong unionist and supported the Labor Party. He admired Labor premier Philip Collier and took Charles to union rallies. In 1921, the Court family purchased and moved into a house in West Subiaco (now Shenton Park), using a War Service Homes Scheme loan. In West Subiaco, Charles attended Rosalie Primary School, and from 1924 to 1926, he attended Perth Boys School.

Meanwhile, in 1919, Court started learning to play the cornet and he soon joined a succession of local bands. Beginning at age 12, Court played in music competitions. He later joined the RSL band, which consisted of ex-servicemen. It was renamed the RSL memorial band so that Court could join, and he became the band&#x27;s solo cornet. He also joined the Young Australia League band and the Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, the latter of which got Court his first job. When he was 15, the secretary of the Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra asked the patron, Sir William Campion, who was also the governor of Western Australia, to put in a good word, which resulted in Court gaining a job as an office boy for law firm Robinson Cox &amp; Wheatley.

===Career===
While working at the law firm, Court decided he wanted to become a lawyer, but found that he could not afford the five years as an articled clerk. He was instead articled to one of the law firm&#x27;s auditors, JF Burkett and Co, later Burkett and McLaren. Court soon became a junior audit clerk, and then began studying an accountancy correspondence course at a technical school. During the Great Depression, Burkett and McLaren saw many bankruptcies, particularly from farmers and storekeepers. This influenced Court&#x27;s political beliefs, pushing him to the conservative side of politics. Court turned 21 in 1932, so the first election he voted in was the state election in April 1933. The 1933 Western Australian secession referendum was held at the same time as the state election. Court voted in favour of secession. Although he would later become opposed to secession, Court throughout his life strongly opposed centralism.

Court passed his final exams for the Institute of Chartered Accountants in March 1933 and the Chartered Institute of Secretaries the following year. He then became a senior clerk, earning three pounds per week. He felt he was underpaid by a pound though, so after negotiations failed, he quit, believing he could earn as much playing the trumpet and start his own accountancy firm meanwhile. Jack Burkett, the son of one of the founders of Burkett and McLaren, joined Court&#x27;s firm, and so it became Burkett and Court: Public Accountants. They established an office on St Georges Terrace, and borrowed furniture from Court&#x27;s parents&#x27; home, unable to afford furniture themselves. One of Walter Court&#x27;s acquaintances, a furniture businessowner, Harry Hearn, heard of the situation, and loaned them proper furniture interest free, confident that the son of Walter Court would be able to pay his debts. Over time, Burkett and Court became profitable and hired new staff, and after two years, was able to pay back Hearn. It was around this time that Court developed a negative opinion of trade unions, which he believed to be intolerant of his clients such as bank managers and creditors.

Court met his future wife Rita Steffanoni as he was asked by a family friend to play music at her 21st birthday party. They then met at several other events before they became partners. They became engaged in January 1935 and bought a house in Nedlands. Somewhat unusually, the title for the house was in her name rather than Court&#x27;s, as he felt his financial situation was precarious. They married on 3 June 1936 at St Alban&#x27;s Anglican Church in Highgate. Their first son, Victor Charles, was born on 13 February 1938, followed by Barrymore (Barry) Michael on 23 March 1941, Kenneth Walter on 11 December 1943, Richard Fairfax on 27 September 1947, and Geoffrey William on 30 May 1949.

Jack Burkett left the firm in 1937, leading to it becoming CW Court, Chartered Accountant. The business continued to expand and moved to a larger office, although Court himself still partially relied on playing music for his income. Later that year, Court was approached by two other accountants to join them in partnership. He agreed, and so Hendry Rae &amp; Court was formed, operating out of Newspaper House on St Georges Terrace. Court joined the Australian Army in 1940 and returned to accounting in January 1946. Later that year, Rae retired, and Hendry retired several years after that. In 1944, Court was made a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants; from 1946 to 1952, he was the institute&#x27;s state registrar; from 1952 to 1955, he was on the state council; became a life member in 1982; and was voted chartered accountant of the year in 1984. In addition to his work with the firm, Court became a director for several companies. This was reduced when he became a member of parliament in 1953. He continued working at Hendry Rae &amp; Court until he became a minister in 1959, and completely left the firm in 1970. Court was also elected by ratepayers to be the auditor for the Municipality of Claremont and was the chairman of the WA Prices Advisory Committee from 1948 to 1952. He was chosen for that role as he had performed well for the Master Bakers&#x27; Association before the war. The committee had the role of advising the government on the deregulation of price controls following the war.

===In the Australian Army===
Court volunteered to join the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in January 1940, but was rejected due to manpower restrictions as he was an accountant. He then got written consent from Hendry, Rae, and some clients, and enlisted in the Australian Military Force (AMF). He was allowed to join the AMF as its members did not serve outside Australia, but its members were allowed to join the AIF after three months. Not wanting to end up in an army band, Court asked to join an AMF corps without one, which meant he enrolled in the Army Service Corps as a private on 5 September 1940. In his first few months in the army, Court was occasionally released to work at Hendry Rae &amp; Court as part of the manpower restrictions. Court was quickly promoted, having been a lance corporal, corporal, sergeant, and lieutenant &quot;on probation&quot; by 5 November. He was promoted to a permanent lieutenant in July 1941. Court&#x27;s commanding officer, Major Ennis, soon told him to form and lead a band, but not wanting to be involved with a band, Court struck a deal that he would form a really good band before being allowed to leave it to concentrate on being a soldier. Court recruited experienced musicians who were about to join the army and people who he had played with in previous bands.

By January 1942, Court had successfully applied to transfer to the AIF and became a lieutenant in the 1st Armoured Division in Victoria. Court was soon promoted to captain. His commanding officer, Horace Robertson, asked that Court form a band, but Court managed to reach another deal where he would form the best band in the Australian Army before returning to being a soldier. Court went to a staff course at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and the division was transferred to Mingenew, Western Australia. After the division&#x27;s band won a competition against other service bands in Geraldton, Court returned to being a soldier. He was promoted to temporary major in August 1943 when he was made deputy assistant quartermaster-general, and later became a permanent major. He then moved to the Northern Territory in October 1943, with efforts to prepare for a possible Japanese invasion in the wake of the bombing of Darwin. In the Northern Territory, Court was injured twice during training. With no combat on the horizon, it was difficult to keep troops motivated. There were more air raids on Darwin in November 1943.

Court was asked to assess whether the region could cope with large numbers of US and Australian troops if General Douglas MacArthur chose to launch an invasion from Darwin to win back the Philippines. Court determined that it could, and the report was presented to an audience including General Thomas Blamey. Court&#x27;s commanding officer, Arthur Allen, praised the report but Blamey said launching from the Northern Territory would be the worst option as it would be slow and cost many lives and much money. A report about Court&#x27;s service in the Northern Territory said that &quot;throughout his service with Northern Territory Force, Major Court has displayed devotion to duty of the highest order&quot; and that Court &quot;has been outstanding in every respect&quot;. In November 1944, Court was sent to the staff college in Cabarlah, Queensland, for more training.

On 3 April 1945, Court was sent to Bougainville Island in the territory of New Guinea, where Australian troops had taken over from American troops. By then, he was a lieutenant colonel and assistant quartermaster-general with the II Corps. Court got off to a rocky start as his commanding officer, Stanley Savige, initially did not like him. Savige did not trust Horace Robertson, so when Robertson told Savige that Court was &quot;a first-class and outstanding officer&quot;, Savige believed the opposite. Savige told Court that unless he changed his mind in four weeks, Court would be transferred. General Allen wrote to Savige that Court would do well, which helped to peruade Savige to let Court stay. At the end of the four weeks, Savige told Court he could stay. Court&#x27;s role in Bougainville was to manage the supply of ammunition, communication devices and medical supplies to troops in the jungle of Bougainville and nearby islands. Court went on some of the supply drops himself so that he &quot;let the RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) and Army crews know I was interested in their work and conscious of the danger and responsibility that was theirs when undertaking these missions&quot;. Court would also carry messages from Savige to commanders on the battlefront. Court was also tasked with leading a team to sever Japanese communications between the north and south of the island, but that mission was called off when intelligence officers determined the mission could not go ahead.

Court was a member of the Australian Surrender Commission when the Japanese formally surrendered at Bougainville on 8 September 1945. After the other staff officers left, Court became the senior Australian officer in charge. Court chose 70 soldiers and intelligence personnel to disarm the 23,500 Japanese soldiers and sailors. Masatane Kanda and Court were concerned that &quot;fanatics&quot; might try to shoot at the Australians, but no such thing happened. After that was complete, Court left for Torokina, where there were 30,000 Australian soldiers waiting to go home. Due to his service, Court was awarded an Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1945. Court later said the OBE meant more to him than any other honour he had received as it had proved he had succeeded as a soldier. Court arrived back in Perth in December 1945 and was demobilised on 3 January, becoming a reserve officer.

==Early political career==

Court accepted an invitation from Harry Hearn to join the Liberal Party and form the Perth City Branch in 1946. Court helped the party during the 1947 state election campaign by convincing people to stand as candidates for the Liberal Party and helping them campaign. There was also some push for Court to be a candidate himself, but that did not eventuate. His reputation within the party grew throughout the campaign though. The campaign resulted in the defeat of Frank Wise&#x27;s Labor government and the election of Ross McLarty&#x27;s Liberal–CDL government. The Liberal Party was for the first time the senior party in the Coalition and it soon changed its name to the Liberal and Country League (LCL) to encourage CDL members to defect to the Liberals. The LCL–CDL Coalition won the following state election in 1950. In the electoral district of Nedlands, Court&#x27;s future seat, long time Liberal MLA Norbert Keenan was not re-endorsed, so he ran as an independent candidate. Keenan was not re-elected, but his preferences resulted in the election of another independent, David Grayden.

Grayden soon introduced a private member&#x27;s bill called &quot;The Protection of Trade Act 1951&quot;, which was supported by Labor and the CDL but not the Liberals, and worried businessmen. The Liberals decided they needed a candidate in Nedlands with a business background. The Liberal candidate in 1950, Cyril Bird, declined to stand again in the 1953 state election, and another potential candidate, Cyril Dudley, Keenan&#x27;s campaign director, chose not to as well. Court was asked to stand as a candidate by a deputation of a dozen businessmen, including Lance Brisbane, Harry Hearn, and Fred Johnston, but declined. Three months later, another deputation asked him to stand. Court told them that there were other, more suitable candidates, but they told him he was the most popular in Shenton Park, the most Labor-leaning part of the electorate of Nedlands. Court was reluctant to stand as a candidate, as his business career would be put on hold, but he eventually agreed, promising to leave politics after two terms, or six years, in parliament.

In a preselection meeting in August 1952, the party endorsed three candidates: Grayden, Court, and Peter Aldred. Grayden refused the nomination and Court threatened to step down, but was convinced not to. Court would later say the campaign was a &quot;nightmare&quot;, as people were confused why the Liberal Party endorsed two candidates. Premier McLarty tried to convince Court to transfer to the electoral district of Leederville, where he grew up. McLarty was in talks with Grayden to convince him to drop the protectionist bill if the Liberal Party were to support Grayden, which was undermining Court&#x27;s campaign. During the campaign, Court received support from Stanley Savige. Grayden&#x27;s election materials said that he would make service to his electorate &quot;his full-time duty&quot;, implying that Court would remain involved with his business. Court ended up winning by 837 out of 8777 votes on a two-party-preferred basis. He was the only new Liberal member elected, and the Liberal Party ended up losing the overall election to the Labor Party. Bert Hawke was soon sworn in as Premier and Court found himself in the opposition.

Aubrey Coverley, the Labor member for Kimberley, died in March 1953, necessitating a by-election for the seat of Kimberley. Court was the only opposition member who campaigned in the by-election as the seat was previously uncontested by any other party and it was believed to be a safe seat for Labor. John Rhatigan of the Labor Party ended up winning and Court gained experience in a part of the state he had not been to previously. The north of Western Australia was isolated and undeveloped and Court saw that it needed to be developed. It soon became apparent that Court would one day become a government minister and eventually the deputy leader of the LCL, although Court still believed he would exit parliament after six years. Opposition Leader McLarty and Deputy Opposition Leader David Brand would ask for Court&#x27;s opinions, and soon, he was put on the frontbench. The Labor Party attacked Court for his business background, saying that he had no understanding of working-class people. Court&#x27;s friend, Alf Curlewis, said that &quot;they don&#x27;t realise it but they&#x27;re making you famous. The worst thing that could happen, if they only knew it, was to ignore you.&quot; Some Liberal colleagues felt indignation over the attention Court had.

Having developed a reputation for campaigning for Liberal candidates, Court was asked to campaign for Fred Chaney in the 1955 federal election against Tom Burke, who had held the Division of Perth for 14 years. The campaign was successful; Chaney defeated Burke to win the seat of Perth. In the 1956 state election, the only candidate to oppose Court was Grayden. Court easily won re-election, receiving 73 percent of the vote, but the LCL overall went backwards, losing four seats. McLarty resigned as LCL leader in 1957, suffering from ill health, allowing for Brand to be elected leader and Court to be elected deputy leader in March that year. It was the elevation of Brand to party leader that convinced Court to stay in politics for longer than six years. Court believed McLarty was a poor leader, but with Brand instead, Court could move forward with his push to develop the northern parts of the state.

Interested in developing the northern areas of Western Australia, Court set up and was chair of the North West and Kimberleys Committee, which developed LCL policy to take to the 1959 state election. Court presented the policy to the party&#x27;s State Council for adoption. However, the federal members did not approve of the policy as it was seen as undermining the Menzies federal government and that they believed the state would request hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for the towns, railways, and ports that were needed. They told Court that there would not be any federal funding for the proposed developments in the north. The State Council ended up endorsing the policy, but there was controversy when the minute taker wrote that the policy had not been endorsed. Court disputed the minutes at the next council meeting, and so the policy was adopted.

Court was re-elected unopposed in Nedlands, so he could focus on campaigning in the rest of the state, especially in the north. Overall, the LCL gained six seats from the Labor Party, enough for the LCL, alongside the Country Party, to win a one-seat majority.

==Brand government==
The Brand–Watts ministry was sworn in on 2 April 1959. Court was appointed as the minister for industrial development, minister for railways, and minister for the North-West. The Country Party had asked that one of its members be the minister for railways, but after the election, the party said that it had no one that could fulfil the role. The railway system was run down at the time and there would inevitably be closures of some lines, so Court believed that no Country MP wanted to do this. Brand made Court the minister for railways, saying that the Country Party would want the portfolio &quot;in a few weeks&quot;. That never happened, so Court continued as the minister for railways for eight years.

The Department of Industrial Development had received little attention from the previous minister, Frank Wise. There were only fourteen staff members, only four of them were permanent, and there was no CEO.

From 16 March 1965, Court took over as the minister for transport from James Craig. He also had Ray O&#x27;Connor appointed as an honorary minister assisting the minister for railways and transport. Following the passage of the Constitution Acts Amendment Act 1965 in August that year, the ministry was expanded by two, allowing O&#x27;Connor to take over from Court as the minister for transport. From 16 February 1967, O&#x27;Connor also took over as the minister for railways.

David Brand lost the 1971 state election, and so Court was removed from the ministry.

===Railways===
In 1957, the Hawke government established a royal commission into the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR). Court was highly critical of the royal commission, and had it finished soon after he became the minister for railways. In July 1959, Court appointed former Tasmanian Government Railways general manager Cyril Wayne as the new commissioner of the WAGR. Court and Wayne held regular meetings on Saturday mornings. Court found that the WAGR system was run down and poorly maintained. He had running sheds in country towns replaced or upgraded and old and low-capacity wagons scrapped. He also outsourced work being done at the Midland Railway Workshops and reduced the number of employees at the workshop by about 25 percent. Poorly patronised passenger trains were replaced with buses, and some routes were completely withdrawn. By the 1962 financial year, the WAGR made a profit for the first time since 1946.

In 1960, the state government reached an agreement with BHP that the government would build a standard-gauge railway between Koolyanobbing and Kwinana by the end of 1968 so that BHP could build a blast furnace, steel plant and additional wharfs at Kwinana and an iron ore mine at Koolyanobbing. Wayne wanted the existing narrow-gauge railways upgraded instead, but Court chose to build a whole new standard-gauge railway between Kalgoorlie and Fremantle and Kwinana, which would link to the existing standard-gauge Trans-Australian Railway at Kalgoorlie and provide a rail link to the eastern states via a single gauge for the first time. Court had to negotiate with the federal government for funding the gauge standardisation project, which was too expensive for the state to handle. Court and Brand travelled to Canberra to talk to Menzies government ministers, securing a funding agreement in 1961. The project was officially announced in August 1961. It was to cover a distance of and cost $82million, of which $53.6million was funded by the state. Court negotiated with the Commonwealth government in 1963 for several variations to the agreement, including the route through the Avon Valley, through the Perth metropolitan area, and near Koolyanobbing. The standard-gauge railway was completed in August 1968, a year after Court ceased being the minister for railways.

==In opposition==
David Brand resigned as leader of the Liberal Party in May 1972. Court was elected unopposed as party leader and thus leader of the opposition; Des O&#x27;Neil was elected deputy leader. There was an attempt by some MPs to put up a token candidate so that Court did not take his leadership for granted, but this fell through. The day after the leadership ballot, Court was knighted &quot;in recognition of service to the government of WA&quot;.

Throughout his time as opposition leader, Court attempted to pass a motion of no confidence in the Tonkin government and have the governor install Court as premier instead, or alternatively force an early election. He attempted this in mid-September 1972, following the government&#x27;s decision to provide a guarantee for a private loan for the construction of a new trades hall building. The government survived with the casting vote of the speaker. Following Labor&#x27;s poor result in the 1973 Balcatta by-election, Court attempted to convince the Legislative Council to block a supply bill, saying that Labor had lost its mandate. After the supply bill was delayed by several weeks, the Legislative Council ultimately decided to guarantee supply.

The 1974 state election occurred on 30 March 1974.

==Court government==
The Court–McPharlin ministry was sworn in by Governor Hughie Edwards on 8 April 1974. Court was sworn in as premier, treasurer, and minister coordinating economic and regional development.

In May 1975, the National Country Party left the Coalition due to a policy dispute between McPharlin and Court. The National Country Party re-joined the Coalition later that month after McPharlin was replaced as leader by Dick Old. The ministry was reconstituted as the Court ministry, which resulted in deputy Liberal leader Des O&#x27;Neil gaining the position of Deputy Premier instead of the National Party leader.

From 18 June 1975 to 22 December 1975, Court was also the minister for federal affairs, a new position. He was succeeded by Ian Medcalf.

===Tresillian controversy===
In 1974, under the Tonkin government, the Tresillian, a former maternity hospital in Court&#x27;s seat of Nedlands, was converted to a home for mentally ill children without consultation with the residents or Nedlands council. Protests and objections soon began to occur, with the council saying the area was unsuitable for the centre. Groups in support of the Tresillian centre appeared as well. Court believed that Nedlands was unsuitable for the Tresillian centre, and had the Health Department sell the land to the City of Nedlands in anticipation of moving the centre to Forrestfield, a location that was criticised by parents for being too far away from the city. The Trades and Labour Council blocked the move, and so Court issued an ultimatum that any staff who prevented children moving to the site at Forrestfield would be sacked and the children returned to their homes. Five Liberal MPs and a National Country MP criticised the decision, and Ray Young resigned as cabinet secretary on 20 July 1976. That day, Court changed his mind, allowing patients at Tresillian to stay until December 1977.

===Arts and culture===
The Court government purchased His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre from the private landowner, Norman Rydge. The first attempt to purchase the theatre in 1976 fell through when the government could not agree on a price with Rydge. The minister for cultural affairs, Graham MacKinnon, then announced plans for the government to build its own theatre complex with three individual theatres. After Court&#x27;s insistence, the sale was back on three days later. From 1977 to 1980, the theatre was restored.

As part of celebrations of the 150th anniversary of Western Australia, the new building for the Art Gallery of Western Australia was opened by Charles Court in 1979.

===Police Act===
In an attempt to stop protests and strikes, the rate at which had been increasing since the late 1960s, the Court government amended Section 54B of the Police Act in November 1976 so that a permit from the police commissioner was required for a gathering of more than three people in a public place. The amendment said that &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; were required for refusal but that there was no right to an appeal. Section 54B was amended in September 1979 after a spate of arrests due to it. It was changed so that any assembly was lawful until it was prohibited, and public meetings and places were more clearly defined. The Labor Party criticised the bill, saying the amendments did not go far enough and Labor Leader Ron Davies unsuccessfully sought to delete Section 54B entirely. It was eventually deleted in 1984 after Labor gained power.

===Oil and natural gas===
One of Court&#x27;s focuses was the creation of a major source of energy for Western Australia. He believed that cheap energy was needed to overcome Australia&#x27;s high labour costs so that processing, particularly the refining of steel, would be economical. In 1964, WAPET discovered a small amount of oil at Barrow Island and a small amount of natural gas near Dongara. When the minister for energy, Crawford Nalder, failed in negotiating with WAPET on behalf of the State Electricity Commission, Court took over and came to an agreement with WAPET. Alcoa Australia also reached an agreement with WAPET to supply gas to alumina refineries in Kwinana Beach and Pinjarra, and Midland Brick reached an agreement as well, and so the Parmelia Pipeline between Dongara and Pinjarra via Perth opened in 1971.

In May 1963, Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil (now known as Woodside Energy) was granted an exploration lease covering over of the North West Shelf off the Pilbara coast. Woodside was joined by Shell and Burmah Oil in 1964, and by California Asiatic Oil (now Chevron) and British Petroleum in 1966, forming the joint venture partners of the North West Shelf Venture. Court maintained a close relationship with the joint venture partners. The first well drilled in 1967 was dry, and by the start of 1971, little oil or gas had been discovered. Court pushed for greater exploration though, and by the end of 1971, large gas reserves were discovered at North Rankin, north of the Pilbara coast and under the seabed. By that point, Labor had won the 1971 state election, and the party soon won the 1972 federal election as well. The Whitlam government&#x27;s minister for minerals and energy, Rex Connor, was opposed to foreign investment in resource extraction, and wanted the distribution of natural gas to be nationalised. In light of this, the North West Shelf Venture was mothballed in 1973. However, after the Liberals won the 1974 state election and amid rising gas prices, the project was reopened in 1974.

Court met with Gough Whitlam and Connor several times in an attempt to convince them to hand back control of the offshore reserves to the state, but they did not budge from their position. Connor threatened to withhold from renewing the North West Shelf exploration permits, but state attorney-general Ian Medcalf and minister for industrial development Andrew Mensaros concluded that the state could legally renew the permits anyway. The joint venture participants were not convinced, so Court travelled to London and California to meet with the heads of the companies involved. He managed to convince them to sign the permits, and by the end of the year, the Whitlam government was dismissed and the Liberal Party had won the resulting election. Court managed to get the federal government to agree for most royalties to go to the state in exchange for the state funding and constructing the Dampier to Bunbury Gas Pipeline.

BHP bought out Burmah Oil&#x27;s share in 1976 when Burmah Oil ran into financial difficulties, and in 1979, Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui &amp; Co. joined the project. In November 1979, cabinet approved the terms of an agreement to allow the North West Shelf Venture to go ahead, and in September 1980, Woodside announced the joint venture partners had agreed and that the project would go ahead. The State Energy Commission came to an agreement to receive 20 years of gas under a take-or-pay contract. This contract was controversial, with many people sceptical that the State Energy Commission required that much gas. The first domestic gas was delivered in August 1984. The joint venture partners had trouble coming to an agreement with the Japanese power companies they intended to export liquified natural gas (LNG) to. Court attempted to hurry along an agreement, including travelling to Japan in December 1981, but it was not until May 1985, several years after Court resigned, that the eight Japanese companies signed contracts for the supply of LNG.

===Views on Aboriginal people and the Noonkanbah dispute===
Court believed that Aboriginal Australians should assimilate into the dominant Australian culture, similar to the assimilation of migrants from European countries into Australian culture. He believed that education should be compulsory for Aboriginal children, and he regretted it when the Brand government&#x27;s plans to implement compulsory education did not succeed. Court believed that access to alcohol by Aboriginal people should be restricted by providing vouchers to Aboriginal people to by food, clothing and shelter. He attempted to persuade Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser of this idea, but the idea was rejected as the United Nations would not have approved. In the 1960s, Court believed mining companies should train Aboriginal people to replace the lost jobs in the pastoral industry. This never occurred though, due to what Court said were &quot;stupid bureaucrats&quot; who stopped him.

The Noonkanbah dispute was one of the most controversial aspects of Court&#x27;s premiership and became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; for Aboriginal land rights. Court was strongly opposed to Aboriginal land rights, as he believed the same laws should apply to all Australians, that land rights would in effect create &quot;separate countries&quot;, and that Aboriginal people would be manipulated for political reasons. In 1976, the Commonwealth government&#x27;s Aboriginal Land Fund Commission bought Noonkanbah Station, a property of slightly less than , for the Yungngora Aboriginal community, granting a pastoral lease to the Noonkanbah Pastoral Company. Over the following years, hundreds of resource tenements were pegged, including by American company Amax Petroleum, who was exploring for oil. Concerns for sacred sites at Noonkanbah soon became apparent, with several sites damaged during exploration by Amax. The Aboriginal Legal Service told Amax in April 1979 that the Yungngora community opposed all exploration and mining on Noonkanbah, and in May 1979, the Yungngora community presented a petition to Opposition Leader Ron Davies calling for miners to be kept out.

After Amax stated its intention to begin drilling near Pea Hill, a sacred site, the Aboriginal Legal Service accused Amax of being in breach of the Aboriginal Heritage Act. The Act made it an offence to &quot;knowingly alter or damage an Aboriginal site or object on or under an Aboriginal site&quot;. The Crown Solicitor agreed with the Aboriginal Legal Service, however Court disagreed, saying that &quot;we will have all sorts of &#x27;sacred sites&#x27; coming up every time we want to move in these areas&quot;. He also believed that it was urgent to get onshore drilling started. A meeting at Noonkanbah station between the Mines Department, the Aboriginal Affairs Department, the Western Australian Museum and the newly-formed Kimberley Land Council came to an agreement that the site was sacred and that no drilling should occur until the Museum completed an investigation.

In mid-1979, Peter Bindon, an anthropologist and archaeologist working for the museum conducted an investigation of the Pea Hill site. He concluded that the &quot;whole area within which any drill hole could be located by the company falls under the influence of the special sites shown to me by the Aborigines of the clan descent group for that area.&quot; The phrase &quot;area of influence&quot; was controversial, and Court used this to argue that this line of reasoning could prevent resource exploration anywhere in Western Australia. Court declared that &quot;no responsible government could accept&quot; this. He also questioned the Noonkanbah community&#x27;s ties to the land. The minister for cultural affairs, Peter Jones, instructed the museum&#x27;s trustees to allow drilling on Noonkanbah station anyway. In June 1979, upon arriving at Noonkanbah station, Amax and the Mines Department found that the Yungngora community had locked the gates and there were 40 people blocking access as well. Days later, the Aboriginal Legal Service obtained an interim injunction from the Supreme Court of Western Australia barring drilling from going ahead. Amax successfully fought to have the injunction lifted, but by then, the wet season had arrived an drilling was not possible until 1980.

In July 1980, surveyors for Amax tried to enter Noonkanbah station, but were stopped by residents. The government took control of the road entering the station and of land under its control to allow Amax to enter. After union bans prevented a water drilling rig from being transported to the site, the Mines Department transported its own water drilling rig to the site instead. To transport a petroleum drilling rig from Perth to Noonkanbah, a journey, the government provided a police escort to prevent protests from blocking the drilling rig. The convoy left Perth on 7 August. Eight union officials who were protesting were arrested along the way. North of Port Hedland, approximately 160 Aboriginal people blockaded a bridge. Near Noonkanbah, the Yungngora people had parked vehicles across the road and chained them together. The convoy arrived at the site on 13 August. The media universally condemned the situation.

The exploration ended with no oil being found. Court for the rest of his life maintained that he would not have done anything different regarding the Noonkanbah dispute. Despite Court&#x27;s claim that the Yungngora people did not have genuine ties to the area, the Yungngora people were granted native title over of land, including Noonkanbah station, in April 2007.

===Fremantle line closure===
During his time as the minister for railways in the 1960s, Court was supportive of Perth&#x27;s suburban passenger railways over road transport, despite advice coming in that the suburban railways should be closed to passenger transport. In the 1977 state election, Court promised to upgrade the suburban railways. In January 1979 though, Court announced plans to close the Fremantle railway line, replace it with buses, and build a road in its place. Freight was to be diverted via the Kwinana to Woodbridge railway. The decision to close the Fremantle line was highly controversial. It was claimed the decision was made without consultation with Liberal MPs. Tom Dadour, the Liberal member for Subiaco, was outspoken against the decision. A petition with about 100,000 signatures was presented to parliament urging the government to reconsider. Court defended the decision by saying the buses would be more frequent, more flexible, more comfortable, and cheaper to run.

The Fremantle line closed to passenger traffic on 2 September 1979; freight traffic continued until the southern route was possible for narrow-gauge trains. Unions placed a ban on contractors dismantling the railway. The line was reopened after the 1983 state election on 29 July 1983 by the Burke government. Court said later that &quot;I never regretted what we did, but I realise it brought a lot of pain with it from a political point of view because it&#x27;s so easy to stir up the emotions. Most of the people that signed the petition had probably never been on the train&quot;.

===1980 state election===
Court had hoped that Des O&#x27;Neil would succeed him as premier, however after a period as acting premier, O&#x27;Neil decided against ever becoming premier. Court tried to convince him otherwise, but O&#x27;Neil retired at the February 1980 state election. Court announced the date of that election only a day before the rolls closed, stopping people from being able to enrol via post, which mainly impacted people living in rural areas, and in particular, Aboriginal voters. The election campaign ran for over six weeks. Court promoted the North West Shelf Project, the Wagerup and Worsley alumina projects, and the potential for mining uranium and diamonds. Opponents campaigned on environmental issues and industrial disputes.

The election resulted in the Liberal Party losing one seat to Labor: Ernie Bridge defeated Alan Ridge to win the electoral district of Kimberley. Three seats also changed hands from the National Country Party to the National Party.

The Liberal Party caucus selected Ray O&#x27;Connor as deputy leader, to the disappointment of Court, who thought O&#x27;Connor only won by &quot;lobbying and ingratiating himself to members&quot;. Court believed O&#x27;Connor was not able to handle portfolios with large budgets, but thought he did &quot;reasonably well with railways&quot; and thought that his personality would help him deal with people. The vacancies in the ministry caused by the departures of Alan Ridge, Des O&#x27;Neil and Graham MacKinnon were filled by Gordon Masters, Bill Hassell and Bill Grayden. The ministry was expanded by two with the addition of two honorary ministers: Ian Laurance and Barry MacKinnon. Court&#x27;s one major error when allocating portfolios was taking industrial development from Andrew Mensaros and giving it to National Country MP Peter Jones as Mensaros was retiring soon and Court wanted to ensure someone else understood the portfolio. Mensaros took this as a demotion and some Liberal MPs were concerned with giving such an important portfolio to a National Country member. Jones nonetheless performed well in the portfolio.

===Retirement===
Court wanted to retire from politics before turning 70, but he chose to delay his retirement to try and resolve the issues with commonwealth–state finances. By the end of 1981 though, having recently turned 70 years old, Court had decided to retire in January 1982. His wife had wanted him to retire, and by that point, there was a minority of Liberal MPs who wanted to replace Court as leader as they considered him too old. These MPs knew they would not be able to defeat Court in a leadership spill, so they aimed to cause instability in the party to change public opinion. Court announced his retirement on 18 December 1981. The Liberal Party elected Ray O&#x27;Connor to succeed him and Cyril Rushton as deputy. Court officially resigned as premier and as a member of parliament on 25 January 1982. He was succeeded as the member for Nedlands by his son Richard Court.

The Liberal Party lost the 1983 state election. Court believed he could have won it, and regretted retiring before it. Ian Thompson, a Liberal MP, criticised Court in 1991, saying that he did not allow &quot;people to grow under his leadership&quot; and that he created &quot;a vacuum behind him&quot;. Court said that his failure to develop a successor was his worst political mistake, blaming it on the assumption that Des O&#x27;Neil would succeed him. He said the role of premier was &quot;beyond O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s ability and integrity&quot;.

==After politics==
In April 1982, Court opened an office in the Perpetual Trustees Building on St George&#x27;s Terrace to provide advice to small and large businesses. Court said that he did not charge any fees, and he detested other former politicians who charged high fees for consulting. The &quot;Western Mail&quot; reported that Court&#x27;s advice was in high demand. During O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s time as premier, Court offered advice and tried to influence the government, particularly regarding Aboriginal land rights and unions.

Court had an interest in increasing trade with Taiwan alongside Ken Court, and in July 1984, he became an inaugural co-chairman of the Taiwan Trade Association (now known as the Australia–Taiwan Business Council). Court helped with the licencing of Westpac and ANZ banks in Taiwan.

==Family==
Court&#x27;s wife Rita died on 18 October 1992. He remarried on 22 June 1997 to Judith Mildred Butt, a nurse. The wedding took place at St Stephen&#x27;s Anglican Church in Serpentine.

Richard Court served as premier of Western Australia from February 1993 to February 2001. Victor Court attempted to enter politics by contesting the 1990 senate vacancy caused by the resignation of Fred Chaney, but was beat in Liberal preselection by Ian Campbell. Ken Court attempted to enter politics several times. He sought Liberal preselection for the Division of Curtin for the 1987 federal election, but was defeated by the incumbent MP Allan Rocher. He sought preselection for Curtin again for the 1996 federal election and won, but was defeated in the election by Rocher, who was now an independent. Barry Court was president of the Western Australian Liberal Party from March 2008 to August 2011. He is married to Margaret Court, former world number one tennis player.

==Death==
In April 2007, Court was hospitalised due to a stroke. He moved into a nursing home in Cottesloe and had another stroke later that year. Court died aged 96 on 22 December 2007 in the nursing home. He was survived by his wife Judy, five sons, 16 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren. A private service was held and the state funeral was held on 4 January 2008 at Winthrop Hall at the University of Western Australia. Governor of Western Australia Ken Michael and Governor-General Michael Jeffery spoke at the funeral. Also in attendance were former prime ministers John Howard and Malcolm Fraser.

==Honours==
British honours and Australian honours and awards received by Charles Court:
* 1947: Order of the British Empire, for distinguished service in the South West Pacific
* 1972: Knight Bachelor, in recognition of service to the government of Western Australia
* 1979: Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George
* 1982: Knight of the Order of Australia, in recognition of service to politics and local government
* 2001: Centenary Medal

A statue of Court outside St George&#x27;s House on the corner of St Georges Terrace and Mount Street in the Perth central business district was unveiled by Governor Malcolm McCusker on 29 September 2011, 100 years since Court was born. The location is near Parliament House, Woodside Plaza, and the offices of other mining companies to symbolise Court&#x27;s support of the mining industry. The statue was commissioned by Labor premier Alan Carpenter in 2008 after Court died; It cost $483,000 to build and was designed by artist Tony Jones.

In 2019, Serpentine–Jarrahdale Grammar School, a private school in Mundijong, was renamed to Court Grammar School in honour of the Court family. Charles Court&#x27;s son Ken had been involved in the school since it opened in 2006 and was on the school&#x27;s board at the time.

<doc id="1227680" wikidata="Q912807" url="?curid=1227680" title="Active ingredient">
<text>An active ingredient is any ingredient that provides biologically active or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or any function of the body of humans or animals.

The similar terms active pharmaceutical ingredient (abbreviated as API) and bulk active are also used in medicine. The term active substance may be used to describe the effective chemical used to control bacteria or pests.

Some medication products can contain more than one active ingredient. The traditional word for the active pharmaceutical agent is pharmacon or pharmakon (from , adapted from &quot;pharmacos&quot;) which originally denoted a magical substance or drug.

The terms active constituent or active principle are often chosen when referring to the active substance of interest in a plant (such as salicylic acid in willow bark or arecoline in areca nuts), since the word &quot;ingredient&quot; can be taken to connote a sense of human agency (that is, something that a person combines with other substances), whereas the natural products present in plants were not added by any human agency but rather occurred naturally (&quot;a plant doesn&#x27;t have ingredients&quot;).

In contrast with the active ingredients, the inactive ingredients are usually called excipients in pharmaceutical contexts. The main excipient that serves as a medium for conveying the active ingredient is usually called the . For example, petrolatum and mineral oil are common vehicles. The term &#x27;inactive&#x27; should not, however, be misconstrued as meaning inert.

== Pharmaceuticals ==

The dosage form for a pharmaceutical contains the active pharmaceutical ingredient, which is the drug substance itself, and excipients, which are the ingredients of the tablet, or the liquid in which the active agent is suspended, or other material that is pharmaceutically inert. Drugs are chosen primarily for their active ingredients.

Patients often have difficulty identifying the active ingredients in their medication, as well as being unaware of the notion of an active ingredient. When patients are on multiple medications, active ingredients can interfere with each other, often resulting in severe or life-threatening complications.

Many online services can help identify the active ingredient of most medications, such as the Medicines Database providing information on medications available in Australia.

== Herbal medicine ==

In phytopharmaceutical or herbal medicine, the active ingredient may be either unknown or may require cofactors in order to achieve therapeutic goals. This leads to complications in labelling. One way manufacturers have attempted to indicate strength is to engage in standardization to a marker compound. Standardization has not been achieved yet, however, with different companies using different markers, or different levels of the same markers, or different methods of testing for marker compounds. For example, St John&#x27;s wort is often standardized to the hypericin that is now known not to be the &quot;active ingredient&quot; for antidepressant use. Other companies standardize to hyperforin or both, ignoring some 24 known additional possible active constituents. Many herbalists believe that the active ingredient in a plant is the plant itself.

<text>Virius Lupus ( – after 205) (possibly Lucius Virius Lupus) was a Roman soldier and politician of the late 2nd and early 3rd century.

==Biography==
Virius Lupus was the first member of the &quot;gens Virii&quot; to attain high office in the Roman Empire. His early career is unknown, but prior to 196, he would have been appointed as &quot;consul suffectus&quot;. He is first attested as serving as &quot;Legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot; at Germania Inferior, and supported Septimius Severus during the civil war that followed the murder of Pertinax. In 196 his troops were defeated by Decimus Clodius Albinus as the fight for the throne intensified.

After Severus&#x27; victory in the civil wars, Virius was appointed Governor of Britannia in 197. Severus sent him to Britain immediately to recover the province from the rebellions that had swept it following Clodius Albinus&#x27; removal of most of the garrison to press his claim for the throne the previous year.

In the north he was obliged to buy peace from the Maeatae. Fearful that they would ally with the Caledonian Confederacy and unable to secure troop reinforcements from Severus, Lupus had no choice but to pay the rebels in return for their withdrawal and the return of a few prisoners. Lupus slowly restored the forts in the Pennines to Roman control although Hadrian&#x27;s Wall was not rebuilt until .

His governorship was assisted by the arrival of Sextus Varius Marcellus as provincial procurator and in who can be seen the germ of the later division of Britain into two provinces. He served as governor until 201 or 202.

It is assumed that Virius was the father of Lucius Virius Agricola, consul ordinarius in 230, and of Lucius Virius Lupus Iulianus, consul ordinarius in 232. He may have been related to Quintus Virius Egnatius Sulpicius Priscus, who appears to have been a suffect consul either during the reign of Septimius Severus or Caracalla

<doc id="1227693" wikidata="Q586575" url="?curid=1227693" title="Antoine Lahad">
<text>Antoine Lahad (1927 – 10 September 2015) was a Lebanese military officer and the leader of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) from 1984 until 2000, when the army withdrew from Southern Lebanon and was dissolved.

==Early life==
Born into a Maronite Catholic family in 1927 in the village of Kfar Qatra, Chouf District. He graduated from the Lebanese Military Academy in 1952.

==Military career==
Lahad took control of the SLA in 1984, following the death of Saad Haddad the founder of the SLA. After several meetings with many political leaders in Lebanon from all religions he agreed to take on the problematic south because his career and stature would allow him to hold together an army from all the Lebanese religions. Lahad was a Lebanese Army major general who was close to the Lebanese President, Camille Chamoun, a Maronite.

=== Military career in the SLA ===

While commanding the SLA General Lahad formed three regiments mainly from Druze, Shia and Christians who fought together to take back control of Lebanese territory from all the Palestinian factions who controlled much of southern Lebanon. During his service he never cut contact with the capital and all leaders from all political factions and religions kept visiting him asking him for help on several matters. He re-instated the salaries of the Lebanese army soldiers in the south which had previously been cut off.

==Trouble with Lebanon and Hezbollah ==
Lahad was condemned to death by Hezbollah following Israel&#x27;s occupation of southern Lebanon. Men were required to sign written pledges not to visit with Lahad or his people if they were traveling into southern Lebanon. His headquarters were at Marjayoun, which flew an Israeli flag flanked by two flags of Lebanon.

===Assassination attempt===
In 1988, 21-year-old Souha Bechara tried to assassinate Lahad. She had been raised in the Eastern Orthodox Church and had become a member of the Communist party. She was tasked with assassinating Lahad. Bechara disguised herself as an aerobics instructor to visit with Lahad&#x27;s family. On November 7, 1988, while she was having tea with Lahad&#x27;s wife, he returned home. Bechara shot him twice in the chest. She was detained by his security team. Lahad spent eight weeks in the hospital and suffered health complications leaving his left arm paralyzed. Soha Bechara was arrested and sent to the Khiam Israeli prison. She spent ten years in Khiam prison and suffered six years of solitary confinement in a tiny cell.

==Israeli withdrawal==
When Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000, Lahad was determined to carry on against Hezbollah. He pleaded for support from Israel: 

==SLA collapse==

Lahad never received the support he asked for, and the SLA collapsed following Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from southern Lebanon. At the time, Lahad was in Paris trying to convince the French authorities to send troops to replace his army.

He came to Israel after the remainder of the SLA disintegrated. In Lebanon, Lahad was sentenced to death for treason &quot;in absentia&quot; in case he ever returned. In a meeting with the Israeli Government Coordinator, Uri Lubrani, in May 2000, Lahad expressed deep concern surrounding the appropriate treatment of SLA members who ended up in Israel following the withdrawal. Contrary to contemporary media reports, Lahad stated that Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, had not tricked him. He highlighted the importance of his country&#x27;s cooperation with Israel and cited the United Nations Security Council resolution 425 as a legitimate reason for Barak&#x27;s withdrawal of Israeli armed forces. Lubrani assured Lahad that SLA members would receive appropriate treatment and thanked him and his men for their &quot;long struggle for peace&quot;. Soon afterwards Lahad went to France to meet up with his family.having family members living in France, the French authorities accepted him to live in the country.

Lahad moved to Paris. He released a Hebrew language autobiography in 2004, entitled, &quot;In the Midst of a Storm: An Autobiography&quot;.

In November 2006, Lahad had an interview with Ynet. He asserted his opinion that Syria was behind the assassination of Lebanese Industry Minister Pierre Amine Gemayel, 

In May 2014, a Lebanese court sentenced him to death in absentia for high treason, intelligence with the enemy and accessory to kidnapping, violence and murder.

Lahad died in Paris on 10 September 2015 from a heart attack.

<text>Sundown towns, also known as sunset towns, gray towns, or sundowner towns, are all-white municipalities or neighborhoods in the United States. They were towns that practice a form of racial segregation by excluding non-whites via some combination of discriminatory local laws, intimidation or violence. They were most prevalent before the 1950s. The term came into use because of signs that directed &quot;colored people&quot; to leave town by sundown.

Sundown counties and sundown suburbs were created as well. While sundown laws became &quot;de jure&quot; illegal following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, some commentators hold that certain 21st-century practices perpetuate a modified version of the sundown town. Some of these modern practices include racial profiling by local police and sheriff&#x27;s departments, vandalism of public art, harassment by private citizens, and gentrification. 

Discriminatory policies and actions distinguish sundown towns from towns that have no Black residents for demographic reasons. Historically, towns have been confirmed as sundown towns by newspaper articles, county histories, and Works Progress Administration files; this information has been corroborated by tax or U.S. census records showing an absence of Black people or a sharp drop in the Black population between two censuses.

==History==
The earliest legal restrictions on the nighttime activities and movements of African Americans and other racial minorities date back to the colonial era. The general court and legislative assembly of New Hampshire passed &quot;An Act to Prevent Disorders in the Night&quot; in 1714: 

Notices emphasizing and re-affirming the curfew were published in &quot;The New Hampshire Gazette&quot; in 1764 and 1771. Following the American Revolution, Virginia was the first state to prohibit the entry of all Free Negros. According to historian Kate Masur, American laws restricting where Black people could live drew inspiration from the English Poor Laws, which were implemented in the Kingdom of England during the Tudor period to restrict the movements of England&#x27;s poor. These laws, which were implemented to ensure that municipal authorities were under no legal obligation to care for vagrants, proved to be a source of inspiration for American officials who aimed to prevent Black Americans from settling in their communities.

Following the end of the Reconstruction era, thousands of towns and counties across the United States became sundown localities, as part of the imposition of Jim Crow laws and other segregationist practices. In most cases, the exclusion was official town policy or was promulgated by the community&#x27;s real estate agents via exclusionary covenants governing who could buy or rent property. In others, the policy was enforced through intimidation. This intimidation could occur in several ways, including harassment by law enforcement officers. Though no sundown towns exist today in the sense of publicly or legally excluding non-white residents, some commentators have applied the term to towns practicing other forms of racial exclusion.

In 1844, Oregon, which had banned slavery, banned African Americans from the territory altogether. Those who failed to leave were liable to receive lashings under a law known as the &quot;Peter Burnett Lash Law&quot;, named for Provisional Supreme Judge Peter Burnett. No persons were ever lashed under the law; it was quickly amended to replace lashing with forced labor, and eventually repealed the following year after a change in the makeup of the legislature. However, additional laws aimed at African Americans entering Oregon were ratified in 1849 and 1857, the last of which was not repealed until 1926.

Outside Oregon, other places looked to laws and legislation to restrict Black people from residing within cities, towns and states. In 1853, new black residents were banned from moving to the state of Illinois. Those new residents who remained more than ten days and were unable to pay the fine were to be punished by forced labor. Although this law faced significant resistance, especially in Illinois&#x27; small black community, it was not repealed until the end of the Civil War in 1865. Similar bans on all black migration were passed in Michigan, Ohio and Iowa.

New laws were enacted in the 20th century. One example is Louisville, Kentucky, whose mayor proposed a law in 1911 that would restrict Black people from owning property in certain parts of the city. This city ordinance reached public attention when it was challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Buchanan v. Warley&quot; in 1917. Ultimately, the court decided that the laws passed in Louisville were unconstitutional, thus setting the legal precedent that similar laws could not exist or be passed in the future. However, this outcome did not stop towns from excluding black residents. Some city planners and real estate companies exercised their private authority to uphold racial segregation at the community level. In addition to discriminatory housing rules, violence and harassment were sometimes used by locals to discourage Black people from remaining in their cities after sundown. Whites in the North were threatened by the increased minority populations moving into their neighborhoods, and racial tensions started to build. Interracial violence became more common, sometimes escalating to race riots.

After the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, and especially since the Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibition of racial discrimination in the sale, rental and financing of housing, sundown towns gradually disappeared, with de facto sundown towns existing into the 1980s. However, as sociologist James W. Loewen wrote in his 2005 book, &quot;Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism&quot;, it is impossible to count precisely the number of sundown towns at any given time because most towns have not kept records of the ordinances or signs that marked the town&#x27;s sundown status. He further noted that hundreds of cities across America have been sundown towns at some point in their history.

Additionally, Loewen wrote that sundown status meant more than just African Americans being unable to live in those towns. Any Black people who entered or were found in sundown towns after sunset were subject to harassment, threats and violence, including lynching.

The U.S. Supreme Court case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; declared segregation of schools unconstitutional in 1954. Loewen speculates that the case caused some municipalities in the South to become sundown towns: Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky saw drastic drops in African-American populations living in those states following the decision.

In 2019, sociologist Heather O&#x27;Connell wrote that sundown towns are &quot;(primarily) a thing of the past&quot;. However, historian James W. Loewen notes persisting effects of sundown towns&#x27; violently enforced segregation even after they may have been integrated to a small degree, a phenomenon he called &quot;second-generation sundown towns.&quot;

==Function==
===Ethnic exclusions===
African Americans were not the only minority group not allowed to live in white towns. One example, according to Loewen, is that, in 1870, Chinese people made up one-third of Idaho&#x27;s population. Following a wave of violence and an 1886 anti-Chinese convention in Boise, almost none remained by 1910.

The towns of Minden and Gardnerville in Nevada had an ordinance from 1917 to 1974 that required Native Americans to leave the towns by 6:30 p.m. each day. A whistle, later a siren, was sounded at 6 p.m. daily, alerting Native Americans to leave by sundown. In 2021, the state of Nevada passed a law prohibiting the appropriation of Native American imagery by the mascots of schools, and the sounding of sirens that were once associated with sundown ordinances. Despite this law, Minden continued to play its siren for two more years, claiming that it was a nightly tribute to first responders. An additional state law in 2023 led Minden to end the siren.

Two examples of the road signs documented during the first half of the 20th century include:
* In Colorado: &quot;No Mexicans After Night&quot;
* In Connecticut: &quot;Whites Only Within City Limits After Dark&quot;

In her 2011 article &quot;Preemption, Patchwork Immigration Laws, and the Potential for Brown Sundown Towns&quot; in the &quot;Fordham Law Review,&quot; Maria Marulanda outlines the possibility for non-blacks to be excluded from towns in the United States. She argues that immigration laws and ordinances in certain municipalities could create situations similar to those experienced by African Americans in sundown towns. Hispanic Americans are likely to suffer, despite the purported target being undocumented immigrants, in these cases of racial exclusion.

From 1851 to at least 1876, Antioch, California, had a sundown ordinance that barred Chinese residents from being out in public after dark. In 1876, white residents drove the Chinese out of town and then burned down the Chinatown section of the city.

Chinese Americans were also excluded from most of San Francisco, leading to the establishment of Chinatown.

===Travel guides===
Described by former NAACP President Julian Bond as &quot;one of the survival tools of segregated life&quot;, &quot;The Negro Motorist Green Book&quot; (at times titled &quot;The Negro Traveler&#x27;s Green Book&quot; or &quot;The Negro Motorist Green-Book&quot;, and commonly referred to simply as the &quot;Green Book&quot;) was an annual segregation-era guidebook for African American motorists, published by New York travel agent and former Hackensack, New Jersey, letter carrier Victor H. Green. It was published in the United States from 1936 to 1966, during the Jim Crow era, when discrimination against non-whites was widespread.

Road trips for African Americans were inconvenient and in some cases dangerous because of racial segregation, racial profiling by police, the phenomenon of travelers just &quot;disappearing&quot;, and the existence of numerous sundown towns. According to author Kate Kelly, &quot;there were at least 10,000 &#x27;sundown towns&#x27; in the United States as late as the 1960s; in a &#x27;sundown town&#x27; nonwhites had to leave the city limits by dusk, or they could be picked up by the police or worse. These towns were not limited to the South—they ranged from Levittown, New York, to Glendale, California, and included the majority of municipalities in Illinois.&quot; The Green Book also advised drivers to wear, or have ready, a chauffeur&#x27;s cap and, if stopped, relate that &quot;they were delivering a car for a white person.&quot;

On June 7, 2017, the NAACP issued a warning to prospective African-American travelers to Missouri. This is the first NAACP warning ever covering an entire state. The NAACP conference president suggested that, if prospective African-American travelers must go to Missouri, they travel with bail money in hand.

=== Sundown suburbs ===
Many suburban areas in the United States were incorporated following the establishment of Jim Crow laws. The majority of suburbs were made up of all white residents from the time they were first created. Most sundown suburbs were created between 1906 and 1968. By 1970, at the peak of the Civil Rights era, some sundown suburbs had already begun to desegregate. Harassment and inducements contributed to keeping African Americans out of new suburban areas.

== List of sundown towns ==
== Sundown towns in popular culture ==

* &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1947), is known as &quot;the only feature film [of its era] to treat sundown towns seriously.&quot; It features a town that excludes Jewish people rather than Black people. According to James W. Loewen, &quot;The anti-Nazi ideology opened more sundown suburbs to Jews than to African Americans... &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot;, Elia Kazan&#x27;s 1948 Academy Award-winning movie [exposed] Darien, Connecticut, as an anti-Jewish sundown town.&quot;
* &quot;The Fugitive Kind&quot; (1960), a film directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Marlon Brando and Anna Magnani, mentions sundown towns. A Southern sheriff tells Brando&#x27;s character about a sign in the small town that reads, &quot;Nigger, don&#x27;t let the sun go down on you in this county.&quot; The same sign is shown in Tennessee Williams&#x27;s play &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;, upon which the film is based.
* In her memoir &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; (1969), poet Maya Angelou describes Mississippi as inhospitable to African Americans after dark: &quot;Don&#x27;t let the sun set on you here nigger, Mississippi.&quot;
*Oprah Winfrey visited Forsyth County, Georgia, during a 1987 episode of her television show following the 1987 Forsyth County protests. The protests stemmed from continued racial conflict and reputation as a sundown-town area into the 1960s, following the expulsion of African Americans in the 1920s.
* &quot;Trouble Behind&quot; (1991), a documentary by Robby Henson, examines the history and legacy of racism in Corbin, Kentucky, a small railroad community noteworthy both as the home of Colonel Sanders&#x27; Kentucky Fried Chicken and for &quot;its race riots of 1919, during which over two hundred blacks were loaded onto boxcars and shipped out of town.&quot; The film aired at the 1991 Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.
* &quot;No Niggers, No Jews, No Dogs&quot; (2000), a play by John Henry Redwood.
* &quot;Banished: How Whites Drove Blacks Out of Town in America&quot; (2006), a documentary by Marco Williams that was inspired by Elliot Jaspin&#x27;s book &quot;Buried in the Bitter Waters: The Hidden History of Racial Cleansing in America&quot; (2007).
* &quot;Sundown Town&quot; (2011), a play by Kevin D. Cohea.
* &quot;The Injustice Files: Sundown Towns&quot; (February 24, 2014), an Investigation Discovery documentary by filmmaker Keith Beauchamp, executive produced by Al Roker.
* &quot;Green Book&quot; (2018), the Academy Award winner for Best Picture, is a comedy drama about a tour of the Deep South in the 1960s by African-American classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), who is arrested in a Southern town for being out after sundown.
* In the first episode of the 2020 television series &quot;Lovecraft Country&quot; (2020) (TV series based on the 2016 book written by Matt Ruff). The protagonists embarking on a road trip across 1950s Jim Crow America are pulled over by a police officer who informs them they are in a &quot;sundown county&quot; and threatens that they could be lynched if they do not leave the county before sundown.

<text>John Stanton Shirley-Quirk CBE (28 August 19317 April 2014) was an English bass-baritone. A member of the English Opera Group from 1964 to 1976, he gave premiere performances of several operatic and vocal works by Benjamin Britten, recording these and other works under the composer&#x27;s direction. He also sang and recorded a wide range of works by other composers, ranging from Handel through Tchaikovsky to Henze.

==Biography==
Shirley-Quirk was born in Liverpool and sang in the choir at Holt High School (today the Childwall Sports &amp; Science Academy). He played the violin and was awarded a scholarship. While studying chemistry and physics at Liverpool University, he studied voice with Austen Carnegie. Shirley-Quirk was a lecturer in chemistry at Acton Technical College until 1957 and played a part in events leading to the formation of Brunel University. In that period he resumed his vocal studies with Roy Henderson. According to Imogen Holst, it was during this period while &quot;earning his living as a schoolmaster&quot; that Shirley-Quirk joined the Purcell Singers, performing at the Aldeburgh Festival. He was a Vicar Choral (choir singer or lay-clerk) at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral from 1961 to 1962.

In 1961 Shirley-Quirk was understudy for the role of Gregor Mittenhofer in the British premiere of Henze&#x27;s &quot;Elegy for Young Lovers&quot; at the Glyndebourne Festival, and in the following year made his operatic debut in Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; as the Doctor. In 1963 he took part as a soloist in Bach&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot; in Ipswich, which was attended by Benjamin Britten, who introduced himself. Shirley-Quirk subsequently joined Britten&#x27;s English Opera Group (EOG) in 1964. His first role with the EOG was to create the part of the ferryman in &quot;Curlew River&quot;, followed by the premiere performances of &quot;Canticle IV: Journey of the Magi&quot;. With the EOG, he made his Covent Garden debut in 1973, creating the multiple roles specially written for him in &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, in which he appears as various antagonists to the character of Gustav von Aschenbach. He made his debut at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera in the same roles the following year. It was also in 1974 that he sang at the Last Night of the Proms in Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;.

With Scottish Opera he sang the roles among others of Count Almaviva, Don Giovanni, Don Alfonso, Mittenhofer (1970, Edinburgh Festival), Eugene Onegin and Golaud. He created the role of Gil-Martin in Thomas Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Confessions of a Justified Sinner&quot; (1976).

In Shirley-Quirk&#x27;s wide concert repertory, he was particularly noted as a fine interpreter of Friar Lawrence in Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, and in the solos in Bach&#x27;s Passions, Handel&#x27;s oratorios, Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot; and &quot;The Seasons&quot;, Brahms&#x27;s &quot;German Requiem&quot;, Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; (which he recorded with Britten conducting) and Tippett&#x27;s &quot;The Vision of St Augustine&quot; (recorded under the composer&#x27;s baton in 1971). In 1977 Shirley-Quirk created the role of Lev in Tippett&#x27;s &quot;The Ice Break&quot; at Covent Garden. He also distinguished himself as an intelligent and sympathetic interpreter of lieder, mélodies and English song.

Shirley-Quirk&#x27;s vast discography includes many of Britten&#x27;s works, Mahler&#x27;s Eighth Symphony under Sir Georg Solti on Decca, and Vaughan Williams&#x27; vocal works under Sir David Willcocks and the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge for EMI. He also sang in the premiere recording of Delius&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; in 1968, under Meredith Davies, shortly after a rare live performance (only the work&#x27;s fifth performance in 62 years) at the Albert Hall with the same forces. Among his early recordings for Saga of British songs is the first complete version (including the Epilogue) of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Travel&quot;.

His vocal art was noted for its &quot;authoritative yet richly communicative&quot; quality, while the gift for musical and verbal detail of a natural Lieder singer and the &quot;oiled-teak smoothness&quot; of his voice took listeners &quot;to profound interpretive depths&quot;.

Shirley-Quirk was appointed associate artistic director of the Aldeburgh Festival in 1982. From 1991 he was on the faculty of the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore, MD.

==Personal life==
In 1975, Shirley-Quirk was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

Shirley-Quirk was married to Patricia (&quot;Pat&quot;) Hastie, who died in 1981, then oboist Sara Watkins, who died in 1997. In 2009 he married cellist Teresa Perez. He died of cancer at the age of 82 in Bath on 7 April 2014.

<doc id="1227708" wikidata="Q942811" url="?curid=1227708" title="Peter Cormack">
<text>Peter Barr Cormack (17 July 1946 – 10 October 2024) was a Scottish professional football player and manager. His greatest success was with Liverpool in the early 1970s, for whom he played 178 times, winning two league championships, one FA Cup and two UEFA Cup medals.

Cormack also played for Hibernian, Toronto City, Nottingham Forest, Bristol City and Partick Thistle. He collected nine full caps for the Scotland national football team, and was a member of the Scotland squad at the 1974 FIFA World Cup that went undefeated but did not advance out of the group stage of the tournament.

Cormack managed Partick Thistle, Anorthosis FC, Botswana, Cowdenbeath and Greenock Morton. He held roles of assistant manager and interim manager at St Mirren and was assistant manager at Hibernian.

==Club career==

===Hibernian===
A product of Tynecastle Boys Club the young Peter Cormack was signed by Heart of Midlothian directly from school. He was the first ground staff boy at Tynecastle Park since Hearts all-time great Tommy Walker in the 1930s. However Cormack left following an incident in which a grass cutting machine damaged a perimeter wall. Cormack was quickly signed by cross city rivals Hibernian who he joined in 1962. After impressing in the reserves he scored on his first team debut in November 1962 against Airdrieonians.

His best season at Hibs was 1964-65 during the 12 months they were managed by Jock Stein (Stein had a 62% win rate at Hibs). Hibs challenged for league and cup until Stein left before the end of the season to manage Celtic in March 1965. Cormack scored twice when Hibs won 4–2 against Rangers at Ibrox Park on 10 October 1964 in one of three victories against Rangers. The 4–2 win at Ibrox was three days after Cormack and Hibs had beaten Real Madrid 2–0 in a challenge match at Easter Road. Cormack scored the opener against Real volleying home a cross by Neil Martin. Stein was replaced by Bob Shankly with whom Hibs finished fourth in the league and lost in the Scottish Cup semi final to Dunfermline Athletic. Cormack played regularly with Hibs in Europe but was unable to progress past the quarter final stage. The most significant of Cormack&#x27;s wins in Europe with Hibs was the November 1967 6-4 aggregate success against S.S.C. Napoli featuring Dino Zoff. Napoli won the first leg 4–1 in Italy. Cormack scored the third as Hibs won the second leg 5–0. Napoli were league leaders in Serie A at the time. Hibs had knocked out F.C. Porto in the previous round when Cormack scored a double in the 3–0 home leg win. They were eliminated 2–1 on aggregate in the quarter final by Don Revie&#x27;s Leeds United.

Cormack scored 75 goals in 182 league games for Hibs in this spell. He was sold in 1970 when after a second sending off in a short period of time he was given a three-month suspension by the authorities in Scotland.

During the summer of 1967, the Hibs team played in the United Soccer Association, a North American competition, as &quot;Toronto City&quot;.

===Nottingham Forest===

Aged 23, in March 1970 Cormack was signed by Matt Gillies at Nottingham Forest. Forest started the season well with Cormack being unbeaten and fourth in the league after six games. They were unable to retain this and slid down the table to finish in 16th. In his two seasons at the City Ground, he scored 15 times in 74 league games and 20 in 86 over all competitions. Ex Hibs teammate Neil Martin joined in 1971. However Forest were relegated from the top flight in 1972 from finishing second from bottom of the league.

===Liverpool===
Four days before his 26th birthday in July 1972, Cormack signed for Liverpool, managed by Bill Shankly. Shankly told Cormack he was &#x27;the final piece in the jigsaw&#x27; of that Liverpool team and he became an integral part of the Liverpool midfield as the Anfield club won their first trophies of the 1970s with the League championship and the UEFA Cup.

Cormack made his Reds debut on 2 September 1972 in a league fixture at the Baseball Ground in a 2–1 defeat to Derby County. His first goal came the following week at Anfield in a 4–2 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. In October he headed the only goal of the game with 13 minutes to go for a home win in the Merseyside derby against Everton. Two minutes into the second half of Liverpool&#x27;s penultimate League match against Leeds United in April 1973, Cormack fired Liverpool&#x27;s opener in a 2–0 win, a result that helped Liverpool to finish ahead of Leeds and Arsenal and win the title for the first time since 1966.

In the UEFA Cup, Cormack scored in the second round win against AEK Athens. Liverpool defeated four German teams en route to the trophy and beat Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-final. Cormack played both legs of the 3–2 aggregate win against Borussia Mönchengladbach in the final . His throw-in fed Chris Lawler to provide the high cross for the first goal. In total, Cormack played 52 games and scored 10 goals in his first season at Anfield.

Cormack won silverware in his second season, when Liverpool emphatically beat Newcastle United 3–0 at Wembley in the 1974 FA Cup Final. Cormack played in the final in central midfield with another Scottish-born player, Brian Hall. He played in all eight games in that FA Cup run and in all 42 league matches that season, two of those as a substitute, as Liverpool finished second to Leeds United in the league. Overall he played 57 games that season, scoring 11 times.

Cormack started his third season with the club by scoring a penalty in the penalty shoot-out win against Leeds in the 1974 FA Charity Shield. His next goal was in the 11–0 thumping of Norwegian minnows Strømsgodset in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup at Anfield, still a club record win. Liverpool again finished second in the league that season, this time to Dave Mackay&#x27;s Derby County F.C. Cormack played 36 league games, scoring three goals.

In 1975–76, Cormack&#x27;s fourth season at Anfield, Liverpool completed another League and the UEFA Cup double. Cormack played in both legs in the UEFA Cup first round 3–2 aggregate win against his former club, Hibernian. Cormack was a regular league starter until the end of October. In the next six leagues games he made the team sheet only once, as a substitute against Coventry City. He was then named as substitute against Burnley before a run of four games in the starting line-up, including a crucial 2–0 home win against Queens Park Rangers that put Liverpool in top spot ahead of the London club. The last of those four games was the 1–0 home league win against Manchester City on 27 December 1975. Cormack scored the only goal in what was to be a landmark game for him. A long-standing underlying problem with knee cartilage materialised into an injury after the game, when the cartilage cracked. He lost his place in the team and missed the rest of the season, which included the 4–3 aggregate win against Bruges in the UEFA Cup Final, and never played again in the Liverpool first team. He was an unused substitute in the 1976 FA Charity Shield win against Southampton at the start of the following season.

In his 125 Liverpool league games Cormack scored 21 times. He played 178 first team games in total, scoring 26 goals.

===Bristol City===

Aged 30, in November 1976 Cormack left Liverpool and joined Alan Dicks&#x27;s Bristol City for £50,000. City were in their first season back in the top tier. City were in a three way dogfight to stay up. In City&#x27;s penultimate game they played Liverpool, who already had the title wrapped up. Cormack was an unused substitute as his team won 2–1. Their final game opponents were Coventry City, who were also fighting to stay up. The kick-off had been delayed due to the large crowd, with some reports alleging it was intentionally delayed by Coventry&#x27;s chairman, Jimmy Hill. Cormack joined the fray as a half-time substitute when his team were a goal down. Sunderland lost away to Everton, meaning a draw between to the two teams playing at Highfield Road would keep both those sides up and relegate Sunderland. News of Sunderland&#x27;s defeat was displayed on the Highfield Road scoreboard. The score in the Coventry v Bristol City game was 2–2 at the time. Both teams then tamely played out a mutually beneficial draw.

Although not challenging for major honours, Cormack enjoyed yet another cup win this time in the Anglo-Scottish Cup in 1978. City played Alex Ferguson managed St Mirren in the two-legged final. The first leg was in Paisley with City beating their hosts 2–1 and Cormack scoring the winner. The 1–1 return leg draw gave City a 3–2 aggregate win.

He scored 15 goals in 67 league games in Bristol.

===Hibernian (second spell)===

Aged 33, in February 1980 Cormack returned to Hibernian where he lined up alongside George Best. However this was insufficient to prevent Hibs being relegated from Scotland&#x27;s top flight at the end of that season. In total he played almost 300 games for Hibs over two spells. He scored once in 20 league games in this second Hibs spell. He stayed til December before moving into management elsewhere.

==International career==

Whilst at Hibs, he won his first full cap for Scotland on 25 June 1966 in a prestigious friendly with Brazil at Hampden Park. Brazil were warming up in readiness to play in the 1966 World Cup which was to be held in England. On Cormack&#x27;s debut the Scots held the reigning World Champions to a 1–1 draw. In total he collected nine full caps all when playing for Hibs and his next club, Nottingham Forest. When at Liverpool he was selected for Scotland&#x27;s squad for the 1974 FIFA World Cup. Davie Hay was selected to play in preference to Cormack who didn&#x27;t cross the touchline for any game time as the Scots returned home unbeaten after the group stage with a win and two draws. Cormack also represented the Scottish League XI six times.

==Coaching career==
On 5 December 1980, he was appointed Partick Thistle manager, succeeding Bertie Auld who had gone in the opposite direction to manage Hibs. Thistle finished sixth in the top flight at the end of Cormack&#x27;s first season there. However they were relegated the season after from finishing 9th of the 10 clubs in the division. They missed out on promotion the season after in finishing fourth. They reached the last eight that season of both cup competitions being eliminated by Celtic and Aberdeen. Thistle missed out on promotion again in the 1983/84 season after when they finished third. Cormack was there for three and a half years leaving at the end of the 1983–84 season. In the league he played for Thistle once in season 1983–84.

From 1984-86 he managed Anorthosis Famagusta in Cyprus. In 1986 he managed the Botswana national football team before he returned to Scotland as assistant manager to Alex Miller at St Mirren. However, on 15 November 1986 Miller was appointed manager of Hibs after which Cormack had two games in charge of Saints as interim manager. Cormack then followed Miller to Hibs as his assistant manager once again. The St Mirren team they left behind won that season&#x27;s Scottish Cup.

In December 2000 he was appointed manager of Cowdenbeath in the Scottish fourth tier. Cowdenbeath were promoted at the end of the season. However Cormack was sacked after 10 days during which time his side never played a game.

In July 2001 he took over at Greenock Morton in Scotland&#x27;s third tier. However he left the following March in a season in which the club were relegated when they finished bottom of the division.

==Style of play==
Born in Edinburgh, Cormack was described on his profile on the Liverpool F.C. website as &quot;a skilful player with an eye for goal&quot; and &quot;a classy player who loved to entertain&quot;.

The article as a Hibernian Hall of Fame inductee says of him:

&quot;Once described as a skinny kid built like a greyhound, he was as hard as nails, his fiery fiercely competitive nature earning him several altercations with officialdom. According to a popular Hibs player of the time, Peter could do everything, pass, beat a man, tackle and head the ball. The versatile Cormack could also play anywhere, out wide, midfield, up front and even in goal as he once demonstrated when keeping a clean sheet for most of the match against St Mirren after goalkeeper Willie Wilson had gone off injured.&quot;

He offered a serious attacking threat from headers with an apparent natural ability to hang in the air. He had a prance like style of running, by running on the balls of his feet. Cormack worked hard to improve as a footballer and did extra training sessions three times a week with Peter Marinello and John Murphy at Hibs. With a background in cross country running, he was very fit using his stamina to tire out opponents to allow space for himself.

==Personal life and death==
Cormack went into the karaoke business. Cormack retired from professional football after he left Morton in 2002. Following a number of years on the after-dinner speaking circuit, Cormack spent time playing in celebrity golf events, working in his garden and helping with his six grandchildren.

His son, also named Peter, played football in Scotland for various clubs.

Cormack died from complications of dementia on 10 October 2024, at the age of 78.

<text>Monton &amp; Weaste Cricket Club were a cricket club in the Central Lancashire League who played at Ellesmere Park in Eccles, Greater Manchester, England. They fielded a First and Second team after joining the league in 2005. They were originally recruited so that the league would return to sixteen member clubs, but Stand later announced their resignation for the 2005 season.

The club formed in 1998 when Monton merged with Weaste Cricket Club, following a decline in the latter’s playing resources over previous years. Both clubs were longstanding members of the Manchester and District Cricket Association. Monton had been a member of the Manchester Association since replacing Stockport in 1937. Stockport had left to join the CLL, but resigned in 1998. Monton &amp; Weaste were chosen to replace them in 2004, ahead of five other applicants. In 2020 Monton, by then playing in the Greater Manchester Cricket League, reverted to their original name.

<doc id="1227714" wikidata="Q1292502" url="?curid=1227714" title="Arabic poetry">
<text>Arabic poetry ( &quot;ash-shi‘r al-‘arabīyy&quot;) is one of the earliest forms of Arabic literature. Pre-Islamic Arabic poetry contains the bulk of the oldest poetic material in Arabic, but Old Arabic inscriptions reveal the art of poetry existed in Arabic writing in material as early as the 1st century BCE, with oral poetry likely being much older still.

Arabic poetry is categorized into two main types, rhymed or measured, and prose, with the former greatly preceding the latter. The rhymed poetry falls within fifteen different meters collected and explained by al-Farahidi in &quot;The Science of ‘Arud&quot;. Al-Akhfash, a student of al-Farahidi, later added one more meter to make them sixteen. The meters of the rhythmical poetry are known in Arabic as &quot;seas&quot; (&quot;buḥūr&quot;). The measuring unit of seas is known as &quot;&quot;taf‘īlah&quot;,&quot; and every sea contains a certain number of taf&#x27;ilas which the poet has to observe in every verse (&quot;bayt&quot;) of the poem. The measuring procedure of a poem is very rigorous. Sometimes adding or removing a consonant or a vowel can shift the &quot;bayt&quot; from one meter to another. Also, in rhymed poetry, every &quot;bayt&quot; has to end with the same rhyme (&quot;qāfiyah&quot;) throughout the poem.

Al-Khalīl ibn ʿAḥmad al-Farāhīdī (711–786 CE) was the first Arab scholar to subject the prosody of Arabic poetry to a detailed phonological study. He failed to produce a coherent, integrated theory which satisfies the requirements of generality, adequacy, and simplicity; instead, he merely listed and categorized the primary data, thus producing a meticulously detailed but incredibly complex formulation which very few indeed are able to master and utilize.

Researchers and critics of Arabic poetry usually classify it in two categories: classical and modern poetry. Classical poetry was written before the Arabic renaissance (&quot;An-Nahḍah&quot;). Thus, all poetry that was written in the classical style is called &quot;classical&quot; or &quot;traditional poetry&quot; since it follows the traditional style and structure. It is also known as &quot;vertical poetry&quot; in reference to its vertical parallel structure of its two parts. Modern poetry, on the other hand, deviated from classical poetry in its content, style, structure, rhyme and topics.

==Pre-Islamic poetry==

One of the first major poets in the pre-Islamic era is Imru&#x27; al-Qais, the last king of the kingdom of Kinda. Although most of the poetry of that era was not preserved, what remains is well regarded as among the finest Arabic poetry to date. In addition to the eloquence and artistic value, pre-Islamic poetry constitutes a major source for classical Arabic language both in grammar and vocabulary, and as a reliable historical record of the political and cultural life of the time.

Poetry held an important position in pre-Islamic society with the poet or &quot;sha&#x27;ir&quot; filling the role of historian, soothsayer and propagandist. Words in praise of the tribe (&quot;qit&#x27;ah&quot;) and lampoons denigrating other tribes (&quot;hija&quot;&#x27;) seem to have been some of the most popular forms of early poetry. The &quot;sha&#x27;ir&quot; represented an individual tribe&#x27;s prestige and importance in the Arabian Peninsula, and mock battles in poetry or &quot;zajal&quot; would stand in lieu of real wars. &#x27;Ukaz, a market town not far from Mecca, would play host to a regular poetry festival where the craft of the &quot;sha&#x27;irs&quot; would be exhibited.

Alongside the &quot;sha&#x27;ir&quot;, and often as his poetic apprentice, was the &quot;rawi&quot; or reciter. The job of the rawi was to learn the poems by heart and to recite them with explanations and probably often with embellishments. This tradition allowed the transmission of these poetic works and the practice was later adopted by the &quot;huffaz&quot; for their memorisation of the Qur&#x27;an. At some periods there have been unbroken chains of illustrious poets, each one training a &quot;rawi&quot; as a bard to promote his verse, and then to take over from them and continue the poetic tradition. For example, Tufayl trained &#x27;Awas ibn Hajar, &#x27;Awas trained Zuhayr, Zuhayr trained his son Ka`b, Ka`b trained al-Hutay&#x27;ah, al-Hutay&#x27;ah trained Jamil Buthaynah and Jamil trained Kuthayyir `Azza.

Among the most famous poets of the pre-Islamic era are Imru&#x27; al-Qais, Samaw&#x27;al ibn &#x27;Adiya, al-Nabigha, Tarafa, Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma, and Antarah ibn Shaddad. Other poets, such as Ta&#x27;abbata Sharran, al-Shanfara, Urwa ibn al-Ward, were known as &quot;su&#x27;luk&quot; or vagabond poets, much of whose works consisted of attacks on the rigidity of tribal life and praise of solitude. Some of these attacks on the values of the clan and of the tribe were meant to be ironic, teasing the listeners only in order finally to endorse all that the members of the audience held most dear about their communal values and way of life. While such poets were identified closely with their own tribes, others, such as al-A&#x27;sha, were known for their wanderings in search of work from whoever needed poetry.

Some of the most reputable collections of these poems included the &quot;Mu&#x27;allaqat&quot; (meaning &quot;the hung poems&quot;, because they are traditionally thought to have been hung on or in the Kaaba) and the &quot;Mufaddaliyat&quot; (meaning &quot;al-Mufaddal&#x27;s examination&quot; or &quot;anthology&quot;). The Mu&#x27;allaqat aimed to be the definitive source of the era&#x27;s output with only a single example of the work of each of the so-called &quot;seven renowned ones,&quot; although different versions differ in which &quot;renowned ones&quot; they chose. The &quot;Mufaddaliyat&quot; on the other hand contains a random collection of poetic material.

There are several characteristics that distinguish pre-Islamic poetry from the poetry of later times. One of these characteristics is that in pre-Islamic poetry more attention was given to the eloquence and the wording of the verse than to the poem as whole. This resulted in poems characterized by strong vocabulary and short ideas but with loosely connected verses. A second characteristic is the romantic or nostalgic prelude with which pre-Islamic poems would often start. In these preludes, a thematic unit called &quot;&quot;nasib&quot;,&quot; the poet would remember his beloved and her deserted home and its ruins. This concept in Arabic poetry is referred to as &quot;al-woqouf `ala al-atlal&quot; (الوقوف على الأطلال / standing by the ruins) because the poet would often start his poem by saying that he stood at the ruins of his beloved; it is a kind of &quot;ubi sunt&quot;.

It was the early poems&#x27; importance to Islamic scholarship which led to their preservation. Not only did the poems illuminate life in the early years of Islam and its antecedents but they would also prove the basis for the study of linguistics of which the Qur&#x27;an was regarded as the pinnacle. Many of the pre-Islamic forms of verse were retained and improved upon. &quot;Naqa&#x27;id&quot; or flytings, where two poets exchange creative insults, were popular with al-Farazdaq and Jarir swapping a great deal of invective. The tradition continued in a slightly modified form as &quot;zajal&quot;, in which two groups &#x27;joust&#x27; in verse, and remains a common style in Lebanon.

Arabic Andalusi poetry in al-Andalus, or Islamic Iberia (Islamic Spain), involved figures such as Ibn Abd Rabbih (the author of the &quot;Al-ʿIqd al-Farīd&quot;), Ziryab, Ibn Zaydun, Wallada bint al-Mustakfi, Al-Mu&#x27;tamid ibn Abbad, Hafsa bint al-Hajj al-Rukuniyya, Ibn Tufail, Ibn Arabi, Ibn Quzman, Abu al-Baqa ar-Rundi, and Ibn al-Khatib.

The rise of poetry in Al-Andalus occurred in dialogue with the golden age of Jewish culture in Spain. Most Jewish writers in al-Andalus—while incorporating elements such as rhyme, meter, and themes of classical Arabic poetry—created poetry in Hebrew, but Samuel ibn Naghrillah, Joseph ibn Naghrela, and Ibn Sahl al-Isra&#x27;ili wrote poetry in Arabic.

Arabic poetry declined after the 13th century along with much of the literature due to the rise of Persian and Turkish literature. Andalusi literature flowered for a little longer, but ended with the expulsion of the Arabs in 1492. The corpus suffered large-scale destruction by fire in 1499 when Cardinal Jimenez de Cisneros made a public &quot;auto-da-fé&quot; in Granada, burning 1,025,000 Arabic volumes.

===Court poets===

Ghaylan ibn &#x27;Uqbah (c. 696 – c. 735), nicknamed Dhu ar-Rumma, is usually regarded as the last of the Pre-Islamic poets. His works had continued the themes and style of the pre-Islamic poets particularly eulogising the harsh but simple desert life, traditionally recited round a campfire. Although such themes continued and were returned to by many modern, urban poets, this poetic life was giving way to court poets. The more settled, comfortable and luxurious life in Umayyad courts led to a greater emphasis on the &quot;ghazal&quot; or love poem. Chief amongst this new breed of poet was Abu Nuwas. Not only did Abu Nuwas spoof the traditional poetic form of the qasida and write many poems in praise of wine, his main occupation was the writing of ever more ribald &quot;ghazal&quot; many of them openly homosexual.

While Nuwas produced risqué but beautiful poems, many of which pushed to the limit what was acceptable under Islam, others produced more religiously themed poetry. It is said that Nuwas struck a bargain with his contemporary Abu al-Alahijah: Abu Nuwas would concentrate on wine and love poems whilst al-Alahijah would write homilies. These homilies expressed views on religion, sin and the afterlife, but occasionally strayed into unorthodox territory. While the work of al-Alahijah was acceptable, others such as the poet Salih ibn &#x27;Abd al-Quddus were executed for heresy. Waddah al-Yaman, now the national poet of Yemen, was also executed for his verse, but this was probably due to his over-familiarity with the wife of the caliph Al-Walid I.

Court poets were joined with court singers who simply performed works included Ibrahim al-Mawsili, his son Ishaq al-Mawsili and Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi son of caliph al-Mahdi. Many stories about these early singers were retold in the &quot;Kitab al-Aghani&quot; or &quot;Book of Songs&quot; by Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani.

The Sufi tradition also produced poetry closely linked to religion. Sufism is a mystical interpretation of Islam and it emphasised the allegorical nature of language and writing. Many of the works of Sufi poets appear to be simple &quot;ghazal&quot; or &quot;khamriyyah&quot;. Under the guise of the love or wine poem they would contemplate the mortal flesh and attempt to achieve transcendence. Rabia al-Adawiyya, Abd Yazid al-Bistami and Mansur al-Hallaj are some of the most significant Sufi poets, but the poetry and doctrine of al-Hallaj was eventually considered heretic for saying &quot;I am the Truth,&quot; which came to be compared as literal incarnation. Al Hallaj was crucified and later became known as a Martyr.

The caliph himself could take on the role of court poet with al-Walid II a notable example, but he was widely disliked for his immorality and was deposed after only a year.

===&quot;Badi″&quot; poetry===
An important doctrine of Arabic poetry from the start was its complexity, but during the period of court poetry this became an art form in itself known as &quot;badi`&quot;. There were features such as metaphor, pun, juxtaposing opposites and tricky theological allusions. Bashshar ibn Burd was instrumental in developing these complexities which later poets felt they had to surpass. Although not all writers enjoyed the baroque style, with argumentative letters on the matter being sent by Ibn Burd and Ibn Miskawayh, the poetic brinkmanship of &quot;badi&quot; led to a certain formality in poetic art, with only the greatest poets&#x27; words shining through the complex structures and wordplay. This can make Arabic poetry even more difficult to translate than poetry from other languages, with much of a poet&#x27;s skill often lost in translation.

==Christian poetry==
Already before the arrival of Islam, Arab Christians composed poetry with biblical or Christian topics, such as Adi ibn Zayd who wrote poetry on the creation narrative and other biblical or Christian motives. According to the church historian Sozomen, odes composed in Arabic celebrating the victory of queen Mavia over emperor Valens may not only be the earliest account of oral Christian poetry but also the earliest account of Arabic poetry in general. 

Under Islamic rule, though forced to live with certain restrictions, Arab Christians such as Al-Akhtal al-Taghlibi or Ibn al-Tilmidh continued to use Arabic for their poetry. However, these poets seldom addressed their personal Christian faith in their works.

Other ethnicities under Arab rule adapted Arabic poetry over the coming centuries. In ninth century Spain, Paulus Alvarus complained that Christian youths preferred Arabic poetry to Latin works. Hafs ibn Albar, who has been sometimes identified as Paulus&#x27; son, translated the psalms into Arabic in rhyme form, using rajaz verses as it resembled the metre used by Christians in the iambic verse. The translation and many other works enjoyed great popularity not only among Christians but also among Islamic and Jewish authors in Spain. 

Arabic poetry was also used for apologetics. As such, the eleventh century Andalusi abu &#x27;qasim ibn Al-Hayyat, originally a Muslim theologian, wrote a poem in defence of his conversion to Christianity.

The early eleventh-century bishop Sulayman al-Ghazzi holds a unique place in the history of Arab Christian literature as author of the first diwan of Christian religious poetry in Arabic. The collection consists of over 3,000 lines loosely structured in 97 qaṣīdas which deal with biblical, theological, ascetical, and personal themes such as the persecution Palestinian Christians suffered under caliph al-Hakim.

==Poetic genres==

===Romantic poetry===

Another medieval Arabic love story was &quot;Hadith Bayad wa Riyad&quot; (&quot;The Story of Bayad and Riyad&quot;), a 13th-century Arabic love story written in al-Andalus. The main characters of the tale are Bayad, a merchant&#x27;s son and a foreigner from Damascus, and Riyad, a well-educated girl in the court of an unnamed Hajib of al-Andalus (vizier or minister), whose equally unnamed daughter, whose retinue includes Riyad, is referred to as the Lady. The &quot;Hadith Bayad wa Riyad&quot; manuscript is believed to be the only illustrated manuscript known to have survived from more than eight centuries of Muslim and Arab presence in Spain.

There were several elements of courtly love which were developed in Arabic poetry, namely the notions of &quot;love for love&#x27;s sake&quot; and &quot;exaltation of the beloved lady&quot; which have been traced back to Arabic literature of the 9th and 10th centuries. The notion of the &quot;ennobling power&quot; of love was developed in the early 11th century by the Persian psychologist and philosopher, Ibn Sina (known as &quot;Avicenna&quot; in English), in his Arabic treatise &quot;Risala fi&#x27;l-Ishq&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Love&quot;). The final element of courtly love, the concept of &quot;love as desire never to be fulfilled,&quot; was also at times implicit in Arabic poetry.

The 10th century &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity&quot; features a fictional anecdote of a &quot;prince who strays from his palace during his wedding feast and, drunk, spends the night in a cemetery, confusing a corpse with his bride. The story is used as a gnostic parable of the soul&#x27;s pre-existence and return from its terrestrial sojourn.&quot;

Many of the tales in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; are also love stories or involve romantic love as a central theme, including the frame story of Scheherazade, and many of the stories she narrates, such as &quot;Aladdin,&quot; &quot;Ali Baba,&quot; &quot;The Ebony Horse&quot; and &quot;The Three Apples.&quot;

===Satirical poetry===
The genre of Arabic satirical poetry was known as &quot;hija&quot;. Biting satirical poetry was dreaded for its power to immortalize its subjects in insulting ways, and could include sexual, scatological, and religiously profane material. The only way to recover from a satirical insult delivered in poetry was to respond in kind, which meant naqa&#x27;id, or satirical duels involving exchanges of poems, were a distinctive part of early Arabic poetry.

In a tribal context, &quot;hija&quot; was often used to mock the poet&#x27;s enemies or the virtue of rival tribes. Court poets like Abu Nuwas also employed satire, lampooning political figures like the vizier Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya. After leaving Egypt, al-Mutanabbi mocked the eunuch ruler Abu al-Misk Kafur with a satirical poem: &quot;Till I met this eunuch, I always assumed that the head was the seat of wisdom, but when I looked into his intelligence, I discovered that all his wisdom resided in his testicles.&quot;

In the 10th century, the writer al-Tha&#x27;alibi recorded satirical poetry written by the poets as-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with as-Salami praising Abu Dulaf&#x27;s wide breadth of knowledge and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing as-Salami in return. Another 10th-century poet, Jarir ibn Atiyah, satirized Farazdaq by using the term &quot;Farazdaq-like&quot; to describe an individual who was a &quot;transgressor of the Shari&#x27;a&quot;. Abu Nuwas, in the 9th century, once responded to an insult from Hashim bin Hudayj, a philosopher, by composing verses sarcastically praising his wisdom, then imploring him to use his knowledge to explain how the penis functions.

===Poetic themes===
*&quot;Madih&quot;, a eulogy or panegyric
*&quot;Hija&quot;, a lampoon or insult poem
*&quot;Rithā&#x27;&quot;, an elegy
*&quot;Wasf&quot;, a descriptive poem
*&quot;Ghazal&quot;, a love poem, sometimes expressing love of men
*&quot;Khamriyyah&quot;, wine poetry
*&quot;Tardiyyah&quot;, hunt poetry
*&quot;Khawal&quot;, homiletic poetry
*&quot;Fakhr&quot;, boasting
*&quot;Hamasah&quot;, war poetry

===Poetic forms===

Poetry in Arabic is traditionally grouped in a &quot;diwan&quot; or collection of poems. These can be arranged by poet, tribe, topic or the name of the compiler such as the Asma&#x27;iyyat of al-Asma&#x27;i. Most poems did not have titles and they were usually named from their first lines. Sometimes they were arranged alphabetically by their rhymes. The role of the poet in Arabic developed in a similar way to poets elsewhere. The safe and easy patronage in royal courts was no longer available but a successful poet such as Nizar Qabbani was able to set up his own publishing house.

A large proportion of all Arabic poetry is written using the monorhyme, &quot;Qasidah&quot;. This is simply the same rhyme used on every line of a poem. While this may seem a poor rhyme scheme for people used to western literature it makes sense in a language like Arabic which has only three vowels which can be either long or short.

====&quot;Mu&#x27;rabbah&quot;, literary Arabic====
*&quot;Qarid&quot;
**&quot;Qit&#x27;ah&quot;, an elegy or short poem about an event
**&quot;Qasidah&quot;, an ode, designed to convey a message. A longer version of qit&#x27;ah
*&quot;Muwashshah&quot;, meaning &quot;girdled,&quot; courtly love poetry
*&quot;Ruba&#x27;i&quot; or &quot;dubayt&quot;, a quatrain
*&quot;Rajaz&quot;, a discourse in rhyme, used to push the limits of lexicography

====&quot;Malhunah&quot;, vernacular poetry====
*&quot;Kan ya ma kan&quot;, meaning &quot;once upon a time&quot;
*&quot;Quma&quot;
*&quot;Zajal&quot;, meaning &quot;shout&quot;
*&quot;Mawwal&quot; or &quot;Mawaliya&quot;, folk poetry in four rhyming lines
*&quot;Nabati&quot;, the vernacular poetry of the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula and the Syrian Desert.
*&quot;Humayni&quot;, the vernacular poetry of Yemen.

===Poetry theory and analysis===
Literary criticism in Arabic literature often focused on religious texts, and the several long religious traditions of hermeneutics and textual exegesis have had a profound influence on the study of secular texts. This was particularly the case for the literary traditions of Islamic literature.

Poetry analysis was also employed in other forms of medieval Arabic poetry from the 9th century, notably, for the first time, by the Kufan grammarian Tha&#x27;lab (d. 904) in his collection of terms with examples &quot;Qawa&#x27;id al-shi&#x27;r&quot; (&quot;The Foundations of Poetry&quot;), by Qudama ibn Ja&#x27;far in the &quot;Naqd al-shi&#x27;r&quot; (&quot;Poetic Criticism&quot;), by al-Jahiz in the &quot;al-Bayan wa-&#x27;l-tabyin&quot; and &quot;al-Hayawan&quot;, and by Abdullah ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz in his &quot;Kitab al-Badi&quot;. There were four critic groupings: experts on ancient poetry, critics of new Arabic poets, Quranic scholars, and Aristotelian logicians.

==Modern poetry==

===Arab Renaissance===
Beginning in the 19th century, as part of what is now called &quot;the Arab Renaissance&quot; or &quot;revival&quot; (), some primarily Egyptian, Lebanese and Syrian writers and poets Rifa&#x27;a at-Tahtawi, Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, Butrus al-Bustani, and Francis Marrash believed that writing must be renewed towards modern style and themes. The blind poet Francis Marrash wrote in poetic prose and prose poetry and can be considered the first modern Arabic writer. Within and after the Arabic Renaissance appeared several poetry movements and groups. 

===Neoclassicism===
The &quot;Neoclassical&quot; movement (different from the western neoclassicism) advocated return to the purity of classical Arabic poetry and began in the turn of the 20th century to explore the possibility of developing the classical poetic forms. Some of these neoclassical poets were acquainted with western literature but mostly continued to write in classical forms. One of the first proponents of this was the Egyptian poet and statesman Mahmoud Sami el-Baroudi. Other notable figures include Ahmad Shawqi (the most popular of them) and Hafiz Ibrahim from Egypt, Jamil Sidqi al-Zahawi and Maruf al-Rusafi from Iraq, and the Palestinian Ibrahim Tuqan.

A common genre in much of the neoclassical poetry was the use of the &quot;qasida&quot;, as well as &quot;ghazal&quot; or love poem in praise of the poet&#x27;s homeland. This was manifested either as a nationalism for the newly emerging nation states of the region or in a wider sense as an Arab nationalism emphasising the unity of all Arab people. The poems of praise (&quot;madih&quot;), and the lampoon (&quot;hija&quot;) also returned. Ahmad Shawqi produced several works praising the reforming Turkish leader Kemal Atatürk, but when Atatürk abolished the caliphate, Shawqi was not slow in attacking him in verse. Political views in poetry were often more unwelcome in the 20th century than they had been in the 7th, and several poets faced censorship or, in the case of Abd al-Wahhab al-Bayyati, exile.

===Romanticism===
The &quot;Romanticism&quot; (partly coincident with western neo-romanticism) was another Arab literary movement from the early 20th century, floureshed during the 1930s–1940s, that sought inspiration from French or English romantic poetry. Romantic poets, denouncing blind imitation of one-rhime system in classical poetry and its recurring themes, imaged individual experiences via powerful love &quot;ghasal&quot; and other genres. The precursor to this style became the Lebanese-Egyptian poet and journalist Khalil Mutran, more in his critical works.

Most famous part of Arab Romanticism or outstand movement related to it is the &quot;Mahjar&quot; (&quot;émigré&quot; school) that includes Arabic-language poets in the Americas Ameen Rihani, Kahlil Gibran, Nasib Arida, Mikhail Naimy, Elia Abu Madi, Fawsi Maluf, Farhat, and al-Qarawi. As their style example:
The romantic movement also involved poets in every Arabian country: Abdel Rahman Shokry, Abbas Mahmoud al-Aqqad and Ibrahim al-Mazini in Egypt, Omar Abu Risha in Syria, Elias Abu Shabaki and Salah Labaki in Lebanon, Abu al-Qasim al-Shabbi in Tunisia, and Al-Tijani Yusuf Bashir in Sudan.

Besides them, in Cairo in 1932, Ahmed Zaki Abu Shadi formed the literary &quot;Apollo Society&quot; with the magazine &quot;Apollo&quot;, that members were also Ibrahim Nagi, Ali Mahmoud Taha, and mentioned Abu al-Qasim al-Shabbi. This grouping absorbed some elements of literary modernism and avant-garde.

An example of modern poetry in classical Arabic style with themes of Pan-Arabism is the work of Aziz Pasha Abaza. He came from Abaza family which produced notable Arabic literary figures including Ismail Pasha Abaza, Fekry Pasha Abaza, novelist Tharwat Abaza, and Desouky Bek Abaza, among others.

===Symbolism===
The Symbolist school of poetry, close to Romanticism, was represented in the Arab world by the Lebanese poets Adib Mashar (1889–1928), Yusuf Ghusub (b. 1900) and Said Akl, and also Bishr Faris in Egypt. Ghusub with Akl, both, preached the use of Latin script. The mentioned above Romantic poet Salah Labaki was associated with them, aspecially in his critic works on the French literary theory.

===Modernism and avant-garde===
The development of modernist poetry also influenced poetry in Arabic. After World War II, there was a largely unsuccessful modernist movement by several poets to write poems in free verse (&quot;shi&#x27;r hurr&quot;). Thus, in 1947 the two Iraqi poets, Badr Shakir al-Sayyab and Nazik al-Malaika initiated a break in the stanza form (&quot;bayt&quot;) for free verse. The closer the Arab poets approached to Western poetry, the more anxious they became to look for new media, themes, techniques, metaphors and forms to liberate themselves from conventional poetry.

More recently, poets such as Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, Muhammad al-Maghut and Tawfiq Sayigh (d. 1971) have pushed the boundaries of stylistic experimentation even further in favour of prose poetry (&quot;qasidat al-nathr&quot;).

Avantgardist type prose poetry already took place among some romantics, such as Abu al-Qasim al-Shabbi, but became the trend with Yusuf al-Khal and Adunis, who founded the magazine &quot;Shi&#x27;r&quot; (&quot;Poetry&quot;) in Beirut in 1957 under the influence of al-Shabbi&#x27;s style and the &quot;Apollo&quot; journal in whole. Another avantgardist literary magazine in Beirut was the long-lived &quot;Al Adab&quot; (1953). Adunis from 1968 published his own journal &quot;Mawakif&quot; for literary innovations as follows:
===Surrealism===
Between the years 1938–1948, the Surrealist Cairo-based anti-fascist artistic Art et Liberté group was active, under the leadership of the poet Georges Henein. Shawqi&#x27;s granddaughter, poet Ikbal El-Alailly, was also a member. The work of these authors did not have a direct effect on Arabic poetry, because they wrote poems in European languages.

Arabic language Surrealist experiments proper belong to Orkhan Muyassar (1911?–1965) and Adunis in some his works.

===Contemporary poetry===
Poetry as a part of contemporary literature retains a very important status in the Arab world. Besides that, poets of &quot;commitment&quot; (&quot;iltizam&quot;), among them Abd al-Wahhab Al-Bayati, Khalil Hawi, and Mahmoud Darwish, played an important role in politics of the Arabian people along with an establishment of national states, revolutions, and the 1967 Six-Day War.

Iraqi poet Abd al-Wahhab Al-Bayati faced exile, due to his revolutionary ideas and advocacy for oppressed people, as in the following poem:
Mahmoud Darwish was regarded as the Palestinian national poet, and his funeral was attended by thousands of mourners. And here is an instance of political poetry of another Palestinian, Tawfiq Ziad:
The most widely read in the contemporary Middle East, Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani wrote during the 1950s and 1960s on social protest and politics, and even addressed less political themes in favour love poetry, but was regarded as a cultural icon and his poems provide the lyrics for many popular songs.

From the 1970s, there is a neo-Sufi trend within Arab poets, including some far left-wing figures.

Reality television poetry competitions like &quot;Prince of Poets&quot; and &quot;Million&#x27;s Poet&quot; exist to promote classical Arabic poetry and Nabati poetry respectively. Notable contestants in these competitions include Tamim al-Barghouti, Hissa Hilal, and Hisham al-Gakh.

<text>Charles Cecil Ingersoll Merritt VC, ED (10 November 1908 – 12 July 2000) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross for his actions during the Dieppe Raid in 1942. Later he served as Member of Parliament.

==Early life==

Merritt was born in Vancouver, British Columbia on 10 November 1908, the son of Captain Cecil Mack Merritt, who was killed in the Second Battle of Ypres, on 23 April 1915. He entered the Royal Military College of Canada, H1866 in 1925 at the age of 16 and graduated with honours.

==Career==
He was commissioned into the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada (a Militia regiment) in 1929. Merritt read for the Bar and became a barrister in 1932. He practised law in Vancouver until mobilized at the outbreak of World War II.

==Military service==
Merritt served as an officer in the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. At the outbreak of war, Merritt was promoted to the rank of major and in December sailed for England. In the next two years he held a variety of staff and regimental appointments and attended the War Staff Course at Camberley in June 1941.

From GSO2 of the 3rd Canadian Division, in March 1942, he was promoted to command The South Saskatchewan Regiment, Canadian Army, (Canadian Infantry Corps). Two months later, they moved to the Isle of Wight to train for the Dieppe raid.

Merritt led his regiment in the Dieppe raid on 19 August 1942. Before being taken as a prisoner of war, Merritt was wounded twice. For his extreme bravery and inspirational leadership under fire, Merritt was awarded the Victoria Cross.

Two experienced British Commando units (Numbers 3 and 4) were assigned to land before dawn to destroy German heavy gun batteries on promontories east and west of the port, a task in which they were largely successful. Two Canadian battalions were scheduled to land at the same time to the immediate east and west of Dieppe to give land ward support to the attacks on the guns and to form a secure perimeter for the main force to land.

The right flank Canadian battalion assigned to Green Beach was the South Saskatchewan Regiment commanded by Merritt. His objectives were Pourville, west of the port, then the cliffs above the village.

His force crossed the Channel in Royal Navy destroyers, transferred to landing craft 10 miles offshore and reached Green Beach on time, in near darkness and unopposed. But the main part of the battalion was landed on the wrong side of the River Scie estuary and faced crossing a narrow bridge through Pourville in order to approach their objectives on the cliffs.

By then alert to the situation, the German defenders targeted the bridge with machine-gun and mortar fire. Initial Canadian attempts failed to storm the bridge, leaving it covered with dead and wounded. Merritt led the next rush forward, waving his steel helmet with the rallying shout, &quot;Come on over. There&#x27;s nothing to it!&quot;

His audacity took the enemy by surprise; one group of men followed him over the bridge and others used the girders to cross. Merritt soon had most of his surviving men on the far bank, but shortage of mortar ammunition and lack of communications to the destroyers to call for supporting fire made any further advance impossible.

Meanwhile, the company landed on the west bank of the Scie had reached its objective and sent a success signal to the operation command ship. This and one from Lord Lovat&#x27;s Number 4 Commando were the only two success signals sent in the entire operation.

Finding all moves towards his objectives blocked by concrete pillboxes, Merritt led an attack on each in turn, personally killing the occupants of one by throwing grenades through the enemy&#x27;s firing ports. When the last enemy strong point had been silenced, Merritt had been twice wounded and his battalion reduced to fewer than 300 men.

He held on to an improvised perimeter nevertheless, and kept contact with his section positions by moving from one to another after his runners had been killed. When the time came to move back to the beach, Merritt coolly gave instructions for an orderly withdrawal and announced his intention to hold off the enemy from a rearguard position in a small bandstand near the beach to cover the re-embarkation.

The South Saskatchewan battalion left 84 dead on Green Beach and 89 more, including Merritt and eight other officers, were taken prisoner. His citation for award of the Victoria Cross concluded: &quot;To this commanding officer&#x27;s personal daring the success of his unit&#x27;s operations and the safe re-embarkation of a large portion of it were chiefly due.&quot;

Merritt was sent to prison camp Oflag VII-B at Eichstätt in Bavaria. Together with 64 others, he escaped through a 120 ft tunnel during the night of 3–4 June 1943. All were recaptured after a massive manhunt. Merritt was sentenced to 14 days&#x27; solitary confinement before being transferred to Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle. He remarked after being freed: &quot;My war lasted six hours. There are plenty of Canadians who went all the way from the landings in Sicily to the very end.&quot; He was dismissive of his time as a prisoner of war with the words: &quot;It was an enforced idleness. It cannot be translated into virtue.&quot;

In recognition of Merritt being the Commanding Officer of The South Saskatchewan Regiment during Operation Jubilee, four streets in the Rosemont neighbourhood of Regina were named in his honour. Charles Crescent, Cecil Crescent, Ingersoll Crescent, and Merritt Crescent.

Merritt is also remembered by a road called Merritt Drive in the City of Windsor, Ontario - the city which provided the Essex Scottish Regiment who assaulted &#x27;Red Beach&#x27;, Dieppe, as the South Saskatchewans were assaulting &#x27;Green Beach&#x27; It is next to Tilston Drive, which refers to Major Fred Tilston VC, of the Essex Scottish Regiment who received his VC in Germany in 1945.

==Postwar==
After taking his release from military service in 1945, Merritt served as a Member of Parliament, being elected to the House of Commons of Canada, serving the electoral district of Vancouver—Burrard from 1945 to 1949.

Returning from Ottawa, he resumed his law practice in Vancouver and served as Commanding Officer of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada from 1951 to 1954; he later was Honorary Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment from 1963 to 1966.

Merritt served on the board of directors of Mount Pleasant War Memorial Community Cooperative Association from 1950 to 1994.

He became a valued rugby player for the Meraloma Rugby Club. Brother officers spoke with awe of his skill at the informal hockey game shinny.

==Family==
In 1937, he married Grace Graham, the daughter of Jamieson Bone of Belleville, Ontario; they had two sons and a daughter.

==Death and burial==
LCol Merritt died at the age of 91 in Vancouver on 12 July 2000.

He was buried at Ocean View Cemetery, 4000 Imperial Street, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada in the Royal Section, Plot 49, Grave #5.

==Medals==
The LCol Merritt, V.C., medal set, which consists of the Victoria Cross, the 1939–45 Star, the Defence Medal, the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal with Overseas and Dieppe clasps, the British War Medal 1939–45 with Mentioned in Despatches (MID), the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal 1953, the Canadian Centennial Medal 1967, the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal 1977, the Canada 125th Anniversary Medal and the Efficiency Decoration with Canada Bar, was donated to the Canadian War Museum, Ottawa, some time after his death on 12 July 2000.

==Legacy==

Merritt, a graduate of the Royal Military College of Canada, is listed on the Wall of Honour in Kingston, Ontario.

Four streets in the City of Regina, the capital of Saskatchewan, are named in honour of Merritt. Charles Crescent, Cecil Crescent, Ingersoll Crescent, and Merritt Crescent.

The bridge over the River Scie in Pourville, where Merrit earned the VC, was renamed in his honour for the 50th anniversary of the raid in 1992.

In 2017, the First Year Flight of Montcalm Squadron was renamed from Savage Flight to Merritt Flight, in honour of this most distinguished graduate.

<text>General Foods Corporation was a company whose direct predecessor was established in the United States by Charles William (C. W.) Post as the Postum Cereal Company in 1895.

The company changed its name to &quot;General Foods&quot; in 1929, after several corporate acquisitions, by Marjorie Merriweather Post after she inherited the established cereal business from her father, C. W. Post. In November 1985, General Foods was acquired by Philip Morris Companies (now Altria) for $5.6 billion, the largest non-oil acquisition at the time. In December 1988, Philip Morris acquired Kraft Foods Inc., and, in 1990, combined the two food companies as Kraft General Foods. The &quot;General Foods&quot; name was dropped in 1995 with the corporate name being reverted to Kraft Foods; a line of caffeinated hot beverage mixes continued to carry the General Foods International name until 2010.

== History ==
=== Background ===
General Foods background can be traced to the Post Cereal Company, founded by C. W. Post in 1895 in Battle Creek, Michigan. Post was a patient at the Battle Creek Sanitarium (run by John Harvey Kellogg, brother of Kellogg Company founder Will Keith Kellogg). Post was inspired by the diet there to start his food company (and become a rival to the Kellogg brothers, who sold their own breakfast cereals). He invested $78 in his initial equipment and supplies and set up manufacturing in a barn on what was known as the &#x27;Old Beardsley Farm&#x27;. His first product was Postum, a &quot;cereal beverage&quot; alternative to coffee made from wheat and molasses. The first cereal, Grape-Nuts, was developed in 1897 followed by Elijah&#x27;s Manna in 1904, which was renamed Post Toasties in 1908.

In 1907 &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; published an article questioning the claim made in advertisements for Grape Nuts that it could cure appendicitis. C. W. Post responded with advertisements questioning the mental capacity of the article&#x27;s author, and &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; sued for libel. The case was heard in 1910, and Post was fined $50,000. The decision was overturned on appeal, but advertisements for Postum products stopped making such claims.
=== General Foods ===

C.W. Post died in 1914, and his daughter Marjorie Merriweather Post took over the company. The Postum Cereals company acquired others such as Jell-O (gelatin dessert) in 1925, Walter Baker &amp; Company (chocolate) in 1927, Maxwell House (coffee) in 1928, and other food brands.

By far the most important acquisition in 1929 was of the frozen-food company owned by Clarence Birdseye, called &quot;General Seafood Corporation&quot;. Birdseye (December 9, 1886 - October 7, 1956) was one of the most important entrepreneurs in the history of the food industry. Born in New York City, he became interested in the frozen preservation of food during the course of working as a fur trader in Labrador between 1912 and 1916. By 1923, he had developed a commercially viable process for quick-freezing foods using a belt mechanism, which he patented. In 1924, with backing from three investors, he formed the &quot;General Seafoods Company&quot; in Gloucester, Massachusetts to produce frozen haddock fillets packed in plain cardboard boxes.
The founder&#x27;s daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, was the first to become excited about the prospects for the frozen foods business. In 1926, she had put into port at Gloucester on her yacht, &quot;Sea Cloud&quot;, and was served a luncheon meal which, she learned to her amazement, had been frozen six months before. Despite her enthusiasm, it took Post three years to convince Postum&#x27;s management to acquire the company. Postum paid $10.75 million for a 51% interest and its partner, Goldman Sachs, paid $12.5 million for the other 49%. Following this acquisition, Postum, Inc changed its name to General Foods Corporation. Goldman sold its share back to General Foods in 1932, apparently at a slight loss.

Shortly after the acquisition, General Foods began test-marketing an expanded line of frozen foods, but the company quickly realized that a packaging process alone would not be sufficient to market frozen products in stores. To be sold, the packages had to be kept frozen while on display, so Birdseye engineers began development of a freezer cabinet designed specifically to hold frozen foods. The cabinet, which first appeared in 1934, required a great deal of space and electricity, which were not readily available in most grocery stores of the period. For those stores that could accommodate them, the payback was immediate. Housewives quickly realized that keeping packages of frozen food in the icebox could mean fresher meals and fewer trips to the market.

The company published a cookbook in 1932 called the &quot;General Foods Cook Book&quot; dedicated &quot;To the American homemaker&quot;. Five editions were published between 1932 and 1937. The book includes photographs (among which is &quot;General Foods offers over twenty famous products for your well-stocked pantry shelf&quot;) and a subject index.

General Foods acquired the Perkins Product Company, the makers of Kool-Aid, in 1953, Burger Chef in 1968, Oscar Mayer in 1981, Entenmann&#x27;s in 1982, Oroweat in 1984, and the Freihofer baking company in 1987. The company then sold Burger Chef to Imasco, owner of Hardee&#x27;s, in 1981.

General Foods was acquired by Philip Morris Companies (now Altria) in 1985. In 1989, Phillip Morris merged General Foods with Kraft Foods Inc., which it had acquired in 1987, to form the Kraft General Foods division. The cereal brands of Nabisco were acquired in 1993. In 1995 Kraft General Foods was reorganized, and the Kraft Foods name was restored. On November 15, 2007, Kraft announced it would spin off Post Cereals and merge that business with Ralcorp Holdings. That merger was completed August 4, 2008, at which time the official name of the company became Post Foods, LLC.

<text>Její pastorkyňa (&quot;Her Stepdaughter&quot;; commonly known as Jenůfa ) is an opera in three acts by Leoš Janáček to a Czech libretto by the composer, based on the play &quot;Její pastorkyňa&quot; by Gabriela Preissová. It was first performed at the National Theatre, Brno on 21 January 1904. Composed between 1896 and 1902, it is among the first operas written in prose.

The first of Janáček&#x27;s operas in which his distinctive voice can clearly be heard, it is a grim story of infanticide and redemption. Like the playwright&#x27;s original work, it is known for its unsentimental realism. While today it is heard in the composer&#x27;s original version, &quot;Jenůfa&quot;&#x27;s early popularity was due to a revised version by Karel Kovařovic, altering what was considered its eccentric style and orchestration. Thus altered, it was well-received, first in Prague, and particularly after its Vienna première also worldwide. More than 70 years passed before audiences again heard it in Janáček&#x27;s original version.

Janáček wrote an overture to the opera, but decided not to use it. It was partly based on a song called &quot;Žárlivec&quot; (&quot;The jealous man&quot;). It is now performed as a concert piece under the title &quot;Žárlivost&quot; (&quot;Jealousy&quot;), JW 6/10.

The composer dedicated the work to the memory of his daughter Olga (d. 1903), as he did his choral composition the &quot;Elegy on the Death of Daughter Olga&quot;.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
:Place: A Moravian village
:Time: the nineteenth century

The plot depends on a tangled set of village relationships. Before the opera begins, the mill-owner Grandmother Buryja had two sons. The elder married the widow of a man named Klemeň, became stepfather to her son Laca, and had a son of his own with her, Števa. The younger married twice, and had a daughter, Jenůfa, with his first wife. When the opera opens, Grandmother Buryja&#x27;s sons and their wives have died, except for the Kostelnička (the sacristan or sextoness of the village church), the younger son&#x27;s second wife and Jenůfa&#x27;s stepmother. Custom dictates that Števa alone, as the elder son&#x27;s only child, will inherit the mill, leaving his half-brother Laca and cousin Jenůfa to earn their livings.

===Act 1===
Jenůfa, Laca, and Grandmother Buryja wait for Števa to return home. Jenůfa, in love with Števa and secretly pregnant with his child, worries that he may have been drafted into the army. Laca, in love with Jenůfa, expresses bitterness against his half-brother&#x27;s favored position at home. As he complains he plays with a knife and, finding it blunt, gives it to the mill foreman to be sharpened.

The foreman informs the family that Števa has not been drafted, to Jenůfa&#x27;s relief and Laca&#x27;s increased frustration. The others leave, and Jenůfa waits to greet Števa. He appears with a group of soldiers, drunk and boasting of his prowess with the girls. He calls for music and drags the miserable Jenůfa into dancing with him.

The Kostelnička steps into this rowdy scene, silences the musicians and, shocked by Števa&#x27;s behavior, forbids him to marry Jenůfa until he can stay sober for one full year. The soldiers and the family leave Števa and Jenůfa alone, and she begs him to love her, but he, unaware of her pregnancy, gives her casual answers and leaves.

Laca returns, as bitter as ever. He attempts to goad Jenůfa into criticizing Števa, but she takes her lover&#x27;s side despite everything. Laca rages that Števa would never even look at her if it weren&#x27;t for her rosy cheeks, then slashes her across the cheek with his knife.

===Act 2===
Months later, it is winter. The baby has been born, but Števa has not yet come to visit his child. Jenůfa&#x27;s face is still disfigured, but she is happy in her love for the baby. While Jenůfa sleeps, the Kostelnička summons Števa and demands that he take responsibility. He answers that while he will provide money in secret, no one must know the baby is his. His love for Jenůfa died when Laca spoiled her beauty, and he is now engaged to marry Karolka, the mayor&#x27;s pretty daughter.

Števa leaves, and Laca enters. He still doesn&#x27;t know the truth about the baby, and when the Kostelnička tells him, his first reaction is disgust at the thought of taking Števa&#x27;s child under his wing. Fearful that Jenůfa will be left with no one to marry, Kostelnička hastily lies that the baby is dead. Laca leaves, and the Kostelnička is faced with the necessity of making the lie true. She wraps the baby in a shawl and leaves the house.

Jenůfa wakes up and says a prayer for her child&#x27;s future, but the Kostelnička, returning, tells her that the baby died while she slept. Laca appears and comforts Jenůfa gently, asking that they spend the rest of their lives together. Seeing the tenderness of the couple, the Kostelnička tries to convince herself that she has acted for the best.

===Act 3===
It is now spring, and Laca and Jenůfa&#x27;s wedding day. All seems right again, except that the Kostelnička is a nervous wreck. Števa and Karolka visit, and a chorus of village girls sings a wedding song. Just then, screams are heard. The body of the baby has been discovered in the mill-stream under the melting ice. Jenůfa immediately says that the baby is hers, and in her grief appears guilty of the murder. The village is ready to exact immediate justice against Jenůfa, but the Kostelnička calms them and says that the crime is hers. Hearing the whole story, Jenůfa forgives her stepmother. The crowd takes the Kostelnička off to jail. Jenůfa and Laca are left alone. Jenůfa asks Laca to leave her, as she cannot expect him to marry her now. He replies that he will not leave her, and that he wishes to spend the rest of his life with her.

<text>Bourgeois tragedy (German: &quot;Bürgerliches Trauerspiel&quot;) is a form of tragedy that developed in 18th-century Europe. It is a fruit of the enlightenment and the emergence of the bourgeois class and its ideals. It is characterized by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens.

==In England and France==
There are a few examples of tragic plays with middle-class protagonists from 17th century England (see domestic tragedy), but only in the 18th century did the general attitude change. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play: George Lillo&#x27;s &quot;The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell&quot;, which was first performed in 1731. 

In France, the first &quot;tragédie bourgeoise&quot; was &quot;Sylvie&quot; by Paul Landois, which came out in 1741. Years later came two plays by Denis Diderot: &quot;Le fils naturel&quot; was first staged in 1757 and &quot;Le père de famille&quot; in the following year; while these plays were not strictly tragedies, they treat bourgeois lives in a serious manner atypical of contemporary comedy and provided models for more genuinely tragic works.

==Heroes in classical tragedy==
While ordinary people had always been the subject of comedies, classical and neo-classical theorists asserted that tragic heroes should always be men of noble rank. Aristotle articulates this idea in &quot;ars poetica&quot; (&quot;The Poetics&quot;) and it figures prominently in later ancient writings on drama and poetics. 

Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century critics, including the influential German Martin Opitz, perpetuated the theory that only members of the higher classes were capable of suffering harm serious enough to deserve dramatic reenactment. This rule was followed throughout Europe for centuries: usually, princes and members of the nobility, such as Andreas Gryphius&#x27; Carolus Stuardus (i.e. King Charles I of England), Jean Racine&#x27;s Phèdre (the wife of Theseus, a mythical king of Athens) or William Shakespeare&#x27;s King Lear, serve as tragic protagonists.

==In Germany==
In Germany, where the new genre was called &quot;Bürgerliches Trauerspiel&quot;, it was especially successful. Usually, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing&#x27;s play &quot;Miss Sara Sampson&quot;, which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest &quot;Bürgerliches Trauerspiel&quot; in Germany. However, Christian Leberecht Martini&#x27;s drama &quot;Rhynsolt und Sapphira&quot; is slightly older. 

Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Emilia Galotti&quot; of 1771 is a classic example of the German Bürgerliches Trauerspiel. Lessing also offered a thorough theoretic justification for his disregard of the old rules in his &quot;Hamburgische Dramaturgie&quot;. Other important examples of German Bürgerliche Trauerspiele are &quot;Die Soldaten&quot; by Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz (1776) and Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Kabale und Liebe&quot; (1784). 

==General characteristics==
Bourgeois tragedies tend to propagate the values of the bourgeois class to which their heroes belong. Their ideal is the virtuous citizen, who is excluded from state affairs and whose intentions are focused on his private life and the life of his family. Values like virtue, humanity, individuality and true feelings are cherished in bourgeois tragedies.

<text>The Deutsche Oper Berlin is a German opera company located in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin. The resident building is the country&#x27;s second largest opera house (after Munich&#x27;s) and also home to the Berlin State Ballet.

Since 2004, the Deutsche Oper Berlin, like the Staatsoper Unter den Linden (Berlin State Opera), the Komische Oper Berlin, the Berlin State Ballet, and the Bühnenservice Berlin (Stage and Costume Design), has been a member of the Berlin Opera Foundation.

==History==
The company&#x27;s history goes back to the &quot;Deutsches Opernhaus&quot; built by the then independent city of Charlottenburg—the &quot;richest town of Prussia&quot;—according to plans designed by Heinrich Seeling from 1911. It opened on 7 November 1912 with a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, conducted by Ignatz Waghalter. In 1925, after the incorporation of Charlottenburg by the 1920 Greater Berlin Act, the name of the resident building was changed to &quot;Städtische Oper&quot; (Municipal Opera).


With the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, the opera was under control of the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. Minister Joseph Goebbels had the name changed back to &quot;Deutsches Opernhaus&quot;, competing with the Berlin State Opera in Mitte controlled by his rival, the Prussian minister-president Hermann Göring. In 1935, the building was remodeled by Paul Baumgarten and the seating reduced from 2,300 to 2,098 places. Carl Ebert, the pre-World War II general manager, chose to emigrate from Germany rather than endorse the Nazi view of music, and went on to co-found the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in England. He was replaced by Max von Schillings, who acceded to demands that he enact works of &quot;unalloyed German character&quot;. Several artists, like the conductor Fritz Stiedry and the singer Alexander Kipnis, followed Ebert into emigration. The opera house was destroyed by a Royal Air Force air raid on 23 November 1943. Performances continued at the Admiralspalast in Mitte until 1945. Ebert returned to serve as general manager after the war.

After the war, in what had now been called West Berlin, the company, again called &quot;Städtische Oper&quot;, used the nearby Theater des Westens; its opening production was &quot;Fidelio&quot;, on 4 September 1945. Its home was finally rebuilt in 1961 but to a much-changed, sober design by Fritz Bornemann. The opening production of the newly renamed &quot;Deutsche Oper&quot;, on 24 September, was Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.

On the evening of 2 June 1967, Benno Ohnesorg, a student taking part in the German student movement, was shot in the streets around the opera house. He had been protesting against the visit to Germany by the Shah of Iran, who was attending a performance of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;.

Past &quot;Generalmusikdirektoren&quot; (GMD, general music directors) have included Bruno Walter, Kurt Adler, Ferenc Fricsay, Lorin Maazel, Gerd Albrecht, Jesús López-Cobos, Giuseppe Sinopoli, and Christian Thielemann. In April 2001, Sinopoli died at the podium while conducting &quot;Aida&quot;, at age 54. In October 2005, Renato Palumbo was appointed GMD as of the 2006–2007 season. In October 2007, the Deutsche Oper announced the appointment of Donald Runnicles as their next &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot;, effective August 2009, for an initial contract of five years. Simultaneously, Palumbo and the Deutsche Oper mutually agreed to terminate his contract, effective November 2007. In November 2020, the company announced the most recent extension of Runnicles&#x27; contract as its GMD, through 2027. In September 2023, the Deutsche Oper Berlin announced that Runnicles is to stand down as its GMD at the close of the 2025-2026 season, one season earlier than his most recent contract extension, at Runnicles&#x27; own request. 

The current &quot;Intendant&quot; (artistic director) of the company is Dietmar Schwarz, and his current contract with the company is through 31 July 2025. The current executive director of the company is Thomas Fehrle, who is currently contracted with the company through 2027. In February 2023, the company announced the appointment of Aviel Cahn as its next &quot;Intendant&quot;, effective 1 August 2026.

==Idomeneo controversy==

In September 2006, the Deutsche Oper&#x27;s then-&quot;&quot; (general manager) Kirsten Harms drew criticism after she cancelled the production of Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Idomeneo&quot; by Hans Neuenfels, because of fears that a scene in that production featuring the severed heads of Jesus, Buddha and Muhammad would offend Muslims, and that the opera house&#x27;s security might come under threat if violent protests took place. (This is a departure from the original libretto, in which there is no such scene.) Critics of the decision include German Ministers and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The reaction from Muslims was mixed. The leader of Germany&#x27;s Islamic Council welcomed the decision, whilst a leader of Germany&#x27;s Turkish community, criticising the decision, said:

: &quot;This is about art, not about politics ... We should not make art dependent on religion – then we are back in the Middle Ages.&quot;

At the end of October 2006, the opera house announced that performances of Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Idomeneo&quot; would then proceed.

<text>The mongongo tree, mongongo nut or manketti tree (Schinziophyton rautanenii) is a member of the family Euphorbiaceae and the monotypic genus Schinziophyton.

Native to Africa, the fruits produce an edible nut.

== Description ==

A large, spreading tree, the mongongo reaches tall. The leaves are a distinctive hand-shape, and the pale yellow wood is similar in characteristics to balsa, being both lightweight and strong. The yellowish flowers occur in slender, loose sprays.

The fruits are known as &quot;mongongo fruits&quot;, &quot;mongongo nuts&quot;, &quot;manketti nuts&quot; or &quot;nongongo&quot;. The egg-shaped, velvety fruits ripen and fall between March and May each year, and contain a thin exocarp around a thick, hard, pitted shell containing an edible nut.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus of &quot;Schinziophyton&quot; was circumscribed by Josh Hutcherson ex. Alan Radcliffe-Smith in Kew Bull.

The genus name of &quot;Schinziophyton&quot; is in honour of Hans Schinz (1858–1941), who was a Swiss explorer and botanist and was a native of Zürich.

===Phylogenetics===
Within the Ricinodendreae tribe, mongongo is an early clade according to phylogenetic research.


== Distribution and habitat ==
The mongongo is distributed widely through subtropical southern Africa. There are several distinct belts of distribution, the largest of which reaches from northern Namibia into northern Botswana, south-western Zambia and western Zimbabwe. Another belt is found in eastern Malawi, and yet another in eastern Mozambique.

It is also found in Angola, Tanzania, and Zaire.

It is found on wooded hills and among sand dunes, and is associated with the Kalahari sand soil-types.

==Uses==

=== Nutrition ===
Per 100 grams shelled nuts:
* 24 g protein
* 57 g fat:
** 44% polyunsaturated fatty acids
** 18% monounsaturated fatty acids
** 17% saturated fatty acids
* 193 mg calcium
* 527 mg magnesium
* 4 mg zinc
* 2.8 mg copper
* 565 mg vitamin E (tocopherol)

=== Culinary ===

Mongongo nuts are a staple diet in some areas, most notably among the San people of northern Botswana and Namibia. Archaeological evidence has shown that they have been consumed by the San communities for centuries. Their popularity stems in part from their flavor, and in part from the fact that they store well, and remain edible for much of the year.

Dry fruits are first steamed to soften the skins. After peeling, the fruits are then cooked in water until the maroon-colored flesh separates from the hard inner nuts. The pulp is eaten, and the nuts are saved to be roasted later. Alternatively, nuts are collected from elephant dung; the hard nuts survive intact through the digestive process after the elephant has consumed and digested them. Once dry, the outer shell cracks easily, revealing the nut, encased within a soft inner shell. The nuts are either eaten intact, or pounded as ingredients in other dishes.

The oil from the nuts has also been traditionally used as a body rub in the dry winter months to clean and moisten the skin. The wood, being both strong and light, makes excellent fishing floats, toys, insulating material and drawing boards.

== In culture ==
In 1968, Canadian anthropologist Richard Borshay Lee wrote:

A diet based on mongongo nuts is in fact more reliable than one based on cultivated foods, and it is not surprising, therefore, that when a Bushman was asked why he hadn&#x27;t taken to agriculture he replied: &quot;Why should we plant, when there are so many mongongo nuts in the world?&quot;

<text>Econet was Acorn Computers&#x27;s low-cost local area network system, based on a CSMA-CD serial protocol carried over a five-wire data bus, intended for use by schools and small businesses. It was widely used in those areas, and was supported by a large number of different computer and server systems produced both by Acorn and by other companies.

Econet software was later mostly superseded by the TCP/IP-based &quot;Acorn Universal Networking&quot; (AUN), though some suppliers were still offering bridging kits to interconnect old and new networks. AUN was in turn superseded by the &quot;Acorn Access+&quot; software.

== Implementation history ==

Econet was specified in 1980, and first developed for the Acorn Atom and Acorn System 2/3/4 computers in 1981. Also in that year the BBC Micro was released, initially with provision for floppy disc and Econet interface ports, but without the necessary supporting ICs fitted, optionally to be added in a post sale upgrade.

In 1982, the Tasmania Department of Education requested a tender for the supply of personal computers to their schools. Earlier that year Barson Computers, Acorn&#x27;s Australian computer distributor, had released the BBC Microcomputer with floppy disc storage as part of a bundle. Acorn&#x27;s Hermann Hauser and Chris Curry agreed to allow it to be also offered with Econet fitted, as they had previously done with the disc interface. As previously with the Disc Filing System, they stipulated that Barson would need to adapt the network filing system from the System 2 without assistance from Acorn. Barson&#x27;s engineers applied a few modifications to fix bugs on the early BBC Micro motherboards, which were adopted by Acorn in later releases. With both floppy disc and networking available, the BBC Micro was approved for use in schools by all state and territory education authorities in Australia and New Zealand, and quickly overtook the Apple II as the computer of choice in private schools.

With no other supporting documentation available, the head of Barson&#x27;s Acorn division, Rob Napier, published &quot;Networking with the BBC Microcomputer&quot;, the first reference documentation for Econet.

Econet was officially released for the BBC Micro in the UK in 1984, and it later became popular as a networking system for the Acorn Archimedes. Econet was eventually officially supported on all post-Atom Acorn machines, apart from the Electron (except in Australia and New Zealand where Barson Computers built their own Econet daughterboard), along with third-party ISA cards for the IBM PC. The &quot;Ecolink&quot; ISA interface card for IBM-compatible PCs was available. It used Microsoft&#x27;s MS-NET Redirector for MS-DOS to provide file and printer sharing via the NET USE command.

File, Print and Tape servers, for the architecture were also supplied by third-party vendors such as S J Research.

Econet was supported by Acorn MOS, RISC OS, RISC iX, FreeBSD and Linux operating systems.

Acorn once received an offer from Commodore International to license the technology, which it refused.

=== Subsequent development ===
With the falling prices and widespread adoption of IP networking in the early 1990s, Acorn Universal Networking (AUN), an implementation of Econet protocols and addressing over TCP/IP (in Acorn&#x27;s words &quot;an AUN network is a conformant TCP/IP network underneath the Econet-like veneer&quot;), was developed to provide legacy support for Econet on Ethernet-connected machines.

Support for the Econet protocol and AUN was removed from the Linux kernel in 2012 from version 3.5, due to lack of use and privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

== Supported systems ==
Econet was supported by a large number of different computer and server systems, produced both by Acorn and by other companies. As well as Acorn&#x27;s MOS and RISC OS these also used other operating systems such as CP/M, DR-DOS, Unix, Linux or Microsoft Windows.

The Econet API includes an codice_1 command, which can be used by software to determine if a machine is present on the network and its hardware platform. The machine-type codes which can be returned by that command
are a useful indication of the range of hardware that offered Econet as their primary networking function or as an option:


The manual includes an assembly language program to report a machine type, software version and release numbers.

An update to the list in volume 5A of the PRM
lists the following additions to the table above:


== Physical and data-link layers ==
Econet is a five-wire bus network composed of one or more segments (up to 127), where each segment may be up to 500m long. One pair of wires is used for the clock signal to synchronise devices on the network, one pair for data, and one wire as a common ground. In many but not all implementations, a dedicated external board is required to supply the clock signal known as the &quot;clock box&quot;, usually positioned in the middle of the network. Some Econet devices have an internal capability to generate the clock signal. Signalling used the RS-422 5-volt differential standard, with one bit transferred per clock cycle. Unshielded cable was used for short lengths, and shielded cable for longer networks. The cable was terminated at each end to prevent reflections and to guarantee high logic levels when the bus was undriven.

The original connectors were five-pin circular 180° DIN types. On later 32-bit machines (notably the A3020 and A4000), the Econet connection was made via five of the pins on their 15-pin D-type &quot;Network&quot; port, which could also accept MAUs (Media Attachment Units) to allow other types of network to be connected via the same socket. This port looks similar to an AUI port, but is not compatible. The Acorn A4 laptop used another implementation, in the form of a 5 pin mini-DIN.

Each Econet interface was controlled by a Motorola MC68B54 Advanced Data Link Controller (ADLC) chip, which handled electrical transmission/reception, frame checksumming and collision detection.

== Network and transport layers ==
Econet used a connectionless transmission model, similar to UDP, with no checksumming or error correction at this layer. Each packet had a four byte header consisting of:
# The destination station number
# The destination network number
# The source station number
# The source network number

A single data transmission consisted of four frames, each with a header as above:
# The sending station sends a &quot;scout&quot; packet with a port number and a flag byte
# The addressed receiving station returns a &quot;scout acknowledge&quot; to the sender
# The sending station sends the &quot;data&quot;
# The receiving station finishes with a &quot;final acknowledge&quot;, identical to the &quot;scout acknowledge&quot;

Each device on a network segment is identified by a &quot;station ID&quot; number which serves a similar purpose to a MAC address. The address is not set at time of manufacture but is set manually and a network administrator must ensure addresses do not collide when new machines are installed. In the BBC Micro the station ID is set using jumper pins on the motherboard. Conventionally a file server would be assigned station ID 254 but there is no specific requirement for this to be the case.

There was provision for &quot;broadcast transmissions&quot;, a single frame sent with its destination station and network numbers set to 255. There was also provision for promiscuous mode reception, termed &quot;wild receive&quot;
in the PRM, requested by listening for station and network numbers both being zero.

Technical details of packets and frames, the Econet API, and worked examples in ARM assembler and BBC BASIC
are given in the RISC OS Programmer&#x27;s Reference Manual.

== Network services ==
At the time and in the markets for which Econet was developed, the main purpose of computer networking was to provide local area shared access to expensive hardware such as disc storage and printers. Acorn provided software for the BBC Micro to implement a file server, and optionally a printer server also. The original file server was very basic, essentially allowing limited access to a floppy disc over the network. The server software was further developed over many years, and Acorn and other manufacturers also produced dedicated Econet servers based on various technologies. So the servers available fell into roughly three categories:

* The Acorn Fileserver, from Level 1 through Level 4, running on a standard computer (BBC, Master or Archimedes) and providing simple file and print services.
* The dedicated Acorn Filestore units, running on dedicated hardware with higher capacity and more facilities.
* Third party units (notably from SJ Research), again running on dedicated hardware and with their own implementations of the server software. These were compatible with the Acorn implementations, but with additional enhancements. (Notably, Oak Solutions collaborated with Acorn to develop the Level 4 Fileserver solution.)

The machine type numbers listed in the &quot;Supported systems&quot; section above are an indication of the range of hardware that was available or planned.

Additional services could be implemented, using the network API provided. Short utilities such as network chat programs were often published in magazines or distributed by sharing among users; these made use of the Econet protocols to work alongside the basic file and print services. Larger software packages (some of them commercial) were available that provided services such as Teletext and modem drivers.

=== Filestore ===
Acorn emphasised the Filestore in the late 1980s as a solution for small workgroups, offering a base unit with optional hard disk storage modules. The device was similar in concept to what is now termed Network Attached Storage, being a standalone unit dedicated to serving files over a network.

The Filestore was a 65C102-based machine with 64 KB of RAM, 64 KB of ROM, Econet connectivity, two 3.5&quot; floppy drives, a parallel printer interface, expansion bus, Econet clock and termination circuits, a real-time clock, and a quantity of battery-backed RAM. The battery-backed RAM was used to hold configuration and authentication details.

Initially, hard disk expansion was offered in the form of the E20 module providing a 3.5&quot; 20 MB Winchester disk drive (hard disk) for the E01 base unit; later expansions in the form of the E40S and E60S provided 40 MB and 60 MB storage respectively for the E01S base unit. The &quot;S&quot; suffix reportedly signifies that the units are &quot;stacking&quot;.

=== Fileserver ===
Acorn also offered the Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 Fileserver solutions running on sufficiently upgraded BBC Micro or BBC Master computers. 

The Level 1 product offered access to existing Acorn DFS discs via a BBC Model B with Econet, a disc interface and single or dual drives. Printer sharing was also possible. This was intended for small networks, typically in an educational setting, to solve a narrowly defined problem of sharing what were at the time expensive peripherals. An Econet upgrade originally cost significantly less than a disk drive. The only available access control mechanism was that files for each station (client) on the network could be isolated from each other but anyone with physical access to the relevant station could access the files. Typically each station would only be able to access a small number of files, with only 31 files being stored in total on a side of one floppy disk and split between all of the stations.

Level 2 delivered significant enhancements over level 1 but elevated the system requirements for the file server host machine to necessitate a 6502 second processor unit with 64K RAM. Hierarchical directories were possible with the number of files limited only by the amount of storage available, enhanced access controls, random access to data files, and authentication support. 

Level 3 introduced Winchester hard drive support.

With the release of the Level 4 Fileserver software providing a means to &quot;extend the life of existing Acorn computers, such as the A310&quot;, allowing &quot;any Archimedes computer to act as a fileserver&quot;, the emphasis had evidently shifted away from the Filestore and towards the Level 4 product at the start of the 1990s. A base Filestore E01S unit had a price inclusive of VAT of £1148.85 in February 1989, whereas an Archimedes 310 with 1 MB of RAM cost only £958.00 and an Econet module £56.35, illustrating the pricing considerations for potential buyers. By 1991, the Filestore was apparently no longer offered in Acorn&#x27;s pricing (nor was the A310), but the Level 4 software was priced at £233.83 and an Archimedes 410/1 with 1 MB of RAM at £1049.33.

=== Unix system services ===
With the introduction of Acorn&#x27;s Unix workstations running RISC iX, an envisaged application for Econet was the use of Master 128 computers acting as terminals to these Unix systems. Such systems also offered the capability to act as bridges between Econet and Ethernet networks, offering routing facilities to any Unix machines attached to the Econet, this being enabled by the IP-over-Econet support in RISC iX.

=== X.25 network services ===
An Econet X.25 gateway product was offered by Acorn, providing access to X.25 networks for computers on an Econet, with the X25 Terminal ROM and the existing Acorn DNFS ROM needing to be fitted to computers to enable access to X.25 services, with the Terminal ROM providing terminal emulation and file transfer functionality.

The gateway hardware consisted of the core functionality of a BBC Micro, this being the &quot;network service module&quot; connected to the Econet, combined with a Z80 second processor connected via the Tube interface, this acting as the &quot;gateway module&quot; and having 16 KB ROM and 32 KB of private RAM, augmented by another board with a Z80 processor with 32 KB of private RAM, this being the &quot;X25 module&quot; accessing the X.25 line. The gateway and X25 modules communicated via 16 KB of dual-ported shared RAM. The X25 module was designed by Symicron and ran the &quot;proven&quot; Symicron Telematics Software (STS).

Econet users would send &quot;network service&quot; requests to the gateway that would be forwarded by the STS functionality of the gateway to the X.25 network. Incoming X.25 calls would be forwarded by the STS functionality to the network service functionality and on to the Econet. Network service requests could employ X.25, Yellow Book Transport Service, and X.29 protocols.

== Comparison with modern systems ==

While Econet was essentially specific to the Acorn range of computers, it does share common concepts with modern network file systems and protocols:

* &quot;Remote Procedure Call&quot; – Almost all network operations were performed via a primitive remote procedure call system, either by passing a command line direct to the file server, or by passing an operating system call parameter block. The logon command *I AM was processed by passing the whole command line and reading back the result code.
* &quot;Access Permissions&quot; – By the time of the Acorn Level 4 File Server and the SJ Research MDFS systems, Econet file servers had a full user name and password system with public and private attributes. These worked similar to Unix permissions without the group field. Files could be set to be readable and/or writable by everyone, just by the user, or both.
* &quot;Subnetting&quot; – A basic Econet would be a single network segment, which is usually assumed to be network 0. With the use of one or more bridges, it is possible to have up to 127 Econet segments with up to 254 hosts each, for a maximum of 32,258 possible machines.
* &quot;Broadcasting&quot; – By using host 255, an Econet host could send broadcast packets to all hosts on the network segment. Later implementations of the client software used this to automatically locate file and printer servers.
* &quot;Printer Spooling&quot; – Later versions of the Econet printer server software used printer spooling to locally cache print jobs before sending to the remote printer. This ensured whole print jobs were sent to the printer in one go.
* &quot;Ports&quot; – Because the various protocols (file and printer servers, bridge discovery, and so forth) used defined port numbers, it was possible to for additional services such as BroadcastLoader, AppFS, a teletext server, and a range of chat programs and multiplayer games to coexist within the Econet system.

<text>Roy Quentin Echlin Evans (born 4 October 1948) is an English former footballer who played as a defender for Liverpool, where he also had a spell as manager. Aside from his time at Liverpool, he had a short spell in the United States; and also managed Fulham and Swindon Town.

==Career==
An England schoolboy international, Evans was a defender who was a long way down the pecking order at Liverpool in the 1960s and 1970s—he also spent the summer of 1973 in the North American Soccer League with the Philadelphia Atoms. In 1974 he gave up his playing career to become Liverpool&#x27;s reserve team coach and was subsequently part of the Liverpool coaching team under a succession of managers.

===Liverpool manager===
On 28 January 1994, Graeme Souness quit as Liverpool manager in the wake of a shock FA Cup exit at the hands of Bristol City. Evans took over as manager of a Liverpool side who were mid-table in the Premier League and out of contention for any major honours, although they were 8th by the end of the season. Evans had inherited a side from Souness that had lost confidence in the three years following Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s departure, as well as a side that was mismatched largely due to the signings that Souness made.

For the 1994–95 season, Evans strengthened his side with the addition of defenders John Scales and Phil Babb as well as young winger Mark Kennedy. He also gave further first-team opportunities to youngsters Steve McManaman, Jamie Redknapp and Robbie Fowler, who at the time were among the hottest prospects in English football. Established players such as John Barnes, Mark Wright and Ian Rush blended well with these young stars as Liverpool finished fourth in the Premier League with 74 points and triumphed in the Football League Cup, beating Bolton Wanderers 2–1 with two McManaman goals, and winning the competition for a record fifth time.

Over the summer of 1995, Evans made the headlines by paying a British record fee for Nottingham Forest striker Stan Collymore. Many observers tipped Liverpool to win the Premier League title for that season, particularly as defending champions Blackburn had promoted Kenny Dalglish to Director of Football and appointed the less successful Ray Harford as manager, and runners-up Manchester United had sold three key players and surprisingly relied on young players to fill their place. Although Liverpool looked like contenders during the first stages of the season, the title race had effectively become a Newcastle United-Manchester United contest by Christmas, with Manchester United finally clinching the title. Liverpool, meanwhile, had to settle for third place in the league; any lingering hopes of title glory were finished off towards the end of April with a shock defeat by Coventry City. They did reach the FA Cup final, but lost 1–0 to a late Eric Cantona goal for Manchester United. As United had done the double, Evans and his exciting young team would be competing in the 1996–97 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Nonetheless, their League position had improved from 4th to 3rd on the previous attempt. This had happened despite collecting only 71 points; however, the league notably had been reduced by 4 games that season. The 71 points was equivalent to 78.5 points the season before.

The 1996–97 season in English football proved to be the closest Evans would come to winning the Premier League title. Evans strengthened his side that was built around McManaman and Fowler, with the acquisition of Czech midfielder Patrik Berger over the summer of 1996, but by the end of the 1996–97 season all the talk around Anfield was about a promising 17-year-old striker, Michael Owen, who had shown tremendous potential in a handful of games for the club. Liverpool had led the Premier League on several occasions before the end of January, even having a five-point lead at the top of the table in January, but eventually finished poorly in fourth place, while Manchester United clinched the title by a seven-point margin. Their European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup adventure ended in the semi-finals when they lost to Paris St Germain. They had also collected 3 points fewer overall, finishing with 68, with much of the press berating the club for a lack of discipline off the field, dubbing Evans&#x27; squad the Spice Boys for their lifestyles off the pitch, which affected their performances on it. In the last game of that season, against Sheffield Wednesday, Liverpool failed to win, with Owen hitting the post late on. Had he scored Liverpool would have finished second and had the opportunity to play in the following season&#x27;s European Cup.

With Stan Collymore moving to Aston Villa in the close season, Evans did not want to throw Owen into the first team, so he brought in midfield hardman Paul Ince, and legendary German striker Karlheinz Riedle to partner the prolific Robbie Fowler. Liverpool appeared ready to mount a strong title challenge in 1997–98 season, however, an injury to Fowler, that lasted for the majority of the season, prevented the team from making the most of its potential. Owen burst onto the scene with 18 goals in 36 Premier League games. Nevertheless, they again collected 3 points fewer than the previous season for the 3rd straight season (65 total) and had to settle for third place in the league and yet another UEFA Cup campaign.

In 1998 Liverpool&#x27;s longstanding Boot Room coach Ronnie Moran retired and was set to be replaced by Gerrard Houllier for the 1998–99 season onwards. It was decided that Houllier would become joint manager of Liverpool to work alongside Evans, but the arrangement was not a success and Evans resigned in November to leave Houllier in sole charge. Houllier would remain at the club until 2004, collecting one FA Cup, one UEFA Cup and two League Cups in that time.

===Liverpool legacy===

When Roy Evans took over from Graeme Souness in 1994 the team was in rapid free-fall. In his first full season (1994–95) Liverpool finished 4th with 74 points. At this point it seemed that he had reversed the decline that had set in under the Souness regime, and the &#x27;glory days&#x27; would soon be returning. However, the team was to finish the next three seasons with three points fewer than the previous season (1995–96, 1996–97, 1997–98), suggesting that after an initial &#x27;honeymoon&#x27; things quickly stagnated. The period of joint management with Gerard Houllier was a radical effort by the board to reverse that stagnation. By 1998 Evans had assembled a talented nucleus of players, who were particularly impressive going forward and in their attacking football, where Evans had been credited with creating arguably the nation&#x27;s most exciting and aesthetically pleasing team of the 1990s.

===After Liverpool===
Evans was out of work for over a year. His name was linked with Nottingham Forest following their relegation from the Premier League at the end of the 1998–99 season, but the job went to David Platt instead. He also lost out in the race to become Bolton Wanderers manager in 1999, with the club appointing former player Sam Allardyce. His comeback finally came in March 2000 when he became joint caretaker manager of Fulham alongside Karlheinz Riedle until Jean Tigana was given the job a month later.

In June 2001, Evans was named Director of Football at Swindon Town in Division Two, with 33-year-old former Liverpool defender Neil Ruddock as player-coach. But the pair failed to inspire a promotion challenge at the County Ground, and on 20 December 2001 they were succeeded by new manager Andy King.

In November 2004, when former Liverpool striker John Toshack was appointed as the new manager of Wales, Evans accepted an offer to be his assistant.

In February 2007, he accepted an offer to become part-time assistant manager to Brian Carey at League Two strugglers Wrexham, and helped Wrexham avoid relegation to the Conference National. After Wrexham escaped relegation from League Two at the end of the 2006–07 season, this agreement was extended.

As well as his coaching commitments, he also currently acts as a co-commentator for live audio broadcasts of Liverpool matches on the official web site, www.liverpoolfc.tv. Evans also co-operated on his authorised biography, called &quot;Ghost on the Wall&quot;, which was released at the end of 2004.

<doc id="1227768" wikidata="Q3112791" url="?curid=1227768" title="Hyper-Calvinism">
<text>Hyper-Calvinism is a branch of Protestant theology that places a strong emphasis on God&#x27;s sovereignty at the expense of human responsibility. It is at times regarded as a variation of Calvinism, but critics emphasize its differences from traditional Calvinistic beliefs. Hyper-Calvinism distinguishes itself from traditional Calvinism when it comes to the &quot;sufficiency and efficiency&quot; of Christ&#x27;s atonement. Predestination in Calvinism traditionally argues that only the elect are able to understand Christ&#x27;s atonement, but that the sufficiency of the atonement stretches to all humanity, while Hyper-Calvinism argues the atonement is sufficient only to the elect.

The term originated in the 19th century as a sometimes-pejorative descriptor predated by terms such as &quot;false Calvinism&quot; and &quot;High Calvinism&quot;. The term can be used vaguely, and its distinction from traditional Calvinism is not always clear; writers such as Jim Ellis have suggested that Hyper-Calvinism as a concept is sometimes applied broadly to denominations more theologically conservative than the speaker&#x27;s, rather than to a consistent theological stance. Nonetheless, Hyper-Calvinism is distinguished as a distinct theological branch, associated with figures such as the 18th-century theologian John Gill.

==Definitions==
Peter Toon notes that the expression &quot;Hyper-Calvinism&quot; came to be generally used in the 19th century, while the terms &quot;False Calvinism&quot; and &quot;High Calvinism&quot; were used near the end of the 18th century to define the same doctrinal views. &quot;High Calvinism&quot; has sometimes been used as a synonym for Hyper-Calvinism, and at other times as a synonym for the Calvinism of the Canons of Dort (1619). Although the doctrine of limited atonement is taught in the Canons of Dort, the term &quot;Hyper-Calvinism&quot; in previous generations has been used to define those who reject the view that the atonement is sufficient for all mankind or that there is a general design in the death of Christ.

===Historic definitions of the term===
In his publication from 1825, George Croft defined Hyper-Calvinism as holding to a particular design of Christ&#x27;s death and denying a general design. He also notes that Hyper-Calvinists were generally styled High-Calvinists because they had views above genuine Calvinism: denying that the death of Christ was &quot;in any respect&quot; intended for the salvation of all, not inviting all to believe in Christ for salvation, contending that invitations should only be given to the &quot;willing&quot;, and holding to antinomian doctrines, which tend to discourage holiness. In a &quot;Protestant Dictionary&quot; from 1904, Charles Neil defined Hyper-Calvinism as a view that maintains the theory of limited atonement and limits the scope of gospel invitations to the elect.

===Modern definitions of the term===
Modern definitions of Hyper-Calvinism usually distinguish it from points of Calvinism, such as limited atonement or supralapsarianism. There is not, however, unanimity regarding the definition.

Curt Daniel defines Hyper-Calvinism as &quot;that school of supralapsarian Five Point Calvinism which so stresses the sovereignty of God by overemphasizing the secret [will of God] over the revealed will [of God] and eternity over time, that it minimizes the responsibility of Man, notably with respect to the denial of the word ‘offer’ in relation to the preaching of the Gospel of a finished and limited atonement, thus undermining the universal duty of sinners to believe savingly with assurance that the Lord Jesus Christ died for them.&quot; Daniel goes on to suggest that the real difference between &quot;High&quot; and &quot;Hyper-&quot; Calvinism is the word &quot;offer&quot;

Iain Murray adopts a different approach, putting the emphasis on the denial of a &quot;universal command to repent and believe&quot; and the assertion &quot;that we have only warrant to invite to Christ those who are conscious of a sense of sin and need.&quot;

Jim Ellis argues that &quot;adequately defining what constitutes the fundamental error of hyper-Calvinism&quot; is problematic because many definitions &quot;blur the distinction between it and legitimate Calvinism&quot;, and most of them include an apparent bias against Five Point Calvinism. Ellis goes on to say that Hyper-Calvinism &quot;consists of two fundamental errors: a denial of duty-faith and a resultant denial of the universal call of the gospel.&quot;

==Adherents==
The term &quot;Hyper-Calvinist&quot; is sometimes used as a pejorative; Jim Ellis suggests that &quot;it seems as if anyone to the right of one&#x27;s own theological position is fair game to be labeled a hyper-Calvinist.&quot; Notwithstanding this, people who have been described as Hyper-Calvinists include John Skepp (d. 1721), Lewis Wayman (d. 1764), John Brine (d. 1765), and John Gill (d. 1771). Additionally, The Gospel Coalition described the Westboro Baptist Church of Fred Phelps as a Hyper-Calvinist church.

David Engelsma notes that his own denomination, the Protestant Reformed Churches in America, has been labelled as &quot;Hyper-Calvinist&quot; for its rejection of the &quot;well-meant offer of the gospel&quot;. Engelsma disputes this label, and says that Hyper-Calvinism is instead &quot;the denial that God in the preaching of the gospel calls everyone who hears the preaching to repent and believe... that the church should call everyone in the preaching... that the unregenerated have a duty to repent and believe.&quot;

==Differences from orthodox Calvinism==

===Hyper-Calvinism doctrine===
The beliefs which have been termed &quot;Hyper-Calvinism&quot; may be seen in historic writings of numerous Calvinistic ministers and in the Gospel Standard Articles of Faith (See Articles 24, 26, 27, 28 and 29). The Hyper-Calvinism of these articles arose in part as a reaction to the Amyraldism of men like Richard Baxter. According to J. I. Packer, Baxter &quot;devised an eclectic middle route between Reformed, Arminian, and Roman doctrines of grace: interpreting the kingdom of God in terms of contemporary political ideas, he explained Christ&#x27;s death as an act of universal redemption (penal and vicarious, but not substitutionary), in virtue of which God has made a new law offering pardon and amnesty to the penitent. Repentance and faith, being obedience to this law, are the believer&#x27;s personal saving righteousness.&quot;

====The Gospel Standard Articles of Faith and statements by ministers====
Denial of sufficient grace in the atonement for all persons&lt;br&gt;Article 28 states a rejection of the general redemption view of Richard Baxter and a denial that there is a residue of grace in Christ for non-elect persons if they will only accept it. The Baptist minister Daniel Whitaker reasoned against &quot;Baxterianism&quot; and defined it as the teaching that Christ died intentionally for the elect only, but sufficiently for the rest. He believed that the Baxterian view allowed a possible and probable salvation for non-elect persons from the sufficiency of the death of Christ. John Stevens, also a Baptist minister, affirmed that the atonement is &quot;insufficient&quot; to save those whom Christ never intended to save. He reasoned that Christ has never benefited any person &quot;unintentionally&quot; and that his meritorious worth should not be divided or confounded.

Denial of indiscriminate offers of the gospel to all persons&lt;br&gt;Article 24 states a confession that invitations of the gospel are only for sensible sinners who are made aware of their need for Christ. Article 27 states a denial that the non-elect are ever enlightened by the Holy Spirit to receive grace. Article 29 states a confession that the gospel is to be preached in all the world without indiscriminate offers of the gospel to all. The English Baptist pastor John Gill denied that there are universal offers of grace made to any, but that grace and salvation are published and revealed in the gospel. The English Anglican Church pastor Robert Hawker contended that Jesus only invited the weary and heavy laden. He believed that it is in &quot;direct contradiction to scripture&quot; to invite all. He also reasoned that an attempt to offer Christ is &quot;little short of blasphemy&quot; and those who make invitations to allure the carnal world to faith and repentance know not the scriptures nor the power of God.

Denial of duty-faith&lt;br&gt;Article 26 states a confession that the natural man should not be given exhortation or duties to &quot;spiritually and savingly&quot; repent and believe. Article 26 has been a subject of controversy concerning what was intended. In his book &quot;What Gospel Standard Baptists Believe&quot;, J.H. Gosden clarifies that this article is not meant to minimize the sin of unbelief. He understood this article to be a denial that man is duty bound to believe &quot;each individual is himself&quot; included in the redemption work of Christ and he affirmed that man is &quot;inexcusable in his unbelief&quot; against God&#x27;s revealed word and works. The Baptist pastor William Styles reasoned that duty-faith blends the covenant of works with the covenant of grace and makes faith a work of the law. W. Kitchen reasoned in a Strict Baptists magazine that duty-faith would imply a universal design in the atonement by calling on all persons to exercise a faith which grants them to believe Jesus gave himself for them.

===Orthodox Calvinistic doctrine===
While &quot;Hyper Calvinism&quot; reasons that the sufficiency of the atonement extends no further than its efficiency, &quot;Orthodox Calvinism&quot; reasons that Christ suffered sufficiently for the whole world, but efficiently only for the elect.

====John Calvin====
John Calvin denied that the sins of the reprobate have been expiated, but he maintained that Christ died sufficiently for the whole world and only efficiently for the elect. He affirmed that Jesus makes his favor &quot;common to all&quot; and offered &quot;indiscriminately to all&quot;, though not &quot;extended to all&quot;; for all do not receive him. He also stated that it is their unbelief which prevents anyone from receiving benefit from the death of Christ. With reference to God&#x27;s desire concerning the reprobate wicked, Calvin condemns the view of Georgius the Sicilian that &quot;God Would have all men to be saved&quot; and continues by saying &quot;It follows, therefore, according to his understanding of that passage, either that God is disappointed in His wishes, or that all men without exception must be saved … why, if such be the case, God did not command the Gospel to be preached to all men indiscriminately from the beginning of the world? why [did] He [suffer] so many generations of men to wander for so many ages in all the darkness of death?&quot;

====Confessions and catechisms====
The Canons of Dort affirm an abundant sufficiency in the death of Christ of &quot;infinite worth and value&quot; for the whole world. The word &quot;offer&quot; or &quot;free offer&quot; was used in the Westminster Standards and the Westminster Larger Catechism leaves no room for doubt that the phrase &quot;grace offered&quot; is used in reference to persons who &quot;never truly come&quot; to Christ. In his &quot;Question &amp; Answers on the Shorter Catechism&quot;, John Brown addressed and answered questions concerning the free offer of the gospel; he reasoned that God commands every person that hears the gospel to &quot;take his gift Christ out of his hand&quot;, that Christ offers himself &quot;Fully, freely, earnestly, and indefinitely&quot; to all persons that hear the gospel &quot;without exception&quot;, that this offer is for every person&#x27;s case &quot;as if he was named in it&quot; and that to embrace the offer of Christ is to be persuaded that &quot;Christ in the promise is mine.&quot;

==Opposition to the doctrine==
Both Calvinistic and non-Calvinistic ministers have expounded on several Bible passages as contradicting the doctrines which are considered to be Hyper-Calvinism. Verification that such scripture citations were a matter of doctrinal controversy may be seen in William Jeyes Styles&#x27; &quot;A Manual of Faith and Practice&quot;, Andrew Fuller&#x27;s &quot;The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation&quot;, John Gill&#x27;s &quot;The Cause of God and Truth&quot;, Richard Baxter&#x27;s &quot;Universal Redemption&quot;, Daniel Whitby&#x27;s &quot;A Discourse Concerning Election and Reprobation&quot; and William Button&#x27;s &quot;The Nature of Special Faith in Christ Considered&quot;. Arthur Pink wrote an article arguing for the doctrine of faith as the bounden duty of every person who hears the gospel.

=== Biblical references used in favor of orthodox Calvinism ===
* Matthew 23:37 &quot;...how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!&quot; Adam Clarke believed that here it is evident that there were persons whom Jesus &quot;wished to save, and bled to save&quot; who perished because they would not come unto him. Richard Baxter referred to this scripture as teaching that the cause of persons perishing is not &quot;for want of an expiatory Sacrifice&quot;, but &quot;for want of Faith&quot; to receive Christ and his benefits. John Calvin reasoned from this scripture that God &quot;calls all men indiscriminately to salvation&quot;, that he &quot;wills to gather all to himself&quot; and that this is distinct from his secret purpose to efficaciously gather whomsoever he wills. John Gill understood that Christ here expresses his &quot;will for their temporal good&quot; that they may be gathered under the ministry of his word and acknowledge him as the Messiah in order to preserve them from the &quot;temporal ruin&quot; threatened upon their city. He concludes that this scripture does not prove men resist the operations of God&#x27;s grace, but rather reveals the &quot;obstructions and discouragements&quot; that were &quot;thrown in the way&quot; of attendance to the ministry of his word.
* John 1:7 &quot;...that all men through him might believe.&quot; Albert Barnes noted on this scripture that John and Jesus came that &quot;we may all&quot; trust in Christ for salvation. John Calvin commented here that John came to prepare a church for Christ by &quot;inviting all&quot; to him. John Gill reasoned that the faith here required was not to believe Jesus died for them, but to acknowledge him as the Messiah. He also contended that souls who are made sensible of their lost state and &quot;need of a Savior&quot; ought to believe that Jesus died for them and &quot;none but such.&quot;
* John 3:16–17 &quot;...that the world through him might be saved.&quot; On this scripture, Richard Baxter interpreted the world which Jesus came to save to be divided into believers who will eventually be saved and unbelievers who will eventually be condemned. John Calvin stated that the word &quot;world&quot; is repeated here so that no man may consider himself &quot;wholly excluded&quot;, if he only &quot;keep the road of faith.&quot; John Gill commented here that the &quot;world&quot; is referring to the elect in general and in particular God&#x27;s people among the gentiles.
* Romans 3:22–23 &quot;...unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: For all have sinned...&quot; Adam Clarke commented here that all human creatures are &quot;equally helpless and guilty&quot; and therefore God&#x27;s &quot;endless mercy has embraced all.&quot; John Calvin stated here that Christ &quot;is offered to all&quot; and becomes an advantage only to believers. He also commented that the apostle Paul here &quot;urges on all, without exception&quot; concerning the &quot;necessity of seeking righteousness in Christ.&quot; John Gill understood these scriptures to refer to &quot;not all men,&quot; but to persons who &quot;believe in Christ for salvation&quot; and that there is no room here for any person to &quot;despair of the grace and righteousness of Christ&quot; on account of viewing themselves as the worst of sinners.
* Revelation 3:20 &quot;...if any man hear my voice, and open the door...&quot; Albert Barnes reasoned that this scripture is &quot;applicable to all persons&quot; and is the method by which Jesus seeks to come into the heart of a sinner. William Styles commented that this scripture is not referring to the unconverted, but rather regenerated persons of the church at Laodicea who were in &quot;a low and lukewarm state&quot; showing little regard for Christ. He understood the purpose of this appeal to be &quot;not salvation from the punishment of sin,&quot; but of communion with Christ.

Additional scriptures&lt;br&gt;John 5:34 is addressed by William Styles (A Manual of Faith and Practice, pg. 274). John 10:31 is addressed by William Styles (A Manual of Faith and Practice, pg. 245).

=== Biblical references used in favor of the concept of duty-faith ===
* Psalm 2:12 &quot;Kiss the Son, lest he be angry...&quot; Andrew Fuller concluded from this scripture that &quot;unconverted sinners are commanded to believe in Christ for salvation&quot; and that &quot;believing in Christ for salvation is their duty.&quot; William Button understood the phrase &quot;Kiss the Son&quot; as a duty to reverence Christ and the phrase &quot;Blessed are they&quot; to be an encouragement to those who are privileged to &quot;believe in him for pardon.&quot;
* John 12:36 &quot;While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light...&quot; Andrew Fuller stated that the belief which was required of these &quot;unbelievers&quot; would have &quot;issued in their salvation.&quot; William Styles understood &quot;believe in the light” to mean &quot;receive my testimony concerning Myself and My mission&quot; and that the title &quot;children of light&quot; intends &quot;Jews whose minds were informed by the teaching of Jesus&quot; and not &quot;spiritually illuminated persons.&quot;
* 2 Corinthians 5:17–21 &quot;...we pray you in Christ&#x27;s stead, be ye reconciled to God.&quot; Andrew Fuller reasoned that this scripture is spoken to &quot;rebellious subjects&quot; and to not &quot;submit&quot; to this mercy is to maintain &quot;the war.&quot; Albert Barnes, on this scripture, stated that &quot;ministers of reconciliation&quot; are to &quot;urge this duty on their fellow-men.&quot; John Calvin commented here that the phrase &quot;be reconciled&quot; is addressed to believers as a daily embassy &quot;sounded forth in the Church.&quot; John Gill commented on this scripture as referring to &quot;new creatures&quot; that Christ died for.
* 2 Thessalonians 1:8 &quot;...them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;
* 1 John 3:23 &quot;...this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ...&quot;

Additional scriptures&lt;br&gt; Isaiah 55:6–7 is addressed by William Button (The Nature of Special Faith in Christ Considered, pg. 30). Acts 16:30–31 is addressed by John Gill (The Cause of God and Truth, p. 574).

==Support for the doctrine==
Several bible passages are urged as supporting the doctrines which are considered to be Hyper-Calvinism. Verification that such scripture citations were a matter of doctrinal controversy may be seen in William Jeyes Styles&#x27; &quot;Baptist Manual Complete&quot;, Andrew Fuller&#x27;s &quot;The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation&quot;, John Gill&#x27;s &quot;The Cause of God and Truth&quot;, Richard Baxter&#x27;s &quot;Universal Redemption&quot;, Daniel Whitby&#x27;s &quot;A Discourse Concerning Election and Reprobation&quot; and William Button&#x27;s &quot;The Nature of Special Faith in Christ Considered&quot;.

=== Biblical references used to support the position of gospel invitations going to certain persons only ===
* Isaiah 55:1 &quot;Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters...&quot; John Gill taught that the persons here under the description of &quot;thirsty&quot; are spiritual persons &quot;thirsting after forgiveness of sin by the blood of Christ&quot; and to such is the gospel invitation given. Andrew Fuller believed that &quot;thirst&quot; here does not mean &quot;holy desire after spiritual blessings&quot; but rather a &quot;natural desire of happiness&quot; which God places in every bosom.
* Matthew 11:25–28 &quot;...Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden...&quot; John Gill reasoned from this scripture that the persons invited here are &quot;not all the individuals of mankind,&quot; but those who are &quot;burdened with the guilt of sin upon their consciences.&quot; John Calvin commented here that &quot;it would be in vain&quot; for Christ to invite those who are &quot;devoted to the world&quot; or those who are &quot;intoxicated with their own righteousness.&quot; On this verse, he also stated that Christ is &quot;ready to reveal the Father to all&quot; though the greater part is careless of coming to him.
* Mark 2:15–17 &quot;...I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.&quot; John Gill noted here that Christ &quot;attended the one, and not the other.&quot; He also stated that this scripture refers to the &quot;usefulness of Christ to one sort, and not another.&quot;
* Luke 4:18 &quot;...he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted...&quot;
* Revelation 22:17 &quot;...let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&quot;

=== Biblical references used against duty-faith ===
* Romans 4:13 &quot;...the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.&quot; The Baptist pastor Job Hupton concluded from this scripture that &quot;the eternal inheritance&quot; is not by &quot;the law and its duty,&quot; but through &quot;the gospel and its promises.&quot;
* Romans 4:16 &quot;...it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure...&quot; William Button made the argument here that &quot;if faith is a duty (and so a work)&quot; the apostle Paul should have rather said &quot;It is of faith that it might be by works.&quot; He concluded that there is a &quot;beauty&quot; here in the apostles words because faith is rather a &quot;blessing of the covenant of grace&quot; and a &quot;fruit of electing grace.&quot;
* Galatians 3:11–12 &quot;...the law is not of faith...&quot; The Baptist minister William Wales Horne asserted from this scripture that because faith is a grace of the Spirit, it is therefore not a duty of the law. He also reasoned that faith is not &quot;a duty which God requires of his people,&quot; but rather &quot;a grace which he gives them.&quot;
* Ephesians 2:8–9 &quot;...by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves...&quot; The English Baptist John Foreman made an argument here that their faith was not a &quot;duty produced of themselves&quot; or of a &quot;divine requirement,&quot; for God determined that his gift should &quot;not be of works, and so not of duty.&quot;
* 2 Timothy 1:9 &quot;...not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace...&quot; John Foreman reasoned from this scripture that grace is &quot;sovereign and particular only&quot; and that here is the reason why all men are not called and saved by God&#x27;s purpose and grace given before the world began. In light of this, he contended against the view that persons are &quot;damned for not coming&quot; to Christ for salvation.

<text>Element 14 Ltd. was a British developer of digital subscriber line (DSL) equipment created in July 1999 from the disposal of the assets of Acorn Computers. As &quot;a three-site startup&quot;, it combined teams from Acorn, Inmos/STMicroelectronics and Alcatel.

==History==
By January 1999, Acorn Computers Ltd. had renamed to Element 14 Limited to reflect the changed focus of the business and to distance itself from the education market that Acorn Computers was most known for. Other names had been considered by the company, but the domain name &quot;e-14.com&quot; had been registered before the official announcement.

During this time the ARM Holdings share value had increased to a point where the capital value of Acorn Group was worth less than the value of its 24% holding in ARM. This situation led shareholders to press Acorn to sell its stake in ARM Holdings to provide a return on their investment.

In May 1999, a deal was offered to Acorn Group plc shareholders by MSDW Investment Holdings Limited, a newly incorporated subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Group, in which the MSDW subsidiary would acquire Acorn by giving Acorn shareholders two ARM Holdings shares in exchange for every five Acorn Group shares being held.

As part of the disposal of Acorn&#x27;s assets, an independent company &quot;owned by Stan Boland and certain senior management&quot; were granted the option to purchase Acorn&#x27;s silicon and software design activity for £1 million subject to obtaining external financing. This company was effectively the independent Element 14 entity, which set about raising venture capital and subsequently secured £8.25 million in first-round funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, Atlas Ventures and Herman Hauser&#x27;s Amadeus Capital Partners.

In February 2000, Element 14 successfully head-hunted Alcatel&#x27;s top digital subscriber line (DSL) engineers, including designers of analogue front-end and digital ICs, xDSL modem software and specialists in asymmetric DSL (ADSL) and very high rate DSL (VDSL) systems, and thereby acquired an engineering centre in Mechelen, Belgium. This reflected a shift towards the companies targeting of the DSP technology away from Media and towards DSL markets.

Element 14 developed IPTV over standard phone lines and worked with telcos such as Canada&#x27;s NBTel. It continued to develop its DSP products until it was purchased by Broadcom Corporation in November 2000 for £366 million and Element 14 became Broadcom&#x27;s DSL business unit.

<text>William A. Mitchell (October 21, 1911 – July 26, 2004) was an American food chemist who, while working for General Foods Corporation between 1941 and 1976, was the key inventor behind Pop Rocks, Tang, Cool Whip, and powdered egg whites. During his career he received over 70 patents.

== Early life ==
He was born in Raymond, Minnesota. When he was a teenager, he ran the sugar crystallization tanks at the American Sugar Beet Company and slept two hours a night before getting to school. He earned an undergraduate degree at Cotner College in Lincoln, Nebraska and then graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in chemistry from the University of Nebraska.

== Career ==
Mitchell got a research job at an Agricultural Experiment Station in Lincoln, Nebraska. A lab accident there left him with second- and third-degree burns over most of his body. He joined General Foods in 1941. His first major success came with a tapioca substitute he helped develop during World War II, in response to the disruption of cassava supplies. Because of this, tapioca quickly became known as &quot;Mitchell mud&quot; within the US WW II infantry.

In 1957, he invented a powdered fruit-flavored vitamin-enhanced drink mix that became known as Tang Flavor Crystals. NASA started using Tang in 1962 in their space program.

In 1956, he tried to create instantly self-carbonating soda, which resulted in the creation of Pop Rocks. Although Pop Rocks weren&#x27;t sold until 1975, he received patent 3,012,893 for its manufacturing process in 1961.

In 1967, he introduced Cool Whip, which became the largest and most profitable line in its division very quickly.

He received 70 patents in total during his career. Mitchell was a resident of Lincoln Park, New Jersey for many years before moving out west after his retirement in 1976.

==Personal life==
He was married to Ruth Cobbey Mitchell and they had seven children. His daughter, Cheryl Mitchell, also became a food scientist. He moved to Stockton after Ruth&#x27;s death in 1999. Mitchell died of heart failure on July 26, 2004, at the age of 92 in Stockton, California, where he was living with his daughter.

<doc id="1227787" wikidata="Q552004" url="?curid=1227787" title="Pierre Victor Auger">
<text>Pierre Victor Auger (; 14 May 1899 – 24 December 1993) was a French physicist, born in Paris. He worked in the fields of atomic physics, nuclear physics, and cosmic ray physics. He is famous for being one of the discoverers of the Auger effect, named after him.

==Early life==
Pierre&#x27;s father was chemistry professor Victor Auger. Pierre Auger was a student at the École normale supérieure in Paris from 1919 to 1922, the year when he passed the agrégation of physics. He then joined the physical chemistry laboratory of the faculté des sciences of the University of Paris under the direction of Jean Perrin to work there on the photoelectric effect.

==Career==
In 1926, he obtained his doctorate in physics from the University of Paris. In 1927, he was named assistant to the faculté des sciences of Paris and, at the same time, adjoint chief of service to l&#x27;Institut de biologie physico-chimique. Chief of work to faculty in 1934 and general secretary of the annual tables of the constants in 1936, he was named university lecturer in physics to the faculty on the first of November 1937. He was charged with, until 1940, the course on the experimental bases of the quantum theory within the chair of theoretical physics and astrophysics. He was also adjoint director of the laboratory of physical chemistry. He then occupied the chair of quantum physics and relativity of the faculté des sciences of Paris.

At the end of World War II, he was named director of higher education from 1945 to 1948, which permitted him to introduce the first chair of genetics at the Sorbonne, conferred upon Boris Ephrussi.

The process where Auger electrons are emitted from atoms is used in Auger electron spectroscopy to study the elements on the surface of materials. This method was named after him, independently from Lise Meitner who discovered the process one year before in 1922, albeit in a different, and then controversial, context about the nature of the beta-rays versus Charles Drummond Ellis.

==Findings==
In his work with cosmic rays, he found that the cosmic radiation events were coincident in time meaning that they were associated with a single event, an air shower. He estimated that the energy of the incoming particle that creates large air showers must be at least 1015 electronvolts (eV) = 106 particles of 108 eV (critical energy in air) and a factor of ten for energy loss from traversing the atmosphere.

==Honors and achievements==
*He was European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) first Director General and one of the forefathers for the CERN foundation.

*He was president of the Centre international de calcul (Rome). From 1948 to 1959, he directed at UNESCO the department of mathematical and natural sciences.

*He was elected a member of the Académie des sciences in 1977.
*He hosted a broadcast of popularization of exacting science on Friday evenings on the public radio station France Culture from September 1969 to June 1986, entitled &quot;Les Grandes Avenues de la science moderne&quot;.

*The world&#x27;s largest cosmic ray detector, the Pierre Auger Observatory, is named after him.

<doc id="1227798" wikidata="Q3543817" url="?curid=1227798" title="Smith machine">
<text>The Smith machine is a weight machine used for weight training. It consists of a barbell that is fixed within steel rails allowing for only strict vertical movement. Some Smith machines have the barbell counterbalanced. The machine can be used for a wide variety of exercises including but not exclusive to; squats, the bench press, the shoulder press, good mornings and deadlifts.

==Use as a self-spotting device==
Behind each vertical post (runner) is a series of slots on which the barbell can be hooked. This means that unlike an ordinary barbell, the Smith machine need not be re-racked after a set of repetitions: it can be secured at any point. This is intended to make it safer for those who lift without a spotter, as one only needs to twist the wrist in order to lock the barbell in place in the event that the weight becomes too great. Most models also incorporate blocks, pegs, or other devices which can be adjusted to automatically stop the barbell at a predetermined minimum height.

This does not fully eliminate the inherent danger in having a heavy weight on one&#x27;s back, however, and may instill a false sense of confidence. In 2001, a Smith machine user became quadriplegic when the apparatus crushed his spine. Bench pressing while alone is dangerous in general, but even more so in a Smith machine; if one gets trapped under the bar, it cannot be rolled or tipped sideways off one&#x27;s chest or neck, which has led to at least one fatality.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Use of the Smith machine is frowned upon by many strength training devotees as it forces the user to adopt an unnatural straight-up-and-down &quot;bar path&quot;. This unnatural movement can cause shear stress on the knees and/or back when squatting or shoulders (if pressing).

The constrained movement of the bar also reduces the role that stabilizing muscles play versus an exercise using free weights. This may allow heavier weights to be lifted, at the expense of engaging less muscle mass overall. It is also hard to keep an accurate training log because manufacturers do not usually indicate bar weights.

As with other exercise machines, the Smith machine is often preferred by casual or inexperienced strength trainees who do not know how to safely perform free weight exercises involving heavy weights. Many gyms cater to casual trainees and thus may provide Smith machines instead of power racks, which are a piece of equipment critical for safely performing squats and other barbell-based free weight exercises.

The Smith machine does have some advocates amongst experienced trainees, however. The &quot;bar path&quot; issue is minimized for exercises involving a short range of travel such as calf raises and shrugs. It is potentially good for performing exercise variations when progress has slowed using other exercise forms, although care must be taken to avoid joint stress issues. The removal of stabilizing muscles as a factor can also allow one to increase the intensity applied to primary muscles.

== 3D Smith machine ==
A conventional Smith machine has one degree of freedom – the bar can move up and down in a straight line along a vertical track. (Rolling the bar is also typically used to activate the safety locks.) Some variant designs allow an additional degree of freedom – forward and back – while still keeping the bar from rotating or moving side to side. These machines are sometimes called &quot;3D Smith machines&quot; or &quot;Jones Smith machines&quot;.

A few designs, such as Shermworks&#x27; &quot;Free Spotter&quot; or TuffStuff&#x27;s &quot;XPT Training System&quot;, permit almost all degrees of freedom while still incorporating user-activated safety catches (as opposed to the passive, pre-set safeties of a power rack).

==Origin and history==
The Smith machine was invented by American Jack LaLanne, who rigged up a sliding apparatus in his gym in the 1950s. It was spotted by Rudy Smith, who commissioned Paul Martin to improve it. Smith then installed the modified model in a gym he was managing at the time, Vic Tanny&#x27;s gym in Los Angeles. By the end of the 1950s, Rudy Smith was an executive in Tanny&#x27;s chain of gyms, and the Smith machine was being manufactured and sold more widely.

==Effectiveness==
Research published in December 2009 reported that free weights triggered 43% more activation of the muscles than a Smith machine when performing squats.

<doc id="1227813" wikidata="Q7132007" url="?curid=1227813" title="PanzerBlitz">
<text>PanzerBlitz is a tactical-scale board wargame published by Avalon Hill in 1970 that simulates armored combat set on the Eastern Front of World War II. The game, which was the most popular board wargame of the 1970s, is notable for being the first true board-based tactical-level, commercially available conflict simulation wargame. It also pioneered several concepts that would become industry standards.

==Description==
&quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; simulates clashes between Soviet and German forces at the level of company-sized infantry for Russian units, and platoon-sized infantry for German units, as well as individual mechanized or motorized vehicles. This scale of simulation was new to wargaming, since previous wargames had focused on larger units such as brigades, regiments, and divisions.

Much of the strategy in &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; derives from the rule allowing units to shoot or move, but not both, in a single turn. Additionally, the difficulty of outright destruction of units encourages players to use combined arms rather than a simple concentration of one unit type to defeat the opponent.

The game includes technical information on the weight, speed, gun size, and crew complement of every major tank used on the Russian front. Additionally the battles - which were tactical fights - featured the detailed organizations of fairly small units, all the way from mortar teams to the trucks and wagons needed to give the units strategic flexibility. Much of this information had never been published before, outside of Army field manuals and partially classified intelligence reports.

It also pioneered concepts such as isomorphic mapboards and open-ended design, in which multiple unit counters are provided from which players can fashion their own free-form combat situations rather than simply replaying the published scenarios.

==Gameplay==
===Scale===
The game board hexes represent 250 meters, a turn is 6 minutes, the playing pieces represent companies and platoons.

===Innovative features===
&quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; introduced a number of innovations to board wargames:

# Geomorphic mapboards which can be arranged in various combinations to create different battlefields. This became a hallmark of Avalon Hill tactical games such as Squad Leader. Panzer Leader includes a beach board for invasion scenarios, while The Arab-Israeli Wars includes a canal board to represent the Suez Canal. From the release of &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; onward, wargamers started to call any modular game mapboard &quot;geomorphic&quot;, adding a new and peculiar meaning to that word.
# Armor units are represented by vehicle silhouettes rather than standard military symbols, making the game a departure from other operational level games as well as being reminiscent of miniatures games. Combined with bookcase-style packaging, it advanced Avalon Hill&#x27;s reputation for physical quality.
# The game is not limited to the 12 scenarios provided with it, but includes instructions for making a Design-Your-Own (DYO) scenario, or &quot;Situation 13&quot;. The Designer&#x27;s Notes shows players how many counters it will take to make up a complete Soviet Tank Corps, though this would require purchasing additional counter sets from Avalon Hill. (Players were advised against such extravagance, however, and urged to keep &quot;counter density&quot; low.) This open-ended approach made &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; a highly replayable game system, a feature widely emulated by subsequent games.
# The wealth of technical detail was unprecedented, as was the detailed description of how this technical data was incorporated into the game. The Designer&#x27;s Notes state, &quot;A glance at the &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; game components gives you the impression that you can pick up a considerable amount of historical data by just studying the game, much less actually playing it ... Unfortunately, you cannot take this data, as modified in the game design, at face value. Instead you must understand some of the decisions that were made about this game data before it was incorporated into the game.&quot;

===Design philosophy===
In spite of the heavy technical payload, the basic system is quite simple, an expression of Avalon Hill&#x27;s design philosophy in that playability and design elegance were prized above exactitude. The game mechanics are abstract and aimed at giving a realistic &quot;feel&quot; for armored combat rather than a completely accurate simulation.

===Simulation issues===
Although the abstract simplicity of &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; attracted a wide following, certain unrealistic aspects were heavily criticized.

*Panzerbush: A tank that ends its movement in a wooded hex is invisible unless an enemy unit is directly adjacent to it, even though the tank may have moved to that position in full view of the enemy, and fired from that position as well. This ability of units to hop from one woods hex to another without being attacked was called &quot;Panzerbush Syndrome&quot;, which became a scornful nickname for the game itself. The game provided a cumbersome optional rule to overcome this, but the later versions of the system (&quot;Panzer Leader&quot; and &quot;The Arab-Israeli Wars&quot;) provided much better solutions, such as the optional opportunity fire and more realistic rules for spotting and visibility. In addition in these later games systems, a hidden unit that fires on the enemy becomes visible and can be fired upon in return. 
*Truck burners: The game provides truck and wagon units to transport infantry and anti-tank guns. However, players used rule &quot;loopholes&quot; to develop other non-historical uses for trucks.:
**Spotter: A tank parked in woods is invisible unless an enemy unit is adjacent to it. Nothing in the rules prevents a player from driving a truck into the woods and parking it adjacent to the tank, which removes the tank&#x27;s invisibility, allowing the player owning the truck to fire with other units at the now-visible tank.
**Roadblock: The rules do not allow for tanks to move into hexes already occupied by enemy units unless the enemy units are located on clear terrain, in which case, the tank can use the &quot;overrrun&quot; rule. However, because roads are not considered clear terrain, the overrun rule does not apply, allowing a truck to be parked on a road as a roadblock to stop enemy tanks.

==Publication history==
In 1969, Avalon Hill dominated the wargame market, producing on average, one game per year with well-produced but expensive components. At the new wargame publisher Poultron Press, co-founder Jim Dunnigan and his design team decided to go in the opposite direction, marketing a number of very cheaply made &quot;Test Series&quot; games to see if producing many games a year could also be a viable business model. These test games featured typewritten pages with hand-drawn maps and graphics and thin paper counter sheets, packaged in a plain manila envelope. &quot;Tactical Game 3&quot;, also titled &quot;Test Series Game 3&quot;, designed by Dunnigan, was sent to playtesters in 1969. Later the same year, a second printing was included as a free pull-out game in Issue 22 of Poultron Press&#x27;s house magazine &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot;, becoming the first tactical wargame in the history of modern board wargaming.

In 1970, Dunnigan sold the rights to &quot;Tactical Game 3&quot; — retaining royalty rights — to Avalon Hill, who republished the game as &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot;, with professionally designed components and twelve combat scenarios.

From 1970 to 1980, &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; was the top-selling board wargame in North America. Avalon Hill followed &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; with two companion games: &quot;Panzer Leader&quot;, which focused on the Western Front; and &quot;The Arab-Israeli Wars&quot;, which covered the 1956, 1967 and 1973 wars in the Middle East. The numerical values used by counters in &quot;The Arab-Israeli Wars&quot; conformed to the same scales as the World War II sister games, so that players who wanted to create fanciful scenarios involving modern equipment facing World War II equipment could do so while maintaining the internal consistency and realism of the game system.

Multi-Man Publishing acquired the rights to the game, and released &quot;PanzerBlitz: Hill of Death&quot; in 2009.

===Unofficial sequels===
&quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; designer Jim Dunnigan created several &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot;-style games for his own company (which had evolved from Poultron Press to Simulations Publications Inc.): &quot;Combat Command&quot;, &quot;Panzer &#x27;44&quot;, and &quot;MechWar &#x27;77&quot;. However, as critic Heinz von Sieben noted, &quot;The major disappointment with &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; was the sequential nature of the mechanism, and Dunnigan’s mechanism of simultaneous movement for subsequent tactical games such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Desert War&quot; solved one problem, only to introduce a different problem of playability and bookkeeping.&quot;

==Reception==
In Issue 5 of the UK magazine &quot;Games &amp; Puzzles&quot;, (September 1972), game designer Don Turnbull commented, &quot;&quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; is the game which I would isolate as a personal favourite &quot;and&quot; one which is most suitable for a newcomer to the hobby.&quot; Turnbull noted that the game &quot;has variety, flexibility, realism, playability and considerable entertainment value.&quot; After a lengthy examination of the game mechanics, Turnbull concluded, &quot;I recommend &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; highly to anyone aspiring to become a board wargamer. [...] This game probably represents the best combination of the features of board wargaming.&quot; Several issues later, Turnbull added, &quot;At the risk of repeating myself, one of the most flexible and enjoyable games currently available.&quot;

In &quot;A Player&#x27;s Guide to Table Games&quot;, John Jackson noted the &quot;Panzerbush syndrome&quot;, pointing out that &quot;units skulk from woods hex to woods hex, from ravine to protecting slope, without incurring the enemy fire which, in reality, they would have drawn when they exposed themselves on open ground.&quot; However, Jackson concluded, &quot;&quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; is complex; it&#x27;s got a lot of rules and is definitely not the first wargame a novice should tackle. But it&#x27;s challenging and a whole lot of fun, and that&#x27;s what games are all about, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;

In his 1977 book &quot;The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming&quot;, Nicholas Palmer called it &quot;Perhaps the most frequently played wargame ever produced.&quot; He noted &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; was &quot;the first to bring a wealth of tactical detail to the Second World War East Front, and met a delighted reception from the hobby when it came out in 1970.&quot; Palmer highlighted some frailties of the aging game design, particularly &quot;somewhat unbalanced scenarios and the &#x27;Panzerbush&#x27; syndrome, in which units popping from wood to wood cannot be attacked by non-adjacent units, which is a flaw in realism.&quot; He concluded on an upbeat note, saying, &quot;Exciting, high skill level, very complex.&quot;

&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1980&quot;, saying, &quot;Simulating World War Il combat between small units of Germans and Russians, this is the best-selling wargame ever published. Its popular features include a nifty mapboard that fits together in 12 different configurations, and rules that allow players to invent battle situations beyond the 12 provided.&quot;

In the 1980 book &quot;The Complete Book of Wargames&quot;, game designer Jon Freeman called &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; &quot;a watershed design. It was the first to simulate World War II events at the tactical level, the first to treat the differences between armor and infantry as more than a distinction in attack or movement factors, and the first to develop a real sequence of play, with different events occurring at different stages.&quot; He called it &quot;an enormously important game — really the first to break out of the &#x27;classic&#x27; Avalon Hill mode.&quot; In addition to its historical significance in the hobby, Freeman also noted that &quot;It is also a very good game that is fluid in play, exciting, and colorful.&quot; He did admit there were problems with the spotting rules that allowed units &quot;to skulk from woods without being fired on — a pattern known as the &#x27;panzerbush syndrome&#x27;&quot;, as well as with the effectiveness of indirect high explosive artillery. Despite these issues, he gave the game an Overall Evaluation of &quot;Very Good&quot;.

By August 1996, a quarter century after its publication, &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; had sold 275,000 copies. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; columnist Terry Coleman claimed that these figures made it the second-best-selling board wargame ever, behind &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot;. In his 2000 book &quot;Wargames Handbook: How to Play and Design Commercial and Professional Wargames&quot;, &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; designer Jim Dunnigan stated that the game had sold the &quot;extraordinary sales figure&quot; of 320,000 units over 25 years, making it the most successful board wargame in the history of the hobby.

In a retrospective review in Issue 28 of &quot;Simulacrum&quot;, Heinz von Sieben commented, &quot;The abstract simplicity of &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; combined with its elegant physical presentation and its release at a most opportune moment in the growth of interest in board wargames attracted a wide following. Quite simply, &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; was incredibly popular when it first came out, a fact which encouraged the development of other tactical games and ultimately led to the most successful of the tactical systems, &quot;Squad Leader&quot; and &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot;.&quot;

SimCity designer Will Wright cited &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; as one of his influences in designing his later works.

<doc id="1227824" wikidata="Q6545649" url="?curid=1227824" title="Lift jet">
<text>A lift jet is a lightweight jet engine installed only for upward thrust.

An early experimental program using lift engines was the Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig (TMR), nicknamed the &quot;Flying Bedstead&quot;, first run in 1955.

In the early 1960s both the Soviet Union and Western nations considered lift engines to provide STOL or even VTOL capability to combat aircraft. The Soviet Union did concurrent testing of versions of combat aircraft using variable geometry wings or lift jets but ruled out lift jets. Problems associated with lift engines include high fuel consumption, extra weight (which is simply dead weight when the engines are not needed for lift), and taking up fuselage volume that could be used for fuel or other systems. It was decided that variable-geometry wings provided comparable advantages in take-off performance without as many penalties and the Mikoyan MiG-23 and Sukhoi Su-24 entered service.

An operational military aircraft which used lift engines was the Soviet Yakovlev Yak-38, a VTOL fighter used by the AVMF&#x27;s small aircraft carriers, which were not large enough to support conventional fixed-wing aircraft.

An alternative to the lift jet for vertical thrust is the lift fan used on the STOVL Lockheed F-35B version of the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter.

<doc id="1227825" wikidata="Q157744" url="?curid=1227825" title="Communist Party of Indonesia">
<text>The Communist Party of Indonesia (Indonesian: &quot;Partai Komunis Indonesia&quot;, PKI) was a communist party in the Dutch East Indies and later Indonesia. It was the largest non-ruling communist party in the world before its violent disbandment in 1965. The party had two million members in the 1955 elections, with 16 percent of the national vote and almost 30 percent of the vote in East Java. At the time, it was the largest communist party in the world after the Chinese and Soviet communist parties. 

During most of the period immediately following the Indonesian Independence until the eradication of the PKI in 1965, it was a legal party operating openly in the country. Accused of responsibility for the 1965 army-led coup attempt, the party was banned by General Suharto in March 1966.

==History==

===Forerunners===
The Indies Social Democratic Association (Dutch: &quot;Indische Sociaal-Democratische Vereeniging&quot;, ISDV) was founded in 1914 by Dutch socialist Henk Sneevliet and another Indies socialist. The 85-member ISDV was a merger of the two Dutch socialist parties (the SDAP and the Socialist Party of the Netherlands), which would become the Communist Party of the Netherlands with Dutch East Indies leadership. The Dutch members of the ISDV introduced communist ideas to educated Indonesians looking for ways to oppose colonial rule.

The ISDV began a Dutch-language publication, &quot;Het Vrije Woord&quot; (&quot;The Free Word&quot;, edited by Adolf Baars), in October 1915. It did not demand independence when the ISDV was formed. At this point, the association had about 100 members; only three were Indonesians, and it rapidly took a radically anti-capitalist direction. When Sneevliet moved the ISDV&#x27;s headquarters from Surabaya to Semarang, the ISDV began attracting many Indonesians from like-minded movements which had been growing throughout the Dutch Indies since 1900. The ISDV became increasingly incompatible with the SDAP leadership in the Netherlands, who distanced themselves from the association and began to equate them with Volksraad (People&#x27;s Council). A reformist faction of the ISDV broke away and formed the Indies Social Democratic Party in 1917. The ISDV began &quot;Soeara Merdeka&quot; (&quot;The Voice of Freedom&quot;), its first Indonesian-language publication, that year.

Later on, the ISDV saw the events of the October Revolution in Russia as an inspiration for a similar uprising in Indonesia. The organization gained momentum among Dutch settlers in the archipelago. Red Guards were formed, numbering 3,000 within three months. In late 1917, soldiers and sailors at the Surabaya naval base revolted and established soviets. Colonial authorities suppressed the Surabaya soviets and the ISDV, whose Dutch leaders (including Sneevliet) were deported to the Netherlands.

Around the same time, the ISDV and communist sympathizers began infiltrating other political groups in the East Indies in a tactic known as the &quot;block within&quot; strategy. The most apparent effect was the infiltration committed on a nationalist-religious organization Sarekat Islam (Islamic Union) which advocated a pan-islam stance and freedom from colonial rule. Many members including Semaun and Darsono were successfully influenced by radical leftist ideas. As a result, communist thoughts and ISDV agents were successfully planted in the largest Islamic organization in Indonesia. After the involuntary departure of several Dutch cadres, combined with the infiltration operations, the membership shifted from majority-Dutch to majority-Indonesian.

===Establishment===
At its 23 May 1920 congress in Semarang, the ISDV changed its name to Perserikatan Komunis di Hindia (PKH; the Communist Union of the Indies). Semaun became party chairman, and Darsono the vice-chairman. Its highest committee members were predominantly Dutch.

During this time, communist sympathizers were still considered part of Sarekat Islam itself. In the period leading up to the Sarekat Islam&#x27;s sixth congress in 1921, members affiliated with the central branch in Batavia decided to attempt to purge the organization of its communist members. Agus Salim, the organization&#x27;s secretary, introduced a motion banning Sarekat Islam members from dual membership in other parties. The motion passed despite opposition from Tan Malaka and Semaun, forcing the communists to change tactics. The Dutch colonial authorities introduced more restrictions on political activity and Sarekat Islam decided to focus on religious matters, leaving the communists as the only active extremist organization.

In 1922, whilst Semaun was attending Far Eastern Labour Conference in Moscow, Tan Malaka tried to turn a strike by government pawnshop workers into a national strike by all Indonesian labor unions. The plot failed and Malaka was arrested, given a choice between internal or external exile; he chose the latter and left for the Soviet Union. In May, Semaun returned after seven months in the Soviet Union and began to organize the labor unions into a single organization. In September, the Union of Indonesian Labour Organizations (Persatuan Vakbonded Hindia) was formed.

At the Fifth Comintern Congress in 1924, it was emphasized that &quot;the top priority of communist parties is to gain control of trades unions&quot;; there could be no successful revolution without this. The PKH began to concentrate on unions, decided to improve discipline, and demanded the establishment of a Soviet Republic of Indonesia. The party name was changed again that year, to Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI, Communist Party of Indonesia).

===1926 revolt===

====Planning====
In a May 1925 plenary session, the Comintern executive committee ordered the Indonesian communists to form an anti-imperialist coalition with non-communist, nationalist organizations; extremist elements led by Alimin and Musso called for a revolution to overthrow the Dutch colonial government. At a conference in Prambanan, Central Java, communist-controlled trade unions decided that the revolution would start with a strike by railroad workers which would then trigger a general strike; after that, the PKI would replace the colonial government.

The planned revolution would begin in Padang, but a government-security clampdown at the beginning of 1926 which ended the right to assembly and led to the arrest of PKI members forced the party to go deeper underground. Dissention among PKI leaders about the timing and course of the revolution resulted in poor planning. Tan Malaka, the Comintern&#x27;s agent for Southeast Asia and Australia, did not agree with the plot (partly because he believed that the PKI had insufficient mass support). As a result of these divisions, the revolution was postponed in June 1926.

====Revolt====
However, a limited revolt in Batavia (as Jakarta was then known) began on 12 November; similar revolts took place in Padang, Bantam and Surabaya. The Batavia revolt was crushed in a day or two, and the others were quashed in a few weeks.

====Aftermath====
As a result of the failed revolution, 13,000 people were arrested, 4,500 imprisoned, 1,308 interned, and 823 exiled to the Boven-Digoel camp in the Digul region of Western New Guinea; several people died in captivity. Many non-communist political activists were also targeted by colonial authorities under the pretext of suppressing the communist rebellion, and the party was outlawed by the Dutch East Indies government in 1927. The PKI went underground, and Dutch (and, later, Japanese) surveillance ensured that it was never a disciplined or coherent organisation for the remainder of the pre-war period.

During the initial period of illegality, with much of its leadership imprisoned, the PKI kept a somewhat lower profile. Although PKI leader Musso returned from his Moscow exile in 1935 to reorganize the underground (or &quot;illegal&quot;) PKI, his stay in Indonesia was brief, and the leadership of that illegal branch (such as Djokosoedjono) were soon arrested and exiled to Boven-Digoel. Remnants of the party worked on a variety of fronts, such as Gerindo and trade unions. It began working amongst Indonesian students in the Netherlands within the nationalist organization Perhimpunan Indonesia, which the party would soon control.

===Resurgence===

====National revolution====
The PKI re-emerged on the political scene after the 1945 surrender of Japan and actively participated in the Indonesian National Awakening; many armed units were under PKI control or influence. Although PKI militias played an important role in fighting the Dutch, President Sukarno was concerned that the party&#x27;s growing influence would eventually threaten his position. Because the PKI&#x27;s growth troubled the right-wing sectors of Indonesian society and some foreign powers (especially the vigorously anti-communist United States), its relationship with the other forces also fighting for independence was generally difficult.

The PKI and the Socialist Party (Partai Sosialis) formed a joint front, the People&#x27;s Democratic Front, in February 1948. Although the front did not last, the Socialist Party later merged with the PKI; by this time, the Pesindo militias were under PKI control.

====Madiun Affair====
On 11 August 1948, Musso returned to Jakarta after twelve years in the Soviet Union. The PKI politburo was reconstructed, and included D. N. Aidit, M. H. Lukman, and Njoto. After signing the Renville Agreement in 1948, many of the republican armed units returned from zones of conflict; this gave the Indonesian republicans some confidence that they would be able to counter the PKI militarily. Guerrilla units and militias under PKI influence were ordered to disband. In Madiun, a group of PKI military which refused to disarm were countered in September of that year; the confrontations sparked a violent uprising, which provided a pretext to clamp down on the PKI. It was claimed by army sources that the PKI had announced the proclamation of a Soviet Republic of Indonesia on 18 September, with Musso as president and Amir Sjarifuddin as prime minister. At the same time, however, the PKI had denounced the uprising and appealed for calm. The uprising was suppressed by republican troops, and the party experienced another period of repression. On 30 September, Madiun was taken over by republican troops of the Siliwangi Division. Thousands of party members were killed, and 36,000 were imprisoned. Amongst the executed were several leaders, including Musso (who was killed on 31 October, allegedly while trying to escape from prison). Although Aidit and Lukman went into exile in China, the PKI was not banned and continued to function; its reconstruction began in 1949.

====Publishing====
During the 1950s, the party began publishing again; its main publications were &quot;Harian Rakyat&quot; and &quot;Bintang Merah&quot;, as well as quarterly journal &quot;PKI dan Perwakilan&quot;.

===Leadership of D. N. Aidit===

====National Unity Front====
In January 1951, during the meeting of the Central Committee, D. N. Aidit was chosen General Secretary. Under Aidit, the PKI grew rapidly—from 3,000–5,000 in 1950 to 165,000 in 1954 and 1.5 million in 1959. The PKI led a series of militant strikes in August 1951 which were followed by clamp-downs in Medan and Jakarta, and the party leadership briefly went underground.

====Consultative Body of Political Parties====
Also under Aidit, the PKI began to consider the possibility of cooperation with the Indonesian National Party (PNI) to overthrow the Masyumi-led cabinet of Mohammad Natsir.

===1955 legislative election===

The PKI favoured Sukarno&#x27;s plans for Guided Democracy before the 1955 election, and actively supported him.

The party finished fourth in the election, with 16 percent of the vote and nearly two million members. It won 39 seats (out of 257), and 80 out of 514 in the Constituent Assembly. Almost 30 percent of the votes in East Java were cast for the PKI.

===Struggle against capitalism===
Opposition to continued Dutch control of Irian Jaya was often raised by the party during the decade, and the PKI office in Jakarta experienced a grenade attack in July 1957. The party made advances in municipal elections that month, and in September the Islamist Masyumi Party demanded that the PKI be banned.

On 3 December, trade unions largely under PKI control began seizing Dutch-owned companies. These seizures paved the way for the nationalization of foreign-owned businesses. The struggle against foreign capitalism gave the PKI an opportunity to profile itself as a national party.

By the mid 1950s, the PKI had a reputation of being one of the least corrupt parties in Indonesia. Officials in the US were becoming concerned that it might be difficult to defeat the PKI in elections, as they were well organized and spoke to the needs of the people. Said Richard Nixon, vice president at the time: &quot;a democratic government was [probably] not the best kind for Indonesia.&quot;

===PRRI rebellion===
A coup attempt was made by pro-US forces in the military and the political right wing in February 1958. The rebels, based in Sumatra and Sulawesi, proclaimed a Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (Pemerintah Revolusioner Republik Indonesia) on 15 February. The revolutionary government immediately began arresting thousands of PKI members in areas under their control, and the party supported Sukarno&#x27;s efforts to quell the rebellion (including the introduction of martial law). The rebellion was eventually defeated.

===Nasakom===
In August 1959, there was an attempt on behalf of the military to prevent the PKI&#x27;s party congress. The congress was held as scheduled, however, and was addressed by Sukarno. In 1960, Sukarno introduced &quot;Nasakom&quot;: an abbreviation of (nationalism), (religion) and (communism). The PKI&#x27;s role as a junior partner in the Sukarno policy was institutionalized; the PKI welcomed Nasakom, seeing it as a multi-class united front.

===Guided democracy===
Although the PKI supported Sukarno, it retained its political autonomy; in March 1960, the party denounced the president&#x27;s undemocratic handling of the budget. On 8 July of that year, &quot;Harian Rakyat&quot; carried an article critical of the government. The PKI leadership was arrested by the army, but was later released in accordance with Sukarno&#x27;s orders. When an independent Malaysia was conceived, it was rejected by the PKI and the Malayan Communist Party.

With growing popular support and a membership of about three million by 1965, the PKI was the strongest communist party outside China and the republics of the Soviet Union. The party had a firm base in mass organizations such as the Central All-Indonesian Workers Organization (Sentral Organisasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia), People&#x27;s Youth (Pemuda Rakjat), the Indonesian Women&#x27;s Movement (Gerakan Wanita Indonesia), the Peasants Front of Indonesia (Barisan Tani Indonesia), the Institute of People&#x27;s Culture (Lembaga Kebudajaan Rakjat) and the Association of Indonesian Scholars (Himpunan Sardjana Indonesia). At its peak, the total membership of the party and its front organizations was claimed to be one-fifth of the Indonesian population.

In March 1962, the PKI joined the government; party leaders Aidit and Njoto were appointed advisory ministers. The following month, the PKI held its party congress. In 1963, the governments of Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines discussed territorial disputes and the possibility of a Maphilindo confederation (an idea introduced by Philippine president Diosdado Macapagal. The PKI rejected Maphilindo; party militants entered Malaysian Borneo, fighting the British, Malaysian, Australian, and New Zealand forces there. Although some groups reached the Malay Peninsula, planning to join the struggle there, most were captured on arrival. Most PKI combat units were active in the border regions of Borneo.

In January 1964, the PKI began confiscating British property owned by British companies in Indonesia. During the mid-1960s, the United States Department of State estimated party membership at about two million (3.8 percent of Indonesia&#x27;s working-age population).

Sukarno&#x27;s balancing act with the PKI, the military, nationalist factions, and Islamic groups was threatened by the party&#x27;s rise. The growing influence of the PKI concerned the United States and other anti-communist Western powers. The political and economic situation had become more volatile; annual inflation reached over 600 percent, and living conditions for Indonesians worsened.

In December 1964, Chairul Saleh of the Murba Party (formed by former PKI leader Tan Malaka) claimed that the PKI was preparing a coup. The PKI demanded a ban on the Murba Party, which was imposed by Sukarno in early 1965. In the context of &quot;Konfrontasi&quot; with Malaysia, the PKI called for arming the people. Large sectors of the army were opposed to this, and Sukarno remained officially noncommittal. In July, about 2,000 PKI members began military training near Halim Air Force Base; the concept of arming the people had won support among the Air Force and the Navy. On 8 September, PKI demonstrators began a two-day siege of the U.S. consulate in Surabaya. Aidit addressed a PKI rally on 14 September, urging members to be alert for things to come. On 30 September, Pemuda Rakyat and Gerwani (both PKI-associated organizations) held a mass rally in Jakarta to protest the inflation crisis.

===30 September Movement===
During the night of 30 September and 1 October 1965, six of Indonesia&#x27;s top army generals were killed and their bodies thrown down a well. The generals&#x27; killers announced the following morning that a new Revolutionary Council had seized power, calling themselves the &quot;30 September Movement&quot; (&quot;G30S&quot;). With much of the army&#x27;s top leadership dead or missing, General Suharto took control of the army and put down the abortive coup by 2 October. The army quickly blamed the coup attempt on the PKI, and began an Indonesia-wide anti-Communist propaganda campaign. Evidence linking the PKI to the generals&#x27; assassinations is inconclusive, leading to speculation that their involvement was very limited or that Suharto organised the events (in whole or in part) and scapegoated the communists. In the ensuing violent anti-communist purge, an estimated 500,000 communists (real and suspected) were killed and the PKI effectively eliminated. General Suharto outmaneuvered Sukarno politically and was appointed president in 1968, consolidating his influence on the military and government.

On 2 October, the Halim base was recaptured by the army. Although &quot;Harian Rakyat&quot; carried an article in support of the G30S coup, the official PKI line at the time was that the attempted coup was an internal affair within the armed forces. On 6 October, Sukarno&#x27;s cabinet held its first meeting since 30 September; the PKI minister Njoto was in attendance. A resolution denouncing G30S was passed, and Njoto was arrested immediately after the meeting.

A mass demonstration was held in Jakarta two days later demanding a ban on the PKI, and the party&#x27;s main office was burned down. On 13 October, Ansor Youth Movement (the youth wing of Nahdlatul Ulama) held anti-PKI rallies across Java. Five days later, Ansor killed about a hundred PKI members.

===Mass killings===
Between 100,000 and two million Indonesians were killed in the mass killings that followed. The victims included non-Communists who were slain because of mistaken identity or guilt by association. Although a lack of information makes it impossible to pinpoint an exact casualty figure, many scholars today suggest that the figure is at least 500,000. According to a CIA study of the events in Indonesia, &quot;In terms of the numbers killed the anti-PKI massacres in Indonesia rank as one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century&quot;.

The United States played a significant role in the killings, supplying economic, technical and military aid to the Indonesian military when the killings began and providing &quot;kill lists&quot; (via the U.S. embassy in Jakarta) with the names of thousands of suspected high-ranking members of the PKI. A tribunal held in the Hague in 2016 concluded the massacres were crimes against humanity, and the U.S. backed the Indonesian military &quot;knowing well that they were embarked upon a programme of mass killings&quot;. Declassified U.S. diplomatic cables released in 2017 corroborate this. According to UCLA historian Geoffrey B. Robinson, the Indonesian army&#x27;s campaign of mass killings would not have occurred without the support of the US and other powerful Western governments. Documentary filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer, director of &quot;The Act of Killing&quot; and &quot;The Look of Silence&quot;, said:

We know that U.S. embassy officials were compiling lists of thousands of names of public figures in Indonesia and handing these to the army and saying, &#x27;Kill everybody on these lists and check off the names as you go, and give the lists back to us when you’re done&#x27;.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine presented the following account on 17 December 1965:

Communists, red sympathizers and their families are being massacred by the thousands. Backlands army units are reported to have executed thousands of communists after interrogation in remote jails. Armed with wide-bladed knives called parangs, Moslem bands crept at night into the homes of communists, killing entire families and burying their bodies in shallow graves.

The murder campaign became so brazen in parts of rural East Java, that Moslem bands placed the heads of victims on poles and paraded them through villages. The killings have been on such a scale that the disposal of the corpses has created a serious sanitation problem in East Java and Northern Sumatra where the humid air bears the reek of decaying flesh. Travelers from those areas tell of small rivers and streams that have been literally clogged with bodies.

Although the motive for the killings seemed political, some scholars argue that the events were caused by panic and political uncertainty. Part of the anti-Communist force responsible for the massacres consisted of members of the criminal underworld who were given permission to engage in acts of violence.

Among the worst-affected areas was the island of Bali, where the PKI had grown rapidly before the crackdown. Approximately 80,000 people - 5% of the island&#x27;s population - are estimated to have been killed. As in Java, it was the military that incited and organized the killings, despite since-discredited claims that the military actually had to restrain local people. 

On 22 November, Aidit was captured and summarily executed by the army. The military announced that Aceh had been cleared of communists in December, and special military courts were set up to try jailed PKI members. The party was banned by Suharto on 12 March, and the pro-PKI Central All-Indonesian Workers Organization was banned in April. Some of the events were fictionalized in the 1982 film, &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot;.

==After 1965==
After initial sporadic resistance, the PKI was paralyzed after the 1965–1966 killings. The party&#x27;s leadership was crippled at all levels, leaving many of its former supporters and sympathizers disillusioned, leaderless and disorganized. The remnants of the party politburo issued a September 1966 statement of self-criticism, criticizing the party&#x27;s previous cooperation with the Sukarno regime. After Aidit and Njoto were killed, Sudisman (the fourth-ranking PKI leader before October 1963) took over the party&#x27;s leadership. He attempted to rebuild the party on a base of interlocking groups of three members but made little progress before he was captured in December 1966 and sentenced to death in 1967.

Some PKI members took refuge in an isolated region south of Blitar in East Java after the crackdown on the party. Among the leaders in Blitar were the Politburo member Rewang, the party theorist Oloan Hutapea and the East Java leader Ruslan Widjajasastra. Blitar was an underdeveloped area where the PKI had strong peasant support, and the military was unaware that the PKI had consolidated there. The PKI leaders were joined by Lieutenant Colonel Pratomo, the former commander of the Pandeglang military district in West Java, who helped provide military training for the local communists. Violence erupted in Blitar in March 1968, as local peasants attacked leaders and members of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) in retaliation for the role it had played in anti-communist persecution; about 60 NU members were killed. According to Australian political scientist Harold Crouch, it was unlikely that the killings of NU members in Blitar had been ordered by the PKI leaders. The military became aware of the PKI enclave and crushed it by mid-1968.

Some party members were outside Indonesia at the time of the 30 September events; a sizeable delegation had traveled to the People&#x27;s Republic of China to participate in the anniversary celebration of the Chinese Revolution. Others had left Indonesia to study in Eastern Europe, particularly Albania. Although the party apparatus continued to function in exile, it was largely isolated from political developments in Indonesia. In Java, some villages that were known refuges for members (or suspected sympathizers) were identified by authorities and closely watched for a long time.

, former PKI members remained blacklisted from many occupations (including government jobs). During his presidency, Abdurrahman Wahid invited PKI exiles to return to Indonesia in 1999 and proposed the removal of restrictions on the open discussion of communist ideology. In arguing for the removal of the ban, Wahid cited Indonesia&#x27;s original 1945 constitution (which did not prohibit, or specifically mention, communism). Wahid&#x27;s proposal was vigorously opposed by some sectors of Indonesian society, especially conservative Islamic groups. In an April 2000 protest, the Indonesian Islamic Front rallied ten thousand people in Jakarta against Wahid&#x27;s proposal. The army did not immediately reject the proposal, promising a &quot;comprehensive and meticulous study&quot; of the idea.

<text>The Hong Kong flu, also known as the 1968 flu pandemic, was an influenza pandemic that occurred between 1968 and 1970 and which killed between one and four million people globally. It is among the deadliest pandemics in history, and was caused by an H3N2 strain of the influenza A virus. The virus was descended from H2N2 (which caused the Asian flu pandemic in 1957–1958) through antigenic shift, a genetic process in which genes from multiple subtypes are reassorted to form a new virus.

==History==

=== Origin and outbreak in Hong Kong and China ===
The first recorded instance of the outbreak appeared on 13 July 1968 in British Hong Kong. It has been speculated that the outbreak began in mainland China before it spread to Hong Kong: On 11 July, before the outbreak in the colony was first noted, the Hong Kong newspaper &quot;Ming Pao&quot; reported an outbreak of respiratory illness in Guangdong Province, and the next day, &quot;The Times&quot; issued a similar report of an epidemic in southeastern China. Later reporting suggested that the flu had spread from the central provinces of Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, which had experienced epidemics in the spring. However, due to a lack of etiological information on the outbreak and a strained relationship between Chinese health authorities and those in other countries at the time, it cannot be ascertained whether the Hong Kong virus was to blame.

The outbreak in Hong Kong reached its maximum intensity in two weeks. The outbreak lasted around six weeks, affecting about 15% of the population (some 500,000 people infected), but the mortality rate was low and the clinical symptoms were mild.

There were two waves of the flu in mainland China, one between July and September in 1968 and the other between June and December in 1970. The reported data were very limited due to the Cultural Revolution, but retrospective analysis of flu activity between 1968 and 1992 shows that flu infection was the most serious in 1968, implying that most areas in China were affected at the time.

=== International spread ===
Despite the lethality of the 1957–1958 pandemic in China, little improvement had been made regarding the handling of such epidemics.

By 13 August, it was clear to virologists that strains isolated from the outbreak in Hong Kong differed markedly from previous strains of influenza. However, they were not at the time considered to be an entirely new subtype of influenza A, only a variant of older strains. Nevertheless, the World Health Organization warned of potential worldwide spread of the virus on 16 August. An outbreak of influenza-like illness in Singapore during the second week of August was the first indication of spread outside of Hong Kong. Around the same time, an outbreak became apparent in the Philippines and Malaysia, and, before the end of the month, an epidemic was underway in the Republic of Vietnam.

In September 1968, the flu reached India, northern Australia, Thailand, and Europe. The same month, the virus entered the United States and was carried by troops returning from the Vietnam War, but it did not become widespread in the country until December 1968.

In the USSR, the first cases of the flu began to appear in mid-December.

It reached South America by 1969.

The development of the pandemic at first resembled that of the 1957 pandemic, which had spread unencumbered throughout the spring and summer and had become truly worldwide by October, by which point nearly all countries were experiencing their first or even second wave. However, the two experiences eventually diverged within a couple of months after their initial outbreaks. In 1968, many countries (e.g., the United Kingdom, Japan) did not immediately see outbreaks despite repeated introductions of the virus throughout August and September. Additionally, after September, there was little evidence of continued spread in new areas, despite similar importations of the virus into those areas. Epidemics did eventually develop during the winter months, but these were often mild (especially when compared to the experience in the United States). In some countries (such as the UK and Japan), it was not until the following winter of 1969–1970 that truly severe epidemics developed.

At the time of the outbreak, the Hong Kong flu was also known as the &quot;Mao flu&quot; or &quot;Mao Tse-tung flu&quot;. The name &quot;Hong Kong flu&quot; was not used within the colony, where the press dubbed it the &quot;killer flu&quot; after the first several deaths. Before the end of July, the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; predicted that &quot;Fingers of scorn&quot; would be directed at Hong Kong in the coming weeks and stated that the colony had &quot;acted, unwillingly, in our old role as an entrepot for a sneeze&quot;. (An outbreak of influenza in Hong Kong had been the first one to occur outside of mainland China during the 1957–1958 pandemic and had been what alerted the rest of the world to the developing situation, when international press began to report on it.)

Denny Huang, a member of the Urban Council of Hong Kong, later decried the widespread adoption of the name &quot;Hong Kong flu&quot;, claiming that it was &quot;giving Hong Kong a bad name&quot;. He asked why foreign press and health authorities did not refer to it by its &quot;proper name—China flu&quot;. China certainly did not escape associations with the new virus, however, as the name &quot;Mao flu&quot; suggests. It was speculated even at the time that the virus had originated from &quot;Red China&quot;. These differing names for the flu resulted in some confusion: In January 1969, a British member of parliament asked David Ennals, the Secretary of State for Social Services, &quot;in what way the characteristics of Mao flu can be distinguished from those of Hong Kong flu&quot;. In addition to these names, the virus was also often referred to as &quot;Asian flu&quot; or &quot;Asiatic flu&quot;, as it was not yet considered an entirely different subtype from the previously circulating influenza A.

Worldwide deaths from the virus peaked in December 1968 and January 1969, when public health warnings and virus descriptions had been widely issued in the scientific and medical journals. Isolated countries like Albania reported the first cases of the flu in December 1969, reaching a peak in infections in the first months of the year 1970. In Berlin, the excessive number of deaths led to corpses being stored in subway tunnels, and in West Germany, garbage collectors had to bury the dead because of a lack of undertakers. In total, East and West Germany registered 60,000 estimated deaths. In some areas of France, half of the workforce was bedridden, and manufacturing suffered large disruptions because of absenteeism. The UK postal and rail services were also severely disrupted.

==== Asia ====

===== India =====
On 8 September 1968, the ship &quot;S.S. Rajula&quot; docked at Madras (present-day Chennai) from Singapore, where influenza had been epidemic the month before. On board were 16 persons with suspected influenza infections, a number of which were confirmed to be caused by the pandemic virus. On 9 September, only eight cases of typical influenza were reported in city hospitals, but by 17 September the number had reached 7661, after which incidence of the disease declined to just 68 cases on 31 October.

The epidemic thereafter spread throughout Madras State. Pandemic influenza was reported in Chengalpattu, Kanchipuram, Pondicherry, Vellore, Coimbatore, and the Nilgiris district during the second half of September; in Madurai, Tiruppur, Karur, Tiruchirappalli, Thanjavur, and Palani during the first half of October; and in Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram, and Salem during the middle and second half of October. The epidemic then declined in the latter part of November and December.

Although the epidemic in Madras State seemed to originate from Madras upon the arrival of &quot;S.S. Rajula&quot;, two strains of the pandemic virus were in fact isolated at the end of August elsewhere, namely Coonoor and Ooty, suggesting that the virus had likely already been seeded prior to its apparent importation from Singapore on 8 September.

Concurrent with the outbreak in Madras State was a moderate epidemic in Bombay (present-day Mumbai), which began the second week of September and subsided in October.

There was a recurrence of influenza in December 1969, when a &quot;considerable increase&quot; in the disease was reported in several states.

===== Iran =====
During the second week of September, nearly 2000 participants from 92 countries, including some in southeast Asia where the flu was epidemic, met in Tehran for the Eighth International Congresses on Tropical Medicine and Malaria. An outbreak of influenza soon erupted among the participants, afflicting at least a third of them. The convention was the apparent origin of a broader outbreak within the capital city, which thereafter spread rapidly throughout Iran.

===== Japan =====
The virus entered Japan repeatedly throughout August and September via importations from Hong Kong and other countries already afflicted, but these introductions did not spark any larger outbreak. The first &quot;true epidemic&quot; began in early October, confined almost entirely to school settings. It was not until January 1969 that the outbreak began to develop the typical features of an epidemic among the general population, although it remained moderate in its extent and spread less rapidly than expected for an outbreak of a novel influenza virus. The epidemic was reported to be still increasing on 6 February, spreading from the larger cities into the smaller cities, towns, and villages, though the rural areas were relatively less affected. By 13 March, the epidemic had mostly subsided within the large cities.

During this same period, an epidemic of influenza B affected the whole country, including rural parts. For this reason, it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which the pandemic virus and the seasonal B virus each contributed to the general wave of influenza-like illness that occurred between January and February 1969.

A second pandemic wave developed in Japan towards the end of November 1969 and subsided in January 1970. This outbreak was more localized within the east of the middle part of the country, around Tokyo. Like that in many countries of Europe, the second wave in Japan was more severe than the first. While the 1968–1969 wave saw excess pneumonia and influenza and all-cause mortality rates of 5.4 and 27.0 per 100,000, respectively, the 1969–1970 wave saw rates of 11.3 and 49.1 per 100,000, respectively. In sum, approximately two thirds of the total pandemic mortality occurred over the winter of 1969–1970.

==== Oceania ====

===== Australia =====
The pandemic reached Australia in September 1968, resulting in a severe epidemic among the general population of the Northern Territory; however, no further outbreaks were reported elsewhere until the following year. Generally mild outbreaks began to be reported in mid-May 1969. In Melbourne, influenza broke out in the suburbs in mid-June, developing into an epidemic that peaked about 20 July and had subsided by mid-August. In Sydney, the disease broke out at the beginning of July and continued into August. Another epidemic, more widespread and severe than the first, afflicted the Northern Territory in 1969.

Australia experienced another pandemic wave in 1970, reportedly more widespread than that of 1969. Queensland saw a widespread epidemic of high incidence between 1 June and early July. Between 10 June and mid-August, a widespread epidemic, also of high incidence, affected New South Wales, particularly Sydney. A moderate outbreak driven by the pandemic virus alongside other respiratory viruses affected Victoria between mid-June and August, followed by a secondary outbreak, involving some influenza B, that subsided in mid-September. For the third year in a row, the Northern Territory experienced an epidemic of the pandemic virus, though the disease was less severe than in 1968 and 1969.

Similar to Japan and countries in Europe, Australia in general experienced a more severe second wave of the pandemic as compared with the first. While the first wave of 1969 produced excess pneumonia and influenza and all-cause mortality rates of 4.0 and 23.5 per 100,000, respectively, the second wave resulted in excess mortality rates of 14.1 and 63.8 per 100,000, respectively.

===== Territory of Papua and New Guinea =====
In 1968, the Territory of Papua and New Guinea became aware of the possibility of an influenza epidemic after the first appearance of the virus in Australia late in the year, but no such epidemic ultimately occurred. As the disease spread throughout the Pacific region and around the world, the Territory&#x27;s Department of Health took the opportunity to observe the situation in other countries and ensure treatment services were available to respond to outbreaks in rural areas.

The disease first appeared in the Territory in late May 1969 but resulted in only a small outbreak within coastal centers. Although the outbreak subsided in June, flu cases continued to build up, with 252 reported in July and 407 in August.

In August, the South Pacific Games were held in Port Moresby from the 13th to the 23th and later the Mount Hagen Show was held in the Western Highlands on the 30th and 31st. These two events, the latter seeing an attendance of nearly 100,000 people, were likely significant in spreading the disease and reigniting the outbreak. On 29 August, pandemic influenza was reported as &quot;raging&quot; in Lae (on New Guinea itself), in Rabaul (on the island of New Britain), and on Bougainville Island. However, the disease was described as mild, with its main symptom being a &quot;very sore&quot; throat. No deaths had thus far been reported.

By mid-September, a &quot;big&quot; influenza epidemic had developed throughout the Western Highlands. At Mount Hagen, the site of the show the month before, nearly one third of its population was reportedly down with the disease. Though flu victims crowded into Mt Hagen Hospital, a number suffering complications from the disease, it took another several weeks before the severity of the epidemic was recognized.

The epidemic raged practically unabated throughout the Highlands, where the disease &quot;spread like wildfire&quot;. Later reporting would reveal that most of the 200,000 people living in the Southern Highlands had contracted the flu in late September and early October. At the time, however, the first indication of the seriousness of the outbreak came on 6 October, when the latest field report revealed that over 150 people had died across the Territory during the month of September, 96 in the Southern Highlands alone, with many in remote villages having already been buried. Despite Health Department fears that the true toll could be as high as 300, mass vaccination at this point was considered a pointless exercise, as only the healthy would be immunized. Moreover, field patrols reported that the epidemic was now being brought under control and was &quot;petering out&quot; in the Western and Southern Highlands, and health officials felt confident that the disease would not reach the isolated Sepik and Western Districts.

By 13 October, the death toll had risen to &quot;at least&quot; 235, though unconfirmed reports out of Goroka indicated that the toll had already reached 500 in the Southern Highlands. By the next day, the toll had climbed to 403, 207 in the Southern Highlands, and now health authorities could see no end to the epidemic in the near future. It had reached the Eastern Highlands and Morobe Districts, and it was now expected to reach not only Madang but Sepik as well later in the month. Patrols were on the move into all villages in the Highlands, and extra supplies and personnel were being directed to aid stations in areas of most need.

In a reversal from previous statements, it was announced that 10,000 doses of flu vaccine would now be sent to the Territory, in order to protect those in remote areas that had not yet been affected. With the mounting number of deaths, especially in the Highlands, and the extent of the epidemic across the Territory now clear, the Health Department had contacted the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories to discuss the situation. CSL would send the doses to the Territory as a gift, enough for about 24 hours, and further supplies would come at a later point.

Another 56 deaths were reported from the Highlands on 15 October, bringing the toll to 459. By the next morning, the number had reached 462, and before the end of the day, it was 526. Field reports indicated that the epidemic had already reached the Sepik District, and deaths were reported from the Madang and East Sepik Districts for the first time. It was now clear that not many areas would not remain unaffected. In response to this unexpected severity, it was announced that the Health Department had intensified its efforts to combat the epidemic. These new measures involved alerting and resupplying all aid posts via personal visit, doubling staff at aid posts where the disease was occurring, and continually visiting aid posts over the next several weeks.

On 17 October, it was announced that the Australian Army would be providing Territory health authorities with five helicopters to help in the fight against the disease. The helicopters, previously on survey work, would now be at the complete disposal of the Health Department. Another 100,000 doses of vaccine were also on the way, with the Highlands being the priority. William D. Symes, the first assistant director of health, explained that native people in all the Highland areas not yet affected would be vaccinated, while those in the coastal areas, apparently of greater resistance to the virus, would not. In addition, the Administration on this day informed the Indonesian authorities in West Irian of the epidemic and the actions currently being taken to combat it.

Health authorities, with the help of the Army and its helicopters, spent the weekend distributing and administering vaccine. No new deaths were reported, though Roy Scragg, Director of Public Health, acknowledged reports of further but as of yet unconfirmed deaths. More deaths indeed were soon to be officially reported.

On the morning of 21 October, widespread reports indicated that the death toll from the epidemic had surpassed 1,000, though no confirmation came from the Administration. In the afternoon, it came to be known that the Department of Information and Extension Services would be releasing a statement on flu deaths, but upon being contacted, the Department claimed the information was not available. This was, apparently, because the Department of External Territories first had to approve the release of the information. Territory Administrator David Hay had no comment when asked about this confusion. At last, sometime after 6:30 pm, the updated death toll of 1,455 was released to the public.

This sudden increase in deaths over the week before was not necessarily due to an increase in the severity of the epidemic but rather because reports had finally come in from patrols moving through remote areas, and for the same reason, the death toll was expected to rise again. Still, it was evident that the outbreak was one of the worst to affect the Territory in recent years, now affecting all 18 districts, and it was worsening still in the Southern Highlands, where 600 had died in just three weeks. The Ministerial Member for Public Health, Tore Lokoloko, reported that about 25% of all deaths in that area were of young adults, an unprecedented occurrence in a Territory flu epidemic. In light of these developments, the Administration called for outside aid for the first time. A Royal Australian Air Force aircraft was now on the way to deliver an army hospital to assist medical authorities in their efforts to combat the epidemic.

On 22 October, it was reported that the epidemic would likely cost more than $250,000 in vaccine supplies and drugs alone, while the cost of helicopters and other means to contact people in the immunization campaign was not yet known. By this point, about 160,000 doses of vaccine had been sent to the Territory, and emergency vaccination of 200,000 people would soon begin in the unaffected areas of the Central, Morobe, Madang, Eastern Highlands, and Southern Highlands Districts.

On 23 October, Hay announced that field officers had been asked for urgent reports on any emergency aid needed to fight the epidemic in the Highlands. Hay further announced the establishment of a five-man Epidemic Relief Committee to determine the relief measures required by affected families and to direct aid where needed. The committee, headed by Lokoloko, would in addition consist of Ian Skinner, Director of Civil Defence; Dr. Alan Tarutia, a specialist in preventive medicine; P. Donaldson, an Administration representative; and H. Stubbs, the president of the Territory Red Cross. The committee would begin an inspection tour of the areas hardest hit by the epidemic the following day.

On 24 October, health authorities announced that another 208 deaths had been reported the day before, bringing the total number of deaths to 1,663. Scragg clarified that these deaths had all occurred prior to 20 October but had only just been reported following the return of patrols from remote areas; many were from areas not previously included in the death toll.

In Lae, Dr. C. Matthews, Medical Superintendent of Angau Memorial Hospital, announced that no special precautions would be taken during the upcoming Morobe Show, to be held from Friday the 24th to Sunday the 26th. He explained that all possible precautions had already been taken to immunize people in the villages and that to set up a vaccination program at the show &quot;would be merely doubling up&quot;. The alternative, to cancel the show altogether, was considered earlier in the week but was ultimately decided to be unnecessary.

On Monday, health authorities reported another 208 deaths, bringing the death toll now to 1,871; as before, all deaths had occurred before 20 October. Scragg later explained that doctors were trying to distinguish between deaths from before the 20th and those from after, as many of the 1,871 thus far reported had actually occurred up to five or six months before. The next day, it was reported that tests were in process at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories to determine if a new virus could be responsible for the severity of the epidemic in the Highlands, in particular the disproportionate number of deaths among young adults in the area, similar to what had originally happened in Hong Kong the year before, when the pandemic virus was first detected.

After the report of the first case of influenza in the Tari area of the Southern Highlands on 24 October, Administration officials and staff worked to seal off mountain passes between the area and infected parts on the other side. A few days later, it was announced that a center to investigate the best way to treat flu-related complications would be established at Tari, in particular the effectiveness of a long-acting penicillin as compared with normal treatments. As part of the study, 1,500 people would be injected with the long-acting penicillin while another 1,500 would receive penicillin only after complications had developed, as is typically done. If the new penicillin proved effective, medical staff would only need to administer the drug once during an epidemic rather than have to return to villages constantly.

Lokoloko and the rest of the Epidemic Relief Committee returned to Port Moresby on 29 October following their inspection tour of the Highlands. They reported that some areas of the Highlands were experiencing a severe food shortage, in particular around Pangia, at the eastern end of the Southern Highlands. While adults there typically consumed nearly 11 lbs of kaukau (sweet potato) per day, some were now subsisting on as little as 6 oz per day, and a few had not eaten anything for several days. In response the committee arranged for 10 tons of rice and two tons of fish to be sent to the area at once, and shipments of the same amounts would continue periodically until new gardens began producing food. In addition, it was reported that requests for blankets and other warm clothing had come in from many areas. Hay approved the program to send the needed supplies to affected areas the following day.

On 30 October, the Director of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, William R. Lane, announced that tests performed on virus samples isolated from the epidemic showed that the strain responsible was in fact the Hong Kong flu and not a novel virus. Scragg expressed his relief at this news, as that was the type for which medical officers had been treating the people of the Territory.

The next day, Scragg announced that the epidemic death toll had reached 1,980 but that the worst now appeared to be over. Of the new deaths reported, 42 had occurred since 20 October, across Morobe, Madang, and the Southern Highlands. He reported that the situation in the Southern Highlands was now under control. On 3 November, it was reported that the Army units that had been helping in the fight against the epidemic were beginning to move out, though some would remain and be moved around mostly to assist in vaccination rather than treating the sick.

On 7 November, Scragg reported a further 33 deaths due to the epidemic since 20 October, bringing the death toll to 2,013. In total, only 75 deaths had been reported since that date, and Scragg stated that the death rate due to pneumonia and influenza appeared to have returned to normal levels in the affected areas. The disease was still occurring in some small pockets, but few deaths were being reported. Dr. A. L. Malcolm, the Regional Medical Director at Lae, reported that the epidemic appeared to have paused and that officers were now waiting to see how it would continue.

No further deaths were reported over the weekend, it was announced on 10 November. Now, senior Health Department and Army officials were moving into the field to visit affected areas and to decide when the Army could pull out and the Department could effectively take control of the epidemic response. On 11 November, the Army continued its pullout from the Highlands, with most Army medics set to move out on the 15th. However, some forces would remain in West Sepik and other areas of Sepik for the time being. In response to these developments, Scragg stated that this withdrawal of the Army was a definite indication that the epidemic was on the decline and that the Administration was now able to handle it on its own.

On 13 November, Lokoloko addressed the House of Assembly regarding the influenza epidemic. He described the outbreak in the Southern Highlands as &quot;a major disaster&quot; and explained the necessity of the assistance from the armed forces. He further recounted how the Health Department had prepared for the epidemic and why vaccination had been advised against at first but then later recommended. He explained health officers&#x27; view on why the Southern Highlands had suffered so severely in comparison with other areas. In short, this was due to the low temperatures of the Highland plateaus, malnutrition, the people not seeking medical attention when it could have been provided, and widespread sickness that incapacitated whole families at the same time. He reported that about 2,000 had died in September and October out of the one million people living in the Highlands, though it was not possible to know for sure how many had died from the epidemic. He described the experience of one area where the number of deaths reported was twice the number that had actually occurred in September and October, and some deaths were in fact from up to two years before. Nonetheless, he asserted that despite these issues in reporting, the number of deaths due to pneumonia and influenza was undoubtedly at least twice the number to occur normally over the same period.

On 17 November, Lokoloko spoke further regarding the epidemic. In response to fellow House member Matiabe Yuwe of Tari, Lokoloko reported that Administration spending on the campaign to fight the epidemic had totaled $400,000 but that total spending was not known. He attributed this figure to the involvement of the Army, the Air Force, and other Administration Departments.

On 27 November, it was announced that Pope Paul VI had donated $5,000 for victims of the epidemic. Archbishop Virgil Patrick Copas, who received the letter about the donation, expressed his intent to get in touch with the Administration and churches (&quot;not just Catholic&quot;) in areas that have been most affected.

On 18 December, Reuben Taureka, Highlands Regional Medical Officer, announced in Goroka that the influenza epidemic in the Highlands had concluded. At a meeting of the Southern Highlands District Advisory Council on 6 January 1970, Fr. Berard Tomasetti of Pureni moved a vote of thanks to those who had helped in the fight against the epidemic in the Highlands.

==== Europe ====

===== France =====
Pandemic influenza was first noted in France in the latter half of January 1969, with sporadic cases appearing in the district of Paris. It thereafter spread throughout the rest of the country, though incidence of the disease remained low and moderate in extent. In many areas only sporadic cases were noted, although there were some localized outbreaks reported in towns and villages. The outbreak reached its peak in March, began to decline in April, and subsided in May.

The disease was generally mild or moderate in severity. Although some months saw greater mortality than the corresponding periods of 1967 and 1968, the total number of reported deaths due to influenza during the first 4 months of 1969 was only 3186, as compared with 3472 and 7267 in 1967 and 1968, respectively. Excess pneumonia and influenza and all-cause mortality rates in 1968–1969 were 6.2 and 21.8 per 100,000, respectively, as opposed to 16.6 and 58.9 per 100,000, respectively, in 1967–1968.

Influenza reappeared in France about mid-November 1969, originating in the southwest. It then spread throughout the entire country, peaked around the new year, and subsided in the second half of January. In contrast to the previous winter, the incidence of disease during the second wave was high, although the disease itself remained mild or moderate in its presentation. Nonetheless, as in other European countries, the second wave resulted in greater mortality in France as compared with the first, with excess pneumonia and influenza and all-cause mortality rates of 35.3 and 71.5 per 100,000, respectively. Death rates were generally greater in the southwest of the country and lower in the north.

===== Italy =====
Pandemic influenza was not detected in Italy until the last week of February 1969, from a case in Genova. The country saw only sporadic cases of respiratory illness in the winter of 1968–1969, and there was ultimately no epidemic that first pandemic season.

The disease began to spread with force in late November 1969, around the time that the Apollo 12 crew returned to Earth; for this reason, some Italians humorously designated the outbreak &quot;the moon flu&quot;. By 9 December, a &quot;fairly large epidemic&quot; had spread throughout the country, afflicting an estimated 15 million persons, with an estimated 1.5 million cases, or about half its population, in Rome alone, including Prime Minister Mariano Rumor. Upwards of 20 to 25 million Italians were reported to be infected by the end of the year, around which time the national epidemic reached its peak. The disease subsided in February 1970.

Like other European countries, Italy experienced a more severe outbreak in the second pandemic season than in the first. In fact, Italy seems to have been affected even more severely during the winter of 1969–1970 as compared with other European countries during the same period, with excess mortality rates approximately 1-fold higher than those elsewhere in the region. Ultimately an estimated 20,000 Italians died due to pneumonia and influenza and an estimated 57,000 died from all causes in excess of the expected numbers during the winter of 1969–1970.

===== Netherlands =====
An epidemic among the general population of the Netherlands began on 22 December 1968 and was reported as decreasing as of 15 February 1969. Health officials estimated the attack rate during the epidemic to have been about 30%, though influenza B was also prevalent at the time. The disease was generally mild; however, it resulted in excess mortality nearly equal to that during the epidemic of 1967–1968. Unlike that epidemic, however, younger age groups were more vulnerable to infection, and the age distribution of deaths was about the same as in 1957.

Another widespread epidemic occurred the following year, beginning during the second half of December 1969, peaking during the week of 4–10 January 1970, and subsiding during the second week of February. Incidence of the disease was high, and the case fatality rate was higher than usual. This pandemic experience was unlike that in many other European countries, where the first wave was relatively mild or hardly occurred at all while the second wave was considerably more widespread and severe.

===== Poland =====
The first cases of pandemic influenza occurred in Poland in December 1968, though it was not until mid-January 1969 that an outbreak of very high morbidity began among the general population, in contrast to most other European countries during the winter of 1968–1969. By late February, the epidemic was on the decline. In total an estimated 3–4 million cases of influenza-like illness occurred during the first wave in Poland, with nearly 500,000 in Warsaw alone.

Beginning in early January 1970, a second nationwide epidemic occurred in Poland. The disease was reported to be generally mild, although there were some complications, at times fatal; such complications occurred more frequently than during the typical influenza season.

===== Spain =====
Up to 5 March 1969, there was no epidemic among the general population of Spain, nor were there any reports to the World Health Organization of sporadic cases, localized outbreaks, or virus isolations. During the last week of February 1969, however, the pandemic virus did appear in Barcelona, with an outbreak soon following. It peaked in late March and subsided at the beginning of May. The epidemic began in the city and thereafter spread to towns, villages, and rural areas, ultimately affecting the whole province. The disease was on the whole mild, with a very low death rate.

Spain was the first country to report the recurrence of the pandemic in Europe. The disease broke out again in early October 1969, evidently first in Madrid and later in the northern parts of the country, in particular Lugo and Navarre. The epidemic peaked during the month of November and was over by 27 December. On the whole, the disease was again generally mild, though pneumonia was a more frequent complication than usual.

===== United Kingdom =====
The pandemic virus was first isolated in early August 1968 from a 23-month-old child in London with no known contact with any recent arrivals from the Far East. Isolated cases continued throughout the autumn, with a few localized outbreaks but no extensive spread in the general population. The first community outbreaks were reported towards the end of the year and became more frequent in January and February 1969.

The course of the epidemic in Great Britain can be tracked by looking at sickness benefit claims and consultation rates for clinically diagnosed influenza-like illness. The number of new claims increased sharply the first week of 1969 but only reached just over 300,000 in a single week, as compared with the peak of 485,000 seen during the 1967–1968 epidemic of H2N2. New claims increased again in early February and continued until mid-April but only reached 352,000. As for consultation rates for influenza-like illness, the rate peaked at 420 per 100,000 at the end of February 1969, but, similar to the sickness benefit claims, was far below the comparable figure for the previous year, which was 514 per 100,000.

Northern Ireland experienced a moderate outbreak of pandemic influenza in February and March 1969, but morbidity and mortality were both considerably lower than during the last major epidemic in the winter of 1965–1966. On the whole, the first wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom was unusually long, lasting over three months, and resulted in no significant demands upon general medical practitioners or hospital services.

Speculation of a recurrence the following autumn began almost as soon as the first outbreak had subsided in the spring. The virus indeed reappeared in October 1969 on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland, and in November 1969 in Southern England, without evidence of local spread. Soon thereafter, however, in early December, sickness benefit claims began to rise sharply. In Birmingham, hospital admissions were restricted to emergency cases in December due to so many sick doctors and nurses. On 16 December, hospitals in London went on a yellow alert, stopping all but urgent admissions; on 27 December, the alert shifted to red, with only the most urgent flu cases being given beds. By the end of the year, emergency flu cases in the city had reached their highest level in seven years.

The epidemic interfered with English football, requiring several matches to be postponed. Three League matches set to be held on 20 December and three set for 3 January 1970 were called off due to sickness on the teams, while four FA Cup matches set for 3 January also had to be delayed.

Sickness benefit claims peaked at nearly 750,000 the first week of 1970, exceeding the peak of the 1957 pandemic. Consultation rates for influenza-like illness behaved similarly, peaking at 1,260 per 100,000 the last week of 1969 and the first week of 1970. Ultimately the wave subsided quickly, after just about six weeks, and was over by the end of January.

In general, the United Kingdom saw a more severe second wave of the pandemic as compared with the first, as in other European countries, Japan, and Australia. The number of weekly deaths due to influenza, pneumonia, and bronchitis in Great Britain remained relatively low during the winter of 1968–1969, peaking at 2,550 as compared with over 5,300 the winter before. Excess deaths due to influenza stood at 1,000 and those due to influenza, bronchitis, and pneumonia reached 12,000, while all-cause excess mortality was 31,000. In contrast, during the winter of 1969–1970, deaths due to influenza, bronchitis, and pneumonia increased dramatically, peaking at over 10,500. Excess deaths due to influenza were 10,000 and those due to influenza, bronchitis, and pneumonia were 32,000, while all-cause excess mortality was 47,000.

==== North America ====

===== Canada =====
Canada experienced an epidemic among the general population that began in December 1968 and was reported as decreasing on 14 February 1969. It was, on the whole, &quot;much less severe&quot; than the concurrent epidemic in the United States. This relative moderateness was attributed at the time to the recent epidemic of 1967–1968 as well as the happenstance of timing, as the increase in cases was interrupted by the holiday period.

Between mid-January and mid-March 1970, there was an increased incidence and localized outbreaks of pandemic influenza in all regions except the north, though incidence remained generally low. There was, however, an epidemic in all of Newfoundland Province. Later, between the third week of March and April, there was an outbreak of influenza A in Coral Harbour in the Northwest Territories, though the exact subtype was not specified.

On the whole the two waves were more balanced in Canada, with the first only slightly more severe than the second, which could be explained by the more heterogeneous local activity in Canada as compared with the United States, whose first wave was significantly more severe than its second.

===== Guatemala =====
A rise in influenza-like illness was reported in Guatemala in the early weeks of 1969, reaching a peak during the week ending 22 March before declining. Due to a lack of laboratory facilities, the exact cause could not be identified, but the disease was considered to represent pandemic influenza.

Cases increased again in late July 1969. After a brief decrease, cases again increased until the week ending 4 October, when they then declined. Serology tests at this time indicated pandemic influenza. However, some cases of illness diagnosed in late July and early August might actually have been Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), which was at that time epidemic and epizootic. The later increase was very likely due to influenza, however.

===== Mexico =====
Mexico reported its first major attack of pandemic influenza in the winter of 1969–1970, in Mexico City, where 35–40% of the population was affected. It began in the second half of November 1969, peaked in December, and then subsided in January 1970. Some other areas were also affected, though incidence was more moderate. The disease was reported to be moderately severe, with more deaths than expected in the elderly, children, and other adult age groups.

===== Panama =====
Isolated cases of pandemic influenza were reported in October 1968 in the Panama Canal Zone, at this time a concession of the United States. An epidemic among the general population of the Canal Zone began 8 June 1970, peaking 1 July and subsiding that same month. There was a high incidence of disease, with bacterial complications reported. An epidemic among the general population of Panama as a whole began around the same time, in June 1970.

===== Puerto Rico =====
An epidemic among the general population of Puerto Rico was first recognized on 7 September 1968. Several small outbreaks were later reported in November 1969, but incidence remained low.

===== United States =====
After a major epidemic of H2N2 during the 1967–1968 flu season that resulted in outbreaks in all but four states, the National Communicable Disease Center (today the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in June 1968 forecasted little or no activity in the United States during 1968–1969. The vaccines for the upcoming season would incorporate the then-circulating seasonal flu strains, and the CDC&#x27;s recommendations for their use extended mainly to individuals in older age groups (over the age of 45) and the chronically ill.

Following the outbreak in Hong Kong and the recognition that it had been caused by a new variant of influenza, the CDC on 4 September revised its prediction for the 1968–1969 season. An extensive outbreak across the country was now more likely. It repeated more strongly its recommendation that existing vaccines go only to those at highest risk and recommended vaccinating or revaccinating this group once the monovalent vaccine specific to the new variant became available.

The first cases of the virus were reported in Atlanta on 2 September. The first was a Marine Corps major returning from Vietnam, who fell ill four days after arriving back in the US. Two days later, his wife, who had not left the country, fell ill as well. The first outbreak occurred in a Marine Corps school in San Diego that same week. Before the end of the week, influenza surveillance was heightened all across the country, and summaries of the data were thereafter reported regularly by the CDC each week in its &quot;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&quot;. Further outbreaks among military personnel with connections to southeast Asia were soon to follow during the middle of September.

Isolated cases, mostly in those recently returning from the Far East, seeded the virus across the country throughout September. The first outbreaks in the civilian population occurred in late September and in October, and activity increased markedly throughout November, affecting 21 states by Thanksgiving.

The epidemic became widespread in December, involving all 50 states before the end of the year. Outbreaks occurred in colleges and hospitals, in some places the disease attacking upwards of 40% of their populations. Reports of absenteeism among students and nurses grew. Schools in Los Angeles, for example, reported rates ranging from 10% to 25%, compared to a typical 5% or 6%. The Greater New York Hospital Association reported absenteeism of 15–20% among staff and urged its members to impose visitor restrictions to safeguard patients.

Institutions in many states dismissed their students early for the holidays. In New York and many other areas, holiday sales suffered mid-December, which affected retailers blamed on the flu epidemic (though inflation could have contributed to this as well). Economic activity was also hampered by high levels of industrial absenteeism.

On 18 December, it was reported that President Johnson had been hospitalized at Bethesda Naval Hospital with flu-like symptoms, but whether the new variant was the cause of his illness was not made clear. He returned to the White House on 22 December. Vice President Humphrey was also reported to be ailing from the flu on the day Johnson&#x27;s condition was revealed. Flu-like illness kept other senior governmental officials from their posts around this time, such as National Security Advisor Walt Rostow, Deputy White House Press Secretary Tom Johnson, and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Earle Wheeler. On 23 December, it was reported that President-elect Nixon had been ill with the flu at his daughter&#x27;s wedding the day before. Nixon later claimed that &quot;the wedding cured the flu.&quot;

Peak influenza activity for most states most likely occurred in the latter half of December or early January, but the exact week was impossible to determine due to the holiday season. Activity declined throughout January. Excess pneumonia-influenza mortality passed the epidemic threshold during the first week of December and increased rapidly over the next month, peaking in the first half of January. It took until late March for mortality to return to normal levels. There was no second wave during this season.

Following the epidemic of influenza A, outbreaks of influenza B began in late January and continued until late March. Mostly elementary-school children were affected. This influenza B activity fit within the pattern of epidemics every three to six years, but the 1968–1969 flu season became the first documented instance of two major influenza A epidemics to occur in successive seasons.

Given the widespread epidemic levels of influenza A activity in 1968–1969, the CDC in June 1969 predicted little more than &quot;sporadic cases&quot; of influenza A in the 1969–1970 season. Influenza activity was indeed less than the preceding season, but there was &quot;considerably more&quot; than expected. The flu affected 48 states the following season but was widespread in only six, compared to 44 out of the 50 states in which activity was reported in 1968–1969.

In October 1969, the CDC, alongside Emory University, collaborated with the WHO to host an international conference on the novel influenza in Atlanta. A wide range of topics was discussed, including the origin and path of the pandemic, the experiences of individual countries, and effective control measures, such as vaccination.

==== South America ====

===== Argentina =====
Isolated cases of pandemic influenza were reported in Argentina in December 1968, though no large-scale outbreak occurred until mid-May 1969. The country experienced a widespread epidemic that year that lasted about 18 weeks and consisted of two waves, the first caused by the pandemic virus and the second caused by influenza B.

A widespread epidemic of high incidence and severe disease affected Córdoba beginning 10 July 1970, after a first outbreak in June. It peaked 8 August and subsided 10 September. In Buenos Aires, an epidemic of moderate incidence began at the end of June and subsided in July.

===== Chile =====
Chile experienced a severe outbreak, mainly in Santiago and the central provinces, beginning in late May. It peaked during the week of 20–27 July, with deaths nearly double those of June, and declined during August. Influenza was observed clinically in the southern provinces in August and September. Overall the outbreak was not as severe as in 1957.

There was a slight increase in influenza between July and August 1970 in Santiago and its suburbs, but incidence remained low.

===== Venezuela =====
Venezuela reported isolated cases of pandemic influenza on 4 January 1969, though no outbreak was reported until later that year, when incidence began to increase in December 1969, particularly in Caracas, before subsiding in February 1970. Overall, incidence remained low to moderate.

==== Africa ====
The incidence of the first wave of the pandemic varied considerably across the African continent. Different studies used different methods to determine influenza activity (paired serology, single serology, influenza-like illness), so these data may not be directly comparable.

Pandemic influenza was first reported in West Africa: The Gambia saw a peak between November 1968 and March 1969, while Senegal saw increased activity between July and September 1969. North Africa potentially saw a peak in December 1968, based on data from Egypt. In East Africa, activity increased in Sudan from February 1969 through June 1969, while Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda saw an increase from April 1969 to August 1969. Finally, epidemic activity in South Africa began about mid-March 1969 and peaked between May and June.

East Africa experienced a second wave approximately coincident with that in the northern hemisphere, lasting from October 1969 to February 1970 in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, while activity lasted into June 1970 in Sudan. In North Africa, data from Algeria suggest activity began to rise in November 1969, and data from Egypt suggest the peak occurred in January 1970. In West Africa, the Gambia did not see activity until between March and November 1970.

In general, pandemic activity in North, West, and East Africa in 1968 and 1969 lagged behind that observed in Europe, while in South Africa, it preceded activity in Australia by one month.

The available data suggest that the 1968 pandemic, in particular its second wave, may have had a significant impact on the public health of African populations, despite the general characterization of the pandemic as having been mild compared to 1918 or 1957.

=== Vaccine ===
It became apparent once the extent of antigenic variation in the virus was recognized that a new vaccine would be needed to protect against it. However, production of the previously recommended vaccines in the US had concluded by July 1968, and supply of fertilized chicken eggs, in which flu vaccines are grown, was limited. The first cultures of the virus were provided to manufacturers in August by the Division of Biologics of the National Institutes of Health for preliminary study. A strain isolated in Japan was sent to the US and, after showing greater potential for vaccine production, was given to manufacturers on 9 September.

In 1968, American microbiologist Maurice Hilleman was head of the virus and vaccination research programs at the pharmaceutical firm Merck &amp; Co., one of the licensed vaccine manufacturers in the US. Hilleman, as the director of the Department of Respiratory Diseases at the Army Medical School (now the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research), had foreseen the 1957 pandemic and kickstarted vaccine production then. He was similarly instrumental in the development of the 1968 pandemic vaccine and, with the use of the Japanese strain, helped initiate early production. Merck would go on to produce over 9 million of the nearly 21 million doses of vaccine produced. The other half was produced together by Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Lederle Laboratories, Parke Davis &amp; Co., the National Drug Company, and Wyeth Laboratories. All of these except Wyeth had been involved in the production of the 1957 vaccine.

On 15 November, 66 days after the production strain became available, the first batch of 110,000 doses of vaccine was released, most of which went to the Armed Forces. This represented a quicker turnaround than the release of the first doses of the 1957 vaccine, which took three months after its production strain became available. At this time, the flu was spreading fast around the country. There was much interest within the press and among public figures in the vaccine. On 18 November, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association announced that 17.5 million doses would be available for civilian use but said that &quot;substantial quantities&quot; would only come after the New Year. By the end of the year, over 10 million doses had been released. At this point, influenza was widespread in the country.

Notably, the crew of Apollo 8 received the vaccine on 3 December prior to their mission later in the month. President Johnson received &quot;two types&quot; of vaccine prior to his bout of flu in December, but it is not clear if one of these was the pandemic vaccine. Johnson, 60 at the time, was in poor health and had been hospitalized several times during his presidency. He thus would have been prioritized for vaccine given the CDC recommendations, even outside of being the president.

Lots of vaccine continued to be released throughout January 1969, with nearly 21 million doses available by the end of the month. By this point, however, influenza activity and subsequent mortality had already peaked. Demand for the vaccine diminished and a considerable surplus remained. Given the time it took to build up antibodies, it is unlikely a significant number of people were effectively immunized to alter the course of the epidemic. Hilleman himself would later acknowledge that the vaccine was &quot;too little and too late&quot; for most of the country. However, it was estimated that a &quot;considerably higher&quot; proportion of the recommended priority group of older and chronically ill persons received the pandemic vaccine than in 1957. Nevertheless, even after the foul-up associated with the vaccination effort in 1957, US health officials by 1968 still had &quot;no meaningful information regarding [influenza vaccine&#x27;s] actual distribution&quot;, such as &quot;to what extent it actually reaches persons at highest risk.&quot;

Following the epidemic in the US, leftover vaccine was made available for the southern hemisphere and parts of Europe where the main outbreak had not yet happened. The Japanese strain of the new variant was incorporated into the bivalent vaccines recommended for the 1969–1970 flu season in the US.

Outside the US, vaccination efforts were undertaken in many countries in anticipation of an epidemic. In contrast to US policy, Japan had, since 1963, carried out mass vaccination campaigns against influenza every year regardless of whether an epidemic was expected. This began with the immunization of all children in kindergartens and primary and secondary schools followed by the vaccination of those working in crowded conditions. Enough vaccine was produced each year to vaccinate about 24 million people (nearly a quarter of Japan&#x27;s population at this time), and this became the goal in 1968, targeting the same priority groups as in a typical flu season.

The same Japanese strain used for vaccine production in the US was immediately sent out to the seven manufacturing firms in Japan. It was soon decided a bivalent vaccine consisting of two parts the new variant and one part influenza B would be produced, in contrast to the US&#x27;s use of monovalent vaccine. The objective was also set that enough vaccine to immunize about 12 million people would be produced by the end of October, with the hope of at least vaccinating children to guard against an epidemic developing out of schools. After some delay, the mass vaccination campaign was nearly completed before the end of the year.

Yugoslavia received the Japanese strain in mid-October and immediately began experimental trials prior to large-scale production. During this time before the new vaccine was ready, 1.5 million doses of seasonal influenza A vaccine were distributed for use. Ten million doses of the pandemic vaccine had been produced by mid-January 1969, and nearly 1 million people were immunized before the end of February. About 100,000 doses were designated for the mass immunization of schoolchildren.

In Denmark, the influenza department at the governmental Statens Serum Institut produced about 200,000 doses of pandemic vaccine during the winter of 1968–1969, incorporating a strain isolated in Stockholm. There were no particular difficulties in production, but yield was poor.

Millions of doses of vaccine were available in South Africa before its epidemic began at the end of March 1969, which afforded the opportunity to perform &quot;limited studies&quot; of its effectiveness.

By January 1969, vaccine production in Australia was underway at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL), then a department of the federal government. The trivalent pandemic vaccine, composed of two influenza A strains and a B strain, was anticipated for release in early March ahead of the winter flu season. The inoculation consisted of a two-dose series, each given four weeks apart.

CSL was aggressive in its promotion of the vaccine, at least to doctors. A spokesman for the laboratories described the new virus as &quot;the worst flu we have had&quot; and called an epidemic that year &quot;almost certain&quot;. In light of the situation, the Australian Pensioners Federation in early January wrote to Minister for Health Jim Forbes &quot;demanding&quot; that the vaccine be given free of charge to pensioners. In contrast to CSL&#x27;s bolder predictions, Forbes described an outbreak that winter as &quot;possible&quot; but did not think it would &quot;necessarily be serious or extensive&quot;. While the Department of Health reviewed the question of pandemic vaccine allocation in Australia, the government exported 1 million doses of its vaccine to Britain, already at the peak of its epidemic.

In early February, the epidemiology committee of Australia&#x27;s National Health and Medical Research Council met in Melbourne to discuss the influenza threat and the best use of vaccine the coming winter. A &quot;serious epidemic&quot; was considered the &quot;strongest possibility&quot;, and it was recommended to Forbes that older people, children, and pregnant women receive free immunization against the flu. However, the council advised against a mass vaccination campaign, citing the findings of its study which showed the unreliable protection against infection of the present vaccines, and considered it unwise to vaccinate healthy people while the limited supply could be better used to mitigate severe outcomes in at-risk groups.

On the last day of February, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee met to consider the question of making the pandemic vaccine a pharmaceutical benefit for pensioners. Before the end of the week, Forbes announced that shots would be given for free to all pensioners and their dependents, representing about two-thirds of the three groups recommended for priority immunization. The policy would go into effect starting 1 April.

Vaccination against the flu was recommended beginning 1 March, but issues surrounding availability of vaccine soon became apparent throughout the month. In response to Representative Gordon Scholes of Victoria, who had heard complaints from chemists unable to acquire vaccine, Forbes clarified that bulk orders from larger establishments would be met first. He relayed the expectation of the director of CSL that the present situation would be met once quantities of single doses became available in early April.

In the middle of March, Forbes assured that all medical practitioners would be able to acquire the vaccine by the middle of April. He described the new type of flu as milder than that which Australia had typically seen each year.

Representative Charles Jones of Newcastle later in the month questioned Forbes why his home city&#x27;s order had not been filled. Forbes revealed the export of 1 million doses to Britain earlier in the year but assured that the order &quot;did not delay, or in any way hinder, [the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories&#x27;] capacity to fill Australian orders&quot; and that there would be enough supply to meet expected demand. By this time, 1,755,000 doses had been released, and production continued its pace of 200,000 doses per week.

Despite these assurances from Forbes, the Director General of the Department of Health William Refshauge sent a letter on 9 April to all doctors in the country asking them not to vaccinate healthy people until at-risk groups in the community have been inoculated. Forbes reported meeting with the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories commission to discuss how to speed up distribution of vaccine. Two days later, the director of CSL, William R. Lane, dismissed criticism of the supply situation from the New South Wales branch of the Australian Medical Association as &quot;a lot of nonsense&quot;. Contradicting the laboratories&#x27; more forceful marketing earlier in the year, he downplayed the likelihood of a serious epidemic but shared the expectation of 4 million doses distributed by the end of May, eight times as much as the average annual total distribution of 500,000 vaccine doses.

On 22 April, Forbes testified in the House of Representatives regarding the vaccine situation. He reported 2.5 million doses had been produced by this time since February. When asked by Representative Theo Nicholls of South Australia to consider importing vaccine to alleviate the present shortage, Forbes noted that the country had already imported the 150,000 doses available. He lamented CSL&#x27;s recent subjection to a &quot;good deal of abuse&quot; regarding the &quot;temporary shortages&quot; around the country, repeating the comparison between the present production effort and the country&#x27;s average annual distribution of only 500,000 doses. That same day, N. F. Keith, president of the Victorian branch of the Pharmacy Guild, called on CSL to explain the situation surrounding vaccine supply to the public, which was putting pressure on chemists due to the lack of vaccines.

On 25 April, it was reported that the Department of Health had reimported the remaining vaccine from the order of 1 million that the government had exported to Britain in January. After being sent to Britain, packaged there, and then sent back to Australia, it was sold to doctors at a markup of nearly 50 percent. Doctors criticized the Department and CSL&#x27;s poor planning with respect to vaccine supply and the decision to export vaccine to Britain when it had already reached the peak of its flu season. They also blamed the shortage on an overreaction by the public, a response which they considered largely due to public statements made by CSL and health officials. The Department later attributed the decision to reimport the vaccine to a desire to ensure a reliable supply for pensioners. It also denied any involvement in the commercial sales of vaccine, in response to reporting on price markups on the reimported vaccine, saying that all it did was authorize the reimportation and list the product as a pharmaceutical benefit. The government itself was paying the same for the reimported vaccine as it was for that being distributed by CSL.

By the end of April, 2.8 million doses of vaccine had been produced and distributed, with no signs of production slowing down. 250,000 doses were now being produced each week, and nearly half a million more were anticipated for 2 May.

A vaccination program was carried out in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea during the epidemic in 1969, though it came about only after the severity of the outbreak became clear.

On 6 October, the latest field reports on the epidemic came in and revealed a death toll of over 150 people, 96 in the Southern Highlands alone. At this stage, however, it was the position of the Territory&#x27;s Department of Health that there was &quot;no point in any large scale immunisation program&quot;. This initial position was based on several factors: the 1969 epidemic in Australia had been relatively mild, immunity acquired by vaccination was of doubtful value and short-lived, the virus itself changed regularly and thus the value of any vaccine could not be known, and influenza vaccine did not prevent illness and most who received it would still get sick. In short, health officials did not expect to see mortality at the level at which it ended up occurring. As more deaths began to be reported, however, a reevaluation of the effectiveness of the vaccine was made in Australia, and reports indicated that it had proved effective in parts there. The Department, accordingly, shifted its position on mass vaccination.

In light of the evolving situation, the Health Department contacted the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne, and the two parties &quot;discussed the situation generally&quot;. During this conversation, the suggestion of sending 10,000 doses of vaccine to the Territory was raised. CSL agreed to ship the first supply as a gift, enough for about 24 hours, with further shipments to come later. Charles Barnes, the Minister for External Territories in Australia&#x27;s House of Representatives, announced this development on 14 October, and CSL commented the following day that the vaccine could save some lives.

On 16 October, the first 10,000 doses arrived in the Territory, with another 100,000 doses coming in the next day. With the help of the Australian Army, health officials began flying the supplies into remote Highland areas. Over the next few days, mass immunizations began, with Army helicopters transporting about 20,000 doses each into the Western, Southern, and Eastern Highlands Districts as well as the Chimbu and Madang Districts; nearly 70,000 doses were sent to Tari, in the Southern Highlands, alone, which had not yet been affected by the epidemic.

By 22 October, 160,000 doses had been sent to the Territory. Ultimately, $308,000 worth of influenza vaccine and other medical supplies were purchased and distributed within 3 weeks. In total, some 340,000 doses of vaccine were given, but its effectiveness in controlling the outbreak was, in the end, not clearly demonstrated. Following this campaign, it was decided that mass vaccination would not be undertaken again in 1970.

=== Post-pandemic ===
The H3N2 virus ultimately displaced the previously circulating H2N2 virus, which first emerged in 1957.

Following the recurrences of 1969–1970, there was a relatively low incidence of influenza the subsequent two global flu seasons, from October 1970 to September 1971. Influenza B was predominant in the north, causing extensive outbreaks in the United States, but minimal in the south. The Hong Kong virus, on the other hand, was responsible for some large outbreaks in the Southern Hemisphere, some most likely occurring in populations that had still not been exposed to the virus.

It was during this period that the city of Coonoor, in India, experienced a &quot;fairly extensive&quot; outbreak, in July 1971. Samples of the virus responsible were collected but their significance was not immediately recognized. The virus did not immediately spread to other countries, or at least did not immediately cause outbreaks, but it was amid an epidemic in England in early 1972, fueled by more original strains, that a variant showing considerable antigenic drift was identified in one isolate tested out of over 700. It ultimately came to be designated A/England/42/72. It was soon recognized, by comparison with the strains isolated then, that this virus had been the one responsible for the epidemic in India.

The novel variant did not immediately spread after that outbreak, and circulating strains largely continued to resemble quite closely the original Hong Kong virus through April 1972. In May, however, at the onset of the flu season in the Southern Hemisphere, epidemics caused by the variant struck Malaysia, Singapore, and Australia, though South Africa and South America were unaffected. The die seemingly cast, the novel variant went on to cause widespread outbreaks in the Northern Hemisphere, by which point US press had dubbed the bug &quot;London flu&quot;. It completely replaced the previous strains still resembling the original pandemic virus. In places such as the US and England and Wales, the 1972–1973 flu season was the deadliest since their respective deadliest waves of the pandemic between 1968 and 1970.

Influenza A/H3N2 remains in circulation today as a strain of seasonal flu.

==Clinical data==
Flu symptoms typically lasted four to five days, but some cases persisted for up to two weeks.

==Virology==

The Hong Kong flu was the first known outbreak of the H3N2 strain, but there is serologic evidence of H3N1 infections in the late 19th century. The virus was isolated in Queen Mary Hospital.

Soon after the initial outbreak in Hong Kong, the virus responsible was recognized to be antigenically distinct from the current influenza A strain in circulation (which at the time was called &quot;A2&quot;) but was generally not considered an entirely new subtype. Analysis using the conventional techniques at the time revealed that it was indeed very different from older A2 viruses but also, at the same time, seemingly related to them, depending on one&#x27;s reading of the data. Experiments involving newer methods of analysis soon identified another surface antigen, neuraminidase, in addition to hemagglutinin, which had already been recognized. It thus became clear that it was the hemagglutinin that had changed compared to older strains while the neuraminidase was identical. These findings, in part, prompted the World Health Organization in 1971 to revise its system of nomenclature for influenza viruses, taking into consideration both antigens. The novel virus was thereafter designated H3N2, indicating its partial similarity to H2N2 but also its antigenic distinction.

The H3N2 pandemic flu strain contained genes from a low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus. Specifically, it had acquired a new hemagglutinin gene and a new PB1 gene, while it preserved the neuraminidase and five other genes from the preexisting human H2N2 strain. The new hemagglutinin helped H3N2 evade preexisting immunity in humans. It is possible that the new PB1 facilitated viral replication and human-to-human transmission.

The new subtype arose in pigs coinfected with avian and human viruses and was soon transferred to humans. Swine were considered the original &quot;intermediate host&quot; for influenza because they supported reassortment of divergent subtypes. However, other hosts appear capable of similar coinfection (such as many poultry species), and direct transmission of avian viruses to humans is possible. H1N1, associated with the 1918 flu pandemic, may have been transmitted directly from birds to humans.

Accumulated antibodies to the neuraminidase or internal proteins may have resulted in many fewer casualties than most other pandemics. However, cross-immunity within and between subtypes of influenza is poorly understood.

The basic reproduction number of the flu in this period was estimated at 1.80.

==Mortality==
The estimates of the total death toll due to Hong Kong flu (from its beginning in July 1968 until the outbreak faded during the winter of 1969–70) vary:
* The World Health Organization and &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot; estimated the number of deaths due to Hong Kong flu to be between 1 and 4 million globally.
* The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, in total, the virus caused the deaths of 1 million people worldwide.

However, the death rate from the Hong Kong flu was lower than most other 20th-century pandemics. The World Health Organization estimated the case fatality rate of Hong Kong flu to be lower than 0.2%. The disease was allowed to spread through the population without restrictions on economic activity, and a vaccine created by American microbiologist Maurice Hilleman and his team became available four months after it had started. Fewer people died during this pandemic than in previous pandemics for several reasons:

# Some immunity against the N2 flu virus may have been retained in populations struck by the Asian Flu strains that had been circulating since 1957.
# The pandemic did not gain momentum until near the winter school holidays in the Northern Hemisphere, thus limiting the infection&#x27;s spread.
# Improved medical care gave vital support to the very ill.
# The availability of antibiotics that were more effective against secondary bacterial infections.

=== By region ===
For this pandemic, there were two geographically distinct mortality patterns. In North America (the United States and Canada), the first pandemic season (1968–1969) was more severe than the second (1969–1970). In the &quot;smoldering&quot; pattern seen in Europe and Asia (United Kingdom, France, Japan, and Australia), the second pandemic season was two to five times more severe than the first. In the United States an estimated 28,100 to 56,300 people died over the winter of 1968–1969; most excess deaths were in those aged 65 and older.

<text>Illinois Route 394 (IL 394), also known as the Calumet Expressway, is a four-lane state highway that travels north from a junction with IL 1 south of Crete to an interchange in South Holland with Interstate 294/Interstate 94/Interstate 80 (I-294/I-94/I-80, Tri-State Tollway/Bishop Ford Freeway; this route is an extension of, but not part of the latter freeway). Although not an Interstate Highway, Illinois 394 is an Interstate-standard highway from its junction with Sauk Trail at Sauk Village to its northern terminus at the I-294/I-94/I-80 interchange in South Holland. IL 394 functions as a bypass of IL 1 to the west, of which it was formerly part, and provides access to southern suburbs of Chicago.

==Route description==

IL 394 begins as a four-lane arterial at a junction with IL 1 south of Crete, continuing as through traffic from IL 1 north. The highway curves to the east before assuming a north–south alignment, running parallel to IL 1 to the east, heading north as a surface street arterial, before becoming an Interstate-standard freeway at an intersection with Sauk Trail in Sauk Village. Shortly thereafter, the freeway meets U.S. Highway 30 (US 30, Lincoln Highway) in Ford Heights. Continuing northward, IL 394 ends at an interchange with I-294/I-94/I-80 (Tri-State Tollway/Bishop Ford Freeway) interchange in South Holland.

==History==
Before taking the IL 394 designation, the route was a former alignment of IL 1. In the 1950s, a freeway, then known as the Calumet Expressway, was constructed south of Chicago as an extension of Doty Avenue. There were traffic lights at the intersections of Doty with 111th, 115th, and 130th, but interchanges were built in the early 1960s. The expressway was originally designated as IL 1, Alternate US 30, and certain portions as US 6 and IL 83. By 1964, IL 1 was restored to its old alignment along Halsted Street, and US 6 and IL 83 were routed onto Torrence Avenue, while the IL 394 designation was applied to the expressway south of the portion designated as I-94. At this time, IL 1 was discontinued north of I-57. In 1962, the connection between the Calumet Expressway and Dan Ryan Expressway opened and is now signed as part of the Bishop Ford. In 1996, the Calumet Expressway was renamed in honor of Bishop Louis Henry Ford, the leader of the Church of God in Christ who had died the previous year.

In 2006 and 2007, IL 394 was reconstructed north of Glenwood–Dyer Road as part of the massive Kingery Expressway reconstruction effort. The intersection with I-80, I-94 and I-294 was improved. In the southbound direction, the ramps were rebuilt, with a gentler left-exit curve for I-94 to travel from the Bishop Ford to the Kingery Expressway. The cloverleaf-style ramps to southbound IL 394 were replaced with a flyover and the distributor leg of a collector–distributor ramp from eastbound I-80/I-294. In the northbound direction, a dangerous ramp to eastbound I-80/I-94 was replaced with a ramp to a set of collector–distributor lanes, intended for US 6 and IL 83 (Torrence Avenue). A cloverleaf ramp from eastbound I-80/I-294 was replaced with a flyover, and the merge area where IL 394 terminates was improved. (The I-94 ramp itself has been moved nearly a mile [1.6 km] east to before Torrence Avenue). These improvements were completed in June 2007.

<text>Inman Park is an intown neighborhood on the east side of Atlanta, Georgia, and its first planned suburb. It was named for Samuel M. Inman.

==History==
Today&#x27;s neighborhood of Inman Park includes areas that were originally designated:
* Inman Park proper (today the Inman Park Historic District)
* Moreland Park (today the Inman Park-Moreland Historic District)
* part of Copenhill Park (properties on Atlantis, the south side of Highland, and the north sides of Sinclair and a block of Austin)
* former industrial areas on the western side, now mixed-use developments including Inman Park Village and North Highland Steel

The area was part of the battlefield in the Battle of Atlanta in 1864.

===Atlanta&#x27;s first streetcar suburb===
Inman Park (proper) was planned in the late 1880s by Joel Hurt, a civil engineer and real-estate developer who intended to create a rural oasis connected to the city by the first of Atlanta&#x27;s electric streetcar lines, along Edgewood Avenue. The East Atlanta Land Company acquired and developed more than 130 acres east of the city and Hurt named the new suburb for his friend and business associate, Samuel M. Inman. Joseph Forsyth Johnson was hired as landscape designer for Inman Park who included curvilinear street designs and liberal usage of open spaces in his planning.

The &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; in 1896 grandly described Inman Park:

High up above the city, where the purest breezes and the brightest sunshine drove away the germs of disease, and where nature had lavished her best gifts, the gentlemen who conceived the thought of Inman Park found the locality above all others which they desired. It was to be a place of homes, of pretty homes, green lawns, and desirable inhabitants. And all save those who would make desirable residents have been excluded. ... It&#x27;s the prettiest, highest, healthiest and most desirable locality I ever saw. Everybody is friendly and neighborly. ... And as far as accessibility it ranks second to no residence portion of the city. We have three car lines and frequent schedules.

Like new developments throughout the United States at the time, but in stark contrast to the attitudes prevalent in the neighborhood today, Inman Park was conceived of and promoted as a segregated community.

Moreland Park was by contrast developed as a more traditional, incremental building of sub-divisions as opposed to the grand plan for Inman Park proper.

===Decline===

The arrival of the automobile allowed upper class Atlantans to live in suburbs farther north from downtown workplaces, such as Morningside and what is now considered Buckhead. Inman Park became less fashionable and the exuberant Victorian architecture came to seem dated. The mansions came to be subdivided into apartments.

Similar to other intown neighborhoods such as Virginia Highland, Inman Park fell to blight during the white middle and upper class exodus to the northern suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s, and was:

an economically depressed neighborhood of mostly blue-collar white folks, elderly couples who could not afford to move out and families on disability and welfare. They lived in rented bungalows or big houses chopped up into tiny roach-infested apartments.
===Atlanta&#x27;s first intown neighborhood to gentrify===
Driving through the neighborhood on his way to appraise stained glass windows in the doomed home of Judge Durwood T. Pye on Poplar Circle, Robert Griggs was smitten by the extraordinary architecture of the Beath-Dickey House, then a dilapidated multi-unit rental property. He and his partner, Robert Aiken, bought the house and restored it to a single-family dwelling. They were followed by others who restored homes; founded Inman Park Restoration, the neighborhood association; and created a neighborhood newsletter, a garden club to rehabilitate public spaces, and a pre-school. To publicize the progress they were making, they began a Tour of Homes with a small festival, which has grown into the hugely popular Inman Park Festival, held each spring.

===Freeway revolt against I-485===

During this same period, there was an intense fight against the I-485 freeway which was to be built through the neighborhood, although many properties in Inman Park, as well as the entire neighboring neighborhood of Copenhill, were torn down in preparation for freeway construction.

===Inman Park today===
After decades of restoration and renewal, Inman Park is now regarded as a highly desirable intown neighborhood with a mixture of rental and owner-occupied houses and condominiums. Built up as it was over decades, the neighborhood housing now ranges from tiny mill town shotguns to the Victorian mansions of the original development, intermixed with bungalows of all sizes built during the first three decades of the 20th century. Like its housing, the makeup of Inman Park has changed since its inception, with a population that is 25% non-white and of varying economic levels—although increasing housing prices are beginning to force more economic homogeneity. Since the beginning of its renewal, inclusivity and a strong sense of community have distinguished Inman Park. The neighborhood association has always welcomed renters and homeowners alike, with nominal annual dues, while the Inman Park Festival, which attracts tens of thousands of visitors every spring, brings residents together to produce the largest all-volunteer festival in Georgia. The Festival&#x27;s centerpiece is the Tour of Homes, which showcases the wide variety of sizes and types of residences in the neighborhood.

Former industrial areas on the west side of the neighborhood have been redeveloped into mixed-use complexes. The former General Pipe and Foundry site is now North Highland Steel and the Mead paper plant site is now Inman Park Village. In the early 1990s the former Atlanta Stove Works was transformed by swapping out two letters of its name and became the Atlanta Stage Works, a film and media production center that eventually housed the early Tyler Perry film studios and the National AIDS Quilt. In 2015 it was converted into a mixed-use office and restaurant space, to be added to the space across Krog Street to form the Krog Street Market.

==Geography==
Inman Park is bordered by:
*the BeltLine Eastside Trail on the west, across which lies the Old Fourth Ward
*Freedom Parkway on the north, across which lies Poncey-Highland
*Moreland Avenue on the east, across which lies Candler Park
*DeKalb Avenue on the south, across which lie Cabbagetown and Reynoldstown

Little Five Points district is located where Inman Park and Candler Park meet at Moreland Avenue and Euclid/McClendon.

==Architecture==
Inman Park contains Atlanta&#x27;s best collection of residential architecture from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Styles include Queen Anne, high-style Italianate and Romanesque mansion as well as smaller bungalows, shotguns, and foursquares. Inman Park was Atlanta&#x27;s first example of a garden suburb, with great attention paid to street layout, parks and other public space, and would inspire other Atlanta garden suburbs such as the Frederick Law Olmsted-designed Druid Hills.

There are two historic districts within the Inman Park neighborhoods: the Inman Park historic district, and the Inman Park-Moreland Historic District, originally the separate suburb of Moreland Park. 
Notable houses include:
* Beath-Dickey House
* Callan Castle (Candler mansion)
* Kriegshaber House (Wrecking Ball Brewpub)

==Other points of interest==
*The Krog Street Tunnel under the CSX Railroad connects Inman Park with Cabbagetown and is famous for street art.
*Krog Street Market is a gourmet food hall
*Edgewood Avenue in both Inman Park and Old Fourth Ward is a restaurant street that has been gaining acclaim especially since 2013.
*Highland Avenue connects Inman Park to the Poncey Highland and Virginia Highland neighborhoods. The Highland Avenue corridor offers dozens of local restaurants and shops.
*St. Hilda&#x27;s was built in 1939 as a Baptist church, and since 1978 has been a parish of the Anglican Catholic Church.

==Parks==
Parks in Inman Park include Springvale Park, a pet project of Joel Hurt and designed by the Olmsted Brothers. Part of Freedom Park lies in the neighborhood, which the BeltLine trail also borders. There are also smaller parks: Delta Park, Inman Park, the park in Inman Park Village, and the Bass Recreation Center.

==Government==
Inman Park is in NPU N. Neighbors participate in the Inman Park Neighborhood Association (IPNA).

==Education==
Inman Park residents are served by Atlanta Public Schools.

Zoned schools include:
* Mary Lin Elementary School (located in nearby Candler Park)
* Inman Middle School
* Midtown High School

==Transportation==
MARTA runs bus service and rail service. The Inman Park / Reynoldstown MARTA station is located at the south end of the neighborhood.

<text>Richard Windsor (dates unknown) served the Lewis and Clark Expedition and Corps of Discovery as a hunter, scout, and woodsman. 

Windsor was recruited at Kaskaskia in 1803, joining the party as a Private at Camp Dubois, January 1, 1804. Windsor was a great hunter and woodsmen and he was very beneficial to the expedition. He is mentioned in the Lewis and Clark journals for an accident that almost cost him his life. Crossing a when he was with Lewis, he slipped and fell. Lewis ran to the edge and told him to dig his knife in and climb up. He did so, and escaped death. After the expedition, Windsor settled in Missouri but soon rejoined the army and served until 1819. He later lived along the Sangamon River in Illinois.

<text>Kasékò is a musical genre from French Guiana. It also designates the drums as well as the dance of this musical genre. This is a fusion of African, European and American styles.

Like gwo ka and bélé, Kasékò from French Guiana is also a rhythm and a dance and is played with 3 drums and a Ti-bwa.

== Etymology ==
The Guianan Creole term &quot;Kasékò&quot; derives from the French expression &quot;casser le corps&quot; (&quot;break the body&quot;) which was used during slavery in French Guiana to indicate a swift dance.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
Kasékò is an autogenic music based on the traditional dances of African slaves and mixed with European and Amerindian cultural contributions.

== Instruments == 
The Kasékò is played with four instruments :
* Tibwa or ti-bwa ;
* Three &quot;tanbou&quot; (drum) :
** Tanbou foulé or foulé kasékò,
** Tanbou koupé or dékoupé,
** Tanbou plonbé or foulé fon.

<text>HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was the last of four central battery ironclads built for the Royal Navy in the late 1860s. Completed in 1871, the ship was briefly assigned to the Reserve Fleet as a guardship in Ireland, before she was sent out to the China Station as its flagship. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; returned four years later and resumed her duties as a guardship. She accidentally rammed and sank her sister ship, , in a heavy fog in mid-1875 and returned to the Far East in 1878. The ship ran aground twice during this deployment and returned home in 1883. After a lengthy refit, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was assigned to the Channel Fleet in 1885 and remained there until she again became a guardship in 1890. The ship was converted into a coal hulk a decade later and continued in that role until 1906 when she was sold for scrap and broken up.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Audacious&quot; class was designed as a second-class ironclad intended for overseas service. They were long between perpendiculars and had a beam of . &quot;Iron Duke&quot; had a draught of forward and aft. The &quot;Audacious&quot;-class ships displaced and had a tonnage of 3,774 tons burthen. They had a complement of 450 officers and ratings.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; had a pair of two-cylinder, horizontal-return, connecting-rod steam engines, each driving a single propeller using steam provided by six rectangular boilers. The engines were designed to give the ships a speed of ; &quot;Iron Duke&quot; reached a speed of from during her sea trials on 2 November 1870. She carried a maximum of of coal.

The &quot;Audacious&quot; class was ship-rigged with three masts and had a sail area of . Around 1871 they were re-rigged as barques with their sail area reduced to To reduce drag, the funnel was telescopic and could be lowered. Under sail alone, they could reach .
The main armament of the &quot;Audacious&quot;-class ships consisted of 10 RML rifled muzzle-loading guns. Six of these were positioned on the main deck, three on each broadside, and the other four guns were mounted on the corners of the upper deck battery. The battery protruded over the sides of the ships to give the guns a certain amount of end-on fire. The shell of the nine-inch gun weighed while the gun itself weighed . It had a muzzle velocity of and was rated with the ability to penetrate of wrought-iron armour at the muzzle.

The ships were equipped with four RML 6 in (152 mm) 71 cwt guns as chase guns, two in the bow and another pair in the stern. They fired a , shell. They also had six RBL 20 pdr rifled breech-loading guns that were used as saluting guns. In 1878, the ships received four torpedo launchers on the main deck and the 6-inch guns were replaced by four breech-loading BL 5-inch guns during the mid-1880s.

The wrought iron waterline armour belt of the &quot;Audacious&quot; class covered the entire length of the ships. It was thick amidships, backed by of teak, and thinned to six inches towards the ends of the ships. It had a total height of of which was below water and above at deep load. The main deck citadel&#x27;s ends were protected by a forward bulkhead and a one aft. The sides and embrasures of the upper battery were six inches thick, but its ends were unprotected. The ships also had a one-man conning tower with walls thick.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Iron Duke&quot;, named after the nickname for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, was the first ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was laid down at Pembroke Dockyard on 23 August 1868, launched on 1 March 1870 and was completed on 1 January 1871, at a cost of £208,763. She was initially assigned as a First Reserve Guardship at Plymouth, but was assigned as the flagship of the China Station in September. En route to the Far East, she became the first ironclad to use the Suez Canal; virtually all of her coal had to be unloaded to reduce her draught and she was towed by three tugboats through the canal in three days. Relieved by her sister ship, , &quot;Iron Duke&quot; returned to the UK in 1875. To save money on the return ship, no tugboats were hired and the ship ran aground four times and frequently scraped the sides of the canal during her four-day transit. Upon her arrival, she was paid off in May.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; recommissioned two months later and was assigned as the guardship at Hull. During the First Reserve Squadron&#x27;s summer cruise on 1 September, she was en route with three other ironclads between Dublin and Queenstown (now Cobh). In a thick fog, the ship accidentally rammed her sister, &quot;Vanguard&quot;, off Kish Bank, in Dublin Bay. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; had her bowsprit wrecked, but was otherwise little damaged. Her ram, however, had torn a hole in &quot;Vanguard&quot;″s side. The ram also damaged the watertight bulkhead between &quot;Vanguard&quot;″s engine and boiler rooms which flooded both compartments and prevented her crew from using her steam-powered pumps. The ship sank in a little over an hour after all of the crew had abandoned ship. Following the collision, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was overhauled at Plymouth Dockyard, with attention being given to the watertight doors on board. At 10:00 on 20 November 1877, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; departed from Plymouth for sea trials. She was out when it was found that the main sluice valve had been left open and she was sinking. Her crew closed the watertight doors and manned the pumps. An order was given to fire the distress signal, but it was found that there was no powder on board. The flag signal for &quot;sinking&quot; was made, but it was not noticed by for fifteen minutes. &quot;Black Prince&quot; repeated the signal to Mount Wise, which repeated the signal to Plymouth. In the meantime, a crewman had managed to close the valve. He was waist deep in water and had he been a few minutes later a diver would have been required. With the valve closed, the pumps were able to clear the water, and the ship was dry at 15:00. She put back to Plymouth, the trial being cancelled. It was subsequently revealed that four condenser valves, each diameter were involved. Difficulty in closing them was caused by excessive stiffness in the springs. This was alleviated by the fact that the valve handles had been lengthened during the refit, giving greater leverage. It was reported that efforts were made by those responsible for the refit to obstruct the Admiralty enquiry into the event.

Following the loss, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; replaced &quot;Vanguard&quot; as the guardship at Kingstown, County Dublin, where she received the latter&#x27;s crew and remained until July 1877 when the ship began a lengthy refit that lasted until August 1878. She
was inspected by Admiral Thomas Symonds, Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth, on 22 July. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; then departed Plymouth on 4 August, bound for the China Station; en route, she pulled the P&amp;O steamship off a reef in the Red Sea on 7 September after two days&#x27; effort. Vice-Admiral Robert Coote hoisted his flag aboard &quot;Iron Duke&quot; on 9 November. on 9 May 1879, she ran aground at the mouth of the Yangtze. She was refloated with assistance 36 hours later. Minor damage was sustained, and she sailed to Hiogo, Japan to be [dry]docked. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; ran aground on a sandbar entering the Huangpu River in May 1880, after five days, she was pulled free by the American paddlewheel river gunboat with little damage. Princes Arisugawa Taruhito and Arisugawa Takehito visited &quot;Iron Duke&quot; on 22 July while she was visiting Yokohama, Japan. Several weeks later, Arisugawa Takehito came aboard to serve as a midshipman. The ship struck a rock off the coast of Hokkaido en route to Aniva Bay, Sakhalin Island, on 30 July 1880. She floated off on 1 August after another ship had also grounded while trying to assist; her repairs required a month in drydock in Hong Kong. On 28 January 1881, Coote hauled down his flag and was relieved by Vice-Admiral George Willes, the new Commander-in-chief, of the China Station. On 10 October, the ship was drydocked in Nagasaki, Japan, and then sailed to Woosung, on 26 October. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; returned home in January 1883 and began a lengthy refit that included the replacement of her boilers.

On 16 April 1885, the ship became a member of Admiral Geoffrey Hornby&#x27;s Particular Service Squadron until August, when she joined the Channel Squadron. After the ironclad broke loose from her anchors in Lisbon on 24 December 1886 during a gale and accidentally rammed and sank the French steamship , &quot;Iron Duke&quot;″s crew manned one boat in search for survivors, although it is uncertain how many they saved. The following year, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; participated in Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Fleet review on 1 July 1887 at Spithead. She was reduced to reserve in 1890 and was converted to a coal hulk in 1900, serving at Kyles of Bute. The ship was transferred from Fleet Reserve to Dockyard Reserve at Portsmouth in April 1902, and eventually sold for scrap on 15 May 1906 to Galbraith of Glasgow.

<text>Ben Wa balls, also known as orgasm balls, , Venus balls, or mien-ling, are marble-sized balls, usually hollow and containing a small weight, that may be inserted into a female’s vagina, and held in place by the pubococcygeus muscles. They may be used as a sex toy by creating sexual stimulation or pleasure by rolling around in the vagina stimulating movement and/or vibration. They create a subtle stimulation that does not bring the user to immediate orgasm, but rather teases.

They may also be used for a medical purpose, such as to increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles, much as Taoist sexual practices have been used for centuries and the Kegel exercises are used today. Similar to Kegel exercises, Ben Wa balls and other shaped vaginal weightlifting equipment are recommended by gynecologists and obstetricians to increase vaginal elasticity and bladder control.

It is possible to leave the balls in place in the vagina all day, or use them while seated in a rocking chair. Health experts caution against prolonged placement of foreign objects in the vagina due to the risk of infection.

==Description==
The balls are available in a variety of forms, and may be solid, or contain clappers or chimes within. Other, larger versions made of plastic encasing lesser balls are called Duotone balls. The balls sometimes comprise multiple metal covered balls linked by either a chain or silk string for easy removal, but they do not have an adequately flared base for safe anal play. The balls should not be confused with anal kegel exercisers and prostate stimulators.

==History==
Ben Wa balls have a varied history; their origin and method of construction varies depending upon location. Most information concerning Ben Wa balls is vague and apocryphal. Originally they were made of a single ball placed in the vagina, used to enhance the act of sexual intercourse, but then evolved into multiple metal covered balls linked by either a chain or silk string for easy removal.

==History==
The first trace of human presence in Porrentruy is a mesolithic tool that was found in the backyard of the Hôtel-Dieu. Scattered, individual objects have also been found from the neolithic, the late Bronze Age and the Iron Age. The first known settlement in what became Porrentruy goes back to the Roman era. In 1983, the ruins of a Gallo-Roman temple were discovered in the cemetery on the north of town, and Roman coins were found there. Near the town, a kilometre long (0.6 mile) section of the Augst-Epomanduodurum (now Mandeure) Roman road was discovered.
In the backyard of the Hôtel-Dieu the charred remains of a building from the 10th or 11th century were discovered. However, the first historical mention of the name occurs in 1136 as &quot;Purrentru&quot;. The name presumably comes from the Latin &quot;pons Ragentrudis&quot; (Ragentrud bridge). Ragentrud was the wife of the Frankish King Dagobert I. The German form of the name, &quot;Pruntrut&quot; may have a separate etymology from &quot;Bruntrutum&quot;, which means an &quot;abundant spring&quot;.

The first settlement was established in 1140 in the vicinity of the Church of Saint-Germain, which was built in the Early Middle Ages. The Counts of Pfirt, who owned the region around Porrentruy, built a castle on a defensible hill and made it the capital of the Ajoie territory. A settlement (now known as the Faubourg de France) was founded at the foot of the castle, with another south on the opposite hill. The city wall was probably built before 1283 and surrounded the two settlements, but not the parish church of Saint-Germain.

In 1236 the Counts of Pfirt pledged the town to the Counts of Montbéliard, however, they retained their rights to the Ajoie until 1281 when they sold the territory to the Bishop of Basel. The Counts of Montbéliard refused to hand over Porrentruy, which led Bishop Henry of Isny to request support from King Rudolph I of Habsburg. After six weeks under siege, the Count relented and handed it over to the Bishop. On 20 April 1283, the king asked the Bishop of Basel to grant Porrentruy a town charter and make it a free Imperial city. While the Counts of Montbéliard retained some power in the town, their influence waned during the 13th century.

Financial difficulties forced the Bishop to sell the Ajoie (including Porrentruy) back to the lords of Montbéliard in 1386. But in 1461, the town once again became subject to the episcopal see. Because of the Reformation in Basel, the Bishopric moved its official headquarters to Porrentruy in 1527. Under Bishop Jakob Christoph Blarer von Wartensee, who reigned from 1575 to 1608, the town reached the apogee of its importance. In his time, many architectural projects, including expansion of the castle and the building of a Jesuit college, were undertaken. This period of prosperity ended in 1618 with the outbreak of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Porrentruy was repeatedly occupied, besieged, and plundered.

The first parish church of Saint-Germain was replaced in the 13th century by a new building, which underwent several renovations. The Church of Saint-Pierre was completed in 1349 and became the parish church in 1475. The cathedral chapter was established in 1377. Several religious orders were active in the city, including the Jesuits who built their college in 1591. In addition to the Jesuits other orders included the Ursulines (1619), the Sisters of the Annonciade (permanently established in 1646) and the Capuchins (1663).

The first uprising against the Bishop&#x27;s power was under the Comité de la Commune de Porrentruy on 20 August 1790, but they were unable to expel the Bishop. However, on 27 April 1792, French Revolutionary troops invaded the city and drove the Bishop out. Porrentruy became the capital of a dependent republic, which was then incorporated into France in 1793 as the Département du Mont-Terrible. In 1800, this department was incorporated into the Département du Haut-Rhin as a sub-département. During the War of the Sixth Coalition against Napoleon, Allied troops entered Porrentruy on 24 December 1813. Following their liberation, the future of this former episcopal seat was uncertain. The government divided into two parties, the Episcopal party that sought the return of the prince bishop as the head of a Swiss canton, while the French party wanted to retain the current secular government. However, soon after the fall of Napoleon, the municipality was given to the Canton of Bern (in 1815) to compensate for the loss of the Canton of Vaud, which had become a separate canton in 1803.

Both factions, the religious and the secular, retained power in the town in the following years. The political life in the 19th century was characterized by the severe conflict between Liberal-Radicals and the Catholic Conservatives. The secular side gained power in 1860, when the mayor, Joseph Trouillat, was forced out of office. The Radicals retained the mayor&#x27;s office and a majority of the town council from 1860 until 1972.+On April 24, 1917, the Swiss town of Porrentruy was mistakenly shelled by German artillery during World War I. The artillery fire originated from German positions located near the French border, specifically around Delle, which is approximately 5 to 10 kilometers from Porrentruy. This area was relatively close to the Western Front, with the front lines running about 40 kilometers away to the north.
Approximately 20 shells were fired into Porrentruy, resulting in significant damage to civilian property and causing at least two civilian fatalities along with injuries to around five to ten individuals. The bombardment was an unfortunate mistake, as German forces were targeting nearby military positions but inadvertently struck neutral Swiss territory. Following the incident, the Swiss government lodged a formal protest against Germany for violating their neutrality, highlighting the complexities and risks associated with maintaining neutrality during a time of widespread conflict in Europe.

Until World War I, Porrentruy was the cultural center of the region and had a larger population than Delémont. However, with the increase in automobile traffic, its situation on the edge of the country became a liability and caused economic stagnation. In the second half of the 20th century, tensions between the French-speaking minority in the Canton of Bern and the German-speaking majority led to the creation of the new Canton of Jura on 1 January 1979. To the chagrin of the inhabitants of Ajoie, Delémont was chosen as the cantonal capital.

==Transportation==
Porrentruy lies at the junction of two railway lines: the Delémont–Delle railway line of Swiss Federal Railways and the Porrentruy–Bonfol railway line of Chemins de fer du Jura. The first railway line opened in 1872, connecting Porrentruy with Delle, in France, via Boncourt. A further connection south to Glovelier and the rest of the Swiss railway network opened in 1877. The branch line to Bonfol opened in 1901.

The municipality lies on the first stretch of the motorway (A16 or E27) to open (in 1998) in the canton of Jura between Delémont and Belfort, France. The motorway is meant to be completed in 2016, the difficult topography of the Jura only allowing the opening of short sections, one by one. This explains why the international railway played such an important role in the economic rise of Porrentruy because the railway follows the course of the Allaine river to the economic rail hub at Belfort.

<text>The Saint Martin national football team is the football team of the Collectivity of Saint Martin, the French half of the island of Saint Martin which was previously part of the French overseas department of Guadeloupe (not to be confused with the team of the Dutch half, the Sint Maarten national football team) and is controlled by the Comité de Football des Îles du Nord. Saint Martin is not a member of FIFA, and is therefore not eligible to enter the World Cup, but it does compete in CONCACAF competitions.

==History==
Saint Martin played their first competitive match during the 1990 Caribbean Cup qualifiers against British Virgin Islands, winning 3–0. They beat Anguilla (4–0) and Cayman Islands (8–3 on aggregate) to advance to the final qualifying round where they failed to progress, losing 1–0 to Jamaica in the decisive group game.

Saint Martin would not enter the next nine Caribbean Cup tournaments, before returning in the 2001 qualification process, beating Anguilla and Montserrat before finishing six points behind Cuba in the final round of qualifying. In 2005 qualifying, Saint Martin failed to advance past the first qualifying round, losing heavily to Jamaica (12–0). From 2007 to 2012, Saint Martin were knocked out in the first round in every qualifying competition.

In August 2014, Saint Martin played a friendly against the British Virgin Islands, the territory&#x27;s first match since 2012. At that time, SMFA president Fabrice Baly announced a 3-year project to fully return to Caribbean international football. He established long-term objectives of attracting the attention of international recruiters and qualifying for the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Saint Martin withdrew from 2017 Caribbean Cup qualification, ending the project that Baly had started.

In 2019, Saint Martin entered the qualification for the first CONCACAF Nations League, losing all four of their matches and finishing bottom of the standings, placing them into League C where they finished third, three points off from qualifying for League B.

<doc id="1227901" wikidata="Q20001" url="?curid=1227901" title="Collision Course (EP)">
<text>Collision Course is a collaborative EP from American rapper Jay-Z and rock band Linkin Park, released on November 30, 2004, by Roc-A-Fella, Machine Shop, Warner Bros. and Def Jam. From Linkin Park&#x27;s catalog, &quot;Collision Course&quot; features three songs from &quot;Meteora&quot; and four from &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. From Jay-Z&#x27;s catalog, it features three songs from &quot;The Black Album&quot;, one from &quot;Vol. 3: Life and Times of S. Carter&quot;, one from &quot;Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life&quot; and one from &quot;The Blueprint&quot;. Before the album, Jay-Z had released collaborations with The Roots and R. Kelly, and Linkin Park had collaborated with various artists on their remix album &quot;Reanimation&quot;.

The album was inspired by &quot;The Grey Album&quot; by Danger Mouse, which was a mash-up album between Jay-Z and The Beatles. MTV had originally planned on mashing up only one or two songs, but the project was eventually expanded to a six-song album. The production on the album was mostly handled by Mike Shinoda and Jay-Z, and it was recorded between July 16 and July 19. The album spawned one single, &quot;Numb/Encore&quot; which won Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 48th Grammy Awards. The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics but despite that was a commercial success. It debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 368,000 copies in its first week.

==Overview==
Due to its short running time at 21:18, with six tracks in total included on the disc, the release has been identified as an EP. All of the tracks included are mashups combining songs by both artists.

The DVD contains behind-the-scenes new footage of the making of the album, as well as the second take of all of the Collision Course songs at The Roxy Theatre on July 18, 2004. Also included are the five scenes from the concert shown on &quot;MTV Ultimate Mash-Ups&quot; and a picture gallery.

The first single released from the EP, &quot;Numb/Encore&quot;, achieved significant airplay on the charts, and stayed on six months after its release. &quot;Points of Authority/99 Problems/One Step Closer&quot; was also released to the radio in the US, but was never featured on the Billboard Charts – the videos for both that track and &quot;Jigga What/Faint&quot; were also seen on Kerrang! in the UK. &quot;Izzo/In the End&quot; was also heavily promoted on the official Linkin Park websites.

==Background and production==

Mike Shinoda revealed in his 2004 Grammy acceptance speech that he would be mashing up with Jay-Z for a record under MTV&#x27;s Mash Ups show.

The network allowed Jay-Z to choose a group or artist for the mash-up. Jay contacted Shinoda, who began experimenting with mixing the tracks before sending some examples to him. As a result, Jay-Z began working with Shinoda through email. The two decided that instead of combining the existing tracks for the live performance on MTV, they wanted to re-work and re-record parts of the songs to make them fit better. Shinoda explains, &quot;Jay and I realized it&#x27;s better to re-perform the rap vocals if you&#x27;re gonna do it to a new beat because the vibe changes and you have to deliver your verse a little differently.&quot; Shinoda asked his bandmates to re-record instrumental and vocal tracks as well, and ultimately both parties decided they wanted to release the studio tracks. The entire album was put together within four days.

Sometimes, behind-the-scenes audio can be heard within the album, such as Jay-Z saying &quot;You&#x27;re wasting your talent, Randy!&quot; before &quot;Big Pimpin&#x27;/Papercut&quot;, or Shinoda saying &quot;This is fun&quot; before &quot;Izzo/In the End&quot;.

&quot;Collision Course&quot; was the first album of Linkin Park that contained a Parental Advisory sticker, since most of Jay-Z&#x27;s verses contain profanity (although Shinoda and Chester Bennington are also heard using vulgar language on the album). This album was also made in an edited/censored version. However, the clean version of the album left the words &quot;bitch&quot;, &quot;ass&quot;, and &quot;hoes&quot; uncensored, which means that &quot;Izzo/In the End&quot; is the same on the clean and explicit versions.

A year after the release of &quot;Collision Course&quot;, Jay-Z was the executive producer on Mike Shinoda&#x27;s solo effort Fort Minor&#x27;s &quot;The Rising Tied&quot;. Also, the song &quot;High Road&quot; from the same record talks about how some critics negatively received &quot;Collision Course&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Collision Course&quot; received generally mixed reviews from music critics. David Jeffries of AllMusic praised the album, calling it &quot;awesomely fun&quot;. K.B. Tindal of &quot;HipHopDX&quot; also equally praised the album, saying that the project &quot;will open a passageway for artists who want to dare to be different as well as those who want to work hard to maintain that difference.&quot; Steve Juon of RapReviews called the album &quot;an experiment which bodes well since for the most part these two artists each other.&quot;

Meanwhile, Raymond Fiore of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, gave a negative review of the album, saying that the pairing of Linkin Park and Jay-Z &quot;comes off like a sanitized nonevent.&quot; At the 48th Grammy Awards, the song &quot;Numb/Encore&quot;, a mash-up of &quot;Numb&quot; by Linkin Park and &quot;Encore&quot; by Jay-Z, won the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Collision Course&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 368,000 copies in its first week, according to Nielsen Soundscan. This became Jay-Z eighth US number one album and Linkin Park&#x27;s second. It also became the first EP ever to top the chart since Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; in 1994. In its second week, the EP dropped to number nine on the chart, selling an additional 186,000 copies. In its third week, the EP dropped to number ten on the chart, selling 236,000 more copies. In its fourth week, the EP climbed to number eight on the chart, selling 283,000 more copies. As of August 2009, the EP has sold 1,934,000 copies in the US. On August 15, 2017, the EP was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over two million units in the United States.

<doc id="1227905" wikidata="Q569389" url="?curid=1227905" title="Words per minute">
<text>Words per minute, commonly abbreviated as WPM (sometimes lowercased as wpm), is a measure of words processed in a minute, often used as a measurement of the speed of typing, reading or Morse code sending and receiving.

== Alphanumeric entry ==
Since words vary in length, for the purpose of measurement of text entry the definition of each &quot;word&quot; is often standardized to be five characters or keystrokes long in English, including spaces and punctuation. For example, under such a method applied to plain English text the phrase &quot;I run&quot; counts as one word, but &quot;rhinoceros&quot; and &quot;let&#x27;s talk&quot; would both count as two.

Karat et al. found in one study of average computer users in 1999 that the average rate for transcription was 32.5 words per minute, and 19.0 words per minute for composition. In the same study, when the group was divided into &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot;, and &quot;slow&quot; groups, the average speeds were 40 wpm, 35 wpm, and 23 wpm, respectively.

With the onset of the era of desktop computers and smartphones, fast typing skills became much more widespread. As of 2019, the average typing speed on a mobile phone was 36.2 wpm with 2.3% uncorrected errors—there were significant correlations with age, level of English proficiency, and number of fingers used to type. Some typists have sustained speeds over 200 wpm for a 15-second typing test with simple English words.

Typically, professional typists type at speeds of 43 to 80 wpm, while some positions can require 80 to 95 (usually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other time-sensitive typing jobs), and some advanced typists work at speeds above 120 wpm. Two-finger typists, sometimes also referred to as &quot;hunt and peck&quot; typists, commonly reach sustained speeds of about 37 wpm for memorized text and 27 wpm when copying text, but in bursts may be able to reach much higher speeds. From the 1920s through the 1970s, typing speed (along with shorthand speed) was an important secretarial qualification, and typing contests were popular and often publicized by typewriter companies as promotional tools.

== Stenotype ==

Stenotype keyboards enable the trained user to input text as fast as 360 wpm at very high accuracy for an extended period, which is sufficient for real-time activities such as court reporting or closed captioning. While training dropout rates are very high — in some cases only 10% or even fewer graduate — stenotype students are usually able to reach speeds of 100–120 wpm within six months, which is faster than most alphanumeric typists. Guinness World Records gives 360 wpm with 97.23% accuracy as the highest achieved speed using a stenotype.

== Numeric entry ==
The numeric entry or 10-key speed is a measure of one&#x27;s ability to manipulate the numeric keypad found on most modern separate computer keyboards. It is used to measure speed for jobs such as data entry of number information on items such as remittance advice, bills, or checks, as deposited to lock boxes. It is measured in keystrokes per hour (KPH). Many jobs require a certain KPH, often 8,000 or 10,000.

== Handwriting ==
For an adult population (age range 18–64) the average speed of copying is 68 letters per minute (approximately 13 wpm), with the range from a minimum of 26 to a maximum of 113 letters per minute (approximately 5 to 20 wpm).

A study of police interview records showed that the highest speed fell in the range 120–155 characters per minute, the highest possible limit being 190 characters per minute.

According to various studies the speed of handwriting of 3–7 graders varies from 25 to 94 letters per minute.

Using stenography (shorthand) methods, this rate increases greatly. Handwriting speeds up to 350 words per minute have been achieved in shorthand competitions.

== Reading and comprehension ==
Words per minute is a common metric for assessing reading speed and is often used in the context of remedial skills evaluation, as well as in the context of speed reading, where it is a controversial measure of reading performance.

A word in this context is the same as in the context of speech.

Research done in 2012 measured the speed at which subjects read a text aloud, and found the typical range of speeds across 17 different languages to be 184±29 wpm or 863±234 characters per minute. However, the number of wpm varied between languages, even for languages that use the Latin or Cyrillic alphabets: as low as 161±18 for Finnish and as high as 228±30 for English. This was because different languages have different average word lengths (longer words in such languages as Finnish and shorter words in English). However, the number of characters per minute tends to be around 1000 for all the tested languages. For the tested Asian languages that use particular writing systems (Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese) these numbers are lower.

Scientific studies have demonstrated that reading—defined here as capturing and decoding all the words on every page—faster than 900 wpm is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye.

While proofreading materials, people are able to read English at 200 wpm on paper, and 180 wpm on a monitor. [Those numbers from Ziefle, 1998, are for studies that used monitors prior to 1992. See Noyes &amp; Garland 2008 for a modern tech view of equivalence.]

== Speech and listening ==
Audiobooks are recommended to be 150–160 words per minute, which is the range that people comfortably hear and vocalize words.

Slide presentations tend to be closer to 100–125 wpm for a comfortable pace, auctioneers can speak at about 250 wpm, and the fastest speaking policy debaters speak from 350 to over 500 words per minute. Internet speech calculators show that various things influence words per minute including nervousness.

An example of an agglutinative language, the average rate of Turkish speech is reported to be about 220 syllables per minute. When the time spent for the silent parts of speech are removed, the so-called average articulation rate reaches 310 syllables per minute. The average number of syllables per (written) word has been measured as 2.6. For a comparison, Flesch has suggested that the conversational English for consumers aims 1.5 syllables per word, although these measures are dependent on corpus.

John Moschitta Jr. was listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, for a time, as the world&#x27;s fastest speaker, being able to talk at 586 wpm. He has since been surpassed by Steve Woodmore, who achieved a rate of 637 wpm.

== Sign language ==
In the realm of American Sign Language, the American Sign Language University (ASLU) specifies a cutoff proficiency for students who clock a signing speed of 110-130 wpm.

== Morse code ==
Morse code uses variable length sequences of short and long duration &quot;signals&quot; (dits and dahs, colloquially called dots and dashes) to represent source information &quot;e.g.&quot;, sequences for the letter &quot;K&quot; and numeral &quot;2&quot; are respectively () and (). This variability complicates the measurement of Morse code speed rated in words per minute. Using telegram messages, the average English word length is about five characters, each averaging 5.124 dot durations or baud. Spacing between words should also be considered, being seven dot durations in the USA and five in British territories. So the average British telegraph word was 30.67 dot times. So the baud rate of a Morse code is × word per minute rate.

It is standard practice to use two different such &quot;standard words&quot; to measure Morse code speeds in words per minute. The standard words are: &quot;PARIS&quot; and &quot;CODEX&quot;. In Morse code &quot;PARIS&quot; has a dot duration of 50, while &quot;CODEX&quot; has 60.

Although many countries no longer require it for licensing, Morse is still widely used by amateur radio (&quot;ham&quot;) operators. Experienced hams routinely send Morse at 20 words per minute, using manually operated hand telegraph keys; enthusiasts such as members of The CW Operators&#x27; Club routinely send and receive Morse code at speeds up to 60 wpm. The upper limit for Morse operators attempting to write down Morse code received by ear using paper and pencil is roughly 20 wpm. Many skilled Morse code operators can receive Morse code by ear mentally without writing down the information at speeds up to 70 wpm. To write down the Morse code information manually at speeds higher than 20 wpm it is usual for the operators to use a typewriter or computer keyboard to enable higher speed copying.

In the United States a commercial radiotelegraph operator&#x27;s license is still issued, although there is almost no demand for it, since for long distance communication ships now use the satellite-based Global Maritime Distress and Safety System. Besides a written examination, proficiency at receiving Morse at 20 wpm plain language and 16 wpm in code groups must be demonstrated.

High-speed telegraphy contests are still held. The fastest Morse code operator was Theodore Roosevelt McElroy copying at 75.6 wpm using a typewriter at the 1939 world championship.

<text>Los Kjarkas is a Bolivian band from the Capinota province in the department of Cochabamba, and one of the most popular Andean folk music bands in the country&#x27;s history. Among the styles they play are Saya, tuntuna, huayno, and carnavales. The instruments they use include the charango, quena, zampoña, ronroco, guitar, and bombo.

The band&#x27;s leader has always been singer, guitarist, and songwriter Gonzalo Hermosa González, who formed the band with his brothers Élmer Hermosa González and Ulises Hermosa González, as well as Gastón Guardia Bilboa and Ramiro de la Zerda. De la Zerda left the group to form Grupo Fortaleza and Ulises Hermosa died of cancer in 1992, being replaced by Eduardo Yáñez Loayza, Rolando Malpartida Porcel and José Luis Morales Rodríguez. By 2002, Lin Angulo, Gonzalo Hermosa Camacho, and Japanese-born Makoto Shishido had replaced Yáñez, Porcel, and Rodríguez. Makoto joined the band after seeing them play in Japan. In the later 2000s, Élmer Hermosa was diagnosed with diabetes. In 2010, Edwin Castellanos, who was in the band from 1983 to 1995, became mayor of the city of Cochabamba. 

Kjarkas have founded two schools teaching Andean folk music: the Musical School of Kjarkas (Lima, Peru) and La Fundación Kjarkas (Ecuador). They have toured across Japan, Europe, Scandinavia, the United States, South America, and Australia, and have composed over 350 songs. Among their most popular are &quot;Imillitay&quot;, &quot;Al Final&quot;, &quot;Canto a la mujer de mi pueblo&quot;, and &quot;Pequeño Amor&quot;.

An unauthorized translation of their song &quot;Llorando se fue&quot; by French producers Jean Karakos and Olivier Lorsac resulted in Kaoma&#x27;s hit &quot;Lambada&quot;. After a successful lawsuit, Kaoma paid to license the song. The song was also sampled on Don Omar&#x27;s &quot;Taboo&quot; and on Jennifer López&#x27;s single &quot;On the Floor&quot;. Also &quot;Wayayay&quot; was covered by Tarkan as &quot;Gelip Te Halimi Gördün Mü ?&quot; (&quot;Did You Ever Come To See My Situation ?&quot; in Turkish) at &quot;Yine Sensiz&quot; (&quot;Without You Again&quot; in Turkish), whose debut album was in 1992.

The group&#x27;s music was also used for the Argentine-Dutch film &quot;Bolivia&quot; (2001).
The group&#x27;s cultural heritage is passed down in the next generation of Hermosa blood with the popular youth group band Chila Jatun, made up by the sons of this influential Bolivian group.

They have been rewarded by the Bolivian Government the Banner of Gold

<doc id="1227922" wikidata="Q4773096" url="?curid=1227922" title="Anthony Miers">
<text>Rear Admiral Sir Anthony Cecil Capel Miers, (11 November 1906 – 30 June 1985), known as &quot;Crap Miers&quot; and &quot;Gamp&quot;, was a Royal Navy officer who served in the submarine service during the Second World War.

Miers was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was allegedly responsible for two war crime incidents, while commanding , including the shooting of seven Germans in a life raft.

==Early life==
Born in 1906 in Inverness, Scotland, the son of an army captain killed in the First World War, Miers was educated at Stubbington House School in Gosport, Edinburgh Academy, and Wellington College. In 1924 he joined the Royal Navy as a special entry cadet and volunteered for the submarine service in 1929. He could be hot-tempered, and in 1933 was court martialled for striking a rating. Miers&#x27; career however continued, with his first submarine command (1936–7). He then served in the battleship , before joining, as a lieutenant commander, the staff of the commander-in-chief, Home Fleet (1939–40), where he was mentioned in despatches.

==War service==
In November 1940 Miers was given command of HM Submarine &quot;Torbay&quot;. While working up, &quot;Torbay&quot; collided with the British tanker &quot;Vancouver&quot; in Loch Long though no serious damage was caused.

&quot;Torbay&quot; began its first patrol in March 1941. The submarine left at very short notice, with half the crew on leave and replaced by members of the spare crew of the depot ship, the reason being that the German battleships &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, had arrived at Brest and the Royal Navy wanted them shadowed in case they sailed for the Atlantic sea lanes. The submarine later continued to Gibraltar, then Alexandria, Egypt to join the 1st Submarine Flotilla.

On 27 April 1941, while on patrol off Cape Ferrato, Miers attacked a two-masted single-funnelled merchant ship of about 4,000 GRT. &quot;Torbay&quot; fired two torpedoes but both missed.

&quot;Torbay&quot;&#x27;s third war patrol was in the northern Aegean Sea. On 28 May 1941, &quot;Torbay&quot; sank two Greek caiques with gunfire, then torpedoed and damaged the Vichy French tanker &quot;Alberta&quot; off Cape Hellas.

In 1989 former Royal Naval officer and broadcaster Ludovic Kennedy published his autobiography, in which he describes &quot;a submarine atrocity&quot; on the night of 9 July 1941, which gave rise to the accusation of &#x27;war crimes&#x27;. According to the accounts, on two separate occasions Miers ordered the machine-gunning of several shipwrecked German soldiers in rafts who had jumped overboard when their vessels were sunk by the &quot;Torbay&quot;. These events were witnessed and reported by acting First Lieutenant Paul Chapman who reported &quot;everything and everybody was destroyed by one sort of gunfire or another&quot;. Miers also made no attempt to conceal his actions, his patrol log recording: &quot;Submarine cast off, and with the Lewis gun accounted for the soldiers in the rubber raft to prevent them from regaining their ship...&quot; When informed of Miers&#x27; actions, Flag Officer Submarines, Admiral Max Horton wrote to the Admiralty about the possibility of German reprisals: &quot;As far as I am aware, the enemy has not made a habit of firing on personnel in the water or on rafts even when such personnel were members of the fighting services; since the incidents referred to in &quot;Torbay&#x27;s&quot; report, he may feel justified in doing so.&quot; The Admiralty then sent a strongly worded letter to Miers advising him not to repeat the practices of his last patrol.

According to historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas in his 1979 work &quot;The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, 1939–1945&quot;, the incident was one of several instances of the Royal Navy sinking Greek ships believed to be transporting German soldiers and then firing on survivors in the water or in lifeboats. All reports of such incidents were investigated by the Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, which collected depositions from surviving German and Greek witnesses supporting Kennedy&#x27;s claims regarding the incident.

By now, Miers had carried out nine successful patrols in HMS &quot;Torbay&quot; in the Mediterranean theatre, had received the Distinguished Service Order and Bar, and had been promoted to commander in December 1941. His tenth patrol in HMS &quot;Torbay&quot; in March 1942 saw the incident which earned him the VC. Whilst on patrol in &quot;Torbay&quot; off the Greek coast on the 4 March 1942, Miers sighted a northbound convoy of four troopships entering the South Corfu Channel and, since they had been too far distant for him to attack initially, he decided to follow in the hope of catching them in Corfu harbour. During the night 4/5 March, &quot;Torbay&quot; approached undetected up the channel and remained on the surface charging her battery. The convoy passed straight through the channel but on the morning of the 5 March, in glassy sea conditions, Miers successfully attacked two store ships present in the roadstead and then brought &quot;Torbay&quot; safely back to the open sea. The submarine endured 40 depth charges and had been in closely patrolled enemy waters for seventeen hours.

The citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; read:
His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

From December 1942 Miers served as submarine liaison officer to the American Pacific Fleet, and was later made a commander of the US Legion of Merit. From July 1944 he was Commander (Submarines) of the 8th Submarine Flotilla in the Far East based at Trincomalee, Sri Lanka and later Fremantle, Australia.

==Post war==
Miers remained in the navy after the war, and was promoted to captain in December 1946. He was commanding officer of the naval establishments and then HMS &quot;Blackcap&quot;, a Fleet Air Arm station (1948–50), and the 1st submarine squadron (1950–52), and the Royal Naval College, Greenwich (1952–4). He commanded the aircraft carrier for a year from 9 December 1954. He was promoted to rear admiral in January 1956, and became Flag Officer, Middle East, until his retirement in August 1959. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1958, and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1959.

Miers served for many years as the national president of the Submarine Old Comrades&#x27; Association. He died at his home in Roehampton, London, on 30 June 1985. He is buried at Tomnahurich Cemetery, Inverness, Scotland, in the Roman Catholic Section.

<doc id="1227923" wikidata="Q542287" url="?curid=1227923" title="David Burrows (footballer)">
<text>David Burrows (born 25 October 1968) is an English former professional footballer who played as a left-back.

As a player he notably played in the Premier League for Liverpool, West Ham United, Everton and Coventry City. Whilst a Liverpool player he won the Football League, the FA Cup and twice won the Charity Shield and he played his part in the earlier stages of Everton&#x27;s successful FA Cup campaign in 1995. He also played in the Football League for West Bromwich Albion, Birmingham City and Sheffield Wednesday as well as the England Under-21 and B teams.

==Playing career==
Burrows completed an apprenticeship at West Bromwich Albion and signed professional forms with the club as a 17-year-old in 1985, after a period in the Tipton Town youth team. He spent three years at The Hawthorns, playing 46 times and scoring one goal. He was signed by Liverpool for £550,000 in October 1988, making his debut two days later in a 0–0 draw against Coventry City at Anfield. Vying for a place with Steve Staunton meant that Burrows&#x27; first team opportunities were limited in his first season at Liverpool.

Burrows, an England under-21 international, joined his teammates in mourning for the 96 fans who lost their lives at the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989. He along with the rest of Liverpool Football Club were commended for the way they conducted themselves after the disaster and he attended numerous funerals and comforted the victims&#x27; families and friends. At this time he was not regularly featuring in the team, with the equally inexperienced Steve Staunton enjoying an extended run at left back which lasted through to the end of the season, including the 3–2 FA Cup final victory over Everton in which Barry Venison was selected for a place on the substitute&#x27;s bench ahead of Burrows.

The following year, with Staunton more frequently deployed in midfield and manager Dalglish prepared to rotate his squad more, Burrows played more regularly and won his first honour with Liverpool when they clinched the League title, finishing nine points clear of Aston Villa. When Dalglish quit in 1991 and was replaced by Graeme Souness, Burrows found his chances more restricted, though he did score his first Liverpool goal on 31 August 1991 in a 3–1 victory over Everton at Anfield. Later that season he was picked by Souness for the 1992 FA Cup final, which Liverpool won, beating Sunderland 2–0 at Wembley.

Burrows left for West Ham United in September 1993, along with Mike Marsh, as part of a deal that took Julian Dicks to Anfield. Burrows had appeared 193 times for the Reds, scoring three goals. He made his West Ham debut in September 1993, just a day after joining them, in a 2–0 league win over Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. He spent just a single year at Upton Park, appearing 35 times scoring twice; in his second West Ham game in a 5–1 League Cup win against Chesterfield and in a 3–1 home win against Manchester City Although he started the 1994–95 season, he played only four games before moving to Everton as part of a deal which saw the return of Tony Cottee to West Ham. Burrows joined Everton in September 1994, featuring in the early stages of Everton&#x27;s glorious 1994–95 FA Cup campaign, starting the third and fourth round ties against Derby County and Bristol City respectively.

Burrows spent just six months at Everton, playing 23 times, before he was on the move again, this time to Ron Atkinson&#x27;s Coventry City, in March 1995, or a fee of £1.1 million. Atkinson said at the time he knew of &quot;no better English left-back&quot;. &quot;If he plays to his best form, there&#x27;s no reason why he shouldn&#x27;t make the squad for the European Championships.&quot; He again made a quick début, appearing two days after signing in a 0–0 league draw with Southampton at the Dell. He suffered frequent injury during his four years at Highfield Road, but still made 130 appearances.

In 2000, failing to regain his place in the City line-up after returning from injury and unable to agree a new deal with the club, he moved again to Coventry&#x27;s Midland rivals Birmingham City, in June 2000, on a free transfer. He made his debut in September 2000 in a 1–0 league victory over Sheffield United at St Andrew&#x27;s. He helped Birmingham reach the 2001 Football League Cup Final. Burrows was left out of the match-day squad for the final against former club Liverpool, but he was on the pitch as a substitute as they beat Ipswich Town in the semi-finals. He spent less than two years at Birmingham, playing 30 matches. Burrows&#x27; time at Birmingham was marred with disagreements with managers Trevor Francis and Steve Bruce. A training ground incident in February 2002 involving Bruce and Burrows resulted in him being thrown out of the club.

In March 2002, Sheffield Wednesday signed Burrows on a free transfer and yet again he made a quick début, this time the following day, in a 0–0 league draw against Gillingham at Hillsborough. Injuries once again dogged Burrows as he injured both his collarbone and hamstring whilst at Sheffield Wednesday, forcing him to quit the professional game in May 2003.

==Personal life==

After retirement he moved to France with his family where he got involved with the local football community, playing and coaching several local football teams, notably FC Sarlat Marcillac where he led he team to victory in the &quot;Coupe de Dordogne&quot;. He now spends time maintaining his holiday rental properties in the area.

<doc id="1227927" wikidata="Q1146291" url="?curid=1227927" title="Albert Wesker">
<text>is a character in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; survival horror video game series created by the Japanese company Capcom. He was first introduced in the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (1996) as the captain of the Special Tactics and Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) unit of the Raccoon Police Department. Wesker has been one of the series&#x27; main antagonists as a member of the pharmaceutical conglomerate Umbrella Corporation, the primary antagonistic faction, manipulating story events behind the scenes. To further his own plans, Wesker betrays his allies, fakes his death, gains superhuman abilities, and works with both Umbrella&#x27;s mysterious rival company and their successors in the field of biological weapons development until his ultimate defeat by Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar in &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; (2009).

Wesker appears in several &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games, novelizations, and films and has also appeared in other game franchises, including &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot;, &quot;Teppen,&quot; and &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot;. In his first appearance, Wesker was voiced by Pablo Kuntz, while D. C. Douglas voiced the character across most of his other appearances; in Japanese dubbings, Jouji Nakata has consistently voiced the character across all of his video game appearances. Several actors have portrayed Wesker, including Jason O&#x27;Mara, Shawn Roberts, Tom Hopper, and Lance Reddick, in the live-action &quot;Resident Evil&quot; films and television series.

Wesker was conceptualized by writer Kenichi Iwao, who envisioned Wesker as an arrogant, intelligent, and unsympathetic character. Wesker is presented as a virologist focused on advancing human evolution and later becomes a bio-terrorist obsessed with eradicating humanity. He possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and regeneration, and he mutates into a more powerful form in &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;. Wesker has received mostly positive reviews from video game publications, with critics praising him for being one of the most memorable video game villains, particularly his death, but critiquing him for appearing as a one-dimensional and stereotypical villain.

==Concept and design==
Albert Wesker is an American of Caucasian descent. He was created by director Shinji Mikami and designer Isao Ohishi. The main characters were originally intended to be cyborg police officers, until writer Kenichi Iwao discarded the idea and completely redesigned the characters and the game&#x27;s backstory. He envisioned Wesker as a former special forces member who possessed exceptional intelligence and physical prowess, with a cold demeanor that matched his egotistical mindset. His co-workers suggested making the character a traitor who betrays the protagonist. The game&#x27;s designers ultimately developed Wesker into the commander of the protagonists&#x27; elite police task force, who is secretly employed as a virologist for the Umbrella Corporation. His drive to develop viral agents and engineer the ultimate lifeform is a central plotline in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series. Wesker is depicted as a white male with blonde hair in the video games and movies. Designer Jun Takeuchi helped create Wesker&#x27;s in-game character model in the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. He suggested giving Wesker a pair of black sunglasses to help differentiate him from the other characters, which became a staple of his appearance throughout the series.

During the finale of &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;, Wesker fully sheds his human appearance when he infects himself with the Uroboros virus, a volatile and mutagenic viral agent. The Uroboros virus grants him more strength while also transforming his arms into tentacles that allow him to absorb and wield metallic objects as weapons. The early concept sketches of his Uroboros mutation differed significantly from the final version. In the initial design, his combat style would have relied solely on his mental powers to manipulate Uroboros. This concept was shaped by the one-on-one battle between Wesker and Chris Redfield, without a co-op partner. However, with the addition of Sheva Alomar as a co-op partner, adjustments were made to bolster Wesker&#x27;s abilities and provide him with additional makeshift weaponry for the final boss battle. Following Wesker&#x27;s demise, producer Masachika Kawata stated that there was no possibility of the character returning.

===Voice-over and live-action actors===

Wesker was originally voiced by Pablo Kuntz, who said that Capcom&#x27;s staff gave him limited direction and that he did not fully understand the game&#x27;s plot at the time of recording. He later reflected on his performance, stating: &quot;I know the acting was slightly over-the-top, but you know, the more we played &quot;RE1&quot;, the more the voices seemed to harmonize with everything the gameplay offered&quot;. He was also surprised at the character&#x27;s popularity among fans, commenting that it was &quot;a wonderful experience&quot; to voice him. 

Peter Jessop voiced the character in the 2002 remake of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and a recreational arcade game released solely in Japan. Wesker was next voiced by Richard Waugh in &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot;. His performance of Wesker was influenced by George Sanders, particularly his role as Shere Khan in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. He wanted to give the character a &quot;precise and inhuman&quot; speech pattern by speaking with a &quot;military-type&quot; tone and never using contractions. He reprised his role in &quot;Wesker″s Report&quot;, a fictional documentary detailing Wesker&#x27;s backstory, as well as &quot;Resident Evil Zero&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;. He also provided voice recordings in &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles&quot;, but they were replaced by D. C. Douglas&#x27;s recordings before launch. 

Douglas then voiced Wesker in &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil Zero HD Remaster&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil: Revelations 2&quot;, &quot;Umbrella Corps&quot;, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds&quot;, and &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot;. 

Ken Lally provided a motion capture for Wesker in &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;. In the 2023 remake of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, he was voiced and motion captured by Craig Burnatowski. Eric Pirius portrayed Wesker in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; live-action cutscenes. In &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;, Jason O&#x27;Mara portrayed Wesker, and Shawn Roberts portrayed him in &quot;Resident Evil: Afterlife&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot;, and &quot;Resident Evil: The Final Chapter&quot;. Tom Hopper portrayed Wesker in &quot;Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City&quot;. He explained that the filmmakers did not want Wesker &quot;to be a stereotypical villain, we wanted him to be likable. We&#x27;re seeing who he really is underneath the sunglasses.&quot; 

In the 2022 &quot;Resident Evil&quot; Netflix series, Lance Reddick portrayed the character; he was the first person of color to do so. The series&#x27; showrunners did not want to limit themselves to actors who resembled Wesker&#x27;s in-game appearance; showrunner Andrew Dabb stated that &quot;you&#x27;re making the show weaker by going with someone that may be more aesthetically a match to the game.&quot; Reddick did not know that the character was from a video game series, stating: &quot;When I was doing it, I didn&#x27;t think of having to play an already established iconic character, I just kept trying to bring what was on the page to life&quot;. He further said, &quot;This Wesker, although very very much based on the Wesker in the games, isn&#x27;t exactly him&quot;.

==Appearances==
===In the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series===
Every game in the series is set in the fictional American metropolitan area of Raccoon City until its destruction at the end of &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot;. Wesker&#x27;s presence was initially limited to cutscenes in the main &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games, where he manipulates the series&#x27; events from the background. He leverages his genius-level intellect to engineer mutagenic viruses to forcefully advance human evolution. Wesker&#x27;s backstory was largely left undeveloped until the release of &quot;The Wesker Report&quot;, a fictional documentary that details his virology research and role within the Umbrella Corporation. &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; reveals the Umbrella Corporation raised Wesker as part of a eugenics program, which offers him the best education but also indoctrinates him into developing misanthropic views and a superiority complex.

Wesker debuted in the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (1996), where he is the captain of the Special Tactics and Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.), a special forces police unit in Raccoon City. He initially helps the player by providing supplies and useful information. However, the protagonists learn Wesker is secretly working with the Umbrella Corporation to develop mutagenic viruses and bio-organic weapons (BOWs). Wesker is seemingly killed after releasing his latest BOW, the Tyrant, which unexpectedly impales him during the game&#x27;s finale. 

He returned to the franchise after a two-game hiatus in &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot; (2000) as the game&#x27;s secondary antagonist. He survives his apparent death due to an experimental virus that not only resurrected him after suffering grievous injuries but also endowed him with enhanced strength, speed, and agility. Wesker, now working for an unnamed rival to the Umbrella Corporation, conducts a raid on a secret research facility in Antarctica. He is defeated by Chris Redfield, who arrives at the facility while searching for his missing sister, Claire. Wesker makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; (2005), where he is revealed to be working with Ada Wong to obtain a specimen sample for further BOW research. 

He is the central antagonist in &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; (2009), where he conspires to release the Uroboros virus across the world and trigger an extinction event. He appears in-game as a nigh-invincible boss during the game&#x27;s penultimate battle, in which he effortlessly dodges and parries most of the player&#x27;s attacks. Chris and his partner Sheva ultimately halt his plans and kill Wesker in an active volcano at the end of the game. Despite his demise, his plans continue to drive the plot of the series, as his viral and BOW research causes many of the disasters and outbreaks in the subsequent games. The producer of the series has acknowledged that Wesker is indeed dead in the mainline video games.

===Other appearances===
Wesker appears in several of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; live-action film series. His character was adapted for the 2007 live-action film &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;. This version of Wesker is the head of the Umbrella Corporation, unlike Wesker&#x27;s role in the games as a renegade high-ranking Umbrella researcher. He runs Umbrella&#x27;s operations from behind the scenes, holding meetings via hologram with his underground board of directors in Tokyo. Originally, Wesker&#x27;s character was not intended to be in the film, with his role and lines in the script being given to Commander Okamoto. He reappears in 2010&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil: Afterlife&quot; as the main antagonist of the film. He later appears in &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot; (2012) as a defector from Umbrella, who sends Ada to rescue Alice from an underground Russian Umbrella outpost run by the Red Queen, who has taken over the rest of Umbrella. Wesker returns in the sixth film, &quot;Resident Evil: The Final Chapter&quot; (2016), where he betrays Alice. She then tracks him down to the Hive and kills him. His death triggers a dead man&#x27;s switch, which destroys the Hive and everyone within, including Alicia Marcus, the Umbrella High Command, and thousands of others held in stasis. In the reboot film &quot;Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City&quot; (2021), he is portrayed as a more sympathetic police officer for the Raccoon Police Department and serves as a secondary antagonist. Notwithstanding his appearance in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; Netflix series (2022), which delves into his backstory and personal experiments with human cloning.

Wesker is a playable character in several non-canonical &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games. He features in numerous &quot;Resident Evil&quot; mobile games. He appears in two games in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; franchise and in the asymmetrical survival horror game &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot; (2016). He also makes a cameo appearance as an unlockable alternate skin in &quot;Lost Planet 2&quot; (2010), &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; (2016) for Urien as an alternate skin, as a spirit in the Nintendo crossover video game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; (2018), in the digital collectible card game &quot;Teppen&quot; (2019), and &quot;Astro Bot&quot; (2024).

Wesker features in novelizations of the first game and &quot;Code: Veronica&quot;. In the former, titled &quot;The Umbrella Conspiracy&quot;, Wesker is attacked by multiple Chimeras and fatally wounded; he manages to awaken the Tyrant, which kills him. Several comic books based on the games were released, and he is a character in Bandai&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil Deck Building Card Game&quot; (2011). Merchandise featuring Wesker includes action figures and gun replicas.

==Reception==

Game publications have described Wesker as one of the best and most memorable villains in video game history. In 2013, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; named Wesker among the 50 greatest video game villains of all time. Kazuma Hashimoto of &quot;Polygon&quot; noted that the character&#x27;s light skin and blonde hair design evoke the aesthetic of the Nazi ideal of Übermensch, reflecting the series&#x27; &quot;core&quot; theme of eugenics. He noted that Wesker&#x27;s monologue in &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; fully illustrated the visual metaphor and stand-in Wesker embodies, drawing on standard social Darwinist talking points from Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s Übermensch theory. Together with other themes from the series, Wesker&#x27;s monologue creates a sense of terror that transcends the visual into something genuinely unsettling and intensely political. Kat Bailey of &quot;VG247&quot; stated that Wesker is the perfect horror game villain. She said, &quot;With his trenchcoat and omnipresent sunglasses hiding red, reptilian eyes, Wesker is the overarching antagonist through much of the series&quot;. Ryan Davis of &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that the voice acting of Wesker &quot;is a better fit&quot;, and he is entertaining while serving as the narrator of &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles&quot;. Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; discussed his appearances across the franchise and also said that &quot;even if the games start over from square one, we highly doubt Wesker will be left out of the party. After all, the best bad guys are the ones that wear shades.&quot; Rich Stanton of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; said that &quot;Chris and Wesker&#x27;s final showdown is both a terrible boss fight and unforgettable, because despite the faults it showcases a certain mindset about what an ultimate action climax should be.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; staff described him among the &quot;best characters in the three decades of Capcom&#x27;s history&quot; and wrote, &quot;Even after his death in &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;, Albert Wesker shows no signs of stopping, which is just the way we like it.&quot; Matt Cundy of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; praised Wesker&#x27;s death scene in &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;, as it showed the character&#x27;s strength. Brandon Trush of &quot;Bloody Disgusting&quot; and Luke McKinney of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; both echoed a similar sentiment and regarded Weskers&#x27; death scene as one of the most outstanding and over-the-top moments of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series. Conversely, Shubhankar Parijat of &quot;GamingBolt&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Resident Evil&quot; hasn&#x27;t had an overbearing villainous presence since Wesker died&quot;, but noted that &quot;his arc was wrapped up very well, and bringing him back might not be the best idea.&quot; 

The character has also received negative critical reviews. Ron Whitaker of &quot;The Escapist&quot; described Wesker as one of the terrible video game villains; he said that he always finds Wesker &quot;kind of a joke of a villain.&quot; He further said that it became worse in &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; when he shows up &quot;looking like he just failed a casting call for a character from &quot;The Matrix&quot;.&quot; Obi Anyanwu of &quot;Complex&quot; described him as the &quot;second-douchiest&quot; video game character, stating that &quot;Wesker has a following, yes, but there&#x27;s something very Agent Smith, a villain in &quot;The Matrix&quot;, about him that makes us shake our heads.&quot; Marshall Lemon of &quot;The Escapist&quot; also compared Wesker to Agent Smith, noting both villains&#x27; creators illogically enhanced their characters&#x27; power in subsequent installments, which diminished the narrative&#x27;s coherence. Lemon stated that the amount of varied roles Wesker played in association with his constant reappearances was cited by Lemon as devaluing his influence and effectiveness overall. Andy Kelly of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; commented that Wesker lacked the depth of a complex villain and instead embodied the over-the-top antagonist trope, surmising the character as &quot;a comically evil asshole who can do cool &quot;Matrix&quot; moves and transform into a monster.&quot; Ben Yahtzee Croshaw of &quot;The Escapist&quot; said that he cannot stand with Wesker and described him as &quot;emotionless shithead&quot;, &quot;grating&quot;, and &quot;boring cunt.&quot; Andy Kelly of &quot;PlayStation Official Magazine&quot; described the battle with Wesker in &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; as one of the worst boss fights in a PlayStation 3 game. John Friscia of &quot;The Escapist&quot; said that the final boss fight against Wesker was a &quot;pisstake for the ages.&quot; He felt that the boss fight was not difficult but basic, though he said that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t crack it.&quot; Bob Mackey of &quot;1UP.com&quot; has called him one of the least scary things in &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, suggesting that &quot;[t]o accentuate his alleged nefariousness, we suggest that Wesker grow a zombie mustache — &quot;that twirls itself.&quot;&quot; 

There was also commentary on Wesker&#x27;s film persona. Lance Reddick&#x27;s portrayal of Wesker in the 2022 &quot;Resident Evil&quot; Netflix series was lauded by critics. Zosha Millman of &quot;Polygon&quot; described his performance as the &quot;perfect balance of menacing and mannered.&quot; Charles Pulliam-Moore of &quot;The Verge&quot; offered a mixed review of the series but cited Wesker as the show&#x27;s best character, which they attributed to Reddick&#x27;s &quot;steely, menacing energy&quot;. Taylor Lyes of &quot;IGN&quot; noted that the Netflix series&#x27; portrayal and characterization of Wesker diverged from his video game counterpart, but commended the character&#x27;s revised backstory and story arc. However, Shawn Roberts&#x27; performance as Wesker in &quot;Resident Evil: Afterlife&quot; was criticized by Jim Vejvoda of &quot;IGN&quot;, who wrote that his portrayal of the character is &quot;one-dimensionally evil and over-the-top&quot;, which he attributed to poorly developed writing. Cory Wells of &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot; criticized Tom Hopper&#x27;s portrayal as Wesker in &quot;Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City&quot; and said &quot;Wesker lacks his monotone, conniving demeanor that&#x27;s matched in the games&quot; and &quot;doesn&#x27;t exude cocky confidence in the game series, but does [in the film].&quot;

<text>The Sint Maarten national football team is the football team of Sint Maarten, the Dutch half of the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, and is controlled by the Sint Maarten Football Federation. Sint Maarten is not a member of FIFA, and therefore not eligible to enter the World Cup. However, the association applied for FIFA membership in 2016 but was rejected. In April 2022, the Sint Maarten Football Federation appealed to the CAS against FIFA’s ruling.

In 2002, the Sint Maarten Soccer Association was given associate membership in CONCACAF and became full members at the XXVIII Ordinary Congress in April 2013 after becoming an independent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands after the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved in 2010. They are also members of the Caribbean Football Union and first took part in the Caribbean Cup in its inaugural edition in 1989.

==History==
From 1992 to 2016, the team had played approximately only 25 official matches. Between 2000 and 2016, only one match had been played, an unofficial 2–2 draw at home to Sint Eustatius on 20 August 2004. In 2012, SMSA President Owen Nickie stated that the national team&#x27;s inactivity was due to a lack of needed improvements on their home stadium. He indicated that not having enough players to choose from had also prevented the team from competing in the past but that they had more than enough players at that time. At that time, the association discussed hosting the Leeward Islands Tournament and participating in 2012 Caribbean Cup qualification as two of its objectives for the year. Nickie described not entering a team in the Caribbean Cup in the past as &quot;unfortunate&quot;. In August 2014, Sint Maarten was set to co-host the Leeward Islands Tournament which had been dormant at that time for over ten years. However, the tournament was postponed after Sint Maarten withdrew as host because of difficulties with the newly installed lights at the Raoul Illidge Sports Complex and Anguilla, the other host, withdrew for unspecified reasons. One report also indicated that the hosts withdrew because of an &quot;inability to facilitate teams.&quot; In May 2015, a match was organized by the SMSA as a showcase for selecting a national team player pool. It was open to all players with a Dutch passport. Although Sint Maarten&#x27;s senior team was dormant, a youth selection participated in the inaugural CONCACAF Under-15 Championship in August 2013 and Sint Maarten co-hosted the 2015 CFU Boy&#x27;s Under-15 Championship after the 2015 CONCACAF Under-15 Championship was canceled by CONCACAF for unspecified reasons.

===2017 Caribbean Cup===
Sint Maarten returned to international football in 2016, entering 2017 Caribbean Cup qualification and being drawn into Group 2 along with Grenada and the US Virgin Islands with the first round matches taking place on 22 and 26 March 2016. Sint Maarten had been absent from senior CFU competition for nineteen years as they entered the tournament. In January 2016 it was announced that Sint Maarten&#x27;s squad for 2017 Caribbean Cup qualification would be composed solely of players from Flames United SC, reigning champions from the 2014/2015 Senior league competitions and the champions of the 2012/2013 Excellence Division between the islands of Sint Maarten, Saint Martin and St. Barths. However, shortly thereafter it was reported that the previous report was inaccurate and that Flames United would actually be competing in the CFU Club Championship. Sint Maarten played its first senior men&#x27;s international in 12 years on 13 March 2016 as it hosted a 2–0 home victory against Anguilla as part of each side&#x27;s preparation for 2017 Caribbean Cup qualification. Both of Sint Maarten&#x27;s goals were scored by Joost Röben. In the first match of the tournament, Sint Maarten held Grenada to a scoreless draw in the first half which saw two of Sint Maarten&#x27;s starters sustain injuries. It was later revealed that Raymond Wolff had sustained a broken rib before coming off in the first half while fellow-Dutchman Rick De Punder was credited with an own goal. Grenada scored five goals in the second half to secure the 5–0 victory. Sint Maarten arrived on Grenada for the 8pm match at 4pm after the funds for the team airfare, paid for by the CFU, did not reach the airline in time and no seats were available. SMSA President Johnny Singh thought that the team would not be able to compete but another flight was arranged in time. The same scenario occurred for the return flight but the team was expected to be home on the Thursday prior to the team&#x27;s match against USVI on Saturday. Sint Maarten went on to lose the match to USVI 1–2, ending the team&#x27;s qualifying campaign. Sint Maarten&#x27;s only goal was scored by Ramsleii Boelijn.

==Stadium==
Sint Maarten plays its home matches at the Raoul Illidge Sports Complex in Philipsburg. The stadium has a capacity of 3,000 spectators. It is named after Raoul Illidge, a local philanthropist who laid the groundwork and covered many expenses in the planning of the stadium as part of his support for sport and culture on the island. Unsolicited, he contributed nearly ƒ800,000 for the project. After falling into disrepair, the complex was temporarily closed for renovation in July 2013. The two-part renovation included installation of a new running track, drainage system, and artificial turf, repainting of lighting poles and installation of new, brighter lights, in addition to a renovation of the complex&#x27;s buildings. The renovation costs were financed by the Dutch funding agency Usona and the Sint Maarten government. The international sports park was official reopened with a ribbon cutting ceremony by Prime Minister Sarah Wescot-Williams and Minister of Education, Culture, Youth and Sports Affairs Patricia Lourens-Phillip on 7 March 2014.

<text>Palm-wine music (known as maringa in Sierra Leone) is a West African musical genre. It evolved among the Kru people of Liberia and Sierra Leone, who used Portuguese guitars brought by sailors, combining local melodies and rhythms with Trinidadian calypso to create a &quot;light, easy, lilting style&quot;. It would initially work its way inland where it would adopt a more traditional style than what was played in coastal areas.

It would eventually gain popularity after Sierra Leone musician Ebenezer Calendar recorded songs in the 1950s and 1960s and continues to hold a small amount of that popularity.

== Etymology ==
Palm-wine music was named after a drink, palm wine, made from the naturally fermented sap of the oil palm, which was drunk at gatherings where early African guitarists played.

== History ==
This music was created from a fusion of local and foreign sailors, dock workers, and local working-class people who would go to palm-wine bars to drink and listen to music. Portable instruments and local string and percussion merged to create this style. It was out of this genre that the traditional two-finger plucking of a guitar came when musicians played it similarly to how they played the local lute or harp. This style was typically played in a syncopated 4/4 metre.

=== 1920s–1940s ===
In the 1920s, a Kru taught Ghanaian highlife guitarist Kwame Asare (or Jacob Sam). His Kumasi Trio made their first highlife recordings for Zonophone in London in 1928. As the music spread from the coast into the hinterland, the sound of the traditional Akan harp lute seperewa was infused and this evolved into the odonson or Akan blues and was called the &quot;Native Blues&quot;. His Master&#x27;s Voice and Parlophone Records distributed albums of the Akan blues in southern Ghana. This was in the 1930s and 1940s and featured artists like Jacob Sam, Kwesi Pepera, Appianing, Kwame, Mireku, Osei Bonsu, Kwesi Menu, Kamkan and Appiah Adjekum. At its peak of popularity in the 1930s, there would be about 200,000 Native Blues records sold per year before production was stopped due to World War II.

=== 1950s–1960s ===
Palm-wine music was first popularized by Sierra Leone Creole musician Ebenezer Calendar &amp; His Maringa Band, who recorded many popular songs in the 1950s and early 1960s. Soukous and highlife were influenced by palm-wine music. Though still somewhat popular, the genre is no longer as renowned as it once was. Other renowned palm-wine musicians include Koo Nimo (a.k.a. Daniel Amponsah), S. E. Rogie, Abdul Tee-Jay and Super Combo.

Agya Koo Nimo is another renowned Ghanaian singer who is popularly referred to as the &quot;King of Palm-wine music&quot;. The &quot;Grandfather of Highlife&quot;, as he&#x27;s often called, uses his music to tell life stories which has greatly influenced the Ghanaian and other West African music scenes. He was awarded the lifetime achievers award at the University of Education Winneba in Ghana.

<text>The Nokia 3210 is a GSM cellular phone, announced by Nokia on 18 March 1999.

== History ==

The 3210 was designed by Alastair Curtis in Nokia&#x27;s Los Angeles Design Center. The development was led by Frank Nuovo, who had designed the sleek and curvy Nokia 8110 in 1996. The team wanted to create an &quot;expressive&quot; and personalisable handset beyond the usual business-oriented mobile phone market, inspired by the Casio G-Shock and Sony Walkman designs. The phone thus became highly influential.

== Design ==
The Nokia 3210 has a total weight of 151 g. The handset measures 123.8 × 50.5 × 22.5 mm and features customisable fascias which clip on. It was thinner than previous Nokia models.

It was the first mass market phone with an internal antenna, after the feature had been introduced by Nokia on the luxury phone Nokia 8810 in 1998.

Three games came preinstalled: Snake, Memory (pairs-memory game) and Rotation. The addition of such games encouraged high sales within a youth market which was enlarging at a very fast rate. Some versions of the 3210 included the &quot;hidden&quot; games React and Logic. They were activated by special software using a data cable.

The 3210 was the first device that came preloaded with Nokia&#x27;s Composer software, which allowed users to manually &#x27;compose&#x27; monotone ringtones. It was possible to send the ringtones to another Nokia phone.

Picture messages sent via the SMS texting service were implemented in the handset, allowing users to send preinstalled pictures to one another. These included a &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; picture amongst others.

The handset was competitively priced and aimed specifically at teenagers and young professionals. This was at a time when few young people had access to a mobile phone, being generally identified with older professionals and business people.

The 3210 was originally designed with a vibrate alert function. Nokia decided not to implement this feature on some handsets within certain jurisdictions. A few months after its UK release, some mobile phone repair shops offered customers a handset upgrade to the vibrate function for a small fee.

== Handset specifications ==

* Standby time (h): 55–260
* Talk time (min): 180–270
* Charge time (h): 4
* Ringtone composer
* Dual band: Yes
* Vibrating alert (optional)
* Speed dialing
* 3 games: Yes note some models to like 3310
* Internal antenna
* Green backlight
* Interchangeable fascias

== Reception ==

A combination of cutting-edge features such as internal antennas and T9 text entry ensured the 3210 huge commercial success. Much of the phone&#x27;s success can also be attributed to an advertising campaign aimed predominantly at young people, a first in the mobile phone industry. The inclusion of 3 games, changeable &quot;Xpress-on&quot; covers (as on the previous Nokia 5110), an internal antenna, customisable ringtones and competitive prices led to the handset&#x27;s huge popularity with those aged 15–25.

With 160 million units sold, the 3210 is one of the most popular and successful phones in history. It is considered one of the most significant handsets Nokia ever developed.

== Revival ==
In 2024, HMD Global announced the revival version of Nokia 3210, with 4G, 2MP camera, IPS display, USB-C, running Series 30+ based on Mocor OS and featuring Cloud Phone technology support. Guardian journalist Zoe Wood documented her week with the new product during July 2024.

<doc id="1227948" wikidata="Q652112" url="?curid=1227948" title="Martin State Airport">
<text>Martin State Airport is a joint civil-military public use airport located east of the central business district of Baltimore, in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. The facility is located within the census-designated place of Middle River on Maryland State Highway 150 (Eastern Boulevard), near the intersection of Maryland State Highway 700 (Martin Boulevard). The Maryland Aviation Administration operates the airport on behalf of the Maryland Department of Transportation. MTN is a general aviation relief airport.

==History==
This was the former plant airport for the Glenn L. Martin Company which produced a large number of military aircraft at this location between the 1920s and 1960s. The Glenn L. Martin Maryland Aviation Museum and old seaplane ramps are located at the southeast corner of the airport.

In 1937, Glen Martin proposed height restrictions around the airport because a new generation of large, heavy transports would be flying from its seaplane base. By 1945, Martin had built $5.5 million in structures on the field. The company attempted to sell the property to the City of Baltimore for $1 million, but the commissioner Robert O&#x27;Boneell said there was insufficient room for expansion. In 1974, Governor Marvin Mandel proposed to purchase the airport from Martin Marietta. The company formed a real-estate arm, Chesapeake Park Inc., with the former Baltimore County Council Chair Herry J. Bartenfelder to build residential and commercial real estate. Citizens of Essex opposed the use conversion, lending support to the State&#x27;s purchase of the field for $9.4 million. In 1980, Port-A-Port T-Hangars were purchased for general aviation use and lease. In the 1990s the airport was targeted as part of the Middle River Employment Center district to have MD route 43 highway extended from I-95 direct to the terminal through a series of wetland parcels.

==Military use==
The Maryland Air National Guard&#x27;s 175th Wing is a tenant activity at MTN with locally based A-10C aircraft. The Air National Guard facility is located on the northeast side of the field and is officially named Warfield Air National Guard Base.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Martin State Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one asphalt paved runway designated 15/33 which is . It also had one helipad with a concrete surface.

For the 12-month period ending October 11, 2022, the airport had 87,130 aircraft operations, an average of 239 per day: 94% general aviation, 2% military, and 3% air taxi. At that time there were 241 aircraft based at this airport: 163 single-engine, 13 multi-engine, 19 jet, 21 helicopter, 1 glider, and 24 military.

== Operations ==
Martin State Airport serves a wide variety of general aviation and commercial operators. Martin State is home base to many helicopter operations including local news helicopters WJZ Channel 13 and WBAL Channel 11; Medevac services Express Care 1 and Helicopter Transport Services; and the aviation units for the Maryland State Police, Baltimore County Police, and the Baltimore City Police. It is also the home base for Grandview Aviation; a private jet charter company with services and bases all over North America.

There is a wide variety of flight training activities at the airport&#x27;s three flight schools: Middle River Aviation, First Class Flight Academy, and Brett Aviation.

<text>Samuel Mitchell VC (8 September 1841 – 16 March 1894) was a Royal Navy sailor and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Samuel Mitchell was born in Aspley in Bedfordshire, England, on 8 September 1841. His father was a labourer who later became a minister in a Wesleyan church. Mitchell joined the Royal Navy in 1857, shortly before his 16th birthday.

==Military career==
Mitchell served aboard HMS &quot;Crocodile&quot; and later the shore station in Portsmouth, . In 1860 he was posted to , which was destined for service on the Australian Station. Operating out of Sydney, the Australian Station area of operations encompassed both Australia and New Zealand.

In 1863, during the Waikato-Hauhau Maori War in New Zealand, the &quot;Harrier&quot; participated in an expedition up the Waikato River in support of British Army operations. Mitchell, who had been made captain of the foretop, was part of a naval brigade that was raised for service in the Invasion of the Waikato and which fought in the Battle of Rangiriri. By the end of the year, the fighting in the Waikato region had ceased but hostilities had shifted to Tauranga, and Mitchell&#x27;s brigade moved there to participate in the Tauranga Campaign.

On 29 April 1864, a storming party of 150 marines and sailors, which included Mitchell and the captain of the &quot;Harrier&quot;, Commander Edward Hay, together with soldiers of the 43rd Light Infantry, succeeded in establishing themselves inside a fortified position known as the Gate Pa. Hay was wounded and despite being ordered to seek safety, Mitchell carried his commander to shelter. Although Hay died soon after from his wounds, he requested that Mitchell be recognised for his actions. Hay&#x27;s senior officer, Commodore Sir William Wiseman, duly recommended him for the Victoria Cross (VC). The citation for his VC read:
Mitchell was presented with his VC by the Governor of New South Wales in a ceremony attended by over 9,000 people at The Domain in Sydney on 24 September 1864. It was the second presentation of the VC to take place in Australia, and the first in New South Wales. Promoted to boatswain&#x27;s mate, he continued to serve in the Royal Navy before ending his career in the military in mid-1865.

==Later life==
Mitchell returned to New Zealand and settled on the West Coast of the South Island, and worked on the gold fields there. He later purchased land near Ross and took up farming. He drowned on 16 March 1894 when attempting to cross the Mikonui River, which was in flood at the time. His body was recovered three days later. He was survived by his wife, Agnes, whom he married in 1870, and ten children. He is buried in Ross Cemetery.

==The medal==
Following his VC investiture, Mitchell&#x27;s medal was placed in storage along with other possessions in his sea chest, which he had left with the proprietors of the boarding house that he stayed in while in Sydney. He intended to have his belongings forwarded to him once he had settled in New Zealand but lost contact with the boarding house proprietors. His medal remained missing until around 1912, when it was purchased at an auction in London. His family attempted to negotiate with the owner of the medal for the return of the medal but it took the intervention of the Duke of York, before they were successful and it was purchased in 1928. His medal is now displayed in the Hokitika Museum in Hokitika.

<text>Siegfried Adolf Handloser (25 March 1885 – 3 July 1954) was a Nazi physician and convicted war criminal, convicted for overseeing medical atrocities at concentration camps. 

He was convicted at the 1947 Doctors&#x27; Trial during the subsequent Nuremberg trials and sentenced to life imprisonment. His sentence was ultimately reduced to a 20-year term, though Handloser was released in 1954 and died of cancer the same year. 

== Nazi Party membership ==
Born in Konstanz, he had been a member of the German Army Medical Service since the First World War.

Handloser joined the committee of the German Society for Internal Medicine (DGIM) in 1937 as a de facto Nazi emissary. In 1938, Handloser was promoted to the position of Army Group physician of the Nazi Army Group Command 3. In October, 1939, he was named honorary professor.

From February 1941 during World War II, he held the position of Chief of the Medical Services of the Wehrmacht, the most important medical position in the Nazi Armed Forces and Waffen-SS. He was also Doctor Professor of Medicine and Generaloberstabsarzt (Four stars, NATO Rank OF-9) of the German Armed Forces Medical Services.

=== War crimes ===
Handloser attended a meeting on December 29, 1941, at which it was decided to conduct human experiments to test typhus vaccines at Buchenwald concentration camp. They resulted in the deaths of about 100 people.

Handloser actively operated the organization of forced prostitution in the territories occupied by the German Reich, in his position as chief of Wehrmacht Medical Service. Handloser strove to minimize the danger of venereal disease and to prevent &quot;sexual intercourse with Jewish women.&quot;

== Conviction and death ==
He was convicted by the American Military Tribunal No. 1 (the Doctors&#x27; Trial) in August 1947, and sentenced to life imprisonment. This was later reduced to 20 years, but in 1954 he was released shortly before dying of cancer in Munich at the age of 69.

<text>Coulson Norman Mitchell (11 December 1889 – 17 November 1978) was a Canadian soldier. Mitchell was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==World War I==
Born in Winnipeg on December 11, 1889, Mitchell was a graduate of the University of Manitoba in civil engineering. With the outbreak of the First World War he enlisted as a private in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in 1914 and went overseas with a railway construction unit. He was commissioned in the field as a temporary lieutenant. While serving with the 1st Tunnelling Company of Canadian Engineers he was awarded the Military Cross in 1917.

===Victoria Cross===
Mitchell was 28 years old, and a captain in the 4th Engineer Battalion, Canadian Engineers, 2nd Canadian Division in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty on the night of 8–9 October 1918, at Canal de L&#x27;Escaut, north-east of Cambrai.

He led a small party ahead of the first wave of infantry in order to examine the various bridges on the line of approach and, if possible, to prevent their demolition.

On reaching the canal he found the bridge already blown up. Under a heavy barrage he crossed to the next bridge, where he cut a number of &quot;lead&quot; wires. Then in total darkness, and unaware of the position or strength of the enemy at the bridgehead, he dashed across the main bridge over the canal. This bridge was found to be heavily charged for demolition, and whilst Capt. Mitchell, assisted by his N.C.O., was cutting the wires, the enemy attempted to rush the bridge in order to blow the charges, whereupon he at once dashed to the assistance of his sentry, who had been wounded, killed three of the enemy, captured 12, and maintained the bridgehead until reinforced.

Then under heavy fire he continued his task of cutting wires and removing charges, which he well knew might at any moment have been fired by the enemy.

It was entirely due to his valour and decisive action that this important bridge across the canal was saved from destruction.

==World War II==
After the war, Mitchell returned to Winnipeg to practice civil engineering. Early in World War II, he was assigned to the Royal Canadian Engineers (RCE), at Camp Borden, Ont. In 1940, he went overseas and was put in charge of replacement training. Transferred back to Canada in 1943, he was attached to National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa before joining the staff of the RCE Training Centre at Petawawa, Ont. In 1944, he took command of the Royal Canadian School of Military Engineering in Chilliwack, B.C. He later achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

==Later life and memorials==

In 1946, Mitchell moved to Montreal where he joined an engineering firm in an executive capacity. In 1965, a Montreal branch of The Royal Canadian Legion was named after him. He died November 17, 1978, and was buried at the National Field of Honour in Pointe Claire, Quebec (Section M. Grave 3051).

The Canadian Military Engineers chose to honour Mitchell by naming the main building of the Canadian Forces School of Military Engineering at CFB Gagetown, New Brunswick, after him. His Victoria Cross is on display at the museum there.

A street in the town of Mount Royal is named after him. Mitchell Avenue, Mount Royal, Quebec. Coulson Mitchell Lake, named after him is located approximately 100 kilometres east of Thompson. The name of the lake is being modified to Norman Mitchell Lake at the request of the family to reflect that Lieutenant-colonel Mitchell was commonly referred to by the name &quot;Norman&quot;.

<text>Thomas Mottershead VC, DCM (17 January 1892 – 12 January 1917) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==

Thomas Mottershead was born in Widnes, Lancashire on 17 January 1892. He was the son of Thomas and Lucy Mottershead. He studied engineering at Widnes Technical School and was apprenticed as a fitter and turner after leaving school. In February 1914, he married Lilian Medlicott Bree and the couple had a son, Sydney, the following year. Mottershead was living at 31 Lilac Avenue in Widnes and working as a garage mechanic when World War I began. He enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps on 10 August 1914 as a mechanic, He was posted to the Central Flying school at Upavon and was promoted to Sergeant on 1 April 1916.

In May 1916 he began pilot training and 9 June of that year he obtained his Flying Certificate. He was posted to No.25 Squadron at St Omer, flying the FE 2, on 6 July 1916 and saw action in the Battle of the Somme.

==Distinguished Conduct Medal==
One of his first operations was low-level bombing raid on a German anti-aircraft battery which he successfully destroyed. On 22 September, with 2/Lt C. Street as observer he bombed the railway station at Samain, destroying one ammunition train and strafing another. While climbing away from the target, their aircraft was attacked by a Fokker scout. Accounts of the engagement indicate that it was Mottershead&#x27;s skillful manoeuvring which enabled Street to shoot the enemy aircraft down. For this action and other displays of gallantry, Sgt Mottershead was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal and promoted to the rank of Flight Sgt.

Undocumented accounts state that Mottershead and another No. 25 Squadron pilot landed on a German airfield, allowing their gunners to shoot up the hangars before taking off and escaping. The reputed date and location seem to remain unknown, but he was then transferred to No.20 Squadron at Clairmarais aerodrome.

==Victoria Cross==
On 7 January 1917 near Ploegsteert Wood, Belgium, Sergeant Mottershead was on patrol in FE-2d (serial number A39) with observer Lt. Willian Edward Gower when he was engaged in combat by two Albatros D.III of Jasta 8. Lt Gower managed to hit one and put it out of the action, the second Albatros however, flown by German &#x27;ace&#x27; &quot;Leutnant&quot; Walter Göttsch (20 victories), hit Mottershead&#x27;s aircraft, with the petrol tank pierced and the machine was set on fire. Enveloped in flames which his observer was unable to subdue with a handheld fire extinguisher, the Sergeant was badly burned but nevertheless managed to take his aircraft back to the Allied lines and made a successful forced landing. The undercarriage collapsed on touching the ground however, throwing the observer clear but pinning Mottershead in his cockpit. He was subsequently rescued but died of burns to his face, arms and thighs five days later in Number 8 Casualty Clearing Station, Bailleul.

Mottershead received the only V.C. ever awarded to a non-commissioned RFC officer during the First World War. The medal was presented to Mottershead&#x27;s widow Lilian by King George V in a ceremony in Hyde Park, London on 2 June 1917.

Lt Gower, 26, a pre-war railway engineering draughtsman from 62 Arthur Street, Derby, suffered severe facial burns and spent some eight-months recuperating prior to being transferred as an instructor to Palestine. He survived the war, and in May 1917 received the Military Cross from the King for his efforts to help Sgt Motterhead by spraying him with the aircraft&#x27;s fire extinguisher, despite being on fire himself. Lt Gower had joined the Army in 1914 and had served at the Battle of the Somme with the Sherwood Foresters as an infantry officer. He was Mentioned in Despatches.

{{quote|For most conspicuous bravery, endurance and skill, when attacked at an altitude of 9,000 feet; the petrol tank was pierced and the machine set on fire. Enveloped in flames, which his Observer, Lt. Gower was unable to subdue, this very gallant soldier succeeded in bringing his aeroplane back to our lines, and though he made a successful landing, the machine collapsed on touching the ground, pinning him beneath wreckage from which he was subsequently rescued. Though suffering extreme torture from burns, Sgt. Mottershead showed the most conspicuous presence of mind in the careful selection of a landing place, and his wonderful endurance and fortitude undoubtedly saved the life of his Observer. He has since succumbed to his injuries.}}
==Memorial Fund Concert==

On Wednesday, 11 April 1917 the Mayor of Widnes held a concert in the Premier Picture House for the &quot;Memorial Fund to the late Sergeant T. Mottershead V.C, D.C.M&quot;

The flyer for that concert included a &#x27;TRIBUTE TO &quot;A VERY GALLANT SOLDIER&quot;&#x27;, by Amanda Bebbington, also published in the &quot;Weekly News&quot; on 16 February 1917.

&lt;poem&gt;
TRIBUTE TO &quot;A VERY GALLANT SOLDIER&quot;

If I strove to tell this story as such story should be told,
I should write in jewel letters on a leaf of shining gold;
With a diamond pen to shrine each word as crystal as a tear,
And a blood-red fire of rubies to flash the record clear.

Oh! I cannot tell this story, for the flame is in my heart,
And my soul&#x27;s afire with a vision of the mighty hero-part;
And I spill the diamonds, in tears, that blind my mortal eyes
As I dream the horror of that flight through the unpitying skies.

Oh! A nation&#x27;s heart beats quicker with a proud exultant glow;
For such deeds as these can thrill her through her agony of woe.
And the England that doth render him her amplest meed of fame
Counts richest jewel in her crown her brave son&#x27;s honoured name.

I leave the story all untold - too feeble are my words.
The ocean&#x27;s diapason and the storm wind&#x27;s thundering chords,
The very stars that strew the heavens, the suns that ceaseless roll
Shall sing and blaze the brighter since they keep that hero-soul.

(Amanda Bebbington, in the &quot;Weekly News&quot;, 16 February 1917)
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Statue==

On 1 April 2018 a statue commemorating Mottershead was unveiled in Victoria Park, Widnes.

<text>Illinois Route 17 (IL 17) is a rural, arterial east–west state highway that runs east from a former ferry crossing in New Boston along the banks of the Mississippi River to State Road 2 west of Lowell, Indiana. It is long.

== Route description ==

Illinois 17 is the main street for numerous small towns in west central and central Illinois. It crosses the Illinois River at Lacon, and passes through Dwight and Kankakee, before it joins with Illinois Route 1 and enters Indiana east of Grant Park.

Illinois 17 also overlaps with U.S. Route 34, Illinois Route 251 (old U.S. Route 51), and Illinois Route 40 south of Wyoming. It also crosses the Kankakee River at Kankakee, IL. The route is largely a 2 lane road except through towns, where it occasionally becomes a 2 lane road with a center turn lane. East of Kankakee, Illinois 17 becomes a 4-lane divided highway.
At its western terminus, Illinois 17 is one of the only routes in the state not to connect to a state highway or U.S. Route of another state. A ferry crossing to Iowa had been dropped in the 1950s, but the terminus has not been moved east to reflect this. In 2003, the discovery that the Mississippi River had deepened at a nearby location raised the possibility of returning ferry service to New Boston. Ferry service in New Boston would be expected to bring 15,000 cars across the river yearly, saving the vehicles from driving to either Burlington, Iowa or Muscatine, Iowa — distances of about 50 miles (80 km) — to cross over into Iowa.

== History ==
SBI Route 17 originally ran from Lacon to Grant Park. The only changes to Route 17 have been extensions east and west, and a relocation to a new road south of Streator.

Illinois Route 83A connected Illinois Route 83 (now Illinois Route 17) to Keithsburg.

<doc id="1228004" wikidata="Q7327033" url="?curid=1228004" title="Richard Kelliher">
<text>Richard Kelliher, VC (1 September 1910 – 28 January 1963) was an Irish-born Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Kelliher received his VC while serving with the Second Australian Imperial Force in New Guinea during the Second World War.

==Early life==
Kelliher was born in Ballybeggan, Tralee, County Kerry in Ireland, then part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and emigrated to Queensland, Australia in 1929 with his sister Norah. Due to lack of work during the Great Depression his sister moved to Sydney while Kelliher became a swagman, working a variety of jobs.

==Military service==
Kelliher enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force on 21 February 1941, and was sent to the Middle East. He was assigned to the 2/25th Battalion, which was on garrison duty in Syria. The battalion returned to Australia in March 1942 and was sent to New Guinea, where it took part in the Battle of Buna–Gona later that year. During this battle Kelliher was arrested after allegedly running from the front. He was later court martialled for cowardice in the face of the enemy where he claimed his platoon commander had sent him back for information. The commander had been killed in the battle and Kelliher had no witnesses to his version. He was convicted, but the charge was soon after quashed and, after rejoining his unit, Kelliher stated he would prove he was no coward.

On 13 September 1943, during the Battle of Lae, the platoon to which Private Kelliher was attached came under very heavy fire from a concealed Japanese machine gun, at Heath&#x27;s Plantation. The machine gun inflicted severe casualties and prevented the platoon&#x27;s advance. Private Kelliher suddenly, on his own initiative, dashed towards the post and hurled two grenades at it, which killed some of the enemy. He returned to his section, seized a Bren gun, dashed back to the enemy post and silenced it. He then asked permission to go out again to rescue his wounded section leader, which he accomplished successfully under heavy fire from another enemy position.

Kelliher had bad health after suffering from both typhoid and meningitis before the war. In 1944 he was declared medically unfit for active service and discharged.

==Later life==
He later travelled to London to take part in the London Victory Parade of 1946. He married in 1949 and had three children. While working as a cleaner at Brisbane City Hall he applied for, but failed to get, a taxi driver&#x27;s licence and the family moved to Melbourne where he got a job as a gardener.

By the late 1950s Kelliher was completely disabled due to ill health and on 16 January 1963 had a stroke. He died in Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital on 28 January. In 1966, Kelliher&#x27;s battalion association bought his VC for AU$2,000 (equivalent to AU$27,400 in 2021) and donated it to the Australian War Memorial, where it is on display.

<text>Major William Thomas Forshaw VC (20 April 1890 – 26 May 1943) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

Forshaw was born 20 April 1890 in Barrow-in-Furness. In civilian life Forshaw was a teacher and was teaching at the North Manchester School, a prep school for The Manchester Grammar School, immediately before the outbreak of the First World War.

==Military career==

When he was 25 years old, and a Lieutenant (temporary Captain) in the 1/9th Battalion, Manchester Regiment, Territorial Force during the First World War, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions between 7 and 9 August 1915 in Gallipoli, Turkey at the Battle of Krithia Vineyard. The London Gazette of 9 September 1915 reported

He later achieved the rank of Major.

He died on 26 May 1943 and was buried at Touchen End, Berkshire in an unmarked grave. For many years the grave was unmarked but a new stone was erected in 1994 though not on the exact site.

His Victoria Cross and other campaign medals are displayed at the Museum of the Manchester Regiment, Ashton-under-Lyne, England in the Forshaw Room.

<doc id="1228011" wikidata="Q412323" url="?curid=1228011" title="Rituximab">
<text>Rituximab, sold under the brand name Rituxan among others, is a monoclonal antibody medication used to treat certain autoimmune diseases and types of cancer. It is used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (in children and adults, but not recommended in elderly patients), rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, pemphigus vulgaris, myasthenia gravis and Epstein–Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcers. It is given by slow intravenous infusion (injected slowly through an IV line).
The most common side effects with intravenous infusions are reactions related to the infusion (such as fever, chills and shivering) while most common serious side effects are infusion reactions, infections and heart-related problems. Similar side effects are seen when it is injected under the skin, with the exception of reactions around the injections site (pain, swelling and rash), which occur more frequently with the skin injections.

Severe side effects include reactivation of hepatitis B in those previously infected, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and death. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the developing fetus or newborn baby.
Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the protein CD20, which is primarily found on the surface of immune system B cells. When it binds to this protein it triggers cell death.
Rituximab was approved for medical use in 1997. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Rituxan is co-marketed by Biogen and Genentech in the US, by Roche elsewhere except Japan, and co-marketed by Chugai Pharmaceuticals and Zenyaku Kogyo in Japan.

== Medical uses ==

Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeted against CD20, a surface antigen present on B cells. It acts by depleting normal as well as pathogenic B cells while sparing plasma cells and hematopoietic stem cells, which do not express the CD20 surface antigen.

In the United States, rituximab is indicated to treat:

# non-Hodgkin lymphoma
# chronic lymphocytic leukemia
# rheumatoid arthritis having inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitors
# vasculitides such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis
# moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris
# in combination with chemotherapy for children (≥ 6 months to &lt; 18 years) with previously untreated, advanced stage, CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL), Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL), or mature acute B-cell leukemia (B-AL).

In the European Union, rituximab is indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma (two types of non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, a blood cancer); chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, another blood cancer affecting white blood cells); severe rheumatoid arthritis (an inflammatory condition of the joints); two inflammatory conditions of blood vessels known as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA); moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune disease characterised by widespread blistering and erosion of the skin and mucous membranes (the linings of internal organs). &#x27;Autoimmune&#x27; means that the disease is caused by the immune system (the body&#x27;s natural defences) attacking the body&#x27;s own cells.

=== Blood cancers ===
Rituximab is used to treat cancers of the white blood system such as leukemias and lymphomas, including non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. This also includes Waldenström&#x27;s macroglobulinemia, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Rituximab in combination with hyaluronidase human, sold under the brand names Mabthera SC and Rituxan Hycela, is used to treat follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It is used in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to treat previously untreated and previously treated CD20-positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

=== Autoimmune diseases ===

Rituximab has been shown to be an effective rheumatoid arthritis treatment in three randomised controlled trials and is now licensed for use in refractory rheumatoid disease. In the United States, it has been FDA approved for use in combination with methotrexate for reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to one or more anti-TNF-alpha therapy. In the European Union, the license is slightly more restrictive: it is licensed for use in combination with methotrexate in patients with severe active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more anti-TNF therapy.

There is some evidence for efficacy, but not necessarily safety, in a range of other autoimmune diseases, and rituximab is widely used off-label to treat difficult cases of multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and autoimmune anemias. The most dangerous, although among the most rare, side effect is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy infection, which is usually fatal; however, only a very small number of cases have been recorded occurring in autoimmune diseases.

Other autoimmune diseases that have been treated with rituximab include autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Evans syndrome, vasculitis (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis), bullous skin disorders (for example, pemphigus, pemphigoid—with very encouraging results of approximately 85% rapid recovery in pemphigus, according to a 2006 study), type 1 diabetes mellitus, Sjögren syndrome, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and Devic&#x27;s disease(Anti-AQP4 disease, MOG antibody disease), Graves&#x27; ophthalmopathy, autoimmune pancreatitis, Opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (OMS), and IgG4-related disease. There is some evidence that it is ineffective in treating IgA-mediated autoimmune diseases.

== Adverse events ==

Serious adverse events, which can cause death and disability, include:

* Severe infusion reaction
* Cardiac arrest
* Cytokine release syndrome
* Tumor lysis syndrome, causing acute kidney injury
* Infections
** Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy caused by JC virus reactivation
**Hepatitis B reactivation
** Other viral infections
* Immune toxicity, with depletion of B cells in 70% to 80% of lymphoma patients
* Pulmonary toxicity
* Bowel obstruction and perforation
A concern with continuous rituximab treatment is the difficulty to induce a proper vaccine response. This was brought into focus during the COVID-19 pandemic, where persons with multiple sclerosis and rituximab treatment had higher risk of severe COVID-19. In persons previously treated with rituximab for multiple sclerosis, nine of ten patients who delayed re-dosing until B cell counts passed 40/μL developed protective levels of antibodies after vaccination with the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

== Mechanisms of action ==


The antibody binds to the cell surface protein CD20. CD20 is widely expressed on B cells, from early pre-B cells to later in differentiation, but it is absent on terminally differentiated plasma cells. Although the function of CD20 is unknown, it may play a role in Ca2+ influx across plasma membranes, maintaining intracellular Ca2+ concentration and allowing activation of B cells.

Rituximab is relatively ineffective in elimination of cells with low CD20 cell-surface levels. It tends to stick to one side of B cells, where CD20 is, forming a cap and drawing proteins over to that side. The presence of the cap changes the effectiveness of natural killer (NK) cells in destroying these B cells. When an NK cell latched onto the cap, it had an 80% success rate at killing the cell. In contrast, when the B cell lacked this asymmetric protein cluster, it was killed only 40% of the time.

The following effects have been found:

* The Fc portion of rituximab mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).
* Rituximab has a general regulatory effect on the cell cycle.
* Preferential elimination of malignant B cells with high CD20 levels and high BCR signaling propensity, especially in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
* It increases MHC II and adhesion molecules LFA-1 and LFA-3 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen).
* It elicits shedding of CD23.
* It downregulates the B cell receptor.
* It induces apoptosis of CD20+ cells.
* Rituximab also induces a release of some chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells from immune niches, which might make them more sensitive to chemotherapy used in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody.

The combined effect results in the elimination of B cells (including the cancerous ones) from the body, allowing a new population of healthy B cells to develop from lymphoid stem cells.

Rituximab binds to amino acids 170–173 and 182–185 on CD20, which are physically close to each other as a result of a disulfide bond between amino acids 167 and 183.

== History ==
Rituximab was developed by IDEC Pharmaceuticals under the name IDEC-C2B8. The US patent for the drug was issued in 1998 and expired in 2015.

Based on its safety and effectiveness in clinical trials, rituximab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 to treat B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas resistant to other chemotherapy regimens. Rituximab, in combination with CHOP chemotherapy, is superior to CHOP alone in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and many other B-cell lymphomas. In 2010, it was authorized by the European Commission for maintenance treatment after initial treatment of follicular lymphoma.

It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

Originally available for intravenous injection (e.g. over 2.5 hrs), in 2016, it gained EU approval in a formulation for subcutaneous injection for B-cell CLL/lymphoma (CLL).

In June 2017, the US FDA granted regular approval to the combination of rituximab and hyaluronidase human (brand name Rituxan Hycela) for adults with follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The combination is not indicated for the treatment of non-malignant conditions. The combination was approved based on clinical studies SABRINA/NCT01200758 and MabEase/NCT01649856.

In September 2019, the US FDA approved rituximab injection to treat granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis in children two years of age and older in combination with glucocorticoids (steroid hormones). It is the first approved treatment for children with these rare vasculitis diseases, in which a person&#x27;s small blood vessels become inflamed, reducing the amount of blood that can flow through them. This can cause serious problems and damage to organs, most notably the lungs and the kidneys. It also can impact the sinuses and skin. Rituximab was approved by the FDA to treat adults with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis in 2011.

In December 2021, the US FDA approved rituximab in combination with chemotherapy for children aged 6 months to 18 years with previously untreated, advanced stage, CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, Burkitt-like lymphoma, or mature B-cell acute leukemia. Efficacy was evaluated in Inter-B-NHL Ritux 2010, a global multicenter, open-label, randomized 1:1 trial of participants six months in age or older with previously untreated, advanced stage, CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, Burkitt-like lymphoma, or B-cell acute leukemia. Advanced stage was defined as stage III with elevated lactose dehydrogenase level (lactose dehydrogenase greater than twice the institutional upper limit of normal values) or stage IV B-cell non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma or B-cell acute leukemia. Participants were randomized to Lymphome Malin B chemotherapy that consisted of corticosteroids, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate, cytarabine, doxorubicin, etoposide, and triple drug (methotrexate/cytarabine/corticosteroid) intrathecal therapy alone or in combination with rituximab or non-US licensed rituximab, administered as six infusions of rituximab IV at a dose of 375 mg/m2 as per the Lymphome Malin B scheme.

== Society and culture ==

=== Legal status ===
Rituximab was approved for medical use in the United States in November 1997.

==== Biosimilars ====
Biosimilars are approved in the United States, India, the European Union, Switzerland, Japan, and Australia. The US FDA approved rituximab-abbs (Truxima) in 2018, rituximab-pvvr (Ruxience) in 2019, and rituximab-arrx (Riabni) in 2020.

In July 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency recommended marketing authorization for the rituximab biosimilar Ituxredi produced by Dr. Reddy&#x27;s Laboratories / Holding GmbH. Itixredi is intended for the treatment of non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis and pemphigus vulgaris. Ituxredi was authorized for medical use in the European Union in September 2024. A Rituximab biosimilar Reditux was approved in India in 2007.

=== Economics ===
In 2014, Genentech reclassified Rituxan as a specialty drug, a class of drugs that are only available through specialty distributors in the US. Because wholesalers discounts and rebates no longer apply, hospitals would pay more.

Patents on rituximab have expired in the European Union and in the United States. Biosimilars were approved in the United States, India, the European Union, Switzerland, Japan, and Australia. The US FDA approved rituximab-abbs (Truxima) in 2018, rituximab-pvvr (Ruxience) in 2019, and rituximab-arrx (Riabni) in 2020. Truxima and Riabni are approximately $3600 per 500 mg, wholesale - 10% less than Rituxan, while Ruxience is 24% less than Rituxan. The Indian biosimilar &quot;ituxredi&quot; retails for about 1/6 the price.

==== Tailored-dosing ====
Tailored-dose rituximab is more cost-effective than fixed-dose. It is both more effective and less expensive.

==Research==
Rituximab has been reported as a possible cofactor in a chronic hepatitis E infection in a person with lymphoma. Hepatitis E infection is normally an acute infection, suggesting the drug in combination with lymphoma may have weakened the body&#x27;s immune response to the virus.

===Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome===
In 2009, a patient receiving methotrexate-induced B-cell depletion for cancer treatment, experienced a transient remittal of their myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) symptoms. While initial trials using Rituximab were promising, a phase 3 trial published in 2019 did not find an association between Rituximab treatment and improvements in ME/CFS.

===Intrathecal===

For CNS diseases, rituximab could be administered intrathecally and this possibility is under study.

=== Other anti-CD20 monoclonals ===

The efficacy and success of rituximab has led to some other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies being developed:

* ocrelizumab, humanized (90%-95% human) B cell-depleting agent.
* ofatumumab (HuMax-CD20) a fully human B cell-depleting agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;titleGenmab.com / HuMax-CD20 (ofatumumab)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Third-generation anti-CD20s such as obinutuzumab have a glycoengineered Fc fragment (Fc) with enhanced binding to Fc gamma receptors, which increase ADCC (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity). This strategy for enhancing a monoclonal antibody&#x27;s ability to induce ADCC takes advantage of the fact that the displayed Fc glycan controls the antibody&#x27;s affinity for Fc receptors.

<text>Bikutsi is a musical genre from Cameroon. It developed from the traditional styles of the Beti, or Ewondo, people, who live around the city of Yaoundé. It was popular in the middle of the 20th century in West Africa. It is primarily dance music.

==Etymology==
The word &#x27;bikutsi&#x27; literally means &#x27;beat the earth&#x27; or &#x27;let&#x27;s beat the earth&#x27; (&quot;bi&quot;- indicates a plural, -&quot;kut&quot;- means &#x27;to beat&#x27; and -&quot;chi&quot; means &#x27;earth&#x27;.) The name indicates a dance that is accompanied by stomping the feet on the ground.

==Description==

Bikutsi is characterised by an intense rhythm (3+3, with a strong &quot;two&quot; feel), though it is occasionally  and its tempo is usually quarternote. it is played at all sorts of Beti gatherings, including parties, funerals and weddings.

Beti gatherings fall into two major categories:

* Ekang phase: the time when imaginary, mythological and spiritual issues are discussed
* Bikutsi phase: when real-life issues are discussed

A double sided harp with calabash amplification called the &quot;mvet&quot; is used during these ceremonies, by Beti storytellers, who are viewed as using the &quot;mvet&quot; as an instrument of God to educate the people. The Ekang phase is intensely musical, and usually lasts all night. There are poetic recitations accompanied by clapping and dancing, with interludes for improvised and sometimes obscene performances on the balafon (a type of xylophone). These interludes signal the shift to the bikutsi phase, which is much less strictly structured than Ekang. During bikutsi, women dance and sing along with the balafon, and lyrics focus on relationships, sexuality and the lives of famous people. These female choruses are an integral part of bikutsi, and their intense dancing and screams are characteristic of the genre. Traditional bikutsi was often ironic in its content, as many modern bikutsi songs still are.

In its modern form, bikutsi is very popular, and rivals makossa as the country&#x27;s most renowned style.

==History==

Popular bikutsi first appeared in the 1940s with the recording of Anne-Marie Nzié. Some twenty years later, the style was electrified with the addition of keyboards and guitars. The most popular performer of this period was Messi Me Nkonda Martin, frontman for Los Camaroes and known as &quot;the father of modern bikutsi music&quot;. In an effort to translate the sound and spirit of traditional bikutsi music to more modern terms, Messi incorporated the sound of a balafon into the electric guitar by linking together the guitar strings with lengths of cotton cord. Played in this way, the electric guitar sounded similar to the balafon. The music itself, then, was only slightly altered, while the image and outside perception of bikutsi music was changed enormously. Other bands during this time, such as Les Vétérans, were also popular.

International acclaim began in 1987 with the formation of Les Têtes Brûlées by Jean Marie Ahanda. The late guitarist of Les Têtes Brulées, Zanzibar, invented the trick of damping the strings of his guitar with a strip of foam rubber to produce the music&#x27;s characteristic balafon-like thunk. (The balafon is a marimba-like instrument that is widely used in African folk music.) More modern performers include Jimmy Mvondo Mvelé and Mbarga Soukous.

Present-day bikutsi as performed by artists like Lady Ponce, K-Tino, Racine Sagath and Natascha Bizo is sometimes regarded as controversial. It has been criticised for the perceived sexual content of its lyrics and dancing style. In this respect bikutsi resembles mapouka from Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, which is also considered indecent by many Africans. The main difference is that present day bikutsi is still often performed by female artists who use it as a means of self-expression in a traditionally male-dominated society.

Thus a singer like K-Tino, self-styled &quot;femme du peuple&quot; (&quot;woman of the people&quot;) sees herself as having an important part to play in the emancipation and liberation of the women of Cameroon.

Among the current crop of artists are Patou Bass and Ovasho Bens, the promoter of a dance and philosophy called &quot;zig zag&quot;. His first album is composed not only of Cameroonian traditional rhythms but also West Indian zouk and Jamaican-style reggae.

Bikutsi has influenced Western musicians such as Paul Simon on his 1990 album &quot;The Rhythm of the Saints&quot;.

<text>William Henry Johnston (21 December 1879 – 8 June 1915) was a British soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born 21 December 1879 in Leith, Edinburgh to Maj. William Johnston and Mary Johnston. Johnston was a captain in the 59th Field Company, Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army. He was 34 years old, on 14 September 1914 during the Race to the Sea at Missy, France, in the First World War, he performed an act of bravery for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

His citation read:
Johnston afterwards served with the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers at St Eloi in the Ypres Salient. Mining activity by the Royal Engineers began at St Eloi in early 1915. The Germans exploded mines under the area known as &quot;The Mound&quot; just south-east of St Eloi in March 1915 and in the ensuing fighting the British suffered some 500 casualties. A month later, on 14 April 1915, the Germans fired another mine producing a crater over in diameter. Much of the British tunnelling in this sector was done by the 177th and 172nd Tunnelling Company, the latter commanded in early 1915 by Captain William Henry Johnston VC. Johnston left 172nd Tunnelling Company in early May and was killed in action at Ypres on 8 June 1915. He eventually achieved the rank of major.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum, Chatham, Kent.

<doc id="1228021" wikidata="Q1375885" url="?curid=1228021" title="Cornelis Jacobus Langenhoven">
<text>Cornelis Jacobus Langenhoven (13 August 1873 – 15 July 1932), who published under his initials C.J. Langenhoven, was a South African poet who played a major role in the development of Afrikaans literature and cultural history. His poetry was one of the then young language&#x27;s foremost promoters. He is best known for writing the words for &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot;, which was used previously as the national anthem during apartheid. He was affectionately known as &quot;Sagmoedige Neelsie&quot; (Gentle Neelsie) or &quot;Kerneels&quot;. His childhood friend who helped him get into poetry was called Hans Conrodius van Zyl.

== Biography ==
Langenhoven was born at Hoeko, near Ladismith, in the then Cape Colony, and later moved to Oudtshoorn where he became its most famous resident. In 1897 he married the widow Lenie van Velden. They had one child, a daughter named Engela, who was born in 1901. By 1914 he became a member of parliament (first as member of The House of Assembly, and later as Senator) where he took to the next level the struggle to have Afrikaans officially recognised. He was also a founding member of the Afrikaans newspaper Die Burger, and a South African Freemason.

His most famous work is the former South African national anthem &quot;Die Stem&quot;, which he wrote in 1918. Parts of it have been incorporated into the current national anthem, used since the abolition of apartheid in the 1990s. To celebrate the centenary of his birth, in 1973 the South African Post Office issued a series of stamps (in 4-cent, 5-cent and 15-cent denominations).

Langenhoven&#x27;s writing career spanned almost every genre, from poetry to ghost and alien stories. He also translated several works into Afrikaans, amongst which was the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. He was instrumental in the movement for the acceptance of Afrikaans as a language, and for it to be taught as the first language in schools instead of Dutch. This culminated in the language officially being used in parliament in 1925, and by 1927 it was recognised as an official language of South Africa, together with English and Dutch, although it effectively replaced Dutch in general usage.

== Personality ==
Considered one of the most versatile writers in Afrikaans, he was a master of the short form of prose and is best remembered for his humorous and satirical works, illustrated by a nonsense-verse &quot;love poem&quot; he wrote for his dog. Langenhoven was well known for his sharp wit and gentle manner. He owned an imaginary elephant named &quot;Herrie&quot; (&quot;Harry&quot;) that appeared in many of his stories. He even carved its name onto a boulder next to the N12 highway near Meiringspoort (outside Oudtshoorn) in 1929. This boulder, known as &quot;Herrie&#x27;s Stone&quot; (&quot;Herrie se Klip&quot;, in Afrikaans), has been declared a provincial heritage site.

== Legacy ==
* The Stellenbosch University Student Center is named after him and is affectionately known as &quot;Die Neelsie&quot; (&quot;The Neelsie&quot;).
* South African filmmaker made a light-hearted comedic television series based on Langenhoven&#x27;s work in 1983, titled &quot;Sagmoedige Neelsie&quot;.
* To celebrate the centenary of his birth, the South African Post Office issued C.J. Langenhoven stamps in 1973.
* A suburb in the west of Bloemfontein called Langenhoven Park was named after him.
_In 1936, Langenhoven High School was named after him.
* Langenhoven is regarded as one of the most prolific and most versatile Afrikaans writers still today, his Collected Works comprising 16 volumes. He is also fondly remembered and referred to for his quirky personality.
* The place he and his family lived in, called the &quot;Arbeidsgenot&quot;, (meaning &quot;the pleasure of work&quot; or &quot;the joy of labour&quot;) has been turned into a house museum. They lived there from 1901 until 1950.
* Nelson Mandela recounts that in 1964 while in prison he read a book by Langenhoven called &quot;Shadows of Nazareth&quot; about the trial of Jesus Christ that deeply affected him. Mandela describes how in Langenhoven&#x27;s book Pilate agreed to judge Jesus, then offered the public a choice that freed not Jesus but the zealot Barabbas, and then how he, Pilate, finally ordered Jesus brought into the Roman court. &quot;He gazed upwards and his eyes seemed to pierce through the roof and to see right beyond the stars,&quot; wrote Langenhoven. &quot;It became clear that in that courtroom authority was not in me as a judge, but was down below in the dock where the prisoner was.&quot;

<text>The Cicones (; ) or Ciconians were a Homeric Thracian tribe, whose stronghold in the time of Odysseus was the town of Ismara (or &quot;Ismarus&quot;), located at the foot of mount Ismara, on the south coast of Thrace (in modern Greece). They are mentioned in book two of the &quot;Iliad&quot; as having joined the war on the side of the Trojans, led by Euphemus. In book nine of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Odysseus and his men take Ismara by surprise and slay most of the Ciconian men they come across, taking Ciconian women as slaves. Later Ciconian reinforcements arrive and attack the invading Achaeans, killing so many of them that Odysseus and his men are forced to flee in their ships. Six men of each of Odysseus&#x27; ships were killed:
When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, which is the city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the people to the sword. We took their wives and also much booty which we divided equitably amongst us, so that none might have reason to complain. I then said that we had better make off at once, but my men very foolishly would not obey me, so they stayed there drinking much wine and killing great numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the Cicons cried out for help to other Cicons who lived inland. These were more in number, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of war, for they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the occasion served; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as leaves and bloom in summer, and the hand of heaven was against us, so that we were hard pressed. They set the battle in array near the ships, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another. So long as the day waxed and it was still morning, we held our own against them, though they were more in number than we; but as the sun went down, towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Cicons got the better of us, and we lost half a dozen men from every ship we had; so we got away with those that were left&quot;.
The Cicones are also referred to in the book of poems &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by Ovid. They are mentioned in book VI when he writes of Boreas and Orithyia, when Ovid states:
He bore her off; and as he flew he felt the flames of love gain force on force; he did not curbe his course across the air until he&#x27;d reach the northern lands and city of the Cicones.
Orpheus, the Thracian lyre-player who sought his lover Eurydice in the underworld, was said to have been torn to pieces by Ciconian women after he rejected their advances, subsequently being reincarnated as a swan, or, according to Ovid, his disembodied head floating on the sea until it came to rest on the island of Lesbos, where it continued to speak, uttering prophecies.

In classical times and in a historical context they go into obscurity. Non mythical instances of them occur in Herodotus (5th century BC) as he writes of their land that Xerxes&#x27; army passed by. The tribe itself is thought to have disappeared early on.

Eumenes of Cardia lived there for a while after being retrieved from a sunk slave ship heading to Olbia, Ukraine.

<text>In the Royal Navy, a flag captain was the captain of an admiral&#x27;s flagship. During the 18th and 19th centuries, this ship might also have a &quot;captain of the fleet&quot;, who would be ranked between the admiral and the &quot;flag captain&quot; as the ship&#x27;s &quot;First Captain&quot;, with the &quot;flag captain&quot; as the ship&#x27;s &quot;Second Captain&quot;.

Unlike a &quot;captain of the fleet&quot;, a flag-captain was generally a fairly junior post-captain, as he had the admiral to keep an eye on him, but – like a &quot;captain of the fleet&quot; – a &quot;flag captain&quot; was a post rather than a rank.

<text>Francis Octavius Grenfell, VC (4 September 1880 – 24 May 1915) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross.

==Early life and family==
He was born on 4 September 1880 to Sophia and Pascoe Du Pré Grenfell. He was one of fifteen children. He had a twin brother, Riversdale Grenfell, also in the 9th Lancers, who was killed in action in September 1914. Their maternal grandfather was Admiral John Pascoe Grenfell and other relatives included their uncle, Field Marshal Francis Grenfell, 1st Baron Grenfell. An older brother, Lieutenant Robert Septimus Grenfell, 21st (Empress of India&#x27;s) Lancers, was killed in a cavalry charge during the Battle of Omdurman in 1898. Three other brothers, Cecil Grenfell, Howard Maxwell Grenfell and Arthur Morton Grenfell all reached the rank of lieutenant colonel in the British Army. A cousin, Lieutenant Claude George Grenfell (Thorneycroft&#x27;s Mounted Infantry) was killed at Spion Kop during the Boer War and two other cousins Julian Grenfell, the poet, and his brother, Gerald William Grenfell, were killed in the First World War.

An Etonian who represented his school at cricket, Grenfell joined the army in 1900 and first served in the Second Boer War in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps.

==Victoria Cross==

Grenfell was 33 years old, and a captain in the 9th (Queen&#x27;s Royal) Lancers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed during the action of Elouges took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 24 August 1914 at Audregnies, Belgium, Captain Grenfell rode with the regiment in a charge against a large body of unbroken German infantry. The casualties were very heavy and the captain was left as the senior officer. He was rallying part of the regiment behind a railway embankment when he was twice hit and severely wounded. In spite of his injuries, however, when asked for help in saving the guns, by Major Ernest Wright Alexander of the 119th Battery, Royal Field Artillery, he and some volunteers, under a hail of bullets, helped to manhandle and push the guns out of range of enemy fire. The citation was gazetted on 16 September 1914 and read:
He was killed in action on 24 May 1915 and is buried in the Vlamertinghe Military Cemetery.

==Legacy==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of the 9th/12th Royal Lancers housed in Derby Museum and Art Gallery, Derby, England.

== Polo ==
All nine of the Grenfell brothers were accomplished polo players. Francis and his twin brother, Riversdale Grenfell, were regarded as the best in the family. Francis was rated at an 8-goal handicap. The twin brothers were on the Ranelagh team that won the American Open and on the team Freebooters, alongside Leopold Christian Duncan Jenner and the Duke of Roxburghe, that won the Hurlingham Champion Cup.

<text>: &quot;For the Irish Campaign group Democracy Matters, see Democracy Matters (Ireland).&quot;

Democracy Matters is an American non-profit, non-partisan grassroots student political organization that is dedicated to deepening democracy. The organization&#x27;s mission is to strengthen democracy by: (1) training young people how to be effective grassroots organizers and advocates; and (2) supporting public financing of election campaigns (“fair elections”) and other pro-democracy and campaign finance related reforms. Democracy Matters believes that it is imperative to reduce the overwhelming influence of big private and corporate money in elections and necessary to empower ordinary people—regardless of race, gender, and/or socio-economic status—to be able to participate meaningfully in the electoral and political process. Democracy Matters is also a part of the Declaration for American Democracy coalition.
==Origins==
Wanting to give back after having been fortunate enough to play in the NBA, former 13-year veteran NBA player and Colgate alumnus Adonal Foyle, with the assistance of his adoptive parents Jay Mandle (professor of economics at Colgate) and Joan Mandle (associate professor of sociology, anthropology and women&#x27;s studies at Colgate), created Democracy Matters in 2001. Colgate University served as the test for the first Democracy Matters chapter, and after a successful first year, multiple other chapters were established across the country. Among the oldest chapters are those at Vassar College, Brown University, Syracuse University, and St. Lawrence University.

==Structure of organization==
Democracy Matters focuses on a bottom-up approach to political change. The organization seeks to empower and activate college students to lead the fight for campaign finance reform. Towards this end, Democracy Matters offers an internship program. When a student is selected as an intern, Democracy Matters offers individually-crafted training in political organizing, theory, and communication. Once students have undergone preliminary training, they sets forth to create (or maintain if already existence) a Democracy Matters chapter at their university. In this function, they oversee groups of other student activists committed to getting big money out of politics. Throughout its existence, Democracy Matters has worked with more than 800 interns and brought thousands of other affiliated students into the campaign finance fight.

Democracy Matters chapters are diverse in terms of race, gender, and political orientation. As such, there is no single programming curriculum for DM chapters. Students are encouraged to be creative and innovative with their campaigns and to develop their own style of political organizing. Among the many tactics used are: organizing movie screenings, bringing in well known lecturers, facilitating educational panels, and actively writing legislation and lobbying for reform on local and state levels. Students often partner with local community groups, statewide and national groups, and politicians to educate other citizens and actively promote legislation. Democracy Matters has also traditionally been geographically diverse, having had university chapters across the country.

==Raising awareness==
Democracy Matters members raise awareness and educate others on their campuses and in nearby communities by organizing campaigns that link the problems of the current campaign finance system to other important issues such as the environment, civil rights, foreign policy, and rising college tuition. Democracy Matters and its students aim to show that the issue of campaign finance is an interdisciplinary one, which impacts all people interested in social justice issues.

Democracy Matters&#x27; official position in terms of how to improve the US campaign finance system is through the creation of an opt-in public financing system for national and statewide campaigns. Public financing of election campaigns, similar to the successful state systems in Maine, Arizona and Connecticut also known as &quot;Voter/Citizen-Owned Elections&quot;, or &quot;Fair Elections&quot; provide an alternative for candidates to be publicly funded if they refuse to accept private donations from individuals or groups. This allows ordinary citizens, who lack the fiscal means, to run for office. Once elected, these publicly financed politicians are accountable to their constituents rather than to campaign contributors. Furthermore, they can use their time working on issues important to the people they represent rather than spending many hours each day on the phone &quot;dialing for dollars&quot; or attending fundraisers. In this respect, Democracy Matters has been very active in the fight for public financing of elections in New York state.

==Restore Democracy Fellowship==
In the summer of 2015, Democracy Matters started a new program entitled &quot;Restore Democracy&quot; focused on making campaign finance an issue in the 2016 presidential elections. The organization funded a handful of summer interns to travel to the first two primary states, Iowa and New Hampshire. These interns were tasked with attending presidential candidates&#x27; events to ask them questions about where they stood on the issue of public financing and campaign finance reform more broadly; building new chapters at large universities in the respective states to create pressure once the school year began; and creating coalitions with local leaders towards the end of building student-adult groups for reform. The organization also attempted to get presidential candidates to sign the &quot;Restore Democracy&quot; pledge card, which read &quot;I support restoring democracy by publicly financing elections and taking big money out of politics.”

During the course of this program, the group became the first organization to get Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on the record supporting public financing of elections. The organization also got Republican Donald Trump on record saying public financing of elections was &quot;fine&quot;. On August 3, Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, who had previously declared his support for public financing, recorded a video endorsing the work that Democracy Matters was doing and reiterated the need for campaign finance reform.

By summer&#x27;s end, Democracy Matters got both Bernie Sanders and Martin O&#x27;Malley to sign their &quot;Restore Democracy&quot; pledge. The fellowship program successfully established over a dozen chapters in both New Hampshire and Iowa.

==Publications==
Democracy Matters publishes two monthly columns. The first, eNews, highlights the organization&#x27;s most active student chapters and details recent events in the world of campaign finance. The second, Money on my Mind, written by Jay Mandle, links various political problems to big money in politics. Joan and Jay Mandle have also published a book, &quot;Change Elections, Change America&quot;, which chronicles the history of Democracy Matters and explains the pleasures and difficulties of running a non-profit political organization centered around social justice.

==Reception==
Since founding Democracy Matters, Foyle has received multiple awards for his commitment to lasting social change. The NBA recognized Foyle for his commitment to democracy with nationally televised presentations of their &quot;Community Assist Award&quot;. The Greenlining Institute presented him with their prestigious Change Agent Award for his commitment to campaign finance reform. Foyle also received the city of San Francisco&#x27;s Sports Hero Award as well as many other awards and commendations for his work increasing the civic engagement of young people.

Foyle&#x27;s commitment to Democracy Matters has also been widely hailed in the press, including in &quot;The New York Times, Sports Illustrated, USA Today, The Nation, Congressional Quarterly, Mother Jones, ESPN Magazine,&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Tribune Magazine&quot;, as well as in numerous local newspapers.

Foyle has since remained passionate about activating young people to be civically and politically engaged. In an op-ed piece, Foyle recounted the tremendous energy and creativity Democracy Matters students have brought to the work of deepening democracy.

<text>Baltimore Hebrew University was founded as Baltimore Hebrew College and Teachers Training School in 1919 to promote Jewish scholarship and academic excellence. It was the only institution of higher learning in Maryland devoted solely to all aspects of Judaic and Hebraic studies. Located in the northwest, Park Heights neighborhood of Baltimore, BHU conferred degrees up to the doctorate level. Though small in size, with classes having between 8 and 25 students, it had strong ties to the community and to several other local colleges and universities.

Baltimore Hebrew University merged with Towson University, officially becoming the Baltimore Hebrew Institute, in 2009. The entire BHU library is now housed at TU&#x27;s Albert S. Cook Library, including special collections of rare books, Yizkor books, a collection of items related to Jewish cultural reconstruction, and testimonies from survivors of the Holocaust. The BHU building on Park Heights Avenue was demolished in October 2009.

<text>Samuel Meekosha VC (16 September 1893 – 8 December 1950), who changed his name by deed poll to Samuel Ingham in 1942, was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Samuel Meekosha was born in Leeds, although his family moved to Bradford when he was a baby, and Samuel always looked on that city as his home.
Samuel&#x27;s mother was English and he had a Polish father; he was proud of his Eastern European roots but was such a reluctant hero that in later life he changed his surname to Ingham, from his mother&#x27;s maiden name of Cunningham.

He was 22 years old, and a corporal in the 1/6th Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own), British Army based at Belle Vue Barracks, Manningham, Bradford when during the First World War the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 19 November 1915 near the Yperlee Canal, near the village of Boesinghe (Boezinge), in Belgium, Corporal Meekosha was with a platoon of about 20 NCOs and men holding an isolated trench north of Ypres. During a very heavy bombardment six of the platoon were killed and seven wounded, while the rest were more or less buried. When there were no senior NCOs left in action Corporal Meekosha took command, sent for help and in spite of more big shells falling within 20 yards of him, continued to dig out the wounded and buried men in full view of and at close range from the enemy. He was assisted by Privates Johnson, Sayers and Wlkinson who were all awarded the DCM. Their courage saved at least four lives.

Meekosha was commissioned into the West Yorkshire Regiment in 1917. He was promoted lieutenant in 1918 and captain in 1919. He transferred to the Corps of Military Accountants in 1919, retiring in 1926. He rejoined the West Yorkshire Regiment as a captain in 1940 and transferred to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, based in Leicestershire, later the same year. He was later promoted to major.

It was reported in the 3 April 2001 issue of &quot;The Times&quot; that James Morton, Sotheby&#x27;s medal specialist, said: &quot;Meekosha was a very modest man who was quite dismissive of the act that earned him the VC. He joined up for the Second World War and because of his unusual name people kept asking him: &#x27;Aren&#x27;t you the chap that won the VC?&#x27; In an attempt to stop the questions he changed his name [to Ingham] by deed poll in 1941 or 1942.&quot;

After the First World War he became a representative for the tobacco company John Player &amp; Sons. He died at his home in Oakdale, Blackwood, Monmouthshire, on 8 December 1950. Cremated at Glyntaff Crematorium, Pontypridd, his ashes were claimed by his family and spread on Ilkley Moor in Yorkshire.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross was sold for £101,200 at Sotheby&#x27;s on 3 May 2001
