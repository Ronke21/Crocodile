<text>Harmony is the seventh album by American rock band Three Dog Night, released in 1971 (see 1971 in music). The album featured two Top 10 hits: &quot;An Old Fashioned Love Song&quot; (U.S. #4) and a cover version of Hoyt Axton&#x27;s &quot;Never Been to Spain&quot; (U.S. #5).

== Critical reception ==
Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;Next to Grand Funk, they&#x27;re the country&#x27;s top touring act, and they sell singles in the multiple millions besides. They&#x27;re slick as Wesson Oil. And when they choose the right material and go light on the minstrel-show theatrics, they&#x27;re fine—next to &#x27;Maggie May,&#x27; &#x27;Joy to the World&#x27; is the most durable single of the year. Their albums do vary—avoid the &#x27;Joy to the World&#x27; vehicle &quot;Naturally&quot;—but I think this is the best. Even if you&#x27;re hostile, you&#x27;ll have to concede that any group that can string together great-but-obscure songs from Marvin Gaye, Joni Mitchell, and Moby Grape without inspiring a rush back to the originals has something going for it. Wish they&#x27;d cut the poetry reading, though.&quot;

<doc id="1244519" wikidata="Q9172327" url="?curid=1244519" title="Battle of Andros (1696)">
<text>The battle of Andros took place on 22 August 1696 southeast of the Ottoman island of Andros between the fleets of the Republic of Venice and the Papal States under Bartolomeo Contarini on the one side, and the Ottoman Navy under Mezzo Morto Hüseyin Pasha as well as Barbary vassals on the other. The encounter was indecisive, and no vessels were lost on either side.

==Background==
Contarini, with 22 sailing ships, left Porto Poro on 28 July and arrived at Port Gavrion, on the west coast of Andros, on 3 August, while a galley force, under , went to Kekhrios, on mainland Greece, ready for an attack on Thebes.

On 6 August the Muslim fleet of 20 Ottoman and 15 African ships was sighted north of Andros. It sailed around to Gavrion and tried to tempt Contarini out, but the wind was from the north (possibly this should be south), and Contarini had orders not to engage unless he had the weather gauge, and even after the Ottomans sent galliots in and landed troops all he did was send a small craft to drive them off. The Ottomans left and anchored to the west. For ten days nothing happened, except for a French merchantman entering the harbor being fired on by the Venetians, who mistook it for a fireship.

== Battle ==
On 20 August the north wind dropped and at 5:00 pm the Ottoman fleet appeared again off the town and opened fire, with little result, before becoming becalmed to the south during the night. On 21 August the wind was from the north again and Contarini, seeing his chance, sailed, but the wind dropped at about 12:00 pm and he made for the southeast end of Andros with what wind there was, being joined there by the galley force that had just arrived from the west, early on 22 August. A slight easterly wind gave Contarini another chance and he sailed west, the galleys towing the sailing ships, toward the south end of the Ottomans, who were arranged vaguely in an easterly Ottoman line and a westerly African line but mainly in a group formation, and turned north, coming alongside them with his first seven ships (&quot;Tigre&quot;, &quot;Rosa&quot;, &quot;San Andrea&quot;, &quot;San Lorenzo Giustinian&quot; (flag), &quot;San Domenico&quot;, &quot;Fede Guerriera&quot; and &quot;San Sebastiano&quot;) and attacking at about 12:00 am. At about 2:00 pm the rowing vessels detached and formed a line abreast to the south of the Ottomans. Both sides&#x27; sailing ships formed themselves more or less into lines, and the Ottoman fleet gradually bore away. At 4:00 pm the wind dropped and the Venetian galleys, which had cut back through the line, then re-emerged and attacked the Ottomans in a line abreast. The Turks withdrew after about two hours, eventually making their way south to near the island of Syros, while the Venetians eventually sailed back to Port Gavrion. Until 1 December the Venetians sailed around looking for the Ottoman fleet, when they heard that it had sailed back into the Dardanelles almost a month earlier.

Christian casualties were 56 killed and 125 wounded in the sailing ships and about 19 casualties in the rowing vessels.

<doc id="1244521" wikidata="Q5558928" url="?curid=1244521" title="Gibborim (biblical)">
<text>Gibborim (, singular ) is a Hebrew word that can be glossed &quot;mightiest&quot; and is an intensive form of the word for &quot;man&quot; ( ). In the Hebrew Bible, it is used to describe people who are valiant, mighty, or of great stature. There is some confusion about the gibborim as a class of beings because of its use in the Genesis flood narrative in Genesis 6:4, which describes the Nephilim as mighty ().

The word is used in the Tanakh over 150 times and applied to men as well as lions (Proverbs 30:30), hunters (), soldiers () and leaders (Daniel 11:3). The word is also applied to David&#x27;s Mighty Warriors, a group of 37 men who fought with King David in 2 Samuel 23:8–38.

In Modern Hebrew, the word () equates with the English word &quot;hero&quot; as a noun or brave as an adjective.

== Modern Hebrew ==
In contemporary usage, gibborim is often used to describe heroes or champions. It is a term used to describe individuals who exhibit exceptional strength, courage, and prowess. The word is often associated with sports, where it is used to describe athletes who exhibit exceptional skill and ability.

<doc id="1244523" wikidata="Q17086396" url="?curid=1244523" title="Newton's method in optimization">
<text>In calculus, [[Newton&#x27;s method]] (also called Newton–Raphson) is an iterative method for finding the roots of a differentiable function formula_1, which are solutions to the equation formula_2. However, to optimize a twice-differentiable formula_1, our goal is to find the roots of formula_4. We can therefore use Newton&#x27;s method on its derivative formula_4 to find solutions to formula_6, also known as the critical points of formula_1. These solutions may be minima, maxima, or saddle points; see section &quot;Several variables&quot; in Critical point (mathematics) and also section &quot;Geometric interpretation&quot; in this article. This is relevant in optimization, which aims to find (global) minima of the function formula_1.

==Newton&#x27;s method==

The central problem of optimization is minimization of functions. Let us first consider the case of univariate functions, i.e., functions of a single real variable. We will later consider the more general and more practically useful multivariate case.

Given a twice differentiable function formula_9, we seek to solve the optimization problem
:formula_10

Newton&#x27;s method attempts to solve this problem by constructing a sequence formula_11 from an initial guess (starting point) formula_12 that converges towards a minimizer formula_13 of formula_1 by using a sequence of second-order Taylor approximations of formula_1 around the iterates. The second-order Taylor expansion of around formula_16 is

:formula_17

The next iterate formula_18 is defined so as to minimize this quadratic approximation in formula_19, and setting formula_20. If the second derivative is positive, the quadratic approximation is a convex function of formula_19, and its minimum can be found by setting the derivative to zero. Since

:formula_22
the minimum is achieved for
:formula_23
Putting everything together, Newton&#x27;s method performs the iteration
:formula_24

==Geometric interpretation==

The geometric interpretation of Newton&#x27;s method is that at each iteration, it amounts to the fitting of a parabola to the graph of formula_25 at the trial value formula_16, having the same slope and curvature as the graph at that point, and then proceeding to the maximum or minimum of that parabola (in higher dimensions, this may also be a saddle point), see below. Note that if formula_1 happens to {{em|be}} a quadratic function, then the exact extremum is found in one step.

==Higher dimensions==
The above iterative scheme can be generalized to formula_28 dimensions by replacing the derivative with the gradient (different authors use different notation for the gradient, including formula_29), and the reciprocal of the second derivative with the inverse of the Hessian matrix (different authors use different notation for the Hessian, including formula_30). One thus obtains the iterative scheme

:formula_31

Often Newton&#x27;s method is modified to include a small step size formula_32 instead of formula_33:
:formula_34
This is often done to ensure that the Wolfe conditions, or much simpler and efficient Armijo&#x27;s condition, are satisfied at each step of the method. For step sizes other than 1, the method is often referred to as the relaxed or damped Newton&#x27;s method.

==Convergence==

If {{math|&quot;f&quot;}} is a strongly convex function with Lipschitz Hessian, then provided that formula_35 is close enough to formula_36, the sequence formula_37 generated by Newton&#x27;s method will converge to the (necessarily unique) minimizer formula_13 of formula_39 quadratically fast. That is,
:formula_40

==Computing the Newton direction==

Finding the inverse of the Hessian in high dimensions to compute the Newton direction formula_41 can be an expensive operation. In such cases, instead of directly inverting the Hessian, it is better to calculate the vector formula_42 as the solution to the system of linear equations

:formula_43

which may be solved by various factorizations or approximately (but to great accuracy) using iterative methods. Many of these methods are only applicable to certain types of equations, for example the Cholesky factorization and conjugate gradient will only work if formula_44 is a positive definite matrix. While this may seem like a limitation, it is often a useful indicator of something gone wrong; for example if a minimization problem is being approached and formula_44 is not positive definite, then the iterations are converging to a saddle point and not a minimum.

On the other hand, if a constrained optimization is done (for example, with Lagrange multipliers), the problem may become one of saddle point finding, in which case the Hessian will be symmetric indefinite and the solution of formula_18 will need to be done with a method that will work for such, such as the formula_47 variant of Cholesky factorization or the conjugate residual method.

There also exist various quasi-Newton methods, where an approximation for the Hessian (or its inverse directly) is built up from changes in the gradient.

If the Hessian is close to a non-invertible matrix, the inverted Hessian can be numerically unstable and the solution may diverge. In this case, certain workarounds have been tried in the past, which have varied success with certain problems. One can, for example, modify the Hessian by adding a correction matrix formula_48 so as to make formula_49 positive definite. One approach is to diagonalize the Hessian and choose formula_48 so that formula_49 has the same eigenvectors as the Hessian, but with each negative eigenvalue replaced by formula_52.

An approach exploited in the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (which uses an approximate Hessian) is to add a scaled identity matrix to the Hessian, formula_53, with the scale adjusted at every iteration as needed. For large formula_54 and small Hessian, the iterations will behave like gradient descent with step size formula_55. This results in slower but more reliable convergence where the Hessian doesn&#x27;t provide useful information.

==Some caveats==

Newton&#x27;s method, in its original version, has several caveats:

# It does not work if the Hessian is not invertible. This is clear from the very definition of Newton&#x27;s method, which requires taking the inverse of the Hessian.
# It may not converge at all, but can enter a cycle having more than 1 point. See the {{slink|Newton&#x27;s method|Failure analysis}}.
# It can converge to a saddle point instead of to a local minimum, see the section &quot;Geometric interpretation&quot; in this article.

The popular modifications of Newton&#x27;s method, such as quasi-Newton methods or Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm mentioned above, also have caveats:

For example, it is usually required that the cost function is (strongly) convex and the Hessian is globally bounded or Lipschitz continuous, for example this is mentioned in the section &quot;Convergence&quot; in this article. If one looks at the papers by Levenberg and Marquardt in the reference for Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, which are the original sources for the mentioned method, one can see that there is basically no theoretical analysis in the paper by Levenberg, while the paper by Marquardt only analyses a local situation and does not prove a global convergence result. One can compare with Backtracking line search method for Gradient descent, which has good theoretical guarantee under more general assumptions, and can be implemented and works well in practical large scale problems such as Deep Neural Networks.

<text>In mathematics, an algebra bundle is a fiber bundle whose fibers are algebras and local trivializations respect the algebra structure. It follows that the transition functions are algebra isomorphisms. Since algebras are also vector spaces, every algebra bundle is a vector bundle.

Examples include the tensor-algebra bundle, exterior bundle, and symmetric bundle associated to a given vector bundle, as well as the Clifford bundle associated to any Riemannian vector bundle.

<doc id="1244539" wikidata="Q951265" url="?curid=1244539" title="Might Is Right">
<text>Might Is Right orThe Survival of the Fittest is a book by pseudonymous author Ragnar Redbeard, generally believed to be a pen name of Arthur Desmond. First published in 1896, it advocates amorality, consequentialism, and psychological hedonism.

== Content ==
The author sums up his work as follows:

In &quot;Might Is Right&quot;, Redbeard rejects conventional ideas such as advocacy of human and natural rights and argues in addition that only strength or physical might can establish moral right (à la Callicles or Thrasymachus). The book also attacks Christianity and democracy. Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s theories of master–slave morality and herd mentality served as inspirations for Redbeard&#x27;s book which was written contemporaneously.

James J. Martin, the individualist anarchist historian, called it &quot;surely one of the most incendiary works ever to be published anywhere.&quot; This refers to the book&#x27;s assertions that weakness should be regarded with hatred and the strong and forceful presence of Social Darwinism. Other parts of the book deal with the topics of race and male–female relations. The book claims that the woman and the family as a whole are the property of the man, and it proclaims that the Anglo-Saxon race is innately superior to all other races. The book also contains anti-Christian and anti-Semitic statements.

== Authorship ==
S. E. Parker writes in his introduction to the text: &quot;The most likely candidate is a man named Arthur Desmond who was red-bearded, red-haired and whose poetry was very similar to that written by Redbeard.&quot; &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, a journal associated with the Australian labour movement, reported in July 1900 that Desmond (a former contributor to the publication) was Ragnar Redbeard.

The Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey and white supremacist publisher Katja Lane (wife of The Order member David Lane) both believed novelist Jack London was substantially involved, if not the author of the entire book; the latter based her judgment on London&#x27;s distinctive grammar and punctuation. However, this idea was rejected by Rodger Jacobs, a biographer of London, since London was only 20 years old at the time and had not yet developed that writing style, nor had he read anything by Nietzsche.

==Response==
Leo Tolstoy, whom &quot;Might Is Right&quot; described as &quot;the ablest modern expounder of primitive Christliness&quot;, responded in his 1897 essay &quot;What Is Art?&quot;:

S. E. Parker wrote: &quot;&quot;Might Is Right&quot; is a work flawed by major contradictions.&quot; In particular, he criticized the inconsistency of the book&#x27;s central dogma of individualism with its open sexism and racism (both requiring a membership in a collective). However, he concluded that &quot;it is sustained by a crude vigor that at its most coherent can help to clear away not a few of the religious, moral and political superstitions bequeathed to us by our ancestors.&quot;

==Influence==
Portions of &quot;Might Is Right&quot; comprise the vast majority of &quot;The Book of Satan&quot; in Anton LaVey&#x27;s 1969 &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, the founding document of the Church of Satan. Though it is no longer included in current printings of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, early printings included an extensive dedication to various people whom LaVey recognized as influences, including Ragnar Redbeard.

Santino William Legan, the perpetrator of the 2019 Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting in Gilroy, California, mentioned &quot;Might is Right&quot; in an Instagram post. NBC journalists have claimed it is a &#x27;staple&#x27; of white supremacist groups online.

<text>Seven Separate Fools is the eighth studio album by American rock band Three Dog Night. Released in 1972, the album reached number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting album. The LP version of the album was released with seven large playing cards (each nearly 12 inches in height) as an extra bonus.

Beach Boys founder Brian Wilson, who contributed &quot;Time to Get Alone&quot; to the pre-TDN vocal trio Redwood, placed the LP at No. 3 among his all-time Top Ten favorite records in a 2016 conversation with Esquire&#x27;s Middle East branch. Wilson succinctly stated, &quot;Danny Hutton’s vocals are truly on point.&quot;

<doc id="1244554" wikidata="Q329588" url="?curid=1244554" title="Sadao Watanabe (musician)">
<text>is a Japanese jazz musician who plays alto saxophone and sopranino saxophone. He is known for his bossa nova recordings, although his work encompasses many styles, with collaborations from musicians all over the world.

==Career==
Watanabe was born on 1 February 1933 in Utsunomiya, Japan. His father, a professional musician, sang and played the biwa. Watanabe was attracted to jazz from an early age, in part due to the strong cultural influence stemming from the American post-war presence in Japan. He learned the clarinet while in high school after convincing his father over the course of six weeks to buy him a second-hand instrument.

In 1951, Watanabe moved to Tokyo and began playing the alto saxophone. He started studying the flute in 1953 with Ririko Hayashi from the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. Watanabe joined Toshiko Akiyoshi&#x27;s Cozy Quartet and began leading the group when Akiyoshi moved to the USA. By 1958, Watanabe had performed with leading musicians and quartets. In 1961, his first album as a leader, the self-titled &quot;Sadao Watanabe&quot;, was released. 

In 1962, he left Japan to study at Berklee College of Music in Boston. Studying led Watanabe to a broadened stylistic scope that began to incorporate Brazilian music. During his time in the USA, he worked with Gary McFarland, Chico Hamilton, and Gábor Szabó. 

Watanabe returned to Tokyo in 1965. There, he became the director of the new Yamaha Institute of Popular Music, a school that based its curriculum on Berklee&#x27;s. From 1966 onwards, he toured Japan and internationally with his own quartet, playing bop, Brazilian music, jazz-rock, soul, and pop music. He played with the John Coltrane quintet in Tokyo while the group was touring Japan in 1966. By the time Watanabe played at the 1970 Newport Jazz Festival, he was a well-known and often highly-regarded jazz performer.

In 1969, Watanabe began working part time as a radio broadcaster, promoting jazz across Japan. From 1972, his programme &quot;My Dear Life&quot; ran for 20 years. He continued to perform internationally, including performances at Montreux Jazz Festival and Newport Jazz Festival. In 1970, he released his album &quot;Round Trip&quot;, featuring Chick Corea, Jack DeJohnette, and Miroslav Vitouš. 
Watanabe continued performing and recording throughout the 1970s and 1980s, amassing a catalogue of more than 70 albums as leader. 

In addition to his musical career, Watanabe has published six photography books in Japan.

Watanabe has been in charge of the visiting professor of Jazz course at Kunitachi College of Music since 2010.

<doc id="1244583" wikidata="Q3933942" url="?curid=1244583" title="MOT test">
<text>The MOT test (or simply MOT) is an annual test of vehicle safety, aspects and exhaust emissions required in the United Kingdom for most vehicles over three years old. In Northern Ireland the equivalent requirement applies after four years. The requirement does not apply to vehicles used &quot;only&quot; on various small islands with no convenient connection &quot;to a road in any part of Great Britain&quot;; no similar exemption is listed at the beginning of 2014 for Northern Ireland, which has a single inhabited island, Rathlin. The MOT test was first introduced in 1960 as a few basic tests of a vehicle and now covers twenty different parts or systems on or in the vehicle.

The name derives from the Ministry of Transport, a defunct government department, which was one of several ancestors of the current Department for Transport, but is still officially used. MOT test certificates are currently issued in Great Britain under the auspices of the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), an executive agency of the Department for Transport. Certificates in Northern Ireland are issued by the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA). The test and the pass certificate are often referred to simply as the &quot;MOT&quot;.

More than 23,500 local car repair garages throughout England, Scotland and Wales, employing more than 65,800 testers, are authorised to perform testing and issue certificates. In principle, any individual in Great Britain can apply to run a MOT station, although in order to gain an authorisation from DVSA, both the individual wanting to run the station, as well as the premises, need to meet minimal criteria set out on the government&#x27;s website, within the so-called VT01 form.

In Northern Ireland, tests are performed exclusively at the DVA&#x27;s own test centres.

==History==
The MOT test was first introduced on a voluntary basis on 12 September 1960 under the direction of the-then Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples, under powers in the Road Traffic Act 1956. The test was originally a basic test including brakes, lights and steering check which was to be carried out after the vehicle was ten years old and every year thereafter. This became known as the &quot;ten year test&quot;, or alternatively the &quot;Ministry of Transport Test&quot;. A fee is applicable to the test and the amount involved for a car when testing was first introduced in 1960 was fourteen shillings (70 new (decimal) pence) plus one shilling (five new pence) for the certificate. The voluntary period ended on 15 February 1961 and the high test failure rate resulted in the age that vehicles became due for testing being reduced to seven years on 31 December 1961. In 1962, the first commercial vehicle exam was created and a valid certificate was required in order to receive a tax disc, and in April 1967, the testable age for an MOT was reduced to three years. On 1 January 1983, the testable age for ambulances, taxis and vehicles with more than eight passenger seats (excluding the driver&#x27;s) was reduced to one year.

The list of items tested has been continually expanded over the years, including:
* 1968 – a tyre check
* 1977 – checks of windscreen wipers and washers, indicators, brake lights, horns, exhaust system and condition of the body structure and chassis
* 1991 – checks of the emissions test for petrol engine vehicles, together with checks on the anti-lock braking system, rear wheel bearings, rear wheel steering (where appropriate) and rear seat belts
* 1992 – a stricter tyre tread depth requirement for most vehicles
* 1994 – a check of emissions for diesel engine vehicles
* 2005 – introduction of a computerised administration system for issuing non-secure test certificates, and the creation of the &#x27;Automated Test Bay&#x27; which differed from traditional testing by installing equipment in the bay to obviate the need for a tester&#x27;s assistant during the test
* 2012 – checks of secondary restraint systems, battery and wiring, electronic stability control, speedometers and steering locks.

In recent years there have been attempts to change the frequency of the MOT in the UK, including moving to a test every two years, or changing the age that vehicles become due for testing to four years, instead of three. However, these changes have been dismissed following government consultations, on the grounds of safety. Most recently, it was suggested by former Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, that the MOT again move to a biennial check, to help motorists save money as a result of the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. This plan has yet to be officially taken to consultation by the government, but has provoked response from safety organisations.

==International regulations==
In order to allow vehicles to travel from one country to another, some international regulations require tests to be performed on vehicles. This is, for instance, required by the 1997 UNECE Agreement and by Directive 2014/45/EC on periodic road-worthiness tests, Directive 2014/47/EC on technical roadside inspections of commercial vehicles and Directive 2014/46/EC.

==Test classification==
The test classes are:

* Class I – Motor bicycles (with or without side cars) up to 200cc

==Fees==
All test stations are required to display a &quot;VT9A Fees and Appeals&quot; poster on their premises which must be available to the public. As of 6 April 2010, these are the maximum fees that can be charged. They are not subject to VAT.

==Rules and regulations for the United Kingdom==

The actual designation for the pass certificate is VT20, and failure is the VT30, with any advisories being the VT32. The MOT test will provide an emissions report if applicable.

It is illegal to use a non-exempt vehicle that requires a test without a current MOT on any way defined as a &quot;road&quot; in the Road Traffic Act 1988; it does not apply only to highways (or in Scotland a relevant &quot;road&quot;) but includes other places available for public use, which are not highways. This applies except when driving to or from (subject to insurance terms and conditions) a booked MOT test or to have remedial work done to rectify failures in a previous test. Possession of an up-to-date VT20 test certificate is a pre-requisite for obtaining vehicle excise duty, and advertisements for used cars frequently say how many months are left to run on the current MOT (i.e., VT20 certificate; although the VT20 points out that it does not, in any way, guarantee road-worthiness at the time of sale). A vehicle could suffer major damage after a MOT has been carried out, but the certificate would still be valid, and obtaining a new one is not required by law (some insurance companies may require a new test, but this is their practice, not law). However, driving a vehicle which is in a dangerous condition on a public road is always illegal, irrespective of its test status.

The official MOT inspection manuals are available online.

==Overview of the test==
In Great Britain MOT testing centres are regulated and licensed by the Department and Transport and DVSA for the purpose, and the individual testers carrying out the inspections also have to be trained and certified. The main purpose of the MOT test is to check if a vehicle meets the main UK road safety standards. The decision to pass or fail each presented vehicle comes down to the discretion of the tester following the guidelines issued by the DVSA.

The MOT test covers the following aspects:

* Exhaust and emissions
* Seat belts
* Steering
* Windscreen
* Bonnet catch
* Horn
* Number plate
* Lights
* Brakes
* Tyres and wheels
* Mirrors
* Doors
* Seats
* Suspension
* Fuel system
* Body and structure
* Battery and wiring

The inspection manual can be found online. The full details must by law be provided on request by all garages licensed to perform MOT tests and are currently published in DVSA&#x27;s leaflet &quot;The MOT Test and You&quot;.

An MOT test certificate confirms that at the time of test, the vehicle has met the minimum acceptable environmental and road safety standards. It does not mean that the vehicle is roadworthy for the life of the certificate. The test does not cover the condition of the engine (other than the emissions), clutch or gearbox. Maintenance that is necessary for the reliable and efficient operation of the vehicle – but not its safety – forms part of a service inspection that is recommended by manufacturers, but is not a legal requirement for operating the vehicle on the public highway.

Items such as the windscreen, wipers and exhaust systems are tested for condition and operation. Windscreen wipers will fail the test if they do not adequately clear the windscreen when used in conjunction with the washers. The exhaust system, in addition to checks on its condition and security, is tested to ascertain whether it is obviously louder than another vehicle of the same make and model with a standard exhaust system fitted. Dismantling of any part of the vehicle during the MOT test is strictly against test regulations, making the assessment of corrosion or worn components in certain areas on certain car models very difficult to determine accurately. As the MOT is only an inspection for roadworthiness at the time of test, the inspection of most accessories is not included. One exception is tow bars: their condition and their attachment to the vehicle is now included in the MOT.

=== Lighting exemption ===

A vehicle that has no front- and rear-position lights fitted or has had those lights permanently removed, painted or masked-over is exempt from the lighting sections of the MOT test. An advisory note will be provided on the VT32 as a reminder that the vehicle should be used only during daylight hours and not used at times of seriously reduced visibility.

This is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a &quot;Daytime MOT&quot;, but there is no official distinction. It is the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations that prevent an unlit vehicle being used on the road after dark, not the MOT.

== Historic (classic) vehicles exemption ==
A vehicle is exempt from the MOT if it was manufactured or first registered more than forty years ago and no &quot;substantial changes&quot; have been made to the vehicle in the last thirty years. This includes vehicles previously exempted on the basis of being first registered before 1960. A vehicle alteration is a &quot;substantial change&quot; if the technical characteristics of the main components have changed in the previous thirty years, unless these fall into the acceptable alterations category. Different rules apply to large vehicles.

An exempt vehicle must be roadworthy.

==Re-tests==

When a vehicle fails the MOT test it can be re-tested within the end of ten working days to gain a pass. There may be a charge payable. If the vehicle remains at the test station for repair after failure then it can have a free partial re-test within ten working days after the original test has been carried out. If it is removed from the premises for repair and then returned before the end of ten working days it can have a retest at half the original fee paid. If the failed vehicle is taken away but then brought back to the same test station and retested before the end of the next working day on one or more of the following items only then no fee is charged for a retest:
Bonnet, horn, sharp edges, boot lid, lamps, steering wheel, brake pedal anti-slip, loading door, tailboard, direction indicators, mirrors, tailgate, doors rear reflectors, VIN, drop sides, registration plates, windscreen and glass, fuel filler cap, seat belts, wipers and washers, hazard warning, seats, wheels and tyres.

After the ten-day period a full MOT test will have to be carried out. The full MOT test fee is charged again.

Test stations and the DVSA&#x27;s website provide full and up-to-date information regarding MOT re-tests.

The fee for testing and retesting is at the discretion of the proprietor of the test facility, subject to legal maximum prices. The vehicle owner is only subject to one retest per MOT test. If the vehicle fails the MOT retest it is then subject to a full MOT test at the full MOT test fee.

==Appeals against MOT inspections==

Motorists who recently had a vehicle MOT tested and disagree with the outcome of the inspection are entitled to an appeal against the decision. The appeal must be lodged with DVSA/DVA within 28 days of the original test date if the items in question are mechanical in nature; three months are allowed for corrosion issues, except for corrosion of brake discs, brake lines or the exhaust system. Mileage, or the lack thereof, incurred after the inspection has no relevance to the appeal even if the vehicle has not been used for several months after the test.

If the items in question are repaired, replaced or removed from the vehicle, the right of the owner to appeal becomes null and void. Failure because of items easily replaceable, such as tyres or windscreen wiper blades, may not be appealed against, as it cannot be adequately determined if they were the ones fitted at the time of inspection.

To appeal against a MOT pass is free of charge, but appeals against a failure incur a fee whose value would amount to the normal maximum price of a MOT for that vehicle. This fee is then refunded if the appellate inspection finds in favour of the motorist lodging the appeal. If the appellate inspection finds the vehicle was incorrectly diagnosed, DVSA/DVA takes appropriate action against the station involved. This can range from penalty points being issued for minor infringements, to the station&#x27;s MOT licence being rescinded for more major violations.

DVSA/DVA has only the power to discipline the station involved and cannot pursue compensation of any kind for the complainant; that is the responsibility of Trading Standards. A MOT station cannot be held responsible for defects that occur to the vehicle several months after the test was conducted. The appeal process is outlined on the reverse of the VT20 pass certificate and the VT30 failure notice.

==Mileage==
It is a common misconception that the MOT inspection provides an irrefutable record of a vehicle&#x27;s mileage. However, although the mileage is recorded during the test, no part of the inspection requires the test station to verify that this is indeed the &quot;actual&quot; mileage. It is merely recorded, and any tampering of an odometer would not be discovered as part of the MOT inspection.

==Changes==
===2012===
In 2012 the MOT test was radically overhauled with many items not previously included in the test now becoming standard.

It also saw the introduction in Great Britain of &#x27;receipt style&#x27; plain paper certificates that serve as a notification that a &#x27;pass&#x27; entry has been recorded on the DVSA database. The MOT test number contained on the certificate gives access to the vehicle&#x27;s current test status as well as its test history from 2005 onwards, via the DVSA web site. MOT certificates in Northern Ireland continue to be issued on paper, accompanied by a paper &#x27;certificate disc&#x27; which must be displayed on the vehicle. Display of these discs has been mandatory on Northern Ireland tested cars since 2008. However, this was abolished in April 2015.

From 18 November, the MOT certificate shows the vehicle&#x27;s recent mileage history. This was introduced as part of a government initiative to reduce vehicle crime. Where available, the mileage history will comprise the readings associated with the three most recent VT20s (test passes) along with the date of those readings.

===2018===
From 20 May 2018, the way that the MOT test works in England, Scotland and Wales changed to comply with EU Directive 2014/45. This involved some changes to the way the test is carried out and reported, with the basic essence of the test remaining the same. After 20 May 2018, vehicles first registered forty years prior were exempt from the requirement for a MOT test.

===2019===
From 1 October 2019, the way that the MOT test worked in England, Scotland and Wales changed to comply with the new connected equipment legislation. This only applied to any applications to open a new MOT centre, reopen a MOT centre or make a change of ownership of a MOT centre.

===2020===
From 1 April 2020, all Class 4 vehicle MOT expiry dates were extended by six months if the date fell on or after 30 March 2020. This was implemented due to the coronavirus outbreak across the UK. Although the six-month exemption was granted, vehicles that were still being used were required to be kept in a roadworthy condition, and penalties were still issued for driving a vehicle in a dangerous condition.

===2021===
From 1 May 2021, exhaust gas analysers and diesel smoke meters were able to connect directly to the MOT testing service as part of the connected equipment legislation.

==Emissions testing in Northern Ireland==
Emissions tests on diesel cars have not been carried out during MOTs in Northern Ireland since 2006, despite being a legal requirement.

<text>The Devil&#x27;s Notebook is the fourth book by Anton LaVey, published in 1992 by Feral House. It includes a foreword by Adam Parfrey and design by Sean Tejaratchi. The book contains forty-one essays in which LaVey provides commentary on such topics as nonconformity, occult faddism, Nazism, terrorism, cannibalism, erotic politics, the “Goodguy badge”, demoralization and the construction of artificial human companions. Included are instructions for the creation of what LaVey terms &quot;total environments&quot;, or places of magical evocation, where the enlightened may escape the deleterious effects of contemporary existence.

<text>Robert Michael Bellotti (born December 21, 1950) is an American college football analyst for ESPN and ABC. He was with the University of Oregon&#x27;s football program for over 20 years serving as offensive coordinator for six years, head coach for 14 years, and athletic director for one year. Bellotti is the winningest coach in Oregon football history and is credited with building the program into a major football power. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Early life==
Bellotti attended Ygnacio Valley High School in Concord, California, where he played football, basketball and baseball and graduated in 1969. After high school, he went to the University of California, Davis and played football at the positions of tight end and wide receiver. He started at tight end as a sophomore and junior, then earned second-team all-Far Western Conference honors at wide receiver as senior. Bellotti graduated from UC Davis with a B.A. in Physical Education in 1973. He completed the teaching credential program at UC Davis in 1974. In 1982, Bellotti earned his Master of Science degree in Physical Education at California State University, East Bay (then known as Cal State-Hayward). He is an alumnus of the Delta Sigma Phi fraternity.

==Coaching career==

===UC Davis===
In 1973, Bellotti started his career in football coaching at his alma mater as an assistant coach under College Football Hall of Fame coach Jim Sochor. The next season, he worked as the JV team&#x27;s offensive coordinator, and during the 1975 and 1976 seasons he was the JV team&#x27;s head coach. Also at that time, he served as the receivers coach for the varsity team and as a coach for UC Davis&#x27; JV baseball team.

===Cal State Hayward===
Bellotti was hired at California State University, Hayward (Cal State Hayward or CSU-Hayward; now California State University, East Bay) in 1977 and worked as the offensive coordinator for two seasons. He returned to the school as offensive coordinator in 1980, and remained until 1983. In 1982, he earned a master&#x27;s degree from the school in physical education.

===Weber State===
In 1979, Bellotti served as offensive coordinator at Weber State University, returning to CSU-Hayward after just one season.

===Chico State===
California State University, Chico (Chico State) hired Bellotti to serve as their head football coach in 1984. He remained head coach until 1988 and compiled a record of 21–25–2. His record in the Northern California Athletic Conference was 15–9–2.

===Oregon===
University of Oregon head coach Rich Brooks hired Bellotti as offensive coordinator in 1989. Bellotti remained in that position through the 1994 season, when Brooks left to coach in the National Football League, and Bellotti was promoted to head coach starting with the 1995 season.

Bellotti&#x27;s record at Oregon stands at 116–55. In 2006, he passed his former boss, Rich Brooks, as the winningest football coach in Oregon&#x27;s history. He led the Ducks to their first four ten-win seasons in school history (2000, 2001, 2005, 2008); they had only won nine games on three occasions in the 100 years before Bellotti took over. He led the Ducks to 12 bowl games, three more than they had attended in their entire history before his arrival. His best season was 2001, when he led the Ducks to an 11–1 record and a victory in the Fiesta Bowl. They finished second in both major polls, the highest final ranking in school history. The 11 wins would remain a school record until the 2010 team&#x27;s 12-win season.

Bellotti also led Oregon to a regular season #2 ranking in the 2007 season, albeit very briefly. After achieving that ranking, the Ducks lost Heisman Trophy candidate quarterback Dennis Dixon to a season-ending knee injury, and Oregon proceeded to lose three straight games to Arizona, UCLA, and arch-rival Oregon State to close out the regular season. Earlier that season, Bellotti had led Oregon to a resounding 39–7 victory over Michigan at &quot;The Big House&quot;, earning the Ducks and Dixon much national attention. Oregon also defeated #9 USC and #6 Arizona State in back-to-back games at Autzen Stadium earlier that season. Oregon recovered from their three-game losing streak following the Dixon injury by defeating South Florida in the Sun Bowl in dominating fashion (56–21), thus ending a streak of four straight bowl losses for the Ducks. In 2008, the Ducks recovered strongly from a mid-season lull to win their last four games against solid competition, including a Holiday Bowl win over 13th-ranked Oklahoma State. Although he only won two Pac-10 titles due to the latter half of his tenure being occupied by USC&#x27;s dominance of the conference, Bellotti is still credited with building Oregon into a major football power nonetheless.

==Oregon athletic director==
On December 2, 2008, shortly after defeating the Oregon State Beavers in the Civil War to prevent them from clinching a Rose Bowl berth, the university announced that Bellotti would pass the head coaching position on to offensive coordinator Chip Kelly at some undetermined point in the future and take over as the university&#x27;s athletic director at that time.

During his tenure as athletic director, Bellotti dealt with a number of disciplinary issues involving members of the football program, including LeGarrette Blount, LaMichael James, and Jeremiah Masoli, and fired long-time basketball coach Ernie Kent, whose teams had performed poorly in recent seasons. After just nine months on the job, Bellotti announced his resignation March 19, 2010 to join ESPN as a college football analyst. Bellotti had agreed to terms with UO officials, but there was no written contract. The resignation agreement, including the payout terms, was placed on paper and signed by Bellotti on March 16, with university president Richard Lariviere signing it on March 19. Because of the lack of an initial written contract, the Oregon Justice Department reviewed the $2.3 million severance payment from the University of Oregon to the former athletic director. In addition to the buyout Bellotti draws a $559,000 yearly pension from the Oregon Public Employees Retirement System.

In 2009, Bellotti was named third vice president of the American Football Coaches Association. According to AFCA tradition, he would move up to second vice president in 2010, first vice president in 2011 and president in 2012.

==ESPN analyst==
In March 2010, Bellotti announced that he was resigning as athletic director to become a college football television analyst on ESPN, with his first appearance on ESPN to occur in April.

<doc id="1244609" wikidata="Q4889118" url="?curid=1244609" title="Benjamin Piatt Runkle">
<text>Benjamin Piatt Runkle (September 3, 1836 – June 28, 1916) was an American military officer, Episcopal priest, and Freemason, who is noted as being one of the seven founders of Sigma Chi fraternity. Prior to joining the clergy, he served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He served as Chief Superintendent of Freedmen&#x27;s Affairs in Kentucky, and was plaintiff in the Supreme Court case Runkle v. United States. Runkle also twice served as trustee of Miami University.

==Early life==
Runkle was born in West Liberty, Ohio, to Ralph Edwin Runkle and Hannah Isabella Piatt. He attended Geneva College and, later, Miami University, from which he graduated in July 1857. While attending Miami University, Runkle became a Freemason as well as one of the seven founders of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

Runkle married Venitia Reynolds on June 4, 1857, and their daughter, Maud Elizabeth Runkle, was born on January 15, 1859, in Findlay, Ohio. After college, he studied law under General Samson Mason in Springfield and was admitted to the bar in July 1859. He was the 1860 Democratic candidate for the Ohio State Senate. Runkle volunteered for an Ohio militia company and, when the Civil War began, it became a part of the 13th Ohio Infantry.

==Civil War==

===13th Ohio Infantry===
Runkle was commissioned as a captain in the 13th Ohio Infantry on April 22, 1861, and served as such until November 8, 1861, when he was promoted to the rank of major after the Battle of Carnifex Ferry. In April 1862 the 13th Ohio, then in Virginia, made a forced march to join General Don Carlos Buell&#x27;s forces in Kentucky, then continued with Buell&#x27;s forces to the Battle of Shiloh. Upon arrival, the regiment led an attack that captured the Washington Artillery Battery of New Orleans. He was shot through the feet during a Confederate counter-attack, but continued until wounded again with a shot through the right jaw. He was thought to be mortally wounded, and Whitelaw Reid, then a correspondent for the Cincinnati Gazette, had seen Runkle&#x27;s wounds and filed a glowing obituary saying in part &quot;He died a hero. Green grows the grass above his grave.&quot; Runkle not only survived but outlived Reid, and in turn praised him in an obituary. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in May 1862.

===45th Ohio Infantry===
After recovering from his wounds, on August 19, 1862, he was commissioned Colonel of the 45th Ohio Infantry. The regiment was ordered to Cynthiana, Kentucky, where it remained until General Kirby Smith&#x27;s advance following the Confederate victory at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky on August 30, 1862, forced the 45th Ohio, along with the 99th Ohio Infantry, to pull back to the Ohio River at Covington, Kentucky, where they participated in the Defense of Cincinnati. In mid– February the regiment was mounted at Danville, Kentucky, and Colonel Runkle commanded the brigade formed by the mounted 45th Ohio along with the 7th Ohio Cavalry and 10th Kentucky Cavalry regiments. Runkle&#x27;s men broke the enemy line at the Battle of Dutton&#x27;s Hill in Somerset, Kentucky on March 30, 1863, and he was thanked for his gallantry on the field by Quincy Gillmore, the commanding general, who gave Colonel Runkle&#x27;s command entire credit for the victory. Fought in the Battle at Monticello, Kentucky on May 1, 1863, where Confederate forces under General Pegram were driven from the field.

===Other commands===
From July 1863 to January 1864, while recovering from wounds, he served on the staff of Ohio governor David Tod and led Ohio Militia units in response to Morgan&#x27;s Raid. He later commanded the 3rd Brigade of the 4th Division of the XXIII Corps in Kentucky and Tennessee and participated in Sherman&#x27;s Atlanta Campaign at the battles of Rocky Face Ridge and Resaca. Runkle was honorably mustered out July 21, 1864, and on August 29, 1864, he was appointed lieutenant colonel in the Veteran Reserve Corps where he commanded the 21st Regiment until the war ended.

==Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau==
While in the Veteran Reserve Corps, Runkle was assigned to work at the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands (Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau) where he served as Chief Superintendent of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau for Memphis, Tennessee.

On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Runkle for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from November 9, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.

He served as the Chief Superintendent of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau for Memphis, Tennessee during the violent Memphis Riots of 1866 on May 1, 1866, where, since he had few troops available, he was powerless to protect the black Union veterans who had been mustered out of the army the previous day. On January 7, 1869, Runkle became the head Superintendent of Freedmen&#x27;s Affairs, State of Kentucky. Since the government had announced plans to terminate Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau operations in Kentucky, Runkle, and his caretaker staff presided over bureau school closings and the dispersal of the remaining funds, which were completed in the summer of 1870, although the veterans&#x27; claim offices remained open through June 1872. While serving as both an active duty army major and as a disbursing officer of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau for the State of Kentucky in 1870, he was placed on the retired list as major, but continued as a disbursing officer until he was arrested and tried before a court-martial for financial irregularities on the part of his sub-agents for &quot;alleged failures to pay, or to pay in full&quot;.

==Court-martial==
The court-martial found Runkle guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman and of violating the March 2, 1863, c. 67, § 1, Act of Congress. His sentence was imprisonment, payment of a fine, and dismissal from the army, where he had been serving on the retired list and drawing retired pay. The Secretary of War, William W. Belknap, reviewed the proceedings and in 1873 issued an order approving Runkle&#x27;s conviction, but in consideration of his war service and wounds, granted Runkle executive clemency in the name of the President and eliminated the fine and prison sentence. However, his dismissal from the army remained in effect. Under the law at that time, any court-martial sentence involving an officer&#x27;s dismissal in peacetime needed to be confirmed by the President, and there was no indication in this order that the conviction was confirmed by President Ulysses S. Grant himself.

On the same day that he was cashiered, Runkle petitioned President Grant, complaining that his sentence had not been confirmed by the President. This petition was referred by Grant to the Judge Advocate General for review. Runkle objected to the court-martial specifically because President Grant had appointed the officers who served on it. Initially, General Joseph Holt, the Judge Advocate General, determined that the court-martial conformed to the Articles of War and that because the president, as commander in chief, had an inherent authority to convene courts-martial, Grant&#x27;s role in Runkle&#x27;s trial was sound. It remained open when President Rutherford B. Hayes came into office, as President Grant had done nothing further in the matter. On the advice of Holt&#x27;s successor, General William McKee Dunn, Hayes then picked it up as unfinished business and registered an order of disapproval, revoking the 1873 order dismissing Runkle.

==Supreme Court Case – Runkle v. United States==

On the authority of the executive order, Runkle was given retirement pay – both from the date of the Hayes order going forward and back pay to the date he was dismissed. In 1882, he claimed additional longevity pay, which was referred to the Court of Claims. In the Court of Claims, however, the government challenged his right to any pay at all, asserting that Hayes did not have the right to revoke the 1873 order confirming Runkle&#x27;s dismissal, and demanded Runkle reimburse the government for the pay he had received following Hayes&#x27; disapproval of the court-martial decision. Runkle appealed to the Supreme Court, which found in his favor, ruling that Runkle was never legally dismissed from the army, and was entitled to longevity pay, as well as the regular pay he already received, both before and after Secretary Belknap&#x27;s order was revoked.

==Later life==
When he retired from military service in 1870, Runkle was a major and brevetted colonel in the Regular Army. From 1879– to 1880 he studied at the Protestant Episcopal Theological Seminary in Gambier, Ohio, and from 1880–1885 served as rector of parishes at Galena, Ohio, Midland, Michigan, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Greencastle, Indiana. Runkle married his second wife, Lalla McMicken, February 10, 1894, in Los Angeles, California. Runkle was the only founder of Sigma Chi to become Grand Consul, serving as the seventh national president from 1895 to 1897.

Runkle held commands at the Peekskill Military Academy, the Military School in Freehold, New Jersey, and at the Miami Military Institute in Germantown, Ohio from 1902 to 1909. He served as trustee of Miami University from 1863–1872 and from 1912 until his death. Runkle died at his home in Hillsboro, Ohio on June 28, 1916, the fraternity&#x27;s sixty-first birthday. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Section 1, Grave 240, in Virginia.

<doc id="1244638" wikidata="Q680749" url="?curid=1244638" title="Trenck's Pandurs">
<text>Trenck&#x27;s Pandurs (, , Hungarian: Pandúr) were a light infantry unit of the Habsburg monarchy that was raised by Baron Franz von der Trenck under a charter issued by Maria Theresa of Austria in 1741. The unit was largely composed of volunteers from the Kingdom of Slavonia and Slavonian Military Frontier, and named after security guards otherwise employed to maintain public order. The Pandurs were presented to the empress in May 1741 with the unit&#x27;s military band earning them a claim of pioneering martial music in Europe. The Pandurs did not use uniforms and had an overall Ottoman appearance. The original organization of the unit was retained until 1745, when it transformed into a regiment. Trenck was relieved of command in 1746 and imprisoned in Spielberg Castle, where he died in 1749. The unit ultimately transformed into the 53rd Infantry Regiment, headquartered in Zagreb, until it was disbanded in 1919. The regiment&#x27;s commemorative medals bear Trenck&#x27;s image wearing Pandur attire.

The Pandurs took part in the War of the Austrian Succession, including the First and Second Silesian War. They contributed to the capture or destruction of Zobten am Berge, Strehlen, Klaus Castle, Linz, Deggendorf, Diessenstein Castle, Cham, Cosel fortress, and Munich. During the Battle of Soor, the unit looted a Prussian war chest and the belongings of Frederick the Great. The Pandurs earned a reputation as brave, audacious, feared and ruthless soldiers, known for looting and pillaging. They were prone to disobedience, breaches of military discipline and stubbornness. The city of Waldmünchen, located near Cham, celebrates the Pandurs and Trenck as the city&#x27;s saviors for sparing the city from destruction in 1742. The Pandurs&#x27; and Trenck&#x27;s heritage is also preserved in the city of Požega, Croatia, where an eponymous living history troop and city music band exist.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;pandur&quot; made its way into military use via the Hungarian language—being used in Hungarian as a loanword, in turn originating from the Croatian term &quot;pudar&quot;, though the nasal in place of the &quot;u&quot; suggests a borrowing before Croatian innovated its own reflex for Proto-Slavic /ɔ̃/. &quot;Pudar&quot; is still applied to security guards protecting crops in vineyards and fields, and it was coined from the verb &quot;puditi&quot; (also spelled &quot;pudati&quot;) meaning to chase or scare away. The meaning of the Hungarian loanword was expanded to guards in general, including law enforcement officers. The word was likely ultimately derived from medieval Latin &quot;banderius&quot; or &quot;bannerius&quot;, meaning either a guardian of fields or summoner, or follower of a banner.
 Another etymology could recall the ancient greek expression &quot;pan&quot; with &quot;ther&quot;, which is &quot;great&quot; or &quot;all-beast&quot;, already used in ancient times (see the latin word &quot;Panther&quot;, often used to refer to occupying troop soldiers of Roman Empire and root of the German word &quot;Panzer&quot; itself). 
By the middle of the 18th century, law enforcement in the counties of Croatia included county pandurs or hussars who patrolled roads and pursued criminals. In 1740, the term was applied to frontier guard duty infantry deployed in the Croatian Military Frontier (Banal Frontier), specifically its Karlovac and Varaždin Generalcies. The role of the pandurs as security guards was extended to Dalmatia after the establishment of Austrian rule there in the early 19th century. The term has dropped from official use for law enforcement officials, but it is still used colloquially in Croatia and the Western Balkans in a manner akin to the English word &quot;cop&quot;. The unit raised and led by Trenck is also referred to more specifically as &quot;Trenck&#x27;s Pandurs&quot;, and less frequently in Croatia than elsewhere, as &quot;Croatian Pandurs&quot;.

==History==
The Pandurs were a skirmisher unit of the Habsburg monarchy, raised by Baron Franz von der Trenck following a charter () issued by Maria Theresa of Austria on 27 February 1741, permitting Trenck to raise a 1,000-strong troop. The unit was largely composed of men enlisted as volunteers from areas of the Kingdom of Slavonia and Slavonian Military Frontier, consisting of ethnic Croats and Serbs. The Pandurs saw military action in Silesia, Bohemia, Bavaria, and France.

The Pandurs arrived in Vienna for a military parade for the empress on 27 May 1741. The unit was headed by Trenck and included two captains, a senior lieutenant, five lieutenants, a quartermaster, an adjutant, two chaplains (a Catholic and an Orthodox Christian), two medics, forty sergeants, five scribes, eighty corporals, and twelve musicians equipped with flutes, a drum and cymbals. The musicians were called the &quot;Turkish band&quot;, after Ottoman military bands, and are considered pioneers of martial music in Europe according to Jurica Miletić. The Pandurs did not have specific uniforms as their clothes varied but were of Turkish style. Their oriental appearance was compounded by mandatory head shaving, leaving a rattail, as well as by the use of a horse tail bunchuk instead of a unit banner. Each Pandur carried four single-shot pistols, a fighting knife, and a small utilitarian knife.
The Pandurs took part in War of the Austrian Succession, including the First Silesian War. They took part in capturing Zobten am Berge and Strehlen in Lower Silesia from the Prussians, and defending a bridgehead near Vienna after the Battle of Mollwitz. In 1742, the Pandurs took part in capture of Klaus Castle in Styria as well as Linz and Deggendorf, where they defeated French troops before taking part in Austrian recapture of Munich. By the end of that year, the Pandurs had captured Diessenstein Castle and Cham from Bavarian defenders, completely destroying Cham to secure access for Habsburg troops led by Ludwig Andreas von Khevenhüller to Bohemia. In 1743, the Pandurs led by Trenck captured Cosel fortress. In 1745, during the Second Silesian War, the Pandurs took part in the Battle of Soor, where they looted a Prussian war chest containing 80,000 ducats, as well as weapons, horses and a tent belonging to Frederick the Great.

The Pandurs earned a reputation for being brave and audacious, as well as feared and ruthless soldiers, looting and pillaging, but also characterized by disobedience, breaches of military discipline and stubbornness. On the other hand, the City of Waldmünchen, located near Cham, celebrates the Pandurs and Trenck as their savior for sparing the city from destruction in 1742. Since 1950, the city organizes a historical reenactment of the event involving about 300 actors.

The original organization of the unit was retained until 1745, when it was transformed into a Pandur regiment following Trenck&#x27;s petition to the empress. Trenck was relieved of command in 1746 and tried for unspecified &quot;acts of violence&quot;. He was imprisoned in Spielberg Castle, where he died in 1749. After the Peace of Aachen, the regiment was transformed into a Slavonian battalion on 22 December 1748. In 1756, as the Seven Years&#x27; War started, the battalion was reformed into the 53rd Infantry Regiment and its headquarters moved to Zagreb ending history of the Pandurs. Still, the regiment kept its Pandur lineage alive through its commemorative medals bearing Trenck&#x27;s image wearing Pandur attire. The regiment was disbanded in January 1919.

==Legacy==

The achievements of the Pandurs led by Trenck left a lasting mark on the culture and heritage of Croatia as well as Bavaria. An example of the unit&#x27;s legacy is found in the village of Trenkovo—named after the commander of the Pandurs in 1912. The village is located in area of Trenck&#x27;s former Velika estate, near Požega, Croatia, where the baron lived. It was the location of a baroque manor once owned by Trenck, which was replaced by another structure in the late 18th or early 19th centuries. Pandur heritage is preserved by the &quot;Trenck&#x27;s Pandurs&quot; () military band—the official music band of the city of Požega—established on 28 January 1881. In 1997, an eponymous living history troop was established out of members of the band. Also, a Trenck festival is held annually in Waldmünchen, commemorating the events of 1742, when the city was spared by Trenck from destruction.

The military unit and its leader also give their names to a modern armed force unit and modern military equipment. Special police platoon &quot;Trenk&quot;, formed in Požega on 8 March 1991, took part in the Croatian War of Independence. Steyr-Daimler-Puch produces the Pandur armoured fighting vehicle.

<text>Talking Union is a 1941 album by the Almanac Singers: Millard Lampell, Lee Hays and Pete Seeger. It is a collection of union songs and ballads, written by many different labor songwriters over the years. The liner notes include an introduction by Pete Seeger and song explanations by Philip Foner. In 2010 it was selected by the Library of Congress as an addition to the National Recording Registry, which selects recordings annually that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 1955 the album was rereleased on Folkways Records as &quot;The Original Talking Union &amp; Other Union Songs&quot;, expanded with seven songs recorded in 1955 by Pete Seeger and a chorus dubbed &quot;the Song Swappers&quot; that included Erik Darling, later of The Weavers, and Mary Travers, later of Peter, Paul and Mary.

<doc id="1244649" wikidata="Q17091360" url="?curid=1244649" title="Hard Labor">
<text>Hard Labor is the eleventh album by American rock band Three Dog Night, released in 1974. For this album, the band replaced long-time producer Richard Podolor with Jimmy Ienner, who was known for his production work with the Raspberries.

== Cover artwork ==
The original album cover, depicting the birth of a record album, was deemed too controversial and was first included with a manila file folder covering most of the cover. This was soon reworked with a huge Band-Aid covering the &quot;birth&quot;. Subsequent printings had the Band-Aid printed directly on the cover. The packaging also includes an attached &quot;birth record sheet&quot; for the album. The CD reissue by MCA Records in the 1990s restored the cover to its original look showing the record.

==Reception==

Tom Von Malder of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; called &quot;Hard Labor&quot; the band&#x27;s finest record up to that point, applauding the production and finding the choice of songs representing the band at &quot;its most competent, most mature level&quot;. Malder singled out &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d Be So Happy&quot; as its two best, and &quot;almost perfect&quot;, songs. &quot;Cash Box&quot; called Inner&#x27;s production &quot;immaculate as always&quot; and wrote that the album was marked by &quot;mood changes both subtle and obvious&quot;, making it a &quot;fantastic study in theatrical and musical contrast&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; found the track listing a &quot;fine mix of material&quot; and wrote that the instrumental section was &quot;tight and almost perfect&quot;.

&quot;Circus Raves&quot; writer Jon Tiven gave the record &quot;two ears&quot;—indicating an album to &quot;listen to ... &#x27;til the grooves grow old&quot; and wrote that the band &quot;are the best when they&#x27;re transforming half-arsed songs into good ones, but they run into trouble when the original rendition of the tune was fine in the first place (e.g. &#x27;The Show Must Go On&#x27;).&quot; Writing retrospectively, Joseph McCombs of &quot;AllMusic&quot; felt that the album&#x27;s preference for songs with solo vocals rather than the group&#x27;s previous use of harmonies led to the band &quot;los[ing] much of their soul and spirit&quot; and saw the album as &quot;show[ing] the growing cracks in the band&#x27;s armor&quot;. Like Malder, McCombs found &quot;I&#x27;d Be So Happy&quot; and &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; the highlights of the album.

<text>Charles Gerald John Cadogan, 8th Earl Cadogan, (24 March 1937 – 11 June 2023), styled as Viscount Chelsea until 1997, was a British billionaire peer and landowner. 

==Early life and education==
Cadogan was the son of William Gerald Charles Cadogan, 7th Earl Cadogan and Primrose Lilian Yarde-Buller, and was known as Viscount Chelsea before inheriting the title of Earl Cadogan on the death of his father on 4 July 1997. He was a first cousin of the Aga Khan IV, spiritual head of the Ismaili sect of Shia Muslims.

He was educated at Ludgrove School and Eton College.

==Military service==
On 14 April 1956, Cadogan was commissioned in the Coldstream Guards, British Army in the rank of second lieutenant to undertake his national service. On 26 September 1957, he was transferred to the Army Emergency Reserve of Officers, thereby ending his period of full-time service. He was promoted to lieutenant on 23 December 1957. On 2 March 1961, he was transferred to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers, thereby ending his military service.

==Career==
Cadogan chaired Chelsea Football Club from 1981 until 1982 and was also a Governor of Culford School in Suffolk. He owned Bedfordshire-based high-end upholstered furniture manufacturer, Peter Guild Ltd, (now based in Long Eaton) for a period during the 1990s.

He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant (DL) of Greater London in 1996. 

In the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List 2023&quot; ranking of the wealthiest people in the United Kingdom, his family was placed 36th with an estimated fortune of £5.57 billion. He was the third richest UK-based peer behind Hugh Grosvenor, 7th Duke of Westminster and Lord Bamford. The Cadogan family&#x27;s wealth is based on Cadogan Estates, which administers extensive landholdings in Chelsea, a wealthy part of London, including much of Sloane Street and Cadogan Hall.

In July 2021, he was worth over $6 billion according to Bloomberg.

==Honours==
* Salvation Army Cross of the Order of Distinguished Auxiliary Service - 1970 (for exceptional service rendered to the Army by non-Salvationists)
* Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) - 2012 Birthday Honours (for charitable services)

==Marriages and children==
On 6 June 1963 Cadogan married Lady Philippa Wallop (1937–1984), daughter of Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth. They had two sons and one daughter:

* Lady Anna-Karina Cadogan (born 4 February 1964)
* Edward Charles Cadogan, 9th Earl Cadogan (born 10 May 1966)
* Hon William John Cadogan (born 9 November 1973)

Cadogan married secondly the etiquette expert Jennifer Rae (married 1989, divorced 1994).

His third marriage was to Dorothy Ann Shipsey (married 1994), formerly the matron at King Edward VII Hospital for Officers.

==Death==
Cadogan died on 11 June 2023 at the age of 86. His titles passed to his elder son, Edward, who was educated at St David&#x27;s College, Llandudno and served with the RAF in the first Gulf war.

==District changes==
The number of students in rural communities dropped significantly across the 20th century. As farming technology progressed from animal power to small tractors towards large tractors over time, it allowed a farmer to support significantly more farm land. In turn, this led to fewer farm families, which led to fewer rural students. In combination with a loss of young men during foreign wars and rural flight, all of these caused an incremental population shrinkage of rural communities over time. In 1945 (after World War II), the &quot;School Reorganization Act&quot; in Kansas caused the consolidation of thousands of rural school districts in Kansas (mostly one room rural school houses). In 1963, the &quot;School Unification Act&quot; in Kansas caused the further consolidatation of thousands of tiny school districts into hundreds of larger Unified School Districts.

<text>Gerald Oakley Cadogan, 6th Earl Cadogan, CBE, DL (28 May 1869 – 4 October 1933) was a British peer and professional soldier.

He was the son of George Henry Cadogan, 5th Earl Cadogan and inherited his titles on 6 March 1915 on the death of his father, with two elder brothers having died without male heirs. He married Lilian Eleanor Marie Coxon, daughter of George Stewart Coxon, on 7 June 1911 at Christ Church, Mayfair, London. They had three children, the eldest son of whom was his heir William Gerald Charles Cadogan, 7th Earl Cadogan.

He joined the Army as a lieutenant in the Life Guards, but received a staff appointment as Aide-de-Camp (ADC) to his father when the latter became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1895. Cadogan continued as an Extra-ADC to Lord Dudley, who became Lord Lieutenant in August 1902, but resigned with him in 1905.

In July 1897 he was appointed a captain in the 3rd (West Suffolk Militia) Battalion, Suffolk Regiment. In January 1900 he was seconded for active service as a special service officer in South Africa during the Second Boer War, and he left Southampton early the following month on board the SS &quot;Canada&quot;. He later served with the South African Constabulary under the Military Governor of Pretoria, and returned to London in January 1902.

He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1919 and became Deputy Lieutenant (DL) of Suffolk. He was awarded the rank of Honorary Lieutenant-Colonel in the Suffolk Volunteer Regiment of the Volunteer Training Corps. He was a member of the International Olympic Committee from 1922 to 1929. In that role he is portrayed, by actor Patrick Magee, in the 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; as urging runner Eric Liddell to appear in an event where the Prince of Wales would be present that was on Sunday at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris.
On his death in 1933 aged 64 he was succeeded by his son William Gerald Charles Cadogan, 7th Earl Cadogan. His wife remarried.

Culford Park, the family seat, was sold and is now a private school.

<text>John Jones Pettus (October 9, 1813January 25, 1867) was an American politician, lawyer, and slave owner who served as the 23rd Governor of Mississippi, from 1859 to 1863. Before being elected in his own right to full gubernatorial terms in 1859 and 1861, he served as acting governor from January 5 to 10, 1854, following the resignation of Henry S. Foote. A member of the Democratic Party, Pettus had previously been a Mississippi state representative, and a member and president of the Mississippi State Senate. He strongly supported Mississippi&#x27;s secession from the United States and brought his state along as a founding member of the Confederate States of America in 1861. Pettus&#x27;s term of office came to an end in 1863, the same year that saw much of Mississippi overrun by Union forces. At the close of the war he fled to Arkansas to avoid prosecution and died there in 1867.

==Early life==
John Jones Pettus was born on October 9, 1813, in Wilson County, Tennessee, to John Pettus, a farmer, and his wife Alice Taylor (née Winston) Pettus. He was the brother of Edmund Pettus, and a distant cousin of Jefferson Davis. He was raised in Limestone County, Alabama, after his father moved the family from Tennessee. Only nine when his father died, Pettus helped with chores and was educated at home by his mother. Pettus settled in Mississippi in 1835. After a brief stay in Sumter County, Alabama, where he studied law, he opened a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. In the 1840s, he married a cousin, Permelia Winston. He became a farmer and by 1850 owned and enslaved twenty-four people. Permelia died in 1857 and Pettus married Sarah H. Potts, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama in 1861. During the Civil War, Pettus&#x27;s son John joined one of the Mississippi regiments in Virginia and was killed at the Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff in October, 1861. 

==Antebellum political career==
In 1844, Pettus represented Kemper County in the Mississippi House of Representatives. In 1848, he was elected to the Mississippi Senate. In 1853, while Governor Henry S. Foote was waiting for the January 11 inauguration of John J. McRae, Foote grew bitter and angry, addressing the legislative session by announcing that he had considered resigning in protest once the election results came in. At noon on January 5, 1854, Foote&#x27;s resignation was received by the state senate.

The Mississippi Constitution of 1832 had abolished the office of lieutenant governor. As President of the Mississippi Senate, Pettus was next in seniority and sworn in at noon on January 7, 1854. He held the governorship until McRae was sworn in on January 10, 1854. His only recorded act during these 120 hours was to order a special session in Noxubee County to fill the office of a deceased state representative, Francis Irby. On January 11, McRae was inaugurated as governor, and Pettus returned as senate president. During the 1850s, he became identified as &quot;the Mississippi Fire-eater,&quot; a term referring to Southerners supporting secession. As a state senator, Pettus developed a reputation as a &quot;disunion man of the most unmitigated order&quot;, advocating for Mississippi delegates to attend the Nashville Convention and discuss the possibility of secession during the 1850 political crisis. 

In 1859, Pettus was elected governor by a 3-1 margin. In his inaugural address, he said that the South&#x27;s only way to maintain slavery was secession and a Southern Confederacy, and he pledged to defend the &quot;superiority and supremacy of the white race&quot; against &quot;Black Republicans&quot;. Following President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s election, on November 26, 1860, Pettus called for a special session of the state legislature and advocated for a convention to withdraw Mississippi from the United States. The Legislature called for a Secession Convention which convened in Jackson on January 7, 1861. Two days later, the state officially declared its withdrawal from the US. On February 4, 1861, Mississippi along with other slave states formed the Confederate States of America, precipitating the American Civil War.

==Civil war==

With the outbreak of the Civil War, Pettus was faced with numerous challenges, first and foremost being the military situation. While large numbers of volunteers began organizing themselves into military companies immediately after the 1860 Presidential election, Mississippi lacked the funds and arms to supply them. Mounting frustration developed between the Confederate government and Mississippi regarding manpower, because the state took the position that regiments should only be transferred to Confederate service once fully armed. Although some regiments were outfitted at private expense and mustered into the Confederate Army, the state legislature did not supply sufficient funds to buy weapons and lacked existing arsenals to supply the volunteers. To minimize the number of unequipped troops with nothing to do, Pettus instituted a moratorium on volunteer enlistments in May 1861 until the existing units could be properly armed. 

Some of the Mississippi volunteer regiments were sent to Virginia to join the Confederate Army, while others remained in the service of the state and were sent to the Gulf Coast during the Pensacola campaign to besiege Federal forts and resist any attempt at a coastal invasion. Mississippi troops occupied Ship Island to take control of its strategic deep water port, but Union gunboats forced them off the island in September 1861. Ship Island remained under Union control for the rest of the war, serving as a base for the capture of New Orleans and raids on the Mississippi coast. 

In response to a call for aid from Confederate forces in Kentucky, on September 28, 1861 Governor Pettus asked for 10,000 volunteers to enlist in state&#x27;s armed forces. The legislature voted funds to pay for this force, deemed the &quot;Army of 10,000&quot;, but only authorized a 60-day term of service and did not provide weapons. Before even half of the quota of 10,000 men could be filled, the troops were sent north with inadequate supplies and training. The volunteers in Kentucky did not see combat, but they were exposed to severe winter weather and outbreaks of disease before returning to Mississippi at the end of January 1862. 

Despite some discontent that he had mismanaged the military situation and had been too slow to act at the outbreak of hostilities, Pettus was renominated by his party and re-elected as Governor by an overwhelming margin in October 1861. 

Pettus, like many other southern governors, sought to keep a state military force under his personal control for home defense, while faced with a War Department seeking to enlist as many men as possible into the Confederate Army. However, it was clear from the experience of the Army of 10,000 that poorly-armed troops enlisting for very short terms of service were of little military use. On January 29, 1862, the state&#x27;s armed forces were reorganized as the Mississippi State Troops. Men who were not otherwise serving in the Confederate army or eligible for an exemption were drafted into the State Troops for 6-month terms of service and stationed in military camps throughout the state. While some State Troops units saw combat during the siege of Vicksburg, most were idle in camps for the duration of their service, and there were numerous complaints that the state troops could be put to better use elsewhere, either guarding against a slave revolt in their home communities or working in agriculture to supply the civilian population with food. Rates of desertion, absence without leave, and requests for medical discharge from the State Troops were high and they never served as an effective military force. However, Pettus feared that without a state force at his disposal, Mississippi would be powerless to defend itself from Union forces, writing to Confederate President Jefferson Davis in 1863 that the state troops were &quot;necessary to save north Miss from being over run and desolated while all the Confederate Troops were engaged with superior forces of the enemy”. 

Economic circumstances in Mississippi also became severe very quickly. The state faced shortages of staple goods such as salt, which was not produced in Mississippi and was essential for nutrition and food preservation. At the governor&#x27;s urging in January 1863 the state legislature voted $500,000 to obtain salt, and Pettus dispatched agents to other Southern states to try to acquire it. After the Federal Navy enacted a blockade of the Confederacy, Mississippi&#x27;s cotton crop could not be exported and exchanged for hard currency and essential goods. Facing shortages and massive inflation, Pettus reluctantly allowed cotton merchants to illegally trade with Union forces, and he struggled to convince farmers to grow food crops that could feed the civilian population rather than cotton that could be sold for US dollars. Pettus&#x27;s administration banned alcohol manufacturing to conserve grain for food, but this directive was widely ignored. 

1862 witnessed battles at Corinth and Iuka in North Mississippi as Union forces sought to capture vital railroad junctions in the state. Aware that the Mississippi River was a strategic objective for the Union, Pettus encouraged the legislature to allow the impressment of slaves to build defensive works at Vicksburg, Jackson, and Port Hudson, Louisiana. This effort was stymied by large plantation owners who often refused to send their slaves to work on military construction projects. The state capital at Jackson was captured by Union troops on May 14, 1863. Pettus fled to Enterprise and re-established the capital there. Union forces left Jackson, focusing their efforts on the fortress-city of Vicksburg, which surrendered on July 4. 29,000 Confederate troops were captured at Vicksburg, and US forces attacked Jackson again, burning much of the town in late July. By the fall of 1863, the coast, north, &amp; west of Mississippi were all occupied by the Union Army, and Pettus was on the run, at one point having to flee into Alabama to avoid Union patrols. 

==Later life==
Ineligible under the Mississippi Constitution to run for a third term, Pettus left office in November 1863 and became a colonel in the State Troops, assigned to recruiting duties at Grenada and Macon. After the Confederate defeat, he took the oath of allegiance to the United States in September 1865, but failed on three separate occasions to receive a presidential pardon. Fearing prosecution as a traitor to the United States, he fled to Pulaski County (present-day Lonoke County, Arkansas) to avoid capture. Pettus died on January 25, 1867, of pneumonia and is buried in the Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

<doc id="1244678" wikidata="Q17507090" url="?curid=1244678" title="Regions of Iran">
<text>Iran has been divided into regions in a number of different ways historically. It has been divided into five administrative regions ( , singular ) since 2014.

==Current administrative regions==
Iran&#x27;s thirty-one provinces were grouped into five regions on 22 June 2014, based on a decision by the Ministry of Interior. In this change, the adjacency, geographical location and similarities of the provinces were considered.

The Constitution of Iran does not provide for regions and they are not the constituent units of the country but exist purely for the convenience of governmental administration.

According to Javad Naserian, the Ministry of Interior&#x27;s Management Development and Human Resources Vice-Minister, the purpose of this grouping of provinces was the creation of synergy, transfer of experience, information exchange, and regional development. Also, it now provides an intermediate level where provinces can discuss their problems among themselves, instead of going immediately to Tehran.

The intention was for each region to have regularly scheduled meetings of the constituent provinces&#x27; governors-general, rotating the meeting place through the provincial capitals. The host province would provide the chairman of each meeting. A regional secretariat would be established in the capital city of the main province of each region, with a coordinating bureau in the Ministry of Interior headquarters in Tehran.

==Historical regions==
In 1937 the territory of Iran was divided into ten administrative regions: , , , etc.() For example, or &quot;Seventh Province&quot; corresponded to present-day Fars province per the &quot;Territorial Subdivision Act of 1316 Š./1937 (Qānūn-e taqsīmāt-e kešvar).&quot;

Histories, travel books and economic analyses often refer to less formal, more historical or geographical, Iranian regions. The borders of these are not fixed and often have changed over time, and even overlapped at the same time.
* Alamut – in the Alborz mountain range of northern Iran;
* Central Iran: Known as &quot;Iraq-i Ajam (&quot;Persian Iraq)
* Baluchistan (Southeastern Iran) – sometimes just Sistan and Baluchestan province and sometimes all of Baluchistan;
* Caspian Iran (Northern Iran, Tabaristan or &quot;Mardi and Hyrcania&quot;) – Gilan province, Mazandaran province, and Golestan province, and historically sometimes northern Semnan
* Eastern Iran
* Iranian Azerbaijan – approximately the current provinces of Region 3, but often excluding Kurdistan province and often excluding the Caspian province of Gilan;
* Iranian Kurdistan – including Kurdistan province, Kermanshah province and parts of Ilam province and parts of West Azerbaijan province;
* Khorasan – consisting of North Khorasan province, Razavi Khorasan province, South Khorasan province, and sometimes eastern Semnan province
** Quhistan – southern Khorasan;
* Southern Iran (also known as the Persian Gulf region of Iran) – Fars, Kohgiluyeh and Buyer Ahmad, Hormozgan and Bushehr provinces;
* Southeastern Iran (Carmania) – mostly Kerman province, but often extending to the coast;
* Western Iran (Khuzestan, Elam) – the &#x27;birthplace of Iran&#x27;, similar to Region 4 (Hamadan province, Ilam province, Kermanshah province, Khuzestan province, Lorestan province, Markazi province), but often including all of or some of Qazvin province, Kurdistan province, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province and Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province;

<doc id="1244679" wikidata="Q31971" url="?curid=1244679" title="Reap the Wild Wind">
<text>Reap the Wild Wind is a 1942 American adventure film produced and directed by Cecil B. DeMille and starring Ray Milland, John Wayne, and Paulette Goddard, with a supporting cast featuring Raymond Massey, Robert Preston, Lynne Overman, Susan Hayward and Charles Bickford. DeMille&#x27;s second Technicolor production, the film is based on a serialized story written by Thelma Strabel in 1940 for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. The screenplay was written by Alan Le May (author of the novel &quot;The Searchers&quot;), Charles Bennett, Jesse Lasky, Jr. and Jeanie MacPherson.

While he based his film on Strabel&#x27;s story, set in the 1840s along the Florida coast, DeMille took liberties with details such as sibling relationships and subplots, while staying true to the spirit of the story, which centers on the headstrong, independent woman portrayed by Goddard.

Released shortly after the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, &quot;Reap the Wild Wind&quot; was wildly successful at the box office and earned three Academy Award nominations, winning for Best Special Effects.

==Plot==
In 1840, Loxi Claiborne is running a marine salvage business started by her deceased father. A hurricane is passing through the Key West area, leaving behind at least one wreck on the nearby shoals. The &quot;Jubilee&quot; founders, and Loxi and other salvagers race to claim the cargo. Not arriving first, Loxi and her crew rescue the captain, Jack Stuart, but do not share in the salvage rights. Apparently, the first salvager on the scene, King Cutler, may have actually planned the wreck.

Nursing Jack back to health, Loxi falls in love with him. When she visits Charleston with her cousin Drusilla, Loxi schemes to win a plum captain&#x27;s position for Jack by seducing Steve Tolliver, who is running the sailing ship line for which Jack works. Steve falls for Loxi and returns with her to Key West to investigate the truth about Jack&#x27;s shipwreck.

Drusilla goes home to Havana when Loxi and Steve return to Key West. Steve has come to rid the Keys of pirates like Cutler (and to be near Loxi). Cutler, in turn, arranges to have Steve shanghaied by the crew of a whaler. Loxi hears of the plot and gets Jack to help her save Steve. Later, they discover that Steve has concealed Jack&#x27;s appointment to the steamship &quot;Southern Cross&quot; on orders from his superior. Angry over a seemingly underhanded act, Jack meets with Cutler. He learns that Steve&#x27;s boss has just died and that Steve will be taking over the shipping line. Jack realizes that he is unlikely to keep his command with Steve in charge and agrees to work with Cutler to sabotage his new ship; he sails to Havana to take command.

Rumors circulate and prices of the cargo of the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; fluctuate wildly, leaving Steve to suspect a wreck is planned. He commandeers the &quot;Claiborne&quot; with Loxi on board and heads to Havana to stop Jack. Loxi, believing Jack is innocent, disables her ship, and they sit becalmed in a fog bank as the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; piles into a reef and sinks. Unknown to Jack, Drusilla had stowed away to be with her lover, King Cutler&#x27;s brother Dan, and she drowns.

Jack is put on trial for wrecking his ship. The testimony reveals a woman may have been on board, though none was rescued. To determine if a woman is in the wreck, Steve agrees to dive to the wreck with Jack. While down in the wreck, Jack and Steve discover proof that Drusilla was on board and has been drowned. They are attacked by a giant squid. Jack saves Steve&#x27;s life, but is lost when the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; slips off the continental shelf into deep water. Dan Cutler accuses his brother of murder and is shot dead by him, whereupon, Steve shoots King Cutler, killing him.

Loxi and Steve return to Charleston together.

==Production==
The film is unusual among films starring John Wayne since it is one of relatively few films in which he plays a character with a notable dark side, as well as accepting second billing under Milland. Wayne subsequently starred in a 1948 seafaring adventure titled &quot;Wake of the Red Witch&quot; which had numerous similarities to &quot;Reap the Wild Wind&quot;, including Wayne&#x27;s portrayal of an even darker character.

This film also marks the final appearance by Hedda Hopper as an actress in a significant role. The gossip columnist would, however, make cameo appearances in subsequent films.

Los Angeles architect William Pereira designed special effects for this film. Pereira, newly arrived from Chicago, had a brief stint as a Hollywood set designer and engineer prior to becoming a professor at the University of Southern California and later co-founding the architecture firm of Pereira &amp; Luckman.

<doc id="1244690" wikidata="Q5719091" url="?curid=1244690" title="Henry Cadogan, 4th Earl Cadogan">
<text>Henry Charles Cadogan, 4th Earl Cadogan PC (15 February 1812 – 8 June 1873), styled Viscount Chelsea between 1820 and 1864, was a British diplomat and Conservative politician. He served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard between 1866 and 1868.

==Background and education==
Cadogan was born at South Audley Street, Mayfair, London, the second but eldest surviving son of George Cadogan, 3rd Earl Cadogan, by his wife Honoria Louisa Blake, daughter of Joseph Blake. He was educated at Eton and Oriel College, Oxford.

==Diplomatic and political career==
Cadogan initially joined the Diplomatic Service and was an attaché in St Petersburg from 1834 to 1835. In 1841 he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Reading, a seat he held until 1847, and then represented Dover from 1852 to 1857.
 He then returned to the Diplomatic Service and served as Secretary of the Paris Embassy from 1858 to 1859. In 1864 he succeeded his father in the earldom and entered the House of Lords. When the Conservatives came to power under Lord Derby in 1866, Cadogan was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, a post he held until 1868, the last year under the premiership of Benjamin Disraeli.

Apart from his diplomatic and political careers, Lord Cadogan was the Colonel of the Royal Westminster Militia, appointed on 6 December 1841. On 13 March 1865 he became Honorary Colonel of the regiment.

==Family==
Lord Cadogan married Mary Sarah Wellesley, daughter of Valerian Wellesley, on 13 July 1836 in Durham Cathedral. They had four sons and two daughters. The Countess Cadogan died in February 1873, aged 65. Lord Cadogan only survived her by four months and died at Woodrising, Norfolk, in June 1873, aged 61. His eldest son George succeeded in the earldom.

<text>Victor Conte Jr. (born July 10, 1950) is an American musician and businessman who was the founder and president of Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), which is now defunct. BALCO was a sports nutrition center in California. In the late seventies Conte played bass with R&amp;B group Tower of Power, appearing on the band&#x27;s 1978 release &quot;We Came to Play!&quot;.

Conte served time in prison in 2005 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to distribute steroids and to money laundering. He currently operates Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning (SNAC Nutrition).

== Early life and music career ==
Victor Conte Jr. was born in 1950 in Fresno to Shirley and Victor Conte Sr. He is the oldest of three children in a working-class Italian family. After graduating from McLane High School he attended Fresno City College but dropped out of college in 1969 after being convinced by his cousin, musician Bruce Conte, to join the band Common Ground as its bass player. In 1970 he quit playing in Common Ground and joined the band Pure Food and Drug Act. 

At the time Conte&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Walking Fish&quot;, due to his unusual way of moving across the stage when he was performing. He left Pure Food and Drug Act some time prior to 1977. He was a member of Tower of Power from 1977 until 1979 playing bass guitar. He also collaborated during that period with pianist Herbie Hancock and violinist Sugarcane Harris.

== Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative ==

In 1984, Conte founded the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), a sports nutrition center first located in Millbrae, California and later relocated to Burlingame, California. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) says he developed the banned steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG has the nickname The Clear) with the help of bodybuilding chemist Patrick Arnold. Pursuant to a plea bargain struck with prosecutors, he entered guilty pleas in July 2005 to one count of conspiracy to distribute steroids and a second count of laundering a portion of a check. He was sentenced in October of the same year to four months in the federal Taft Correctional Institution in Taft, California, with four months on house arrest.

In a December 2004 interview with Martin Bashir on ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; program, he admitted to running doping programs which have broken Olympic records. He said, &quot;The whole history of the games is just full of corruption, cover-up, performance-enhancing drug use.&quot; In the interview he implicated five-time Olympic gold medalist Marion Jones and her partner Tim Montgomery, Kelli White (who later admitted using performance-enhancing drugs), sprinter Dwain Chambers, NFL linebacker Bill Romanowski, and others.

On December 21, 2006, Yahoo Sports reported that one of Conte&#x27;s initial defense lawyers, Troy Ellerman, had been targeted by the FBI as a possible source of leaks to the media during the Barry Bonds probe. On February 14, 2007, Ellerman pleaded guilty to leaking grand jury testimony. It was also reported that FBI agents were an additional source of leaks. In May 2007, Conte claimed to be again providing supplements for Dwain Chambers, who left track and field to play in the NFL Europa league for the Hamburg Sea Devils before returning to athletics in 2008. According to Conte, the nutritional supplements provided via his company Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning, are perfectly legal.

On December 13, 2007, Conte appeared on CNN before &quot;The Mitchell Report&quot; was officially released.

== Books ==
&quot;Game of Shadows: Barry Bonds, BALCO, and the Steroids Scandal that Rocked Professional Sports&quot; was published by two &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; investigative reporters in 2006, relating to the case. There have been controversies about the informant and/or source of the information about the books and related court cases.

In 2008, in the aftermath of the investigation, Conte wrote a book &quot;BALCO: The Straight Dope on Barry Bonds, Marion and What We Can Do to Save Sports&quot; which was co-written with author Nathan Jendrick. There was defamation litigation about the book&#x27;s publication by boxer Shane Mosley which delayed the publication date. Mosley dropped the lawsuit, but not before Skyhorse Publishing had been scared away from publishing it. The book is officially unpublished as of 2017, but the unpublished manuscript has been made available.

== Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning ==
In 2011, Conte started a new company, Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning (SNAC) which is based in San Carlos, California, which in addition to nutritional supplements also offers boxing and sports training. One of SNAC&#x27;s clients is boxer Zab Judah; Conte has previously worked with Andre Berto, Nonito Donaire, and Andre Ward.

<doc id="1244716" wikidata="Q17856012" url="?curid=1244716" title="Julian (given name)">
<text>Julian is a common male given name in the United States, Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands (as Juliaan), France (as &quot;Julien&quot;), Italy (as &quot;Giuliano&quot;), Russia [Iulian (Yulian)] Spain, Latin America (as &quot;Julián&quot; in Spanish and &quot;Juliano&quot; or &quot;Julião&quot; in Portuguese), &quot;Iulian&quot; in Romanian and elsewhere.

The name is based on the Roman name Julianus, which was derived from Julius. This was the name of the Roman emperor Julian (4th century). It was also borne by several early saints, including the legendary Saint Julian the Hospitaller. This name has been used in England since the Middle Ages, at which time it was also a feminine name (from Juliana, eventually becoming Gillian).

<doc id="1244718" wikidata="Q11620543" url="?curid=1244718" title="Parachute candidate">
<text>A parachute candidate, or carpetbagger in the United States, is a pejorative term for an election candidate who does not live in the area they are running to represent and has little connection to it. The allegation is thus that a desperate political party lacking reliable talent local to the district or region is &quot;parachuting&quot; the candidate in for the job or that the party (or the candidate themselves) wishes to give a candidate an easier election than would happen in their home area. The term also carries the implication that the candidacy has been imposed without regard to the existing local hierarchy.

==Australia==
===Australian Labor Party===
Due to its factions (Labor Left, Labor Right, and Independent Labor), Labor often has arrangements in place for preselections, which would often result in parachuting candidates.
* Anthony Byrne lived outside his electorate, Holt, in the neighbouring electorate of La Trobe.
* Jo Briskey is the incoming candidate for the Division of Maribyrnong at the 2025 Australian federal election to succeed Bill Shorten who announced his retirement on 5 September 2024. She had unsuccessfully contested for the Division of Bonner in Queensland and had only moved to Victoria to work for the United Workers Union.
* Andrew Charlton, a former adviser to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, was criticised for being parachuted into the Division of Parramatta to succeed retiring MP Julie Owens at the 2022 Australian federal election over local candidates who were from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Before the electoral campaign, Charlton resided in Sydney&#x27;s eastern suburbs in Bellevue Hill in a property worth over $A16 million and only purchased a property in the electorate once preselected.
* Mary Doyle: At the time of her preselections, Doyle didn&#x27;t live in the Division of Aston. Doyle lived in the suburb of Mitcham, located in the nearby Deakin electorate.
* Mark Dreyfus lives outside his electorate, Isaacs.
* Jane Garrett, a former minister in the First Andrews Ministry in Victoria, was parachuted into the number one position in the Eastern Victoria Region at the 2018 Victorian state election, a seat that future MP Daniel Mulino vacated to run for the Division of Fraser in Melbourne&#x27;s western suburbs. Garrett had been the MP for the electoral district of Brunswick, which was becoming increasingly marginal, and was criticised for her role in a dispute between the Country Fire Authority, the United Firefighters Union, and the state government in her capacity as Minister for Emergency Services.
* In 2004, musician and activist Peter Garrett was preselected as the Australian Labor Party&#x27;s candidate for the safe seat of Kingsford Smith at the federal election that year due to the intervention of leader Mark Latham, despite opposition from the local ALP branch, who labelled him an outsider. The CFMEU issued a statement criticising his selection as &quot;a pathetic version of political celebrity squares&quot;. Regardless, Garrett was elected to the House of Representatives.
* Mathew Hilakari, Labor&#x27;s candidate for the newly established electorate of Point Cook, was parachuted in for the 2022 Victorian state election. Hilakari, before pre-selection, was residing in Melbourne&#x27;s southeastern suburbs in Seaford. He is also the convenor for Labor&#x27;s Socialist Left faction (of which Premier Daniel Andrews is a part) in Victoria.
* Ged Kearney: As of 2018, Kearney didn&#x27;t live in her electorate, Batman at the time.
* Former Premier of New South Wales Kristina Keneally was preselected as Labor candidate for the 2017 Bennelong by-election. She lived 800 metres outside the electorate, which, combined with her high profile, attracted accusations of parachuting.
* Keneally sought preselection for the House of Representatives again in 2021, this time for the electorate of Fowler in western Sydney despite living in the city&#x27;s affluent northern suburbs. She was also criticised for making the move despite retiring member Chris Hayes having already endorsed local Vietnamese Australian lawyer Tu Le as his successor in a working-class, migrant-rich neighbourhood. With heavy publicity drawn toward what is normally one of the safest seats in Australian politics, Keneally suffered a massive swing against the previous result and lost the seat for Labor for the only time in its 13-election existence, with parts of the area being held as far back as 1934 when it was part of Werriwa. This resulted in a former Liberal Party member who turned independent, Vietnamese Australian and former refugee Dai Le, being elected.
* In 2013, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd asked Jason Yat-Sen Li to run as the Labor candidate for the seat of Bennelong at the 2013 federal election even though he did not live in the electorate. He lost the election.
* In 2007, journalist Maxine McKew was preselected as Labor candidate in the forthcoming federal election for Bennelong, represented by then-Prime Minister John Howard. McKew did not live in the electorate then, and sold her home in Mosman to move before the election. She went on to defeat Howard, becoming the first candidate to unseat a sitting prime minister in an election since 1929, when Jack Holloway defeated Stanley Bruce at Flinders.
* Daniel Mulino is the current MP for the Division of Fraser in Melbourne&#x27;s western suburbs. Mulino had previously been a member of the Victorian Legislative Council for the Eastern Victoria Region, a seat he vacated for Jane Garrett. Before his tenure in the Parliament of Victoria, Mulino was a councillor and mayor for the City of Casey. Mulino lived in the electorate of Fraser in the 2019 Australian federal election, in which he was elected.
* Clare O&#x27;Neil previously lived in East Melbourne, outside her electorate, Hotham, but bought a house in Oakleigh in 2020.
* In 2013, athlete Nova Peris was preselected as Labor&#x27;s leading candidate for the Senate in the Northern Territory. Peris was born and raised in the Northern Territory, but her selection was received with controversy due to her celebrity status and the personal intervention of leader and Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who described the selection as a &quot;captain&#x27;s pick&quot;.
* Maria Vamvakinou: she lived in Northcote, which lies outside her electorate, Calwell.

===Coalition===
* Despite representing Menzies for nearly thirty-one years, Kevin Andrews never lived there. He lived in neighbouring Jagajaga.
* Russell Broadbent: , Broadbent, the MP for Monash, and his wife lived outside his electorate in Pakenham, Victoria, in the Division of La Trobe.
* Georgina Downer was Liberal candidate for the electorate of Mayo in the 2018 by-election. Daughter of long-serving MP for Mayo Alexander Downer, Downer had grown up in the area and proclaimed that she was &quot;coming home&quot; in the by-election. However, she had lived most of her life in Adelaide and Melbourne and sought preselection for a seat in the latter during the 2016 election. She lost to Centre Alliance incumbent Rebekha Sharkie.
* Eric Hutchinson did not live in his electorate, Lyons, but in neighbouring Bass.
* In 2013, Liberal National Senator Barnaby Joyce was preselected as Nationals candidate for the New South Wales seat of New England. Joyce was raised in Tamworth, within the electorate, but had lived in Queensland for over twenty years and represented the state in the Senate since 2005.
* Former President of the Australian Labor Party Warren Mundine was a parachute candidate for the Liberal Party of Australia in the Division of Gilmore at the 2019 federal election to succeed retiring MP Ann Sudmalis. Prior to Mundine&#x27;s selection, the local party branches had preselected Grant Schultz, whose candidacy would eventually be overridden by the party&#x27;s state executive to select Mundine instead at the request of Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Fiona Phillips of the Australian Labor Party defeated Mundine: she received a two-party swing of 3.34 per cent while Schultz contested the electorate as an independent candidate, receiving 7,585 votes.
* After the resignation of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull from Parliament in 2018, Dave Sharma was preselected as the Liberal candidate in the resulting by-election at Wentworth. Sharma did not live in the electorate at the time. He narrowly lost the by-election, but successfully contested the seat again several months later in the 2019 federal election. In the 2022 federal general election, Independent candidate Allegra Spender defeated Sharma.
* Brett Whiteley did not live in his electorate of Braddon during the 2016 election campaign, but in neighbouring Lyons, at Squeaking Point near Port Sorell.
* Jason Wood, the MP for La Trobe, lives with his family in Mount Dandenong, approximately 11kms outside his electorate, in the Division of Casey.

==Canada==
===Federal===
* In the 2008 Canadian federal election, in Newfoundland and Labrador, the New Democratic Party nominated Phyllis Artiss, who lived in St. John&#x27;s, for the northern riding of Labrador. Artiss was nominated in the absence of any local candidate and admitted that she found her candidacy to be not ideal: &quot;It would be much better to have someone from Labrador who has lived there all their lives or much of their lives and worked there, and I haven&#x27;t done that.&quot; Artiss was unsuccessful in her bid.
* Former Prime Minister Joe Clark, an Albertan, was seen as a parachute candidate when he ran for election in the Nova Scotia riding of Kings—Hants at a by-election in 2000. Clark had been elected leader of the Progressive Conservatives for the second time in 1998 and was seeking a seat in the House of Commons; incumbent Tory MP Scott Brison had stepped aside for Clark. He was elected, but in the 2000 federal election, he instead sought election in the Alberta riding of Calgary Centre. He won in Calgary Centre, making it the only constituency to flip to the PCs.
* Chrystia Freeland faced accusations of being a parachute candidate after the Liberal Party nominated her for the safe seat of Toronto Centre at a 2013 by-election (which its former interim leader Bob Rae had represented), as she was born in rural northern Alberta and lived in New York City at the time. She ultimately won the seat.
* Kellie Leitch was accused of being a parachute candidate when she sought the Conservative nomination in the Ontario riding of Simcoe—Grey in 2011. Leitch was born in Winnipeg and worked in Toronto at the time of her nomination. Leitch won the seat over candidates including Helena Guergis, the former Conservative Member of Parliament whom she defeated for the nomination and who ran as an independent.
* In 2021, the Conservative Party nominated Lea Mollison for the riding of Northwest Territories. Mollison was a resident of Thunder Bay, Ontario, and reportedly never visited the Northwest Territories. Mollison&#x27;s campaign ignored local media requests, including an invitation to a candidates&#x27; forum, which drew widespread criticism.
* Lester B. Pearson, who was born and raised in Toronto, served as MP for Algoma East in rural Northwestern Ontario during his parliamentary career from 1948 to 1968. In his memoirs, Pearson admitted he did not have &quot;any earlier connection&quot; to the riding; Pearson had been seeking entry into the House of Commons, and the seat had been made vacant for him when Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King recommended that its sitting member, Thomas Farquhar, be appointed to the Senate. Pearson nevertheless won election eight times before retiring from Parliament, culminating in his premiership of five years.
* Jagmeet Singh, former Ontario MPP for Bramalea—Gore—Malton, faced accusations of being a parachute candidate when he stood at a by-election in Burnaby South, a riding in British Columbia. Singh had been elected leader of the NDP in 2017 but did not have a seat in the House of Commons (whereas his leadership opponents Charlie Angus, Niki Ashton, and Guy Caron were serving MPs) and stood in Burnaby South to gain one. Singh pledged to move to Burnaby if he won the by-election. Singh was ultimately successful in his bid, and held his seat in the general elections of 2019 and 2021.

===Provincial===
* Ernie Eves became the leader of the Ontario PCs and Premier of Ontario in 2002. He was called a parachute candidate when he ran for election in the safe Conservative seat of Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey instead of a constituency in Windsor, where he was born, or Parry Sound—Muskoka, which he had represented as MPP from 1981 until 1999.
* In New Brunswick, Liberal leader Susan Holt was accused of being a parachute candidate when she ran in the safe Liberal constituency of Bathurst East-Nepisiguit-Saint-Isidore in a 2023 by-election instead of any riding in Fredericton, where she was born and ran as a candidate in 2018 (she placed second in Fredericton South).
* Danielle Smith, current Premier of Alberta, was called a parachute candidate when she ran at a by-election in Brooks-Medicine Hat after winning the 2022 United Conservative Party leadership election instead of Highwood, the district she resides in and formerly represented as a Wildrose MLA.

===Municipal===
* In Ontario, Patrick Brown, who had previously been MP for Barrie and MPP for Simcoe North, was called a parachute candidate when he announced his campaign for Mayor of Brampton in 2018. Brown ultimately succeeded in his mayoral bid.

==France==

France has a long history of parachute candidates. Extreme examples have been candidates from mainland France who ran for election in overseas France. In 1963, Michel Debré was parachuted to the Indian Ocean island of Réunion nearly 6,000 miles away from the mainland, where he won a by-election and served as deputy for seventeen years. In the small North American territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, three candidates from the mainland have attempted to win its constituency seat since 2002, most recently Patricia Chagnon in 2024.

==Ireland==
* Avril Doyle stood for Fine Gael at the 2004 European elections in the Ireland East constituency, despite being from Dublin, and was considered a parachute candidate.
* George Lee was a successful parachute candidate for Fine Gael at the 2009 Dublin South by-election.
* Lorraine Mulligan was described as a parachute candidate when she stood for Labour at the 2014 Dublin West by-election, despite living in Dublin Central.
* Catherine Noone stood for Fine Gael in Dublin West at the 2016 general election; she later attempted to be &quot;parachuted&quot; in Dublin South-West before standing in Dublin Bay North at the 2020 general election.
* Sheila Nunan stood for the Labour Party at the 2019 European elections in the Ireland South constituency, despite living in Dublin. Her team replied that she lived near the border with County Wicklow and her parents are from County Kerry, both counties in the South constituency. Michael McNamara claimed that &quot;a parachute candidate could look like desperation. We [the Labour Party] need to be relevant and have relevant ideas for people in rural Ireland.&quot;
* Journalist Susan O&#x27;Keeffe was described as a parachute candidate by local candidate Veronica Cawley when she stood for Labour in Sligo–North Leitrim at the 2011 general election; O&#x27;Keeffe is a native of Dublin but lived in Sligo at the time.

==New Zealand==
In 2017, Deborah Russell won selection for the safe Labour seat of New Lynn, in West Auckland, despite being from Whangamōmona, a small town in the Manawatū-Whanganui region. She beat out Greg Presland, a New Lynn resident for 30 years who had the backing of the local members. However, Labour&#x27;s Council backed Russell because of her finance expertise and a pledge to have more women in electorates. Upon winning selection, Russell moved to the electorate. She was elected in the 2017 election and re-elected in 2020 before being defeated in the electorate in 2023.

==Taiwan==
Han Kuo-yu was a successful parachute candidate for Mayor of Kaohsiung at 2018 Taiwanese local elections. He has served previously on the Taipei County Council and as a member of Legislative Yuan elected by Taipei County.

==United Kingdom==
Parachute candidates are common in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Westminster system historically emphasizes party discipline over responsiveness to constituencies. For example, Margaret Thatcher, who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for over eleven years, represented Finchley during her parliamentary career despite living in Chelsea, London. As far back as the 1900s, the then-dominant Liberal Party were parachuting candidates from England into safe seats in Scotland, including Winston Churchill, elected MP for Dundee in 1908. This led to a formal protest movement, called Young Scots, arguing that objections to carpet-baggers were based on a lack of understanding of the political will of their constituents on matters like Home Rule.

A 2013 YouGov survey found that support for a hypothetical candidate rose by 12 points after voters learned that his opponent had moved to the area two years earlier and by 30 points if the opponent lived 120 miles away. The percentage of local MPs rose, according to Michael Rush of the University of Exeter, from 25% in 1979 to 45% in 1997; Ralph Scott of Demos calculates that 63% are local. According to surveys, public trust in all MPs has decreased, but trust in the local MP has increased, making pre-existing connections to seats more critical. Election advertisements emphasize local connections more than they mention the candidate&#x27;s party or its leader. Such a change produces MPs who are more attentive to local issues, but may be detrimental to Britain&#x27;s first-past-the-post voting system designed to create broad parties that party whips stabilize.
===Labour Party===
* Luciana Berger was a middle-class Londoner parachuted into the north-western working-class safe Labour seat of Liverpool Wavertree. She was heavily criticised for having no connection to the Wavertree constituency or Liverpool when she first ran in 2010. When a local radio station asked her basic questions about the culture of Liverpool, she could not answer them and, during the selection process, she stayed at the house of retiring local MP Jane Kennedy rather than resettle in the area. Some figures in the media suggested that she was only selected for the seat because of her close connections to the family of former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Berger won the seat in 2010 with a slightly larger majority than Kennedy had in 2005, against the national trend, then retained it in 2015 and 2017. After joining the Liberal Democrats in 2019, she unsuccessfully contested the Greater London seat of Finchley and Golders Green at the 2019 general election. She chose to stand there because of the seat&#x27;s large Jewish population and Remain vote, as well as her affinity towards living in London and choice to raise her children there rather than in Liverpool.
* Roy Jenkins was so unfamiliar with Glasgow, he later wrote, that on his arrival to campaign at the 1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election its skyline was &quot;as mysterious to me as the minarets of Constantinople&quot; to Russian troops during the Russo-Turkish War. Campaigning as a Social Democrat, Jenkins won the election, taking the seat from the Scottish Conservatives.
* David and Ed Miliband were selected to fight safe Labour seats in northern England, South Shields and Doncaster North respectively, despite being Oxford graduates who were born, raised, and living in London while working as political advisers. David was elected for the first time in 2001, and Ed in 2005. Both would later serve as ministers under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and fight against each other in the 2010 party leadership election.
*Shaun Woodward, who was first elected as a Conservative MP in 1997, defected to the Labour Party in 1999. He faced much criticism from former Conservative colleagues, particularly when he refused to resign and fight a by-election. In 2001, Woodward did not contest his safe Conservative seat of Witney in Oxfordshire, instead being selected for the similarly ultra-safe Labour seat of St Helens South in Merseyside. During the early days of the 2001 general election campaign, Labour minister Chris Mullin wrote in his diary on 11 May about &quot;speculation about which members of the New Labour elite will be parachuted into one of the safe seats being vacated by MPs retiring at the last moment.&quot; On 14 May, Mullin described Woodward&#x27;s selection at St Helens as &quot;one of New Labour&#x27;s vilest stitch-ups&quot; and wrote that listening to him campaigning as a Labour candidate &quot;made my flesh creep.&quot;

===Conservative Party===
* Prior to the 2024 general election, Richard Holden, who was serving as the Chairman of the Conservative Party, represented the marginal seat of North West Durham, which he won in the 2019 general election with a slender 2.4% majority. His seat was abolished by the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies and he was later selected for the safe Conservative seat of Basildon and Billericay after the Conservative Party imposed him as the candidate against local opposition; Holden was the only contender allowed to stand on the shortlist. This led to accusations of carpetbagging, especially after it emerged that, in January 2024, he described himself as &quot;bloody loyal to the north-east&quot;, and denied he would seek a safer seat. Ironically, Holden went on to win by a mere twenty votes.
* Boris Johnson&#x27;s selection for the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Henley in 2001, after the party&#x27;s central office parachuted him in, was described by senior local Tory Mike McInnes as &quot;a disaster for the integrity of modern politics&quot; and &quot;arrogant in the extreme&quot;, Johnson having &quot;blustered in with no knowledge about the constituency&quot;. McInnes commented that he could not see him supporting a hypothetical local old lady who was having problems with her housing benefit and asked, &quot;Are people going to feel comfortable going to him?&quot; Likewise, Johnson&#x27;s main rival, Liberal Democrat candidate Catherine Bearder, gave him a withering assessment. She said: &quot;In Henley, you can put a blue rosette on a donkey and it will get elected. And that&#x27;s what happened in 2001... He clearly just wanted to be an MP. As soon as London came up, he was off out.&quot;

===Minor parties===
* Douglas Carswell defected from the Conservatives to the UK Independence Party in 2014, in turn displacing the existing UKIP candidate for the forthcoming general election in his constituency of Clacton. As Carswell was living in London then, the former UKIP candidate accused him of carpetbagging.
* George Galloway was expelled from Labour in 2003 over Iraq War-related controversies and, despite previously representing Glasgow Kelvin, stood for the Respect Party in the Greater London constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow at the 2005 general election, where he used his opposition to the war and the local Muslim population to gain the seat from Labour. Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy said he was a carpetbagger who had whipped up racial tensions. After standing down from Bethnal Green and Bow in 2010, he stood for Respect at a 2012 by-election in the West Yorkshire seat of Bradford West, another constituency with a high local Muslim population. Galloway made a point of not drinking alcohol and again gained the seat from Labour. He lost Bradford West in 2015 to Labour&#x27;s Naz Shah. As an independent, he unsuccessfully contested Manchester Gorton in 2017 and West Bromwich East in 2019. He attempted to be selected as the Brexit Party candidate in the Cambridgeshire seat of Peterborough in a 2019 by-election but the party selected local businessman Mike Greene. Having formed the Workers Party of Britain, Galloway returned to parliament at the 2024 Rochdale by-election in which there were a variety of problems with the major-party candidates and he ran a campaign critical of Israel over its role in the Israel–Hamas war.
* In 1974, Enoch Powell left the Conservative Party and joined the Ulster Unionists, becoming the Westminster MP for South Down, despite having no Ulster connections. In 2002, when ex-Tory MP Andrew Hunter (who had family and Orange Order connections with Northern Ireland) joined the Democratic Unionist Party, the UUP accused him of being a carpet-bagger. It was pointed out the criticism was &quot;a little hollow&quot; considering the UUP&#x27;s prior acceptance and promotion of Powell.

==United States==
===U.S. Senate===
* Scott Brown was the unsuccessful Republican nominee in the 2014 United States Senate election in New Hampshire, despite having represented Massachusetts in the Senate just two years prior. Brown&#x27;s family had previously resided in New Hampshire, however, and he owned a vacation home in the state.
* First Lady of the United States Hillary Clinton was elected in the 2000 United States Senate election in New York after buying a house in Chappaqua in 1999. Born in Illinois, Clinton had previously lived in Arkansas and Washington, D.C.; she served as a senator until she resigned in 2009 to become United States Secretary of State.
* Former United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy was elected to the U.S. Senate in New York in 1964, serving from 1965 until his death on June 6, 1968. He had previously resided in his home state of Massachusetts. His opponents accused Kennedy of merely using the state as a convenient launching pad for the presidency.
* Alan Keyes, a resident of Maryland, was the unsuccessful Republican nominee in the 2004 Illinois United States Senate election. Notably, he had previously run unsuccessfully for the Senate in Maryland in 1988 and 1992.
* Mehmet Oz moved from Cliffside Park, New Jersey to Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, several months prior to the primary of the 2022 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania.
* Mitt Romney was elected to the U.S. Senate in Utah in 2018, though he was born in Michigan, resided in Massachusetts during the 2012 United States presidential election, and served as the governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
* Eli Crane was elected in 2022 to serve as the U.S. representative for Arizona&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, while he resides in Oro Valley, which is in Arizona&#x27;s 1st congressional district. The majority of Crane&#x27;s district is on the northern side of Arizona, while he resides in the southern areas of the state.
* Trey Hollingsworth moved from Tennessee to Indiana in September 2015. He ran as a Republican to represent Indiana&#x27;s 9th congressional district in the House of Representatives, and won the election in 2016.
* Alex Mooney, a former member of the Maryland Senate and former chairman of the Maryland Republican Party, moved to West Virginia in 2013 after previously exploring a run in Maryland&#x27;s 6th congressional district. Less than two years after moving, he was elected in the 2014 general election to represent West Virginia&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. Mooney unsuccessfully ran for the US Senate seat held by Senator Joe Manchin.
* Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokeswoman, moved from Florida to Tennessee only months before announcing her candidacy for the 2022 Republican primary in Tennessee&#x27;s 5th congressional district. Ortagus was ultimately disqualified due to the Tennessee Republican Party&#x27;s bylaws requiring candidates to have voted in three of the last four Tennessee Republican primaries.

Nick Lalota, current representative of New York’s 1st congressional district, lives in NY’s 2nd congressional district despite promises made before the election to move.

==Reception==
A Cash Box Magazine album review dated June 7, 1975 states &quot;One of the major factors behind Three Dog Night&#x27;s rise to the top of the pop heap has been their almost uncanny ability of giving new life and stature to other people&#x27;s songs. This mastery of other people&#x27;s material continues on Coming Down Your Way as the Dog&#x27;s put their own brand of pop polish on the likes of Randy Newman&#x27;s “You Can Leave Your Hat On&quot; and Allen Toussaint&#x27;s &quot;Mind Over Matter”. Chuck Negron&#x27;s gritty vocals on the disk&#x27;s title track proves a musical as do the same on &quot;Til The World Ends&quot;. Three Dog Night&#x27;s Coming Down Their Way; there isn&#x27;t a dog in this musical litter.&quot;

Another Cash Box Magazine &quot;Picks of The Week&quot; singles review page dated June 28, 1975 states the following about &quot;Til the World Ends&quot;, the single released off the album: &quot;With classically-inspired string arrangements by Jimmie Haskell leading off, the incomparable vocal stylings of a very new Three Dog changes musical directions and overall sound with a very straightforward love ballad. Lush orchestrations and production complexity make this an interesting prospect for the summer months.&quot;

A Billboard magazine Top Album Picks page dated June 7, 1975 gives another view: &quot;Say what you will, there is no other group who can tackle as many diverse styles in one LP and do them as well as Three Dog. Working with producer Jimmy lenner (Grand Funk) and associate producer Bob Monaco (Rufus) the band takes on Randy Newman, Allen Toussaint, Dave Loggins, Jeff Barry and Daniel Moore among others and comes up with creditable renditions of the material of each. Songs are heavily keyboard based when uptempo songs are taken on and string oriented on the ballads, which tend to be more effective than the rockers. Somehow, the wilder material seems a bit strained and contrived while the slower tunes work both vocally and instrumentally. Strongest lead vocals come from Chuck Negron, who appears most at home with both ballads and rockers. Nothing overly original here, but the group has never claimed that skill. It is interpretations that they have always shone, and this is where they shine once more. Best cuts: &quot;&#x27;Til The World Ends&quot;, &quot;Good Old Feeling&quot;, &quot;Coming Down Your Way&quot;, &quot;When It&#x27;s Over&quot;, &quot;Yo Te Quiero Hablar (Take You Down)&quot;. One of America&#x27;s few supergroups.&quot;

<doc id="1244744" wikidata="Q4659468" url="?curid=1244744" title="A Short History of Pakistan">
<text>A Short History of Pakistan is an edited book published by University of Karachi Press and comprises four volumes. The book is edited by Prof Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi and provides a comprehensive account of the history of the Pakistan region and its people from the prehistory leading to the creation of Pakistan and East Pakistan which then became Bangladesh. Complete set of four volumes are sequentially titled as, &quot;Book One: Pre-Muslim Period by Ahmad Hasan Dani&quot;; &quot;Book Two: Muslim Rule under the Sultans by M. Kabir&quot;; &quot;Book Three: The Mughul Empire by Sh. A. Rashid&quot;; and, &quot;Book Four: Alien Rule and the Rise of Muslim Nationalism by M. A. Rahim et al.&quot;

This book is significant as probably the first serious attempt to paint an overall picture of the early history of Pakistan region. Given that the book deals with periods of history prior to the creation of Pakistan, it has been described as, point of fact, a history of the northern part of the entire Indian subcontinent with special emphasis on the region that presently is Pakistan.
Some of the essays have been criticised by peer reviewers as being insufficiently objective about relations between Indian Muslims, Hindus and the British political classes.

== Preamble ==
At the preface, I H Qureshi addresses the common question as to whether it is possible to disentangle the history of Pakistan from the history of India. He maintains that although for certain periods Pakistan shares common history with modern day India, there are periods of regional history with local significance that were actually dominated by the events outside the South Asia, especially in Central Asia and Iranian plateau. There have also been times when the region actually became arbiter of the South Asia&#x27;s historical destiny.

== Critiques on four volumes ==

=== Book One: Pre-Muslim Period by A.H. Dani ===
Critique by Arthur Llewellyn Basham: Author of the first volume, Prof A. H. Dani is not only an expert archaeologist and prehistorian, but also an able Sanskrit scholar with a very important study of Indian palaeography to his credit. Its interest for the non-Pakistani reader lies chiefly in the attempt to find common factors in the ancient culture of what is now Pakistan. Although a great treasure of ancient Buddhist artefacts is discovered, no significant specimen of Mauryan Empire and Mauryan art is to be found in Pakistan. Gupta Empire also had little influence here. The book has been praised by Basham as &quot;a work which no sensible Pakistani or Indian could object to or accuse of undue prejudice&quot;

=== Book Two: Muslim Rule under the Sultans by M. Kabir ===
Critique by Philip B. Calkins: This volume gives a survey of the history of the Sultanate period. After an introductory chapter which describes some of the sources for the history of the period, nine chapters are devoted to an account of the Sultanate, its Muslim antecedents in Sindh and Afghanistan, and the independent Muslim kingdoms which developed out of it. The final chapter deals with administration, society and culture. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this volume is historiographical rather than historical, since it is part of a series of Pakistan and Muslims since their arrival in the sub-continent. Calkins, calls for a more deeper analysis of the history than presented in this volume. Despite the apparent image of &quot;the official Pakistani point of view&quot; intended to be used as textbook for undergraduate students, the volume should have been able to offer more for those who desire more rudimentary knowledge of sultanate period. He praises the particular aspect of the book as &quot;historigraphical rather than historical&quot;.

=== Book Three: The Mughal Empire by Sh. A. Rashid ===
Critique by Fritz Lehman: Given that this book is intended as a textbook for Pakistani undergraduates, Shaikh Ahmed Sarhindi predictably appears as the chief preserver of separate Islamic identity in India, yet only a very general and most inadequate description of his ideas and his influence is given. Chapters on Akbar and Aurangzib are the longest and the most revealing. The tone of the book in general is more reasonable and moderate than such earlier publications. Assessment of the Marathas, for example, while unsympathetic is fair to the facts.

Lehman criticises the volume&#x27;s implications that Muslims living under &quot;Hindu rule&quot; was &quot;the worst disaster in the history of Islam in South Asia&quot;, a view he describes as &#x27;consistent with the Two-Nation Theory&#x27;, but one that he finds &quot;disquieting&quot;.

=== Book Four: Alien Rule and the Rise of Muslim Nationalism by M. A. Rahim et al. ===
Critique by Aziz Ahmed: Determination of national identity quite understandably tends to be re-evaluation of history. The educator&#x27;s job is to make such re-evaluation available to the university student. It needs further analysis whether the Hindu officials of the Bengal Nawwabs conspired with the East India Company because they were Hindus or because, like Muslim officials, they were simply greedy.

Ahmad criticises this volume as a &quot;warped subjectivity&quot;, and the portrayal of British rule in the region as &quot;merely the lesser weakness of Rahim&#x27;s historical presentation. His greater weakness is a complete lack of objectivity&quot;. According to the reviewer, the book portrays Hindus and the British as &quot;villains&quot; and Muslims as &quot;victims&quot;. He further writes that the narrative is &quot;dangerous&quot; for it will not guide younger historians in Pakistan towards proper national self-criticism.

Asimov comments in that limerick&#x27;s introduction that “&quot;This one marked the beginning. I composed it on the Queen Elizabeth II when returning from a visit to Great Britain in June 1974. When I recited it, everyone laughed. Since that time I have been writing down limericks. I wasn&#x27;t going to let myself forget them and lose laughs.&quot;”

<text>The Young Snakes were an American rock band formed in Boston in the early 1980s.

The lead singer and bassist, Aimee Mann, formed the group after she dropped out of Berklee College of Music along with the guitarist and singer Doug Vargas and the drummer Dave Bass Brown. Brown left the band in the fall of 1981 to help form the Boston hardcore punk band Negative FX, and was replaced by the former D Club drummer Mike Evans.

After releasing the song &quot;Brains and Eggs&quot; on the Modern Method compilation &quot;A Wicked Good Time&quot;, the band released a five-song EP, 1982’s &quot;Bark Along with The Young Snakes&quot;, on Ambiguous Records. The compilation album &quot;Aimee Mann &amp; the Young Snakes&quot;, released in 2004, included &quot;Brains and Eggs&quot; and a radio performance, but not the &quot;Bark Along&quot; tracks.

Mann was unhappy in the band, saying the other members objected to her writing love songs or music they considered too melodic.

<text>The 1996 Major League Soccer season was the inaugural season of Major League Soccer. It was the 84th season of FIFA-sanctioned soccer in the United States, and the 18th with a national first-division league.

==Overview==

===Preparation for first season===
Major League Soccer had originally intended to begin competitive action in 1995. Various difficulties forced the league to postpone its first season until 1996. In preparation for its first season, the league began signing what it called marquee players, 
 beginning with Tab Ramos on January 3, 1995. Beginning in October 1995, the league apportioned the marquee players in the MLS Inaugural Allocations. Each team received two national team and two foreign players in the allocation. The league then invited about 250 players to a tryout the second week of January 1996 on the campus of UC Irvine. On February 6 and 7, 1996, the league held its 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft in which the ten teams selected 160 players over sixteen rounds. The Columbus Crew selected Brian McBride with the first pick of the draft. On March 4, 1996, the league then held the 1996 MLS College Draft followed by the 1996 MLS Supplemental Draft later that day. Despite the numerous drafts, the teams were not obligated to sign only players from the drafts.

===Preseason===
The preseason began the first week of March. The teams reduced their rosters to twenty-two players by March 25 and had to make a final roster reduction to eighteen by April 15. The teams had a $1,200,000 salary cap with no player allowed to receive more than $192,500. In order to promote American players, teams were limited to five foreigners on the roster.

===Season===
Each of the 10 MLS teams played 32 games. A regulation win was worth three points, a shootout win one point, and zero points for a loss in any manner. Fear of alienating fans with tied games had led the league to adopting the shootout when games ended even. The league also adopted a countdown clock instead of running clock, unlike IFAB&#x27;s standards. The league also divided the teams equally into two conferences – Eastern and Western.

The league began its first season on Saturday, April 6, 1996, when the San Jose Clash hosted D.C. United at Spartan Stadium. ESPN carried the game live which the Clash won on a goal by Eric Wynalda. That goal was selected as the Goal of the Year. The regular season ended on September 22. The playoffs began two days later.

<text>American Pastime is the fourteenth and final album by American rock band Three Dog Night, released in 1976.

==Background==
It is the band&#x27;s most recent studio album (as of 2019) and the only one not to feature the founding vocalists (Chuck Negron, Cory Wells, and Danny Hutton) backed up by their long-time band, with some exceptions. It sold poorly and the band broke up in August 1976. Michael Allsup and Floyd Sneed had left the band in late 1974 to form their own group SS Fools, with former Three Dog Night member Joe Schermie, Stan Seymore, Wayne DeVillier, Bobby Kimball, and Jon Smith, to little success. Danny Hutton was fired from TDN in late 1975, and was not present for any of the recording. &quot;Mellow Down&quot;, the song Hutton sings lead on, was recorded long before the album was released, and is likely an extra track from a previous album, such as &quot;Coming Down Your Way&quot; or &quot;Hard Labor&quot;. He was replaced by Jay Gruska.

==Track listing==
#&quot;Everybody&#x27;s a Masterpiece&quot; (George Clinton, Richard Ira Reicheg) – 2:45

==Reception==
A &quot;Cash Box&quot; Magazine album review dated April 10, 1976, states &quot;American Pastime takes Three Dog Night in a new direction featuring a collection of tunes ranging from slick production cuts to the ever popular disco beat. Vocals are as clean and distinctive as ever, leaning toward a meticulous pop production. AM programmers will find &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; and &quot;Southbound&quot; prime pop cuts, while &quot;Drive On, Ride On&quot; and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s A Masterpiece&quot; should appeal to the growing disco market. Some cuts (witness &quot;Easy Evil&quot;) will work nicely in easy listening and MOR areas.&quot;

Another Record World &quot;Album Picks&quot; review page dated April 17, 1976 gives another view on the album: &quot;This one may come as a surprise to the group&#x27;s older fans. The mix still focuses on vocal harmonies but the songs are r&amp;b and disco for the most part. &quot;Hang On&quot;, &quot;Mellow Down&quot; and &quot;Everybody Is A Masterpiece&quot; are pacesetters, the rhythm section rising in importance as the American pastime continues to dance.&quot;

Another &quot;Cash Box&quot; Magazine &quot;Picks of The Week&quot; singles reviews page dated June 5, 1976 states the following about &quot;Everybody&#x27;s a Masterpiece&quot;, the single released off the album: &quot;A laid-back rock hymn to humanity, this is an intelligent single from Three Dog Night that will serve to broaden its already extensive audience. The instrumentation — particularly the organ fills — is lush, and the vocals are equal to the task. Look for this to show up strong on all pop radio outlets; it&#x27;s really an affecting tune.&quot;

Another Record World &quot;Single Picks&quot; review page dated June 5, 1976, gives another view on the single: &quot;Three Dog Night&#x27;s vocal prowess remains unquestioned with this, their first effort in some time. To back up its talent, the group has constructed a solid rhythmic pulse and is headed for pop/r&amp;b play.&quot;

<text>Hong Kong Stadium is the main sports venue of Hong Kong. Redeveloped from the original Government Stadium, it reopened as Hong Kong Stadium in March 1994. It has a maximum seating capacity of 40,000, including 18,260 at the main level, 3,173 at executive level, 18,510 upper-level seats and 57 seats for wheelchair users.

The stadium is located in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong Island, in valley of Caroline Hill. Most international football matches held in Hong Kong are held at this stadium. Between 1982 and 2024, it hosted the Hong Kong Sevens annually. Hong Kong Stadium has also hosted the Rugby World Cup Sevens twice, in 1997 and 2005. The stadium is home to the Hong Kong national football team and hosts international matches for Hong Kong Premier League club side Kitchee SC.

==History==
So Kon Po was formerly the burial ground for the 1918 Fire at Happy Valley Racecourse. Then the Hong Kong Government moved all the tombs to Aberdeen. The old Government Stadium was a U-shaped constructed by 1953 and had a capacity of 28,000 with partially covered seating.

The old Government Stadium was only partially covered, without sufficient seats or lighting systems. In the 90s, the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club proposed a reconstruction plan so that Hong Kong can have a world class sports stadium.

In 2008, 39,000 people attended the first Bledisloe Cup rugby union match between Australia and New Zealand. In 2010, 26,210 people attended the second Bledisloe Cup rugby union game at the Hong Kong Stadium.

===1994 Re-construction and Wembley International===
In the early 1990s, the Government Stadium was reconstructed into a 40,000-seat rectangular stadium. No running track was built due to the restricted land size. This forced the schools to look for alternative venues.

The stadium&#x27;s management contract was won by Wembley International, a foreign subsidiary of Wembley Stadium, against strong competition, in March 1994.

From the first day there have been serious problems with the pitch. The owners of the stadium, the Urban Council, were disappointed. It came under fire from local football officials, sports promoters and even Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who said, before the exhibition match between Manchester United and South China AA on 20 July 1997, &quot;The pitch is cutting up. The surface is just sand-based and the turf doesn&#x27;t hold well. Injuries can occur.&quot;

The government had hoped that the stadium could be used as a music concert venue in order to bring in more rental income. But nearby citizens complained endlessly about &#x27;noise levels&#x27;, leading to restrictions on noise levels that effectively rendered the stadium unsuitable for concerts. This reduced greatly the income levels of the stadium and the management company, Wembley, ran into financial troubles.

===1998 Hong Kong government takeover===
Wembley&#x27;s management tenure at the stadium was abruptly terminated by the Provisional Urban Council (PUC) on 26 May 1998. PUC also asked Urban Services Department (USD) to assume temporary management of the Hong Kong Stadium and has also agreed to USD&#x27;s proposals to return the entire pitch of the Hong Kong Stadium. The fundamental issue between the parties was the care and maintenance of the stadium pitch, but also a complaint about an unauthorized bungy jump by Canadian Paul G. Boyle.

In the end, the Hong Kong government was judged to have wrongfully terminated the management agreement and had to pay over HK$20million in damages to Wembley Plc.

Hong Kong Stadium is now managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of Hong Kong, after the Urban Council was disbanded.

== Football ==
=== Full house ===
The first full house official football match (i.e. non-exhibition match) at the Hong Kong Stadium was the 2009 AFC Cup semi-final second leg between South China AA and Kuwait SC. This was added to in the same year by the 2009 East Asian Games football final between Hong Kong U23 and Japan U23. Although there were empty seats in the stadium, all tickets were sold or distributed.

===Hong Kong First Division League===
South China and Kitchee had used the sports ground as the home stadium in 2009–10 season.

Starting from 2010–11 season, only South China use the Hong Kong Stadium as their home stadium.

=== Lunar New Year Cup ===
The ground has hosted matches of the Lunar New Year Cup.

=== Hong Kong vs Real Madrid ===
Luis Figo scored the first goal for Real Madrid from the penalty spot after Roberto Carlos was brought down in the area during the pre-season friendly match against Hong Kong select XI at the Hong Kong Stadium on 8 August 2003. Real Madrid won the match 4–2.

=== Premier League Asia Trophy ===
The ground has hosted the Premier League Asia Trophy for four times, including the 2007, 2011, 2013 and 2017 edition, more than any other stadium.

===Kitchee vs Manchester City===
On 24 July 2019, the Hong Kong Stadium held a club friendly match between Premier League champions Manchester City and Hong Kong Premier League club Kitchee. where Manchester City won 6–1.

== Rugby ==
Since 1982 to 2024, the annual Hong Kong Sevens tournament was hosted at Hong Kong Stadium. The stadium has also hosted the Rugby World Cup Sevens twice, in 1997 and 2005.

On 1 November 2008, the ground became the first stadium outside of Australia or New Zealand to host a Bledisloe Cup test match. New Zealand&#x27;s All Blacks won the match, defeating Australia&#x27;s Wallabies 19–14.

On 1 June 2013, the British and Irish Lions and Barbarian F.C. played a rugby union match at the Hong Kong Stadium.

== Hong Kong International Cricket Sixes ==
The ground has hosted matches of the Hong Kong International Cricket Sixes since 1996 to 1997.

==2009 East Asian Games==
The stadium was used as the final venue for both the Rugby 7s and Football tournaments of the 2009 East Asian Games. Hong Kong&#x27;s rugby 7s team and football team both made the final against Japan. The rugby 7s team finished second to Japan. While the football team defeated them in front of over 31,000 spectators, including Donald Tsang, winning the Hong Kong football team&#x27;s first ever international title.

== 2013 muddy turf fiasco ==
In 2013, during the Barclays Asia Trophy, Sunderland manager Paolo Di Canio described the pitch as &quot;a killer&quot;, while Manchester City centre-back Matija Nastasić is injured on the mudheap pitch, although Nastasić&#x27;s injury was caused by a kick to the ankle according to City manager Manuel Pellegrini, who refused to blame the muddy pitch. Tottenham Hotspur manager André Villas-Boas was also critical of the pitch after Jan Vertonghen, a first-choice Spurs defender, incurred an ankle injury playing on the surface. &quot;If I can be sincere, I would prefer not to play, but this is the reality that we have to face,&quot; said the Portuguese on the eve of his side&#x27;s friendly against South China AA. Manchester United then cancelled their public training session at the stadium on Sunday amid concerns over the playing surface, did not want to further damage the playing surface or risk any injuries to their players, ahead of their exhibition match with Kitchee SC on 29 July.

On 30 July, the director of leisure and cultural services, Betty Fung Ching Suk-yee said returfing the much-criticised Hong Kong Stadium pitch is being considered, after football fans worldwide slammed the sodden, muddy surface during Barclays Asia Trophy matches on 24 and 27 July. South China FC chairman Steven Lo said in an official blog that recent matches have exposed a serious management problem. Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said he has asked the Home Affairs Bureau and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department for short, medium and long-term remedies.

In 2015, with support from the Jockey Club, the pitch was completely returfed. The existing turf and soil was removed, the irrigation and drainage systems replaced, and new turf laid.

==Non-sports events==
Jean-Michel Jarre held a concert at the Hong Kong Stadium on 11 March 1994. It was the first event after the re-construction of the Hong Kong Stadium.

Alan Tam held a concert at the Hong Kong Stadium from 22 to 24 April 1994. It was the first local artist held here.
The only time the venue is used for live events is the Extravaganza of China Olympic Gold Medallists celebration show for the Chinese gold medallists.

Bon Jovi played a concert at the stadium on 25 September 1993 during I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead Tour. It was their first concert in Hong Kong.

Canadian Paul G. Boyle illegally bungy jumped from the roof of the Hong Kong Stadium on the morning of Friday 24 May 1996. He was not arrested but was given a lifetime ban from all Urban Council facilities.

==Future==
At the 2013 Policy Address, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said once the Kai Tak Stadium is operational in 2019, the Hong Kong Stadium will be turned into a 10,000 capacity district sports arena.

==Facilities==
Hong Kong Stadium can accommodate 40,000. The spread is as below:
* 18,256 at Main level
* 18,507 at Upper levels
* 3,153 at Executive levels
* 57 wheelchair spaces

In addition, there are many refreshment kiosks inside the stadium.

==Other use==

The stadium was supposed to be a multi purpose entertainment and sports venue, due to its much greater capacity compared to the other popular and over used Hong Kong Coliseum, where nearly all uses are now strictly for popular entertainment. However, its open-air nature has led to noise complaints from residents in tower blocks surrounding the stadium. It has not been allowed to host entertainment events since 1999.

==Critical reception==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes, &quot;There isn&#x27;t anything major missing, and while some of the non-singles material isn&#x27;t particularly strong, there are enough worthwhile moments to make this a fairly consistent, enjoyable listen, in addition to being the one Three Dog Night album most fans will need.&quot;

<doc id="1244808" wikidata="Q2945513" url="?curid=1244808" title="Centre for Addiction and Mental Health">
<text>The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH, pronounced , ) is a psychiatric teaching hospital located in Toronto and ten community locations throughout the province of Ontario, Canada. It reports being the largest research facility in Canada for mental health and addictions. The hospital was formed in 1998 from the amalgamation of four separate institutions – the Queen Street Mental Health Centre, the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, the Addiction Research Foundation, and the Donwood Institute. It is Canada&#x27;s largest mental health teaching hospital, and the only stand-alone psychiatric emergency department in Ontario. CAMH has 90 distinct clinical services across inpatient, outpatient, day treatment, and partial hospitalization models. CAMH has been the site of major advancements in psychiatric research, including the discovery of the Dopamine receptor D2.

== History ==
CAMH was formed from the 1998 merger of the Queen Street Mental Health Centre with the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, Addiction Research Foundation, and Donwood Institute.

===Queen Street Mental Health Centre===

The Provincial Lunatic Asylum opened on 26 January 1850. It was subsequently renamed Asylum for the Insane, then Hospital for the Insane, then Ontario Hospital (1919), and then the Queen Street Mental Health Centre (1966). It had also been called the Toronto Lunatic Asylum and 999 Queen Street West.

The original buildings were constructed in a series of rigid lines and sharp angles, consistent with the belief at the time that orderly physical structure would facilitate orderly mental states for the patients. High walls segregated the patients from the community, establishing a long-standing stigma about the facility.

The Queen Street Site of CAMH contained the Samuel A. Malcolmson Lecture Theatre, named for the site&#x27;s Chief Psychiatrist and Clinical Director of Forensics. In 2009, however, Malcolmson was subject to a disciplinary hearing of Ontario&#x27;s College of Physicians and Surgeons, following that he sexually abused a patient and fathered a child with her. Malcomson pleaded &quot;no contest&quot; and resigned his license to practice. The lecture hall was renamed the Queen Street Auditorium.

Reforms were made after a series of deaths at the Queen Street Mental Health Centre and newspaper accounts of involuntary drug treatment, electroshock therapy, and prison-like conditions.

===Clarke Institute of Psychiatry===

The institute was founded in 1966 and officially opened by Ontario Premier John P. Robarts. It was named the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, after Charles Kirk Clarke, a pioneer in mental health in Canada. The institute took over the clinical, teaching, and research functions of the Toronto Psychiatric Hospital, located at 2 Surrey Place, which opened in 1925 under Clarence B. Farrar. The Institute served as the main psychiatry teaching hospital for the University of Toronto and was the headquarters for the Department of Psychiatry in the Faculty of Medicine. The first Medical and Executive Director of the Clarke was Charles Roberts, and the first Psychiatrist-in-Chief (and Professor and Head of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto) was Aldwyn B. Stokes. When Stokes retired in 1967, the administration was reorganized, and Robin Hunter became Medical Director and Psychiatrist-in-Chief.

Fredrick H. Lowy served as Psychiatrist-in-Chief of the Clarke from 1974 until 1980, followed by Vivian Rakoff from 1980 to 1990, and Paul E. Garfinkel from 1990 until the Clarke&#x27;s 1998 merger into CAMH.

Upon its merger into CAMH in 1998, the Clarke building become known as the CAMH College Street site. Conrad Black has been a generous supporter of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry.

==== Rent increase====
In 2015, CAMH&#x27;s facilities at the College St. site were put in jeopardy following notice of a rent increase from $1.2 million to $4 million per year, at the renewal of its 20-year lease. CAMH valued its property at $25 million, whereas the hospital&#x27;s landlord, Brookfield Asset Management, valued it at $100 million. Brookfield turned down CBC&#x27;s interview requests. A government arbitrator was appointed who valued the property at $55 million, yielding a rent increase that CAMH was reportedly able to pay.

===Addiction Research Foundation===
The Addiction Research Foundation (ARF), then named the Alcoholism Research Foundation was founded in 1949, when H. David Archibald, who had studied at the School of Alcohol Studies at Yale University, was hired by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. His mandate was to determine the scope of alcoholism in Ontario. He was named executive director when ARF opened and remained in that post until 1976. Focusing initially on outpatient treatment, their first facility was Brookside Hospital in 1951, expanding to branch offices and new locations in 1954, the same year they set up in-house research. In 1961, formally renamed the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario, ARF expanded its mission to include drugs. In 1971, they expanded to a clinical teaching hospital called the Clinical Research and Treatment Institute. In 1978 ARF opened the School for Addiction Studies and expanded their international role in policy development and research. Following provincial hospital restructuring in the 1990s, ARF was folded in 1998 into CAMH.

===Donwood Institute===
In 1946, R. Gordon Bell opened a clinic in his own home for people needing mental health services. There existed an Ontario statute allowing doctors to take up to four patients into their homes without a hospital license. To his surprise, his only patients all suffered from alcoholism. It soon became necessary to move to larger facilities. To expand capacity, Bell opened Shadow Brook, which operated from 1947 to 1954, and then the Bell Clinic, which operated from 1954 to 1966. The Donwood Institute then opened in 1967, with 47 beds and a 4-month waiting list in the 1980s. Still focused on substance use, it claimed a 65% recovery rate for general population and an 85% recovery rate among physicians with addictions.

===CAMH Queen St. Site Redevelopment ===

CAMH has been undergoing a three phase redevelopment centered at its Queen Street site, with four goals:
1) Deliver a new model of care and provide a healthy environment that promotes recovery;
2) Bring together the best research, clinical, education, health promotion, and policy experts in one place to change the future of mental health and addictions;
3) Revitalize the City of Toronto by opening up their site and by creating an inclusive new nine-block neighbourhood that benefits all and,
4) Change attitudes by breaking down barriers to eliminate the stigma of mental health. Phase 1A was undertaken by Eastern Construction and completed in 2008 and Phase 1B was undertaken by Carillion and completed in 2012. Phase 1C is being undertaken by PCL Construction and is expected to be complete in 2020.

In 2008, CAMH announced the completion of four new buildings (forming Phase 1A of the project) to accommodate CAMH&#x27;s Addiction and Mood &amp; Anxiety Programs.

The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute was established with a $30 million donation in 2011 from Linda Campbell, Gaye Farncombe, and Susan Grange, each granddaughters of Canadian magnate Roy Thomson and nieces of Ken Thomson. CAMH CEO, Catherine Zahn, said research on the brain is the most promising pathway to progress in mental illness research. Bell donated $10 million to CAMH in 2011, reportedly the largest corporate gift in Canada to mental illness.

In 2012, CAMH announced the completion of three new buildings (forming Phase 1B of the project): the Bell Gateway Building for the central administration, a utilities and parking building, and the Intergenerational Wellness Centre which includes 12 new beds for youth ages 14–18.

Margaret McCain, the former lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick and widow of McCain Foods co-founder Wallace McCain, donated $10 million to CAMH in 2012 to establish the Margaret and Wallace McCain Centre for Child, Youth and Family Mental Health. In 2013, the Slaight Family donated to $50 million to health care institutions, of which CAMH received $10 million. The donation permitted the opening of a centre dedicated to identifying and treating early signs of mental illness in youth.

In 2014, philanthropist and business executive Andrew Fass donated $1,000,000 to CAMH for the hospital to create a wellness program for its staff. In 2016, Fass withdrew his donation, saying that CAMH was unable to show how they were spending the money. The grant was to be used for CAMH&#x27;s &quot;Well@Work&quot; program, an initiative to provide Canadian workplaces with training to identify risks of mental illness and strategies to support employees in need.

CAMH opened the Emergency Department in 2014, funded by a $2.5 million private donation and a $4.2 million grant from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.

In 2016, CAMH constructed a sweat lodge for Aboriginal patients in order to promote spiritual, physical, and emotional healing. Also in 2016, CAMH opened walk-in clinics for youth.

In 2020, the eight-storey, 110 patient bed McCain Complex Care &amp; Recovery Building and five-storey 125 patient bed Crisis &amp; Critical Care Building and 24-hour psychiatric emergency department were opened.

==Research==
CAMH reports being the largest research facility in Canada for mental health and addictions, including over 100 scientists over 150 research trainees. In the 2014-2015 fiscal year, CAMH received $44,384,230 in research funding and published more than 500 research articles.

==Administration==
Psychiatrist and Clarke Institute President Paul E. Garfinkel was appointed the first President and CEO of CAMH in 1998. He was followed by neurologist Catherine Zahn in 2009.

Upon CAMH&#x27;s formation, Peter Catford was appointed vice president for Information Technology. In 2002, Catford outsourced the public hospital&#x27;s computer needs to H.I. Next, a private company which Catford founded and co-owned. When the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported on what it deemed an apparent conflict of interest regarding the spending of public money, the hospital would not reveal how much it paid Catford or his company, nor would CAMH disclose any details of its contract with H.I. Next or what other firms bid on the work. Catford commented only that &quot;I feel honoured to work with (CAMH) and I feel like it has been done ethically.&quot; In interviews with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Dev Chopra, executive vice-president of CAMH first said there was nothing inappropriate about Catford&#x27;s role. &quot;We got into it with our eyes open. There is no conflict.&quot; However, Chopra later said there were &quot;some optics from a conflict perspective&quot; noting the hospital might revisit the issue that day. Catford left his CAMH position two days later, but the Star reported that hospital officials said changes were being considered months before the Star published its story about the issue.

== Criticisms ==
CAMH&#x27;s administration has come under criticism including from staff who report safety problems and from donors who withdrew their funding citing accountability problems.

===David Healy Affair===
Soon after CAMH was founded, its administration was embroiled in a scandal involving Eli Lilly and Company, which donated $1.5 million to CAMH, and David Healy, a prominent critic of Prozac, the widely used antidepressant manufactured by Eli Lilly. CAMH hired Healy to be the head of its Mood and Anxiety Program, but withdrew the job offer after hearing about Healy&#x27;s views.

CAMH aggressively recruited Healy, and CAMH Physician-in-Chief, David Goldbloom, offered Healy a job as the head of the Mood and Anxiety Program. Healy accepted and soon after gave a lecture in which he reiterated his views about Prozac increasing risk of suicide. A few days later, Goldbloom withdrew the job offer, saying &quot;Essentially, we believe that it is not a good fit between you and the role as leader of an academic program in mood and anxiety disorders at the centre and in relation to the university….We do not feel your approach is compatible with the goals for development of the academic and clinical resource that we have.&quot;

The decision caused an &quot;uproar&quot; among Canadian academics, with the Canadian Association of University Teachers calling CAMH actions &quot;an affront to academic freedom in Canada.&quot; Scientists from 13 countries, including Nobel laureates Julius Axelrod and Arvid Carlsson, protested CAMH&#x27;s actions as did the Society for Academic Freedom and Scholarship (SAFS).

Healy sued CAMH and the University of Toronto, alleging breach of contract, defamation, and denial of academic freedom. The lawsuit sought damages of $9.4 million, including $2.6 million from CAMH CEO Paul Garfinkel, and $1.4 million from the U of T Dean of Medicine. The university distanced itself from CAMH: According to U of T President, Robert Birgeneau, &quot;Everyone is trying to blame the university for something that happened at one of our hospitals.&quot;

The lawsuit was settled with Healy receiving an appointment as visiting professor as the University of Toronto. The president of the Canadian Association of University Teachers, Vic Catano, said &quot;We see the settlement as a complete vindication for Dr. Healy.&quot;

===Child Gender Identity Clinic===
In 1975, psychiatrist Susan Bradley founded a clinic in CAMH to work with gender dysphoric children. Bradley collaborated for many years with psychologist Kenneth Zucker, and they established the clinic as the largest gender identity service in Canada and an international center for research. They said that in their studies, 80% of the children grow out of the behavior. They used different approaches with children than adolescents because they said that children were more likely to identify with their birth sex.

Regarding adolescents, Zucker would &quot;support a teenager or adult who wants to transition using hormones and surgeries.&quot; Regarding children, however, Zucker said, &quot;We are trying to help a child feel more comfortable with the gender identity that matches their birth sex,&quot; and that they use a variety of techniques to &quot;help a child think more flexibly&quot; about their gender. According to a 2006 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Zucker did this by &quot;encouraging same-sex friendships and activities like board games that move beyond strict gender roles.&quot; Zucker said that a child could be asked to make a list of pros and cons about being different genders so that the child realizes that &quot;there are both good and not so good things about being a boy and being a girl.&quot;

Zucker&#x27;s approach was controversial and considered by some to be conversion therapy. In January 2015, members of Rainbow Health Ontario, a provincial health promotion and navigation organization, approached CAMH expressing their concerns regarding Zucker&#x27;s clinic. Rainbow Health Ontario submitted a review of academic literature and clinical practices for transgender youth, and expressed concern that the gender identity clinic was not following accepted practices. Others online linked the Gender Identity Clinic&#x27;s practices to suicide of transgender youth caused by conversion therapy, and referenced the high-profile case of Leelah Alcorn, a transgender teen from Ohio. In February 2015, CAMH ordered an external review of its gender identity clinic for children and teens.

In March 2015, the Ontario Provincial Parliament introduced the Affirming Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Act, aimed at banning conversion therapy practices. In June 2015, the legislation was passed unanimously by the provincial parliament. The law made LGBT conversion therapy illegal to provide to minors, and removed it from public health insurance coverage for adults. After the bill was passed into law, CAMH stated that they welcomed the unanimous support for the bill.

The external review noted numerous strengths of the clinic, but also described it as an insular entity with an approach dissimilar from other clinics and described it as being out of step with current best practices, including WPATH SOC Version 7. They also raised concerns about clinicians asking age inappropriate questions. After the review, CAMH shut down the clinic and fired Zucker. Kwame McKenzie, medical director of CAMH&#x27;s child, youth, and family services, said &quot;We want to apologize for the fact that not all of the practices in our childhood gender identity clinic are in step with the latest thinking.&quot; CAMH announced a process of consultation with community leaders to examine how best to offer care.

In 2018, CAMH paid Zucker $586,000 and issued a public apology as part of a settlement.

===Forensics===
CAMH&#x27;s forensic department and its leadership have been the subject of criticism from Ontario judges and the public for issues including public safety, patient civil rights violations, and turning away patients ordered to CAMH by judges. This culminated in Ontario Superior Court Justice Maureen Forestell who reportedly &quot;tore a strip off of&quot; CAMH for its actions. Graham Glancy, a forensic psychiatrist at the Maplehurst Correctional Complex accused CAMH of focusing too much on patients and treatments to enhance its international reputation, but at the expense of the less glamorous forensic patients. He added &quot;Cities like Ottawa and London are better resourced but Toronto is terrible. It&#x27;s a disgrace, really.&quot; Toronto defence counsel Chris Hynes also attributed the problems to the CAMH leadership, saying &quot;CAMH front-line workers pay the price for decisions made by the centre&#x27;s privatized board of directors.&quot;

====AWOL patients====
One recurrent issue has been the number of violent or dangerous patients who escape custody from CAMH&#x27;s forensic wards. After filing a freedom of information act request with the police, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that CAMH had nearly as many AWOLs as all other Toronto hospitals combined (2,060 and 2,371 for the period 2004 to 2014).

One of the most widely reported incidents involved Thomas Brailsford, who was institutionalized at CAMH after beheading his mother and being deemed a &quot;danger to himself and others.&quot; Brailsford took off from a taxicab on his way to a medical appointment, representing his second escape in a year.

In an interview with Toronto columnist Jerry Agar, CAMH&#x27;s chief of forensic psychiatry, Sandy Simpson said &quot;Clearly, we will be reviewing this carefully to look at how we assessed the risk in this case.&quot; Kate Richards of CAMH media relations subsequently said &quot;We have tightened aspects of these procedures and...We are confident that the changes implemented in this case have been effective.&quot; Agar wrote that he has &quot;been eager to have Simpson back on the radio show to discuss what measures have been put in place&quot; but had not received any response. Five months later, CAMH told Agar &quot;Dr. Simpson is not available for a follow-up interview.&quot;

In 2019, the Ontario government ordered a review of CAMH patient passes and privileges after a series of patient escapes from the secure forensic psychiatry units. In one case, a not criminally responsible (NCR) patient who absconded the hospital later left the country by plane.

=== Workplace safety ===
In 2007, following a series of attacks on staff by patients, the Ontario Ministry of Labour asked CAMH to develop a workplace violence and policy program. In 2008, the Ministry of Labour laid nine workplace safety charges against CAMH in response to allegations by staff that they had been attacked by patients. CAMH was fined $70,000 in 2009 for two attacks against nursing staff by patients in 2007 and 2008. In 2014, the Ontario Ministry of Labour laid charges against CAMH for failing to protect workers from workplace violence by patients following an attack earlier that year.

In 2014, the Ontario Ministry of Labour laid more charges against CAMH for failing to implement procedures to protect staff from workplace violence following another attack by a patient that year. The prosecution asked the court to send “a clear message” that the CAMH situation was unacceptable. CAMH was found guilty and fined again. CAMH&#x27;s Chief of Nursing, Rani Srivastava, said that CAMH accepted the court&#x27;s decision adding that the violence had a “devastating impact” on “all of us at CAMH.”

Three months later, another nurse was punched, kicked in the face and dragged by a patient into a locked utility room where she was repeatedly kicked in the head by the patient, suffering fractures and nerve damage. Vicki McKenna of the Ontario Nurses&#x27; Association reported that CAMH has not been taking part in government committees to improve workplace safety and called for CAMH senior management to be held personally responsible for the continued workplace violence. Rani Srivastava said that the incident was &quot;completely unexpected,&quot; that CAMH is &quot;saddened&quot; and &quot;shocked&quot; by what happened, and that &quot;any incident is one too many.&quot;

===Reporting failures===
Simpson has also been criticized by the Ontario Review Board for secluding a patient for two months but not informing the board, as required. Simpson claimed that the regulation &quot;was unclear&quot; about whether CAMH had a duty to report what it was doing. The board disagreed, ruling against CAMH.

==Public policy statements==
CAMH issues statements about local and provincial regulations on addictive behaviors. CAMH policy opposes the privatization of alcohol sales, citing evidence that the increase in availability increases alcohol-related harms and associated costs. They supported that the Liquor Control Board of Ontario should maintain its monopoly on alcohol sales. CAMH referred to &quot;the plan to allow the sale of VQA wines at farmers&#x27; markets across the province&quot; as &quot;cause for concern&quot; because it would increase access to alcohol. Similarly, together with other health organizations, CAMH called for a provincial alcohol strategy, ahead of Ontario&#x27;s plan to permit the sale of beer in grocery stores. In a 2014 policy document, CAMH expressed support for the legalization of marijuana with strict control regulations. According to CAMH CEO, Catherine Zahn, &quot;Only through legalization can we implement a public-health approach, treating cannabis use as a health issue and not one to be addressed through law enforcement and the court system. This is the approach we take with tobacco and alcohol. As with alcohol, a legal cannabis market can be regulated with controls that address risk factors associated with use&quot;. CAMH has opposed the expansion of Toronto&#x27;s Woodbine Racetrack. In a policy statement, CAMH said increased availability of gambling results in increased harms and predicted that a large portion of any increased revenues from the racetrack would come from people with gambling problems.

==Music videos==
A music video was released accompanying the single off the album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Jungle Out There&quot;. Although the exact meaning is disputed, it shows an attractive woman in a &quot;watering hole&quot; being flirted with by the band&#x27;s three lead vocalists and other bystanders. After the woman has had enough, she goes on dates with the singers and a bystander, then vanishes into thin air while on the date, tricking them into thinking she was actually in love with each, when in reality, it was only a plot to get rid of them. The video ends with a shot of her sitting alone in the &quot;watering hole&quot;, having tricked and scared off every man who was interested in her.

The video was released on the Stet recording label and received &quot;Light&quot; and &quot;Medium&quot; screenplay.

Another video was recorded for &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot;, directed by David Minasian. Although never commercially released, it was filmed on the set of the television program Fantasy Island, and on the streets of Beverly Hills, California.

==Charts==
The album failed to sell to its full potential due to its label, Passport, going bankrupt. However, it sold a certified 60,000 copies, which rose over time to an estimated total of 200,000 to 300,000 copies.

<text>Owning Mahowny is a 2003 Canadian film starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, Minnie Driver, Maury Chaykin and John Hurt. The film is based on the true story of Brian Molony, a Toronto bank employee who embezzled more than $10 million to feed his gambling addiction. &quot;Owning Mahowny&quot; was named one of the ten best films of the year by critic Roger Ebert.

==Plot==
Between 1980 and 1982, Toronto bank employee Dan Mahowny is given access to bigger accounts with his promotion to assistant branch manager. His boss trusts him, but is unaware that Mahowny is a compulsive gambler. Mahowny is soon skimming larger and larger amounts for his own use and making weekly trips to Atlantic City, where he is treated like a king by the casino manager. Mahowny&#x27;s girlfriend, fellow bank employee Belinda, cannot understand what is happening. Mahowny&#x27;s criminal acts come to light when Toronto police begin to investigate his longtime bookie Frank.

==Cast==
==Real-life inspiration==
&quot;Owning Mahowny&quot; is based on the life of a real person. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce clerk Brian Molony embezzled over $10 million from his employers in just 18 months to support his gambling habit. Molony&#x27;s story was told in the best-selling 1987 book &quot;Stung&quot; by journalist Gary Ross, which formed the basis for the screenplay.

Molony was a manager at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, with access to significant resources. Upon the discovery of his gambling addiction and his crime, he was prosecuted in Canada by Crown Attorney Peter DeJulio. Molony was defended by Edward Greenspan. He received a sentence of six years imprisonment, as sought by the Crown. In an interview on the website of &quot;Stung&quot; publishers McClelland and Stewart, Ross says he has kept in touch with Molony and updated what happened to him after the events portrayed in the movie. Molony served only two years of his sentence. He has not gambled since his arrest, has married his girlfriend, has three sons and works as a financial consultant.

The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce took court action to recover funds from casinos in Atlantic City that enabled Molony&#x27;s gambling addiction. The case was settled for an undisclosed sum.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 79% based on reviews from 96 critics, with an average rating of 6.99/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 70% based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert named &quot;Owning Mahowny&quot; one of the top ten films of 2003, and assessed Hoffman&#x27;s performance as &quot;a masterpiece of discipline and precision&quot;, calling him a &quot;fearless poet of implosion, [who] plays the role with a fierce integrity, never sending out signals for our sympathy because he knows that Mahowny is oblivious to our presence.&quot; However, some critics believed that in his self-effacing performance, Hoffman refused to conform to expectations of a typical movie character and that the movie suffered as a result. Stephanie Zacharek considered him to be a &quot;character who squirms right out of our grasp&quot;, and despite being the movie&#x27;s anchor, he&#x27;s &quot;such a vaporous one, he leaves &quot;us&quot; feeling adrift&quot;.

Asked whether Philip Seymour Hoffman&#x27;s portrayal matched the real Brian Molony, journalist Gary Ross replied, &quot;Remarkably so. They have the same stocky build, bushy moustache, glasses, slightly unkempt look, and earnestness. And Philip somehow managed to assimilate the psychic essence of Molony — a yawning emptiness that nothing except gambling was able to fill.&quot;

&quot;Owning Mahowny&quot; earned $1 million, significantly less than its $10 million budget.

===Awards===
&quot;Owning Mahowny&quot; received nominations for Best Motion Picture, Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, Best Screenplay (Adapted) and Best Achievement in Music — Original Score (Richard Grassby-Lewis, Jon Hassell) at the 24th Genie Awards.

<doc id="1244828" wikidata="Q294695" url="?curid=1244828" title="AMC Hornet">
<text>The AMC Hornet is a compact automobile manufactured and marketed by American Motors Corporation (AMC) from 1970 through 1977—in two- and four-door sedan, station wagon, and hatchback coupe configurations. The Hornet replaced the compact Rambler American line, marking the end of the Rambler marque in the American and Canadian markets.

The Hornet became significant for AMC in not only being a top seller during its production, but also a car platform serving the company in varying forms through the 1988 model year. Introduced late-1969, AMC quickly earned a high rate return for its development investment for the Hornet. The platform became the basis for AMC&#x27;s subcompact Gremlin, luxury compact Concord, liftback and sedan Spirit, and the innovative all-wheel drive AMC Eagle. Its design would also outlast the compact platforms the domestic competitors used, including the Chevrolet Nova, Ford Maverick, and Plymouth Valiant.

The AMC Hornet also served as an experimental platform for alternative fuel and other automotive technologies. Hornets were campaigned in various motorsports events with some corporate support. A hatchback model also starred in an exceptional stunt jump in the 1974 James Bond film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;.

Hornets were marketed in foreign markets and were assembled under license agreements between AMC and local manufacturers—for example, with Vehículos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM), Australian Motor Industries (AMI), and Toyota S.A. Ltd. in South Africa.

== The &quot;Hornet&quot; name ==
Hudson introduced the first Hornet in 1951 as a performance model featuring the Hudson&#x27;s new &quot;H-145&quot; engine. The automaker formed a stock car racing team centered on the car, and the &quot;Fabulous Hudson Hornet&quot; soon became famous for its wins and stock-car title sweeps between 1951 and 1954. Hornets &quot;dominated stock car racing in the early-1950s, when stock car racers actually drove regular production stock cars.&quot; The Hudson Hornet car inspired Paul Newman&#x27;s Doc Hudson movie character.

American Motors retained rights to the &quot;Hornet&quot; name during the Automobile Manufacturers Association (AMA) resolution on factory-supported racing from 1957 until 1962. This was initiated by the AMA to limit the auto industry&#x27;s horsepower race and corporate sponsorship of racing to glamorize speed and performance. Thus, the Hornet was dormant from 1958 until 1969 when AMC introduced a new compact car line for the 1970 model year.

The Hornet name has since become steeped in history, not only for being a motorsport legend that was later immortalized in movies, but also because it was a &quot;game changer&quot; for AMC as the compact-size Hornet platform became the base for new market segments.

The rights to the &quot;Hornet&quot; nameplate were then passed to Chrysler with that company&#x27;s acquisition of AMC in 1987. The nameplate has been through several unrealized uses by Chrysler since then. The Hornet nameplate was reintroduced for the 2023 model year as a compact SUV marketed under the Dodge brand.

== AMC Hornet development ==

A pair of 1966 show cars, the AMC Cavalier four-door sedan and the Vixen coupe, foreshadowed the Hornet&#x27;s styling. These designs showed that &quot;AMC&#x27;s stylists had a very good grasp of the direction the industry as a whole would take as 1970 began.&quot; Introduced in 1969 for the 1970 model year, AMC&#x27;s replacement for the Rambler American became &quot;a car that could hardly have hit the market more squarely.&quot; The objective of AMC was to target buyers who wanted economy in a car with style, performance, and &quot;fun to drive.&quot; The Hornet, as well as the Ford Maverick, was considered a response by the domestic automakers to battle with the imports.

Development of the new model took AMC three years, a million person-hours, and US$40 million. The Hornet was an all-new design. An all-new front suspension with anti-brake dive was developed for AMC&#x27;s large-sized &quot;senior&quot; 1970 models, and instead of developing lighter components for the new compact-size platform, the same parts were incorporated into the Hornet.

The chassis and sheet metal were entirely new, with the conventional front-engine rear-drive drivetrain carried over from the previous Rambler American. The Hornet&#x27;s wheelbase platform (two inches or 5.08 centimeters longer than its predecessor. The design incorporated AMC&#x27;s numerous innovative features and groundbreaking ideas. The AMC Hornet was the first U.S.-made automobile to feature guardrail beam doors to protect occupants in the event of a side impact.

The compact-sized Hornet continued AMC&#x27;s role as a &quot;niche&quot; marketer specializing in small cars. It became one of AMC&#x27;s best sellers. The Hornet was the first car in a line of new models that AMC would introduce over the following three years. It set the tone for what designer Dick Teague and chief executive officer Roy D. Chapin Jr. had in mind for the company for the 1970s. The platform evolved into the four-wheel-drive Eagle that was produced through 1988.

With its manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price (MSRP) of $1,994 for the base two-door model, the Hornet was a low-priced, economical small family car providing &quot;cut-above interior appointments. The basic 1970 Ford Maverick was listed at $1 more while the Chevrolet Nova and Plymouth Duster were priced 10% higher. The Hornet and the Maverick were designed to stem the tide of imported cars that had captured 10% of the total U.S. market, with 80% of them retailing under $2,000. The domestic cars got bigger, heavier, consumed more gasoline, had more options, and generated more profits for the manufactures, but sales of economical foreign cars increased. Of the original eleven compact car nameplates, only four still qualified as compact-sized by 1969, and only one, the Rambler American, was priced under $2,000.

The Hornet was initially available in a choice of two economical straight-six engines or a V8. When equipped with the V8 engine, the Hornet was in the compact performance market segment (along with the Ford Maverick, Chevrolet Nova, and Mopars for buyers who &quot;wanted to drive something fun&quot; without increasingly expensive to operate muscle cars.

The Hornet was offered as a two-door and four-door notchback sedan in its introductory year. The station wagon and hardtop (no &quot;B&quot; pillar) coupe body styles were not continued from the predecessor Rambler American line.

In April 1970, a mid-model year introduction used the Hornet as the basis for the wheelbase AMC Gremlin, which utilized the front half of the two-door Hornet&#x27;s body and a truncated rear section with a window hatchback.

A four-door station wagon variant named the &quot;Sportabout&quot; was added to the 1971 lineup. It featured a steeply raked hatchback rather than a conventional station wagon design with a rear window retracting into a drop-down tailgate. American Motors was careful not to describe the new body style as a traditional station wagon. Advertising emphasized that &quot;it&#x27;s not so much a station wagon as it is a sporty car with cargo space&quot; and that the Sportabout is in a class by itself because it &quot;combines fun with function.&quot;

A unique SC/360 model was added for the 1971 model year. Available only as a two-door sedan, it included AMC&#x27;s V8 engine as standard, making it a compact-sized muscle car. For the 1973 model year, a semi-fastback hatchback coupe with fold-down rear seats was also added to the lineup.

In 1973, a Levi&#x27;s Jeans trim package was added based on the famous jeans manufacturer. The Levi&#x27;s trim package was popular and was available for several years. The Hornet station wagon version was offered for two model years with a luxury trim package designed by Italian fashion designer Dr. Aldo Gucci. It is notable for being one of the first American cars to offer an upscale fashion &quot;designer&quot; trim level.

The Hornet was phased out after the 1977 model year. The platform transformed into a new &quot;luxury compact&quot; line of automobiles, the AMC Concord. The Hornet&#x27;s rear-wheel drive platform also served as the basis of the innovative &quot;crossover&quot; all-wheel drive line of models, the AMC Eagle that was introduced in 1979.

== Year-by-year changes ==

=== 1970 ===

Introduced in September 1969, the first-year Hornets came in &quot;base&quot; and higher trim SST models, in two- and four-door sedan body styles. American Motors positioned the new line of sedans to be an American-designed small car that did not automatically stand for &quot;cheap&quot; by including features and conveniences that were optional to not available on competing brands, as well as making the Hornet wider on a longer wheelbase and with more body weight giving extra stability, increased ride comfort, better handling, interior room, trunk space, and enhanced security.

The Hornet was promoted as &quot;the little rich car&quot; with room for five passengers. The base model two-door sedan was $1,994, with the four-door an additional $78. The base Hornets &quot;were nicely trimmed for the price&quot; with standard armrests, ashtrays, interior lights, glove box, cigarette lighter, coat hooks, and an integrated dash ventilation system. The SST trim models were priced at $150 additional to the base two- or four-door versions and added a bright trim for the roof, wheel fender openings, rocker panel, and insert between the taillights, as well as a custom steering wheel, locking glove box, full-width under-dash parcel shelf, day/night rearview mirror, and functional items. The SST was available with two-tone paint, a black, white, or blue vinyl covered roof, as well as individually adjustable reclining front seats in upholstered in custom fabric with matching side trim and door panels.

The straight-6 engine with a one-barrel carburetor rated at at 4400 rpm and of torque at 1600 rpm was standard on base trim models. The SST versions included the one-barrel engine producing at 4300 rpm and of torque at 1600 rpm. A two-barrel version of this engine was optional on both models increasing output by and . The standard transmission was the column-shifted three-speed manual with the one-barrel I-6 engines. Optional was the three-speed automatic and required with the two-barrel .

The SST models were available with a two-barrel V8 engine rated at at 4400 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm. The V8 option was only offered together with the automatic transmission and included a standard front suspension sway bar, larger 11-inch drum brakes, and optional power-assisted front disk brakes as well as up-sized fiberglass-belted tires that included C or D78x14 black or twin-stripe whitewalls and D70x14 red lines.

The annual new car issue of &quot;Popular Science&quot; introduced the 1970 model by entitling its article: &quot;Rambler is dead – long live the Hornet!&quot; The authors not only compared the new Hornet with the outgoing Rambler American, but also with its primary competition, the Ford Maverick and finding the Hornet better to Ford&#x27;s new model in several factors that are significant to consumers, as well as &quot;certainly superior among economy cars&quot; in ride-and-handling and &quot;way ahead&quot; in performance.

&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; magazine road-tested an SST trim version with the V8 engine and automatic transmission and summarized the findings in the article&#x27;s sub-title: &quot;It has a lot of good things in a not-too-small package.&quot;

&quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine conducted a comparison road test of four of the lowest-priced U.S. cars (AMC Hornet, Ford Maverick, Plymouth Duster, and Chevrolet Nova), describing the 1970 Hornet as offering more interior and trunk room, excellent visibility in all directions, achieving the highest fuel economy, needed the optional disk brakes, and the authors concluded that it was the &quot;practical family car ... better value than any of the others&quot;.

: 1970 production:
:: 2-door base: 43,610
:: 4-door base: 17,948
:: 2-door SST: 19,748
:: 4-door SST: 19,786

=== 1971 ===
The 1971 model year was the introduction of the Sportabout, a 4-door wagon using a steeply sloped back design with a single liftgate-type hatch. The styling was well-executed to appear muscular and purposeful while the liftgate-type station wagon appeared revolutionary in an era of traditional and upright rear tailgates. All featured a &quot;Sportabout&quot; emblem at the rear of the bodysides.

The two- and four-door sedans were carryovers. The I6 engine was now standard across the range.

A marketing promotion in the Spring made available a new fabric folding sunroof on specially equipped Hornets, as well as on the Gremlin. The opening roof feature was included with the purchase of whitewall tires, custom wheel covers, pinstripes or rally stripes, a light group, and a special visibility group.

==== SC/360 ====

The SC/360 was added for the 1971 model year as a compact 2-door muscle car that was intended as a follow-up to the 1969 SC Rambler. The tire pressure sticker on the initial production of 1970 models hinted at the availability of the 360 V8 engine. The standard engine for the SC/360 was AMC&#x27;s V8. The SC/360 was distinguished by styled wheels, body striping, individual fully reclining front seats as well as other performance and appearance upgrades. In standard form, with a two-barrel carburetor, the 360 produced (gross) and the car was priced at just US$2,663 (about $40 below the 1971 Plymouth Duster 340). This combination was offered by AMC to achieve a 12.5:1 weight-to-horsepower ratio for insurance rate calculations.

With the addition of the $199 &quot;Go&quot; package&#x27;s four-barrel carburetor and ram-air induction, the SC&#x27;s power increased to . Optional in place of the standard three-speed was a Hurst-shifted GM Borg-Warner Super T10 four-speed or an automatic transmission. Goodyear Polyglas D70x14 blackwall tires were standard, with upgrades including white lettered tires, a heavy-duty suspension package, and the Spicer &quot;Twin-Grip&quot; limited slip differential with 3.54:1 or 3.90:1 gears.

Although the SC/360 could not compete with the holdover big-engined muscle cars, the SC combined respectable quickness (0 to 60 mph in 6.7 seconds) and the quarter mile (1320 feet, 402 m) dragstrip in 14.9 at with a taut suspension, big tires, and modest size; thus &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine described it as &quot;just a plain gas to drive ... it handles like a dream.&quot; &quot;Hot Rod&quot; magazine ran the 1/4 mile an SC/360 with automatic transmission weighing in 14.80 seconds at 94.63 mph in &quot;bone-stock form&quot; and predicted that high 13s could be achieved &quot;with little more than a rejet and recurve of the carb and distributor.&quot; The authors also praised the car&#x27;s handling and braking by summarizing: &quot;Unbelievable. I think it&#x27;s some great little car!&quot; &quot;Car Craft&quot; magazine testers bolted on better tires, headers, and traction bars to run the 1/4 mile in 13.78 seconds at .

The muscle car market segment reached the height of popularity in 1970, but the combination of rising fuel and insurance prices along with emerging emissions reductions meant the end of an era. American Motors originally planned to build as many as 10,000 of the cars, but high insurance premiums killed the SC/360 after a single year&#x27;s production of just 784 examples. A total of 304 were built with the now-preferred combination of a four-speed manual transmission and a four-barrel carburetor.

The Sportabout version was the most popular model by far, outselling all other Hornet models combined in its debut year. For most of its production, it was the only American-made station wagon in its size class.

=== 1972 ===


American Motors established a new focus on quality with the 1972 model year. The &quot;Buyer Protection Plan&quot;, was the industry&#x27;s innovative 12-month or comprehensive, bumper-to-bumper warranty. This was an industry-first that included providing a loaner car as well as trip-interruption protection, all at a time when most automakers offered only a limited six-month warranty on their new cars. During that time, &quot;long-term accountability was something that automakers on any continent attempted to avoid.&quot;

The 1972 AMC Buyer Protection Plan was possible due to numerous mechanical upgrades to increase durability, as well as a focus on quality in sourcing and production. Production quality was increased as well as pre-delivery preparation by the dealer that includes &quot;230 inspections and the road test each car ... to find any problems before the car is delivered, so the customer will not have to come back later.&quot;

American Motors promoted the 1972 Hornet as &quot;a Tough Little Car&quot;. The automaker promised to repair anything wrong with the car (except for the tires), and owners were provided with a toll-free telephone number to the company as well as a free loaner car if a warranty repair took overnight.

To consolidate AMC&#x27;s product offering, reduce production costs, and offer more value to consumers, the base models were dropped and all 1972 Hornets were designated as &quot;SST&quot; trim. The single SST version of the 2-door and 4-door sedans, as well as the Sportabout station wagon, offered more items standard than the previous year&#x27;s base model at about the same price. Electric windshield wipers and washers replaced the standard vacuum-operated units. With no stripped-down basic models, all Hornets now came with comfort and convenience items that most consumers expected. For the first time, an AM/FM monaural radio was added to the options list.

Other changes included dropping the SC/360 compact muscle car, but the two-barrel version of the remained optional in addition to the V8 engine. For those desiring more performance, a four-barrel carburetor was a dealer-installed option on the 360 V8. Automatic transmissions were now the TorqueFlites sourced from Chrysler, and AMC called it the &quot;Torque-Command&quot;.

New for the 1972 model year was the &quot;X&quot; package that attempted to replicate the success AMC had had with this trim option on the 1971 Gremlin. The Hornet X trim package was available on the two-door sedan and the new Sportabout. It could be ordered with any of the available I6 and V8 engines and included rally stripes, &quot;X&quot; emblems, a three-spoke sports steering wheel, and 14 x 6-inch slot-style steel road wheels with C78 x 14 Polyglas blackwall tires. A performance-oriented &quot;Rallye&quot; package was also introduced. It included among other items: special lower body stripes, a full-synchromesh three-speed manual gearbox with floor shift, bucket seats, handling package, front disc brakes, 20.1 quick-ratio manual steering box, and a sports steering wheel. It was possible to order both the Rallye and the X-package.

&quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine tested a V8 Hornet in 1972, measuring performance from 0 to 60 mph in 9 seconds flat and the 1/4-mile dragstrip in 16.8 seconds at . These were virtually equal to the V8 Chevrolet Nova that was tested in the same issue.

:: 2-door SST: 27,122
:: 4-door SST: 24,254
:: Wagon SST: 34,065 (Gucci version: 2,583)

==== Gucci Sportabout ====
The 1972 model year Hornet was one of the first American cars to offer a special luxury trim package created by a renowned fashion designer. The &quot;special interiors were stylish and unlike anything the industry had seen before, helping secure the company&#x27;s reputation as a design leader.&quot;

Developed in conjunction with Italian fashion designer Dr. Aldo Gucci, the Gucci package was offered only on the Sportabout, the four-door wagon with a single sloping hatch replacing the then-traditional window/tailgate door. The Gucci option included special beige-colored upholstery fabrics on thickly padded seats and inside door panels (with red and green striping) along with Gucci logo emblems and a choice of four exterior colors: Snow White; Hunter Green; Grasshopper Green, and Yuca Tan. The Gucci model proved to be a success, with 2,583 produced in 1972 (and 2,252 more for 1973) Sportabouts that were so equipped.

American Motors also produced a one-off Sportabout for Gucci&#x27;s personal use. The car included the V8 engine with three-speed automatic transmission. The interior featured leather on the door panels, cargo area as well as special front and rear center armrests. The doors and custom-designed bucket seats received red and green striped inserts. The instrument panel was given a centrally located, pull-out writing desk, graced with a scribbler and a sterling silver bamboo pen. A map light at the end of a flexible arm extended from the right side of the desk while the left side carried a vanity mirror that was also mounted on a flexible stem. The backs of the front seats included compartments as on airlines. The one on the right side opened as a snack table or provided a flat surface for playing games. The compartment behind the driver concealed a miniature liquor cabinet, complete with four sterling silver tumbles and two decanters—all decorated with red and green enamel stripes.

American Motors followed this designer influence in successive years with the Cardin Javelin in 1973 and the Cassini Matador in 1974, but there were no new signature designer versions after those. This trim package concept inspired other automakers – including Ford&#x27;s luxury marque, Lincoln in 1976 – to offer packages styled by other famous fashion designers.

==== Green Hornet ====
In 1972, AMC&#x27;s Canadian Brampton Assembly plant produced a two-door Hornet that was marketed only in Canada as the limited edition Green Hornet to &quot;cash in on the popular Green Hornet hero.&quot;

In addition to being painted green, the model included a &quot;Baja&quot; grain vinyl-covered roof and came standard with sport-styled wheel covers, and whitewall tires. The I6 engine was standard along with a three-speed Torque-Command automatic transmission. Options included bucket seats, body side stripes, and the I6 or V8 engine. Production was limited to 300 of this special model.

=== 1973 ===

The biggest visible changes among all AMC automobiles for the 1973 model year were to the Hornet line and its new model, a two-door hatchback. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine called it &quot;the styling coup of 1973&quot;. Other changes included a new front-end design and bodywork with a V-shaped grille, a slightly recessed and longer hood, and longer peaked front fenders. The facelift incorporated a new stronger and larger energy-absorbing recoverable front bumper system with a horizontal rubber strip that met the new no-damage at NHTSA safety legislation. The rear also received a new bumper with twin vertical rubber guards, but the 5 mph unit (matching the front) was optional. The overall length of the Hornet was increased by .

For the 1973 model year, the SST designation was dropped from the Hornet line, and all were simply called Hornet. The newly introduced two-door hatchback incorporated a fold-down rear seat for increased cargo volume from . An optional hinged floor made a hidden storage space that housed a temporary use &quot;space-saver&quot; spare tire and created a flat load area space totaling .

The new hatchback was available with Levi&#x27;s bucket seat interior trim option that was made of spun nylon fabric, rather than real cotton denim, to comply with flammability standards as well as offer greater wear and stain resistance. The interior included copper Levi&#x27;s rivets, traditional contrasting stitching, and a traditional Levi&#x27;s tab on both the front seat backs, as well as door panels with Levis trim with removable map pockets while the exterior included &quot;Levi&#x27;s&quot; decals on the front fenders.

An optional dealer accessory was available to convert the open hatchback area into a recreational vehicle or camper with mosquito net windows. The Mini-Camper Kit converted an open hatchback into a camping compartment and enough room for sleeping with the rear seat folded down. The &quot;Mini-Camper&quot; was a weatherproof covering that fitted over the roof section from the B-pillar back to the rear bumper that was easy to set up.

The two- and four-door sedan models were carried over while the Sportabout wagon received a new optional upscale &quot;D/L&quot; package. This trim package included exterior woodgrain bodyside decal panels, a roof rack with a rear air deflector, and individual reclining seats upholstered in plush cloth. The Gucci edition wagon was continued for one more year with five exterior color choices. The &quot;X&quot; package was now available only for the Sportabout and hatchback. It included color-coordinated &quot;rally&quot; side stripes, 14 x 6-inch slot-style steel wheels with C78 x 14 Goodyear Polyglas tires, an &quot;X&quot; emblem, and a sports steering wheel.

Engines incorporated new emissions controls and the choices on all Hornet models included two I6s, the standard or a version, as well as two V8s, the base or the . Any Hornet model could be ordered with the two-barrel 360 engine and automatic transmission. Demand for classic muscle car cars had disappeared by 1973, but the Hornet was a relatively light car and was a &quot;mildly spirited performer&quot; in stock form with the new emissions gear. A Hornet hatchback with the 360 V8 was tested by &quot;Car and Driver&quot;. The 0-60 time was 8.4 seconds with a 3.15 rear axle ratio and the magazine noted that the Hornet hatchback was &quot;...so good that AMC is sure to finally lose its underdog status.&quot;

A comparison road test by &quot;Popular Science&quot; selected the most &quot;trend-setting&quot; and &quot;deluxe compacts&quot; with V8 engines. The Hornet hatchback model was described as &quot;one of the most modern cars on the market&quot; and the and automatic transmission-equipped Hornet hatchback recorded 0-60 acceleration 12.1 seconds and fuel economy. Another &quot;Popular Science&quot; road test of compact four-door sedans compared the AMC Hornet , Ford Maverick , Chevrolet Nova , and Plymouth Valiant . The Hornet was described as having an interior &#x27;filled with features to make riding and driving more enjoyable&quot; as well as good braking, handling, and maneuverability. The test car&#x27;s V8 &quot;beat all the competition for best acceleration, and then beat them again in fuel economy.&quot;

Research sponsored by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to improve front and side crashworthiness was first applied to production compact vehicles starting with the 1973 Hornet, which included stronger doors designed to withstand penetration in the first of crush.

Spurred by AMC&#x27;s success in its strategy of improving product quality, and an advertising campaign focusing on &quot;we back them better because we build them better&quot;, the automaker achieved record profits. American Motors&#x27; comprehensive &quot;Buyer Protection Plan&quot; warranty was expanded for the 1973 models to cover lodging expenses should a car require overnight repairs when the owner is away from home.

Suggested prices began at $2,298 for the base model two-door sedan with the more popular new hatchback going for $2,449.

=== 1974 ===

All four versions of the Hornet were mostly carryovers in 1974, with minimal trim changes. The front bumper lost its full-width vinyl rub strip but gained two rubber-faced bumper guards. A larger energy-absorbing rear bumper was added to meet new front and rear safety standards requiring the license plate to be moved up to a position between the taillights. The design of these bumpers has been evaluated as not detracting from the Hornet&#x27;s styling compared to some used by the competition.

New inertial-reel seat/shoulder belts were standard. Additionally, the NHTSA required all new cars to include an inexpensive technology called a &quot;seat belt interlock mechanism&quot; for front-seat passengers to buckle up before the engine would start. However, Congress quickly passed a law killing the interlock mechanism and ordering that the warning sound indicating an unsecured front seat passenger could last no more than eight seconds.

A review by &quot;Popular Science&quot; of the 1974 cars and achieving fuel economy described the Hornet Sportabout as the only domestically built compact station wagon and they &quot;give it our highest recommendation.&quot;

Marketing of the 1974 Hornet included placement as a lead vehicle in a James Bond movie &quot;The Man With The Golden Gun&quot; which included a chase scene with a red hatchback jumping a broken bridge. All Hornet body styles saw sales gains compared to the previous year.

=== 1975 ===

Focusing on developing and introducing the entirely new Pacer model, AMC kept the Hornet mostly the same. A new grille with vertical grating was the primary change. A new &quot;Touring Package&quot; included special upholstery and luxury features. In a return to its philosophy of economical compact cars, AMC emphasized its comprehensive &quot;Buyer Protection Plan&quot; warranty in marketing the Hornets.

Six-cylinder Hornets could be ordered with a new British-supplied Laycock de Normanville &quot;J-type&quot; overdrive. Optional on cars with a manual three-speed transmission, the unit was controlled by a pushbutton at the end of the turn signal stalk. The overdrive unit engages automatically at speeds above and drops out at . It also included an accelerator pedal kick-down switch for faster passing.

All U.S. market Hornets featured catalytic converters and now required gasoline without tetraethyl lead. &quot;Unleaded Fuel Only&quot; warnings were displayed on both the fuel gauge and on a decal by the fuel filler. Consumers complained loudly about the 1974 &quot;mandatory seat belt&quot; system, and it was replaced in 1975 with a simple reminder buzzer and light.

The U.S. economy was experiencing a period of high inflation, with American Motors increasing the suggested sticker prices by an average of 13%, and new car sales fell for all automakers. The industry sold 8.2 million units, a drop of more than 2.5 million from the record pace in 1973. Sales of the Hornet also declined although marketing included cash rebates to buyers that ranged from $200 to $600 a car or a combination of cash and an extension of its Buyer Protection” warranty valued at $99.

=== 1976 ===

American Motors experienced success with the innovative Pacer and increased production of the unchanged 1976 model Pacers to 800 units a day. The problem with the sales of the Pacer was the negative impact on the sales of both the compact Hornet and subcompact Gremlin models.

In its sixth year as a carryover model, AMC priced the Hornet sedan and hatchback at the same as the year before with only the Sportabout slightly higher. The 1976 model year saw the introduction of the Dodge Aspen and Plymouth Volare twins that included a station wagon body style. These had a more upright top-hinged rear tailgate with a lower lift-over with greater cargo capacity than the Sportabout and they ended AMC&#x27;s monopoly on domestic compact-sized wagons.

: 1976 production:
:: Total: 71,577

=== 1977 ===
The Hornet line was mostly unchanged for 1977 with improvements made to engines and transmissions for increased fuel efficiency and the effects of new nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission standards. All three-speed manual transmissions shifters were now mounted on the floor. A new &quot;AMX&quot; model also appeared.

: 1977 production:
:: 2-door: 6,076
:: 4-door: 31,331
:: Wagon: 28,891
:: Hatchback: 11,545

In late 1977, the Hornet was re-engineered and restyled to become the 1978 Concord and helped establish the &quot;luxury compact&quot; market segment. With its upgraded design, components, and more standard features, the new Concord was moved upscale from the economy-focused Hornet. Changes to the AMC&#x27;s &quot;junior&quot; platform made the new Concord more comfortable and desirable to buyers seeking an image of luxury, as well as greater value.

==== AMX ====
A new sports-oriented model, the AMX, was introduced to appeal to young, performance-oriented car buyers. This model marked the return of a famous name that evoked AMC&#x27;s original AMX two-seat sports car. It was one of the revived muscle cars by the domestic automakers. The AMX was available only as a hatchback with the I6 featuring a floor-shifted four-speed manual or optional floor shifted automatic transmission. The only transmission with the V8 engine was the automatic. Standard was an upgraded black or tan interior with a floor console, &quot;rally&quot; instrumentation with tachometer, and a &quot;soft-feel&quot; sports steering wheel.

The Hornet AMX &quot;looked the part of a true performance car&quot; with its standard spoilers, airfoils, and body-colored rear window louvers. It was available in only four exterior colors. The Alpine White, Firecracker Red, Sunshine Yellow, or Lime Green colors included matching painted bumpers with a wraparound rubber guard strip, bodyside rubber guard strip, and contrasting AMX model identification bodyside decals ahead of the rear wheels. The exterior featured a front spoiler integrated into the front lower fender extensions, rear lower fender flares, sport-styled road wheels, brushed aluminum &quot;Targa top&quot; band over the B-pillars and roof, blacked-out grille, door and quarter frames, rear lower panel, and left and right outside mirrors. Options included bright aluminum road wheels as well as large Hornet-graphic decals on the hood and a smaller one on the decklid. In addition to the standard upholstery colors, the Levi&#x27;s interior was optional, but only 100 Hornet AMX models were so equipped. A regional &quot;California Edition&quot; was available with &quot;C.E.&quot; decals on the front fenders and an optional Audiovox stereo system.

&quot;Popular Science&quot; road tested the AMC Hornet AMX , Ford Mustang II Cobra II , Chevrolet Monza Spyder , and Plymouth Volare Road Runner noting that &quot;in looks and performance they remind of, but don&#x27;t match, yesterday&#x27;s tire-burning rockets&quot; and serve as &quot;image cars&quot; to what are &quot;otherwise a sedate group of high-production compacts&quot; for the fuel-efficiency focused consumers. The comparison noted its low-mounted bucket seats, superior rear seat room to that of the Mustang and Monza, and the rear window louvers that limit visibility to the rear. The Hornet AMX received high marks in entry/exit ease, maneuverability, and acceleration by achieving 0 to 60 mph in 12.0 seconds. Quicker was the Monza with the Road Runner slowest, but these &quot;are pretty remarkable when you consider that these are smaller, fuel-stingy engines laden with emission controls to meet today&#x27;s stringent emission requirements.&quot;

A total of 5,207 Hornet AMX were produced for the one model year, of which 3,196 had the six-cylinder and 2,011 with the V8 engine. The Hornet AMX, as well as the other similar cars from the Big Three, represented a &quot;crucial stopgap between eras&quot; from marketing muscle cars emphasizing power to offering models for customers &quot;interested sporty looks, handling packages, and cool interior spiffs.&quot;
== International markets ==
The AMC Hornet was exported to international markets, as well as assembled under license from Complete knock down (CKD) kits that were shipped from AMC&#x27;s U.S. or Canadian plants. The foreign-built cars incorporated numerous components and parts that were produced by local manufacturers to gain tax or tariff preferences.

=== Australia ===
Between 1970 and 1975, a total of 1,825 Hornets were built in right-hand-drive at the Australian Motor Industries (AMI) factory at Port Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. The initial engineering to right-hand drive and interior design was achieved firstly with South African-built Hornets and then used as the blueprint for Australian assembly. The Hornet was sold in Australia as the &quot;Rambler Hornet&quot;, only in four-door sedan body style. It was fitted with either a or six-cylinder engine and with an automatic transmission.

Australian Hornets were a model year behind the U.S. models. In other words, the 1972 Australian model was a U.S. 1971 model. However, AMI did not import the U.S. 1973 models and therefore no Hornets were assembled in Australia for 1974. Production resumed in 1975, with AMI making the U.S. 1972 model once again.

While the Hornet was the least expensive compact model in the United States, the Hornet in Australia was a luxury model, with high levels of trim, carpet, tires, and accessories. These included high-back seats, fully lined boot and covered spare wheel. The Hornet used a PBR fully assisted dual braking system, and front disc brakes from the Javelin Trans Am. The Hornet sold for $3,999 in 1970, with 407 cars being sold in Australia in that year. Sales peaked in 1971 with 597 sold. Sales dropped to 355 in 1972 and to 212 in 1973. 1974 saw 118 sales (of cars assembled in 1973.) 1975 was the Hornet&#x27;s final year in Australia, with 136 sales.

=== Costa Rica ===
Purdy Motor, which had been established in 1959 to import Toyota and AMC vehicles into Costa Rica built an assembly plant in San Jose in 1965 to assemble Toyota and AMC vehicles for the local market. They would go on to assemble the Rambler American, Classic, Ambassador, Rebel, and Javelin during this time. Assembly of the Hornet began in 1970 and was marketed as the &quot;Rambler SST.&quot;

In 1974 a new local vehicle manufacturer, Motorizada de Costa Rica, purchased the rights of Rambler distributorship from Purdy Motors. Motorizada continued to assemble AMC and Jeep vehicles as well as other brands. New for Costa Rica in 1974 was the AMC Hornet Sportabout sold locally as the AMC &quot;Unisex.&quot;

Motorizada was liquidated in 1979 allegedly for not paying taxes thereby ending the AMC brand in Costa Rica.

=== Mexico ===
American Motors had partial ownership of Vehículos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) and produced Hornets in Mexico from 1970 through 1977. The VAM-built cars continued to be called VAM Rambler following the tradition of the VAM-built Rambler American models until 1974. The Mexican models included: 
* VAM Rambler American (until 1974) – U.S. equivalent: AMC Hornet base model
* VAM Rambler American Rally – U.S. equivalent: AMC Hornet X sedan instead of hatchback
* VAM American (after 1975) – U.S. equivalent: AMC Hornet base model
* VAM American Rally – U.S. equivalent: AMC Hornet X sedan instead of hatchback
* VAM American ECD (1975–1977) – U.S. equivalent: AMC Hornet DL two-(1976 only) and four-door sedans
* VAM American GFS (1977) – U.S. equivalent: AMC Hornet DL two-door sedan, replaces two-door ECD
* VAM Camioneta American automática (1977) – U.S. equivalent: AMC Hornet DL wagon with automatic transmission

The VAM cars came with different trims and interiors than the equivalent AMC-made models. The models also combined different front clips, such as the 1977 VAM American came with the shorter U.S. and Canadian market 1977 Gremlin front-end, while its interior trim featured premium seats and upholstery. The engines in VAM models were based on AMC designs, but modified and built by VAM. Unique to Mexico included the and I6 engines. These were designed to cope with the high altitudes encountered in Mexico.

====VAM Rambler American====
The initial VAM Rambler Americans were available in a single nameless trim level (equivalent to the U.S. SST models), with only an optional performance-minded &quot;Rally&quot; package for the two-door sedans that was carried over from 1969. The model was not available with the I6 or any of the V8 engines. The performance-oriented Hornet SC/360 and Hornet AMX were not available and no Levis or Gucci trims. Legislation at the time allowed the manufacture of three body styles, thus the hatchback version was not produced in Mexico. Because of this limitation, all VAM sporty versions of the Hornet were based on the two-door sedan as AMC&#x27;s 1971–1972 counterparts. Unlike the Hornet, the now fourth-generation VAM Rambler American kept the same economy focus of its predecessor models despite its long list of standard equipment.

=====1970=====
The Hornet-based 1970 VAM Rambler American was available as a two- or four-door sedan. The standard I6 producing featured a 244-degree camshaft, 8.5:1 compression ratio, and a single-barrel Carter RBS or YF carburetor. Standards included a fully synchronized three-speed manual transmission with a column-mounted shifter, heavy-duty clutch, a 3.54:1 rear differential gear ratio, regular suspension, four-wheel drum brakes, manual steering, a four-rigid-bladed engine fan, and a regular cooling system.

Standard convenience equipment included a two-tone padded dashboard with a three-pod instrument cluster, electric windshield wipers and washers, a 200 km/h speedometer, side marker lights, four-way hazard lights, antitheft steering column locking mechanism, base steering wheel, brake system warning light, AM radio with a single in-dash speaker, front ashtray, cigarette lighter, locking glove box with &quot;RAMBLER&quot; emblem on the door, padded sunvisors, day/night rearview mirror, cardboard-type sound-absorbing and heat-isolating headliner, round dome light, dual coat hooks, flip-open rear side vents, full carpeting, driver&#x27;s side rubber floor mat sewed to the carpet, front bench seat with split folding backs on two-door sedan or with a fixed back on the four-door, bench rear seat, two-point front seatbelts, dual rear ashtrays, front and rear side armrests, vinyl and cloth upholstery on seats and side door panels, aluminum grille, backup lights, steel wheels with center hubcaps, dual &quot;232 SIX&quot; rear quarter panel emblems, dual &quot;bulleye&quot; emblems on the lower corner of the rear side vents, script &quot;American&quot; emblems on both front fenders, capital-lettered &quot;RAMBLER&quot; rectangular emblem between the right taillight and the gas filler, non-locking gas cap, manual driver&#x27;s side remote mirror, and a radio antenna.

Factory options included a heater with windshield defroster, power drum brakes, power steering, bright exterior molding package, protective side moldings, parcel shelf, courtesy lights (separate or under-shelf), full wheel covers, deluxe or sports-style steering wheel, passenger&#x27;s side remote mirror, remote-controlled driver&#x27;s side remote mirror, a bright panel between taillights, and metal bumper guards with rubber edges. Dealership accessories included a universal 6000 RPM VDO tachometer with dual hands, vinyl-covered roof with additional bright moldings, heavy-duty suspension (front sway bar and stiffer adjustable shock absorbers), a floor-mounted shifter for the three-speed transmission, front disk brakes, locking gas cap, license plate frames, mud flaps, trunk cover luggage rack, universal air conditioning system, among others.

=====1971=====
The VAM Rambler American sedans for 1971 were carried over from 1970. Enhancements included VAM&#x27;s 266-degree camshaft for the 232 I6 engine to replace AMC&#x27;s 244-degree camshaft. Despite the power increase, the official output of the engine was still at 4,400 rpm. New interior colors, side armrests, and door panel designs were available. The AM radio was updated to a newer model. The new year introduced the Hornet Sportabout-based Camioneta Rambler American. The station wagon version included the same equipment as the two sedan models with several additional features. The Camioneta Rambler American included the parcel shelf with courtesy lights as standard equipment and was the only Mexican Hornet version to be available with a three-speed automatic transmission as optional equipment. Wagons with the automatic transmission included the one-barrel 232 six, while those with a manual transmission had the 232 six with a Carter WCD carburetor.

=====1972=====
The 1972 model year VAM models incorporated the same engineering revisions and upgrades as the U.S. market AMC-built counterparts. Engines were the same as the year before with a one-barrel 232 I6 as standard on the sedans and automatic wagon and the two-barrel version for the manual transmission equipped station wagons. All featured a front sway bar as standard equipment. The 1972 models also included a new plastic grille with a revised hood latch, along with a new taillight design with larger backup lights, a new optional wheel cover design, a third AM radio model (shared with the VAM Javelin), and new interior door panels with a wood imitation rectangular portion. This was also the first year of the seatbelt warning buzzer located above the light and wiper knobs. The Camioneta Rambler American featured the Chrysler-built TorqueFlite A904 automatic transmission, replacing the previous Borg-Warner &quot;Shift-Command&quot; units.

=====1973=====
The 1973 model year VAM Hornets were redesigned and incorporated a new front-end design with larger horizontal rectangular side marker lights, semi-square headlight bezels, and a V-shaped grille and hood edge. The front bumper included AMC&#x27;s five-mile-per-hour design, but without the recovering shocks; in their place were regular rigid bumper mounts as in previous years. The automobile product standards in Mexico were less restrictive than in the U.S.; thus, VAMs mounted the bumpers placed closer to the body than their AMC counterparts. The 232 engine was replaced by the AMC I6 rated at gross with Carter RBS/YF one-barrel carburetor, 266-degree camshaft, and an 8.5:1 compression ratio. The three-speed automatic transmission finally became available in sedan models as an option and the rear differential gear ratio changed to 3.31:1 in all units. Other features included new door panels, longer and narrower inside door latches, the cigarette lighter, wiper/washer, and lights now had soft rubber knobs, modified taillight lenses, the deletion of the rectangular &quot;RAMBLER&quot; emblem in favor of &quot;American&quot; script on the rear panel, &quot;258&quot; emblems replacing the &quot;232 SIX&quot; rectangular ones and the removal of the bullseye emblems on the C-pillar base.

=====1974=====
The 1974 Rambler American was a carryover. Differences included a new rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and the rear license plate was relocated to the center of the rear panel over the gas filler. The seat and door panel designs were revised. The parking brake pedal received a new smaller rubber pad. The standard wheels were VAM&#x27;s new 14x6-inch five-spoke design with volcano hubcaps. The I6 included an evaporative canister to reduce emissions and a slightly lower 8.3:1 compression ratio. During mid-year, the compression ratio was lowered even more to 7.6:1. Nevertheless, the engines continued to be rated at .

====VAM American====
The introduction of the Gremlin line by VAM in 1974, became the company&#x27;s smallest and most affordable model. There was a gap between the lower-end Rambler American line and the larger, top Classic (Matador) line. The difference in size and engine series between the Rambler American and the Gremlin was not enough for VAM to create the impression of a more solid and more diverse product line since both cars were perceived as belonging to the same economy class, which would produce internal competition. The VAM Rambler American was restricted to the economy segment since its introduction to the Mexican market, the only exceptions to this being the luxury limited edition Rambler American Hardtop (Rambler American 440H in the US) for 1963 and 1965, as well as the sporty Rambler American Rally (Rambler American Rogue and Hornet Rallye X/Hornet X in the US) from 1969 through 1974. The model was shifted from the economy to the mid-segment, as an all-new generation was introduced in 1975. This repositioned the company&#x27;s full product line and rejuvenated the compact line. The Hornet-based Rambler American had been on the market for five years and saw continued sales and a positive image. The name was simplified from Rambler American to just American, marking the discontinuation of the Rambler brand in Mexico. A new luxury American ECD trim level was followed by a revised and improved American Rally and American base models. These differentiated the line from the Gremlin. All versions obtained updates and upgrades.

=====1975=====
The American base model in its first year was characterized by incorporating all-new rectangular amber parking lights, a grille divided into six squared portions, and more hexagonal-lined headlight bezels. Manual front disk brakes were standard (although a few units with the manual transmission still had front drums installed) and the I6 engine featured Prestolite electronic ignition. This engine was carried over with a 7.6:1 compression ratio, 266-degree camshaft, , and a single-barrel Carter YF or RBS carburetor. Interiors included new door panels available in either a solid color or two-tone alongside new seat patterns. The two-tone dashboard was replaced by a color-keyed unit with a new &quot;American&quot; emblem on the glove box door and a standard fuel economy gauge. Cars equipped with automatic transmission included a heater and power steering at no extra cost.

=====1976=====
The 1976 models were almost the same as their immediate predecessors; their differences were limited to a compression ratio increase for the I6 from 7.6:1 to 8.0:1. New gauges appeared in the form of a 160 km/h speedometer and revised warning lights, sun visors were redesigned to larger more rectangular units with side bending portions, a new more-ornate dome light lens, new seat, and door panel designs, while a rear defroster was added to the options. The separate seatbelt warning buzzer between the wipers and lights knobs was discontinued. New full-rubber bumper guards became available alongside the already existing metal ones with rubber strips.

=====1977=====
The 1977 models included a facelift that AMC originally intended to be exclusive to the Gremlin line. The design included a new front bumper, squared headlight bezels with rounded corners, and an egg-crate smile-shaped grille that incorporated the rectangular parking lights from the previous two years. An &quot;American&quot; emblem was mounted on the right front edge of the hood. The two-point seatbelts were upgraded to fixed three-point units on both sedan models. Station wagons included three-point retractable units as standard. The Carter RBS carburetor was discontinued leaving the YF model on the I6. Two-door sedans with manual transmissions now featured a floor-mounted gearshift with low-back fold-down individual seats, while models with automatic transmissions retained the bench seat with split-folding backs and a column-mounted shifter. Manual transmission cars incorporated a safety lock lever in their steering column ignition switch shared with the American Rally model. The seats and door panels were slightly modified from the last year. A new &quot;American&quot; emblem with different typography was applied to the glove box door. The &quot;258&quot; rear quarter panel emblems were replaced by new &quot;4.2&quot; versions. Although VAM introduced a factory factory-installed air conditioning system for its 1977 model year cars, it was not available for the American series. The objective was to offer it in high-trim and performance models. However, VAM dealerships could install a universal air conditioning system for non-factory-built units.

====Rambler American Rally====
The sporty Rambler American Rally package was originally introduced in 1969 for the third-generation Rambler American two-door sedan as a more economical sporty alternative to the muscular VAM Javelin and personal luxury VAM Rambler Classic SST (Rebel SST hardtop). With the arrival of the new Hornet-based models for 1970, the package was continued and improved, containing not just more regular production accessories but also all-new exclusive ones. The Rambler American Rally model was available a full year ahead of AMC&#x27;s Hornet SC/360 and two years ahead of the Hornet X and Hornet Rallye-X models, making it the first-ever performance product based on the Hornet.

The package started with an exclusive engine, the high-performance 9.8:1 compression ratio I6 with Carter WCD carburetor and 266-degree camshaft designed by VAM&#x27;s engineering department. Other features included a black two-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bullseye emblem, wide reclining individual front seats, floor-mounted Hurst Performance shifter 150-T three-speed manual transmission with a locking mechanism connected to the steering wheel ignition switch, full bright molding package including rear panel overlay between the taillights and two courtesy lights. Unlike the 1969 version, power drum brakes were no longer included, but optional.

The Rambler American Rally for 1971 was almost equal to the previous year&#x27;s counterpart. The script for the &quot;American&quot; fender emblems was replaced by new script &quot;Rally&quot; emblems to differentiate the 1971 from the 1970 models. The front seat controls were revised with a new knob placed on the outer side of each seatback, new &quot;mushroom&quot;-shaped armrests with a central horizontal bright molding, new side panels with simulated stitches, and a steering wheel design similar to the previous one but incorporating three false spokes per arm instead of the smooth soft surface. A new AM monaural radio model replaced the previous unit that was used since 1966 Rambler American and Classic models.

The success of the Rally package made VAM use it as a trim level for 1972 along with improvements. The safety mechanism connecting the shifter to the ignition switch was discontinued and replaced with a small safety lever on the side of the column to keep the ignition switch from accidentally turning into the lock position with the vehicle still in motion. The previously optional 8000 RPM tachometer became standard equipment along with AMC&#x27;s new three-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a round center horn button. Low-back, smaller more bucket-like front reclining seats replaced the wide units of the previous two years, which meant a free space between both units over the transmission tunnel. The round floor shift base shared with 1968–1969 Javelins departed in favor of a new squared design. The bright rear panel got an aluminum-turned appearance and the taillight lenses featured a new larger backup light and side stripes. The grille was changed from aluminum to plastic and an updated hood latch appeared. The front sway bar became standard. The 1972 Rally engine was the VAM I6 producing at 4,600 rpm, 9.5:1 compression ratio and the 266-degree camshaft, which was originally used in 1969–1970 VAM Javelins and 1970-1971 Rambler Classics (Rebel and Matador). Unlike the exclusive high-performance version of the 1970-1971 232 Rally engine, the 252 six was a regular production unit. The only exception to this was the exclusive high-flow version of the Carter RBS single-barrel carburetor, named Carter RBS-PV1, developed by VAM&#x27;s engineers. The &quot;232 SIX&quot; emblems were replaced in favor of new &quot;252&quot; units.

For 1973, VAM sought to standardize and consolidate as many parts and components to cut costs. Both the 232 and 252 engine series were discontinued in favor of the higher-output , 8.5:1 compression ratio AMC I6 with VAM&#x27;s 266-degree camshaft and single-barrel Carter RBS or YF carburetor. The engine now shared the same crankshaft as VAM&#x27;s new I6 was introduced in the 1971 VAM Javelin model, allowing VAM to optimize resources and reduce costs. The rear differential gear ratio changed from 3.54:1 to 3.31:1. The taillights were revised. High-back bucket seats were available which were shared with the second-generation VAM Javelin. Unlike previous seat backs, these did not include a reclining mechanism. New side panel designs accompanied a now standard parcel shelf incorporating both courtesy lights. The front-end was completely updated as in the standard Rambler American models except for the unique characteristic of the blackout grille. The engine displacement emblems changed the last digit to eight while keeping the same design as last year&#x27;s units. The rectangular &quot;Rambler&quot; rear emblem was removed and its place was taken by the manuscript &quot;Rally&quot; unit that was no longer on the front fenders.

The 1974 Rallys were mostly unchanged from the 1973s. Just like on the Rambler American, their largest difference was the new rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and relocated rear license plate. These models incorporated the first set of VAM&#x27;s original five-spoke wheels, which carried full volcano-shaped hubcaps and trim rings. Wheel covers were not available for this model. For the first time, a set of factory side stripes decorated the exterior of the model including a manuscript &quot;Rally&quot; emblem on the rear quarter panel, creating a two-tone appearance. The front seats were the same as the year before and were now also shared with the brand-new Classic AMX (Matador X) model. The discontinuation of the original VAM logo during 1973 in favor of the new arrow-type one meant its removal from the dial of the tachometer. The shifter was changed into a T-shaped Hurst unit. A new AMC logo over a black background replaced the American Motors script over the transparent acrylic cap on the steering wheel&#x27;s horn button. The compression ratio of the 258 six engines was reduced from 8.5:1 to 8.3:1.

====American Rally====
The new marketing concept for VAM&#x27;s compact model was also included for its sporty version. This started with the change in name from Rambler American Rally to American Rally. For the first time, VAM sought to reposition the model higher from the economical sporty model status it pioneered. This meant a focus on sportiness as well as on luxury.

The 1975 American Rally alongside its new name obtained its first redesign of identity emblems in the form of an all-new &quot;RALLY&quot; nameplate in printing letters connected by a background line. Like the former one, it was located on the rear panel between the right taillight and rear license plate. A new grille, headlight bezels, and parking lights shared with the American and Gremlin lines were now in blackout form. New side decals were discreet lines running the full length of the car without changing proportions and incorporating Rally emblems on the front fenders. The interior for the first time was different from that of the American model other than the front seats. Rally emblems appeared etched on the front high corners of the side panels. All previously exposed metal parts like the top of the doors, rear sides, and B pillar were now upholstered in vinyl. The &quot;RAMBLER&quot; emblem on the glove box was replaced by a &quot;RALLY&quot; one of the same design. Unlike all of its predecessors, a considerable amount of 1975 American Rally units were equipped with the heater as standard. The aspect that made the American Rally the most different from the last generation was the mechanicals. The 258 six-cylinder obtained an all-new electronic ignition system sourced by Prestolite. Manual front disk brakes replaced the previous drums. A new TREMEC 170-F four-speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage came from the factory, although VAM was not able to fully standardize it and several Hurst-linked three-speed 1975 American Rally versions were built.

Since 1973, the growing problem of air pollution (especially in Mexico City) forced the Mexican government to begin emission certification of all engines produced in the country starting in 1974. This would affect all high-compression engines of all marques. For this reason, the I6 had dropped from an 8.5:1 to 8.3:1 compression ratio in the change between 1973 and 1974. However, this change was not enough to comply with the government standards and VAM was forced to decrease compression even more in mid-1974. This meant a final 7.6:1 compression ratio for the I6 for the second half of the year production of the 1974 Rambler American Rally. For this reason, the aforementioned model along with the 1975 American Rally became the lowest-performing examples of VAM&#x27;s original compact sporty model, ending even below the standard I6 of the 1969 Rambler American Rally and the stock 232 1970–1972 Rambler American two-door sedans. Improvements in the form of the four-speed transmission and electronic ignition were insufficient.

In 1976, VAM introduced the Gremlin X in Mexico, retaking the economical sporty concept originally held by the Rally model. Engineers improved the output of the I6 without rising gas emissions with a higher, 8.0:1 compression ratio. This, along with the subcompact&#x27;s lighter body, made the 1976 Gremlin X outperform the low-compression 1975 American Rally even though it was not offered with the new four-speed transmission. To avoid internal competition in both performance models as well as further pushing the line&#x27;s concept change, VAM proceeded to upgrade the American Rally to differentiate it from the new subcompact version. The 1976 models switched to the 7.7:1 compression ratio VAM I6 with Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor and 266-degree camshaft, shared with the VAM Pacer and all Classic models. This marked for the first time the presence of VAM&#x27;s largest engine in the Hornet-based compact line. Changes to the 258 six were still in process as well for the 282, thus the existing version was continued. The 1976 American Rally had improved performance with its higher displacement, large-diameter valves, larger intake manifold, and larger carburetor. The model outperformed its predecessors except for the 1972 Rambler American Rally with its 9.5:1 compression ratio 252 cu in six, which was still half a second faster despite its high-flow one-barrel carburetor, small intake manifold, three-speed transmission, higher numerical rear gear ratio, and lower displacement.

Additionally, the 1976 American Rally included improvements consisting of power front disk brakes, power steering, and tinted windshield, as standard equipment. The four-speed transmission and heater were also standard. New seat patterns and door panel designs (without the etched Rally emblem) were used, while gauges were changed to a 160 km/h speedometer and 6,000 RPM tachometer. New dome light lens design and longer sun visors were shared with the American and Gremlin. The new engine and standard equipment coupled with the mid-year discontinuation of the 1976 Classic AMX (Matador X) made the American Rally the top-of-the-line performance model of the company. The sportiness and concept were fairly close to that of the 1972–1976 VAM Javelins and Classic AMXs. With the engine change, the rear quarter panel emblems morphed into &quot;4.6&quot; units. After only one year, the model name &quot;Rally&quot; emblem on the rear panel was once again redesigned.

The 1977 models incorporated engineering upgrades for the 258 six the year before to the 282 engine. All-new head design with quench-type combustion chambers took the compression ratio from 7.7:1 to 8.0:1. It was accompanied by a new aluminum intake manifold with improved flow while continuing the Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. These improvements made the 1977 American Rally the best-performing model of its series, even surpassing the high-compression 1972 model. Despite this, advertised horsepower and torque ratings were the same as the year before. The power increase allowed the use of a new 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for better economy and top speed without losing acceleration and towing capacity. The front high-back bucket seats obtained new patterns and for the first time since the 1972 reclining mechanism (as standard equipment), three-point front seatbelts with double retractable mechanisms were added, a new VAM-designed digital tachometer took the place of the conventional analog unit in the midyear. The exterior featured the new Gremlin front clip. New decals covering only the front fenders on their topsides started near the doors to the side front marker lights, between the lights and stripe was a &quot;Rally 4.6&quot; sticker. Like the three luxury versions of the line for the year, the 1977 American Rally was the first unit of its series to offer the original factory air conditioning system as an option. The hood and trunk lights as well as the glove box unit were added to the standard equipment list.

The Rally included D70x14 radial tires in all years and rear gear ratios of 3.54:1 (1970–1972), 3.31:1 (1973–1976), and 3.07:1 (1977). The American Rally was discontinued in 1977 along with all other Hornet-based VAM Americans. It would find a successor in the 1978 American Rally AMX model (VAM&#x27;s version of the 1978 AMC Concord AMX), meaning the production in Mexico for the first time of AMC&#x27;s hatchback coupe body style. Unlike the AMC Hornet X models, neither the Hornet-based Rambler American Rally and American Rally were ever available with V8 engines, automatic transmissions, or column-mounted shifters. The Rally model was more than just an appearance package, but was also not as strong as a muscle car finds its closest American equivalent in the form of the 1972 Hornet Rallye-X model. It is regarded as one of VAM&#x27;s most collectible models.

====American ECD====
As part of the shift in market strategy for VAM&#x27;s Hornet-based compacts for 1975 that included advancements in the American base model and American Rally was the introduction of the new American ECD or &quot;Edición Cantos Dorados&quot; (English: Golden Edges Edition). It represented for the first time a VAM four-door compact was not an economy base model. The American ECD was VAM&#x27;s first regular production luxury compact as previously it was only a limited edition of the two-door hardtop in 1963 and 1965 as the Rambler American Hardtop (equivalent to the Rambler American 440H in the US and Canada). The ECD was restricted to the four-door sedan while the 1975 American Rally was the high-trim two-door sedan. The station wagon remained a single-edition model. The American ECD was equivalent in the U.S. to the 1975 four-door Hornet DL model.

The 1975 American ECD came standard with a I6 engine with a single-barrel Carter carburetor, electronic ignition, 266-degree camshaft, and 7.6:1 compression ratio with a regular cooling system. Included were manual front disk brakes with rear drums, power steering, heavy-duty suspension with front sway bar, Chrysler TorqueFlite A904 three-speed automatic transmission, and a 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. The exterior included a full vinyl roof with bright moldings, regular bright molding package (wheel lip, rocker panels, drip rails, and between taillights molding), luxury wheel covers, &quot;American&quot; and &quot;Automático&quot; emblems on the rear panel, &quot;258&quot; emblems on rear quarter panels, and golden &quot;ECD&quot; emblems over the base of the C-pillars. Standard equipment also consisted of front and rear bench seats, front two-point seatbelts, front and rear armrests, luxury upholstery, custom steering wheel, column-mounted shifter, color-keyed padded dashboard, gauges for fuel and coolant temperature as well as warning lights (brakes, oil, and electrical system), a 200 km/h speedometer, vacuum gauge, front ashtray, cigarette lighter, heater with front defroster, AM monaural radio with a single speaker and antenna, locking glove box, parcel shelf, courtesy lights, padded sun visors, day/night rearview mirror, heat and sound insulating cardboard-type headliner, round dome light, dual coat hooks, rear ashtray mounted on the front seatback, and driver&#x27;s side remote mirror. Optional equipment included passenger&#x27;s side mirror, remote-controlled driver&#x27;s side mirror, power brakes, bumper guards, tinted windshield, light group, and others.

The 1976 American ECD included the same upgrades as the rest of the American line. These were longer sun visors, a 160 km/h speedometer, a new dome light lens, and a higher 8.0:1 compression ratio on the 258 six. A rear defroster was added to the options list while the tinted windshield became standard. The luxury seat patterns and wheel covers were redesigned. An electric analog clock appeared to the right of the speedometer, although several models kept the vacuum gauge. A new model for the year was the two-door American ECD. This model was a limited edition luxury American two-door sedan, comparable to the Rambler American Hardtop of the 1960s. The equipment was the same as the four-door American ECD with some differences. The engine on this model was the I6 featuring a Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor, 7.7:1 compression ratio, 266-degree camshaft, and electronic ignition. The automatic transmission was a floor-mounted shift design, a first in a VAM Hornet-based American. The front seats were upgraded to high-back individual non-reclining units instead of the four-door bench.

The American ECD was once again restricted to the four-door sedan only for 1977. The model incorporated the new Gremlin front clip like the rest of the American line of the year. The &quot;258&quot; engine displacement emblems were replaced by new &quot;4.2&quot; units and the bumper guards were included at no charge. Power brakes were made standard. Most of the light group was also installed as standard which added illumination for the engine, trunk, and glove box. The electric clock was fully standardized in all units. Front seat belts were upgraded into three-point retractable units. The rear seatback received a concealed fold-down armrest. AMC&#x27;s factory air conditioning system was added to the options. The Carter RBS one-barrel carburetor was discontinued leaving only the Carter YF model.

====American GFS and Camioneta Automática====
VAM executives and engineers sought to move the two-door 1976 American ECD from the limited edition status into a regular production model, and also change its concept from a general luxury into a personal luxury vehicle, which VAM no longer offered since the mid-1976 discontinuation of the Classic Brougham (Matador Brougham coupe) model. Taking advantage of this upcoming new model was a plan of this group of employees to pay homage to VAM&#x27;s general manager Gabriel Fernández Sáyago, one of the most respected men in the Mexican auto industry at the time and leader of the company since 1946. The new personal luxury compact was named after him using his initials as a designation. The model was presented to him as a surprise in late 1976, which he appreciated highly but opting for a more humble stance, he requested the model not to carry his name. The group of VAM employees respected his decision, but managed an indirect way to keep their original plan. The general manager&#x27;s initials were retained, but the meaning was changed to &quot;Grand Formula Sport.&quot; The model was introduced along with VAM&#x27;s 1977 lineup as a two-door alternative to the American ECD and a luxury one to the sporty American Rally.

The 1977 American GFS incorporated the same appearance and equipment novelties as the American ECD of the same year. Like the two-door 1976 American ECD, the model kept the individual front seat and floor-mounted automatic transmission configuration, with the notable difference of incorporating reclining mechanisms as standard equipment. From this model, the I6 was also retained, but incorporating the new head and intake manifold designs as well as the 3.07:1 rear gear ratio from the American Rally model of the year. Unique to the 1977 American GFS was its design of rear side windows and roof. VAM designers created a half Landau-type vinyl-covered roof that included the Targa band AMC used for the 1977 Hornet AMX models and shortened flip-open rear side windows creating a thicker B-pillar. American Motors adopted this design for its 1978 and 1979 Concord DL/Limited two-door models, but without the Targa trim.

New for 1977 was VAM&#x27;s first station wagon that was not an economy-based model, the first in 17 years. This model was not a new trim level, but a package included with the order of the automatic transmission. Like the American GFS, the engine changed from the I6 to the version with a 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio. Like the American ECD, it shared the column-mounted gearshift, high-trim-upholstered bench seats (fold-down rear unit), and special door panels. Shared with both luxury sedans were power brakes, power steering, heavy-duty suspension, bumper guards, full bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, &quot;4.6&quot; emblems (GFS only), tinted windshield, luxury steering wheel, electric analog clock, parcel shelf, full light group (except reading dome light) as well as other updates for the model year. This created a luxury wagon for the first time in VAM&#x27;s lineup. However, the low-priced base wagon was no longer available with an automatic transmission. VAM wagons with this package did not have a name because it was not a trim level, but VAM and printed materials described it as the &quot;Camioneta Automática&quot; (automatic wagon). Starting in 1979, and based on the U.S. market Concord station wagon, it was officially named &quot;American DL&quot;.

===South Africa===
South Africa was the first international market that AMC entered the right-hand drive production of the Hornet. Before the Hornet, the Rambler American was assembled in South Africa first by National Motor Assemblers Limited (NMA) in Durban and in 1968 at the Datsun assembly plant Rosslyn Motor Assemblers. In 1969 Rambler production was moved to the former Chrysler plant, Motor Assemblies Limited (MA) in Durban which had come under the control of Toyota South Africa in 1964.

Motor Assemblies Limited built the American for its final year and in 1970 was its replacement the AMC Hornet 4-door sedan. The initial design and engineering work to right-hand drive conversion for South Africa became the blueprints used right-hand drive Hornets that were assembled in Australia. As with all AMC&#x27;s export markets, the Hornet was marketed in South Africa as &quot;Rambler.&quot;

The Rambler Hornet was advertised as being &quot;built and marketed in South Africa by Toyota South Africa Ltd, wholly owned and controlled by South Africans ... sold and serviced country-wide by 220 Toyota dealers.&quot; The Hornet was marketed through 1971.

American Motors South Africa (Proprietary) Limited was the official license holder for the production of the Rambler Hornet at the Motor Assemblies plant. However, latter production was hampered by problems arising from regulations. The nation&#x27;s tariff structure considered only the weight of parts or materials made in South Africa would be calculated toward local content requirements. The objective was to increase indigenous production. As a result, the last of the South African-built Rambler Hornets came equipped with Chevrolet straight-6 engines. The objective was to standardize the manufacture of vehicle components within South Africa. Because of this, the Hornet&#x27;s original AMC engine was eliminated from the marketplace, while the switch also provided greater local production volume for the General Motors engine.

A total of 840 Hornets were built at the Motor Assemblies plant.

== Motorsports ==
AMC Hornets were campaigned in various motorsports events. Some technical and financial support was provided by the automaker in the early years.

=== Stock Car Racing ===
Bobby Allison was AMC&#x27;s factory-backed NASCAR driver, racing #12 AMC Matadors fielded by Roger Penske. Allison also participated in short-track racing, often using a modified stock car that he re-bodied using the Hornet&#x27;s sheet metal, painted in the AMC&#x27;s red/white/blue racing livery and numbered 12.

=== Drag racing ===
Hornets were campaigned on dragstrips from 1972 and became well known by their bold red, white, and blue graphics. Dave Street was an early Hornet racer in Northeast Pro Stock events. Drivers on the Pro Stock circuit included Wally Booth (backed by AMC until 1974), as well as Rich Maskin and Dave Kanners captured top awards. Booth drove a Hornet to the top qualifying spot at the 1975 NHRA U.S. Nationals.

Some drivers converted from AMC Gremlins when tests with identical engines in 1973 showed that the hatchback Hornet had an advantage with higher speeds and lower times. The 1974 Gatornationals, as well as the 1976 NHRA U.S. Nationals and the World Finals were won by Wally Booth driving an AMC Hornet. The Hornets would do the quarter-mile in 8 seconds reaching .

The last AMC Pro Stocker was campaigned through the 1982 season in American Hot Rod Association events. It was a Hornet AMX with nitrous injection.

=== Endurance ===
In 1970, Lou Haratz drove an AMC Hornet over to set a new Trans-Americas record by going from Ushuaia, Argentina to Fairbanks, Alaska in 30 days and 45 minutes. He also went on to be the first to drive completely around the widest practical perimeter of the North, Central, and South American continents for a distance of in 143 days. The Hornet received a tune-up service in Caracas as well as in Lima, and the endurance record was promoted in various popular magazine advertisements for Champion spark plugs that were standard equipment in AMC engines.

=== IMSA racing ===
From 1971 the AMC Hornet was campaigned in the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) races. Hornets ran in GTO class (Grand Touring type with engines of 2.5 L or more) and American Challenge (AC) class. American Motors provided only limited support in the form of technical help. The cars were gutted and powered by highly modified AMC 232 straight-six engines.

In 1973, AMC cars very nearly placed 1-2-3, in a BF Goodrich Radial Challenge Series race, but Bob Hennig driving an AMC Hornet went out while in third place with only six laps to go. BMW driver Nick Craw and AMC Hornet driver Amos Johnson ended the IMSA series as co-champions in Class B.

On 6 February 1977, out of 57 cars that started the 24-Hours of Daytona, Championship of Makes, at Daytona International Speedway, an AMC Hornet driven by Tom Waugh, John Rulon-Miller, and Bob Punch drove car #15 to 22nd place overall and 12th in the GTO class by completing 394 laps in .

Amos Johnson drove car #7, an AC Class Hornet, in the 100-mile Road Atlanta race on 17 April 1977, as well as with co-driver Dennis Shaw to finish 11th in the Hallett Motor Racing Circuit on 24 July 1977.

A 1977 Hornet AMX was prepared by &quot;Team Highball&quot; from North Carolina and driven by Amos Johnson and Dennis Shaw. Car #77 finished in 34th place in the GTO class out of the 68 that started the race by completing 475 laps, in the 17th Annual 24 Hours of Daytona Camel GT Challenge.

The AMC cars &quot;were killers at places like Daytona. Despite being about as aerodynamic as a brick they had those nice, big, reliable straight sixes ...&quot;

=== SCCA Trans Am ===
Buzz Dyer drove a 1977 AMC Hornet AMX (car #77) with a V8 engine in the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans Am events at the Laguna Seca Raceway on 8 October 1978 and finished 46 laps.

=== Coast-to-coast run ===
Two &quot;Hot Rod&quot; staffers, John Fuchs and Clyde Baker, entered a 1972 AMC Hornet in the Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash. This was an unofficial automobile race from New York City and Darien, CT, on the U.S. Atlantic coast, to Redondo Beach, a Los Angeles suburb on the Pacific coast during the time of the newly imposed speed limit set by the National Maximum Speed Law. The Hornet X hatchback was modified with a AMC V8 and auxiliary racing fuel cells to increase gasoline capacity. They finished in 13th place after driving for 41 hours and 15 minutes at an average speed of .

== In popular culture ==
As part of a significant product placement movie appearance by AMC, a 1974 Hornet X Hatchback is featured in the James Bond film: &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, where Roger Moore made his second appearance as the British secret agent.

The film&#x27;s &quot;most outrageous sequence&quot; begins with Sheriff J.W. Pepper, who, on holiday in Thailand with his wife, is admiring a new, red AMC Hornet in a Bangkok showroom. He is about to test drive the car. The action begins as James Bond commandeers the Hornet from the dealership with Pepper in it for a car chase. The Hornet performs an &quot;airborne pirouette as it makes a hold-your-breath jump across a broken bridge&quot;.

The stunt car is significantly modified with a redesigned chassis to place the steering wheel in the center and a lower stance, as well as larger wheel wells, compared to the stock Hornet used in all the other movie shots. The 360-degree mid-air twisting corkscrew was captured in just one filming sequence. Seven tests were performed in advance before the one jump performed by an uncredited British stuntman &quot;Bumps&quot; Williard for the film with six (or eight, depending on the source) cameras simultaneously rolling. Two frogmen were positioned in the water, as well as an emergency vehicle and a crane were ready, but not needed. The Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory (CAL) was used for computer modeling to calculate the stunt. The modeling called for a weight of both the car and driver, the exact angles of the ramps, and the distance between the ramps, as well as the launch speed.

This stunt was adapted from Jay Milligan&#x27;s Astro Spiral Javelin show cars. These were jumps performed in AMC-sponsored thrill shows at fairs around the US, including the Houston Astrodome, where Gremlins and Hornets were also used to drive around in circles on their side two wheels in the arena. Using exactly the same ramp design, movie set designers made the ramps look convincingly like a rickety old bridge that was falling apart. However, the movie&#x27;s director ruined the continuous spiral effect of the stunt. By cutting camera shots as the car was in mid-air, they made it look like trick photography to get the car upside-down rather than filming it as one continuous jump.

Months of difficult work went into the scene that lasts only fifteen seconds in the movie. The &quot;Guinness World Records 2010&quot; book describes this &quot;revolutionary jump&quot; as the &quot;first astro spiral used in a movie&quot; and lists it as third among the top ten James Bond film stunts.

The actual Bond Hornet was preserved in the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu, UK together with other famous items owned by the Ian Fleming Foundation and used in the 007 films. In 2017, the car stunt car &quot;in operable and in as-jumped condition&quot; was auctioned by the museum.

The AMC Hornet is one of Hagerty&#x27;s favorite Bond cars for vintage automobile collectors on a budget. Several scale models of the AMC Hornet are available including the James Bond hatchback versions made by Corgi Toys and Johnny Lightning.

== Experimental Hornets ==
The AMC Hornet served as a vehicle for several experimental alternative fuel and power sources.

=== Gas turbine ===
In the aftermath of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, research grants were funded by the U.S. government to further develop automotive gas turbine technology. This included conceptual design studies and vehicles for improved passenger-car gas-turbine systems that were conducted by Chrysler, General Motors (through its Detroit Diesel Allison Division), Ford in collaboration with AiResearch, and Williams Research teamed with American Motors. In 1971, a long-term test was conducted to evaluate actual road experience with a turbine-powered passenger car. An AMC Hornet was converted to a WR-26 regenerative gas turbine power made by Williams International.

A small-sized Williams gas turbine engine powered 1973 Hornet was used by New York City to evaluate comparable cost efficiency with piston engines and funded by a grant from the National Air Pollution Control Administration, a predecessor of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The city was interested in &quot;solving the air quality problems that New Yorkers were beginning to notice.&quot; The Hornet&#x27;s experimental power source was developed by inventor Sam B. Williams. Weighing in at and measuring by by , it produced at 4450 rpm with a clean exhaust. The engines performed well in theory and ran well, especially during tests on the Michigan International Speedway, but the cars needed more work to be adapted to the turbine engine for city driving and lacked the refinement of the purpose-built Chrysler Turbine Car.

=== Gasoline direct injection ===
Research to develop a Straticharge Continuous Fuel-Injection (SCFI) system (an early gasoline direct injection (GDI) design) was conducted with the backing of AMC. The Hornet&#x27;s conventional spark-ignited internal combustion I6 engine was a modified with a redesigned cylinder head. Road testing was performed using a 1973 AMC Hornet. This SCFI system was a mechanical device that automatically responded to the engine&#x27;s airflow and loading conditions with two separate fuel-control pressures supplied to two sets of continuous-flow injectors. It was &quot;a dual-chamber, three-valve, fuel-injected, stratified-charge&quot; engine. Flexibility was designed into the SCFI system for trimming it to a particular engine.

=== Hybrid ===
In 1976, the California Air Resources Board bought and converted AMC Hornets for its design research into hybrids.

===Natural gas===
The Consumers Gas Company (now Consumers Energy) operated a fleet of 1970 AMC Hornets converted to a dual-fuel system that was capable of using gasoline as well as compressed natural gas (CNG). This was an early demonstration project for clean and efficient vehicles.

===Plug-in electric===
In 1971, the Electric Fuel Propulsion Company began marketing the Electrosport, a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) based on the Hornet Sportabout wagon. It was designed to be a supplementary battery electric vehicle for commuting or daily chores, and to be recharged at home using household current or at &quot;Charge Stations away from home to replenish power in 45 minutes, while you shop or have lunch.&quot;

===LaForce Ventur-E===
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted extensive tests of 1974 and 1975 AMC Hornets to evaluate the fuel economy claims made for the LaForce Ventur-E modifications. The LaForce prepared Hornet included a special carburetor that was designed to vary the fuel to air mixture under all operating conditions. Other modifications were made to the camshaft, a smaller combustion area, special &quot;dual&quot; exhaust manifolds, and the installation of solid valve lifters (in place of the standard hydraulic tappets). The manifold was designed to intercept gasoline between the carburetor and engine and &quot;to use even the harder to burn heavy gasoline molecules&quot; – thus, claiming mileage increases of 40 to 57%. However, the EPA tests did not fully support the performance and economy claims that were to be achieved by these modifications in comparison to standard factory tuned vehicles.

==Concept cars==
The AMC Hornet platform served as the basis for evaluating design and styling ideas by AMC. In the late-2000s, the Hornet name was revived for a Dodge concept car.

===Cowboy===
Although both predecessor companies (Nash and Hudson) had built work trucks, the merged successor (American Motors Corporation) never developed and marketed a truck line until it purchased Jeep. In the early 1970s, AMC was planning a compact coupé utility (pickup) based on the Hornet to compete with the increasing sales of Japanese compact pickup models.

Work began by having the Jeep styling studio convert a Hornet into a pickup with three objectives: to compete in size with the imported trucks, rival the Chevrolet El Camino in appearance, and have a lower cost than both of them. A further goal was to achieve the most return from AMC&#x27;s $40 million investment in engineering and production dies needed to bring the sleek Hornet compact to market.

Prototypes called the Cowboy were developed under the leadership of Jim Alexander. The first proposal had an El Camino design with a &quot;sweeping panel from the rear of the cab, flowing into and becoming the side of the truck bed.&quot; This would have been expensive to develop so Alexander, an AMC product planner, proposed a separate cargo bed mounted on a stub frame serving for the rear half of the unibody vehicle with a gas tank from an Ambassador welded under the front half of the cargo bed and the spare tire fitting under the back half.

Documentation from the development process indicates three prototypes with a Hornet-based cab, Jeep-style grille treatments, and a Gremlin version. The initial design called for a cargo box and the prototype used the front doors from a four-door Hornet. This short cab version was not effective and the cab was opened up by incorporating the longer two-door sedan doors along with a new upper window frame and a &quot;K-pillar effect&quot; that improved the design and for better sight lines. One prototype vehicle that was painted red featured a modified AMC Gremlin front design and a cargo box with a Jeep logo on the tailgate, but did not include a four-wheel-drive system. A prototype finished in green and white was made using a Hornet SC/360 that featured the V8 engine with a floor-mounted manual transmission, radio, air conditioning, and a drop-down tailgate with no manufacturer&#x27;s name stamped on it. The third prototype had a Gremlin front-end, was painted yellow, and had a I-6 engine. The basic AMC engines would be more powerful than the typical 4-cylinders found in the imported pickups.
American Motors was also developing a hatchback version of the Hornet. However, AMC&#x27;s assembly plants in Kenosha and Milwaukee were already running at maximum capacity so the chosen body style would be built in Brampton, Ontario. With the increasing sales of the Hornet models, the 1970 acquisition of Jeep, and no 4WD option ready for the Cowboy (at the time all Jeeps were 4WD), AMC&#x27;s product planners shelved the Cowboy truck program. A 4WD system was developed and later used on the 1980 AMC Eagle, and the &quot;uniframe&quot; construction (&quot;frame&quot; rails under the truck bed made of folded sheet metal and incorporated into the cab structure as one piece) was incorporated in the structure of the 1985 Jeep Comanche pickup, based on the unit body XJ Cherokee.

The only surviving prototype was built using a 1971 Hornet SC/360 with the 360 V8 and a four-speed manual transmission. The automaker used it on their proving grounds for several years before being sold to Alexander, who later installed a 1973 Hornet updated front-end.

===Hornet GT===
In 1973, the Hornet GT toured auto shows as an asymmetrical styling exercise. The left (or driver&#x27;s) side featured more glass area and a narrower &quot;C&quot; pillar for better visibility in comparison to the concept car&#x27;s different design on its right side. Using different designs on each side is common practice within automobile styling studios, especially when money was tight; however, showing such an example to the public was unusual and AMC was not afraid to measure consumer reaction to new ideas. Other design elements and ideas presented on the Hornet GT show car included sealed glass to allowing hollow doors that could house easily accessible components while freeing up space in the dashboard area, as well as a stronger roof and support pillars providing additional crash and rollover protection.

=== Hornet by Dodge ===

A mini-sized front-wheel-drive, concept car called Hornet was designed and developed by Dodge in 2006 for possible production in 2008 as the brand was entering European markets and attracting younger customers. As the price of fuel increased, Chrysler continued work to launch the Hornet in 2010 in Europe, the United States and other markets. This Hornet project may have been cancelled as part of Fiat&#x27;s partnership with Chrysler; but it was also rumored that the Hornet nameplate would instead be applied to a small Dodge sedan slated for introduction in 2012 based on the same &quot;C-Evo&quot; platform as the Alfa Romeo Giulietta.

In October 2011, Chrysler trademarked four names: Hornet, Dart, Duster, and Camber. One month later, the head of the Dodge brand, Reid Bigland, stated that Hornet would not be used for the new car. The automaker &quot;surprised industry pundits and insiders&quot; with an announcement that the small sedan for 2013 will be called the Dodge Dart (PF). For a long time, both company insiders and industry experts &quot;had insisted that the compact Dodge would be called the Dodge Hornet, in homage not only to the well-received 2006 concept car that carried the name but also to an ancestry of vehicles stretching back 60 years to the original Hudson Hornet.&quot;

=== Dodge Hornet ===

For the 2023 model year, Dodge revived the Hornet nameplate by introducing a compact crossover car. The historic name uses the same platform as the Alfa Romeo Tonale, but the Dodge version targets the performance market segment. The Dodge Hornet builds on the Hudson Hornet, the AMC Hornet, and the Hornet by Dodge concept car image to focus the new Hornet as part of the &quot;Brotherhood of Muscle&quot; marketing.

<doc id="1244836" wikidata="Q1064530" url="?curid=1244836" title="Jingle All the Way">
<text>Jingle All the Way is a 1996 American Christmas family comedy film directed by Brian Levant. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sinbad as Howard Langston and Myron Larabee, two rival fathers living in Minneapolis desperately trying to purchase the popular Turbo Man action figure for their respective sons on a last-minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve. The film&#x27;s title is borrowed from the lyrics of the popular Christmas song &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;.

Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs for such items as Cabbage Patch Kids, the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas, and the project was picked up by 20th Century Fox. Delays to Fox&#x27;s reboot of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad instead of Joe Pesci as Myron. &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations, including the Mall of America. After five weeks of filming, production moved to California, where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film&#x27;s swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo Man action figure used in the film.

Upon release, &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; grossed $129.8 million worldwide but received generally negative reviews from critics, though the humor and Sinbad and Schwarzenegger&#x27;s performances received some praise. In 2001, Fox was ordered to pay $19 million to Murray Hill Publishing for stealing the idea for the film; the verdict was overturned three years later. &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; is the third and final collaboration between Sinbad and Phil Hartman after &quot;Coneheads&quot; (1993) and &quot;Houseguest&quot; (1995), and the last film featuring Hartman to be released during his lifetime before he was murdered in 1998. In 2014, the film was followed by a sequel in name only, &quot;Jingle All the Way 2&quot;, starring Larry the Cable Guy.

==Plot==
In Minneapolis, workaholic mattress salesman Howard Langston loves his wife, Liz, and nine-year-old son, Jamie, but rarely finds time for them. He is often put in a bad light by his neighbor, divorcé Ted Maltin, who harbors unrequited feelings for Liz. After missing Jamie&#x27;s karate class graduation due to being pulled over by Officer Hummel, Howard resolves to redeem himself by fulfilling his Christmas wish for a Turbo Man action figure based on the popular television superhero, despite Liz having asked him to buy the toy two weeks earlier, which Howard forgot about. On Christmas Eve, Howard sets out to buy the toy, but finds that every store has sold out, and in the process develops a rivalry with Myron Larabee, a postal worker father with the same goal.

In desperation, Howard attempts to buy a figure from a counterfeit ring run by con artists dressed in Santa suits, which results in a massive fight in the warehouse that is broken up by the police. Howard narrowly escapes arrest by posing as an undercover officer. Exhausted at his failure and out of fuel, Howard goes to Mickey&#x27;s Diner and calls home, intending to tell Liz the truth. Jamie answers the phone but keeps reminding him of his promise to be home on time for the annual Holiday Wintertainment Parade. Losing his patience, Howard yells at Jamie. When he tries to apologize, Jamie scolds him for not keeping his promises, causing Howard to feel guilty.

Howard finds Myron at the diner, where they overhear a radio station advertising a competition for a Turbo Man doll. The ensuing fight between them results in the diner&#x27;s phone getting disconnected, forcing them to race to the radio station on foot, where the DJ reveals that the competition was actually for a Turbo Man gift certificate. The police arrive, but Howard and Myron escape after Myron threatens the officers by pretending one of his packages is a bomb.

Upon returning home, Howard finds Ted putting the star on his family&#x27;s Christmas tree. In retaliation, Howard starts to steal the Turbo Man doll Ted bought for his son, Johnny, but can&#x27;t bring himself to do it. Unfortunately, Liz catches him in the act, and Howard is left alone while his family goes to the Christmas parade with Ted and Johnny.

After dropping off Jamie and Johnny, Ted attempts to seduce Liz, but she rejects him. Meanwhile, remembering his promise to Jamie to go to the parade, Howard decides to attend as well, but runs into Officer Hummell again. The resulting chase leads to Howard hiding inside a storage room, where he is mistaken for the actor portraying Turbo Man. As Turbo Man, Howard uses his chance to present the special edition action figure to Jamie, but they are confronted by Myron dressed as Turbo Man&#x27;s archenemy, Dementor.

Despite Howard&#x27;s pleas for Myron to stop, another chase ensues, during which Myron grabs the toy from Jamie but is cornered by the police, while Howard rescues Jamie. Howard reveals himself to his family and apologizes for his shortcomings. Officer Hummell returns the toy to Jamie, who decides to give the toy to Myron for his son. The entire parade then praises Howard as Jamie admits his performance as Turbo Man was the best present he could get.

In a post-credits scene, Howard realizes he forgot to buy a gift for his wife.

===Development===

The film draws inspiration from the high demand for Christmas toys such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which often led to intense searching and occasional violence among shoppers, such as the Cabbage Patch riots, over finding the toys. Randy Kornfield wrote the film&#x27;s original screenplay after witnessing his in-laws go to a Santa Monica toy store at dawn in order to get his son a Power Ranger. While admitting to missing the clamor for the Cabbage Patch Kids and Power Rangers, producer Chris Columbus experienced a similar situation in 1995 when he attempted to obtain a Buzz Lightyear action figure from the film &quot;Toy Story&quot;, released that year. As a result, he rewrote Kornfield&#x27;s script, which was accepted by 20th Century Fox. Columbus was always &quot;attracted to the dark side of the happiest holiday of the year&quot;, so wrote elements of the film as a satire of the commercialization of Christmas.

Brian Levant was hired to direct the film. Columbus said Levant &quot;underst[ood] the humor in the material&quot; and &quot;was very animated and excited, and he had a vision of what he wanted to do&quot;. Levant said &quot;The story that was important to me was between the father and son... It&#x27;s a story about love, and a father&#x27;s journey to deliver it in the form of a Turbo Man doll. The fact that I got to design a toy line and do the commercials and make pajamas and comic books was fun for me as a filmmaker. But at its root, the movie&#x27;s about something really sweet. It&#x27;s about love and building a better family. I think that&#x27;s consistent with everything I&#x27;ve done.&quot;

Arnold Schwarzenegger was quickly cast. He became available in February 1996 after Fox&#x27;s remake of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; was held up again; Columbus also exited that project to work on &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;. The film marks Schwarzenegger&#x27;s fourth appearance as the lead in a comedy film, following &quot;Twins&quot; (1988), &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; (1990) and &quot;Junior&quot; (1994). Schwarzenegger was paid a reported $20 million for the role. He enjoyed the film, having experienced last-minute Christmas shopping himself, and was attracted to playing an &quot;ordinary&quot; character in a family film. Columbus initially wanted Joe Pesci to play Myron. Comedian Sinbad was chosen instead, partly due to his similar height and size to Schwarzenegger. Sinbad was suggested for the part by Schwarzenegger&#x27;s agent, but the producers felt he was unsuited to the role of a villain as it could harm his clean, family-oriented comedy act and reputation, although Sinbad felt the character would generate the audience&#x27;s sympathy rather than hate. Furthermore, he missed the audition due to his appearance with First Lady Hillary Clinton and musician Sheryl Crow on the USO tour of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but Columbus waited for him to return to allow him to audition and, although Sinbad felt he had &quot;messed&quot; it up, he was given the part. He improvised the majority of his lines in the film; Schwarzenegger also improvised many of his responses in his conversations with Sinbad&#x27;s character.

===Filming===
Filming took place in Minnesota for five weeks from April 15, 1996; at the time, it was the largest film production to ever take place in the state. &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; was set and filmed in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota at locations such as Bloomington&#x27;s Mall of America, Mickey&#x27;s Diner, downtown Minneapolis, Linden Hills, residential areas of Edina and primarily downtown Saint Paul. Unused shops in the Seventh place Mall area were redecorated to resemble Christmas decorated stores, while the Energy Park Studios were used for much of the filming and the Christmas lights stayed up at Rice Park for use in the film. The Mall of America and the state&#x27;s &quot;semi-wintry weather&quot; proved attractive for the studio. Although Schwarzenegger stated that the locals were &quot;well-behaved&quot; and &quot;cooperative&quot;, Levant often found filming &quot;impossible&quot; due to the scale and noise of the crowds who came to watch production, especially in the Mall of America, but overall found the locals to be &quot;respectful&quot; and &quot;lovely people.&quot; Levant spent several months in the area before filming in order to prepare. The film uses artistic license by treating Minneapolis and Saint Paul as one city, as this was logistically easier; the police are labeled &quot;Twin Cities Police&quot; in the film. Additionally, the city&#x27;s Holidazzle Parade is renamed the Wintertainment Parade and takes place on 2nd Avenue during the day, rather than Nicollet Mall at night. Levant wanted to film the parade at night but was overruled for practical reasons.

The parade was filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood in California on the New York Street set, due to safety concerns. The set was designed to resemble 2nd Avenue; the parade was shot from above by helicopters and stitched into matte shots of the real-life street. It took three weeks to film, with 1,500 extras being used in the scene, along with three custom-designed floats. Other parts of the film to be shot in Los Angeles included store interiors, and the warehouse fight scene between Howard and the criminal Santas, for which a Pasadena furniture warehouse was used. Turbo Man was created and designed for the film. This meant the commercials and scenes from the &quot;Turbo Man&quot; TV series were all shot by Levant, while all of the Turbo Man merchandise, packaging and props in the film were custom-made one-offs and designed to look &quot;authentic, as if they all sprang from the same well.&quot; Along with Columbus and Levant, production designer Leslie McDonald and character designer Tim Flattery crafted Turbo Man, Booster and Dementor and helped make the full-size Turbo Man suit for the film&#x27;s climax. Principal production finished in August; Columbus &quot;fine-tun[ed] the picture until the last possible minute,&quot; using multiple test audiences &quot;to see where the big laughs actually lie.&quot;

==Music==
TVT Records released the film&#x27;s soundtrack album on Audio CD on November 26, 1996. It features only two of composer David Newman&#x27;s pieces from &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;, but features many of the songs by other artists included in the film, as well as other Christmas songs and new tracks by the Brian Setzer Orchestra. Intrada Music Group released a Special Collection limited edition of Newman&#x27;s full 23-track score on November 3, 2008.

==Release==
===Marketing===
As Schwarzenegger only signed on for the film in February and the film was shot so quickly, only six and a half months were available for merchandising, instead of the ideal year. As such, merchandising was limited to a 13.5-inch replica $25 Talking Turbo Man action figure and the West Coast exclusive Turbo Man Time Racer vehicle, while no tie-in promotions could be secured. Despite this, several critics wrote that the film was only being made to sell the toy. Columbus dismissed this notion, stating that with only roughly 200,000 Turbo Man toys being made, the merchandising was far less than the year&#x27;s other releases, such as &quot;Space Jam&quot; and &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;. The film&#x27;s release coincided with the Tickle Me Elmo craze, in which high demand for the doll during the 1996 Christmas season led to store mobbing similar to that depicted for Turbo Man.
The world premiere was held on November 16, 1996, at the Mall of America in Bloomington, where parts of the film were shot. A day of events was held to celebrate the film&#x27;s release, and Schwarzenegger donated memorabilia from the film to the Mall&#x27;s Planet Hollywood.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS on October 28, 1997, and in November 1998 it was released on DVD. It was re-released on DVD in December 2004, followed by an extended director&#x27;s cut in October 2007, known as the &quot;Family Fun Edition&quot;. It contained several minutes of extra footage, as well as other DVD extras such as a behind-the-scenes featurette. In December of the following year, the Family Fun Edition was released on Blu-ray Disc.

===Lawsuit===
In 1998, Murray Hill Publishing sued 20th Century Fox for $150,000, claiming that the idea for the film was stolen from a screenplay they had purchased from high school teacher Brian Webster entitled &quot;Could This Be Christmas?&quot; They said the script had 36 similarities with &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;, including the plot, dialogue and character names. Murray Hill President Bob Laurel bought the script from Webster in 1993, and sent it to Fox and other studios in 1994 but received no response and claimed the idea was copied by Kornfield, who was Fox&#x27;s script reader. In 2001, Fox were found liable of copyright infringement and ordered to pay $19 million ($15 million in damages and $4 million in legal costs) to Murray Hill, with Webster to receive a portion. Laurel died a few months after the verdict, before receiving any of the money. On appeal, the damages figure was lowered to $1.5 million, before the verdict itself was quashed in 2004 after a judge decided the idea was not stolen, as Fox had bought Kornfield&#x27;s screenplay before he or anybody else at Fox had read &quot;Could This Be Christmas?&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
Opening on November 22, &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; made $12.1 million in its first weekend, opening at #4 behind &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, &quot;Space Jam&quot; and &quot;Ransom&quot;; it went on to gross $129 million worldwide, recouping its $75 million budget in the first ten days of release. The film was released in the United Kingdom on December 6, 1996, and topped the country&#x27;s box office that weekend.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; holds an approval rating of 21% based on 47 reviews and an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger tries his best, but &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; suffers from an uneven tone, shifting wildly from a would-be satire on materialism to an antic, slapstick yuk-fest.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 34 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Emanuel Levy felt the film &quot;highly formulaic&quot; and criticized Levant&#x27;s direction as little more advanced than a television sitcom. Although he felt that the script did not provide sufficient opportunity for Hartman, Wilson and Conrad to give exceptional performances, he opined that &quot;Schwarzenegger has developed a light comic delivery, punctuated occasionally by an ironic one-liner,&quot; while &quot;Sinbad has good moments&quot;. Neil Jeffries of &quot;Empire&quot; disagreed, feeling Schwarzenegger to be &quot;wooden&quot; and Sinbad to be &quot;trying desperately to be funnier than his hat&quot; but praised Lloyd as the &quot;saving grace&quot; of the film.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Janet Maslin felt the film lacked any real plot, failed in its attempt at satire, should have included Myron&#x27;s only mentioned son and &quot;mostly wasted&quot; Hartman, while Levant&#x27;s direction was &quot;listless&quot;. Similarly, the BBC&#x27;s Neil Smith criticized the film&#x27;s script, its focus on the commercialization of Christmas, as well as Schwarzenegger&#x27;s performance which shows &quot;the comic timing of a dead moose,&quot; but singled out Hartman for praise. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Michael Wilmington panned the film, wondering why the characters (primarily Howard) acted so illogically: &quot;Howard Langston is supposed to be a successful mattress manufacturer, but the movie paints him as a hot-tempered buffoon without a sensible idea in his head.&quot; Jack Garner of &quot;USA Today&quot; condemned the film, finding it more &quot;cynical&quot; than satirical, stating &quot;this painfully bad movie has been inspired strictly by the potential jingle of cash registers.&quot; He wrote of Levant&#x27;s directorial failure as he &quot;offers no ... sense of comic timing,&quot; while &quot;pauses in the midst of much of the dialogue are downright painful.&quot; Trevor Johnston suggested that the film &quot;seems to mark a point of decline in the Schwarzenegger career arc&quot; and the anti-consumerism message largely failed, with &quot;Jim Belushi&#x27;s corrupt mall Santa with his stolen-goods warehouse ... provid[ing] the film&#x27;s sole flash of dark humour.&quot;

IGN&#x27;s Mike Drucker praised its subject matter as &quot;one of the few holiday movies to directly deal with the commercialization of Christmas&quot; although felt the last twenty minutes of the film let it down, as the first hour or so had &quot;some family entertainment&quot; value if taken with a &quot;grain of salt&quot;. He concluded the film was &quot;a member of the so-corny-its-good genre,&quot; while &quot;Arnold delivers plenty of one-liners ripe for sound board crank callers.&quot; Jamie Malanowski of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film&#x27;s satirical premise but felt it was &quot;full of unrealized potential&quot; because &quot;the filmmakers [wrongly] equate mayhem with humor.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that he &quot;liked a lot of the movie&quot;, which he thought had &quot;energy&quot; and humor which would have mass audience appeal. He was, though, disappointed by &quot;its relentlessly materialistic view of Christmas, and by the choice to go with action and (mild) violence over dialogue and plot.&quot; Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures concluded that while the film is not very good, as a form of family entertainment it is &quot;surprisingly fun.&quot;

===Accolades===

==Sequel==

Over 18 years after the release of the original film, a stand-alone sequel, &quot;Jingle All the Way 2&quot;, was released straight-to-DVD in December 2014. Directed by Alex Zamm and produced by WWE Studios and 20th Century Fox, the film has a similar plot to the original, but is otherwise not connected and has none of the original cast or characters. The lead roles were instead played by Larry the Cable Guy and Santino Marella.

<text>Artavazd Peleshyan (; also &quot;Pelechian, Peleshian&quot;; born February 22, 1938) is an Armenian director of essay films, a documentarian in the history of film art, a screenwriter, and a film theorist. He is renowned for developing a style of cinematographic perspective known as distance montage, combining perception of depth with oncoming entities, such as running packs of antelope or hordes of humans. Filmmaker Sergei Parajanov has referred to Peleshyan as &quot;one of the few authentic geniuses in the world of cinema&quot;. Peleshyan was awarded the title of Merited Artist of the Armenian SSR in 1979, and Merited Artist of the Russian Federation in 1995.

His films have been described as being on the border between a documentary and a feature film, somewhat reminiscent of the work of such avant-garde filmmakers as Bruce Conner, rather than of conventional documentaries. However, it has been noted that his work, unlike Maya Deren&#x27;s, is not firmly within the avant-garde, and that it does not try to explore the absurd. Peleshyan&#x27;s films have been summarized as &quot;a poetic view of life transferred onto film.&quot;

He has made extensive use of archive footage and for the first time used only original footage in his most celebrated film, &quot;Seasons of the Year&quot;, shot by cinematographer Mikhail Vartanov. Telephoto lenses are often used to get &quot;candid camera&quot; shots of people engaging in mundane tasks.

Most of Peleshyan&#x27;s films are short, ranging from 6 to about 60 minutes long, and feature no dialogue. However, music and sound effects play nearly as important a role in his films as the visual images in contributing towards the artistic whole. Nearly all of his films were shot in black-and-white.

==Works==

Peleshyan&#x27;s early films, made when he was still a student at VGIK, were awarded several prizes. Twelve films by Peleshyan are known to exist. &quot;The Beginning&quot; ( &quot;Skizbe&quot;) (1967) is a cinematographical essay about the October Revolution of 1917. One of the unique visual effects used in this film is achieved by holding snippets of film still on a single frame, then advancing only for a second or two before again pausing on another, resulting in a stuttering visual effect. 

Other important films by him are &quot;We&quot; ( &quot;Menq&quot;) (1967), a poetically told history of Armenia and its people, and &quot;Inhabitants&quot; ( &quot;Obitateli&quot;) (1970), a reflection on the relationship between wildlife and humans. 

Artavazd Peleshian&#x27;s most significant film is considered, by many critics, to be &quot;Seasons of the Year&quot; ( &quot;Tarva yeghanaknere&quot;) (1975), shot by cinematographer Mikhail Vartanov. It is a look at the contradiction and harmony between humans and nature and was the last collaboration between Peleshian and Vartanov, Armenia&#x27;s two most important documentary auteurs, who first worked together on &quot;The Autumn Pastoral&quot; ( &quot;Ashnanayin hovvergutyun&quot;) (1971).

Peleshyan is also the author of a range of theoretical works, such as his 1988 book, &quot;My Cinema&quot; ( &quot;Moyo kino&quot;).

Being from a country removed from internationally significant cinema circles, Peleshyan&#x27;s efforts were not initially well-recognized by critics of world cinema. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, he has made two more short films, &quot;Life&quot; ( &quot;Kyanq&quot;) (1993) and &quot;The End&quot; (1994). He is now living in Moscow. His most recent film, &quot;Nature&quot; (), was edited at the ZKM | Karlsruhe Film Institute in 2005-2006 and was premiered in 2020.

==Personal commentary==

In 1998, Peleshyan reflected on his approach to filmmaking and cinematography,

&quot;It&#x27;s about what I&#x27;m striving for, what we&#x27;re all striving for - every person, humanity [...] the wishes and desires of the people to ascend, to transcend [...] I was thinking of everything. It&#x27;s not specifically the seasons of the year or of people: it&#x27;s everything [...] Eisenstein&#x27;s montage was linear, like a chain. Distance montage creates a magnetic field around the film [...] Sometimes I don&#x27;t call my method &#x27;montage&#x27;. I&#x27;m involved in a process of creating unity. In a sense I&#x27;ve eliminated montage: by creating the film through montage, I have destroyed montage. In the totality, in the wholeness of one of my films, there is no montage, no collision, so as a result montage has been destroyed. In Eisenstein every element means something. For me the individual fragments don&#x27;t mean anything anymore. Only the whole film has the meaning [...] For me, distance montage opens up the mysteries of the movement of the universe. I can feel how everything is made and put together; I can sense its rhythmic movement.&quot;

Melançon was born in Napoleonville, Louisiana, the son of Nicee L. &quot;Brownie&quot; (née Talbot) and Joe Melançon. The grandson and great-grandson of sugar cane farmers, Melançon has spent most of his life in Napoleonville, 50 miles south of Baton Rouge. He owned and operated several small businesses, including two Baskin-Robbins outlets. He also served as head of the American Sugar Cane League.

==Louisiana House of Representatives==

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Melançon ran in 2004 for the House of Representatives seat in Louisiana&#x27;s 3rd congressional district and won.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Energy and Commerce
**Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet
**Subcommittee on Energy and Environment

Very soon after being sworn in January 2005, Melançon joined the Blue Dog Coalition. Like most Southern Democrats, he is more conservative than most members of the national party, especially on social issues. But he did vote for the DREAM Act and repealing &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot;.

===Hurricanes Katrina and Rita===
Just a few months after Melancon took office, Hurricane Katrina slammed into south Louisiana, causing massive levee failures and devastating flooding in the eastern part of his district. A second major storm, Hurricane Rita, struck the Gulf Coast three weeks later. Melancon worked with the rest of the Louisiana delegation in Congress to bring billions of recovery dollars to south Louisiana. He fought for federal funding for hurricane protection projects such as Morganza-to-the-Gulf and the levee systems in lower Plaquemines Parish and south Lafourche Parish.

Melancon has continuously urged other members of the United States Congress to visit south Louisiana for as long as Louisiana still has recovery or hurricane protection needs. He has brought Congressional delegations to the Gulf Coast to see firsthand the destruction from the storms as well as the ongoing need for hurricane protection and coastal restoration. Since the storms, Melancon has sponsored a number of reform bills to try to fix the flaws in the government&#x27;s disaster response and relief system. As the representative for much of south Louisiana, Melançon has been an advocate in the United States Congress for hurricane recovery.

===Supporting small businesses and economic development===
Melancon supported the Job Creation Through Entrepreneurship Act (H.R. 2352), a bill that provided funding for more small business development centers. These small business incubators provide office space, support, and technology to help new companies get off the ground. He also supported tax relief for small businesses, voting for the Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2007 (H.R. 976). The bill provided tax credits and incentives for expanding and purchasing new equipment. Melançon joined other members from energy-producing states, as well as the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, to keep new taxes on the oil and gas industry out of the President&#x27;s 2010 budget.

===Climate change===
Melancon voted against the American Clean Energy and Security Act (H.R. 2454) twice, once in the Energy and Commerce Committee and again in the full the United States House of Representatives. The bill is also known as the &quot;Waxman-Markey Energy Bill&quot; or the &quot;cap-and-trade&quot; bill. Melançon said in a release that he opposed the bill because he believed it would hurt his &quot;district and the people I represent … The oil and gas industry is the engine driving south Louisiana&#x27;s economy, providing good-paying jobs to hundreds of thousands of our workers for generations.&quot;

Melancon was successful in including an amendment in the bill that would protect Louisiana&#x27;s share of wetlands restoration funding from cuts indirectly caused by hurricane disaster assistance.

===America&#x27;s Affordable Health Choices Act===
On July 31, 2009, Melançon voted against the America&#x27;s Affordable Health Choices Act (H.R. 3200) in the Energy and Commerce Committee. Melançon explained in a statement that he voted against the bill for reasons including its potential effects on small businesses, the possibility of taxpayer-funded abortions, and increases in taxes.

Melançon said he was concerned that &quot;the public option, as designed, would unfairly undercut anything the private sector could offer.&quot; He noted that the bill does not do enough to address the need for more providers in rural communities.

Melancon also voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010, because it &quot;doesn’t work for Louisiana.&quot; However, he had not signed the discharge petition circulated by Iowa Republican Steve King calling for a complete repeal of the law.

===American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009===
Melançon voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In explaining his vote for the legislation, Melançon said, &quot;The people of south Louisiana sent me to Congress because I promised to listen to them and do what I thought was right, not what was most popular or what my party told me to do. This plan, while far from perfect, will create or save an estimated 50,000 jobs in Louisiana, invest over $538 million in infrastructure projects for our state, and lay a foundation for long-term growth for our country through innovation and education.&quot;

===Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008===
Melancon voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

===Employee Free Choice Act===
Although Melancon is listed as a co-sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act, his comments on the bill indicate a more ambivalent measure of support. He has stated, &quot;I understand many of the concerns expressed by the business community. I am interested in bringing both sides together to work out their differences and develop a bipartisan solution that will address some of these concerns, while still protecting employees’ rights.&quot;

===Federal Marriage Amendment===
In July 2006, Rep. Melancon voted in support of the Federal Marriage Amendment.

===Matthew Shepard Act of 2009===
On 29 April 2009, Rep. Melancon voted against the federal hate crimes expansion bill known as the Matthew Shepard Act.

==Political campaigns==

===2004 U.S. House campaign===
Melancon declared his candidacy for Congress after longtime incumbent Billy Tauzin announced his retirement. Although he was considered an underdog for much of the race, he entered a runoff due to an especially ugly intraparty battle between Republican candidates Billy Tauzin III and state Senator Craig Romero, the former candidate being the son of the incumbent. In the runoff campaign, Melançon repeatedly hammered away at Tauzin III&#x27;s family ties. Melançon won a victory by 569 votes. Romero set his sights on challenging Melançon in 2006, and was defeated again.

===2006 U.S. House campaign===

On November 7, 2006, Melancon defeated Romero 55% to 40% to win a second term in the U.S. House.

===2008 U.S. House campaign===

He was re-elected without opposition in November 2008. Because of William J. Jefferson&#x27;s defeat on December 6 after federal corruption indictments, Melancon became the sole Democrat representing Louisiana in the U.S. House.

===2010 U.S. Senate campaign===
Melançon challenged incumbent Republican U.S. Senator David Vitter in 2010. In announcing his candidacy on August 27, 2009, he billed himself as &quot;a proud centrist&quot; and &quot;a straight up the middle fighter for the little guy.&quot;

==Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries==
Edwards announced that state Representative Jack Montoucet of Scott in Lafayette Parish would take office in January 2017 to succeed Melancon as the wildlife and fisheries secretary.

==Personal life==
Melançon is married to the former Peachy Clark; they have two children.

<doc id="1244864" wikidata="Q7733450" url="?curid=1244864" title="The Farmer's Bride">
<text>The Farmer&#x27;s Bride is a poetry collection by Charlotte Mew, first published in 1916 under the imprint of Harold Monro&#x27;s Poetry Bookshop. An expanded collection of the same name, with eleven additional poems, appeared in 1921. This was published in the US under the title &quot;Saturday Market&quot;. 

The title poem in the collection, &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Bride&quot;, had initially appeared in &quot;The Nation&quot; in 1912. The poem is a poignant lament by an inarticulate farmer about his love for his young wife and her inability to respond to him either physically or emotionally.

== The Farmer&#x27;s Bride ==
&lt;poem&gt;
Three Summers since I chose a maid,
Too young maybe – but more&#x27;s to do
At harvest-time than bide and woo.
 When us was wed she turned afraid
Of love and me and all things human;
Like the shut of a winter&#x27;s day
Her smile went out, and &#x27;twasn&#x27;t a woman –
 More like a little frightened fay.
 One night, in the Fall, she runned away.

&#x27;Out &#x27;mong the sheep, her be,&#x27; they said,
Should properly have been abed;
But sure enough she wasn&#x27;t there
Lying awake with her wide brown stare.
 So over seven-acre field and up-along across the down
We chased her, flying like a hare
Before our lanterns. To Church-Town
 All in a shiver and a scare
We caught her, fetched her home at last
 And turned the key upon her, fast.

She does the work about the house
As well as most, but like the mouse:
 Happy enough to chat and play
 With birds and rabbits as such as they,
 So long as men-folk keep away.
&#x27;Not near, not near!&#x27; her eyes beseech
When one of us comes within reach.
 The women say that beasts in stall
 Look round like children at her call
 I&#x27;ve hardly heard her speak at all

Shy as a leveret, swift as he,
Straight and slight as a young larch tree,
Sweet as the first wild violets, she,
To her wild self. But what to me?

The short days shorten and the oaks are brown,
 The blue smoke rises to the low grey sky,
One leaf in the still air falls slowly down,
 A magpie&#x27;s spotted feathers lie
On the black earth spread white with rime,
The berries redden up to Christmas-time.
 What&#x27;s Christmas-time without there be
 Some other in the house than we!

She sleeps up in the attic there
 Alone, poor maid. &#x27;Tis but a stair
Betwixt us. Oh! my God! the down,
The soft young down of her; the brown,
The brown of her – her eyes, her hair, her hair! &lt;/poem&gt;

==Analysis==
&quot;The Farmer’s Bride&quot; was a groundbreaking piece of work that shed light on Charlotte Mew&#x27;s literary expertise and unique style of writing. Mew&#x27;s life, which she kept very private, was full of tumultuous sorrow, loss, and upheaval from a very young age. As the oldest daughter of seven children she watched as several of her siblings were institutionalized, suffered from mental illness, and eventually committed suicide.

<text>Mustafa Suphi or Mustafa Subhi (1883 – 28 January 1921) was a Turkish revolutionary and communist during the period of dissolution of the Ottoman Empire.

== Early life ==
Suphi was born in 1883 in Giresun Province, in the Ottoman Empire, now located in Turkey. He was educated in Jerusalem, Damascus and Erzurum before he attended Galatasaray High School. He studied political science in Paris, where he was also a correspondent of the Turkish newspaper &quot;Tanin&quot;. He returned to Turkey in 1910, where he edited the newspaper &quot;Ifham&quot;. He also gave lectures on law and economics. In 1913 he was accused of involvement in the assassination of Mahmud Şevket Pasha and sentenced to fifteen years of exile in Sinop. There, he contributed articles about western philosophy to the periodicals &quot;Ictiha&quot; and &quot;Hak&quot;. However, in 1914 he escaped from Sinop and fled to Russia, where, following the outbreak of the First World War, Russian authorities regarded him as a prisoner of war and sent him into exile in the Ural region.

==Communist activism==
In 1915, he was in the Urals, where he joined the Bolshevik Party. In July 1918, he helped organise the Congress of the Turkish Left Socialists, held in Moscow, and in November, he became involved in Muskom. He was also elected to the &quot;Central Committee of the All Russia Muslim Workers&quot; section of Narkomnats. He acted as Mirsäyet Soltanğäliev&#x27;s secretary. In 1918 he founded &quot;Yeni Dünya&quot; (New World) in Moscow and used it to popularise the foundations of scientific socialism to Turkish prisoners-of-war. He was chairperson of the Turkish Section of Eastern Publicity Bureau, and in 1919 attended the First Congress of the Third International as the delegate for Turkey.

At the First Congress of Communist Party of Turkey, held in Baku on 10 September 1920, Suphi was elected its chairman and went to Anatolia. He was one of the 15 communists who went to Turkey to join the Turkish War of Independence. After encountering hostility in Erzurum, the communists tried to return to Baku. However, they were murdered by Sailor Yahya after they had set sail from Trabzon on the night of 28 January 1921. He was possibly murdered by a group of supporters of Enver Pasha from Trabzon, apparently because of the fear that Suphi might expose Enver Pasha&#x27;s plans of political activities in Moscow and his ultimate intention of using the Bolsheviks to regain power in Turkey once the Turkish National Movement were defeated.

:&quot;There is need to provide army service area in order to establish links between the partisan troops in various locations of Anatolia and there is need to establish Military-Revolution Committee so as to strengthen this movement. This organization is going to be independent; but our organization will guide it. All the mission of Military-Revolution Committee of Turkey will concentrate on the direction of progression and preservation of the movement of social revolution both in Soviet Russia and worldwide. It will prove useful for Anatolian movement against English – French occupiers, for the spread of this movement throughout the Caucasus and for the organization of Soviet power in those places. Military-Revolution Committee of Turkey taking control of all the duties in Anatolia by means of making use of the first opportunity, will build Socialist Turkey and run towards the aim of joining hands with neighbour Soviet Russia.&quot; (M. Suphi; Moscow, 28 October 1919)

==Death==
Suphi was killed by Sailor Yahya together with his communist comrades while traveling to Batumi in the Black Sea on 28 January 1921.

<text>Rowland Kelechukwu &quot;Kele&quot; Okereke (born 13 October 1981), also known mononymously as Kele, is an English singer, songwriter, and musician. He is best known as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of the indie rock band Bloc Party. Additionally, he has released six studio albums as a solo artist.

==Early life==
Okereke was born in Liverpool on 13 October 1981, the son of Nigerian immigrant parents. He is of Igbo descent and was raised Catholic in Edinburgh and London. In his teenage years in London, he attended Trinity Catholic High School, Woodford Green. From 2001 to 2003, he studied English literature at King&#x27;s College London.

==Music career==
===Bloc Party===

Okereke knew fellow East London guitarist Russell Lissack through friends, and the pair established Bloc Party in 1999 at the Reading Festival. Bass player Gordon Moakes answered an advertisement placed in the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; in 2000, and in 2003 Matt Tong became the band&#x27;s drummer after eight others had held the role. Okereke did not reveal to his parents that he was a musician until Bloc Party were signed; he then quit university.

Bloc Party&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Silent Alarm&quot;, charted at number 3 on the UK Album Charts, and its fast pace was likened to post-punk band Gang of Four, a band that Okereke said he had never heard of. Okereke reflected in 2007 that the album&#x27;s lyrics were too abstract, and that he had been inspired by the Smiths to write more direct lyrics.

The band released their second album &quot;A Weekend in the City&quot; in February 2007, peaking at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States and No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart. For the album, Okereke chose more personal and political subjects for songs. A family friend, Christopher Alaneme, had been murdered in a racist attack, while London bartender David Morley was beaten to death in a possibly homophobic &quot;happy slapping&quot; incident. Okereke said that these events, combined with the 7 July London bombings, &quot;galvanised [his] mindset&quot; and prompted him to make the lyrics &quot;dark, bigger and quite abrasive&quot;. The song &quot;SRXT&quot; was named after the antidepressant seroxat and inspired by two of Okereke&#x27;s university friends attempting suicide. The first single, &quot;The Prayer&quot;, reached No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart, still the group&#x27;s highest placing. The next single, &quot;I Still Remember,&quot; was the album&#x27;s first in the US. The album was produced by Jacknife Lee.

Okereke responded critically to comments made by Liam and Noel Gallagher of Oasis in early 2007. Liam called Bloc Party &quot;a band off of &quot;University Challenge&quot;&quot; while Noel dismissed them as &quot;indie shit&quot;. Okereke replied by calling Oasis &quot;the most overrated and pernicious band of all time&quot; and that &quot;They have made stupidity hip&quot;. He opined that despite Oasis&#x27; love of the Beatles, they did not evolve like their heroes and were &quot;repetitive Luddites&quot;. When Oasis cancelled their headlining set at the Rock en Seine festival in August 2009 and eventually broke up, Okereke broke the news to the crowd and referred to the Gallaghers as &quot;those inbred twins&quot;.

The third album released by the band &quot;Intimacy&quot;, was initially only made available for purchase on their website as a download on 21 August 2008. The record was released in compact disc form on 24 October 2008, with Wichita Recordings as the primary label. It peaked at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart and entered the Billboard 200 in the United States at number 18.

Okereke made a guest appearance on Tiësto&#x27;s song &quot;It&#x27;s Not the Things You Say&quot; on his album &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, released 6 October 2009 and also Martin Solveig&#x27;s &#x27;Ready 2 Go&#x27;, after which Bloc Party went on hiatus.

In 2011, Kele reunited with Bloc Party to record the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Four&quot;, which was released in August 2012. The album peaked in the UK charts at number three.

In 2013, the band released an EP called &quot;The Nextwave Sessions&quot; and went on an indefinite hiatus.

Bloc Party reunited in 2015 with a new line-up. They released their fifth album &quot;Hymns&quot; on 29 January 2016.

===Solo career===

Okereke released his first solo album, titled &quot;The Boxer&quot;, produced by XXXChange, on 21 June 2010, through Wichita / Polydor in the UK and Europe and Glassnote Records for the rest of the world. The album was released under the name Kele, dropping his surname. Okereke explained the album title, saying &quot;as a boxer, you have to rely on nobody else but yourself to achieve what it is you want to achieve. Even though you take hits, you have to keep focus on your priorities and keep going. I thought that was an inspiring image.&quot; The first single from the album, &quot;Tenderoni&quot;, was released on 14 June 2010.

On 13 September 2011, &quot;NME&quot; and Wichita Recordings announced that Kele would be releasing a follow-up to &quot;The Boxer&quot;; an EP titled &quot;The Hunter&quot;.

Kele released the single &quot;Everything You Wanted&quot;. It was remixed by South African producers DJ Qness and DJ Mujava, who brought in a fusion of pop along with their traditional South African Kwaito music.

Kele features on Sub Focus&#x27; single &quot;Turn It Around&quot; from his second studio album &quot;Torus&quot;. The song was released on 22 September 2013.

On 23 July 2014, Kele announced his second solo album, entitled &quot;Trick&quot;, to be released on his own label Lilac Records via Kobalt Label Services on 13 October 2014.

Okereke released his third album &quot;Fatherland&quot; on 6 October 2017 under his full name (whereas his first two albums were released under the mononym &#x27;Kele&#x27;). Two tracks, &quot;Yemaya&quot; and &quot;Streets Been Talkin&#x27;&quot;, have been released from the album as of July 2017.

On 19 March 2018, the Bloc Party Facebook page put a picture up indicating they were doing a tour of six shows in Europe performing songs from their first album, Silent Alarm.

In January 2019, &quot;Leave to Remain&quot;, a new musical written by Okereke and Matt Jones debuted in London. Announced in September 2018, the musical about an interracial gay couple was preceded by the single &quot;Not the Drugs Talking&quot; which showed a move back towards beats following the more acoustic &quot;Fatherland&quot;. Telling a love story through the Prism of Brexit, the new show is accompanied by a tie-in album of new songs. Speaking about the subject matter and his feelings on the UK in 2019, Okereke claimed that &quot;It&#x27;s not a time that I&#x27;ve been proud to be British. It&#x27;s an ugly time. The opportunity to tell a story about people from different cultures coming together and finding love in the shadow of that is an important thing to stand up for.&quot;

In November 2019, saw the release of Kele&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;2042&quot;. The title is a reference to the year that census data predicts ethnic minorities will become the majority in the United States. Much of the album tackles political themes such as the Windrush scandal, Grenfell Tower fire and Colin Kaepernick&#x27;s national anthem protest. Musically, Kele fuses funk with experimental electro, glitchy guitars and West African beats, according to NME. The album was released under the name Kele, again dropping his surname.

In May 2021, Okereke released his fifth studio album entitled &quot;The Waves Pt. 1&quot;. In March 2023, Okereke released his sixth studio album following on from &quot;The Waves&quot; entitled &quot;The Flames Pt. 2&quot;.

==Personal life==
In the early years of Bloc Party&#x27;s fame, Okereke was often uncomfortable with media interviews that focused on his position as a black man in British rock music, and speculation about his sexuality when he was still closeted. Okereke wrote in 2011 that he felt a subtext in interviews mentioning his race, namely that he was being told that British rock music was not for black people. In 2007, Okereke contrasted his introverted personality with the more stereotypical rock singer bravado of his contemporaries Tom Meighan of Kasabian and Johnny Borrell of Razorlight, saying &quot;they&#x27;re gonna be a footnote in history in 10 years&#x27; time. There&#x27;s no battle in them. There&#x27;s no conflict&quot;.

In October 2008, Okereke moved to Berlin to seize the city&#x27;s music oriented spirit. He then moved to New York City until 2011, and said that the experience made him &quot;radicalised as a black man&quot; as he noted segregation in the United States; he said that the situation was better in the UK as his music was appreciated by largely white audiences.

In March 2010, Okereke came out as gay in a &quot;BUTT&quot; magazine article. He then gave an interview and appeared on the June 2010 cover of &quot;Attitude&quot; magazine. He had previously been reluctant to discuss his sexuality, though he had compared himself to bisexual musicians Brian Molko and David Bowie. Additionally, he has discussed the homoerotic story behind the Bloc Party song &quot;I Still Remember&quot; and its semi-autobiographical nature. In June 2010, he was named as the &quot;Sexiest Out Gay Male Artist&quot; by music website &quot;LP33&quot; in its annual survey.

In 2010, Okereke launched his personal website at iamkele.com.

In 2017, Okereke and his boyfriend of seven years became the father of a daughter via surrogacy in the United States. Around the same time, he left Shoreditch in East London for a new home south of the Thames, as &quot;I was fed up with the grey and people vomiting in the streets. I wanted some green and some anonymity, to insulate myself from that world&quot;.

Okereke endorsed Labour&#x27;s Jeremy Corbyn in a 2017 webchat with &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 2022, Okereke gave his opinion that apart from some artists such as Slowthai, Idles and Billy Bragg, few were standing up to racism in the United Kingdom. When Brandon Flowers of the Killers praised Morrissey&#x27;s music after being about the latter singer&#x27;s racially charged comments, Okereke responded by saying &quot;It does matter. It absolutely matters what people say and the fact that no one is willing to challenge [Flowers] on this to me is quite disgusting. Shame on [Flowers] and shame on Morrissey&quot;.

<text>Gordon Peter Moakes (born 22 June 1976) is an English musician, best known as the bassist of rock band Young Legionnaire and former member of indie rock band Bloc Party.

==Bloc Party==
Moakes became a member of Bloc Party after responding to an advertisement placed in the &quot;NME&quot; music magazine by Kele Okereke and Russell Lissack, who were seeking a bassist. Although not originally a bassist, Moakes was the only player the band auditioned who was able to play the bassline for a song that Okereke and Lissack had presented. In 2002, Moakes, Lissack, and Okereke formed the first incarnation of Bloc Party – then known as The Angel Range – and played shows across London. Moakes also ran and updated the band&#x27;s website at the time.

Moakes shared co-writing credits with Okereke on some of the band&#x27;s earlier lyrics. In the early days of the band, he contributed lyrics mostly to the band&#x27;s more political songs, and he composed the song &quot;Diet&quot;. Moakes added new instruments to his repertoire on Bloc Party&#x27;s second and third albums, &quot;A Weekend in the City&quot; and &quot;Intimacy&quot; respectively. He played drums on &quot;Sunday&quot;, electronic drums on &quot;Ares&quot;, glockenspiel on &quot;Waiting for the 7.18&quot; and &quot;SRXT&quot; and a microKORG synthesizer on &quot;Flux&quot;. His voice can be heard in many of the band&#x27;s songs, often in contrast with Okereke&#x27;s lead vocals.

Moakes remixed the band&#x27;s song &quot;Talons&quot; from their album &quot;Intimacy&quot;. It was featured as a part of the single download as well as appearing as the B-side to its vinyl release.

In 2015, confirmed that he had left the band to focus on Young Legionnaire. He was replaced by Justin Harris later in the year. Moakes resided in Austin, Texas for several years but currently resides in London, England with his wife and children.

==Other works==
Moakes worked with on the track &quot;Wait a Minute&quot; from the album &quot;Print Is Dead Vol 1&quot;. &quot;Wait a Minute&quot; was released on a limited edition 7&quot; single on 4 October 2006. Moakes designed the cover art.

In December 2009, Moakes, Paul Mullen (vocalist and guitarist of The Automatic) and William Bowerman (drummer of La Roux) worked in the studio together on a new side project, with Bloc Party on hiatus and both The Automatic and La Roux inactive over the Christmas break. In January 2010, the group were revealed to be named Young Legionnaire and were set to play their first show at the end of January in London.

In February 2024, Moakes performed a series of gigs with The None, his new band. The band was born out of Moakes’ desire “to start something new” after relocatiing from Austin, Texas back to London.

<doc id="1244879" wikidata="Q262203" url="?curid=1244879" title="Fatih Terim">
<text>Fatih Terim (born 4 September 1953) is a Turkish professional football manager and former player. He is the manager of Saudi Pro League club Al-Shabab.

During his football career, he played for Ceyhanspor, Adana Demirspor and Galatasaray. In his eleven years of playing time for Galatasaray, he won the Prime Minister&#x27;s Cup in 1975 and in 1979, the Turkish Cup in 1975–76, 1981–82 and 1984–85 seasons and the Turkish Super Cup in 1982 with the club. Terim has managed several clubs in Italy (Milan and Fiorentina) and Turkey, as well as the Turkey national team, most recently from 2013 to 2017.

In a survey conducted by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS) in 80 countries, he was placed among the best eight managers in the world, receiving his award at a ceremony held in Rothenburg, Germany, on 8 January 2001. On 25 April 2007, Terim received the order of &quot;Commendatore&quot; awarded by the Italian state. In 2008, he received a nomination for UEFA manager of the year and Eurosport named him the best coach at UEFA Euro 2008. In December 2008, he was ranked the seventh-best football manager in the world by &quot;World Soccer&quot; magazine in 2008. His Turkish nickname is &quot;&quot;İmparator&quot;, and his Italian nickname is &quot;Imperatore&quot;&quot;. Both names mean &quot;emperor&quot;.

== Club career ==

In 1969, Terim began his professional football career with Adana Demirspor. Because of his financial difficulties, he was the only player in the team who was being paid secretly by the club at the time. He became the team captain three years later. He attracted attention with the game he displayed in Adana Demirspor, who became the champions of the 2nd League in the 1972–73 season. Terim played for Adana Demirspor until 1974, when he joined Galatasaray as a sweeper on 8 July 1974. Terim played eleven years for the Istanbul club. During that time, the club never won the Turkish league championship trophy.

He played for the Turkey national team 51 times between 1974 and 1985 and was the national team captain for 35 international matches, setting the national record in both categories at that time. In 1985, he had a fight with referee Hamza Alan for showing a red card to his teammate in a match and Terim was also shown a red card. It is alleged that Terim refused to leave the field, provoked the tribunes and was removed from the field by police forces. He decided to quit football after receiving a five-match penalty.

Terim&#x27;s jubilee was held at Ali Sami Yen Stadium. He showed up to his jubilee match, which was between Trabzonspor and Galatasaray, by landing on the pitch by helicopter while the game was being played.

During his time as a footballer, he drew attention with his undisciplined behaviour and was frequently fined. Abdullah Gegiç, a famous football coach with Partizan in the former Yugoslavia and Eskişehirspor in Turkey, knew Terim from his days as a central defender and described him as an intelligent defender with &quot;Beckenbauer-like&quot; qualities. Gegiç attributed Terim&#x27;s successes as a coach to the unique understanding of the game that he developed while playing as a central defender.

== Managerial career ==
=== Early years ===
After retiring from professional football, his first training appointment came from Jupp Derwall while they were both at Galatasaray. Terim&#x27;s coaching career began when he was appointed the coach of Ankaragücü. He coached the club for 18 months before moving on to coach Göztepe in İzmir for a year. He had no significant success with either team. He was appointed as assistant to Turkey&#x27;s national coach, Sepp Piontek, in 1990. He also coached the Turkey under-21 team. After serving as assistant coach for three years, he was appointed coach in 1993. Under his management, Turkey qualified for the final tournament of European Football Championship in 1996, for the first time in its history. Although they did not perform well in the tournament, losing all their matches and not scoring any goals, qualification was still considered a great achievement for Turkish football.

==== Galatasaray (first term) ====
After Euro 1996, Terim signed a contract with Galatasaray. The club had invested in strong (international) players such as Gica Hagi, Gica Popescu, Taffarel and Ilie as well as high-potential (academy) players such as Emre. Under his management Galatasaray won the Turkish league championship for four consecutive years and the UEFA Cup in 2000, making Terim the most successful Galatasaray manager in its history. His departure allowed Mircea Lucescu to clinch the UEFA Super Cup in 2000 for Galatasaray.

=== Fiorentina ===
Terim moved from Galatasaray to the Italian Serie A, signing a one-year contract with Fiorentina. His aggressive style of football and his tense relationship with club president and owner Vittorio Cecchi Gori made Terim popular among Fiorentina fans. With new boys Brazilian Leandro Amaral and Portugal&#x27;s Nuno Gomes doing well up front, with a steadier defence and with Portuguese playmaker Rui Costa blossoming under Terim&#x27;s constant praise and encouragement Fiorentina became a strong team in Italy. The league wins against Milan (4–0), Internazionale, Udinese and holding Juventus to a 3–3 draw came in a fortnight when the Florence club cruised into the final of the Coppa Italia eliminating Milan 4–2 on aggregate. Despite his poor start in the UEFA Cup (eliminated 5-3 on agg. by Tirol Innsbruck in the first round), Terim had managed to communicate something of himself to both his players and to the club&#x27;s demanding fans. Even as Cecchi Gori was beginning to count the cost of sacking him, the fans made it clear that they were on the side of Terim.

However, later he announced that he would not renew his contract by the end of the season, because Cecchi Gori did not intend to make the investments that he requested. The team&#x27;s performance declined significantly from then on because of his continuing clashes with Cecchi Gori led Terim to resign on 26 February 2001, before the season ended. Fiorentina director general Giancarlo Antognoni, one of the greatest players in the club&#x27;s history, also resigned along with Terim&#x27;s entire coaching staff, despite the fact that Cecchi Gori had begged him to stay.

The Romanian football legend Gheorghe Hagi praised his work in Florence: &quot;In five months he built up a phenomenal side at Fiorentina. Name me another foreigner capable of that. He&#x27;s extraordinary – he could coach any side.&quot; Prior his leave from Florence there were rumours that Terim would join Milan next season.

=== Milan ===

On 18 June 2001, Terim signed a two-year contract with Milan replacing the caretaker manager Cesare Maldini. He transformed Milan&#x27;s system, employing a style very similar to the total football of Rinus Michels, playing a 4–3–1–2 formation with Rui Costa as a key player, whom he brought from his previous team, Fiorentina. Terim built a highly attacking side, but during this period Milan was also notorious for being vulnerable at the back, often conceding goals unexpectedly and drawing against &quot;underdog&quot; teams.
On 5 November 2001, after the 0–1 defeat against Torino his contract was terminated after only five months of work and he was replaced by Carlo Ancelotti, despite the fact that Terim had received a vote of confidence from Milan vice-president Galliani following a 1–1 draw with bottom-placed Venezia in mid-October. However Paolo Maldini had admitted that the players must share the blame for Terim&#x27;s sacking as manager: &quot;Terim&#x27;s failure was also our failure. Now the team must look at themselves as there are no more excuses. Maybe it was the players&#x27; fault because we couldn&#x27;t put Terim&#x27;s teachings into action&quot;. Another reaction was made by midfielder Brocchi about the pressure from the board of directors to Terim: &quot;From the beginning there was a lot of external pressure on Terim as well as many dubious episodes that made one think there wasn&#x27;t 100% faith in him&quot;.

=== Return to Galatasaray (second term) ===
In the summer of 2002, Terim returned to Galatasaray after Lucescu resigned at the end of the 2001-2002 season despite winning the league. Terim brought back Ümit Davala and Hakan Ünsal from the UEFA Cup winning squad and transferred Felipe to the number 10 position. On 11 August 2002, Terim&#x27;s second Galatasaray campaign started successfully with a 4–1 victory over Samsunspor in the first week of the Süper Lig. After going undefeated for the first 10 weeks, the team suffered a historic 6-0 defeat to arch-rival Fenerbahçe on 6 November 2002. In the same period, the team was also eliminated in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League after a disappointing performance. Although Galatasaray improved its performance under Terim later on, and had a winning streak in the league, it lost to Beşiktaş on 25 May 2003 with a last minute goal scored by Sergen Yalçın and lost the championship to Beşiktaş, coached by Lucescu.

In the 2003-04 season, while strengthening his squad with Hakan Şükür, he mainly transferred Romanian players to the team. Galatasaray managed to qualify for the Champions League groups again after passing the preliminary qualifiers. However, towards the end of the year, things started to go badly for the team. First, the team was eliminated in the Turkish Cup, losing 5-0 to Çaykur Rizespor. Then, Villarreal eliminated Galatasaray in the UEFA Cup third qualifying round by defeating them 3-0. Galatasaray dropped out of the championship race with consecutive point losses in the league and Fatih Terim resigned in March 2004, following a 2–1 loss at home to Çaykur Rizespor. Terim would later go on to state that he would never manage Galatasaray again. Clubs such as Inter Milan and Roma tried to lure him back to Serie A, but he did not depart.

=== Turkey (second term) ===
In the summer of 2005, Terim became the manager of the Turkey national team for a second time, taking charge of their last three qualifying matches (held in September and October 2005) – against Denmark, Ukraine and Albania – in UEFA qualifying Group 2 of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Turkey finished second in the group and thus advanced to the two-leg play-off against Switzerland, who won the first leg 2–0 in Bern. Turkey won the second leg 4–2 in Istanbul, but Switzerland advanced to the 2006 World Cup finals on the away goals rule. The return match in Istanbul was marked by controversial attempts to destabilize the Swiss team before the match. The final whistle was followed by violence, and Swiss defender Stéphane Grichting was seriously injured. Turkey national team was sanctioned by a fine and six official home matches behind closed doors and on neutral ground by the FIFA.

Turkey started Euro 2008 by losing to Portugal. Against Switzerland, they were trailing at half-time but snatched a win two minutes into stoppage time. In the final group match, against the Czech Republic, Turkey reversed a two-goal deficit by scoring three goals in the final 15 minutes. Their evenly matched quarter-final clash with Croatia went to a penalty shootout, which Turkey won. Turkey lost to Germany in the semi-finals. During their estimated 490 minutes of playing time in this tournament, Turkey only led for 13 minutes.

After the successful Euro 2008 campaign, Terim was recommended by former Newcastle United manager Bobby Robson for the Newcastle position, but he was not appointed. Terim&#x27;s contract was extended to 2012 at the conclusion of the tournament, despite heavy speculation that he might return to Italy or go to England to manage at club level.

In 2010 World Cup UEFA qualifying, Group 5, as of April 2009, Turkey had won two matches, drawn two and lost two, leaving them four points behind second-placed Bosnia and Herzegovina. This performance saw Turkey move up to tenth position in the FIFA World Rankings. On 11 October 2009, seeing that his country could no longer finish in the top two of Group 5, Terim announced his resignation. Turkey finished Group 5 in third position.

=== Third term at Galatasaray ===

Galatasaray failed to qualify for European football in the 2010–11 season. After internal conflict among board members, and the poor performance of the team during the 2010–11 Süper Lig season, Galatasaray appointed a new chairman, Ünal Aysal. Aysal&#x27;s first act was to appoint Terim, his first and only choice, as manager – his third time to manage Galatasaray.

Galatasaray finished the 2011–12 Süper Lig season with 77 points, nine points ahead of rivals Fenerbahçe. The top four teams in the regular season – Galatasaray, Fenerbahçe, Trabzonspor and Beşiktaş – entered the Championship Group of the European play-offs. A new round-robin play-off format was introduced this season for the first time in the Süper Lig. In the last round of the play-offs, Galatasaray won its 18th title with a scoreless draw against Fenerbahçe at the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium. It was one of Galatasaray&#x27;s best seasons, marked by the good performances of young players such as Semih Kaya and Emre Çolak.

In the third week of the 2012–13 Süper Lig season, Terim earned his 200th win as a Galatasaray coach against Bursaspor. In addition, Terim was invited to the UEFA Elite Managers Forum for a second time in 2012. (The first time was in 2002.) Galatasaray made a poor start to the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League season, losing the first two group matches in Group H, but they won three of their last four group matches to advance to the Round of 16. Galatasaray player Burak Yılmaz finished the group stages of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League as top scorer, with 6 goals in 501 minutes, ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored the same number of goals in 540 minutes.
During the winter transfer window Terim&#x27;s Galatasaray transferred both Wesley Sneijder and Didier Drogba to strengthen the team towards the knockout phase of the Champions League.
In the round of 16, Galatasaray eliminated Schalke 04 4–3 on aggregate. In the quarter-finals, they played Real Madrid – their first official match since the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League. Galatasaray lost 3–0 at Santiago Bernabéu, but won the second clash 3–2 in Ali Sami Yen with a beautiful heel goal by Didier Drogba but eliminated from the European competition by losing on aggregate.
On 5 May 2013, Galatasaray secured its 19th title in the Süper Lig two weeks before the end of the season.

On 24 September 2013, Terim was relieved of his club duties after overseeing one win and three draws in four league matches in the 2013–14 Süper Lig season, plus a 6–1 home defeat in the 2013–14 Champions League group stage opening match against Real Madrid. The club&#x27;s decision to sack Terim was taken after Terim and the board members had held a two-hour meeting at the Türk Telekom Arena in the afternoon of 24 September, followed by a unanimous vote by the board. The club stated Terim had rejected an offer of a two-year extension on his current contract, which had been due to expire in June 2014. Terim was directing a training session at the club&#x27;s facilities when the board&#x27;s decision was publicised later that day. As the news filtered out, dozens of supporters reportedly assembled in front of the training facilities to protest the decision, calling on the board to resign.

=== Turkey (third term) ===

On 22 August 2013, Terim was appointed interim manager of Turkey, replacing Abdullah Avcı, ahead of four critical 2014 World Cup UEFA Group D qualifying matches. Turkey won their next three qualifying matches (against Andorra, Romania and Estonia), but lost their last qualifying match against the Netherlands 2–0 in Istanbul. Turkey finished Group D in fourth position and therefore did not qualify for the 2014 World Cup finals.

After parting ways with Galatasaray, Terim decided to continue with the national team and took charge of Turkey in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers, in which the number of participating teams was increased. Turkey, who started the group matches very badly, had a chance to quality out of its group again by defeating the Netherlands 3-0 at home on 6 September 2015. On 10 October 2015, Turkey beat the Czech Republic 2-0 away from home and three days later, in the match against Iceland, Turkey won the match 1-0 with a free kick goal scored by Selçuk İnan in the 89th minute and finished third in the group.

=== Fourth term at Galatasaray ===
On 22 December 2017, Terim was announced as manager of Galatasaray, replacing Igor Tudor, on a contract that would have see him at the helm until the end of the 2018–19 season.

In the 2017–18 season, he became a seventh-time Turkish Süper Lig winner with Galatasaray. On 19 May 2019, Galatasaray became the champion of 2018–19 Süper Lig season in week 33, one week beforehand the end of the season. Terim won his eighth title in total and second consecutive Süper Lig trophy with Galatasaray. On 25 May 2019, during the cup ceremony at Ali Sami Yen, Galatasaray president Mustafa Cengiz announced that the club agreed on a 2+3 years new deal with Terim. He signed the new contract in front of 52,500 spectators. On 8 July 2019, Terim celebrated his 45th anniversary with Galatasaray. Galatasaray finished the 2020-21 season in second place, on goal difference and therefore did not become the champion for two consecutive seasons.

On 19 July 2021, the recently elected Galatasaray president Burak Elmas announced that they have signed a 3-year contract extension with Terim. This season was one of the toughest seasons for him at the club. Players such as Falcao and Donk had left the club and Terim had decided to invest in young potential players such as Cicâldău, Boey, Nelsson and Moruțan. However, early elimination from the Champions League (qualifying round) as well as many consecutive losses in Süper Lig (ended tenth by mid-season, 19 points behind the leader) caused lots of criticism of the coach by the fans and media. Galatasaray had ended the UEFA Europa League group stage on top position and Terim achieved the one and only positive result so far this season by qualifying to the round of 16 directly. However, after elimination against TFF First League side Denizlispor in the cup and a new defeat against Giresunspor at beginning of the second half of the season, many fans started calling the coach to resignation.

On 10 January 2022, he was relieved from his contract after the poor results and replaced by Spanish coach Domènec Torrent.
On 13 January 2022, Terim shared a photo of his signature regarding the contract termination by the club via his personal social media account, mentioning that it was his last signature at Galatasaray.

=== Panathinaikos ===
On 26 December 2023, Terim signed a one-and-a-half-year contract with Greek club Panathinaikos, replacing Ivan Jovanović. On 17 May 2024, Terim was relieved from his contract.

=== Al Shabab ===
On 27 December 2024 Saudi Arabian club Al Shabab appointed Terim as head coach, signing him on a six-month contract with an option for an additional year.

== Personal life ==
He was born in Adana, Turkey, to Nuriye and Talat Terim. Talat, his father, is a Turkish Cypriot who emigrated to Turkey. He is married to Fulya Terim. They have two daughters, Merve and Buse.

<doc id="1244892" wikidata="Q3452025" url="?curid=1244892" title="Charlotte Stuart, Duchess of Albany">
<text>Charlotte Stuart, styled Duchess of Albany (29 October 1753 – 17 November 1789) was the illegitimate daughter of the Jacobite pretender Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot; or the &quot;Young Pretender&quot;) and his only child to survive infancy.

Charlotte&#x27;s mother was Clementina Walkinshaw, who was mistress to Charles Edward from 1752 until 1760. After years of abuse, Clementina left him, taking Charlotte with her. Charlotte spent most of her life in French convents, estranged from a father who refused to make any provision for her. Unable to marry, she herself became a mistress with illegitimate children, taking Ferdinand de Rohan, Archbishop of Bordeaux, as her lover.

She was finally reconciled with her father in 1784, when he legitimised her and created her Duchess of Albany in the Jacobite peerage. She left her children with her mother, and became her father&#x27;s carer and companion in the last years of his life, before dying less than two years after him. Her offspring was raised in anonymity; however, as Prince Charles Stuart&#x27;s only grandchildren, they have been the subject of Jacobite interest since their lineage was uncovered in the 20th century.

==Royal parentage==
Charlotte Stuart was born on 29 October 1753 at Liège to Charles and his mistress, Clementina Walkinshaw. Charles and Clementina had met during the Jacobite rising of 1745, when he came to Scotland from France in an attempt to regain by force the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland, which had been lost by his grandfather, James II and VII in 1689. Clementina was the youngest of the ten daughters of John Walkinshaw of Barrowhill. The Walkinshaws owned the lands of Barrowfield and Camlachie, and her father had become a wealthy Glasgow merchant (founding the textile village of Calton). However, he was also an Episcopalian Protestant and a Jacobite who had fought for the Prince&#x27;s father in the rising of 1715, been captured at the Battle of Sheriffmuir, before escaping from Stirling Castle and fleeing to continental Europe. In 1717, he had been pardoned by the British government and returned to Glasgow, where his youngest daughter was born probably at Camlachie. However, Clementina was largely educated on the Continent and later converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1746, she was living at the home of her uncle Sir Hugh Paterson at Bannockburn, near Stirling. The Prince came to Sir Hugh&#x27;s home in early January 1746, where he first met Clementina, and he returned later that month to be nursed by her from what appears to have been a cold. Since she was living under her uncle&#x27;s protection, it is not thought the two were lovers at the time.

After the defeat of the Prince&#x27;s rebellion at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746, Charles fled Scotland for France. In the following years, he had a scandalous affair with his 22-year-old first cousin Louise de Montbazon, who was married to his close friend and whom he deserted when she became pregnant, and then with the Princess of Talmont, who was in her forties. In 1752, he heard that Clementina was at Dunkirk and in some financial difficulties and so he sent 50 louis d&#x27;or to help her and then dispatched Sir Henry Goring to entreat her to come to Ghent and to live with him as his mistress. Goring, who described Clementina as a &quot;bad woman&quot;, complained of being used as &quot;no better than a pimp&quot; and soon left Charles&#x27;s employ. However, by November 1752, Clementina was living with Charles and would remain as his mistress for the following eight years. The couple moved to Liège where Charlotte, their only child, was born on 29 October 1753 and baptised into the Roman Catholic faith at the church of Notre Dame-des-Fonts in Liège.

==Separation from father (1760–1783)==
The relationship between the prince and Charlotte&#x27;s mother was disastrous. Charles was already a disillusioned, angry alcoholic when they began living together, and he became violent towards and insanely possessive of Clementina, treating her as a &quot;submissive whipping post&quot;. Often away from home on &quot;jaunts&quot;, he seldom referred to his daughter, and when he did, it was as &quot;ye cheild&quot;. During a temporary move to Paris, the Prince&#x27;s lieutenants record ugly public arguments between the two and that his drunkenness and temper were damaging his reputation. By 1760, they were in Basel, and Clementina had had enough of Charles&#x27;s intoxication and their nomadic lifestyle. She contacted his staunchly Roman Catholic father, James Stuart, and expressed a desire to secure a Catholic education for Charlotte, and to retire to a convent. James agreed to pay her an annuity of 10,000 livres and, in July 1760, there is evidence to suggest he aided her escape from the watchful Charles, with the seven-year-old Charlotte, to the convent of the Nuns of the Visitation in Paris. She left a letter for Charles expressing her devotion to him but complaining she had to flee in fear of her life. A furious Charles circulated descriptions of them both, but it was to no avail.

===Appeals from France===
For the next twelve years, Clementina and Charlotte continued to live in various French convents, supported by the 10,000-livre pension granted by James Stuart. Charles never forgave Clementina for depriving him of &quot;ye cheild&quot;, and stubbornly refused to pay anything for their support. On 1 January 1766 James died, but Charles, now considering himself &quot;de jure&quot; Charles III of Scotland, England and Ireland, still refused to make any provision for the two, forcing Clementina, now styling herself Countess Alberstroff, to appeal to his brother Cardinal Henry Stuart for assistance. Henry gave them an allowance of 5,000 livres, but in return extracted a statement from Clementina that she had never been married to Charles—a statement she later tried to retract.

In 1772, the Prince, then aged fifty-one, married the nineteen-year-old Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, who was only a year older than Charlotte. Charlotte, now in penury, had consistently been writing to her father for some time, and she now desperately entreated him to legitimise her, provide support and bring her to Rome before an heir could be born. In April 1772, Charlotte wrote a touching, yet pleading, letter to &quot;mon Auguste Papa&quot; which was sent via Principal Gordon of the Scots College in Rome. Charles relented and offered to bring Charlotte to Rome—he was now resident in the Palazzo Muti, the residence of the Stuarts-in-exile—but only on condition she would leave her mother behind in France. This she loyally refused to do, and Charles, in fury, broke off all discussions.

===Mistress of an Archbishop===

Towards the end of 1772, Clementina and Charlotte unexpectedly arrived in Rome to press their desperate cause in person. However, the Prince reacted angrily, refusing even to see them, forcing their helpless return to France, from where Charlotte&#x27;s pleading letters continued. Three years later, Charlotte, now in her twenty-second year was in poor health. She was apparently suffering from a liver ailment shared by the Stuarts and decided her only option was to marry as soon as possible. Charles, however, refused to give permission either for her to marry or to take the veil, and she was left awaiting his royal pleasure.
Lacking legitimacy or permission, Charlotte was unable to marry. Therefore she sought a protector and provider. Probably unbeknown to Charles, she became the mistress of Ferdinand Maximilien Mériadec de Rohan, Archbishop of Bordeaux and Cambrai. Ferdinand de Rohan—related by blood to the house of Stuart as well as Bourbon and Lorraine—was also unable to marry legitimately, having entered the Church as a younger son of a noble house. By him, she had at least three children: two daughters, Charlotte Maximilienne Amélie and Marie Victoire or Victoire Adélaïde, and finally a son, Charles Edward. Her children were kept secret and remained largely unknown until the 20th century. When Charlotte eventually left France for Florence, she entrusted her children, and she was only just recovering from her son&#x27;s birth, to the care of her mother, and it appears that few, and certainly not her father, knew of their existence.

==Reconciliation with her father==
Only after his childless marriage to Louise was over, and Charles had fallen seriously ill, did he take an interest in Charlotte. She was now thirty and she had not seen her father since she was seven. On 23 March 1783, he altered his will to make her his heir and, a week later, signed an act of legitimisation. This act, recognising her as his natural daughter and entitling her to succeed to his private estate, was sent to Louis XVI of France. Henry Stuart, however, contested the legitimisation as being irregular and confusing to the succession. Louis XVI eventually did confirm the act and register it with the Parlement of Paris, but not until 6 September 1787.

In July 1784, having granted his wife Louise a legal separation, Charles wrote to his daughter calling her &quot;ma chère fille&quot;. In his letter, he summoned Charlotte to Florence, where he was now resident. She arrived in Florence on 5 October 1784. In November, he installed her in the Palazzo Guadagni as Duchess of Albany, styling her &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;. Nevertheless, being illegitimate at birth, Charlotte still had no right of succession to the Stuart claim to the British throne. However, by this stage, the claims were of little value. European rulers had long since ceased to take Charles seriously. Even Pope Pius VI was refusing to recognise his royal title, and the famous Casanova had wittily called him the &quot;pretender-in-vain&quot;. He was reduced to styling himself the Count d&#x27;Albany.

That a Stuart restoration was now less than unlikely did not prevent the Prince presenting Charlotte as the next generation of the cause. On 30 November 1784, Charles held a &#x27;State&#x27; banquet for Charlotte and invested her with the Order of the Thistle. He had medals struck for her, bearing the figure of Hope, the map of England, and the Stuart arms with legends such as &quot;Spes Tamen Est Una&quot; (&quot;there is one hope&quot;). He also had her idealised in art; the Scottish artist Gavin Hamilton was commissioned to draw her in chalk in the neo-classical style, whilst Hugh Douglas Hamilton painted a flattering portrait in a tiara.

===Companion to her father===
When Charlotte arrived to live with her father in 1784, he was an ailing alcoholic. She found his physical state disgusting, and he was suffering from mental degeneration and using a litter for travel. He did, however, introduce Charlotte into society, allowing her to wear his mother&#x27;s famous Sobieska jewellery. She continually, and unsuccessfully, sought gifts of jewels or money from her close-fisted father; but this was probably largely out of a concern for the welfare of her mother and children. Within a month of arriving at Florence, she did manage to persuade her father to provide at last for Clementina. By this time, Charlotte was also in poor health, suffering from an ailment that would result in her death from &quot;obstruction of the liver&quot; just two years after her father. Indeed, shortly after she arrived in Florence, a protruding growth forced her to have clothes altered. The biographer Douglas reports that around this time, a visitor described her as:
a tall, robust woman of a very dark complexion and a coarse-grained skin, with more of a masculine boldness than feminine modesty or elegancy, but easy and unassuming in her manners, amply possessed of... volubility of tongue and... spirit of coquetry.

Charlotte sorely missed her mother (whom she vainly hoped Charles would allow to come to Rome) and her children, writing to her mother as many as 100 times in a single year; she also feared that Rohan would take another lover; all this is revealed in her dispirited letters home, as she awaited Charles&#x27;s death. She was successful in helping to organise her father&#x27;s social life, as well as in persuading him to reduce his drinking in his final years. When staying for a short visit in Pisa with her father, she made a separate visit to her uncle Henry Stuart who was at Perugia. There she was successful in arranging a reconciliation between Henry and Charles.

===Final months===
In December 1785, she enlisted the help of Henry Stuart to get Charles back to the Palazzo Muti in Rome. On arrival in Rome with her father, the Pope welcomed Charlotte as the &quot;Duchess of Albany&quot;. In Rome, Charlotte remained her father&#x27;s carer and companion, and did her best to make his life bearable until he died of a stroke two years later on 30 January 1788. Her sacrifice for him was considerable—she was torn between an evident affection for her father in Rome and her mother and children left behind in Paris. On her father&#x27;s death, the French court awarded her a pension of 20,000 livres. Charlotte inherited much of her father&#x27;s property, including his Florentine residence, furniture and ornaments, although many of the Sobieski family jewels passed to Henry Stuart. She subsequently sold the Florentine palace and much of the possessions. 

Charlotte would spend much of her final months in the company of Henry Stuart. She also became godmother to Countess Mary Norton, a member of her court. Charlotte also wrote to her mother about her worsening health, noting that she had a swelling and pain when breathing. She made several trips to improve her health at spa towns, including at Nocera in Umbria and at Bologna where she sought medical treatment. Charlotte was to survive her father by only twenty-two months and never saw her children again. On 9 October 1789, while staying in Bologna at the Palazzo Vizzani Sanguinetti, the home of her friend the Marchesa Giulia Lambertini-Bovio, a relative of Pope Benedict XIV, she died there at age 36 of liver cancer. In her will, written just three days before her death, Charlotte left her mother a sum of 50,000 livres and an annuity of a further 15,000. Her physical possessions, jewels and other personal property passed to Henry. However, it was two years before Henry Stuart, her executor, and now considered by Jacobites to be King Henry IX, would release the money. Indeed, he only agreed to do this when Clementina signed a &quot;quittance&quot; renouncing, on behalf of herself and her descendants, any further claim on the estate. Charlotte was buried in the Church of San Biagio, near where she died, as she had requested in her will. When the church was pulled down by the French in 1797, Charlotte&#x27;s remains were believed to have been moved to the Oratorio della Santissima Trinità in 1801; however, this was not verified. When it closed in 1961, her monument, and possibly her remains, were also moved to the nearby Chiesa della Santissima Trinità but again it is not known for certain where her remains lie.

==Legacy==
For many years, Charlotte&#x27;s children remained unknown to history, and it was believed that the direct line of James II and Mary of Modena ended with the death of Henry in 1807. However, in the 1950s, research by the historians Alasdair and Hetty Tayler revealed the existence of two daughters and a son. The historian George Sherburn then discovered the letters from Charlotte to her mother from which he wrote his biography of Charles Edward.

===Children===
It appears that Clementina lived on in Fribourg, Switzerland, until her death in 1802 and that it was she who reared Charlotte&#x27;s children in deliberate anonymity. Their identities were concealed by a variety of aliases and ruses and were not even being mentioned in Charlotte&#x27;s detailed will, which makes reference only to Clementina and to Charlotte&#x27;s desire that Clementina might be able to provide for &quot;her necessitous relations&quot;. The reason that the children remained secret can be explained by the fact that the relationship between Archbishop Ferdinand de Rohan and Charlotte, who had been forbidden to marry, was highly illicit and would have been scandalous. The girls, arguably Victoire Adélaïde (born between 1781 and spring 1783) and Charlotte Maximilienne Amélie (born 1780), were thought to have been placed in the care of Thomas Coutts, the London banker, and a distant relative of the Walkinshaws. They remained in anonymity and were believed to have been simply absorbed into English society. 

Charlotte&#x27;s son Charles Edward (born in Paris in 1784) followed a different path. Calling himself &quot;Count Roehenstart&quot; (Rohan+Stuart), he was educated by his father&#x27;s family in Germany and became an officer in the Russian army and a general in the Austrian service. He travelled widely by visiting India, America, and the West Indies before he came to England and Scotland. He told such tall tales of his origins and adventures that few believed his claims to royal descent. Indeed, it was not until the 20th century that the historian George Sherburn established that he was indeed who he had claimed to be.He died in Scotland in 1854 as the result of a coach accident near Stirling Castle and was buried at Dunkeld Cathedral, where his grave can still be seen. He married twice but had no issue.

It was generally believed that Charlotte&#x27;s daughters also died without issue, but Peter Pininski believed that Charlotte&#x27;s daughter, (Marie) Victoire Adélaïde, had issue. Pininski&#x27;s 2002 book suggested that Jules-Hercule, Prince de Guéméné and Duke of Montbazon, the elder brother of Ferdinand de Rohan (and aide-de-camp to Henry Stuart in 1745) recognised Charlotte&#x27;s offspring as his own, which gave her status in that tight family, and he claimed that in 1793, at the outbreak of the French Revolution, Marie Victoire de Rohan went to relatives in Poland and there met and married Paul Anthony Louis Bertrand de Nikorowicz, a Polish nobleman and son of a banker. They had a son, Antime, and she later died in Vienna in 1836. Antime was the father of Charles and a daughter, Julia-Thérèse, who married Count Leonard Pininski and became Peter Pininski&#x27;s great-great-grandmother. Pininski&#x27;s evidence for his thesis has been described as &quot;often indirect, if not elliptical&quot;. The Rohans were a large family, and it is easy to confuse its many members. A former chairman of the Royal Stuart Society, however, stated that Pininski&#x27;s evidence seemed &quot;genuine&quot;, and the peerage editor Hugh Massingberd described it as &quot;painstakingly researched ... proof to surely the most sceptical pedant&#x27;s satisfaction&quot;.

Pininski&#x27;s hypothesis is challenged by the genealogist Marie-Louise Backhurst in three articles in 2013, 2021 and 2023. Backhurst provides evidence that Charlotte&#x27;s second daughter, who was always called Victoire Adélaïde, was married firstly at St Roch, Paris, in November 1804 to a military doctor, Pierre Joseph Marie de St Ursin, in the service of Napoleon. The marriage record has Victoire Adélaïde Roehenstart, daughter of Maximilien and his wife, Clementine Ruthven, the same parental record as her brother Charles. By St Ursin, she was the mother of Theodore Marie de St Ursin, who was born in Paris on 29 June 1809 and was resident in Paris in 1832. He had entered the seminary of St Sulpice at Issy in 1828 and been ordained a deacon there that year, but died a deacon, aged 29, at Castres, Tarn, on 6 August 1838. In 1823, his mother had married again, to the naval officer , brother of the adopted son of the Duke of Bouillon, and she eventually died at Nice in March 1871. 

Backhurst has concluded that Madame Nikorowicz was actually Marie Victoire de Rohan, Mademoiselle de Thorigny (born June 1779), and more likely to have been the illegitimate daughter of Jules Hercule Mériadec, Prince de Rohan, brother of Ferdinand and thus a first cousin to Victoire Adélaïde and without the Stuart descent. Pininski had earlier argued that Backhurst&#x27;s interpretation had been based on a destroyed document that was &quot;reconstituted&quot; seventy years later and that no document confirmed the birth of Marie Victoire&#x27;s son.
Since then, Pininski has responded to Backhurst latest articles in a 2024 paper, in which he argues that every piece of evidence concerning Charlotte&#x27;s three children is circumstantial, as their parentage is either false or not given in primary sources. 

Pininski mentions that Charlotte&#x27;s correspondence with her mother indicates the existence of a fourth child, Marie Aglaë, who has not been accounted for (and perhaps died young). He explains this by remarking that the idea Charlotte only had three children as indicated by her letters to her mother might be incorrect, since it could be that the children were not always together. 

Furthermore, while he accepts that Marie Victoire and Victoire Adélaïde were probably different people, he rejects the possibility that the former might have been a natural daughter of Jules de Rohan. Pininski asserts that the two women were most likely siblings, both daughters of Charlotte Stuart and Ferdinand de Rohan. He maintains that the parentage of Madame Nikorowicz given in the baptismal record as Jules Hercule and Marie Grosset (the daughter of his secretary) seems to be fabricated, and refers to the refusal of the Abbé Barnabé of Veigné (near Tours) to baptise Charlotte&#x27;s son, called Auguste Maximilian or Charles Edward, as a child of Jules as evidence. 

According to Pininski, Jules Hercule was not known to have been unfaithful to his wife and would have been unlikely to sire Marie Victoire, as by 1779 he was 53 years old. Neither would he have had reason to recognize the child of &quot;so humble a mother&quot;, nor grant her the prestigious style of &quot;Demoiselle de Thorigny&quot;. Pininski also notes that when Marie Grosset was paid off by Jules de Rohan in 1782 for &quot;services rendered&quot; there was no mention of such a daughter. He argues that had she really been Jules&#x27;s daughter the usual procedure would have been to register her with the French court, but he did not do that as it could have potentially revealed his younger brother&#x27;s secret affair with Charlotte. Instead, he suggests that Jules Hercule might have been motivated by family loyalty to provide status to Charlotte and Ferdinand&#x27;s illegitimate offspring. 

Pininski states that the Nikorowicz clan seem to have had close ties to the Stuarts (through the Radiziwiłłs and even the House of Sobieski), but not to the House of Rohan. He speculates that Marie Victoire&#x27;s marriage to Paul Nikorowicz may have been arranged by Ferdinand de Rohan through Charlotte&#x27;s family connections. Furthermore, Charles Edward de Roehenstart ever only made one explicit reference to a sibling, when he was in financial difficulties in New York in 1813 and asked his one of his sisters for money. Pininski claims this could only have been Madame Nikorowicz (by then a rich widow), as Charlotte Maximilienne had died in childbirth in 1806, and, as pointed by Backhurst herself, Victoire Adélaïde had few resources of her own as the wife of a French military doctor imprisoned by the Russians. 

Pininski observes that throughout her life Marie Victoire never mentioned her mother and that the only hint to her parentage comes from the family arms attributed to Madame Nikorowicz on an official genealogy provided by her great-grandson to the Habsburg court in the 1890s. He notes that her arms have &quot;no similarity to those of Rohan, but instead display the Stuarts&#x27; fess on a gold shield, with only two minor modifications&quot; comparable to the Stuart-based arms Charles Edward designed for himself. 

Pininski concludes that Charlotte may have had four surviving children instead of three, and that perhaps they were divided in two sets of pairs. He points out that several facts of Marie Victoire&#x27;s life indicate a close connection to Charles Edward, as they seem to have frequented the same Central and Eastern European emigré and ultraroyalist circles, and there are obscure references in his personal documents to de Roehenstart&#x27;s Polish heirs. On the other hand, Charlotte Maximilienne and Victoire Adélaïde remained in France and both seem to have married middle-class men.
===In Jacobite folklore===

Charlotte Stuart&#x27;s story did not take long to enter into the Jacobite folklore. The Scots poet, Robert Burns (1759–1796), a near contemporary, wrote a number of works celebrating the tragic romanticism of the Jacobite cause. Amongst them was &quot;The Bonnie Lass of Albanie&quot;, a lament to Charlotte Stuart that was probably written at the time of her death. Indeed, evidence from an unpublished collection of letters from Burns to Robert Ainslie reveals the poet&#x27;s fascination with Charlotte in that he considered naming one of his own illegitimate children, Charlotte, after her. Burns wrote:
&lt;poem&gt;
This lovely maid&#x27;s of royal blood,
That ruled Albion&#x27;s kingdoms three;
But Oh, Alas! for her bonnie face,
They hae wrang&#x27;d the lass of Albany.&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="1244895" wikidata="Q714041" url="?curid=1244895" title="Chin Peng">
<text>Chin Peng (21 October 1924 – 16 September 2013), born Ong Boon Hua, was a Malayan communist politician, guerrilla leader, and revolutionary, who was the leader and commander of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) and the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA). A Maoist, he led the CPM as secretary general from 1947 until the party&#x27;s dissolution in 1989.

Chin was born into a middle-class family in Sitiawan, now a part of Perak. In 1939, at the age of 15, he became a revolutionary and fled to Kuala Lumpur in 1940. He joined the CPM in 1941, and quickly involved himself in local party committees and labour unions in Perak. Throughout the Second World War, Chin fought as an anti-colonialist guerrilla in the Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA) against the Japanese occupation of Malaya, allying with Force 136, a British-funded covert resistance movement in Asia. He was subsequently awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

As the most senior surviving member of the CPM to emerge from the war, he founded the MNLA and engaged in a guerrilla war known as the Malayan Emergency against the British Empire and Commonwealth forces between 1948 and 1960, in a failed attempt to establish an independent Marxist–Leninist state in Malaya. His actions led to the revocation of his OBE. After the British–led independence of Malaya and the defeat of the CPM, Chin went into exile in China, then Thailand, and waged a second guerrilla campaign between 1968 and 1989 against the now independent Malaysian government. This campaign did not succeed, and ended with a final peace agreement in 1989, which dissolved the CPM permanently. He was however not permitted to return, and Chin died in exile in Bangkok, Thailand in 2013; he was 88.

Chin is considered one of the most controversial political figures in Malayan history. His detractors condemned him and the MNLA for committing numerous atrocities during the Emergency, and characterised him as an ideological fanatic and terrorist. However, he was also credited for contributing towards the Malayan independence process, and was seen as a prominent rebel leader and anti-imperialist against colonialism in Malaya. He was the last surviving postwar revolutionary leader to have successfully fought for independence from colonialism in Asia.

== Early life ==

=== Youth years ===

Chin Peng was born Ong Boon Hua on 21 October 1924 into a middle-class family in the small seaside town of Sitiawan, Dindings, which at the time was a part of the Straits Settlements. His ancestral home was in Fuqing, Fujian, China. His father went to live in Sitiawan in 1920, and set up a bicycle, tire, and spare motor parts business with the help of a relative from Singapore, known as Ong Lock Cho.

Chin Peng attended a Chinese language school in Sitiawan. In 1937 he joined the Chinese Anti Enemy Backing Up Society (AEBUS), formed that year to send aid to China in response to Japan&#x27;s aggression. According to Chin and Hack, he was not a communist then. He was in charge of anti-Japanese activities at his school, and was reportedly a supporter of Sun Yat-sen.

=== First participation in communism ===
By early 1939, Chin had embraced communism. He planned to go to Yan&#x27;an, the renowned communist base in China but was persuaded to remain in Malaya and take on heavier responsibilities in the newly formed Malayan Communist Party.

In late 1939, when Chin Peng was in the 4th year of his secondary school education (known as senior middle-level one), his school announced that the senior middle section was to be closed due to lack of funds. He decided to continue his education in the Methodist-run Anglo-Chinese Continuation School, which operated in English, because it provided a good cover for his underground activities. He did not want to have to move to Singapore to continue with his education in Chinese. He left the school &quot;for fear of British harassment&quot; after just 6 months. He was now focused fully on his political activities and became, from that point on, a full-time revolutionary. In January 1940 he was put in charge of three anti-Japanese organisations that were targeting students, teachers, members of cultural activities, and general labourers. At the end of January 1940, he was admitted to the Malayan Communist Party as a member.

== Early revolutionary activity ==
Harassment by the authorities led him to leave his home town for Kuala Kangsar in July 1940. Later he spent a month in Taiping. In September 1940 the party posted him to Ipoh as a standing committee member for Perak. In December he attained full party membership.

In early 1941 AEBUS was dissolved. Chin Peng became Ipoh District committee member of the party. &quot;He led student underground cells of three Chinese secondary schools and the Party&#x27;s organisations of the shop assistants, domestic servants of European families, workers at brick kilns and barbers.&quot;

In June 1941 he became a member of the Perak State Committee.

=== Second World War ===
Chin Peng rose to prominence during World War II when many Chinese Malayans took to the jungle to fight a guerrilla war against the Japanese. These fighters, inspired by the example of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), became known as the Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA). Chin Peng became the liaison officer between the MPAJA and the British military in Southeast Asia.

The Japanese invasion of Malaya began in December 1941. In 1942 Chin was the youngest of three members of the Secretariat of the Perak State Committee: Su Yew Meng was secretary and Chang Meng Ching was the other member. In early 1943 the two senior members were captured by the Japanese, which left Chin Peng in charge. Contact with the Party&#x27;s Central Committee had been lost; he attempted to re-establish it, travelling to Kuala Lumpur and meeting Chai Ker Meng. Later, party leader Lai Tek sent another Central Committee member, Lee Siow Peng (Siao Ping), to replace Chin as State Secretary. However, Lee Siow Peng was captured not long after while travelling to a meeting that was to be held in Singapore.

Thus the job of establishing contact with the British commando Force 136 fell to Chin Peng. The first party of that force, consisting of Captain John Davis and five Chinese agents had landed in Malaya on 24 May 1943, by submarine. Chin Peng made contact with the group on 30 September 1943. He was active in his support for the British stay-behind troops but had no illusions about their failure to protect Malaya against the Japanese. In the course of this activity, he came into contact with Freddie Spencer Chapman, who called him a &#x27;true friend&#x27; in his Malayan jungle memoir, &quot;The Jungle Is Neutral&quot;.

In recognition of his service during the war, Chin was awarded an Order of the British Empire (OBE) (though it was later withdrawn by the British government), a mention in despatches and two campaign medals by Britain. He was elected the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Malaya after the previous leader Lai Tek, had turned out to be an agent for both the British and the Japanese and had denounced the leadership of the party to the Japanese secret police. Chin Peng was the most senior surviving member.

=== Before the Emergency ===

In 1948, the Federation of Malaya plan replaced the Malayan Union plan, frustrating the CPM as they felt the plan was undemocratic and biased towards the Malay elites. They accused the British of forcing idea of federation on people by portraying it as a constitutional solution to Malaya&#x27;s crisis. According to Chin, the central committee still adhered to Lai Teck&#x27;s peace struggle strategy in facing the federation, as they thought that the people of Malaya were still recovering from the horrors of the Japanese occupation. To launch an armed rebellion so soon would not only cause them to lose support of the masses but would also drive the already wary Malays to openly resist them.

Some scholars allege that the CPM received secret directives from Moscow agents on the methods and timing for a near-simultaneous uprising against colonial authorities during the Southeast Asian Youth Conference held in Calcutta on 19 February 1948 which eventually caused the CPM&#x27;s insurrection. Chin denied it, stating that the conference argued against such a move. Lance Sharkey, party secretary of the Australian Communist Party, informed Chin and the central committee of the conference&#x27;s decision while stopping over in Singapore on his way home. In March 1948, the central committees were discussing new policies as the labour strikes were not bringing the results that they hoped for. Chin Peng estimated it would be a year or two before the British took actions against the CPM, leaving them ample time to prepare for a guerrilla war.

On 12 June 1948, the colonial government outlawed the burgeoning trade union federations amid rising tensions. Since then, there was no reduction in the level of violent activities, other than the neutralisation of trade unions. Political murders of informers, anyone found to be working against the labour movement or the CPM, non-Europeans considered enemies to the communist cause or strike-breakers who used thugs and gangsters to harass protesters rose. The murder of three Kuomintang leaders in Johor on 12 June had convinced the British that the communists were escalating the conflict in retaliation for outlawing the trade unions, while in the CPM&#x27;s eyes these murders were just purely acts of intimidation. Chin again claimed that he was not aware of the murders at the time, although he approved of the later killing of the plantation managers who he claimed were harsh and cruel towards farmworkers.

== Leadership of the Malayan Communist Party ==

=== The Emergency (1948–1989) ===

On 16 June 1948, three European plantation managers were murdered in Sungai Siput, which has generally been identified as the incident which caused the Malayan colonial administration to declare a state of emergency. Rather, Sze-Chieh Ng argued these murders were merely the final catalyst for a long-brewing crisis that had been going on since the trade unions began agitating in 1945. Historian Anthony Short feels that this was more of a panic reaction than a carefully considered move. According to him, the government had been powerless to deal with the unrest plaguing Malaya since 1945. According to Purcell&#x27;s viewpoint, the Emergency was declared in response to increasing incidents of violence and lawlessness.

Many Singaporean historians and anti-communists allege that Chin Peng ordered the killings. Chin claimed he had no prior knowledge of the plot. He added that he barely escaped arrest, losing his passport in the process, and he lost touch with the party for a couple of days. Chin became the most wanted man of the British government, with the government offering a reward of $250,000 for his capture. On 17 July 1948, CPM offices in Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Singapore, and other major cities were raided, followed by mass arrests of suspected communists and anti-government individuals on 21 July. The CPM was banned in July 1948.

In response to the Emergency and the mass arrests of its members, the CPM issued a call to its members to revive its disbanded wartime resistance army, the MPAJA, to take up arms again and escape to the jungles. Since late May and early June the communists had been secretly setting up platoons in several states in preparation for an expected British crackdown in September. The sudden declaration of the Emergency in June, however, forced the MCP to hasten its plan, and they appealed to comrades and volunteers to join them in the struggle. The new guerrilla army, now known as the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), spent the first year of the Emergency reconsolidating and rearming.

At that time, the CPM was in chaos. Its members were dispersed in the jungle and operated without any command structure or central leadership. According to Chin, attacks were being carried out without his approval or knowledge and there was no coordination among units. The guerrillas endured heavy casualties and made few or no strategic gains in the early months. Chin was desperate to assert control over the MNLA, which had been operating independently since June. It was not until August that some form of central authority was finally set up in the Cameron Highlands, with Chin ordering the guerrillas to adopt Mao Zedong&#x27;s strategy of establishing liberated zones whenever they drove British forces from an area. However, this strategy failed. British forces continued to hound the guerrillas, who were often forced to retreat deeper into the jungles and disperse into smaller units due to difficulties in resupplying and the risk of larger units being detected and annihilated by British patrols.

Furthermore, the CPM was losing civilian support, and lacking material assistance and intelligence, the party suffered. Chin admitted they had wrongly assumed that the people would be willing support his men, as they had done during World War II. When that failed to happen, they resorted to force to satisfy their needs.

The CPM and MNLA also suffered under British propaganda, which labelled them &quot;bandits&quot; and &quot;communist terrorists&quot;. Old suspicions and assumptions that the CPM had clandestine support from either the CCP or the Soviet Union had, over time, hardened into certainty. Records disclosed after the Cold War ended disproved the claim, revealing that the CPM had not sought external support and that no agents from either China or the Soviet Union had even made contact with them. The only ‘support’ Chin recalled obtaining was the encouraging news that Mao&#x27;s guerrillas had defeated Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s well-equipped and numerically superior KMT army in 1949.

==== Briggs Plan ====

In 1950, a series of strategies were introduced by the Director of Operations for the anti-communist war in Malaya, Lieutenant General Sir Harold Briggs, that later became known as the Briggs Plan. The plan, which aimed to defeat the guerrillas by cutting off their sources of civilian support, was a success. The creation of &#x27;new villages&#x27; under this plan restricted intelligence and food supplies for the CPM, and thus had a devastating effect on the guerrillas. Chin was aware of this as he nearly starved several times during those twelve years.

After several reviews and amendments, the CPM ordered the guerrillas to cease sabotage and terror operations and to develop closer ties with the middle-class to preserve their organizational strength. Chin would later admit in an interview in 1999 that this directive was a mistake as it allowed the British to press on with their attacks on the MNLA, whom they correctly assessed to be quite demoralised by then.

After Sir Harold Briggs died, Lieutenant General Sir Gerald Templer was appointed as the new commander, introducing aggressive strategies which differed from the Briggs Plan. These included interrogations, food rationing, large monetary rewards for captured or killed communists coupled with intense military operations, and the mobilisation of a large number of troops to hound the guerrillas. In 1953, the CPM relocated their headquarters to Betong, in southern Thailand. They reestablished its networks to connect the scattered units and review its strategy.

In late 1953 and early 1954, the war was at a semi-stalemate due to both the MNLA and the British being unable to decisively defeat one another. In early 1954, Siao Chang, a top CPM leader who had been sent to Beijing in late 1952 to deepen his Marxist–Leninist education while also serving as liaison to the CCP, announced a new direction for the party, which was to abandon the establishment of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Malaya and join with other Malayan political parties in a legal fight for Malayan independence. Chin described Siao as the CPM&#x27;s &#x27;insurance policy&#x27; in the event the central committee was eliminated.

Although this was not their decision, Chin and the other central committees decided to join the other Malayan parties, reasoning that the Malay politicians had achieved more for the independence movement within the last few years than the MNLA had since 1948. The Beijing announcement also revealed to the CPM that both the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China had viewed the armed struggle in Malaya as untenable.

=== Baling talks, 1955 ===
On 24 September 1955, Chin wrote to Tunku Abdul Rahman offering to negotiate peace. On 17 October, talks between two government representatives and Chin Peng and another central committee of the CPM were held at Klian Intan. A new &#x27;Eight Point Program&#x27; was introduced by the CPM which called for an end to the Emergency and a cessation of hostilities, a reformation of Malaya&#x27;s political system, expanding democratic rights, support for world peace, and attention to other matters including education, health, welfare, and industrial production.

On 28 and 29 December 1955, the negotiations reached their peak at the small northern town of Baling in Kedah. Representatives from the Government were Tunku Abdul Rahman, David Marshall, the Chief Minister of Singapore, and Sir Tan Cheng Lock, the leader of the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA). The CPM was represented by Chin Peng, Chen Tian, and Abdul Rashid bin Maidin. The first day of the talks did not go well, as Chin wanted the CPM to be recognised as a legal party again, or for the leaders and members of the MNLA to at least be allowed to regain their freedom of movement and not face any legal persecution or imprisonment. Tunku Abdul Rahman rejected this request and demanded that the CPM fully surrender as the only way to peace, but promised that those who surrendered would undergo a period of rehabilitation before being allowed to become free citizens again.

Chin again argued freedom of thought and choice must be recognised by the Malayan government if the new nation was to survive past its independence, as the people should have the right to decide which political path the nation should take rather than having that choice be decided by a select few in the government. Tunku Abdul Rahman rejected this as well and only promised freedom for the CPM members to join any existing political party after being cleared by the authorities.

On the second day of the talks, Chin promised that the CPM would stop fighting and lay down its arms if the Alliance government persuaded the British government to grant it authority over internal security and defence. Tunku Abdul Rahman accepted it as a challenge and promised that he would push for it on his upcoming trip to London. Great publicity was given in the media to this dramatic challenge from Chin Peng. The challenge, indeed, served to strengthen the Alliance government&#x27;s bargaining position at the London talks. Anxious to end the Emergency, the British government agreed to concede those powers of internal security and defence and to accede to the demand for independence for Malaya by 31 August 1957, if possible. Chin claimed it was his challenge to Tunku Abdul Rahman that hastened the independence of Malaya. Tunku Abdul Rahman had acknowledged the importance of the Baling talks, writing in 1974 that &quot;Baling had led straight to Merdeka (Independence).&quot;

Regardless, the talks themselves ended without a consensus between the two sides. Though the talks collapsed they were regarded as both a success and failure for Tunku Abdul Rahman, as the talks made the British regard him as a strong leader who was tough on communism. His performance also impressed the Colonial Office enough to grant Malaya independence. For the CPM, it was a very demoralising affair that nearly destroyed their already ailing struggle. The failure of the Baling Talks was a great blow for the CPM, since they now lost hope both of ending the war and of propagating their ideology. Due to the mounting combat casualties and the insecurity of food supplies, the members began surrendering to the government in exchange for monetary rewards and pardons.

In 1956, Chin wrote to Tunku Abdul Rahman offering to resume negotiations. This was rejected by Rahman in a broadcast on 2 April. By late 1958, the MNLA had lost almost 88% of its men, declining from an approximately 3,000-strong army when they first rebelled in mid-1948 to no more than 350 men, as a result of casualties and surrenders.

In 1959, the central committees of CPM decided to demobilise their activities and to have the guerrillas reintegrate into society while continuing to promote their communist ideals until such a time when they could once again rise up in revolt. Chin then moved to south Thailand with the remnants of his forces during the latter part of the Emergency due to pressure from the Malayan security forces, which by 1952 totalled over 32,000 regular troops in Malaya, about three-fifths of whom were Europeans from the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.

=== The second insurgency (1968–1989) ===

In 1961, members of the CPM central committee such as Chin Peng, Chen Tien, and Lee An Tung moved to Beijing to seek political advice and guidance from the more experienced Chinese Communist Party. Chin would, however, remain in Beijing for the next 29 years and the party would not lay down its arms until 1989. The reasons for this reversal of the party&#x27;s decision to disband, according to Chin, was the advice given to him by the Vietnamese communist leaders in Hanoi, the opening of the second &#x27;Vietnam War&#x27;, which was followed by China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, all of which stressed a strong militant line to be taken by Asian communist parties.

While in Beijing, Chin Peng was also advised by Deng Xiaoping, to continue the armed struggle in Malaya as Deng felt the time was ripe for revolutions to take place in Southeast Asia. Deng insisted that the military struggle should not only be maintained but stepped up. Deng even promised financial support to the CPM if they should take up arms once again. Deng offered for this to remain a secret as the CCP did not wish to let it be known that they had been actively supporting Southeast Asia&#x27;s communist movements. Chin reluctantly accepted Deng&#x27;s suggestion. This was also the first time that the CPM had accepted foreign assistance in its struggle and it was with this financial backing that the second armed struggle in Malaya would be launched in 1968.

Meanwhile, back in Malaya, the Malayan government had declared the Emergency over on 31 July 1960 once they became confident the MNLA had ceased to be a credible threat, with the surviving guerrillas retreating to their sanctuary in southern Thailand. However, the insurgency continued with the insurgents increasing their attacks, ambushing military convoys, bombing national monuments, and assassinations of marked police officers and political &#x27;enemy targets&#x27;. The insurgency, which began as a war against the British colonialists, was now transformed into a war against &#x27;federalists, compressors capitalists and lackeys of British imperialism&#x27;. The Malayan government maintained a high-security alert by devoting one-third of its national budget to defence and internal security needs and requested British, Australian and New Zealand troops to remain in the country until its internal security and national armed forces could be built up and the foreign troops gradually phased out.

In 1970, the CPM&#x27;s guerrilla bases in Thailand were hard hit by the trials and executions of suspected spies. Two breakaway factions were formed which condemned the purge. Chin, who was then based in China, denied involvement and later rehabilitated his accused comrades. During the 1970s and 1980s, the CPM intensified its activities and clashes with the security forces. These activities were due to a rivalry among three factions in the CPM over party purges and strategies, with each faction trying to outdo the other in militancy and violence.

However, in 1980, Deng Xiaoping refocused his priorities back on the Chinese bureaucracy after his return to power in 1978. He welcomed Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew and its leading political figure since independence from Malaysia, in a visit to Beijing. Chin recalled that Deng had not bothered to meet him since then. Finally, in December 1980, Deng summoned Chin. In the meeting, Deng demanded Chin to immediately close down all the CPM&#x27;s radio stations which were broadcasting from China to Malaysia. When Chin asked Deng when he would like him to cease the broadcasting, Deng replied, &quot;The sooner the better ... Lee (Lee Kuan Yew) asked me to stop the broadcasts immediately.&quot; Moreover, during his official visit to China, the second prime minister of Malaysia Abdul Razak Hussein held talks with Chinese communist leader Chairman Mao Zedong and urged him to stop giving aid to the CPM. The fourth prime minister Mahathir Mohamad further succeeded in persuading China to downgrade its ties with the CPM. This was an important factor that contributed to the CPM&#x27;s decision to end its armed struggle.

=== Peace process, 1989 ===
The CPM finally laid down its arms in 1989. The death toll during the armed conflict totalled thousands. Those sympathetic to Chin Peng tend to portray the violence perpetrated by the CPM as defensive, while right-wing opponents tend to portray it as aggressive and unethical. Some have claimed a large number of civilian casualties was in contrast to the stance adopted by Mao Zedong and his policy of the Eight Points of Attention.

On 2 December 1989, at the town of Hat Yai in Southern Thailand, Chin, Rashid Maidin, and Abdullah CD met with representatives of the Malaysian and Thai governments. Separate peace agreements were signed between the MCP and both governments. One of the terms of the agreement was that MCP members of Malayan origin be allowed to return to live in Malaysia.

When all hostilities ceased, the total number of CPM members was 1,188; 694 were Thai-born and 494 claimed origins in Peninsular Malaysia. They were given a temporary grant and promised integration into Malaysia.

In Chin&#x27;s opinion, peace could have been achieved as early as 1955 during the Baling Talks, if the British, Tunku Abdul Rahman and David Marshall had not demanded that the communist fighters capitulate and surrender but, rather, had allowed them to hand over or destroy their weapons in a mutually agreed way and then resume normal life with full political freedom, which was the broad outcome of the 1989 accords.

== Final years ==

=== Application to return to Malaysia ===
Chin was not permitted to return to Malaysia after the 1989 Hat Yai Peace Accords and continued his exile in Thailand. He did visit neighbouring Singapore, where he gave lectures at the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2004, using purposes of academic research as his reason to gain visitation permission from the Singaporean government. At the beginning of 2000, he applied for permission to return to Malaysia. His application was rejected by the high court on 25 July 2005.

In June 2008, Chin again lost his bid to return to Malaysia when the Court of Appeal upheld an earlier ruling that compelled him to show identification papers to prove his citizenship. Chin maintained that his birth certificate was seized by the police during a raid in 1948. His counsel Raja Aziz Addruse had submitted before the Court of Appeal that it was wrong for the Malaysian government to compel him to produce the documents because he was entitled to enter and live in Malaysia under the peace agreement.

In April 2009, Chin&#x27;s application to return to Malaysia was once again rejected by the High Court for the same reason as his previous attempt. The Malaysian government insisted that his possible return would cause people who lost their loved ones during the Emergency to relive their pain again.

In November 2009, Chin issued an apology to the victims and their family members for the atrocities committed by the CPM. However, the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Muhyiddin Yassin, replied that despite Chin&#x27;s apology, he would still not be allowed to return to Malaysia due to his treason.

=== Death ===

Chin died of cancer at the age of 88 at a private hospital in Bangkok, with only his 50-year-old niece by his side, on the morning of 16 September 2013, the 50th anniversary of the establishment of Malaysia.

While Chin had previously voiced his desire to be buried in Sitiawan, his remains continued to be denied entry for burial in Malaysia by the Malaysian government, as it was claimed that the one-year window after the agreement to reapply for citizenship had long lapsed and Chin was assumed to have relinquished his rights to return. In November 2019, his remains were announced to have been returned in secrecy by a small action committee on 16 September 2019; his ashes were ceremoniously transported through Sitiawan before scattering at a hillside near Chemor and at sea.

== Publications ==

Chin Peng co-authored his story with Singapore-based writers and publishers Ian Ward, who was formerly the Southeast Asia correspondent for the London conservative newspaper, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, and Ward&#x27;s wife Norma Miraflor. The book named &quot;Alias Chin Peng: My Side of History&quot;, was published in 2003.

Another book, &quot;Dialogues with Chin Peng: New Light on the Malayan Communist Party&quot; by editors C. C. Chin and Karl Hack, was published by the Singapore University Press in 2004. This book details a series of meetings held in Australia that Chin Peng had attended with historians and military experts.

== Media portrayal ==
In 2006, a documentary film about Chin Peng was made called &quot;The Last Communist&quot;. It was banned by the Ministry of Home Affairs of Malaysia. In 2015, another documentary film about him called &quot;I Love Malaya&quot; was released.

<text>The Walschaerts valve gear is a type of valve gear used to regulate the flow of steam to the pistons in steam locomotives, invented by Belgian railway engineer Egide Walschaerts in 1844.
 The gear is sometimes named without the final &quot;s&quot;, since it was incorrectly patented under that name. It was extensively used in steam locomotives from the late 19th century until the end of the steam era.

==History==

The Walschaerts valve gear was slow to gain popularity. The Stephenson valve gear remained the most commonly used valve gear on 19th-century locomotives. However, the Walschaerts valve gear had the advantage that it could be mounted entirely on the outside of the locomotives, leaving the space between the frames clear and allowing easy access for service and adjustment, which resulted in it being adopted in some articulated locomotives.

The first locomotive fitted with the Walschaerts valve gear was built in 1849 at the Belgian Tubize workshops. 

Egide Walschaerts was awarded a gold medal, honorable mentions and a diploma at the 1878 Universal Exhibition in Paris, and also in Antwerp in 1883.

In 1874, New Zealand Railways ordered two NZR B class locomotives. They were Double Fairlie locomotives, supplied by Avonside; the first use in New Zealand of Walschaerts valve gear and probably the first time that a British manufacturer had supplied it. They were Cape gauge. 
The Mason Bogie, a modified Fairlie locomotive of 1874, was the first to use the Walschaerts gear in North America.

The first application in Britain was on a Single Fairlie 0-4-4T, exhibited in Paris in 1878 and purchased by the Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway in March 1882. According to Ernest Ahrons, the locomotive saw very little service as nobody seems to have known how to set the valves and this led to enormous coal consumption.

In the 20th century, the Walschaerts valve gear was the most commonly used type, especially on larger locomotives. In Europe, its use was almost universal, whilst in North America, the Walschaerts gear outnumbered its closest competitor, the derived Baker valve gear, by a wide margin.

In Germany and some neighbouring countries, like Poland and Czechoslovakia, the Walschaerts gear is generally named the Heusinger valve gear after Edmund Heusinger von Waldegg, who invented the mechanism independently in 1849. Heusinger&#x27;s gear was closer to the form generally adopted, but most authorities accept Walschaerts&#x27; invention as sufficiently close to the final form.

==Purpose==

The Walschaerts valve gear is an improvement on the earlier Stephenson valve gear in that it enables the driver to operate the steam engine in a continuous range of settings from maximum economy to maximum power. At any setting, the valve gear satisfies the following two conditions:

* The valve opens to admit steam to the cylinder just before the start of a piston stroke. The pressure of this steam provides the driving force.
* Soon before the space on one side of the piston starts to contract, the valve starts to release steam from that space to the atmosphere, so as not to impede the movement of the piston.

In an economical setting, steam is admitted to the expanding space for only part of the stroke; at a point set by the driver, the intake is cut off. Since the exhaust is also shut, during the rest of the stroke the steam that has entered the cylinder expands in isolation, and so its pressure decreases. Thus, the most energy available from the steam (in the absence of a condenser) is used.

The Walschaerts valve gear enables the engine driver to change the cutoff point without changing the points at which intake starts.

Economy also requires that the throttle be wide open and that the boiler pressure is at the maximum safe level to maximise thermal efficiency. For economy, a steam engine is used of a size such that the most economical settings yield the right amount of power most of the time, such as when a train is running at steady speed on level track.

When greater power is necessary, e.g. when gaining speed when pulling out of a station and when ascending a gradient, the Walschaerts valve gear enables the engine driver to set the cutoff point near the end of the stroke, so that the full pressure of the boiler is exerted on the piston for almost the entire stroke. With such a setting, when the exhaust opens, the steam in the cylinder is near full boiler pressure. The pressure in the steam at that moment serves no useful purpose; it drives a sudden pulse of pressure into the atmosphere and is wasted .

This sudden pulse of pressure causes the loud puffing sound that members of the public associate with steam engines, because they mostly encounter engines at stations, where efficiency is sacrificed as trains pull away. A steam engine well adjusted for efficiency makes a soft hissing sound that lasts throughout the exhaust stroke, with the sounds from the two cylinders overlapping to produce a nearly constant sound.

==Motion==

The valve gear operation combines two motions; one is the primary lead motion which is imparted at the bottom of the combination lever (12). The secondary is the directional/amplitude motion which is imparted at the top. 
Consider that the driver has adjusted the reversing lever such that the die block is at mid-gear. In this position the secondary motion is eliminated and the piston valve travel is shortest, giving minimal injection and exhaust of steam. The travel of the piston valve is twice the total of lap plus lead.


Contrast this to when the die block is at the bottom of the expansion link (7), giving maximum steam injection and exhaust. This is the most powerful forward setting and is used in accelerating forward from rest. Conversely when the die block is at the top of the expansion link (7), maximal power in reverse is obtained. (On some engines the die block was in the top of the link in forward gear. This type was generally used on tank engines, which worked in forward and reverse equally.)

Once the locomotive has accelerated the driver can adjust the reverser toward the mid-gear position, decreasing cut-off to give a more economical use of steam. The engine&#x27;s tractive effort is then less than it was at starting, but its power is greater.

==Technical details==


The primary lead motion is provided by the crosshead arm (9) and the union link (11). This pivoting bar gives the in phase component of motion to the bottom of the combination lever (12).

The secondary directional/amplitude motion is derived from a mechanical linkage made up of several components.

The eccentric crank (UK: return crank) (1) is rigidly attached to the con-rod pin connected to the main drive wheel. Note that this is the only suitable attachment point on any of the drive wheels that is not fouled by the passage of the coupling rod or the connecting rod. The eccentric crank is of a length such that the pin attachment to the eccentric rod (2) is 90 degrees out of phase with the lead motion.

The eccentric rod provides motion to the expansion link (7) which is pivoted in a central location back to the body of the locomotive. The expansion link holds the radius bar (8), captive by a die block which is integral with the radius bar but is free to move vertically in a constrained curved path along the expansion link.

The vertical position of the radius bar is controlled in the cab by the driver adjusting the reverser which in turn controls the mechanical linkage; reach rod (3), lifting link (4), lifting arm (5) and reverse arm and shaft (6).

In this way the secondary, out of phase, driver controlled component of motion is imparted to the top of the combination lever (12) by the radius bar (8).

The combination lever combines these two motions with the resultant acting upon the valve stem (13), suitably restrained by the valve stem guide (10), which in turn acts upon the piston valve (14).
===Inside and outside admission valves===
The Walschaerts gear can be linked to inside or outside admission valves. This article has only considered inside-admission piston valves until now, but outside-admission valves (slide valves and some piston valves) can use Walschaerts valve gear. If the valves have outside admission the radius bar connects to the combination lever below the valve stem rather than above and the orientation of the eccentric crank is changed so that it leads, rather than trails, the main crank pin.

===Layout===

To lay out Walschaerts gear, the proportions of the combination lever must be chosen. A displacement of the union link end by half the piston travel must cause a valve rod displacement of the valve lead plus the valve lap. The ratio of distance from union link end to pivot with radius rod to the distance between the valve rod end to the pivot with the radius rod should be in the same proportion as half piston travel to valve lap plus lead.

When the piston is at either dead centre movement of the radius rod should not move the valve rod. Therefore the expansion link die slot should be an arc of a circle of radius equal to the length of the radius rod. 

The throw of the return crank must give the required oscillation of the expansion link.

==Variants==
There have been many variants of Walschaerts valve gear, including:

* Baker valve gear
* Baguley valve gear
* Bagnall–Price valve gear
* J. T. Marshall valve gear
* Kuhn slide

<doc id="1244909" wikidata="Q6775928" url="?curid=1244909" title="Martin Kramer">
<text>Martin Seth Kramer (; born September 9, 1954, Washington, D.C.) is an American-Israeli academic with a focus on the Middle East at Tel Aviv University and the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. His focus is on the history and politics of the Middle East, contemporary Islam, and modern Israel.

Kramer has written for the Islamophobic group Middle East Forum, and has argued that Islam and fundamentalism are innately linked.

==Education==
Kramer began his undergraduate degree under Itamar Rabinovich in Middle Eastern Studies at Tel Aviv University and completed his BA in Near Eastern Studies from Princeton University. He earned his PhD at Princeton as well, under Fouad Ajami, L. Carl Brown, Charles Issawi, and Bernard Lewis, who directed his thesis. He also received a History MA from Columbia University. He gained a PhD in Near Eastern Studies from Princeton University in 1982.

==Career==

Kramer is a senior and past editor of the Middle East Forum&#x27;s Middle East Quarterly. Primarily a scholar of twentieth century Islamist intellectual and political history, Kramer has also published columns in the National Review magazine and on the websites of the History News Network.

==Political involvement==
Kramer was an early advocate of attacking Saddam Hussein in the wake of 9/11, arguing in December 2001 that regardless of a possible involvement, he posed a threat to the entire Middle East. However, he was critical of the shifting rationale for the war in October 2002, questioning the United States&#x27; &quot;tools of social engineering&quot; needed to promote an eventual democracy process in the Arab world.

He was a senior policy adviser on the Middle East to the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Campaign in 2007.

== Critique of Middle Eastern studies ==

=== &quot;Ivory Towers on Sand&quot; ===
In 2001, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy published Kramer&#x27;s book &quot;Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America&quot;. In the book (as reported by the &quot;New York Times&quot;), Kramer argued that Middle East experts &quot;failed to ask the right questions at the right time about Islam. They underestimated its impact in the 1980s; they misrepresented its role in the early 1990s; and they glossed over its growing potential for terrorism against America in the late 1990s.&quot;The book was given positive mentions in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Washington Post

John L. Esposito accused Kramer of trying to discredit the entire Middle East establishment. Zachary Lockman, professor of modern Middle East history at New York University, admits that Kramer&#x27;s criticism of Middle East scholars&#x27; general failure to anticipate the rise of Islamist movements in the 1970s is well-deserved but maintains that &quot;[o]verall, Kramer’s approach is deeply flawed as a history of Middle East studies as a scholarly field.&quot;

=== HR 3077 ===

Kramer was one of the most vocal supporters of HR 3077, a bill in the United States House of Representatives designed to reform area studies in the US. Saree Makdisi argues in a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; op-ed that the bill &quot;poses a profound threat to academic freedom&quot;.

==Palestinian population growth controversy==
At the February 2010 Herzliya Conference in Israel, Kramer caused controversy by advocating for the elimination of Western aid in what he termed &quot;pro-natal subsidies&quot; to Palestinian refugees in Gaza in order to discourage population growth and Islamic radicalization:

At the time, he was a National Security Studies Program Visiting Scholar at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard University, and some critics called on Harvard to distance itself from him. Deans at Harvard University&#x27;s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs rejected these calls, stating, &quot;Accusations have been made that Martin Kramer&#x27;s statements are genocidal. These accusations are baseless.&quot; They found that Kramer&#x27;s critics &quot;appear not to understand the role of controversy in an academic setting&quot; and rejected any attempts to restrict &quot;fundamental academic freedom.&quot; Kramer later referred to the speech as &quot;experimental&quot; and deliberately &quot;provocative.&quot;

<text>Paulette Bourgeois, (born July 20, 1951) is a Canadian writer best known for creating Franklin the Turtle, the character who appears in picture books illustrated by Toronto native Brenda Clark. The books have sold more than 60 million copies worldwide and have been translated into 38 languages. An animated television series, merchandise, DVDs and full-length films are based on the character.

==Education and early career==
Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Bourgeois graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Occupational therapy from the University of Western Ontario in 1974. She was a psychiatric occupational therapist for three years before deciding to focus on her writing. She studied journalism at Carleton University then worked as a reporter for the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; and CBC Television. She became a freelance journalist in Washington, D.C. contributing pieces to &quot;Chatelaine&quot;, &quot;Canadian Living&quot;, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;. She returned to Toronto in 1983. Bourgeois graduated with an MFA in creative writing from the University of British Columbia in 2009.

==Franklin==
After the birth of her first child, Natalie, she decided to write a children&#x27;s book inspired by the Season 7 episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; entitled C*A*V*E, where Hawkeye Pierce admits that he is claustrophobic and refuses to go into a cave, &quot;If I were a turtle I would be afraid of my own shell&quot;, he explained. &quot;Franklin in the Dark&quot; was illustrated by Brenda Clark and published in 1986.

She is also the author of &quot;Changes in You and Me&quot;, books about adolescence, the &quot;Oma&#x27;s Quilt&quot; was developed as a short film by the National Film Board of Canada, &quot;Big Sarah&#x27;s Little Boots&quot; and more. Paulette has also written dozens of non-fiction books for children, including the Amazing series, the &quot;In My Neighbourhood&quot; series, &quot;The Sun&quot;, and &quot;The Moon&quot;. She has been a columnist for Homemaker&#x27;s Magazine, written for Canadian Living, Chatelaine and Today&#x27;s Parent. She provided the concept and initial research for &quot;The Bee Talker&quot; which aired on CBC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Nature of Things&quot;. She has written three episodes of the TV documentary series, Creepy Canada, and has just finished the script for a full-length feature film, &quot;Loving Mrs. Twiggy&quot;. 

The Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists asked Bourgeois to write a picture book explaining the work of occupational therapists. &quot;You, Me and My OT&quot; was published in 2009. It tells the story of Emma, a feisty young girl with cerebral palsy who participates in everyday classroom occupations. 

She has two grown-up children, Natalie and Gordon and lives in Toronto, Ontario.

==Honours==
In 2003, she became a Member of the Order of Canada and in 2007, she received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from her alma mater, the University of Western Ontario, and an Award of Merit from the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists.
