<text>Tannu Uriankhai (, ; , ; ) was a historical region of the Mongol Empire, its principal successor, the Yuan dynasty, and later the Qing dynasty. The territory of Tannu Uriankhai largely corresponds to the modern-day Tuva Republic of the Russian Federation, neighboring areas in Russia, and a small part of the modern state of Mongolia.

&quot;Tannu&quot; designates the Tannu-ola Mountains in the region, and &quot;Uriankhai&quot; was the Mongolian name for the Tuvans (and accordingly their realm), which meant &quot;the people living in the woods&quot; ().

After Mongolia (Outer Mongolia) declared independence from the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China in the early 20th century, the region of Tannu Uriankhai increasingly came under Russian influence and finally became an independent communist state, the Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic, which was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1944.

Sovereignty over the area has not been officially renounced by the Republic of China since 1949. However, the Mainland Affairs Council issued a statement saying that &quot;Outer Mongolia has never been part of its constitutionally claimed territory.&quot;

The 2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship states that the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), which controls Mainland China, and the Russian Federation, which controls Tuva, &quot;have no remaining territorial claims&quot;. The PRC has official contacts with Tuva and regards it as part of Russia.

== History ==
With the fall of the Yuan dynasty in China, Tannu Uriankhai was controlled by the Oirats (western Mongols, also known as Zungars) until the end of the 16th and early 17th centuries. Thereafter, the history of western Mongolia, and by extension Tannu Uriankhai, is centred around the complex military relations between the Altan Khanate (Khotogoit tribe) and the Oirots, both competing for supremacy in western Mongolia.

The Qing dynasty established its dominion over Mongolia as a result of intervening in a war between the Oirots and the Khalkhas, the dominant tribe in the eastern half of Mongolia. In 1691 the Kangxi Emperor accepted the submission of the Khalkhas at Dolon Nor in Inner Mongolia, and then personally led an army into Mongolia, defeating the Oirots near Ulaanbaatar (the capital of present-day Mongolia) in 1696. Mongolia was now part of the Qing state, and the dynasty&#x27;s rule over Tuva came not by conquest but by threat: In 1726 the Yongzheng Emperor ordered the Khotogoit Khan Buuvei Beise to accompany a high-ranking Qing official to &quot;inform the Uriankhais of [Qing] edicts&quot; in order to prevent &quot;something untoward from happening&quot;.

==Qing administration==

The Tannu Uriankhai were reorganized into an administrative system similar to that of Mongolia, with five banners (khoshun, 旗) and 46 or 47 arrows (sum, 佐領); Chinese and Russian sources differ on the number of khoshuns and sums. Each khoshun was governed by a magistrate (not hereditary) nominally appointed by the Qing military governor at Uliastai. In the latter half of the 18th century, the magistrate of Tannu Banner was placed in charge of the others as governor (&quot;amban-noyon&quot;, 四旗總管) in recognition of his military service to the dynasty, until 1872.

Tannu Uriankhai, as well as Altai and Altainor Uriankhai, occupied a unique position in the Qing dynasty&#x27;s frontier administration system. If Qing statutes rigorously defined procedures to be followed by the nobles of Outer and Inner Mongolia, Zungaria, and Qinghai for rendering tribute, receiving government stipends, and participating in imperial audiences, they were silent regarding Tannu Uriankhai. After the demarcation of the Sino-Russian border by the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727), the Qing inexplicably placed border guards (&quot;yurt pickets&quot;, Mongolian: &quot;ger kharuul&quot;) south of the Tannu-ola Mountains separating Tannu Uriankai from Outer Mongolia, not along the Sayan Mountains separating the region from Russia. This act was used by 19th-century Russian polemicists, and later Soviet writers, to prove that Tuva had historically been &quot;disputed&quot; territory between Russia and China. The Qing military governor at Uliastiai, on his triennial inspection tours of the 24 pickets under his direct supervision, never crossed the Tannu-ola mountains to visit Uriankhai. When problems occurred meriting official attention, the military governor sent a Mongol from his staff rather than attend to the matter himself.

There is no evidence that Tannu Uriankhai was ever visited by a senior Qing official (except perhaps in 1726). Chinese merchants were forbidden to cross the pickets, a law enforced until the turn of the 20th century. Instead, a few days were set aside for trade at Uliastai when Uriankhai nobles delivered their annual fur tribute to the military governor and received their salaries and other imperial gifts (primarily bolts of satin and cotton cloth) from the emperor. Thus, Tannu Uriankhai enjoyed a degree of political and cultural autonomy unequalled on the Chinese frontier.

==Russian settlement==
Russian settlement of the region began in 1839 with the opening of two gold mines in the Sayan Mountains; in the following decades, other areas were exploited for mining, mainly in the northern part of Uriankhai. By 1883 the total number of Russian miners there reached 485.

Russian merchants from Minusinsk followed, especially after the Treaty of Peking in 1860, which opened China to foreign trade. They were lured by the &quot;wild prices&quot;, as one 19th-century Russian writer described them, that Uriankhais were willing to pay for Russian manufactured goods—cloth, haberdashery, samovars, knives, tobacco, etc. By the end of the 1860s there were sixteen commercial &quot;establishments&quot; (&quot;zavedenie&quot;) in Tannu Uriankhai. The Uriankhais paid for these goods in livestock-on-the-hoof, furs, and animal skins (sheep, goat, horse, and cattle). But crossing the Sayan Mountains was treacherous; by 1880–85 there were perhaps no more than 50 (or fewer) Russian traders operating in Tannu Uriankhai during the summer, when trade was most active.

Russian colonization followed in 1856 with a sect of Old Believers called the &quot;Seekers of White Waters&quot;, seeking a place, which according to their tradition was isolated from the rest of the world by impassable mountains and forests, provided refuge from government authorities, and where the Nikon rites of the Russian Orthodox Church were not practiced.

The formal beginning of Russian colonization in Tannu Uriankhai occurred in 1885 when a merchant received permission from the governor-general of Irkutsk to farm in present-day Turan. Other settlements were formed, and by the first decade of the 20th century there were perhaps 2,000 merchants and colonists.

By the late 1870s and in the 1880s the Russian presence had acquired a political content. In 1878 Russians discovered gold in eastern Uriankhai. There were rumors of fabulous wealth to be gained from this area, and the Russian provincial authorities at Yeniseisk were inundated with petitions from gold miners to mine, and permission to do was granted. Merchants and miners petitioned Russian authorities for military and police protection. In 1886 the Usinsk Frontier Superintendent was established; its primary function was to represent Russian interests in Tannu-Uriankhai with Uriankhai nobles (not Qing officials) and to issue passports to Russians traveling in the area. Over the years the office quietly but steadily claimed the power of government over at least the Russians in the region—taxation, policing, administration, and justice—powers that should have belonged to but were effectively relinquished by the Qing. Shortly after the office of Superintendent was created, the &quot;Sibirskaya gazeta&quot; brought out a special edition, congratulating the government on its creation, and predicting that all Tannu Uriankhai would someday become part of the Russian state.

==Qing reaction==

The Qing government was not oblivious to the Russian presence. In the 1860s and 1870s the Uliastai military governor on a number of occasions reported to Peking on the movement of Russians into Uriankhai. Its suspicions were further aroused by other events. At negotiations between it and Russia resulting in the Tarbagatai Protocol of 1864, which defined a part of the Sino-Russian border, the Russian representative insisted that all territory to the north of the Qing frontier pickets fall to Russia. Moreover, the Uliastai military governor obtained a Russian map showing the Tannu-ola Mountains as the Sino-Russian border.

==End of Qing rule==

By the early 20th century, the Uriankhai economy had seriously deteriorated, resulting in its people becoming impoverished. The causes were varied: the declining number of fur-bearing animals likely from over-hunting by both Uriankhais and Russians; the declining number of livestock as a result of the export market to Siberia; and periodic natural disasters (especially droughts and plagues), which were detrimental to livestock herds. Additionally, Uriankhai trade with Russians was conducted on credit using a complex system of valuation principally pegged to squirrel skins. As the number of squirrels declined because of over-hunting, the price of goods increased. The Russians also manipulated the trade by encouraging credit purchases at usurious rates of interest. If repayment were not forthcoming, Russian merchants would drive off the livestock of either the debtor or of his relatives or friends, which led to retaliatory raids by the Uriankhai.

The situation worsened when the Han people arrived from China proper. Although the Qing had successfully kept Han traders out of Uriankhai (unlike in other parts of Outer Mongolia and other parts of the frontier), in 1902 they were allowed to cross the border to counter Russian domination of the Uriankhai economy. By 1910, there were 30 or so shops, all branches of Han-owned firms operating in Uliastai. For many reasons—more aggressive selling, easier credit terms, cheaper and more popular goods for sale—the Han people soon dominated commerce just as they had in Outer Mongolia. Soon, the Uriankhais, commoners and princes alike, had accumulated large debts to the Han.

The end of Qing rule in Tannu Uriankhai came quickly. On October 10, 1911, the Xinhai Revolution broke out, and soon afterwards Chinese provinces followed one another in declaring their independence. Mongolia (Outer Mongolia) declared its own independence from China on December 1, and expelled the Qing viceroy four days later.

Uriankhai nobles were divided on their course of political action. The Uriankhai governor, Gombo-Dorzhu, advocated becoming a protectorate of Russia, hoping that the Russians in turn would appoint him governor of Uriankhai. But the princes of two other banners preferred to submit to the new Bogd Khanate of Mongolia under the theocratic rule of the Jebstundamba Khutukhtu of Urga.

Gombu-Dorzhu sent a petition to the Frontier Superintendent at Usinsk, stating that he had been chosen as leader of an independent Tannu Uriankhai state. He asked for protection and proposed that Russian troops be sent immediately into the state to prevent China from restoring its rule over the region. There was no reply—three months earlier the Tsarist Council of Ministers had already decided on a policy of gradual, cautious absorption of Uriankhai by encouraging Russian colonization; precipitate action by Russia, the Council feared, might provoke China. This position changed as a result of pressure from commercial circles in Russia for a more activist approach, and a Russian sponsored &quot;petition&quot; from two Uriankhai khoshuns in the fall of 1913 requesting to be accepted as a part of Russia. Other Uriankhai khoshuns soon followed suit. In April 1914 Tannu Uriankhai was formally accepted as a protectorate of Russia.

<doc id="1242211" wikidata="Q1356572" url="?curid=1242211" title="Exaptation">
<text>Exaptation or co-option is a shift in the function of a trait during evolution. For example, a trait can evolve because it served one particular function, but subsequently it may come to serve another. Exaptations are common in both anatomy and behaviour.

Bird feathers are a classic example. Initially they may have evolved for temperature regulation, but later were adapted for flight. When feathers were first used to aid in flight, that was an exaptive use. They have since then been shaped by natural selection to improve flight, so in their current state they are best regarded as adaptations for flight. So it is with many structures that initially took on a function as an exaptation: once molded for a new function, they become further adapted for that function.

Interest in exaptation relates to both the process and products of evolution: the process that creates complex traits and the products (functions, anatomical structures, biochemicals, etc.) that may be imperfectly developed. The term &quot;exaptation&quot; was proposed by Stephen Jay Gould and Elisabeth Vrba as a replacement for &quot;pre-adaptation&quot;, which they considered to be a teleologically loaded term (i.e., it falsely implies that adaptation, or evolution generally, acts in pursuit of some goal).

==History and definitions==

The idea that the function of a trait might shift during its evolutionary history originated with Charles Darwin (). For many years the phenomenon was labeled &quot;preadaptation&quot;, but since this term suggests teleology in biology, appearing to conflict with natural selection, it has been replaced by the term &quot;exaptation&quot;.

The idea had been explored by several scholars when in 1982 Stephen Jay Gould and Elisabeth Vrba introduced the term &quot;exaptation&quot;. However, this definition had two categories with different implications for the role of adaptation.
(1) A character, previously shaped by natural selection for a particular function (an adaptation), is coopted for a new use—cooptation.
(2) A character whose origin cannot be ascribed to the direct action of natural selection (a nonaptation), is coopted for a current use—cooptation. (Gould and Vrba 1982, Table 1)
The definitions are silent as to whether exaptations had been shaped by natural selection after cooption, although Gould and Vrba cite examples (e.g., feathers) of traits shaped after cooption. Note that the selection pressure upon a trait is likely to change if it is (especially, primarily or solely) used for a new purpose, potentially initiating a different evolutionary trajectory.

To avoid these ambiguities, David Buss et al. suggested the term &quot;co-opted adaptation&quot;, which is limited to traits that evolved after cooption. However, the commonly used terms of &quot;exaptation&quot; and &quot;cooption&quot; are ambiguous in this regard.

==Preadaptation ==
In some circumstances, the &quot;pre-&quot; in preadaptation can be interpreted as applying, for non-teleological reasons, prior to the adaptation itself, creating a meaning for the term that is distinct from exaptation. For example, future environments (say, hotter or drier ones), may resemble those already encountered by a population at one of its current spatial or temporal margins. This is not actual foresight, but rather the luck of having adapted to a climate which later becomes more prominent. Cryptic genetic variation may have the most strongly deleterious mutations purged from it, leaving an increased chance of useful adaptations, but this represents selection acting on current genomes with consequences for the future, rather than foresight.

Function may not always come before form: developed structures could change or alter the primary functions they were intended for due to some structural or historical cause.

==Examples==

Exaptations include the co-option of feathers, which initially evolved for heat regulation, for display, and later for use in bird flight. Another example is the lungs of many basal fish, which evolved into the lungs of terrestrial vertebrates but also underwent exaptation to become the gas bladder, a buoyancy control organ, in derived fish. A third is the repurposing of two of the three bones in the amniote jaw to become the malleus and incus of the mammalian ear, leaving the mammalian jaw with just one hinge.

Arthropods provide the earliest identifiable fossils of land animals, from about in the Late Silurian, and terrestrial tracks from about appear to have been made by arthropods. Arthropods were well pre-adapted to colonize land, because their existing jointed exoskeletons provided support against gravity and mechanical components that could interact to provide levers, columns and other means of locomotion that did not depend on submergence in water.

Metabolism can be considered an important part of exaptation. As one of the oldest biological systems and being central to life on the Earth, studies have shown that metabolism may be able to use exaptation in order to increase fitness, given some new set of conditions or environment. Studies have shown that up to 44 carbon sources are viable for metabolism to successfully take place and that any one adaptation in these specific metabolic systems is due to multiple exaptations. Taking this perspective, exaptations are important in the origination of adaptations in general. A recent example comes from Richard Lenski&#x27;s &quot;E. coli&quot; long-term evolution experiment, in which aerobic growth on citrate arose in one of twelve populations after 31,000 generations of evolution. Genomic analysis by Blount and colleagues showed that this novel trait was due to a gene duplication that caused a citrate transporter that is normally expressed only under anoxic conditions to be expressed under oxic conditions, thus exapting it for aerobic use.

Gould and Brosius took the concept of exaptation to the genetic level. It is possible to look at a retroposon, originally thought to be simply junk DNA, and deduce that it may have gained a new function to be termed as an exaptation. Given an emergency situation in the past, a species may have co-opted junk DNA for a useful purpose. This may have occurred with mammalian ancestors when confronted with the Permian–Triassic extinction event about 250 million years ago and substantial increase in the level of oxygen in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. More than 100 loci have been found to be conserved only among mammalian genomes and are thought to have essential roles in the generation of features such as the placenta, diaphragm, mammary glands, neocortex, and auditory ossicles. It is believed that as a result of exaptation, or making previously &quot;useless&quot; DNA into DNA that could be used in order to increase survival chance, mammals were able to generate new brain structures as well as behavior to better survive the mass extinction and adapt to new environments. Similarly, viruses and their components have been repeatedly exapted for host functions. The functions of exapted viruses typically involve either defense from other viruses or cellular competitors or transfer of nucleic acids between cells, or storage functions. Koonin and Krupovic suggested that virus exaptation can reach different depths, from recruitment of a fully functional virus to exploitation of defective, partially degraded viruses, to utilization of individual virus proteins.

==Adaptation and exaptation cycle==
It was speculated by Gould and Vrba in one of the first papers written about exaptation, that when an exaptation arises, it may not be perfectly suited for its new role and may therefore evolve new adaptations to promote its use in a better manner. In other words, the beginning of evolving a particular trait starts out with a primary adaptation toward a fit or specific role, followed by a primary exaptation (a new role is derived using the existing feature but may not be perfect for it), which in turn leads to the evolution of a secondary adaptation (the feature is improved by natural selection for better performance), promoting further evolution of an exaptation, and so forth.

Once again, feathers are an important example, in that they may have first been adapted for thermoregulation and with time became useful for catching insects, and therefore served as a new feature for another benefit. For instance, large contour feathers with specific arrangements arose as an adaptation for catching insects more successfully, which eventually led to flight, since the larger feathers served better for that purpose.

==Implications==
===Evolution of complex traits===
One of the challenges to Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution was explaining how complex structures could evolve gradually, given that their incipient forms may have been inadequate to serve any function. As George Jackson Mivart (a critic of Darwin) pointed out, 5 percent of a bird wing would not be functional. The incipient form of complex traits would not have survived long enough to evolve to a useful form.

As Darwin elaborated in the last edition of &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, many complex traits evolved from earlier traits that had served different functions. By trapping air, primitive wings would have enabled birds to efficiently regulate their temperature, in part, by lifting up their feathers when too warm. Individual animals with more of this functionality would more successfully survive and reproduce, resulting in the proliferation and intensification of the trait.

Eventually, feathers became sufficiently large to enable some individuals to glide. These individuals would in turn more successfully survive and reproduce, resulting in the spread of this trait because it served a second and still more beneficial function: that of locomotion. Hence, the evolution of bird wings can be explained by a shifting in function from the regulation of temperature to flight.

===Jury-rigged design===
Darwin explained how the traits of living organisms are well-designed for their environment, but he also recognized that many traits are imperfectly designed. They appear to have been made from available material, that is, jury-rigged. Understanding exaptations may suggest hypotheses regarding subtleties in the adaptation. For instance, that feathers evolved initially for thermal regulation may help to explain some of their features unrelated to flight. However, this is readily explained by the fact that they serve a dual purpose.

Some of the chemical pathways for physical pain and pain from social exclusion overlap. The physical pain system may have been co-opted to motivate social animals to respond to threats to their inclusion in the group.

===Evolution of technology===

Exaptation has received increasing attention in innovation and management studies inspired by evolutionary dynamics, where it has been proposed as a mechanism that drives the serendipitous expansion of technologies and products in new domains.

=== In the cognitive science of religion ===
In the cognitive science of religion, exaptation is used to explain religious behavior and belief. As such, religion is seen as the byproduct of mental evolution.

<text>Leonardsville is a hamlet on the Unadilla River in the Town of Brookfield in Madison County, New York, United States. A portion of it does also extend into the Town of Plainfield in Otsego County, New York, United States.

The community started as a number of small factories deriving power from a dam on the Unadilla River during the first decade of the 19th century. These were known locally as &quot;the shops&quot; and included a scythe and hoe factory, a blacksmith shop, a grist mill, a saw mill, a horse rake factory and wagon shop, and a foundry and machine shop.

As with many small communities, Leonardsville was given its name by the Post Office Department, which in this case named if after Reuben Leonard who, in his early years, ran a local grocery and dry goods business that became a convenient location to drop off mail for local residents.
In 1856, the grist mill, saw mill and agricultural implement factory were destroyed by fire, but were rebuilt immediately. Soon after that, the shops were purchased by the Babcock family who operated them until the 1930s, employing at their peak over 100 workers. Until the 1950s, when the manufacturing shops closed, Leonardsville was a stop on the Unadilla Valley Railway, had a milk station (now a recycling center) and a feed store. None of the manufacturing buildings remain, but the former Crandall Department Store still stands and is now the regionally known Horned Dorset Restaurant.

Leonardsville had its own kindergarten through 12th grade central school until 1969, when the district merged with Bridgewater and West Winfield, creating the Mount Markham Central School district. The building was one of the new district&#x27;s elementary schools until 2001, but now is used for specialized educational programs.

The Wheeler House Complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Population reportedly decreased from 243 in the 2010 census to 110 in 2016, with an average age of 52.

<doc id="1242240" wikidata="Q595010" url="?curid=1242240" title="Hypertrichosis">
<text>Hypertrichosis (better known as Werewolf Syndrome) is an abnormal amount of hair growth over the body. The two distinct types of hypertrichosis are generalized hypertrichosis, which occurs over the entire body, and localized hypertrichosis, which is restricted to a certain area. Hypertrichosis can be either congenital (present at birth) or acquired later in life. The excess growth of hair occurs in areas of the skin with the exception of androgen-dependent hair of the pubic area, face, and axillary regions.

Several circus sideshow performers in the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Julia Pastrana, had hypertrichosis. Many of them worked as freaks and were promoted as having distinct human and animal traits.

== Classification ==
Two methods of classification are used for hypertrichosis. One divides them into either generalized versus localized hypertrichosis, while the other divides them into congenital versus acquired.

=== Congenital ===
Congenital forms of hypertrichosis are caused by genetic mutations, and are extremely rare, unlike acquired forms. Congenital hypertrichosis is always present at birth.

;Hypertrichosis lanuginosa
:Congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa can be noticed at birth, with the infant completely covered in thin lanugo hair. In normal circumstances, lanugo hair is shed before birth and replaced by vellus hair; however, in a person with congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa, the lanugo hair remains after birth. The palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and mucous membranes are not affected. As the person ages, the lanugo hair may thin, leaving only limited areas of hypertrichosis.
;Generalized hypertrichosis
:Congenital generalized hypertrichosis causes males to exhibit excessive facial and upper body hair, whereas women exhibit less severe asymmetrical hair distribution. The palms, soles, and mucous membranes are not affected.
;Terminal hypertrichosis
:Congenital terminal hypertrichosis is characterized by the presence of fully pigmented terminal hair that covers the entire body. This condition is usually accompanied by gingival hyperplasia. This form is most responsible for the term &quot;werewolf syndrome&quot; because of the thick, dark hair that appears. People with this condition are sometimes performers at circuses because of their unusual appearance.
;Circumscribed hypertrichosis
:Congenital circumscribed hypertrichosis is associated with the presence of thick vellus hair on the upper extremities. Circumscribed signifies this type of hypertrichosis is restricted to certain parts of the body, in this case, the extensor surfaces of the upper extremities. Hairy elbow syndrome, a type of congenital circumscribed hypertrichosis, shows excessive growth on and around the elbows. This type of hypertrichosis is present at birth, becomes more prominent during aging, and regresses at puberty.
;Localized hypertrichosis
:Congenital localized hypertrichosis is a localized increase in hair density and length.
;Nevoid hypertrichosis
:Nevoid hypertrichosis may be present at birth or appear later in life. It features an isolated area of excessive terminal hair and is usually not related to any other diseases.

=== Acquired ===
Acquired hypertrichosis appears after birth. The multiple causes include the side effects of drugs, associations with cancer, and possible links with eating disorders. Acquired forms can usually be reduced with various treatments.

;Hypertrichosis lanuginosa
:Acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa is characterized by rapid growth of lanugo hair, particularly on the face. Hair also appears on the trunk and armpits, while palms and soles are unaffected. The excess hair is commonly referred to as malignant down. This hair is very fine and unpigmented.
;Generalized hypertrichosis
:Acquired generalized hypertrichosis commonly affects the cheeks, upper lip, and chin. This form also affects the forearms and legs, but is less common in these areas. Another deformity associated with acquired generalized hypertrichosis is multiple hairs occupying the same follicle. It may also include abnormal hair growth patterns as what happens to the eyelashes in a condition known as trichiasis. Oral minoxidil treatments for hypertension are known to cause this condition. Topical minoxidil used for alopecia causes hair growth in the areas where it is applied; however, this hair disappears shortly after discontinuing the use of topical minoxidil.
;Patterned hypertrichosis
:Acquired patterned hypertrichosis is an increase in hair growth in a pattern formation. It is similar to acquired generalized hypertrichosis and is a sign of internal malignancy.
;Localized hypertrichosis
:Acquired localized hypertrichosis is an increase in hair density and length often secondary to irritation or trauma. This form is restricted to certain areas of the body.

=== Hirsutism ===
Hypertrichosis is often mistakenly classified as hirsutism. Hirsutism is a type of hypertrichosis exclusive to women and children, resulting from an excess of androgen-sensitive hair growth. Patients with hirsutism exhibit patterns of adult male hair growth. Chest and back hair are often present on women with hirsutism.

Hirsutism is both congenital and acquired. It is linked to excessive male hormones in women, thus symptoms may include acne, deepening of the voice, irregular menstrual periods, and the formation of a more masculine body shape. Increases in androgen (male hormone) levels are the primary cause of most hirsutism cases. If caused by increased levels of androgens, it can be treated with medications that reduce androgen levels. Some birth control pills and spironolactone reduce androgen levels.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The primary characteristic of all forms of hypertrichosis is excessive hair. Hair in hypertrichosis is usually longer than expected and may consist of any hair type (lanugo, vellus, or terminal). Patterned forms of hypertrichosis cause hair growth in patterns. Generalized forms of hypertrichosis result in hair growth over the entire body. Circumscribed and localized forms lead to hair growth restricted to a certain area.

== Causes ==

=== Genetic === 
;Hypertrichosis lanuginosa
:Congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa may be caused by a paracentric inversion mutation of the q22 band of chromosome 8; however, it could also possibly be the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation rather than inheritance. This form is an autosomal (not located on the sex chromosomes) dominant cutaneous disorder, that affects the skin.
;Generalized hypertrichosis
:Congenital generalized hypertrichosis has a dominant pattern of inheritance and has been linked to chromosome Xq24-27.1. An affected female (carrying the hypertrichosis gene) has a 50% chance of passing it to her offspring. An affected male will pass this form of hypertrichosis to his daughters, but never the sons.
;Generalized hypertrichosis terminalis
:Congenital generalized hypertrichosis terminalis is thought to be caused by genetic changes on chromosome 17 resulting in the addition or removal of millions of nucleotides. The gene MAP2K6 may be a factor contributing to this condition. This condition may also be due to the change in the chromosome affecting the transcription of genes.
;Other hypertrichosis patterns
:Porphyria cutanea tarda may manifest in some patients as hypertrichosis on the face (mainly on top of the cheeks).

=== Medical conditions ===
Acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa is commonly present with cancer. This condition is also linked to metabolic disorders, such as anorexia, hormone imbalances, such as hyperthyroidism, or as a side effect of certain drugs.

Acquired generalized hypertrichosis may be caused by cancer. The resulting hair growth is known as malignant down. The mechanism behind cancer induced hypertrichosis is unknown. Oral and topical Minoxidil treatments are also known to cause acquired generalized hypertrichosis.

=== Medications ===
Several medications can cause generalized or localized acquired hypertrichosis including:
* Anticonvulsants: Phenytoin
* Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine
* Vasodilators: Diazoxide and Minoxidil
* Antibiotics: Streptomycin
* Diuretics: Acetazolamide
* Photosensitizers: Psoralen

Acquired hypertrichosis is usually reversible once the causative medications are discontinued.

=== Unknown causes ===
The exact genetic mutation that causes congenital circumscribed, localized, and nevoid hypertrichosis is unknown.

== Pathophysiology ==

A number of mechanisms can lead to hypertrichosis. One cause involves areas of the skin that are transforming from the small vellus type to the larger terminal type. This change normally occurs during adolescence, when vellus hair follicles in the underarms and groin grow into terminal hair follicles. Hypertrichosis involves this same type of switching, but in areas that do not normally produce terminal hair. The mechanisms for this switch are poorly understood.

Another mechanism involves a change in the hair cycle. There are three stages of the hair cycle: the anagen phase (hair growth), the catagen phase (hair follicle death), and the telogen phase (hair shedding). If the anagen phase increases beyond what is normal, that region of the body will experience excessive hair growth.

== Diagnosis ==
Hypertrichosis is diagnosed clinically by the occurrence of hair in excess of what is expected for age, sex, and ethnicity in areas that are not androgen-sensitive. The excess can be in the form of excessive length or density and may consist of any hair type (lanugo, vellus, or terminal).

== Management ==
There is no cure for any congenital forms of hypertrichosis. The treatment for acquired hypertrichosis is based on attempting to address the underlying cause. Acquired forms of hypertrichosis have a variety of sources, and are usually treated by removing the factor causing hypertrichosis, e.g. a medication with undesired side-effects. All hypertrichosis, congenital or acquired, can be reduced through hair removal. Hair removal treatments are categorized into two principal subdivisions: temporary removal and permanent removal. Treatment may have adverse effects by causing scarring, dermatitis, or hypersensitivity.

Temporary hair removal may last from several hours to several weeks, depending on the method used. These procedures are purely cosmetic. Depilation methods, such as trimming, shaving, and depilatories, remove hair to the level of the skin and produce results that last several hours to several days. Epilation methods, such as plucking, electrology, waxing, sugaring, threading remove the entire hair from the root, the results lasting several days to several weeks.

Permanent hair removal uses chemicals, energy of various types, or a combination to target the cells that cause hair growth. Laser hair removal is an effective method of hair removal on hairs that have color. The laser targets the melanin in the lower third of the hair follicle. Electrology uses electric current or localized heating. 

, medication to reduce production of hair is being tested. One medicinal option suppresses testosterone by increasing the sex hormone-binding globulin. Another controls the overproduction of hair through the regulation of a luteinizing hormone.

== Epidemiology ==
Congenital forms of hypertrichosis are extremely rare. Only 50 cases of congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa have been recorded since the Middle Ages, and fewer than 100 cases of congenital generalized hypertrichosis have been documented in scientific publications and by the media. Congenital generalized hypertrichosis is isolated to one family in Mexico. Acquired hypertrichosis and hirsutism are more common. For example, hirsutism occurs in about 10% of women between ages 18 and 45.

== Society and culture ==

People with hair often found jobs as circus performers, making the best of their unusual appearance. Fedor Jeftichew (&quot;Jo-Jo the Dog-faced Man&quot;), Stephan Bibrowski (&quot;Lionel the Lion-faced Man&quot;), Jesús &quot;Chuy&quot; Aceves (&quot;Wolfman&quot;), Annie Jones (&quot;the bearded woman&quot;) and Alice Elizabeth Doherty (&quot;The Minnesota Woolly Girl&quot;) all had hypertrichosis. Extensive hypertrichosis carries an emotional burden and can cause cosmetic embarrassment; however, some people attempt no treatments because they say it defines who they are.

=== The Gonsalvus family ===

Petrus Gonsalvus (1537–1618) was referred to by Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi as &quot;the man of the woods&quot;. Four of his seven children were also afflicted with hypertrichosis and painted.

=== Barbara van Beck ===

Barbara van Beck (1629–1668?) is one of the first people to be depicted with Ambras syndrome. She was the only member of her family with the condition. She travelled around Europe, living in court and appearing before the nobility in cities such as London and Paris.

=== The hairy family of Burma ===
One record in history concerning congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa is the hairy family of Burma, a four-generational pedigree of the condition. In 1826, John Crawford was leading a mission for the Governor-General of India through Burma. He tells of meeting a hairy man, Shwe-Maong. Shwe-Maong lived in the court of King Ava and acted as an entertainer. Shwe-Maong had four children: three unaffected children, and one child with congenital hypertrichosis, named Maphoon. On a second mission to Ava, Maphoon was described as a thirty-year-old woman with two sons, one of which had hypertrichosis. The affected son was named Maong-Phoset. He had an affected daughter named Mah-Me. Whereas all affected members of the family had dental problems, the unaffected members had perfect teeth.

=== Julia Pastrana ===

Julia Pastrana (1834–1860) travelled throughout the United States in a freak show as the bearded lady, capturing the attention of many artists. She is portrayed as having dark extensive hairs distributed equally throughout the surface of her body, even on the palms of her hands. Originally, she was believed to have congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa; however, the generalized form of the syndrome coupled with her gingival hyperplasia indicated that her condition was congenital terminal hypertrichosis. This was not confirmed until after her death, when it became clear that her X-linked syndrome resulted in terminal hairs.

=== Supattra Sasupan ===
In 2011, Supattra Sasupan (; born August 5, 2000), an 11-year-old girl from Thailand with hypertrichosis was named the world&#x27;s hairiest girl by the Guinness Book of World Records (as Supatra Sasuphan).

== Etymology ==
Origin of the word hypertrichosis is in Greek roots (&quot;hyper&quot;-, ʽexcessʼ; &quot;trikhos&quot;, hair and -&quot;osis&quot;, ʽformationʼ) and means a disorder that causes excessive hair growth over the body. Medieval sources do not use this term, however prefer &quot;hairy men and women&quot; instead. These men and women are often mistaken for savages, who similarly have excessive hair, but hairy and savage individuals belong to different categories, since savagery is associated with social or religious isolation. Having exceptional strength, they are deemed closer to the animal than to the human plane. On the contrary, hairy men and women with hypertrichosis are not necessarily isolated and they often live in courts as entertainers, together with other monster-like subjects.

== History ==

The first recorded case of hypertrichosis was Petrus Gonsalvus who was born in the Canary Islands. This was documented by Ulisse Aldrovandi and published in his posthumous &quot;Monstrorum Historia cum Paralipomenis historiae omnium animalium&quot; in 1642. He noted that two daughters (including Antonietta Gonsalvus), a son, and a grandchild in Gonsalvus&#x27; family all had hypertrichosis. Altrovandus dubbed them the Ambras family, after Ambras Castle near Innsbruck, where portraits of the family were found. During the next 300 years, about 50 cases were observed. The scientist Rudolf Virchow described a form of hypertrichosis accompanied by gingival hyperplasia in 1873.

In summer 2019, at least 17 Spanish children have developed so-called “werewolf syndrome”, Spain&#x27;s health ministry has said. Instead of being treated with omeprazole, a drug that helps with gastric reflux, they had received a treatment of minoxidil, a medication against hair loss. How the laboratory FarmaQuimica Sur, based in Malaga, made the mistake, is not yet clear. The lab has been closed as a precaution.

== In animals ==
The condition is also sometimes found in cats. A male Persian with the condition named Atchoum achieved a certain level of notice due to the unusual appearance his hypertrichosis gave him, and has been nicknamed &quot;The Werewolf Cat&quot; (not to be confused with Lykoi or werewolf cat).

In 1955, a female Müller&#x27;s Bornean gibbon was obtained from Sarawak that exhibited abnormal hair growth in the facial region. It has been hypothesized that this could be due to facial hypertrichosis.

Hypertrichosis (often mistakenly classified as hirsutism) is a well documented condition in horses with a hormonal disorder of the hypothalamus, called Cushing&#x27;s disease. It is the most common endocrine disease of the middle-aged to older horse, often resulting in fatal laminitis. It can be successfully controlled by medications if diagnosed early.

<text>Dire Dawa (; , &quot;where the Dir hit his spear into the ground&quot; or &quot;The true Dir&quot;, , Harari: ድሬዳዋ, lit. &quot;Plain of Medicine&quot;; ) is a city in eastern Ethiopia near the Somali Region and Oromo border and one of two chartered cities in Ethiopia (the other being Addis Ababa, the capital). Dire Dawa alongside present-day Sitti Zone were a part of the Dire Dawa autonomous region of the Somali Region stipulated in the 1987 Ethiopian Constitution until 1993 when it was split by the federal government into a separately administered chartered city.

It is divided administratively into two woredas, the city proper and the non-urban woredas of Gurgura.

Dire Dawa lies in the eastern part of the nation, on the Dechatu River, at the foot of a ring of cliffs. The western outskirts of the city lie on the Gorro River, a tributary of the Dechatu River. It is located at the latitude and longitude of . The city is an industrial centre, home to several markets and the Dire Dawa Airport.

The projected population for 2015 was 440,000 for the entire chartered city and 277,000 for the city proper, making the latter the seventh largest city in Ethiopia.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The region was already inhabited in Mesolithic times, as revealed by rock paintings and Middle Stone Age artifacts in the cave of Porc-Épic and Laga-Oda only a few kilometers from Dire Dawa. The area surrounding Dire Dawa is believed to have been a settlement of the extinct Harla people.

Historically, the area used to be part of Adal Sultanate during the medieval times. During the 19th century, the region was considered the domain of the Emirate of Harar until Menelik&#x27;s conquest of the kingdom in 1887 and consequently became incorporated into modern Ethiopia from thereon.

=== Foundation (1902–1936) ===

The present-day town of Dire Dawa (327km by rail from Djibouti), however, is of very recent origin. It owes its foundation to a technical problem: when it became impossible to lay the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway via Harar because of the steep access to the town, Emperor Menelik II accepted (in a later dated 5 November 1896) that the first part of the line might finish at a village at the foot of the mountains, which should be named Addis Harar (&quot;New Harrar&quot;). The railway reached this location on 24 December 1902, a date which may be considered the day of Dire Dawa&#x27;s foundation. The new name, however, did not win recognition.

For financial and diplomatic reasons the railway was not continued until 1909 and the final inauguration of the whole line from Djibouti to Addis Ababa-again delayed by the revolution of 1916-only took place on 7 June 1917. During all this time, Dire Dawa was practically the town profited much and became a &quot;boom city&quot;, attracting most of the trade which formerly passed through Harar. By 1902 the Ethiopian government, anticipating the future economic importance of Dire Dawa, had already transferred the customs station for trade with the Red Sea from Gildessa to Dire Dawa.

Dire Dawa developed into two settlements separated by the Dechatu River, which was dry for most of the year and became a torrent only when it rained. The north-western part of the town was planned and constructed very regularly, mostly by the engineers of the railway company. At first, this part of the town mostly housed the employees of the railway company, but it later attracted, besides the French, also Greeks, Armenians, other Europeans and Arabs, who opened shops and hotels and founded some industry as well. In 1909 the French Capuchin Mission settled in Dire Dawa. At that time Dire Dawa looked like a French town. The other part of the town, southeast of the river, concentrated around the market and was inhabited mainly by Ethiopian, Somali and a few Arab traders.

In September 1916 the fleeing troops of Lij Iyasu took hold of the town. Though Lij Iyasu&#x27;s governor there, the Syrian Hasib al-Idlibi, assured their security, 400 Europeans left the town and the rail traffic had to be suspended. After the battle of Maeso, the governmental troops from Addis Ababa re-established a regular administration.

During the 1920s, the south-eastern part of the town also started to develop. Its inhabitants were mostly Gurgura and Oromo, the other Ethiopians playing only a minor role. The population here grew to 3,000, while that of the whole town numbered 20,000. Between the two World Wars, two hospitals were established in Dire Dawa, one by the railway company and another in 1934 by the government. Education on a primary level was provided by a government school, a Catholic mission school and several schools for the different foreign communities in the town (Greek, Italian, Indian).
Dire Dawa&#x27;s first governor was Ato Mersha Nahusenay. Formerly the governor of the strategic village of Gildessa and its environs, Mersha was instrumental in the construction of the first railway and establishment of the railway city. The imperial railway company (Cie) played a key role in the early development of the city, particularly Gezira (aka Kezira), under the authority of the Ethiopian government. The original failed company was reorganized as the joint-government Franco-Ethiopian Railway in 1908 and, after a period of financial negotiation and recapitalization, construction began anew, linking the city with the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa in 1917. The Dire Dawa-Harar road was improved in 1928, shortening the travel time to only a few hours. In 1931, the Bank of Ethiopia opened its first branch in the city and, a generation later, the writer C.F. Rey described the city as the most &quot;advanced&quot; urban center in the area, with good roads, electric lights, and piped water.

=== Italian occupation (1936–1941) ===

On 9 May 1936 Dire Dawa was occupied by Italian troops coming from Harar, after Somali troops from Djibouti had prevented looting during the period of interregnum. Badoglio and Graziani celebrated their meeting on the railway station of Dire Dawa. The Italians constructed several new buildings in Dire Dawa, especially for the administration and the Fascist party. They also improved the roads and enlarged the airport so that their military planes could take off from there to bomb the patriot forces in the Gara Mulleta. As for other towns, the Italians conceived a &quot;piano regolatore&quot; for the construction of an Italian town in Dire Dawa. However, their occupation ended before they could complete these plans.

During the Italian invasion, Mussolini ordered that Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa be spared air attacks (which included the use of chemical weapons such as mustard gas) and other destruction as a response to the demands of the United States and certain European countries for the safety of their citizens. The Italian army entered the country from the colonies of Eritrea in the north and Somalia in the southeast. Following all major engagements of the war, Dire Dawa was the location of the meeting of the two Italian forces. General Graziani&#x27;s units, advancing from Harar, reached the city&#x27;s barbed-wire fence on 6 May 1936, the day after the occupation of Addis Ababa and Emperor Haile Selassie&#x27;s flight along the railroad to Djibouti and Palestine. They were met by two French armed cars: the railway remained under French administration and they had remained to protect French interests. The next day, the first train under Italian control left Addis Ababa: it brought Italy&#x27;s 46th Infantry Regiment and finally closed the pincers of the two Italian invasion forces. The occupation of the town was more or less a formality, although the antifascist resistance called the Arbegnoch &quot;Patriots&quot; continued to operate throughout the conflict. It was officially known by its Italian spelling &quot;Dire Daua&quot; during the occupation.

=== Post-Italian occupation (1941–1974) ===

In June 1940 the British started to bomb the town and on 29 March 1941 Dire Dawa was occupied by the Allied forces from Harar. The town remained under British Military Administration, being the headquarters for the British Reserved Area, till it was handed over to the Ethiopian government in 1947. In the following decades the town greatly expanded and the population grew to 160,000. The infrastructure was ameliorated and several industrial plants were established.

Following the restoration of the empire in 1941, Dire Dawa was among the early provincial towns to have its own football league. Around 1947, their teamthe Taffariparticipated in the Ethiopian Championship series. That same year, the Railroad Workers Syndicate of Dire Dawa, a labor union, was formed for welfare purposes. Although its leadership cooperated with the government, its attempt to strike in 1949 was brutally suppressed by imperial troops; at the time, all strikes were seen as forms of insurrection or treason. In 1955, a public address system was installed in the central square to receive and rebroadcast state radio transmissions.

=== Derg administration (1974–1991) ===
The Ethiopian Revolution affected the city in many ways. Starting March 1974, there was some worker unrest; six people were wounded when police opened fire on demonstrating railwaymen and students on 17 April. Many Europeans, Yemeni Arabs, and Indians left Dire Dawa; the Greek and Armenian churches were eventually closed due to dwindling membership. On 3 February 1975, the Derg announced that the Cotton Company of Ethiopia was among 14 textile enterprises to be fully nationalized. The cement factory was also later nationalized. In August 1976, the entire leadership of the local branch of the teachers&#x27; union was sacked for alleged anti-revolutionary activities. Ten new officials were appointed pending fresh elections.

During the Ogaden War, Dire Dawa was attacked during the Battle of Dire Dawa by Somali troops in the summer of 1977. Opposing them were the Second Militia Division, the 201st Battalion, the 781st Battalion of the Seventy-eighth Brigade, the Fourth Mechanized Company, and one platoon of the Eightieth Tank Battalion, with only two tanks. On August 17 the Somalis moved in from the Harewa side to the northeast of the city by night. Despite losing three tanks to landmines en route, they launched a ground and air assault the following day. Initially caught off guard, the Ethiopians had anticipated the attack on Jijiga instead. The battle was fierce, but it was ultimately the Ethiopian air force that shattered the Somali resolve by destroying sixteen of their tanks. By day&#x27;s end, the attackers had exhausted their strength and retreated, leaving behind a trail of abandoned equipment, including tanks, armored cars, rocket launchers, artillery pieces, as well as hundreds of rifles and machine guns, all proudly displayed by the Ethiopian forces. According to Gebru Tareke, the success of the Ethiopian Army in holding Dire Dawa (17–18 August 1977) against the Somali Army was decisive in winning the Ogaden War.

In May 1979, 250 Oromos who were detained in the prisons of Dire Dawa were executed by the Derg regime.

=== Federal Democratic Republic (1991–present) ===
Dire Dawa was occupied by the EPRDF on 31 May 1991 and there were reports of about 100 people killed resisting the EPRDF. Both the Issa and Gurgura Liberation Front and the Oromo Liberation Front claimed the city. As a result, there were numerous clashes between the two groups from 1991 until 1993. When the Somali Regional State was being established in 1993, it wanted Dire Dawa to be its capital. This was opposed by the Oromia Region, of which Dire Dawa was part of at the time, so the federal government placed the city under its own jurisdiction to avoid territorial conflict between the two regions.

On 24 June 2002, a small explosive was detonated at the headquarters of the Ethiopian Railway Commission in Dire Dawa. The Oromo Liberation Front afterwards claimed responsibility for this attack in retaliation &quot;for the continuing harassment of Oromo students, merchants, and farmers by the Ethiopian government.&quot; Although blamed for other isolated incidents, this was the latest bombing inside Ethiopia for which the OLF claimed responsibility.

Dire Dawa moved out of federal administration to become a chartered city in 2004 after the federal parliament approved the city charter in proclamation 416/2004.

The city was flooded in August 2006 when both the &quot;Dechatu River&quot; and the &quot;Gorro River&quot; overflowed their banks. About 200 people were reported dead, thousands were displaced and there was extensive damage to homes and markets especially along the Dechatu River. Floods are fairly common during the June–September rainy season; over 200 people in the region had been killed by flooding in 2005 that did millions of dollars in damage.

An overturned truck, heading from Dengego to Dire Dawa, killed 41 people 4 March 2009. The truck was carrying an unknown number of day laborers when the accident happened, and 38 were immediately killed and as many as 50 were injured. Dead and injured were taken to Dil-chora Hospital in Dire Dawa. The cause was not immediately known.

Currently, there are plans to revitalize the city. A historic and popular part of the city is to be demolished and replaced by a financial center, malls, mixed-use buildings, hotels, recreational facilities, and hospitals. As part of the plan, historical buildings will be renovated, and a new space will be allotted for building new homes and businesses for those displaced by the move. New roads, parks, and an industrial zone will also be built, and major railway project is expected to greatly increase business activity in the city.

== Climate ==

Dire Dawa has a borderline tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;/&quot;As&quot;) just above a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;). The mean annual temperature of Dire Dawa is about . The average maximum temperature of Dire Dawa is , while its average minimum temperature is about . The region has two rain seasons; that is, a small rain season from March to April, and a more pronounced rain season that extends from July to August.

== Demographics ==

The projected population for 1 July 2015 was 440,000 for the entire chartered city and 277,000 for the city proper, making the latter the seventh largest city in Ethiopia.

Traditionally the Nole Oromo clan used the area as grazing land, and farming in the Laga Harre district. They live alongside the Gurgura clan which share both Oromo and Somali identities, speaking the Oromo language and tracing their genealogy to the Dir, a Somali clan family. The Issa subclan of the Dir make up a significant number of urban and rural Dire Dawa, whereas the Gadabuursi subclan of the Dir mainly reside within the urban town and also in the rural areas surrounding the chartered city state.

I.M. Lewis (1998) states:
&quot;Including the land round Harar and Dire Dawa inhabited by the Somalis of the &#x27;Iise and Gadabuursi clans.&quot;
According to the CSA, , 90.76% of the population had safe drinking water: 69.61% of rural and 99.48% of urban inhabitants having access. Values for other reported common indicators of the standard of living for Dire Dawa include the following: 11.4% of the inhabitants fall into the lowest wealth quintile; adult literacy for men is 76.6% and for women 53%; and the civic infant mortality rate is 71 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, which is less than the nationwide average of 77; at least half of these deaths occurred in the infants&#x27; first month of life.

<text>The Grand dictionnaire terminologique (GDT) is an online terminological database containing nearly 3 million French, English and Latin technical terms in 200 industrial, scientific and commercial fields.

The GDT has existed in a number of formats over the years, including a dial-up service known as Banque de terminologie du Québec (BTQ), and a CD-ROM version. LGDT is now available only as a freely-accessible web site.

Produced by the Office québécois de la langue française, the GDT is the result of thirty years of work by Quebec-based terminologists. It is the most complete translation resource for Canadian English-language technical terms.

== Quebec French ==
When translations differ between Quebec French and &quot;Standard French&quot;, – for example in the expression &quot;cerebrovascular accident&quot; (CVA), translated as &quot;accident cérébrovasculaire&quot; (ACV) in Quebec French and &quot;accident vasculaire cérébral&quot; in France – the two forms are both given with a paragraph describing their origins, usage and conformity. The GDT thus allows writers to adapt their writing to suit their audience, be it North American, European or African.

== 1990 Reforms of French orthography ==
The GDT uses the 1990 Reforms of French orthography with loanwords and neologisms. It also prioritises usage of each word by its prominence in other authoritative works.

<text>Lu Zongyu (; 1876–1941) was a pro-Japanese Chinese diplomat at the Paris Peace Conference after World War I. Because of subscribing the Twenty-One Demands supporting Japanese interests, along with Zhang Zongxiang and Cao Rulin, he was labeled as a Hanjian (&quot;traitor to the Chinese people&quot;) by students participating in the May Fourth Movement.

Originally from Zhejiang, Lu was educated in Japan and returned to China where he was a lecturer at Beijing College of Law and Administration. At the time of the instigation of the May Fourth Movement, Lu was the director-general of the Chinese Mint; the president of China, Xu Shichang, was forced to compel his resignation, along with Zhang and Cao&#x27;s, after months of demonstrations, strikes, and meetings.

After his death, he received the courtesy name Runsheng.

<text>The River Itchen flows through east Warwickshire in England. It is a small river, about long, and its general course is from south to north.

==Course==

The River Itchen rises near Wormleighton at and flows into a broad valley to the northeast of a range of ironstone hills which border Warwickshire and Northamptonshire. Shortly after beginning its course it runs under the Oxford Canal. The infant river is fed by several small brooks and skirts the village of Bishop&#x27;s Itchington (to which it gives its name) before passing below the former Great Western Railway London to Birmingham railway (now operated by Chiltern Trains).

A mile-and-a-half north of Bishops Itchington, the River Itchen passes under Deppers Bridge which gives its name to the neighbouring hamlet. A mile further on it passes under the A425 main road west of the town of Southam. Immediately after the bridge, it flows through Stoneythorpe Park and passes the hamlet of Bascote. A mile north of Bascote, the Grand Union Canal crosses the Itchen valley on a half-mile-long embankment, and is carried over the river on an aqueduct.

The River Itchen reaches the large village of Long Itchington (again named from the river) and passes close to the church. West of the village, the river swings to the west briefly and its meandering course is bridged twice by the course of the disused Leamington to Weedon railway line, now a footpath and cycleway.

The River Itchen turns north again and three miles (5 km) further on it reaches Marton where it flows into the River Leam at .

==History==
In 2009 thousands of fish were killed in the River Itchen when poisonous chemicals washed off neighbouring farmland. Later in the year 3500 roach, dace and chub were released into the river to help to replenish stocks.

A section of the river is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, as it &quot;played a significant role in the development of the theory of underfit streams that related change in stream activity to postglacial climatic change and reduced discharges.&quot;

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

<doc id="1242271" wikidata="Q1451732" url="?curid=1242271" title="Women's Health Initiative">
<text>The Women&#x27;s Health Initiative (WHI) was a series of clinical studies initiated by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1991, to address major health issues causing morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal women. It consisted of three clinical trials (CT) and an observational study (OS). In particular, randomized controlled trials were designed and funded that addressed cardiovascular disease, cancer, and osteoporosis.

In its entirety, the WHI enrolled more than 160,000 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years (at time of study enrollment) over 15 years, making it one of the largest U.S. prevention studies of its kind, with a budget of $625 million. A 2014 analysis calculated a net economic return on investment of $37.1 billion for the estrogen-plus-progestin arm of the study&#x27;s hormone trial alone, providing a strong case for the continued use of this variety of large, publicly funded population study. In the years following the WHI, studies have shown a decrease in breast cancer rates in postmenopausal women, attributed to the decline in use of hormone replacement therapy.

However, initial interpretation and communication about the studies&#x27; findings have been criticized for failing to clarify that the studies were weighted toward women already 60 or older (average age 63). This meant that women in their 50s, who tend to be healthier and have more menopausal symptoms, were underrepresented. Systemic hormone therapy has decreased dramatically among U.S. women since the WHI results were published.

==Motivation for the expanded study of women&#x27;s health==
In the 1980s, it had become apparent that past biomedical research had focused disproportionately on white men, often neglecting prevention and treatment studies of diseases that are either unique to or more common in women and minorities. In 1985, the Public Health Service Task Force on Women&#x27;s Health Issues issued recommendations that biomedical and behavioral research should be expanded to provide for the inclusion diseases and conditions identified among women of all age groups. In 1986, the NIH issued recommendations that women be included in all research studies. To further promote the study of women, in 1990, the NIH created the Office of Research on Women&#x27;s Health.

In 1990, however, a report was published by the General Accounting Office (GAO), at the request of the Congressional Caucus on Women&#x27;s Issues, which stated that this NIH policy was not being adequately applied to research grant applications. As a consequence, beginning in 1991, NIH strengthened the policy to require, rather than recommend, the inclusion of women in clinical research (when appropriate) in order to obtain funding.

It was these changes in societal attitudes and policy toward women&#x27;s health research, in addition to the demonstration that such a large study was not only feasible, but could be done economically, that gave rise to the WHI.

==WHI study antecedents and demonstration of feasibility for a large-scale intervention study==
Among postmenopausal women, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and osteoporosis are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, as well as impaired quality of life. Among women in all age groups, cancer and cardiovascular disease are the leading causes of mortality. As the incidence of these diseases increases according to age, women over the age of 50 bear much of the disease burden.

It had been generally accepted that postmenopausal estrogen deficiency may play a role in these morbidities, and that dietary, behavioral, and drug interventions may forestall their development. However, these findings were identified on the basis of epidemiologic observational studies alone. Such interventions would require testing through clinical trials before they, along with their full range of risks and benefits, could be used as the basis for setting public health policy and creating prevention guidelines.

However, concerns existed about the feasibility of such a complex clinical trial among participants in this demographic of older women, particularly with respect to sufficient recruitment and adherence to the dietary and hormone-treatment regimens.

In 1987, the NIH funded the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Intervention (PEPI). The trial followed 875 women who underwent treatment with estrogen, estrogen and progestin, or placebo, and — even quite early in the study — demonstrated both successful recruitment and participant retention/adherence in a hormone therapy (HT) setting. Many of the operational procedures from PEPI, including the study drug dosing, were retained in the larger WHI-HT clinical trial.

In 1984, the NIH provided funding for a feasibility study pertaining to diet adherence, conducted by the Women&#x27;s Health Trial (WHT). The WHT, which commenced in 1986 and involved 303 women randomized into dietary intervention and control groups, yielded results demonstrating a high degree of adherence on the basis of both food-intake questionnaires and clinical laboratory findings. The WHT did not proceed with its full-scale trial, as it was not awarded further funding from the NIH on the basis of the potential inability of the study to test the hypothesis in a larger cohort of women. In 1990, however, interest in the impact of diet on cancer and cardiovascular disease in women was renewed, and a joint National Cancer Institute (NCI)-National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) workshop concluded that a full-scale dietary trial, with a focus on these two diseases, was warranted.

===WHI study announced and planning begins===

On April 19, 1991, Dr. Bernadine Healy, newly appointed as the first female director of the NIH, announced her plan for the Women&#x27;s Health Initiative (WHI). Planning for the WHI CT/OS study began that year. In order to promote cross-institutional collaboration, and to prevent the loss of funding to other women&#x27;s health-related studies, funding was requested and obtained directly from Congress in the form of a discrete line item, with a projected budget of $625 million over the life of the 15-year study.

The NIH awarded the role of Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), located in Seattle, Washington. The CCC&#x27;s responsibilities included the coordination of the 40 study clinics that would eventually recruit women nationwide, as well as ensuring their consistent adherence to the study design and guidelines.

==Design overview, eligibility, and enrollment==
In 1991, working groups were formed to determine the study plan for both the clinical trials (CT) and the observational study (OS). These groups included experts from diverse arenas of medicine, public health, and clinical trial design from both within and outside the NIH.

===Study organization and implementation===
Given the complexity of the WHI study, both in terms of the number of interventions and outcomes studied, as well as the number and geographic distribution of participants and clinical centers, careful orchestration was required. To this end, the WHI maintained a carefully designed organizational structure, along with governance- and science-specific committees and communications channels for staff and investigators to resolve study-related questions and exchange information. As the study launched concurrently with the early stages of modern Internet connectivity, the study centers had to be supplied with computing and networking equipment to connect to the WHI network; WHI-hosted e-mail facilitated the efficient exchange of information among staff and scientists, as well as the transfer of study-related data.

The launch of the study was undertaken in two stages. At first, 16 &quot;vanguard&quot; study centers entered active operation, to evaluate the study protocol and procedures. Once this initial portion of the study was underway, the remaining 24 study centers entered the study around a year later, each assigned to one of the &quot;vanguard&quot; study centers for purposes of mentorship. Study centers were subdivided into four regions, each under the supervision of a regional center, to further facilitate communication and information exchange among study centers.

===Eligibility and enrollment===
The WHI study recruited postmenopausal women in the 50-79 age range, and sought to be as inclusive as practical. The wide nature of the age range balanced the need to observe the effects of hormone therapy on younger women, while also attempting to capture physical and cognitive outcomes in older populations. In addition, a 20% minority enrollment rate was set for all components, to accurately represent the proportion of minorities within the study demographic (17% at the time of the 1990 U.S. Census). To achieve this, 10 of the 40 WHI clinical centers were designated as minority recruitment centers, with enhanced minority recruitment goals.

Eligibility and exclusion criteria also were defined, both study-wide and component-specific. Global inclusion criteria included postmenopausal women, between 50 and 79 years of age, who were willing and able to provide written consent, and who planned to reside in the study recruitment for a least three years after enrollment. Global exclusion criteria included medical conditions that would be predictive of a survival of less than three years, possessing characteristics or conditions that may diminish study adherence (e.g., substance abuse, mental illness, or cognitive impairment), or concurrent enrollment in another randomized controlled clinical trial.

For the CT, a partial factorial study design was utilized for the investigation of three overlapping interventions (dietary modification, hormone therapy, and calcium/vitamin D supplementation), as this would provide considerable cost efficiencies. Willing study-eligible women were asked to join either the hormone therapy (HT trial), the dietary modification (DM) trial, or both. After one year, willing and eligible CT participants were also asked to join the calcium/vitamin D trial (CaD).

Recruitment goals for the HT, DM, and CaD components of the CT were 27,500, 48,000, and 45,000, respectively, each obtained on the basis of calculations of statistical power with regard to the outcomes of interest for each component.

Participants who either did not qualify for or declined to participate in the CT were, if eligible and willing to consent, enrolled in the observational study (OS), which had an enrollment goal of 100,000.

==Study components and primary findings==
The WHI study was composed of four study components, to include three overlapping clinical trial (CT) interventions and one observational study (OS). Component enrollment and the primary findings are summarized in the following two tables, respectively, with additional detail following subsequently:

===Hormone therapy===
The design of the hormone therapy trial (HT) was approached with the hypothesis that estrogen therapy would result in a decrease in coronary heart disease and osteoporosis-related fractures. As such, the primary outcome of interest was coronary heart disease, as this is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among women, particularly those over age 65, and because, at the time, no clinical trial had been undertaken to prove the cardioprotective effects of HT. Due to the concern over the relationship between HT and elevated breast cancer risk, breast cancer was selected as the primary adverse outcome. Additional outcomes monitored included stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.

Two regimens were selected, in addition to a placebo group. Women assigned to the intervention group who had previously undergone a hysterectomy were treated with unopposed estrogen, specifically conjugated estrogens (Premarin, manufactured by Wyeth), at a dosage of 0.625 mg/day (&quot;E-alone,&quot; n = 5310; placebo, n = 5429). Women with an intact uterus were treated by a combined estrogen plus progestin regimen (&quot;E+P,&quot; n = 8506; placebo, n = 8102), specifically the aforementioned estrogen regimen with the addition of 2.5 mg/day of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; Prempro, also manufactured by Wyeth). The addition of progestin has been linked to a marked reduction in the risk for the development of endometrial cancer in women receiving estrogen treatment who have not undergone a hysterectomy.

In addition to the global exclusion criteria, women were ineligible for the HT component if safety was a concern. Such concerns included a breast cancer diagnosis at any time in the past, other cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) diagnosed within the previous 10 years, or low hematocrit or platelet counts.

====HT component findings and ensuing events====
The HT component had originally been designed to include a follow-up period of nine years. However, interim monitoring of the combined estrogen/progestin treatment group indicated an increased risk of breast cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and pulmonary embolism, which outweighed the evidence indicating a benefit in preventing colorectal cancer and fractures. As a consequence, the HT study pills were stopped in July 2002, with an average follow-up period of 5.2 years. The unopposed estrogen trial was halted in February 2004, after an average follow-up period of 6.8 years, on the basis that unopposed estrogen did not appear to affect the risk of heart disease, the primary outcome, which was in contrast to the findings of previous observational studies. On the other hand, there were indications for an increased risk of stroke. Unopposed estrogen did reduce the risk for osteoporotic fractures and, unlike the estrogen/progestin treatment, showed a decrease in breast cancer risk.

As a consequence of the findings, which indicated that the incurred risks of HT outweigh the identified benefits, the study authors recommended that HT not be prescribed for the purpose of chronic disease prevention in postmenopausal women.

The hypothesized and observed risks of specific clinical outcomes are summarized in the following table. Of particular interest are the contrasts between several of the hypothesized risks and the observed attributable risks, which are instructive in demonstrating the distinct differences between the HT trial findings and those of previous observational studies.

Of all the WHI study findings, the HT findings could be argued to have yielded the farthest-reaching societal and economic impacts, and received substantial media attention. Large reductions in HT prescriptions ensued, resulting in a substantial loss of revenue in sales of this class of drugs, with a presumably commensurate savings to patients and insurers. More importantly, in subsequent years, studies have shown a decrease in breast cancer rates in postmenopausal women, attributed to the decline in use of HT.
In 2014, an analysis was conducted to determine the economic impact of the estrogen-plus-progestin trial findings, which calculated the net economic return on investment to be $37.1 billion, owing to a combination of averted health-related expenditures and increased number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).

The United States Preventive Services Task Force, though initially endorsing hormone replacement, in their most recent published recommendation in 2017 discouraged its use for the prevention of chronic diseases such as osteoporosis or cardiovascular disease. When they first evaluated the impact of HRT in 1996, the USPSTF assigned a &quot;B&quot; grade to hormone replacement therapy for use in primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women, basing their results on observational studies and short-term trials. A score of &quot;B&quot; carries an official message of, &quot;The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.&quot; In light of subsequent results from the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) and the WHI trials, the USPSTF downgraded the scoring to a &quot;D,&quot; which corresponds to a message of, &quot;The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits,&quot; and discourages health providers from offering the service or treatment. In 2017 and again in 2022, the USPSTF again evaluated the use of HRT, and again assessed a &quot;D&quot; score. The publication of this most recent recommendation against the use of HRT for the treatment of chronic postmenopausal symptoms was accompanied by several companion editorials, lauding the WHI clinical trial&#x27;s role in preventing patient harm due to HRT administration, noting also the risks inherent to smaller observational studies, which previously had yielded misleading, potentially harmful recommendations to medical practitioners.

It is important to note that this evidence primarily concerns longer-term HRT use for prevention of chronic disease in older women. The USPSTF did not evaluate HRT&#x27;s use for alleviation of symptoms of menopause, whereas the North American Menopause Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the Endocrine Society all continue to recommend it as the most effective therapy for short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms in newly-menopausal women who are under the age of 60 year or within 10 years of entering menopause.

===Dietary modification===
The dietary modification (DM) trial was conducted with the purpose of identifying the effects of a low-fat eating pattern; the primary outcome measures were the incidence of invasive breast and colorectal cancers, fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and overall cardiovascular disease (CVD), calculated as a composite of CHD and stroke.

Women in the trial were randomly assigned to the dietary intervention group (40%; n = 19541) or the control group (60%; n = 29294). In addition to the global exclusion criteria, component-specific exclusion criteria included prior breast cancer, colorectal cancer, other cancers excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer in the past 10 years, adherence or retention concerns (e.g., a substance abuse history or dementia), or a baseline diet that included a fat intake accounting for less than 32% of total energy intake.

Participants in the intervention group underwent a regimen of trainings, group meetings, and consultations which encouraged low-fat eating habits, targeted to 20% of daily caloric intake, along with increasing the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Those assigned to the control group were not asked to adopt any specific dietary changes.

====DM component findings====
The mean follow-up for the DM intervention was 8.1 years. At study years 1 and 6, the dietary fat intake levels for the intervention group were 10.7% and 8.2% less than those of the control group, respectively. The results indicated that, despite some reduction in CVD risk factors (e.g., blood lipids and diastolic blood pressure), there was no significant reduction in the risk of CHD, stroke, or CVD, indicating that a more focused combination of diet and lifestyle interventions may be required to further improve CVD risk factors and reduce overall risk. In addition, no statistically significant reduction in breast cancer risk was identified, although the results approached significance and indicated that longer-term follow-up may yield a more definitive comparison. The trial also did not identify a reduction in colorectal cancer risk attributable to a low-fat dietary pattern.

===Calcium/vitamin D===
The calcium/vitamin D (CaD) trial component was designed to test the hypothesis that women taking a combination of calcium and vitamin D will experience a reduced risk of hip and other fractures, as well as breast and colorectal cancer.

Women participating in this intervention were randomly assigned to receive a regimen of 1000 mg calcium in combination with 400 International Units (IU) of vitamin D (n = 18176) or a placebo (n = 18106), and were followed for an average of 7 years, with monitoring for bone density, fractures, and pathologically confirmed cancers as the measures of outcomes. Women in the CaD trial were already participating in the HT trial, the DM trial, or both. In addition to the global exclusion criteria, component-specific exclusion criteria hypercalcemia, renal calculi, corticosteroid use, and calcitriol use.

====CaD component findings====
Among the intervention cohort, a small but significant improvement in hip bone density was observed, although a significant reduction in hip fractures was not observed. However, subgroup analysis revealed a possible benefit to older women in terms of a reduced risk of hip fractures, attributable to calcium plus vitamin D supplementation.

It was also found that the intervention did not have an effect on the incidence of colorectal cancer, possibly owing to the long latency associated with colorectal cancers. Calcium plus vitamin D was not found to affect the incidence of breast cancer. Finally, an increased risk of kidney stones was observed among those taking calcium plus vitamin D.

===Observational study===
The Observational study (OS) study recruited eligible postmenopausal women (n = 93676) who were either ineligible or unwilling to participate in the CT portion of the study, for the purpose of obtaining additional risk factor information, identifying risk-related biomarkers, and serving as a comparative observational assessment to the CT interventions.

Participants underwent an initial baseline screening, including the collection of physical measurements, blood specimens, an inventory of medications and supplements, and completion of questionnaires pertaining to medical history, family history, reproductive history, lifestyle and behavioral factors, and quality of life. In addition, more specific information was collected with regard to the participant&#x27;s geographic residence history, passive (i.e., &quot;second-hand&quot;) smoking exposure in childhood and adulthood, early life exposures, details of physical activity, weight and weight-cycling history, and occupational exposures. In addition to the baseline data collected, OS participants received annual questionnaire mailings to update selected exposures and outcomes, and were expected to make an additional clinic visit, to include an additional blood collection, about three years post-enrollment. It was planned that participants would be followed for an average of 9 years.

The major outcomes of interest for the OS were coronary heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, osteoporotic fractures, diabetes, and total mortality. Given the size and diversity of the cohort, taken together with the data and specimen collection being undertaken, it was expected that this cohort could yield insights into a variety of hypotheses, as well as generate new hypotheses with respect to disease etiology in women.

====OS component findings====
The WHI OS has and continues to yield many findings and new hypotheses, a small sampling of which are highlighted below:
* A decrease in invasive and ductal breast cancer incidences with decreasing estrogen/progestin combination therapy usage among the OS cohort, which served to corroborate the controlled HT CT trial findings. Other cancer surveillance studies have noted the same trend.
* Identification of putative molecular markers which may predispose (and/or aid early detection) certain populations of women to diabetes and breast cancer.
* Recognition that postmenopausal women are less active than they were during their pre-menopausal years, suggesting a possible benefit for interventions at or around perimenopause. Furthermore, this decrease in activity (e.g., prolonged sedentary activity) can lead to an increased CVD risk.
* A correlation between laxative use and an increased risk of falls, for both extrinsic and intrinsic reasons.
* Identification of a positive correlation between active smoking or extensive exposure to second-hand smoke and an increased risk of breast cancer.
* Identification of a potential positive relationship between alcohol use and the risk of developing certain types of hormone-responsive breast cancers.
* An inverse correlation between whole grain consumption and type-2 diabetes, which is in agreement with previous studies; however, this study found the benefit of whole grain consumption to be lost with any history of smoking.
* Insomnia, in combination with a long- (≥10 hours) or short-duration (≤5 hours) sleep pattern, can substantially augment the risk of CVD and CHD.
* A combined analysis of the OS and CT cohorts found no convincing evidence for the influence of multivitamin supplement usage on common cancers, CVD, or total mortality.
* An analysis of outcomes, approximate participant location, and local air quality data found that long-term exposure to fine particulate (PM2.5) air pollution was associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease and death among postmenopausal women.

==Study extensions, new trials, and the WHI at present==
The WHI study has received three extensions; these extensions are referred to as &quot;Extension Study 1&quot; (2005-2010), &quot;Extension Study 2&quot; (2010-2015), and the recently undertaken &quot;Extension Study 3&quot; (2015-2020). Participants from the first phase of the WHI study were consented and enrolled, with the intention of collecting additional longitudinal data from subjects involved in all of the original study components. The primary outcomes were the same, although greater emphasis was placed on the investigation of cardiovascular disease and aging. Extension Study 1 enrolled 115,403 of the original WHI participants, or 77% of those eligible from the first study phase. Extension Study 2 was able to enroll 93,540 participants, or 87% of those eligible from Extension Study 1. Preliminary estimates for Extension Study 3 participation, as of September 30, 2015, estimate that 36,115 of the Clinical Trial participants and 45,271 Observational Study participants remain active in the WHI study, for a total of 81,386 or 87% of those previously enrolled in Extension Study 2.

===Long Life Study (LLS) ===
A subsample of the Extension Study 2 participants (n = 7875), aged 63–99 and meeting other eligibility criteria, were consented into the Long Life Study (LLS), the purpose of which was to establish new baselines from which new studies in disease and aging can work. In-person visits were conducted to assess and collect physical and functional measurements, as well as blood to replenish the WHI biospecimen repository and determine current CBC parameters for these participants. The LLS completed its in-person visits and blood collections in May 2013.

A large subset of the LLS participants (n ≈ 7400) were further enrolled in the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health in Women (OPACH) study, the purpose of which was to assess physical activity in women capable of ambulation. These women were asked to maintain a week-long sleep log, wear an accelerometer for a week, and keep track of falls on a month basis for one year. The goal was to establish a stronger correlation between physical activity and cardiovascular disease and total mortality.

===COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS)===
The COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS) at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, WA) was a four-year clinical trial with more than 21,000 women and men, recruited from across the U.S. The study was supported by Mars and Pfizer. The objective of the study was to investigate whether either cocoa flavanols (600 mg/day) or a common multivitamin affects the risk of developing heart disease, stroke, and cancer. First results showed no effect on the pre-registered primary endpoints (incidences of heart disease and cancer), but they did show an effect on secondary endpoints with a reduction in heart disease mortality for cocoa flavanols and a reduction of lung cancer risk for multivitamins.

===Women&#x27;s Health Initiative Strong &amp; Healthy (WHISH)===
The Women&#x27;s Health Initiative Strong and Healthy Study (WHISH), started in 2015 and expected to last four years, seeks to examine the impact of physical activity in older women on certain outcomes such as heart disease and metrics including maintaining an independent lifestyle. The study has enrolled nearly 50,000 participants as of October 2016, whose assigned interventions will include varying physical activity routines, which are monitored by mail and via phone, using an interactive voice response (IVR) system.

===Other ancillary studies===
Public health investigators and biostatisticians can apply to use WHI study data in conjunction with their investigations. As of June 2013, nearly 450 Ancillary Studies have been proposed. Newly generated data from these Ancillary Studies must be submitted to the WHI, which in turn provides a richer data resource for subsequent studies.

In addition to the study data, data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted on participant DNA is available on the NIH-hosted Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).

===Significant extension study findings===
Analysis during the post-intervention period following the estrogen-plus-progestin trial continues to reveal the strong association between estrogen- plus-progestin usage and breast cancer risk. Following the halt of the estrogen-plus-progestin trial, there was a sharp decrease in breast cancer risk in the early post-intervention period, though the hazard ratio remained greater than 1, followed by a sustained risk during the late post-intervention period that was significantly greater than 1. It is hypothesized that the initial decrease was due to the resulting change in the hormone environment, while the subsequent persistent increase in breast cancer incidence may be attributed to the persistence of oncogenic mutations and subsequent expansion of these mutation-harboring cell lineages. The most recent update, published July 28, 2020 in JAMA, reported that increased breast cancer risk has persisted among women randomized to estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95%CI, 1.13 -1.45; P-value &lt; 0.001).

In contrast, breast cancer risk was significantly lower for the estrogen-alone group compared to placebo during the post-intervention period. Specifically, the reduction of breast cancer incidence persisted throughout the early post-intervention phase. Lower breast cancer risk among the estrogen-alone group remained for the most recent update (HR, 0.78; 95%CI, 0.65-0.93; P-value = 0.005). In addition, statistically significantly lower breast cancer mortality was reported (HR, 0.60; 95%CI, 0.37-0.97; P = 0.04).

Regarding endometrial cancer, although estrogen-plus-progestin use during the intervention period suggested a reduction in cancer incidence, the difference became statistically significant with additional follow-up from the extension period. These findings highlight the completely different long-term influences estrogen plus progestin have on endometrial cancer and breast cancer.

According to a cumulative 18-year follow-up analysis published in 2017, it was found that, among 27,347 postmenopausal women who had originally participated in the WHI hormone therapy trials, interventions using estrogen-plus-progestin and estrogen-alone were not associated with increased or decreased risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, or total cancer mortality.

Of note, mortality is a rather limited summary because it does not include non-fatal CVD and non-fatal cancer events that may have long term consequences on health and quality of life. Post-menopausal women considering initiation of HT and their clinicians should refer to previous WHI publications for a complete summary of risks for fatal and non-fatal events.

The Dietary Modification intervention has also yielded new findings, after nearly two decades of follow-up. During the dietary intervention period (median, 8.1 years), it was found that a low-fat dietary pattern led to a lower incidence of death (from all causes) after breast cancer (40 deaths versus 94 in the &quot;normal diet&quot; arm; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.94, P = .02.). After a median 16.1 years of cumulative follow-up (inclusive of the intervention period), further analysis showed that this benefit persisted (234 deaths versus 443 in the &quot;normal diet&quot; arm; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.96 with P = .01). A more recent update, with 19.6 years of cumulative follow-up, reported the persistent reduction of death (from all-causes) after breast cancer continued (359 v 652 deaths; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.96; P = .01) and a statistically significant reduction in deaths as a result of breast cancer (breast cancer followed by death directly attributed to the breast cancer) emerged (132 v 251 deaths; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.97; P = .02).

Another recent analysis of Dietary Modification intervention outcomes showed a 30% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk among women having normal blood pressure (n = 23,248) and partaking in a low-fat dietary pattern (122 versus 256 CHD events; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.87 during the intervention period). Participants with existing cardiovascular disease at baseline (n = 1,656) were at higher risk of developing coronary heart disease, both during the intervention and extended follow-up periods (101 versus 116 CHD events, HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.93; and 36 versus 44, HR, 1.61 95% CI 1.02 to 2.55, respectively). The increased among women with prior CVD was likely due to post-randomization confounding, resulting in some difficulty in interpretation. Women in the diet intervention group were more likely to report changes in statin use (either cessation or initiation) post-randomization than women in the comparison group.

Secondary analyses concluded that the dietary intervention did not increase risk of diabetes, but instead slowed progression. During the trial, intervention group women had lower rates of initiation of insulin therapy (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.94; P = 0.01) and through cumulative follow-up (HR, 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99; P = 0.04).

These types of analysis, conducted more than a decade after the halt of the intervention trials, serves further to demonstrate the long-term value and return on investment yielded by the WHI study.

===Publications and citations===
As of September 2018, the WHI has reviewed 3,154 writing proposals, of which 1,725 have been published in scientific journals.

According to a 2013 analysis of extramural clinical trials supported by the NHLBI, the components of the WHI study have been some of the most frequently cited in the literature, with the E+P trial ranking first among all NHLBI-sponsored clinical trials, alone averaging 812.5 citations annually (total average annual number of citations for the WHI study interventions, 1233.3). In addition, the WHI study component findings were found to reach publication in a timely manner, despite the study&#x27;s negative trial findings (see NEJM Supplementary Appendix for detailed findings).

===Awards and accolades===
In 2015, the WHI study was awarded the 2015 Team Science Award from the Association for Clinical and Translational Science (ACTS), &quot;given in recognition of the WHI team&#x27;s success in the translation of research discoveries into clinical applications and, eventually, widespread clinical practice.&quot;

In April 2016, the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), the oldest and largest research society of its kind, awarded the WHI study the 2016 Team Science Award in recognition of its more than 20 years of work, which ultimately &quot;singularly changed the face of women&#x27;s medicine around the world.&quot;

==Criticisms of the WHI&#x27;s design and findings==
The WHI trial was limited by low adherence, high attrition, inadequate power to detect risks for some outcomes, and evaluation of few regimens. Subsequent to publication of the WHI, controversy arose regarding the applicability of its findings to women just entering menopause. To be properly double blinded, the study required that women not be perimenopausal or have symptoms of menopause. As the average age of menopause is 51, this resulted in an older study population, with an average age of 63. Only 3.5% of the women were 50–54 years of age, the time when women usually decide whether to initiate hormonal therapy. Further analysis of WHI data, however, demonstrated that there is no gained preventive benefit in starting hormone therapy soon after menopause.

Most fundamentally, the WHI did not address the major indication for MHT use: relief of symptoms. Rather, the stated goal of the HT component was to test the long-term cardiovascular-protective effects (rather than treatment of menopausal symptoms) of HT in postmenopausal women, which had been supported by previous observational studies in terms of how it reduces atherosclerotic diseases by lowering serum lipid levels and promoting vasodilation. In an expert consensus statement from The Endocrine Society, evidence from the WHI trial was weighted less than that of a randomized controlled trial according to the GRADE system criteria because of mitigating factors: large dropout rate; lack of adequate representation of applicable group of women (i.e. those initiating therapy at the time of menopause); and modifying influences from prior hormone use. However, the editor of one of the journals which published the results of the WHI called it a &quot;landmark&quot; study. The double blinding limited validity of study results due to its effects on patient exclusion criteria. The dominant majority of participants were Caucasian, and tended to be slightly overweight and former smokers, with the necessary health risks for which these demographics predispose. Furthermore, the focus of the WHI study was disease prevention. Most women take hormone therapy to treat symptoms of menopause rather than for disease prevention and therefore the risks and benefits of hormone therapy in the general population differ from those of the women included in the WHI. Despite these concerns, the original findings of the WHI trial have been accepted by reputable journals, and have withstood the scrutiny of subsequent reanalysis of the study data.

<text>Polish Auxiliary Corps (, , ) was the name of the Polish military formation in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Formed from the Polish Legions, it was created on 20 September 1916 and existed until 19 February 1918. In the aftermath of the Oath crisis, some members of the corps, mainly the 1st, and 3rd Brigades, were forcibly drafted into the main Austro-Hungarian Army or imprisoned. Those of the 2nd Brigade remained in The Polish Auxiliary Corps and formed the basis for the German Polnische Wehrmacht. This lasted until 16 February 1918, when Jozef Haller and the 2nd Brigade rebelled, due to the unfavorable terms found within the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, leading to the corps&#x27; disbandment. Members of this formation fought in the Battle of Rarańcza and Battle of Kaniów, merging with the Polish II Corps in Russia.

<text>Gernot Zippe (November 1917 – 7 May 2008) was an Austrian mechanical engineer and a nuclear physicist of German origin who is widely credited with leading the team which developed the Zippe-type centrifuge– a centrifuge machine for the enrichment and collection of uranium-235, during his time in the former Soviet program of nuclear weapons.

==Biography==

Zippe was born in Warnsdorf which was then part of the Austria-Hungary in November 1917. The Zippe family later moved to Vienna which allowed him to attend the University of Vienna and earned his doctorate in mechanical engineering in 1939. Zippe had earlier interests in aeronautical engineering and was a civilian flight instructor in the German Luftwaffe; while he also filled a role as a researcher on radar and propellers. 
===In Russia===
During the World War II, Zippe was captured by the Red Army and held in Soviet custody in Prague until 1946 when the Soviet intelligence, the NKVD, learned of his technical background and moved him to Russia to work on the isotope separation for the feasibility of the weapon-grade uranium. Zippe who had never worked on a centrifuge before took over the project but he worked Max Steenbeck on the feasibility of the machine with the provided Russian intelligence on the works of American Jesse Beams from the Manhattan Project. The project was carried out at the Institute A in Sukhumi and was being overseen by German physicist, Manfred von Ardenne, and directed by another German scientist Max Steenbeck, whose theoretical achievements Zippe used to successful deployment in 1950. 

In 1952, Zippe was transferred to Saint Petersburg to continue his work on the efficiency with the Russian scientists, which he stayed until 1954. It was an standard practice by the captured German scientists to quarantine if they had work on the Soviet program of nuclear weapons, which Zippe did while being interned in transition camp in Kyiv.

===In Germany===

In 1956, Zippe was notified by the Soviet administration in Ukraine of his release, and he decided to settle in Germany as opposed to Austria. In 1957, Zippe attended the conference on centrifuge research in Amsterdam, he realized the rest of the world was far behind what his team had been able to achieve. During this time, Zippe was able to found an employment with AMOLF as a consultant on centrifuge technology. In 1965, Zippe left AMOLF to join the Duggas AG (now Trade name: Evonik Industries) as a consultant until 1969 when he decided to join the consultant staff of the Urenco Group until his retirement in 1990.

It was the Dutch physicist who filed and applied for the first patent in the European and U.S. patents authorities as a functional gas-ultracentrifuge developed at AMOLF, which he credited after Zippe: Zippe-type.

===In the United States===

In 1960, Zippe traveled to the United States on the sponsorship of the University of Virginia, facilitated by Jesse Beams, where he did an unclassified postdoctoral research on the centrifuge technology. In spite of his notes confiscated by the Soviet government, Zippe was able to re-create the centrifuge machine and published a research thesis on the development and efficiency of the gas centrifuge at the University of Virginia in the United States.

Impressed by his work, the United States government tried to recruit him for an on-going centrifuge program but he was restricted from gaining the classified information on the United States&#x27; nuclear weapons program; he refused and returned to work with German firms. Following his return to Germany, the United States Atomic Energy Commission awarded contract works to its private firms to start work on the gas centrifuge, and marked his technical reports as classified documents on 1 August 1960.

==Personal interests and reputation ==
While working as consultant in the Urenco Group in Amsterdam, he was able to improve the efficiency of the gas centrifuge. He enjoyed flying and flew planes until he was 80 years old. Zippe passed away in Bad Tölz, Bavaria, Germany, on 7 May 2008, aged 90.

From 2006–08, Zippe was a subject of interests in European political media which noted that his invention made it cheaper to produce fuel for nuclear reactors but also to build nuclear weapons, which increased the risk of nuclear proliferation. When asked if he has any regrets, he responded, &quot;With a kitchen knife you can peel a potato or kill your neighbor, it&#x27;s up to governments to use the centrifuge for the benefit of mankind.&quot;

Although, the United States and the European media credited Gernot Zippe of being the innovator of the machine, the Russian sources, however, disputed the account of Soviet centrifuge development given by Gernot Zippe. The Russians credited Max Steenbeck, as the German scientist in charge of the German part of the Soviet centrifuge effort, Isaac Kikoin and Evgeni Kamenev with originating different valuable aspects of the design. 

The Russian accounts stated that Zippe was engaged in building prototypes for the project for two years from 1953 but, since the centrifuge project was with the &quot;Top Secret&quot; designation, the Russians did not challenge any of Zippe&#x27;s claims at that time.

<text>Gali ( ; , &quot;Gal&quot;) is a town in Abkhazia, Georgia, 77 km southeast of Sukhumi. It is the center of Gali District and was in the United Nations security zone prior to the Russian veto of the UNOMIG Mission in 2009. As of 2011 the town has a population of 7 605 inhabitants.
==History==
Gali was granted town status in 1932.

On 15 April 1953, the newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot; reported that the residents of Gali were celebrating the 132nd birthday of its oldest resident, Tlabgan Ketsba, and that he had founded the town in the 19th century.

<text>The Confederate blockade runner CSS &quot;Florida, was built at [[Greenpoint, New York|Greenpoint]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1859. Considered for service as a [[gunboat]] three times during the [[American Civil War]], the vessel was captured by the [[Union Navy]] on April 6, 1862. The ship was taken into service by the Union and renamedUSS &quot;Hendrick Hudson.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Florida&quot; was thrice considered for a gunboat before she became one. Contrary to previous interpretation of the official records, closer comparison of entries reveals that she did not serve the Mississippi River Defense Fleet as originally intended but became a Government-owned blockade runner; most authors have confused her with the Mobilian CSS &quot;Florida&quot; who did not receive her name until July 1862. CSS &quot;Florida&quot; of New Orleans was one of 14 steamers of Charles Morgan&#x27;s Southern Steamship Co. which Major General Mansfield Lovell &quot;impressed for public service&quot; at New Orleans, January 15, 1862, acting on Confederate Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin&#x27;s orders.

Lieutenant Beverly Kennon, CSN, had sought &quot;Florida&quot;″s command but had to be content with . He nostalgically described &quot;Florida&quot; to a court of inquiry as &quot;a very fast and a very handsome vessel indeed... A direct-acting screw of about 100 horsepower [75 kW] …about the same size in all respects as the U.S. steam sloop .&quot;

Of the several ships of the same name, she apparently is the &quot;Florida&quot; which arrived at Havana, Cuba on March 23, 1862 with 1,000 bales of cotton. Attempting to repeat her success, she had loaded 211 bales in St. Joseph Bay near Pensacola, Florida when captured by Acting Master Elnathan Lewis, USN, with armed boats from the bark USS &quot;Pursuit&quot; on April 6. The boarders had just captured a sloop, &quot;Lafayette&quot;, at St. Andrew&#x27;s, Florida, 20 miles below, and the latter&#x27;s Captain Harrison volunteered to pilot Lewis&#x27; party on up to capture &quot;Florida&quot;. Surprised at 4 o&#x27;clock Sunday morning, &quot;Florida&quot;&#x27;s crew were unable to fire their ship.

It later appeared that the pilot, chief mate, first and second engineers were Union sympathizers. Mr. Lewis, after running &quot;Florida&quot; aground twice and jettisoning 30 bales of cargo, found &quot;it was impossible to bring her out without the assistance of the engineers, pilot, and mate; so rather than burn her he considered it prudent to bargain with them, and gave his word that they would receive $500.00 each. They were faithful.&quot;

In the 30 mile (50 km) passage to the bar, &quot;Florida&quot; and &quot;Lafayette&quot; were almost recaptured by the Confederates on April 8 after Captain R. L. Smith, CSA, and his company of dragoons had galloped 24 hours from Marianna, Florida to intercept them off St. Andrew&#x27;s. A ship&#x27;s boat was ambushed with four casualties, one dead, but the prizes continued on to Key West. There, on April 19, 1862, Commodore William McKean reporting to United States Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles confirmed that &quot;Florida&quot; had never been converted: &quot;I have examined her, and find that her upper deck is too light to carry guns of any weight. I have not the means to strengthen her sufficiently, or I should retain and convert her into a gunboat.&quot; Despite this rejection, the U.S. Navy bought &quot;Florida&quot; from the Philadelphia prize court on September 20, 1862, changed her name to USS &quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot; and placed 4, later 5, guns on board.

=== Union service ===
&quot;Hendrick Hudson&quot; served in the East Gulf Blockading Squadron for the remainder of the war, capturing two schooners and sinking the blockade runner &quot;Wild Pigeon&quot;. Two members of her crew received the Medal of Honor for their actions at the Battle of Natural Bridge. She was sold into commercial service in 1865, and sunk near Havana, Cuba in 1867.

<doc id="1242307" wikidata="Q1529857" url="?curid=1242307" title="Steve Hislop">
<text>Robert Steven Hislop (11 January 1962 – 30 July 2003) was a Scottish motorcycle racer. Hislop won at the Isle of Man TT eleven times, was the British 250cc Champion (1990) and lifted the British Superbike championship on two occasions (1995 and 2002).

Hislop died when piloting his Robinson R44 helicopter in July 2003. He was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame in March 2010.

==Biography==

Hislop was born into a close, Scottish Borders family. He grew up in the village of Chesters near the town of Hawick with his father Sandy, mother Margaret and younger brother Garry [his best friend]. Sandy encouraged his boys to be enthusiastic about competitive motorcycling and take up racing. However, when Garry was killed in a racing accident at Silloth circuit in 1982 aged 19, Hislop&#x27;s enthusiasm waned and he slumped into an alcohol fuelled depression (the death of his father three years earlier from a heart attack may also have contributed).

==Racing career==
===Isle of Man TT===
Hislop began his Isle of Man road racing career in 1983 by finishing second in the newcomers&#x27; race at the Manx Grand Prix.

The 1992 Senior TT is often described as one of the best races in TT history. Hislop was on Ron Haslam&#x27;s Norton 588. Hislop&#x27;s took to the circuit in the unconventional white livery of long-term sponsor Abus. He came a good second in the opening TT F1 race, with the bike proving it could complete six laps of the gruelling Snaefell Mountain Course in hot weather.

A number of adjustments had been made to the Norton prior to the Senior TT: a larger screen was fitted to protect Hislop from the high winds, the front mudguard was removed to admit more cooling air to the engine and protective covers were fitted to the front forks.

Hislop&#x27;s main rival was Carl Fogarty, who started at number four. Hislop started at 19. This give the Scot more traffic to contend with but the time difference between the two never exceeded 7.4 seconds. The two riders smashed records they had set the previous year, with Hislop taking a narrow advantage into the final lap. In a last-ditch attempt to catch Hislop, Fogarty recorded a record lap time of more than 123 mph on his Yamaha. It was all in vain, however, as Hislop guided the Norton home in first place – one of Hislop&#x27;s greatest achievement in his last battle with Fogarty.

===Short circuits===
On short circuits, Hislop&#x27;s first championship success came when he won the 250cc British Championship in 1990. Superbike victory followed with the British Superbike Championship in 1995. Although he did not take a BSB victory in 1996 or 1997, Hislop was hired by Rob McElnea strong Cadbury&#x27;s Boost Yamaha team for 1998. The nature of the fight for the championship between Hislop and team-mate Niall Mackenzie was illustrated by a near-collision on the last lap at Snetterton, which cost the team a 1–2 finish. Hislop generally matched his countryman before an injurious crash took him out of title contention.

His last championship success came in 2002 when he won the British Superbike Championship riding a Ducati. A notable feature of his season resulted from Hislop lapping Donington Park circuit more quickly on a superbike than the fastest Moto GP machine: Hislop&#x27;s modified production Ducati was heavier and less powerful than the bespoke Grand Prix bikes.

==Personal life==
Hislop had two children by former partner Kelly Bailey, the first called Aaron Hislop but the couple split just before his second son Connor was born. He had joint custody of the children, and had found love again with girlfriend Ally Greenwood.

Hislop died in a helicopter accident near Teviothead, Roxburghshire and was interred in the village of Chesters near his birthplace of Hawick, Scotland.

===Legacy===

* Knickerbrook Chicane at the Oulton Park circuit in Cheshire was renamed &quot;Hislops Chicane&quot; following re-development over the 2003 winter period.
* There is a bronze statue in memory of Hislop on Onchan Head, Isle of Man
* There is a bronze statue in memory of Hizzy in Wilton park, Hawick, near his hometown of Denholm. It is unusual as it is a life-sized image of Hizzy in his leathers and is mounted at ground level.
*Hislop has a museum room all about him at Wilton park. It displays trophies, some of Hislop&#x27;s bikes and leathers. It also has x-rays taken after Hizzy broke his neck.
*There is an Annual Hizzy Run which Starts and finishes in Denholm Green. The run was started in 2003 by fellow racer and friend Alan Duffus to raise money for the bronze statues which were put in place 2005. The Run is still going and regularly attracts hundreds of bikers who listen to speeches made by friends and fellow racers.

<text>Donald Francis Henderson (10 November 1931 – 22 June 1997) was an English actor. He was known for playing both &quot;tough guy&quot; roles and authority figures, and is remembered for his portrayal of detective George Bulman between 1976 and 1987 in the popular Granada Television police drama series &quot;The XYY Man&quot;, &quot;Strangers&quot;, and &quot;Bulman&quot;, as priest Frank Kane in BBC drama &quot;The Paradise Club&quot; (1989–90), and as General Taggi in the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film (1977). This last role also brought him attention from science fiction fans, and he later appeared in the cult science fiction television series &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

==Biography==
Henderson was born into a working-class family in Leytonstone, Essex, the son of a carpenter, and grew up in Epping. After completing his national service as a technician in the Royal Army Dental Corps, he served with Essex Constabulary, reaching the rank of detective sergeant in their CID, and worked as an insurance salesman. He did not become a professional actor until his thirties, when a friend dared him to audition for the Royal Shakespeare Company, with whom he subsequently performed from 1966 until 1972, going on to play many leading roles.

Henderson had two children, a son and a daughter, with his first wife Hilary, who died from a mysterious lung disease in 1977. He remarried in 1979; his second wife was the actress Shirley Stelfox, with whom he would appear professionally many times. He lived in his adopted home town of Stratford-upon-Avon for many years, where he was a familiar face to locals.

==Career==
Henderson is best remembered for his role as the fictional detective George Bulman. This character featured in three TV series: &quot;The XYY Man&quot; in the mid-1970s; the later &quot;Strangers&quot; that saw Bulman rise from Detective Sergeant to Detective Chief Inspector and, in 1985, the series &quot;Bulman&quot; saw George retired from the police and pursuing a career as a horologist. He also starred in the popular TV drama series &quot;Warship&quot;.

Henderson made little money from his role in Star Wars—£300 for one day of filming. He also missed out on a large sum for his copy of the Star Wars script:
&quot;I have only once been recognised as having been in Star Wars, and that was when I was making a film in Los Angeles. Somebody in the hotel I was staying at offered me $2000 for my copy of the Star Wars script. As I growled at him in amazement, he took that as a refusal, or that he had offered too little and eventually went up to an offer of $5000! Sadly, as with all my used scripts, I had given it to my kids to scribble and draw on.&quot;

==Death==
Henderson was first diagnosed with throat cancer in 1980. He died of the disease in Warwick on 22 June 1997, aged 65, and was survived by his second wife and his children. Stelfox herself died of cancer in 2015.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; &quot;O fir tree&quot;), known in English as &quot;O Christmas Tree&quot;, is a German Christmas song. Based on a traditional folk song that was unrelated to the holiday, it became associated with the traditional Christmas tree.

==History==
The modern lyrics were written in 1824 by the Leipzig organist, teacher and composer Ernst Anschütz. A &quot;Tannenbaum&quot; is a fir tree. The lyrics do not actually refer to Christmas, or describe a decorated Christmas tree. Instead, they refer to the fir&#x27;s evergreen quality as a symbol of constancy and faithfulness.

Anschütz based his text on a 16th-century Silesian folk song by Melchior Franck, &quot;&quot;. In 1819 August Zarnack wrote a tragic love song inspired by this folk song, taking the evergreen, &quot;faithful&quot; fir tree as contrasting with a faithless lover. The folk song first became associated with Christmas with Anschütz, who added two verses of his own to the first, traditional verse. The custom of the Christmas tree developed in the course of the 19th century, and the song came to be seen as a Christmas carol. Anschütz&#x27;s version still had (true, faithful) as the adjective describing the fir&#x27;s leaves (needles), harking back to the contrast to the faithless maiden of the folk song. This was changed to (green) at some point in the 20th century, after the song had come to be associated with Christmas.

The tune is an old folk tune attested in the 16th century. It is also known as the tune of &quot;&quot; (&quot;Long Live the Carpenter’s Apprentice&quot;) and of &quot;&quot; (&quot;Time’s A-flying&quot;).

Wie treu sind deine Blätter!
Du grünst nicht nur zur Sommerzeit,
Nein, auch im Winter, wenn es schneit.
O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum,
Wie treu sind deine Blätter!

O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum,
Du kannst mir sehr gefallen!
Wie oft hat nicht zur Weihnachtszeit.

Ein Baum von dir mich hoch erfreut!

==Professional career==

===Pre-draft measurables===
===Atlanta Falcons===
Crumpler was selected by the Falcons in the second round (35th overall) of the 2001 NFL draft. Crumpler made the first start of his NFL career against the Carolina Panthers on September 23, 2001. He caught his first two passes for a total of 13 yards. His first touchdown was scored against the New Orleans Saints, on October 21, 2001. He finished his rookie season starting 12 of 16 games and totaling 25 receptions for 330 yards and three touchdowns. In 2002, Crumpler started 9 of 16 games, recording 36 receptions for 455 yards and five touchdowns.

Crumpler earned his first Pro Bowl honor in 2003, starting all 16 games for the Falcons, catching 44 passes for 552 yards, the most for a Falcons tight end since 1980; he also had three touchdowns. Crumpler played in and started 14 games for the Falcons in 2004, who advanced to the NFC Championship Game. Crumpler finished the regular season with 48 receptions for 774 yards and six touchdowns and was elected to the Pro Bowl. In 2005, Crumpler returned to start 16 games for the Falcons, setting career highs with 65 receptions for 877 yards, as well as five touchdowns. He was also named to his third-consecutive Pro Bowl.

In 2006, Crumpler set a career-high with eight touchdowns, while also making 56 catches for 780 yards in 16 games started. Crumpler made 10 starts in 14 games in 2007, in his first season without Michael Vick at quarterback. He finished the year with 42 receptions for 444 yards and five touchdowns. In December 2007, Crumpler was fined by the NFL for wearing black eye strips during a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; which had the letters MV and the number 7 written on them in support of Vick, who was in prison at the time.

On February 15, 2008, Crumpler was released by the Falcons.

===Tennessee Titans===
On March 2, 2008, Crumpler signed with the Tennessee Titans. He made his debut with the team on September 7, 2008, against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He started 15 games for the Titans in 2008, making 24 catches for 257 yards. In the Titans&#x27; Divisional Playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens, Crumpler fumbled after a reception from Kerry Collins on the Ravens&#x27; 5-yard line, which helped the Ravens ultimately win the game over the top-seeded Titans.

On August 9, 2009, in the Titans&#x27; first preseason game, Crumpler weighed approximately 300 pounds, gaining an estimated 30 pounds during the offseason. However, Crumpler played in all 16 games for the Titans in 2009, starting 14 and catching 27 passes for 222 yards and one touchdown. He was also part of a blocking unit that aided Titans running back Chris Johnson in a 2,006-yard rushing season.

===New England Patriots===
On March 24, 2010, Crumpler signed with the New England Patriots. After running back Kevin Faulk, an offensive captain, was lost for the season with a knee injury in Week 2, the team named Crumpler an offensive captain prior to their Week 6 game. The next day, head coach Bill Belichick lauded Crumpler&#x27;s professionalism:
Crumpler finished the 2010 season with six receptions for 52 yards and two touchdowns in 16 games played (10 starts).

On July 29, 2011, the Patriots announced that Crumpler had been released.

<doc id="1242328" wikidata="Q638249" url="?curid=1242328" title="Scharführer">
<text>Scharführer (, ) was a title or rank used in early 20th century German military terminology. In German, &quot;Schar&quot; was one term for the smallest sub-unit, equivalent to (for example) a &quot;troop&quot;, &quot;squad&quot;, or &quot;section&quot;. The word &quot;führer&quot; simply meant &quot;leader&quot;.

The term &quot;Scharführer&quot; can be traced to World War I, when it was referred to a NCO in charge of several shock troopers, or other special forces soldiers.

It was, however, used far more widely by Nazi Party paramilitary organizations, such as the Schutzstaffel, National Socialist Flyers&#x27; Corps, National Socialist Motor Corps, and the Sturmabteilung, between 1925 and 1945 and became strongly associated with them.

==Nazi usage==
&quot;Scharführer&quot; is most recognizable as a rank of the SS and title of the SA. &quot;Scharführer&quot; was first used as a title in the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) as early as 1921 and became an actual rank in 1928. &quot;Scharführer&quot; was the first non-commissioned officer rank of the SA, and was denoted by a single pip centered on a collar patch. In 1930, veteran &quot;Scharführer&quot; were appointed to the new rank of SA-&quot;Oberscharführer&quot;, denoted by an additional silver stripe to the &quot;Scharführer&quot; collar patch.

The &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) used the same insignia for &quot;Scharführer&quot; as the SA, but the level of rank changed in 1934 with a reorganization of the SS rank structure. At that time, the old rank of SS-&quot;Scharführer&quot; became known as SS-&quot;Unterscharführer&quot; with the title of SS-&quot;Scharführer&quot; becoming equivalent to an SA-&quot;Oberscharführer&quot;. The rank of SS-&quot;Truppführer&quot; was removed from the SS, to be replaced by SS-&quot;Oberscharführer&quot; and the new rank of SS-&quot;Hauptscharführer&quot;. The early Waffen-SS created an even higher rank, known as SS-&quot;Sturmscharführer&quot;.

Within the SA, &quot;Scharführer&quot; was senior to the rank of SA-&quot;Rottenführer&quot; while in the SS, a &quot;Scharführer&quot; was senior to that of SS-&quot;Unterscharführer&quot;. The rank of &quot;Scharführer&quot; was also used by other Nazi Party organizations; among them the National Socialist Flyers Corps (NSFK), National Socialist Motorist Corps (NSKK) and the Hitler Youth (HJ).

<doc id="1242340" wikidata="Q360459" url="?curid=1242340" title="Adobo">
<text>&#x27; or &#x27; (Spanish: marinade, sauce, or seasoning) is the immersion of food in a stock (or sauce) composed variously of paprika, oregano, salt, garlic, and vinegar to preserve and enhance its flavor. The Portuguese variant is known as . The practice, native to Iberia (Spanish cuisine and Portuguese cuisine), was widely adopted in Latin America, as well as Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia.

In the Philippines, the name was given by colonial-era Spaniards on the islands to a different indigenous cooking method that also uses vinegar. Although similar, this developed independently of Spanish influence.

== Characteristics ==
In the years following the arrival of Europeans to the Americas, meat and fish began to be preserved by new methods. Low temperatures facilitate food preservation, but in higher temperatures, other techniques, such as &quot;adobo&quot;, became necessary. Animals were usually slaughtered in the coldest months of winter, but surplus meat had to be preserved in the warmer months. This was facilitated through the use of &quot;adobos&quot; (marinades) along with paprika (a substance that may have antimicrobial properties due to the capsaicin content). Paprika gives a reddish color to &quot;adobos&quot;, and the capsaicins in paprika dissolve in fats, allowing its penetration beyond the tissue surface.

== Applications ==
&quot;Adobo&quot; was employed initially as a method of food preservation, but in time—with the advent of refrigeration methods—it came to be used primarily as a method of flavoring foods before cooking. Traditional preparations were created with the intent of flavoring, such as &quot;cazón en adobo&quot; (dogfish in adobo, made from school shark and originating from Cadiz, a city in the Cádiz province of Spain); &quot;berenjenas de Almagro&quot; (Almagro aubergine, a pickled aubergine characteristic of &quot;Manchega&quot; cuisine from the Castile-La Mancha region of Spain, specifically from Almagro, a city in the Ciudad Real province of Spain); and &quot;lomo en adobo&quot; (tenderloin of beef or pork in adobo).

== Variations ==
The noun form of &quot;adobo&quot; describes a marinade or seasoning mix. Recipes vary widely by region: Puerto Rican &quot;adobo&quot;, a rub used principally on meats, differs greatly from the Mexican variety. Meat marinated or seasoned with an &quot;adobo&quot; is referred to as &quot;adobado&quot; or &quot;adobada&quot;.

=== Mexico ===

In Mexico, &quot;adobo&quot; refers to a condiment or cooking sauce with a base containing chillies, particularly Chipotle and Ancho peppers. An Ancho pepper is a Poblano chili that is dried after it turns red. These sauces are used as a marinade and to add a smoky, spicy flavor.

==== &quot;Chipotles en adobo&quot; ====

&quot;Adobo&quot; relates to marinated dishes such as &quot;chipotles en adobo&quot; in which chipotles (smoked ripe jalapeño peppers) are stewed in a sauce with tomatoes, garlic, vinegar, salt, and spices. The spices vary, but generally include several types of peppers (in addition to the chipotle and most likely those on hand), ground cumin and dried oregano. Some recipes include orange juice and lemon or lime juices. They often include a pinch of brown sugar just to offset any bitter taste.

===Puerto Rico===
Puerto Rican-style &quot;adobo&quot; is a seasoned salt that is generously sprinkled or rubbed on meats and seafood prior to grilling, sautéing, or frying. Supermarkets sell prepared blends. There are two types of &quot;adobo&quot; on the island. The wet rub, &quot;adobo mojado&quot;, consists of crushed garlic, olive oil, salt, black pepper, dry or fresh &quot;lippia&quot; (Caribbean oregano), citrus juice and vinegar. More widely used on the island is a dry mix, &quot;adobo seco&quot;. It is easier to prepare and has a long shelf life. &quot;Adobo seco&quot; consists of garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, dry lippia, and sometimes dried citrus zest.

===Peru===
Adobo is a typical dish of Peruvian cuisine, specifically in the area of Arequipa. This is a dish of pork marinated in spices and vegetables, which are cooked in a clay pot until it becomes tender. Bread is served alongside for dipping in the sauce.

===Philippines===

In Filipino cuisine, &quot;adobo&quot; refers to a common and indigenous cooking method. In the late 16th century, the Spanish referred to it as &quot;adobo&quot; due to its superficial similarity.

The main ingredients of Philippine &quot;adobo&quot; are ingredients native to Southeast Asia, namely vinegar, soy sauce or fish sauce, peppercorns, garlic, and bay leaves. It does not traditionally use chilis, paprika, oregano, or tomatoes. Rather, &quot;adobo&quot; is characteristically salty and sour, and often sweet taste. Another version is cooking it with coconut milk which turns it into &quot;ginataang adobo&quot;.

=== Uruguay ===
In Uruguay, adobo is a spice mix of the same spices of the Spanish marinade. Also, &quot;adobar&quot; is the act of using this mix as a condiment. A sauce made of adobo, salt and water is called &quot;mojo&quot;.

==History==

One of the earliest references to adobo is found in the &quot;Manual del Cocinero, Repostero, Pastelero, Confitero Y Botillero&quot; by Mariano de Rementeria y Fica in 1850.

<text>Loewy is a small lunar impact crater that lies along the eastern rim of Mare Humorum, in the southwest part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after French astronomer Maurice Loewy. This is a lava-flooded formation that lies to the southwest of the larger, lava-flooded crater Agatharchides. To the southeast is an even larger lava-flooded formation, Hippalus.

The rim of Loewy is worn and eroded, with a break in the southwest where lava may have flooded into the interior from the surrounding lunar mare. The formation is not quite circular, being somewhat elongated towards the southeast. There is a small craterlet, Loewy A, along the northeastern rim. The interior floor is level and nearly featureless. Attached to the northern exterior of the rim is Agatharchides C, a bowl-shaped crater.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Loewy.

<doc id="1242349" wikidata="Q6302850" url="?curid=1242349" title="Judicial Circuits Act">
<text>The Judicial Circuits Act of 1866 (ch. 210, ) reorganized the United States circuit courts and provided for the gradual elimination of several seats on the Supreme Court of the United States. It was signed into law on July 23, 1866, by President Andrew Johnson. It in effect denied him the opportunity of appointing any justices to the Supreme Court. It was the first major legislation dealing with the judiciary following the American Civil War.

The Act redrew the boundaries of the judicial circuits and reduced the number of circuits from ten to nine. It also provided for the gradual reduction in the number of seats on the Supreme Court from the ten that had been authorized in 1863 to seven and established in large measure the geographical outlines of the circuits ever since.

As it happened, only two seats, those of John Catron and James Moore Wayne, were abolished during the brief three-year interval of the Act&#x27;s efficacy, before being superseded by the Judiciary Act of 1869. Thus, it never actually happened that the Court was reduced to seven in accordance with the language of the 1866 Act; rather, while it was in effect the Court comprised first nine and then eight justices. With the 1869 Act, Congress set the size of the Supreme Court at a total of nine justices once again. However, because the death of Robert Cooper Grier created another vacancy in 1870 before a ninth justice could be appointed to the Court, the Court&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; strength was actually reduced to the seven that had been stipulated by the 1866 Act, albeit shortly after that Act was no longer in force. Eventually, Grier was replaced by William Strong, and Joseph P. Bradley was installed in the lately created seat, restoring the Court to its new &quot;de jure&quot; strength of nine.

The subsequent stability in circuit organization ended a period of frequent rearrangement of the states within the circuits. After establishing nine circuits in 1837, Congress in 1842 shifted several southern states in order to accommodate transportation routes used by the justices when traveling on circuit. In 1862 Congress incorporated six additional states into a restructured system of nine circuits, and within another year had abolished the California Circuit, placed California and Oregon in a Tenth Circuit, and reorganized the mid-western states. The 1866 Act ended a period in which the arrangement of the states into circuits was frequently reorganized. Since then, the geographical outline of the circuits has only been altered by the addition of new states to circuits and the division of two large circuits in the twentieth century. 

The geographical reorganization of the circuits in 1866 coincided with the broader effort of the Republican majority in Congress to reduce what it considered the disproportionate influence enjoyed by the southern states before the Civil War. Between 1837 and 1862, five of the nine circuits comprised exclusively slave states. The tradition of appointing a justice from each circuit allowed Southern slaveowners to dominate the Supreme Court. After reducing the number of all-southern circuits in 1862, Congress in 1866 left only two circuits that comprised only former slave states, and only one that comprised only former Confederate states.

The reduction in the size of the Supreme Court nullified the pending nomination of Henry Stanbery to the tenth seat on the Court and prevented President Andrew Johnson from appointing a justice during the remainder of his term. The legislation owed less to the Republican opposition and to Johnson, who signed the act, than to the efforts of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase. The first draft of the bill proposed a return to nine justices, thus preventing tie votes on the Court and providing a justice for each circuit. In private communication with influential members of Congress and fellow justices, Chase urged a further reduction in the number of seats in hopes of winning approval for an increase in the justices&#x27; salaries. Congress did not approve an increase in judicial salaries until 1871, after it had returned the size of the Court to nine seats.

<doc id="1242351" wikidata="Q638847" url="?curid=1242351" title="Tiki Barber">
<text>Atiim Kiambu &quot;Tiki&quot; Barber Sr (; born April 7, 1975) is an American former professional football running back who spent his entire 10-year career with the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Virginia Cavaliers. Barber was selected by the Giants in the second round of the 1997 NFL draft. Barber retired from the NFL at the end of the 2006 NFL postseason as the Giants&#x27; all-time rushing and reception leader. He is one of only four players with 5,000 rushing yards and 5,000 receiving yards. Barber was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 2011.

Following his playing career, Barber became a national media presence, notably joining NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot; as a correspondent in 2007 and &quot;Football Night in America/Sunday Night Football&quot;. He has published multiple books.

He is the identical twin brother of NFL Hall of Fame former Tampa Bay Buccaneers cornerback and safety Ronde Barber.

==College career==
Barber attended the University of Virginia on an academic scholarship to major in commerce. While he maintained his focus on his studies, Barber also became an accomplished college athlete; he broke the University of Virginia&#x27;s long jump record on his first jump, and put the University of Virginia&#x27;s football program back on the map.

Barber rushed for almost 1,400 yards in his junior season, helping lead the Cavaliers to a share of the ACC title.

During his senior year, he rushed for over 1,300 yards and was named ACC Player of the Year.

Barber finished his college career with 651 carries for 3,389 yards and 31 touchdowns, and 64 receptions for 602 yards with two touchdowns.

During Barber&#x27;s time at UVa, he was a member of the IMP Society, one of the university&#x27;s secret societies.

==Professional career==
Originally he was considered a third-down, &quot;change of pace&quot; back, but Barber became a standout starting running back and the all-time leader in rushing yards in New York Giants history. In 2005, he was the NFL&#x27;s top yardage gainer from the line of scrimmage. Barber was voted by his peers to three Pro Bowls. From 2003 to 2006, Barber gained the most yards from scrimmage by any NFL running back in that four-year period.

===1997–1999===
Barber was selected by the New York Giants in the second round of the 1997 NFL draft, out of the University of Virginia. He was originally intended to be a third-down running back until Rodney Hampton had disappointing years in 1996 and 1997. Hampton retired after the 1997 season, giving Barber the starting nod. He began his career with a mediocre rookie campaign, in which he started at running back and rushed for 511 yards and three touchdowns. Barber missed four games with a knee injury, but returned to the starting lineup for the final two games of the year. In 1998, he was replaced as a starter and went through a disappointing, injury-riddled year before rebounding in 1999, when he accumulated 1,639 all-purpose yards, utilizing his punt return and receiving skills.

===2000–2004===
Barber and the Giants represented the NFC in Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, but lost the game to the Baltimore Ravens. Established as a starter and playmaker, Barber was rewarded with a six-year contract from the Giants following the 2000 season. Following the signing, he called himself &quot;the happiest man in New York right now.&quot;

Over the next four years, Barber would become an integral part of the Giants&#x27; offense. In the last regular season game of 2002, Tiki exploded for 203 yards against the Philadelphia Eagles, at that time one of the league&#x27;s best defenses. His performance helped the Giants clinch a playoff berth, but the team fell to the San Francisco 49ers in the wild-card round. He ended the season with 1,984 yards from scrimmage.

The 2003 NFL season saw the Giants finish 4–12.

During the 2004 NFL season, Barber reached the end zone for a career-high 15 touchdowns. He also rushed for 1,518 yards and notched 578 receiving yards for 2,096 total yards from scrimmage. On January 2, 2005, in the 2004 season finale, at home versus the Dallas Cowboys, Barber broke Rodney Hampton&#x27;s Giants&#x27; all-time rushing record and Joe Morris&#x27;s single-season rushing record in the same game. Poignantly, Barber broke the record on the final offensive play of the game, when he scored a game-winning touchdown to end an otherwise dismal 6–10 season for the Giants on a high note.

===2005 season===
The 2005 season was a rebound year for the Giants and for Barber&#x27;s career year in terms of rushing yards. Led by Eli Manning and Barber, they finished 11-5 and won the NFC East title for the first time since 2000. On December 17, 2005, Barber broke the Giants&#x27; single-game rushing record against the Kansas City Chiefs, rushing for 220 yards; he would break his own record the following year. It was his second (of three) 200-yard rushing games during the 2005 season, as he ran for 206 yards in week 8. The Giants promptly shut out the Washington Redskins 36-0 two days after Wellington Mara was buried, proper homage to their beloved owner, to whom Tiki himself was especially close.

He finished the 2005 regular season with 1,860 rushing yards (second in the league to Shaun Alexander and a career-high for Barber) and 2,390 all-purpose yards with a performance of 203 rushing yards against the Oakland Raiders in the final game of the season. Barber&#x27;s 95-yard touchdown run set a Giants&#x27; team record for longest touchdown run, previously held by Hap Moran for a 91-yard run on November 23, 1930, vs the Green Bay Packers.

His 960 yards from scrimmage in December 2005 was an NFL record until it was broken by Chris Johnson, who had 968 from scrimmage in November 2009.

The Giants were shut out 23–0 to the Carolina Panthers in the wild-card round of the playoffs.

Barber&#x27;s 2,390 total yards for 2005 was second highest in NFL history, at the time, behind Marshall Faulk&#x27;s 2,429 total yards in 1999. It is also the highest total for a running back 30 years of age or older. He was named to the NFC Pro Bowl squad for the second time in his career, and was voted an All Pro. Barber placed fourth in the voting for the 2005 MVP award. Seattle Seahawks running back Shaun Alexander won the Award, followed by Peyton Manning (second place) and Tom Brady (third place).

He was nominated for the 2005 FedEx Ground Player of the Year Award, along with LaDainian Tomlinson and Shaun Alexander. Barber also signed a contract extension in September 2005 which extended his contract through 2008 and increased his pay.

===2006 season===
In the 2006 season, Barber continued his fine play in his final season and final games as an NFL player, a rarity for running backs who often break down late in their careers. His total yardage on the season was higher than any other running back in history in their last season.

Barber rushed for 1,662 yards and five touchdowns in his 2006 campaign. During week 14 at Carolina, Barber rushed for 112 yards to help the Giants end a four-game losing skid. Tiki&#x27;s best game in 2006 was in Week 17 at Washington, where he rushed for 234 yards and 4 touchdowns in the Giants 34–28 victory against the Redskins, a win that gave the Giants a playoff berth. In that game, Tiki set a new team record for rushing yards in a single game by breaking his own record, which he had set the previous year versus Kansas City. His 234 rushing yards are the most ever by a player over 30 years old. He also holds the record for most 200-yard rushing games by a player over 30 years old with four. Only three other players have one.

In his final game with the Giants, a playoff loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Barber rushed for 137 yards on 26 carries. After the game, Eagles safety Brian Dawkins embraced Barber and told him, &quot;You&#x27;re a warrior.&quot; Barber has stated a tackle from Eagles middle linebacker Jeremiah Trotter during the 2006 season confirmed his decision to retire.

As a Pro Bowler in his final season, Barber&#x27;s last official game was the 2007 Pro Bowl on February 10, 2007, in Hawaii.

===NFL retirement===
In October 2006, Barber revealed his intention to retire at the end of the 2006 NFL season. Barber had previously indicated his desire to retire at some point and pursue a broadcasting career. When questioned why a player at the peak of his game would retire, Barber cited the toll the physical nature of football takes on a person&#x27;s body and that he &quot;simply couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.&quot; He officially filed his retirement papers with the Players Association on February 12, 2007.

During his career with the Giants, the team never won a championship, a top goal of Barber&#x27;s that he spoke publicly about in 2005. When announcing his retirement, Barber seemed at peace to leave the game without a Super Bowl ring. He said, &quot;I used to think my career was defined by not winning a Super Bowl. But I think looking back on my career, they&#x27;ll see someone who was a competitor, someone who always played hard and never gave up.&quot; He officially filed his retirement papers with the Players Association on February 12, 2007.

In the very next NFL season following Barber&#x27;s retirement, the New York Giants went on to defeat the previously undefeated 18–0 New England Patriots to win Super Bowl XLII in one of the greatest upsets in sports history. Barber was present to cover the event, but was not well received by most of his former teammates and Giants&#x27; fans, after his disparaging remarks about his former teammate and Giants quarterback, Eli Manning.

===Attempted NFL return===
On March 8, 2011, Barber filed paperwork to come out of retirement. Although the New York Giants still retained the rights to Barber, the Giants planned to release him once the NFL and the NFLPA reached a collective bargaining agreement.

On April 28, 2011, Barber said that his comeback was &quot;not about the money;&quot; however, the &quot;New York Post&quot; ran a contradictory news story in 2010, reporting that Barber was seeking to return to the NFL because he was not financially solvent. The story said that he was unable to pay his divorce settlement with his ex-wife.

On July 28, 2011, the Giants officially removed Barber from the retired list, allowing him to sign with any team. On August 2, 2011, Barber began working out with the Miami Dolphins.

On September 5, 2011, Barber&#x27;s agent, Mark Lepselter, confirmed that no NFL team was interested in signing him.

==Player profile==

===Running style===
Starting from his breakout season in 2000, Barber was known for his exceptional cutback running, quick feet, and running vision. He also was an adept receiver out of the backfield with over 450 receiving yards and over 50 receptions every season from 2000 to 2006.

After the 2003 year, in spite of his rushing yard totals, Barber had a tendency to commit fumbles. He committed nine fumbles and six lost fumbles in the 2002 and 2003 seasons, respectively. This also includes three lost fumbles in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles on December 28, 2002. When head coach Tom Coughlin arrived, he taught Barber to hold the ball vertically instead of horizontally, a practice taken from rugby football. After making this change, his fumbles went down significantly. In 2004, he only had two lost fumbles and proceeded to commit only four lost fumbles in his three years with Coughlin.

Barber began to focus on strength training and lifting in 2004 upon the suggestion of his new running backs coach, Jerald Ingram. Barber began to work with a strength coach, Joe Carini, in New Jersey. His added upper-body strength allowed him to break more tackles and improve as a running-back. Barber improved in other ways over the course of his career. He refined upon his patience during game-play, which is needed in football to wait for blocks to set and formed holes to emerge in the offensive line before accelerating forward. Barber also improved upon his physical toughness and blocking ability, as he was not known for being skilled in them earlier in his career. Barber additionally benefited from an improved offensive line and Coughlin&#x27;s emphasis on the Giants&#x27; new strategic running game.

===Strahan contract controversy===

In 2002, All-Pro Giants defensive end Michael Strahan was negotiating a new contract, and Tiki Barber publicly criticized Michael Strahan&#x27;s negotiating stance. He felt Strahan should have agreed to the contract the Giants offered and remarked that Strahan was greedy. The contract impacted the team as Strahan&#x27;s cap number exceeded $12 million and the new contract would have lowered Strahan&#x27;s cap number, greatly helping the team get under the 2002 Salary Cap. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if he realizes how much $17 million is,&quot; Barber told the NY Post. &quot;That is absolutely ridiculous, to turn that down. He&#x27;s already the highest-paid defensive player in the league. He&#x27;s already making more than most quarterbacks...Michael is not thinking about the team; he&#x27;s thinking about himself&quot;.

Keith Hamilton, a teammate of Strahan and Barber at the time, then responded with comments critical of Barber. Players generally believe that they should not speak about the contracts of other players. Beyond that, some members of the Giants defense harbored resentment of the offense, which was lackluster and unproductive in the 1990s. &quot;The defense has carried the offense, carried the team, since I&#x27;ve been here,&quot; Hamilton told The Star-Ledger. &quot;[Barber] hasn&#x27;t been here long enough or done enough to say anything. For him to shoot his mouth off, acting like he&#x27;s Mr. New York, yeah, I&#x27;m ticked off. Strahan is the single-season sack record-holder. He&#x27;s the AP Defensive Player of the Year. He&#x27;s one of the best—if not the best—defensive ends in the game. And you tell me this guy is being greedy? That&#x27;s a bunch of crap. I&#x27;ve heard enough. Who is Tiki Barber to shoot his mouth off? What has he done? He talks like he&#x27;s acting in the best interest of the team. Tell him to give his $7 million (signing bonus) back. Since he&#x27;s so charitable, why doesn&#x27;t he volunteer his $7 million? He says all the politically correct things. Ask him if he&#x27;s giving up some of his money.&quot; Despite this incident, Strahan and Barber are currently friendly with each other in public.

===Coaching criticism===
Although Barber&#x27;s statistics improved greatly after Tom Coughlin became the Giants&#x27; head coach, Barber disliked and criticized Coughlin&#x27;s coaching style. During the coach&#x27;s tenure, Barber publicly questioned the team&#x27;s coaching on two occasions. After being shut out at home in the first round of the 2005 playoffs by the Carolina Panthers, Tiki made a post-game comment that he felt the Giants had been outcoached by their former defensive coordinator, the Panthers&#x27; head coach John Fox. Heavy sports media attention was placed on the comment; Tiki apologized for it shortly afterwards, saying he only meant to convey the Giants&#x27; performance was &#x27;unacceptable.&#x27;

After a loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars during the 2006 season, Barber criticized the playcalling for abandoning the running game too soon.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSLS%2FMGArticle%2FSLS_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1149191834676&amp;path=!sports Tiki Barber upset with lack of carries] , Associated Press News Service. Retrieved January 11, 2007&lt;/ref&quot;&gt;Tiki Barber upset with lack of carries , Associated Press News Service. Retrieved January 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Both times Coughlin and Barber met to discuss the comments.

On the eve of what would be his last game with the Giants, Barber told ESPN that he is &quot;demeaned and talked down to&quot; by Coughlin.

After retiring, Barber attributed his decision to retire to Coughlin&#x27;s unrelenting style in practice. &quot;(Coughlin) pushed me in the direction (of television),&quot; said Barber. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if you realize this, but we were in full pads for 17 weeks, and with the amount of injuries that we had, it just takes a toll on you. You physically don&#x27;t want to be out there, when your body feels the way you do, in full pads.&quot;

The Giants went on to win the Super Bowl the year following Barber&#x27;s retirement.

==Post-football career==

===Broadcasting===
After retiring from the NFL, Barber began a second career as a television broadcaster. Barber immediately landed a role with NBC in which he contributed to the &quot;Today&quot; program, covered sports for NBC Sports, and hosted entertainment events for NBC Universal. Barber was introduced as a correspondent for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; and analyst for &quot;Football Night in America/Sunday Night Football&quot; on February 13, 2007. This came after a competition for his services was waged between ABC, FOX, NFL, and NBC. As a &quot;Today&quot; correspondent, Barber anchored lifestyle segments and reports on news stories.

Barber is unusual among retired athletes in his desire to cover hard news and political stories; in 2006 Barber cited a lunch with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as the highlight of his year.

While still an NFL player, Barber gained broadcasting experience. On television, he co-hosted the morning news program &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; on select Tuesday mornings. On radio, he hosted &quot;Barber Shop&quot; a weekly show on Sirius Satellite Radio with his brother Ronde during the football season. In the offseason, he hosted a political and general interest radio program; Senator John McCain was his first interview. Barber originally began his broadcasting career on WFAN radio and the WCBS local news in New York.

In May 2008, Barber filled the spot of Willie Geist on the MSNBC program &quot;Morning Joe&quot; while Geist was on vacation.

In August 2008, Barber helped broadcast the 2008 Summer Olympics on MSNBC and was a commentator for Yahoo! sports for the 2010 Winter Olympics.

On Wednesday, June 23, 2010, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that NBC dropped him from his contributor&#x27;s role on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot;. Barber was quietly let go in May 2010 by the network after his contract was not renewed by NBC earlier that year.

Barber appeared as a studio pundit on the BBC&#x27;s Super Bowl XLV coverage.

In January 2022, Barber became a radio co-host for WFAN with Brandon Tierney, on weekday afternoons airing 10-2pm (EST). The pair previously hosted a national show on CBS Sports Radio.

In June 2023, the &quot;New York Post&quot; broke the news that Barber would take the spot of Craig Carton on afternoon drive at WFAN with Evan Roberts beginning in July 2023. As of March 2024, Evan and Tiki currently host the WFAN afternoon drive program.

===Miscellaneous TV appearances===
Barber is a frequent judge on the Food Network show &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;, along with the show &quot;Chopped&quot;.

Barber appeared as a guest judge on &quot;Project Runway&quot;. The challenge was to design Barber a dress shirt to wear on the &quot;Today Show&quot;.

Barber appeared with his family on NBC&#x27;s show &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; which premiered on June 24, 2008.

Barber appeared as the guest in the &quot;Not My Job&quot; section of the NPR news quiz show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; in November 2008. He answered three questions about Mickey Mouse on the occasion of Mickey&#x27;s 80th birthday.

Barber was the &#x27;mobile shout out&#x27; on an episode of the Discovery Channel game show &quot;Cash Cab&quot;. The question was &quot;What is the name of the famous John Steinbeck novel that followed the travels of Tom Joad?&quot;. Both Barber and the contestant incorrectly answered with &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; by Larry McMurtry; the correct answer was &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.

In the 2008 series &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, Barber played a drill sergeant who was murdered during an underground MMA fight in the episode &quot;Fight Knight&quot;. His character was filmed dressing down an unseen private and used by KITT to distract the owner of the illegal club long enough to allow for capture by Michael. He was also spoofed by KITT at the end of the episode.

Barber appears in multiple episodes as himself in the 2009 iteration of &quot;The Electric Company&quot;. His &quot;character&quot; is adored by women and adolescents alike and is portrayed as a very likable and forthright role model. One episode even puts him in the role of a judge, trying a case of pet negligence towards his bird.

In the Dave Matthews Band music video for their 2001 single &quot;Everyday,&quot; Barber was featured as one of the people being hugged.

In 2014, Barber appeared as himself in &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; in the Season 2 episode &quot;It Was the Change&quot; which was the 12th episode of the season.

Barber made his Broadway debut as Don in &quot;Kinky Boots&quot; January 21, 2019, and played a limited run until March 3. Barber said in a statement, &quot;I was very fortunate to be part of the New York Giants for ten years and feel incredibly lucky to be joining another New York institution: Broadway.&quot;

==Business activities==
Barber is pursuing business and investment opportunities, reportedly inking a contract to serve as a partner and investor in O Beverages LLC, the maker of fruit-infused bottled water as well as opening a high-tech cycling gym in NYC.

Barber is co-chairman and co-founder of Thuzio, which provides an online marketplace for athletes to be booked for local speaking appearances, coaching, and personal events.

In 2018 Barber co-founded Grove Group Management, a cannabis-focused investment firm that provides various forms of expertise (finance, marketing, operations, retail, legal issues, and product development) to the businesses it invests in. The company aims to work with small and minority-owned cannabis businesses in particular.

==Personal life==
Barber and his twin brother were born five weeks premature. Tiki was born seven minutes after his identical twin brother Ronde Barber. He was named Atiim Kiambu, which means &quot;fiery-tempered king&quot; because he was screaming shortly after his birth. Ronde was a cornerback who played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, winning Super Bowl XXXVII against the Oakland Raiders, and was elected to the NFL Hall of Fame in 2023.

Barber is the son of Geraldine Barber and James Barber. James was a star running back at Virginia Tech and later played in the World Football League. Barber&#x27;s parents divorced when Barber was very young; his father never provided financial support and rarely saw his sons when they were growing up. His mother Geraldine worked two—sometimes three—jobs to support her three sons. He has an older brother, Tarik Barber.

Barber married his University of Virginia sweetheart Virginia Cha Barber on May 15, 1999, and the couple resided on the Upper East Side New York City with Cha&#x27;s parents living in an en suite. Cha—of Korean and Vietnamese descent—was a fashion publicist for Zegna, a men&#x27;s designer-clothing label. They have two sons, A.J. (Atiim Kiambu Junior), born July 8, 2002, and Chason, born March 18, 2004; and twin daughters Riley and Ella, born May 24, 2010.

On April 5, 2010, while Cha was seven months pregnant with their twin daughters, it was announced that Barber and his wife were separating after 11 years of marriage. It later became public that Barber had been cheating on Cha with 23-year-old Traci Lynn Johnson, whom he met while she was an NBC intern and he worked on the &quot;Today&quot; show. Johnson had babysat Barber&#x27;s sons.

In the May 30, 2011, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Barber described hiding out with Johnson in his agent Mark Lepselter&#x27;s attic so that he would not get caught. Barber was quoted as saying that &quot;Lep&#x27;s Jewish, and it was like a reverse Anne Frank thing.&quot; Barber&#x27;s comments were quickly condemned by &quot;New York Post&quot; sports columnist Mike Vaccaro.

Just eight days after his divorce from Cha was final, on July 20, 2012, Barber and Johnson married in a simple civil ceremony in a New York courtroom. Johnson gave birth to their daughter Brooklyn on December 27, 2013. In July 2016, their second daughter, and Barber&#x27;s sixth child, Teagan, was born.

In 2014, Barber supported CC Sabathia&#x27;s charity, the PitCCh In Foundation, by running in the 2014 New York City Marathon. He achieved a 5:14:37 running time.

==Books==
On September 18, 2007, Barber&#x27;s book, &quot;Tiki: My Life and the Game Beyond&quot; was published. The autobiography was co-written by Gil Reavill. His second book, &quot;Tiki Barber&#x27;s Pure Hard Workout&quot;, which was released on November 13, 2008, by Gotham Books, reveals Barber&#x27;s intensive lifting program. The book is coauthored by his trainer, Joe Carini.

Barber has authored nine illustrated children&#x27;s books with his brother Ronde.

<text>Pierre-Richard Prosper (born September 19, 1963) is an American lawyer, prosecutor and former government official. He served as the second United States Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2005.

==Early life and education==
Prosper was born in Denver, Colorado, to two physicians who emigrated from Haiti. He was raised in Upstate New York, where he graduated from Shenendehowa High School in Clifton Park, New York. He obtained an undergraduate degree from Boston College and a Juris Doctor degree from Pepperdine University School of Law.

==Career==
Prosper was a Deputy District Attorney for Los Angeles County, California from 1989 to 1994. His last two years in this position were spent in the Hardcore Gang Division of the Bureau of Special Operations, where he prosecuted gang-related murders. From 1994 to 1996, he was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Central District of California in Los Angeles. He was assigned to the Narcotics Section, Drug Enforcement Task Force, where he investigated and prosecuted major international drug cartels.

From 1996 to late 1998, Prosper served as a war crimes prosecutor for the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. He was appointed lead trial attorney and prosecuted Prosecutor vs. Jean-Paul Akayesu, the first-ever case of genocide under the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. In the 14-month trial, he won additional life-sentence convictions for crimes against humanity and broke new ground in international law by convincing the Tribunal to recognize rape committed in time of conflict as an act of genocide and a crime against humanity. Prosper recounts the trial in the 2015 documentary film, &quot;The Uncondemned&quot;.

Prosper served as a career prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice where he was Special Assistant to the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division in 1999. From 1999 to 2001, Prosper was detailed to the State Department where he served as the Special Counsel and Policy Adviser to the previous Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues.

Prosper was nominated by President George W. Bush on May 16, 2001 to become the second U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues. He was confirmed by the United States Senate, and sworn in on July 13, 2001, and served until late 2005. 

As the President&#x27;s envoy and senior diplomat, Prosper traveled worldwide conducting diplomatic negotiations and consultations with heads of state, foreign ministers, and senior government officials from over 60 different countries. He also engaged foreign parliaments and multilateral and international organizations to build support for U.S. policies. He regularly visited conflict zones in efforts to secure peace, stability, and the rule of law. In this capacity, Prosper formulated and coordinated U.S. government policy responses to atrocities and attacks against civilians throughout the world. He reported to U.S. Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice and advised the President of the United States, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, National Security Advisor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, White House Counsel, and other senior U.S. government officials. 

After the September 11 attacks, Prosper played a role in developing policy to confront terrorism. He was also the chief US negotiator and lead diplomat responsible for engaging nations regarding their nationals held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and captured by US forces in combat. From 2008-2012, Ambassador Prosper was elected to the United Nations&#x27; Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, where he served as Vice-Chairman for the last two years of his service.

Currently, Prosper holds the position of Partner in the Los Angeles office of ArentFox Schiff LLP, where he has handled several high-profile cases. These include advising and representing the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste on matters related to the Petroleum sector, investment and infrastructure development; successfully negotiated the release of an American citizen detained in the Islamic Republic of Iran through repeated travels to Iran and engagement with senior Iranian officials; and advises and represents the government of Rwanda on a range of matters including international arbitration, litigation, and contract negotiation, among others. Prosper also serves as a trustee on the Boston College Board of Trustees.

In September 2013, he became a member of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) Panel of Arbitrators and of Conciliators, where he will be asked by disputing parties or by the ICSID to serve on conciliation commissions seeking to resolve international investment disputes commenced under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.

In September 2018, Prosper was appointed to the Pepperdine University School of Law Board of Trustees.

Sometime between October 2018 and May 2019, Chinese video surveillance company Hikvision retained Prosper to advise the company regarding human rights compliance according to an emailed statement from a Hikvision spokesman. Hikvision cameras were used in Uyghur internment camps.

<doc id="1242364" wikidata="Q2062417" url="?curid=1242364" title="Steven Jackson">
<text>Steven Rashad Jackson (born July 22, 1983) is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons, primarily with the St. Louis Rams. He played college football for the Oregon State Beavers and was selected in the first round of the 2004 NFL draft by the Rams, where he spent his first nine seasons. In his final three seasons, he was a member of the Atlanta Falcons from 2013 to 2014 and the New England Patriots in 2015. Named to three Pro Bowls and two All-Pro teams during his Rams tenure, Jackson is the franchise&#x27;s all-time leading rusher.

==Early life==
Jackson was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, and was a running back for Eldorado High School. He was named the Sunrise Regional MVP and rushed for 6,396 yards and 81 touchdowns for the Sundevils. Eldorado lost in the state final his senior year to McQueen High School (Reno, Nevada). He also lettered four years in track and field, recording a 10.6 in the 100 meters as a junior, and was a member of the 4 × 100 m (42.64 s) relay squad.

Jackson&#x27;s subsequent success has been credited with prompting college football programs to take more interest in players in the Las Vegas area. This success also led to Jackson&#x27;s induction into the Southern Nevada Sports Hall of Fame in 2011.

==College career==
Jackson attended Oregon State University, where he played for the Beavers for three seasons (2001–2003). In 36 games, he carried 743 times for 3,625 yards for a 4.9-yard average and 39 touchdowns while adding 680 yards and six touchdowns on 66 catches and 240 yards with a touchdown on seven kickoff returns. His 4,545 all-purpose yards rank second in school history, while he ranks third on the school&#x27;s all-time scoring list with 276 points. In his sophomore season, Jackson led the Pac-10 Conference in rushing and finished the season eighth nationally with 1,690 yards; an average of 130 yards per game. As a junior, he ranked tenth in the nation in rushing, ninth in all-purpose yardage, and fourth in scoring; he carried the ball 350 times for 1,545 yards and 19 touchdowns, adding 44 receptions for 470 yards and three touchdowns. When his collegiate career ended, Jackson&#x27;s 2,015 all-purpose yards set an Oregon State school record.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Pre-draft===

Jackson was overlooked by several teams in 2004, most likely due to a knee injury suffered during his last year at Oregon State that kept him from participating in drills at the 2004 NFL Combine. Jackson had surgery on the knee after the college season, but required additional surgery after his rookie year to ensure its complete rehabilitation. In an interview with CBS Sports&#x27; Pete Prisco on how the knee injury had affected his play, Jackson said, &quot;I never felt right. Now it does.&quot;

===St. Louis Rams===

Jackson was drafted in the first round with the 24th overall pick in the 2004 NFL draft by the St. Louis Rams. He was the first running back to be selected that year. The Rams traded picks with the Denver Broncos and Cincinnati Bengals to get Jackson. Denver traded Deltha O&#x27;Neal to Cincinnati for their first round pick. Then, St. Louis traded up to Cincinnati&#x27;s selection to grab Jackson while the Bengals chose Chris Perry to replace the departed Corey Dillon, who was traded to the New England Patriots.

====2004 season====
On July 30, 2004, Jackson signed a five-year, $18.73 million deal with the Rams, which included a $2.5 million signing bonus. In his 2004 rookie season, he was a backup under Marshall Faulk. He made his NFL debut in the season opener against the Arizona Cardinals and had seven carries for 50 yards in the 17–10 victory. He scored his first professional touchdown on a two-yard rush against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 4. He saw an increased role toward the end of the season. In Week 13 against the 49ers, he had 26 carries for 119 yards for his first 100+-yard game. In Week 16, against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had his best performance of the season with 24 carries for 148 yards and a touchdown. As a rookie, he rushed 134 times for 673 rushing yards and four touchdowns, and had 19 receptions for 189 yards.

====2005 season====
With Faulk aging, Jackson was named the Rams&#x27; starting running back for the 2005 season. In Week 4, against the New York Giants, he had his first receiving touchdown on a 13-yard pass from Marc Bulger. In Week 7, against the New Orleans Saints, he had his first multi-touchdown game with two rushing in the 28–17 victory. In Week 8, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he had 25 carries for 179 rushing yards to go with two receptions for 21 yards and receiving touchdown. Jackson had 1,046 rushing yards and eight rushing touchdowns on 254 attempts, and caught 43 passes for 320 yards and two receiving touchdowns.

====2006 season====
After the dismissal of head coach Mike Martz and the departure of Faulk, 2006 became Jackson&#x27;s breakout season. With Scott Linehan as the new head coach, the Rams had a more balanced offensive attack. He started the season off strong with 121 rushing yards in an 18–10 victory over the Denver Broncos. After rushing for 103 yards in Week 2 against the San Francisco 49ers, Jackson did not top 100 rushing yards until later in the season. However, there was a four-game stretch where he scored a rushing touchdown in each game from Week 6 to Week 10. In the second divisional game against the 49ers in Week 12, he had 121 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, nine receptions, and 71 receiving yards. He had 127 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns against the Oakland Raiders in Week 15. He had 150 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, six receptions, 102 receiving yards, and one receiving touchdown against the Washington Redskins in Week 16. He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for Week 16. He closed the year with 142 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns against the Minnesota Vikings in Week 17. For his productive end to the season, he was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December. Overall, Jackson ran 346 times for 1,528 yards and 13 rushing touchdowns and led all running backs when he caught 90 passes for 806 yards, and adding three receiving touchdowns. He led the NFL in total yards from scrimmage with 2,334. For his efforts, Jackson was named to his first Pro Bowl and received one vote for the 2006 NFL Offensive Player of the Year award.

====2007 season====

Jackson started the 2007 season with 58 rushing yards in a 27–17 loss to the Carolina Panthers. In Week 3, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he had 30 carries for 115 rushing yards. In Week 15, against the Green Bay Packers, he had a season-high 143 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown. During the Rams&#x27; dismal 2007 season, Jackson lashed out at fans and expressed distaste with the music played in the Edward Jones Dome. Overall, he finished the 2007 season with 1,002 rushing yards, five rushing touchdowns, 38 receptions, 271 receiving yards, and one receiving touchdown.

====2008 season====
After the season, with one year left on his rookie contract, Jackson believed he was underpaid and held out of training camp. On August 21, 2008, Jackson officially ended his holdout by signing a six-year contract worth a maximum of $49.3 million, including a $11.4 million signing bonus and $21 million guaranteed. Because the final two years of the deal (2012 and 2013) can be voided based on Jackson&#x27;s performance, it could become a three-year extension worth $29.3 million instead. Either way, signing the contract made him the highest-paid running back in the NFL. In Week 7, against the Dallas Cowboys, he had 25 carries for 160 yards and three rushing touchdowns. His performance against the Cowboys gave him his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week award. He closed out the season with 161 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns against the Atlanta Falcons. Overall, he finished the 2008 season with 253 carries for 1,042 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns to go with 40 receptions for 379 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown.

====2009 season====
After recording 67 rushing yards in a 28–0 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the season opener, Jackson had 104 rushing yards against the Washington Redskins in a 9–7 loss and 117 rushing yards against the Green Bay Packers in a 36–17 loss. In Week 7, against the Indianapolis Colts, he started a four-game stretch with over 100 rushing yards in each game with a rushing touchdown in the latter three against the Detroit Lions, New Orleans Saints, and the Arizona Cardinals. Overall, he finished the season with 1,416 rushing yards, four rushing touchdowns, 51 receptions, and 322 receiving yards. He was named to his second Pro Bowl.

====2010 season====
Jackson started the 2010 season with 81 rushing yards in a 17–13 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. He rushed for over 100 in three consecutive games against the Detroit Lions, San Diego Chargers, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Jackson surpassed Eric Dickerson as the Rams&#x27; all-time leading rusher, with a 110-yard effort against the Buccaneers game. On November 21, 2010, he recorded his 10,000th career yard from scrimmage on a first quarter run against the Atlanta Falcons. Jackson rushed for 1,145 yards during the 2011 regular season, marking the seventh consecutive season he has surpassed 1,000 yards. He earned his third Pro Bowl nomination for the 2010 season. He was ranked 38th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.

====2011 season====
Jackson started the 2011 season with two carries for 56 yards and a rushing touchdown against the Philadelphia Eagles. In Week 8, against the New Orleans Saints, he had 25 carries for 159 yards and two touchdowns. He followed that up with 130 rushing yards against the Arizona Cardinals and 128 rushing yards against the Cleveland Browns. Overall, Jackson recorded 1,145 rushing yards, five rushing touchdowns, 42 receptions, 333 receiving yards, and one receiving touchdown. He was ranked 37th by this fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.

====2012 season====
The 2012 draft saw the Rams select two running backs, Daryl Richardson and Isaiah Pead, indicating a potential future running back by committee scenario. With the retirement of LaDainian Tomlinson, Jackson became the NFL&#x27;s active leader in career rushing yards, where he remained for over three years until passed by Frank Gore in October 2015. In Week 12, against the Arizona Cardinals, he had a season-high 139 rushing yards. In Week 15, Jackson became the 27th running back in NFL history to rush for over 10,000 yards, and the sixth running back in league history to compile eight consecutive 1,000-yard rushing seasons. Jackson ended the 2012 season with 1,042 yards rushing and four touchdowns. At the conclusion of the season, Jackson chose to opt-out of the final year of his contract, to pursue a starting job on a contender.

===Atlanta Falcons===

On March 14, 2013, Jackson signed a three-year contract with the Atlanta Falcons. Jackson failed to rush for 1,000 yards for the first time since his rookie season in 2004, finishing the 2013 season with 543 rushing yards on 157 attempts. He had two games on the season with two rushing touchdowns, against the Buffalo Bills and Washington Redskins. In the 2014 season, Jackson&#x27;s rushing numbers improved with 707 rushing yards in 15 games. Jackson was released by the Falcons on February 26, 2015.

=== New England Patriots ===
On December 21, 2015, Jackson signed with the New England Patriots. He scored his first touchdown of the season in the Patriots&#x27; 20–10 loss to the Miami Dolphins on January 3. He scored his first career playoff touchdown in the AFC Championship 20–18 loss to the Denver Broncos. The loss to the Broncos ended up being Jackson&#x27;s final professional game.

===Retirement===
On July 29, 2019, Jackson signed a ceremonial one-day contract with the by-then Los Angeles Rams to officially retire as a member of the team.

Jackson was inducted into the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame in 2024.

<doc id="1242368" wikidata="Q7986517" url="?curid=1242368" title="West Side Nut Club Fall Festival">
<text>The West Side Nut Club Fall Festival is an annual event held the first full week of every October on Franklin Street in Evansville, Indiana, and is organized by the West Side Nut Club. The festival features over 137 food booths run and operated by not-for-profit groups in the region. It features an eclectic variety of food, particularly both traditional and unique fried food. The festival also includes numerous forms of entertainment, carnival attractions, amateur talent competitions, and a parade. 

==Attendance==

In 2014, festival chairman Tom Moore, had estimated that 30,000 people visit the festival a day, with other members estimating 70,000 on the busiest days. In 2023, the West Side Nutclub had estimated 200,000 people had visited the festival leading up to the weeks end, with around 15,000 to 40,000 visiting a day. Although he lacked statistics to support his claim, radio host Paul Harvey once called it the second-largest street festival in the U.S. in terms of attendees, behind only the New Orleans Mardi Gras. It is important to note that New Orleans Mardi Gras is not a street festival. The closest comparisons are New York City&#x27;s street festivals, such as the Atlantic Antic, New York&#x27;s Village Halloween Parade, and Taste of Buffalo festivals.

==History==

After three successful years of holding Halloween type Festivals, a handful of West Side businessmen decided, in 1921, to form an organization that would handle the duties of putting together successful Fall Festivals and “to initiate, promote, and support any and all movements which are for the betterment of the West Side of Evansville, Indiana; also for the betterment of Evansville as a whole.” The first West Side Nut Club Fall Festival was billed as a Halloween Night, Halloween Carnival, and masked ball. The event was a one night affair and consisted of a parade of costumed people followed by a Halloween Mask Ball. The crowd was estimated at 25,000.

After the first Festival, the Nut Club continued with the one or two night affairs until after World War II. During most of those Festivals, the Nut Club coordinated the decorations, agricultural exhibits, and parades while the Burdette Post of the American Legion sponsored street dances. In 1940, organizers incorporated three rides (Ferris wheel, merry-go-round &amp; mini autos) and an exhibit of caged animals, concessions, and circus acts. In 1942 the rides were moved to the library park on Franklin Street.

Due to World War II, the Festival was halted from 1943 to 1945. In 1946, the festival commenced again and for the first time extended most of the week from Monday through Saturday. During the 1950s the festival experienced substantial growth. Non-profit organizations began selling food in booths on Franklin Street. In 1952, Howell Baptist Church put up its first booth which, according to church sources, served the festival&#x27;s first Pronto Pups. The 1950s also ushered in larger rides and more well known entertainers.

2020 marked the first cancellation in 75 years. The next year will be its centennial anniversary, its 97th overall. Instead they just held a half-pot drawing.

The Nut Club holds a half-pot drawing each year during the fall festival since 2019. 2022&#x27;s half-pot was the largest to date with a total pot of $1.64 million. 

==Traditions==
===Entertainment===
The Fall Festival commences on a Sunday and runs all week. Each day includes several music and dance performances by local bands and youth. Saturday, the last day of the festival, is marked by a large parade. The parade is large and draws substantial crowds each year. In 2016, Evansville native Lilly King, a two-time Olympic Gold medalist in the same year, asked to be grand marshal of the parade; the request was granted. King noted, &quot;When you make the Olympic team you get to grand marshal the Fall Festival parade . Fall Festival is a holiday. It’s my favorite holiday. As a Westsider, I have to love Fall Festival.&quot;

=== Fried brain sandwich ===
The fair features fried brain sandwiches, a local speciality consisting of battered and deep fried calf or pig brains served on a bun.

<doc id="1242373" wikidata="Q2823917" url="?curid=1242373" title="Adam Archuleta">
<text>Adam Jason Archuleta (born November 27, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a safety for seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Arizona State Sun Devils, and was selected in the first round of the 2001 NFL draft by the St. Louis Rams with the 20th overall pick.

After five seasons with the Rams, Archuleta played a season each for the Washington Redskins and Chicago Bears, and was in camp with the Oakland Raiders in 2008.

==Early life==
Born in Rock Springs, Wyoming, Archuleta attended Chandler High School in Chandler, Arizona, a suburb southeast of Phoenix. He was a letterman in football in which he was a two-time first-team All-Central Region honoree and a two-time All-State Honorable Mention honoree. Jerry Loper was his high school head football coach.

==College career==
Archuleta played college football at nearby Arizona State University, where he started three years as a linebacker. Initially without a scholarship, he redshirted as a true freshman in 1996 after making the team as a walk-on.

Archuleta played in every game during his redshirt freshman season in 1997 as a reserve inside linebacker, recording 17 tackles (11 solos) while appearing mostly on special teams.

He moved into the starting lineup as a sophomore at weakside linebacker, playing in every game in 1998 and finished with 75 tackles (39 solos), five sacks and 18 stops for losses. As a junior in 1999, he was named to the All-Pac-10 Conference First Team as well as team most valuable player. He started the final eleven games at weakside outside linebacker and led the team with 111 tackles (59 solos) with five sacks and 21 stops for losses.

As a senior in 2000, he was named the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year and was a First-team All-Pac-10 Conference selection as a linebacker. He also was one of three finalists for the Butkus Award, given annually to the top linebacker in college football. As a senior, he started at weakside outside linebacker and led ASU with a career-high 127 tackles (93 solos) with four sacks and 15 stops for losses. He was a First-team All-America selection by The Sports Xchange and earned Second-team All-American from the Walter Camp Foundation.

During his four-year career Archuleta ranks fourth in school history with 54 stops behind the line of scrimmage while recording 330 tackles (202 solos) with 14 quarterback sacks, six fumble recoveries and five forced fumbles.

==Professional career==
===Pre-draft===
===St. Louis Rams===
The St. Louis Rams drafted Archuleta in the first round with the 20th overall selection in the 2001 NFL draft. He spent his first five years in St. Louis, where he excelled in Lovie Smith&#x27;s Cover 2 base defense. He signed a five-year $7 million contract with the Rams, with a signing bonus of $3 million.

In 2001 Archuleta was named to All-rookie teams by The Football News and Pro Football Weekly after playing in 13 games and starting 12 at strong safety. He finished sixth on the Rams with 81 tackles (43 solo) and tied for second with seven tackles for loss while notching two sacks, five passes defensed, two forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. In 2002, he started all 16 contests, 15 at strong safety, one at weakside linebacker and he led team with 149 tackles (101 solo) with 2.5 sacks, one interception, four passes defensed, three QB pressures, one fumble recovery, three tackles for loss, and eight special teams tackles. In 2003, he started 13 games at strong safety and had his second consecutive 100-plus tackle season, collecting 101 stops (77 solo) and had five sacks, five tackles for loss, one interception, eight passes defensed, nine QB pressures, one forced fumble, and one fumble recovery. His Five sacks led all NFL defensive backs in 2003, was the most sacks by an NFL defensive back since 2000. He was also named NFC Defensive Player of the Month for November 2003.

In 2004 Archuleta played in all 16 regular season games, starting 14, and started both playoff games despite being hampered by a back injury. He had his third consecutive 100-plus tackle season, collecting 123 tackles (73 solo) and had two sacks, five tackles for loss, three passes defensed, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, and nine special teams tackles. He earned Co-&quot;Horse Trailer Player of the Game&quot; honors (along with Torry Holt) for his performance on Monday Night Football vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 10/18, as he collected six tackles (three solo) and forced Bucs&#x27; RB Michael Pittman to fumble, recovering the fumble, and returned it 93 yards for a touchdown. Had 10 tackles (six solo), and earned NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors with two solo special teams tackles vs. Seattle Seahawks November 14, 2004. In 2005 Archuleta appeared in and started 14 games and collected 93 tackles (66 solo), 3.5 sacks, five pass deflections and one interception. In Week 3 against the Tennessee Titans, he intercepted a pass and returned it 85 yards for a touchdown. He also recorded six tackles, all solo, in that game. A month later, in Week 7 vs. New Orleans Saints, he recorded two sacks, seven tackles (six solo) and logged a fumble recovery.

===Washington Redskins===
After the 2005 season ended, he was one of the most sought after free agent safeties. The Redskins made him the highest paid safety, up to that point, in NFL history by signing Archuleta to a six-year, $30 million contract (with approximately $10 million guaranteed) on March 14, 2006 Archuleta started at strong safety for 7 of 16 games played with the Redskins, registering 50 tackles and one sack to go along with career-high 17 special teams tackles. He appeared in all 16 regular season contests for the third time in his career, registering a sack for sixth consecutive season, the longest active streak for an NFL safety. However, after struggles in the deep passing game for the Redskins, Archuleta was replaced at the strong safety position with Troy Vincent, and played only on special teams the last half of the season. On December 28, 2006, Archuleta expressed his displeasure with the way the Redskins were using him, and the lack of communication from the coaching staff, under head coach Joe Gibbs.

===Chicago Bears===
On March 20, 2007, the Redskins traded Archuleta to the Chicago Bears for their sixth round selection in the upcoming 2007 NFL draft. The Bears agreed to pay him $8.1 million over three years. Archuleta was reunited with Lovie Smith, but never lived up to the expectations the team had for him during the 2007 season. Archuleta played 15 games with only ten starts and he intercepted a pass, forced a fumble and recovered a fumble. He knocked down three passes and had 61 tackles, numbers that were below his career averages. The Bears released him on May 6, 2008. In his season with the Bears, Archuleta was paid $5.1 million of his contract, which the Bears picked up from the Redskins.

===Oakland Raiders===
On August 11, 2008, the Oakland Raiders signed Archuleta with the intention of moving him to linebacker. He was released on August 30 in final roster cuts, to comply with the 53-man roster requirement.

==Post NFL==
Archuleta is a local and national sports commentator for ESPN and Fox, and was inducted into ASU&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2011.

Archuleta joined the new Pac-12 Network in 2012 as a game analyst for college football telecasts. After one season Archuleta joined CBS Sports Network as an analyst for Conference USA and Mountain West Conference games; despite declining to play for the UFL, he did call the league&#x27;s games when they aired on CBS Sports Network in 2012. He also joined the NFL on CBS in 2013 as a game analyst alongside Andrew Catalon, in 2014-16 alongside Tom McCarthy, in 2021–22 with Greg Gumbel, and in 2017–19, and 2023 alongside Spero Dedes, replacing Randy Cross.

As of the 2023 season, Archuleta is partnered with Spero Dedes.

==NFL statistics==
==Personal life==
Archuleta married &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate Jennifer Walcott in 2010. They had their first child, a son, on April 10, 2008. The family was featured on an episode of &quot;Football Wives&quot; on E! True Hollywood Story in 2009. He was also featured in &quot;Moves&quot; magazine alongside his wife, Jennifer.

<text>Wilhelm Orlik-Rückemann (1894–1986) was a Polish general, military commander and one of the pioneers of armoured warfare in Poland.

==Early life==
Wilhelm Orlik-Rückemann was born on 1 August 1894 in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary (later Lwów, Poland, and today Lviv, Ukraine.) In 1912 he started studies at the Road and Bridge Engineering faculty of the Lwów University of Technology. His studies, however, were halted by the outbreak of World War I. In 1914 Orlik-Rückemann volunteered for the Polish Legions, where he served with distinction at various command posts in the 6th Infantry Regiment. After the &quot;oath crisis&quot; of 1917 he was drafted to the Austro-Hungarian Army, where he served with the 19th Rifle Regiment. In 1918 he also graduated from the Infantry Reserve Officer&#x27;s School.

==Polish Army==
On 4 November 1918, he joined the Polish Army. During the Polish-Ukrainian War of 1919 he was taken prisoner by the Ukrainians, but was later released after Piłsudski signed an alliance with Semen Petlura. Orlik-Rückemann was then sent to armoured forces school and was given the command of a small tank unit equipped entirely with French FT-17 tanks. During the Polish-Bolshevik War he became one of the most successful tank commanders of the Polish forces and during the Battle of Warsaw on 16 August 1920 he was promoted to colonel and given the command of the 1st Tank Regiment.

After the war Orlik-Rückemann remained in the Polish Army and until 1 May 1927 was the commanding officer of the 1st Tank Regiment. He also graduated from the faculty of tank combat commanders of the Ecole Superieure de Guerre in Paris. After liquidation of his unit, Orlik-Rückemann was transferred to the Ministry of War Affairs and then in January 1928 became the deputy commanding officer of the 23rd Infantry Division.

On 27 February 1932 Orlik-Rückemann became the commanding officer of the 9th Infantry Division and the following year was promoted to brigadier general. In December 1938 he became the deputy commander of the elite Border Defence Corps and on 8 August 1939 became its commander.

==World War II==
Shortly before the start of World War II Orlik-Rückemann&#x27;s forces were deprived of most of the reserves that were transferred to western Poland to strengthen the Polish units stationed there. After the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War of 1939 and the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Poland on 17 September, Orlik-Rückemann&#x27;s forces could offer only a token resistance against the overwhelming odds. To prevent the complete destruction of his forces, Orlik-Rückemann decided to withdraw them from the 300 kilometre long border in the area of Polesie and break through to Warsaw and the forces of Polesie Independent Operational Group under general Franciszek Kleeberg.

Until 22 September he gathered approximately 8,000 men and started his march towards Warsaw. Constant skirmishes with the Red Army and the Fifth column brought down the morale of his men. To counter the threat of a breakdown, Orlik-Rückemann decided to start a major battle with the Red Army. During the Battle of Szack, on 28 September, his men managed to rout the Soviet 52nd Rifle Division. On 30 September the unit crossed the Bug river and reached the village of Wytyczno, some 20 kilometres south-east of Włodawa. The Battle of Wytyczno started the following day, when his unit was attacked by the Soviet 45th Rifle Division, reinforced with tanks and artillery. After 15 hours of heavy fighting, the supplies of the Polish forces were almost depleted and Orlik-Rückemann decided to divide his unit into small groups and order them to break through to the area occupied by the Independent Operational Group Polesie on their own. Most of the Polish forces reached their destination unopposed and with negligible losses.

After the end of hostilities in Poland, Orlik-Rückemann managed to evade being captured and crossed the Lithuanian border. From there he managed to get to Sweden and by the end of October he was in the United Kingdom. There he served in the Polish Army in exile on various staff posts.

==After World War II==
Between 1945 and 1947 he was working for the Polish Resettlement Corps. He was deprived of Polish citizenship by the communist authorities of Poland and remained in exile. Initially he lived in London and in 1972 he moved to his family to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Wilhelm Orlik-Rückemann died on October 18, 1986, in Ottawa.

<doc id="1242377" wikidata="Q5537413" url="?curid=1242377" title="George Bulman (fictional character)">
<text>Detective Sergeant George Kitchener Bulman was a fictional detective created by Kenneth Royce in his series of books about The XYY Man (semi-reformed cat burglar Spider Scott), where the character&#x27;s name was initially Alf Bulman. Here Bulman is presented as a &#x27;bent copper&#x27;, though the only examples of his corruption given are that he gained promotion to sergeant by persuading down-and-outs to confess to unsolved robberies, in return for a prison sentence which would put them inside during the coldest months of winter.

==Television appearances==
These books were turned into a Granada TV series in the mid-1970s, with actor Don Henderson playing Bulman, Scott&#x27;s nemesis. Bulman lives only for the day that he can put Scott (played on TV by Stephen Yardley) back behind bars, but he and his sidekick Detective Constable Derek Willis (Dennis Blanch) are thwarted every time, even gaining some slight sympathy and respect for Scott as they discover how he and they have been used by the secret service. Bulman was originally portrayed as mildly eccentric, wearing woollen gloves, using a nasal inhaler and trying to &#x27;better&#x27; himself by engaging in further education (showing off his learning with a pretentious erudition which makes him look foolish).

The Bulman character proved popular with viewers, and, with Willis, was given a spin-off series &quot;Strangers&quot;, which saw the formerly London-based detectives transferred to the north-west of England. During the five-year run of &quot;Strangers&quot;, Bulman&#x27;s eccentricities were increased, and included such traits as a propensity for keeping his belongings in plastic carrier bags and his keeping of a pet hamster named Flash Gordon. His middle name was revealed to be Kitchener. Increasingly his erudition was used less to make him look pretentious and a joke figure, but instead underlined a zen-like wisdom and otherworldliness. He also leapt in rank, gaining a double-promotion from Detective Sergeant to Detective Chief Inspector in one bound.

In the mid-80s the character returned in &quot;Bulman&quot;. Disillusioned, Bulman leaves the police to work as a private investigator while making a living repairing clocks. He kept a model railway layout in his office, and wore a &#x27;Will Power&#x27; T-Shirt, bearing an illustration of William Shakespeare. Mirroring in some ways the post-prison career of Spider Scott, Bulman and his assistant Lucy McGinty (Siobhan Redmond) were often coerced or tricked into doing clandestine and dangerous work for the secret service.

==Literary return==
Kenneth Royce returned to his Bulman character at the height of the show&#x27;s success, writing two more XYY Man novels (&quot;The Crypto Man&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Mosley Receipt&quot; (1985)) and a Bulman novel, &quot;No Way Back (Hashimi&#x27;s Revenge)&quot; in 1986. In the 90s he followed this with &quot;The Judas Trail&quot; (1996) and &quot;Shadows&quot; (1996). By this point, Royce&#x27;s Bulman differs from the television version considerably - his is called Alfred George Bulman (the TV one is George Kitchener Bulman), and by &quot;The Crypto Man&quot; in 1985 has risen to be a Detective Superintendent in the Security Services section of the Metropolitan Police (his TV alternative never made it above Detective Chief Inspector before becoming a private investigator).

Granada ended the series in 1987. Henderson obtained the rights for TV use of the character, but became busy with other projects and died in 1997 before he was able to interest producers in any new series.

==List of television appearances==
*&quot;The XYY Man&quot; (1976–77) 13 episodes
*&quot;Strangers&quot; (1978–82) 32 episodes

<text>Game Network was a European free-to-air television channel. It was initially owned by Digital Bros group, and later taken over by Cellcast Group. It was first launched in 1999.

==History==
Game Network first broadcast in Italy on 17 September 1999. The channel was available throughout Southern Europe, and developed, attracting an estimated audience of 300,000. It launched in the United Kingdom in May 2001 on Sky EPG number 223. At its UK launch, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; evaluated the channel&#x27;s free-to-air business proposition, commenting that its potential viewers should be abundant with consideration to the surge of popularity of video games at the time, noting the rising popularity of video games, the release of hundreds of titles in the UK each year and the launch of the PlayStation 2 months earlier. The channel was expected to provide 24-hour television dedicated to video games and earn money from advertising and sponsorship.

The UK version of the television channel, produced by Cellcast included regional content with programs such as Digital Crack, Me in Mir, The Weekly Chart Show, Game Guru, Reloaded, LiveWire, and Evolution. In 2003, Cellcast started increasing control of the channel, with Sem Mioli of Digital Bros. side and Jonathan French and Craig Gardiner from the Cellcast side spearheading the channel) with the launch of non-gaming programmes such as &quot;Babestation&quot;, a late-night &quot;tease&quot; show. The success of this show lead to many other clone programmes appearing on other channels, and this alternative revenue stream lead to a later influx of phone-in quiz shows, of which Game Network shows many. By 2005, Game Network&#x27;s UK games programming went largely limited to a block of raw games footage from 5:30 am – 10am, with Game Guru airing from 5 pm until 7 pm, followed by programmes such as &quot;Psychic Interactive&quot;, which continue until &quot;Babestation&quot; starts.

&quot;Game Guru&quot; relaunched on 20 September, 2004 with interactive features, including live chat and MMS picture messaging.

In 2004, the channel&#x27;s Sky EPG number was 172.

In 2005, Charlie Brooker writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted the incongruity of the channel&#x27;s programming, with clairvoyance programme &quot;Psychic Interactive&quot; being, &quot;interrupted every few minutes by an &quot;ad break&quot; largely consisting of stills of Pac Man accompanied by captions in Italian, or Mortal Kombat characters backed with heavy metal music&quot;.

The major gaming shows, such as &quot;LiveWire&quot;, were cancelled in May 2005, and the Italian-language feed from Hot Bird ceased on September 17, 2005, after six years on air. At this time, Digital Bros. sold Game Network UK completely to Cellcast Group, which completely dropped all video game content by 20 February 2006 and renamed it &quot;Babestation&quot;. On 28 February, the channel was moved to the adult section of the Sky EPG.

<text>Zeng Jinlian (, 26 June 1964 – 13 February 1982) was a Chinese teenage girl who is the tallest woman verified in modern times, surpassing Jane Bunford&#x27;s record. Following the death of Don Koehler, Zeng was the tallest living person from 1981 to 1982, during which time she surpassed fellow &quot;eight-footers&quot; Gabriel Estêvão Monjane and Suleiman Ali Nashnush.

== Biography ==
Zeng was born on 26 June 1964 in Yuanjiang, Hunan, to a poor farming family, as the youngest of four children, growing up in Nanzui Town by Muping Lake. Her parents Zeng Xianmao and Yu Xuemei were 163 cm (5 ft 4.2 in) and 156 cm (5 ft 1.4 in) respectively, with all her siblings being in within similar height range, with a brother being measured at 158 cm (5 ft 2 in) at age 18. According to the family genealogy, however, Zeng had a great-granduncle who was recorded at 233 cm (7 ft 7 in) in height.

The cause of Zeng&#x27;s gigantism was a tumor that caused her pituitary gland to overproduce human growth hormone. Her abnormal height development started when she was four months old. Zeng outgrew her mother by age five and at age 13, she stood 232 cm (7 ft 7.5 in), taller than the tallest man Robert Wadlow was at the same age, at 224 cm (7 ft 4 in). Zeng still attended school, starting at age 7 and graduating in 1980.

At age 16, Zeng was measured at 240 cm (7 ft 10.5 in) and weighed 147 kg (324 lbs) during a routine medical check for her diabetes and only months later within the same year, she overtook then-record holder Jane Bunford in height. Doctors proposed brain surgery to remove the tumor, but Zeng declined due to fear of medical intervention and a desire to keep her hair. By this point, Zeng had garnered regional prominence for her unusual stature, which led to visitors regularly coming to her home to meet her, almost a hundred on a single day during visiting peak. The local government provided Zeng with a yearly payment equivalent to US$670 () to cover some of her living expenses. While she and her family mostly subsisted off of fish from the nearby lake, Zeng reportedly ate 20 dumplings for breakfast and six bowls of rice with vegetables for dinner each day, consuming around 500 kg (1102 lbs) of food each year.

Zeng was generally described as being shy and reserved, but noted to have a passion for literature such as magazines and detective novels, as well as sports, particularly basketball, though she eventually stopped due to developing scoliosis related to her increasing height. She and her family noted that in addition to her long length of limbs, with her hands measuring 25.5 cm (10 in) and her feet 35.5 cm (1 ft 2 in) in length, Zeng was also physically strong, having reportedly been able to carry a bag of cement weighing 48 kg (108 lbs) at age four. She remained at home following the end of her school attendance due to her diabetes. To accommodate her great height, Zeng&#x27;s family were contracted with local tailors and factories to manufacture several of her items custom-made, including her shirts, pants, shoes, chairs and bed, which measured 274 cm (9 ft) in length.

Zeng became known outside of China following her introduction in the Chinese health press. In interviews, Zeng voiced her appreciation for her friends and neighbors for treating her kindly and commented that despite her fame, she did not intend to leave her rural home county and planned to stay in the countryside for the rest of her life.

In March 1981, Zeng&#x27;s issues with scoliosis and diabetes worsened. Because the curvature of her spine prevented Zeng from standing up straight, the Guinness World Records did not recognize Zeng as the world&#x27;s tallest standing woman when they considered her for entry in 1981; Zeng&#x27;s back problems eventually left her unable to walk and rely on a wheelchair for mobility.

== Death ==
Zeng died from complications of diabetes on 13 February 1982 in Yuanjiang while in hospital care, where she had been since December 1981. With her death, American woman Sandy Allen, standing 232 cm (7 ft 7 in) officially became the tallest living woman, while Mozambican Gabriel Estêvão Monjane became the tallest living person. Attending doctors reported that during her three month stay, Zeng had still been growing. 

It is theorized that Zeng would have potentially outgrown Robert Wadlow, as she stood taller than Wadlow when comparing the heights taken on their 17th birthdays, though Wadlow&#x27;s height at that age is usually reported as the one measured on his high school graduation, when he was only one month away from his 18th birthday.

<text>Michael McMahon ( ; born 1954) is a British comics artist best known for his work on &quot;2000 AD&quot; characters such as &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, &quot;Sláine&quot; and &quot;ABC Warriors&quot;, and the mini-series &quot;The Last American&quot;.

His influences include Víctor de la Fuente, Hugo Pratt, Gino d&#x27;Antonio, Don Lawrence, Joe Colquhoun and Harvey Kurtzman.


== Career ==
&quot;Judge Dredd&quot; was created for IPC&#x27;s new science fiction comic &quot;2000 AD&quot; in 1977 by writer John Wagner and artist Carlos Ezquerra, but problems in pre-publication led to both creators walking out, and the first published story was written by Peter Harris and Pat Mills, and drawn by an inexperienced young artist called Mike McMahon. Mills, who was editor at the time, chose McMahon because he could do a passable imitation of Ezquerra&#x27;s style, but the more he drew the more his own style emerged. When Wagner returned to his creation, McMahon became the character&#x27;s most regular artist. Other artists, such as Ian Gibson and Brian Bolland, followed his lead, putting their own spin on the way McMahon was developing the character and his world.

McMahon&#x27;s early work was characterised by a quick, spontaneous approach that verged on the messy. His figures were lean and loose, his pen lines thrown down with verve and energy, and hatching was done with a fully charged brush. He drew the bulk of the first long-form &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; story, &quot;The Cursed Earth&quot;, with the slower, more meticulous Brian Bolland contributing occasional episodes.

In 1979 McMahon took some time off from Dredd to draw Pat Mills&#x27;s robot disaster squad &quot;Ro-Busters&quot; and its spin-off &quot;ABC Warriors&quot;, alternating with Kevin O&#x27;Neill and others, and under O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s influence his work became tighter and his figures chunkier. He returned to Dredd the following year for the next long story, &quot;The Judge Child&quot;, with a different, more considered style, and rotated with Bolland and Ron Smith. Writers John Wagner and Alan Grant gave McMahon the spookier, more atmospheric episodes to draw.

Following &quot;The Judge Child&quot; his art took a high contrast black and white direction, and in colour stories in annuals, explored patterns of flat colour. In 1981, when he began the &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; story &quot;Block Mania&quot;, which he was slated to draw all nine episodes of, his drawings were tight and precise with well-defined areas of black and white. They were taking an increasingly long time to draw, especially with all the crowd scenes the scripts called for, and McMahon bowed out after only two episodes.

McMahon moved to Mills&#x27; new Celtic barbarian fantasy, &quot;Sláine&quot;, another story with a fraught pre-publication history, and all but disappeared from publication for nearly two years (He did draw a couple of stories for &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; during this time). When he did return in 1983, it was with a radically different style, all sinuous figures, tangled pen lines, and incompletely filled in areas of black. Freed from sterile science fiction environments, he went to town on texture and tone, lashed together technology and organic backgrounds.

After his last work on &quot;Sláine&quot; in 1984, McMahon re-emerged in 1991, after a long illness that prevented him from drawing, with &quot;The Last American&quot;, written by Wagner and Grant, for Marvel Comics&#x27;s Epic imprint, and another radical change in drawing style.

Since then he has worked in computer game design and his work in comics has been sporadic. A couple of &quot;Hellraiser&quot; stories, an &quot;Alien Legion&quot; one-off, the unfinished &quot;Mutomaniac&quot; in the short-lived weekly &quot;Toxic!&quot;, a handful of &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;-related stories, and a futuristic Batman story in &quot;Legends of the Dark Knight&quot;, saw him progressively simplify and flatten his style, then find new ways of introducing depth in &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot;, the miniseries &quot;Tattered Banners&quot; for DC Comics&#x27;s Vertigo imprint, a return to &quot;ABC Warriors&quot; and a short &quot;Batman Black and White&quot; back-up story. During this time, he also produced two 6 page strips for the Marvel UK/Panini fully originated fortnightly comic &quot;Rugrats&quot; (he would have been commissioned to draw more, but the comic was canceled). His latest work, a Judge Dredd episode, appeared in &quot;2000 AD&quot; #1539.

In 2011-2012 McMahon drew &quot;Tank Girl - Carioca&quot;, a six-part mini series with &quot;Tank Girl&quot; co-creator to Alan Martin for Titan Books.

<doc id="1242402" wikidata="Q116169" url="?curid=1242402" title="Philolaus (crater)">
<text>Philolaus is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It lies within one crater diameter to the east-southeast of the flooded crater Anaximenes, and to the west of the smaller Anaxagoras. It overlies the older and heavily worn Philolaus C to the south.

This crater retains a well-defined form that has not changed significantly since it was originally created. The outer rim edge is roughly circular, but with a somewhat irregular edge that displays signs of slumping. The most notable slump is a triangular area along the eastern rim. The inner wall of the crater has a complex system of s with a sharp-edged rim in locations where slumping has occurred. On the exterior of the rim is an outer that extends outwards for nearly half a crater diameter in all directions. The crater has a ray system, and is consequently mapped as part of the Copernican System.

The interior floor is irregular with rough areas about the center and to the northeast. There is no single central peak, but rather a pair of peaks offset to the south and the east of the middle. There is also a smaller ridge pair offset to the northwest. The flattest part of the interior floor is in the northeast of the crater interior. The floor is not significantly marked by impacts.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Philolaus.

<text>Randy Montez McMichael (born June 28, 1979) is an American former professional football tight end in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the fourth round of the 2002 NFL draft. He played college football at Georgia.

==Early life==
McMichael was named to the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;s Top 50 in the state of Georgia at Peach County High School in Fort Valley, Georgia. He was voted the team&#x27;s best offensive lineman as a senior, and also lettered in basketball and track during his prep career.

==College career==
McMichael was a three-year letterman at Georgia from 1999 to 2001. He missed all but one game in 1997 with a thumb injury, and missed all of 1998 with a knee injury.

In 1999, he caught 34 passes for 357 yards and three touchdowns, earning First-team Freshman All-American honors from The Sporting News and SEC coaches. As a sophomore in 2000, McMichael hauled in 32 passes for 475 yards and a score, earning an honorable mention All-conference selection. He was a First-team All-SEC selection by the Associated Press and SEC coaches in his final year of 2001 when he started nine of the ten games in which he appeared and had 24 receptions for 281 yards and a touchdown.

McMichael started 21 of the 33 games in which he played during his career and caught 90 passes for 1,213 yards and five touchdowns. He finished ranked ninth in school history for career receiving yards.

==Professional career==

===Pre-draft figures===
===Miami Dolphins===
McMichael was selected in the fourth round (114th overall) in the 2002 NFL draft by the Miami Dolphins. The pick used by Dolphins to select him was originally acquired from the New Orleans Saints in the deal that sent running back Ricky Williams to the Miami Dolphins.

McMichael made his NFL debut in a starting role against the Detroit Lions on September 8, when he tied for team-lead with four receptions and led the team with 73 yards. He also scored his first NFL touchdown in the game, hauling in a Jay Fiedler pass from 16 yards out in the second quarter.

He started all 16 games in his rookie season, catching 39 passes for 485 yards and four touchdowns. His four receiving scores led the team, while his reception and yardage figures both were third. He became the first Dolphins rookie tight end ever to start every regular season contest. No Dolphins tight end had produced as many stats as McMichael had since Troy Drayton in 1997 (39 receptions, 558 yards, 4 touchdowns). McMichael&#x27;s four touchdown catches were the third-highest figure by a Dolphins rookie at any position, and the most by a tight end, surpassing Ferrell Edmunds, who had three in 1988. McMichael had a reception in 15 of 16 games. Of his 39 catches, five went for 25 yards or longer – third-most on the team, trailing only James McKnight (9) and Chris Chambers (7).

Although he was the eighth tight end taken in the 2002 NFL Draft, McMichael&#x27;s receiving totals ranked second among all NFL rookie tight ends in 2002, trailing only the New York Giants’ Jeremy Shockey – the 14th overall pick in the draft. McMichael&#x27;s touchdown total was also the most of any rookie tight end in the league in 2002.

McMichael emerged as one of the top receiving tight ends in the league in his second NFL season, starting all 16 games and finishing with 49 receptions for 598 yards and two touchdowns. He added another touchdown on a fumble recovery. McMichael ranked third on the team in receptions and second in receiving yards. He led or shared the team-lead in receiving four times during the course of the season, while topping the team in receiving yards on five occasions. Of his 49 receptions, five went for 25 yards or longer (second-most on the team) trailing only Chris Chambers (8). He had a reception in all but one game. He ranked fourth among AFC tight ends in both receptions and receiving yards.

McMichael had his most productive game of the season and one of the top receiving days ever by a Dolphins tight end against the New England Patriots on October 19, when he caught eight passes for 102 yards. His eight receptions tied a team record for a tight end at the time, achieved three times previously, most recently by Keith Jackson who did it in a Divisional Playoff game on January 8, 1995, at the San Diego Chargers.

For the third straight year, McMichael started all 16 games. He was one of only two Dolphins offensive players to open every game in 2004, with offensive lineman Seth McKinney being the other. McMichael put together the most prolific receiving season of any tight end in Dolphins history, leading the team with 73 receptions while his 791 receiving yards ranked second, trailing only Chris Chambers, who registered 898 yards. He also scored four touchdowns on the season and had a two-point conversion to his credit. He had five receptions for 25 yards or longer on the season, tied with Marty Booker for second on the squad, trailing only Chambers, who had six. Overall, McMichael led the Dolphins in receptions eight times and in receiving yards on seven occasions over the course of the season. His reception total ranked 13th in the AFC. He tied for fourth in the AFC with 24 third-down receptions. His 73 receptions and 791 receiving yards both represent single-season standards for a Dolphins tight end, as he surpassed the previous marks set by Keith Jackson in 1994. For his performance during the season, McMichael was a first-alternate for the AFC Pro Bowl squad.

In 2005, McMichael started 16 games for the fourth straight year to open his career. He ended 2005 having opened 64 consecutive contests. On the year, he caught 60 passes for 582 yards and five touchdowns. His reception total and five receiving scores ranked second on the squad, while his yardage figure was third. All three figures placed him fourth among AFC tight ends. His reception figure was the second-highest single-season total by a Dolphins tight end, while his five receiving scores tied for fourth and marked a personal single-season best. McMichael led the team in receptions on six occasions and in receiving yardage once. He had a touchdown reception in each of the first four games of the season -the only player in the NFL to achieve this feat in 2005.

On October 7, 2005, McMichael signed a four-year contract extension with the Dolphins to keep him with the team through the 2009 season. The four-year extension was worth slightly more than $18 million in &quot;new money&quot; and includes $8.92 million in bonuses. On average, it ranked slightly behind the deal signed by fellow tight end Todd Heap of the Baltimore Ravens around the same time.

The Dolphins&#x27; offense struggled as a whole in 2006, and like Chris Chambers, McMichael was not consistently and often utilized by quarterback Joey Harrington. For the season, McMichael finished second on the team in receptions with 62 catches for 640 yards and three touchdowns. In a three-game span (from October 8 through October 22) he totaled 21 catches for 233 yards. He finished fifth among AFC tight ends in receptions and was sixth in receiving yards. He led the team in receptions five times and in reception yardage four times during the season.

For the fifth straight year, McMichael started all 16 games of the season. Through 2006, McMichael played 80 career games without ever missing a start. At season&#x27;s end, McMichael was already the team&#x27;s all-time leading tight end in receptions and receiving yards, and ranked third in touchdowns.

The Dolphins released McMichael on March 5, 2007, in lieu of paying him a $3 million bonus due the following week.

===St. Louis Rams===
On March 8, 2007, the St. Louis Rams signed McMichael to a three-year, $11 million deal that includes a $3 million signing bonus. The deal reunited McMichael with Scott Linehan, the Dolphins&#x27; 2005 offensive coordinator and then head coach of the Rams. McMichael suffered a season-ending right tibia injury against Buffalo on September 8, 2008, and missed the rest of the 2008 NFL season, after posting 11 catches for 139 yards. The 2009 NFL season he played all 16 games, finishing with 34 catches for 332 yards and 1 touchdown.

===San Diego Chargers===
After his signing with the team in 2009, McMichael was mostly known for his blocking ability. On November 7, 2010, McMichael got his first start in two years due to star tight end Antonio Gates being injured in a game against the Houston Texans he caught two catches that went for touchdowns, San Diego went on to win 29–23.

On March 12, 2013, McMichael was cut by the Chargers.

==NFL career statistics==
=== Dolphins franchise records ===
* Most career receiving yards by a tight end — 3,096
* Most career receptions by a tight end — 283

==Radio career==

In May 2019, Randy McMichael began co-hosting a midday program with Andy Bunker on sports-talk &quot;92.9 The Game&quot; WZGC in Atlanta. He also hosts the station&#x27;s Saturday morning &quot;College Game Time&quot; program.

<doc id="1242419" wikidata="Q3880875" url="?curid=1242419" title="Odinic Rite">
<text>The Odinic Rite (OR) is a reconstructionist religious organisation named after the god Odin. It conceives itself as a &quot;folkish&quot; Heathen movement concerned with Germanic paganism, mythology, folklore, and runes. As a white supremacist organization, the Odinic Rite limits membership to white individuals, holding the belief in Heathenry as the ancestral religion of the Indo-European race.

==Background==
The Odinic Rite refers to their form of Heathenry as &quot;Odinism&quot;, a term favoured among Heathen white supremacists. In 1841, the term was used by the Scottish writer, historian, and philosopher, Thomas Carlyle in his book, &quot;On Heroes, Hero-Worship, &amp; the Heroic in History&quot;: &quot;Odinism was Valour; Christianism was humility, a nobler kind of Valour.&quot; It was also used by Orestes Brownson in his 1848 &quot;Letter to Protestants&quot;.

The term was re-introduced in the late 1930s by Alexander Rud Mills, an Australian fascist. Having formulated &quot;his own unique blend&quot; of Ariosophy, Mills drew heavily on writings of pioneering Austrian Ariosophist and Wotanist Guido von List. Much of Mills&#x27; ideology focused around what he conceived as the &quot;British race&quot;, a group who he believed also inhabited not only Britain but other parts of the world colonised by the British Empire. That concept was particularly problematic given the ethnically and linguistically diverse nature of the British population during the early 20th century. Mills believed that while Christianity was alien to the &quot;British race&quot;, Odinism was &#x27;native&#x27; and thus could be better understood by them. He expressed the view that &quot;our own racial ideas and traditions (not those of others) are our best guide to health and national strength&quot;. He was critical of Christianity, believing it to be &quot;unnatural&quot; because – in his view – it encouraged the breaking down of racial barriers. In Mills&#x27; theology, the Norse gods were symbols of the divine rather than actual anthropomorphic entities, and he believed that each racial group had its own symbolic system for interpreting and understanding divinity. For Mills, Odin represented an archetypal father figure, with other deities from Norse mythology, such as Thor and Frigg, having minor roles.

==History==
In 1973 John Gibbs-Bailey (known as &quot;Hoskuld&quot;) and John Yeowell (known as &quot;Stubba&quot;, 1918–2010) founded the &quot;Committee for the Restoration of the Odinic Rite&quot; or &quot;Odinist Committee&quot; in England. Yeowell had been a member of the British Union of Fascists in his youth and bodyguard to leader Oswald Mosley. In 1980 the organisation changed its name to &quot;The Odinic Rite&quot; after it was believed that it had gained enough significant interest in the restoration of the Odinic faith.

In 1989 Yeowell resigned as Director of the Odinic Rite&#x27;s governing body, the &quot;Court of Gothar&quot;. The Court then unanimously elected Jeffrey Holley (known as &quot;Heimgest&quot;) as its Director and he was officially installed in this position on 23 April 1989 at the White Horse Stone in Kent. He was professed by Freya Aswynn. Prior to his involvement with the Odinic Rite Heimgest had belonged to a small group known as the Heimdal League, a closed group which disbanded in the mid-1980s.

==Beliefs==
The Odinic Rite defines Odinism as the natural religion of the peoples of Northern Europe. It has been characterised as a white supremacist organisation and describes itself as a &quot;folkish&quot; group, which it states centres on a stance that includes &quot;racial preservation and promotion&quot;, and to &quot;have as many healthy children as is practical&quot;. It asserts that &quot;nationality is biological, not geographical&quot;, further stating that &quot;It is hardly possible to overestimate the damage that the destruction of racial and national identity has caused, to both people and the environment.&quot; 

They only allow white members and discourage mixed-race relationships, stating that while this was not a stance taken by heathens prior to Christianisation, this is a necessary precaution in the modern age to maintain &quot;racial integrity&quot; and to prevent &quot;crossed allegiances&quot;. The group further draws analogies between invasive species and immigrants, stating that the latter threaten the survival of the white population. It defines right and wrong as follows:

The Odinic Rite encourages its members to live their lives according to the &quot;Nine Noble Virtues&quot; and the &quot;Nine Charges&quot;. The list of noble virtues (Courage, Truth, Honour, Fidelity, Discipline, Hospitality, Self-Reliance, Industriousness, and Perseverance) is attributed to either John Yeowell (a.k.a. Stubba) and John Gibbs-Bailey (a.k.a. Hoskuld), members of Odinic Rite; or alternatively to Stephen Flowers (writing as &#x27;Edred Thorsson&#x27;), at the time member of the Asatru Free Assembly.

While the group nominally identifies as a religious organisation that is not political, the worldviews held by the group have been identified as belonging to the extreme-right based on their racial nationalism. It is noted, however, that this terminology wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be used by members of the group. 

==National branches==
The Odinic Rite expanded in the 1990s with national branches in Germany, France, and North America. The German chapter, Odinic Rite Deutschland (ORD), was formed in 1994. In its early history the ORD was heavily influenced by Bernd Hicker who was its chairman for seven years. It collaborated with the group Yggdrasil-Kreis in the 1990s; this group professed a &quot;European religion of nature&quot; and sought to combine Germanic and Celtic paganism.

Due to concerns about connections between the British OR and far-right politics, expressed already in 1995 in the ORD&#x27;s member&#x27;s magazine, as well as differing views of practice and organising, the ORD was established as an independent organisation in 2004. It changed its name to Verein für germanisches Heidentum (VfgH; ) in 2006.

==In popular culture==
In 1997 the Director of Gothar, Heimgest, chanted rune names on the Sol Invictus album &quot;The Blade&quot;.

<doc id="1242422" wikidata="Q7893210" url="?curid=1242422" title="United States v. Alvarez-Machain">
<text>United States v. Alvarez-Machain, 504 U.S. 655 (1992), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the respondent&#x27;s forcible abduction from a foreign country, despite the existence of an extradition treaty with said country, does not prohibit him from being tried before a U.S. court for violations of American criminal laws. The ruling reconfirmed the Ker-Frisbie Doctrine, established in &quot;Ker v. Illinois&quot; (1886) and &quot;Frisbie v. Collins&quot; (1952), which generally permits the prosecution of criminal defendants regardless of whether their presence was obtained in accordance with an applicable extradition treaty.

==Background==
Humberto Álvarez Machaín, a Mexican physician, was allegedly involved in the 1985 kidnapping, torture, and murder of Enrique Camarena Salazar, an American citizen employed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, by &quot;prolonging [his] life so that others could further torture and interrogate him.&quot;

On April 2, 1990, Álvarez was abducted from Mexico by Trent Tompkins, a U.S. citizen hired by DEA agents, and brought to trial in the United States over the protest of Mexican officials.

Legal action reached the Supreme Court, focusing upon the effect of illegal extradition upon the trial court&#x27;s jurisdiction. Invoking the &quot;Ker–Frisbie doctrine&quot; the Court held that the trial court&#x27;s jurisdiction was not affected by the manner in which the accused was brought before it. This created international alarm and concern as other nations feared that the decision would encourage further such abductions.

== Aftermath ==
Despite vigorous protests from the Mexican government, Álvarez was tried in United States District Court in Los Angeles; the trial, in which his defense focused intensely on the legality of the arrest, resulted in an acquittal. The trial judge (whose earlier decision dismissing the indictment had been overruled by the Supreme Court) ruled at the close of the government&#x27;s case in chief that the government had not presented a prima facie case, and therefore granted an acquittal without presenting the matter to the jury for verdict. The other suspect, Javier Vasquez Velasco, was arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder, convicted, and sentenced to three life sentences.

<text>HMSML &quot;Gleaner&quot; (H86) was the smallest commissioned vessel in the Royal Navy, at the time of her decommissioning, with a length of just under 15 metres and a ship&#x27;s company of just nine (two officers, one Senior Rating and six Junior Ratings). She was based in Devonport, Plymouth. The ship prefix &quot;HMSML&quot; stands for Her Majesty&#x27;s Survey Motor Launch.

&quot;Gleaner&quot; was withdrawn from service in February 2018. A replacement vessel, was commissioned in June 2018.

==History==
&quot;Gleaner&quot; was the sixth ship to bear the name and was commissioned on 5 December 1983. With a top speed of , &quot;Gleaner&quot; was designed to conduct inshore surveys along the south coast of England, though she has since surveyed all around the coastline of Great Britain and visited various ports in Europe.

As an advanced survey vessel, &quot;Gleaner&quot; possessed an array of sophisticated technology, including multibeam and sidescan sonar to collect bathymetry and seabed texture data and compile an accurate and detailed picture of the seabed for later analysis. Her survey equipment also included an Applanix POS MV system for georeferencing and motion compensation, C-NAV GPS, Kongsberg EM2040 Multibeam Echo Sounder and Kongsberg EA400 Singlebeam Echo Sounder.

&quot;Gleaner&quot; also has the distinction of being one of a handful of Royal Navy ships to have visited landlocked Switzerland, having travelled up the Rhine to Basel in 1988. Earlier visits were by HMS &quot;Flintham&quot; and &quot;Dittisham&quot; in 1969, and HMS &quot;Sabre&quot; and &quot;Cutlass&quot; in 1979.

She was also in attendance at the 2010 Portsmouth Navy Days.

In 2016, &quot;Gleaner&quot; conducted an extensive survey of the Firth of Forth as part of the preparation work for the departure of in the spring of 2017. This work was necessary as the most recent survey was 60 years old.

&quot;Gleaner&quot; entered Plymouth for the last time on 31 January 2018 before being decommissioned. &quot;Gleaner&quot; was replaced by , which was commissioned in June 2018.

<text>Vitello is a lunar impact crater that lies along the southern edge of the small Mare Humorum, in the southwest part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after 13th century Polish theologian and physicist Vitello. It lies just to the east of the lava-flooded crater Lee. To the northeast along the edge of the lunar mare is the Rupes Kelvin, an irregular fault line.

==Description==
This crater has a low, roughly circular rim with a sharp edge. The interior floor is irregular, rugged and hilly, with a ring of deep fractures surrounding the central peak. A low ridge projects out from the northwest rim into the mare.

Vitello was once believed to be a caldera rather than an impact crater. In &quot;To A Rocky Moon&quot;, lunar geologist Don Wilhelms summarized: It &quot;is a Saari-Shorthill infrared hotspot, is fractured, and is blanketed and surrounded by a dark deposit. If there is a caldera on the moon, this ought to be it.&quot; However, Lunar Orbiter 5 acquired high-resolution images of the interior and geologists noted that the fractures were filled with boulders which caused the infrared anomaly, and so volcanic heat was not escaping from Vitello. Wilhelms concluded &quot;...if it is a caldera, its activity expired long ago.&quot;

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Vitello.

<text>Shepard Settlement was a farming hamlet in the northeastern part of the Town of Skaneateles in Onondaga County, New York, United States.

Named for the first settlers, this was the second community founded in the Town of Skaneateles, after the Village of Skaneateles at the northern end of Skaneateles Lake. Other early settler families with numerous members in the immediate area include the Chapmans, Bishops, Horsingtons and Hares. The settlement was along Stump Road between Hoyt and Foster Roads on the west and Shepard Road on the east, centered roughly where Chapman Road ends at Stump Road. The hamlet was 2.6 miles west-northwest of the Village of Marcellus and four miles northeast of Skaneateles.

The various amenities of a rural community, such as a church and general store, have long since disappeared, leaving only Shepard Settlement Cemetery on the northwestern corner of Stump and Foster Roads to establish the community&#x27;s identity.

The Shepard Settlement Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

<text>Civilization IV (also known as Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization IV) is a 2005 4X turn-based strategy video game developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K. It is the fourth installment of the &quot;Civilization&quot; series and was designed by Soren Johnson. It was released in North America, Europe, and Australia, between October 25 and November 4, 2005, and followed by &quot;Civilization V&quot;.

&quot;Civilization IV&quot; uses the 4X empire-building model for turn-based strategy gameplay, in which the player&#x27;s main objective is to construct a civilization from limited initial resources. Most standard full-length games start the player with a settler unit and/or a city unit in the year 4000 BC. As with other games in the series, there are by default five objectives the player can pursue in order to finish the game: conquering all other civilizations, controlling a supermajority of the game world&#x27;s land and population, building and sending the first sleeper ship to the Alpha Centauri star system, increasing the &quot;Culture ratings&quot; of at least three different cities to &quot;legendary&quot; levels, or winning a &quot;World Leader&quot; popularity contest by the United Nations. If the time limit for the game is reached and none of the previous goals has been fulfilled by any players including game AI players, the civilization with the highest total game score is declared winner. A large departure from earlier &quot;Civilization&quot; games is a new graphics engine created from scratch, based on the Gamebryo engine by Numerical Design Limited (NDL).

The game has received critical acclaim and was hailed as an exemplary product of one of the leading video game producers in the turn-based strategy genre, and has been listed as one of the best video games of all time. &quot;Civilization IV&quot; sold over 3 million copies by 2008 and won multiple awards, including several Game of the Year awards. Its title song, &quot;Baba Yetu&quot;, was the first piece of video game music to win a Grammy Award. Two major expansions were released, &quot;Civilization IV: Warlords&quot; and &quot;Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword&quot;, as well as the stand-alone expansion pack &quot;Civilization IV: Colonization&quot;, which were all combined in 2009 into one release edition titled &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization IV: The Complete Edition&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Civilization IV&quot; follows some of the 4X model of turn-based strategy games, a genre in which players control an empire and &quot;explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate&quot;, by having the player attempt to lead a modest group of people from a base with initially scarce resources into a successful empire or civilization. The condition for winning the game is accomplished through one of the five ways: militarily defeating all other civilizations in the game world, controlling over two-thirds of the game world&#x27;s land and population, building the first spaceship in the Space Age and sending it to Alpha Centauri, having the most dominant Culture ratings over other civilizations, or becoming &quot;World Leader&quot; through the United Nations votes. Additionally, there are multiple game scores for each civilization throughout the game based on the actions of each civilization and a number of different factors, allowing for a win condition based on the total of these points if the game timer runs out. The game can be played in multiple modes: as a single player facing against one or more computer-controlled opponents, in hot seat mode, or through online multiplayer games.

As with other turn-based strategy video games, the player can customize the look and feel of their game world as well as the difficulty of any game AI players before the game starts. Each map space has a terrain type, such as plains, tundra, or desert, that affects the available resources players can extract from their environments and the movements of certain units through that terrain. The player is then given a total of 18 different civilizations to choose from, each with their own pros and cons, plus a leader avatar, an initial set of civilization technology, and any units unique to that civilization. When the game starts, however, it chooses random locations to place across a predefined square grid map. Like other strategy games, &quot;Civilization IV&quot; has a fog of war feature, in which unexplored territory remains darkened and territories without any units stationed on its designated square is shaded with darker colors.

===Units and combat===

Most units that the player can generate and use are military units, with certain attributes such as combat strength and movement rate particular to each military type. Each unit can gain experience through combat, which later translates into promotions that the player can use to assign military units new bonuses. Initially, most combat takes place on land, but further advancements in the game&#x27;s technology tree can allow the player to build ships and planes with which to fight battles on sea and in the air. Any number of units can be stacked onto a single space and move as a group if so assigned, but the overall combat phase is resolved by one-on-one unit battles.

Combat is initiated when moving military units are moved onto the square occupied by an opposing force&#x27;s military units and cities, and combat is then resolved with calculating statistics of each unit combined with some random chance. Defeated units are removed from the game (apart from workers and settlers, which are captured by the attacking force), and any attacking units that are able to defeat the last defending military unit on a space will move to occupy that space. If the space is occupied by a city the player may choose to occupy and capture the city as their own or raze it. Other than combat, military units can also be assigned to fortify a specific space, perform sentry duties, destroy enemy city improvements, or explore the game world.

Non-military units include settlers who are used to found cities, workers who are used to improve space and gather resources, spies who can perform counterintelligence and espionage, and religious missionaries who can be sent to convert different civilizations and cities. Also, with the Beyond the Sword expansion, new units are added such as executives, who can spread corporations to new cities. Throughout the game, players may also generate a special unit called a &quot;Great Person&quot;. These are named after historical figures and can be used for one-time advantage boosts in various ways; examples include Great Engineers who increase overall production levels and Great Scientists who improve technology. Assigning inhabitants of cities to work as &#x27;specialists&#x27; (scientists, engineers, artists, spies, merchants or priests), building certain wonders or discovering certain technologies can improve the rate at which Great People are generated. Great Generals are generated when a player&#x27;s forces achieve a certain number of victories, and can be used either to give a small amount of extra experience to all units trained in a city, or a very high level of experience to one unit. However, like other units, Great People of all kinds can be attacked and killed before the players can use them.

===Resources and buildings===
Once a city is founded, it will automatically begin extracting resources from surrounding spaces; the amount of spaces it can extract from is determined by the city&#x27;s population size. The game automatically allocates the spaces a city uses and how its resources are maintained as the city grows, but the player is free to manage the city directly. This feature can be utilized to turn a part of the population into one of several specialized occupations; at the cost of having one less space from the city, these specialists increase gathering and production of the resources of their targeted specializations.

Each city can only produce one military unit or one building at a time; any additional units or buildings are placed into a queue. The rate of construction is determined by the amount of material collected from the surrounding spaces; players can also choose to speed production by sacrificing gold or population if they adopt the required governmental policy; called civics. The player can instead specialize the city towards gathering a particular resource instead of constructing additional units or buildings. Also, in order to produce some units or buildings, certain resources must be collected within the empire and connected to the empires trade network by roads or harbours (for example, horses are needed for mounted units, and iron for swords, while stone or marble increase production of certain Wonders.).

Buildings perform any number of different functions depending on building type; for example, early buildings such as granaries improve food storage to boost the city&#x27;s growth and barracks produce better military units, while later buildings such as factories increase general production levels. There are also a number of unique buildings throughout the game. Most notable are World Wonders, which can be accessed through research nodes in the technology tree and construction through the worker unit. World Wonders provide advantages that are unique to each civilization, as they are limited to only one or two players.

Through buildings and specialists, each city also generates the &quot;Culture&quot; resource that contributes towards both the area upon which the city can influence for extracting resources and the overall civilization&#x27;s cultural value. When two cities of different civilizations are adjacent to each other, the culture values of each city influences the space they can control; it is even possible that a city close to another civilization&#x27;s city will join that civilization if their culture is strong enough. The high levels of culture gathering and attainment are also one of the default conditions that can be used to win the game.

===Technology, government and religion===

Once the first city has been founded, the player can select their first technology node from the game&#x27;s technology tree to research, once the required number of research points have been accumulated, the technology is obtained. As with other types of technology trees, more advanced technology nodes require the research of other previous technology nodes. The player can also select a future technology and immediately place into the game queue any technology nodes between the current technology level and the specified technology node. Technology can also determine another win condition; several endgame technology nodes are required to develop a colony ship to reach Alpha Centauri.

Within the technology tree are technology nodes relating to government civics and state religions, each with their own pros and cons. The player has the option of selecting which set of government civics or state religions that the player wants their civilization to follow, but not all civics and religions can be encompassed.

Once the player has formally met another civilization, they can perform diplomacy at any time. For example, if the two civilizations are on friendly terms, the player can ask to trade units and/or technology for gold and vice versa, or request opening of national borders in order to freely explore in the other civilization&#x27;s territories. The player can also use the diplomacy menu to request help in a war against a third civilization, or formally declare war on any civilization in which they engage diplomacy.

Religion plays a much more important role in &quot;Civilization IV&quot; than in the previous installments of the franchise. Impacting many of the game&#x27;s key mechanics like government civics and diplomatic relations, the game&#x27;s new religious system, according to Firaxis Games producer Barry Caudill, was added to increase gameplay depth over the entire game. The game features seven religions (Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism) that are founded by the first civilization to research a certain technology which varies per religion. Religions can then be spread actively through the production of missionary units or passively through means such as trade routes. Religions may be spread to domestic and foreign cities and there is no limit to the number of religions that can be present in any single city. The player may only choose one state religion at a time and all seven offer identical advantages (e.g. cities with the state religion receive bonuses in happiness, and potentially in production, science, gold and even military unit experience points).

===Customization===
&quot;Civilization IV&quot; is much more open to modification than its predecessors were. Game data and rules are stored in XML files, and a Software Development Kit was released in April 2006 to allow customization of game AI. The map editor supports Python.

The World Builder allows a player to either design a map from scratch or edit a preloaded template map as a starting point for a new game. The player can modify the map by placing and modifying any number of rivers, landmasses, mountains, resources, units, and cities, as well as their attributes such as Culture generation. The World Builder for &quot;Civilization IV&quot; is in-game, in contrast to previous &quot;Civilization&quot; games where the Map Editor was an external application.

More game attributes are stored in XML files, which can be edited with an external text editor or application. On September 20, 2005, Firaxis Games senior producer Barry Caudill stated that &quot;[e]diting these files will allow players to tweak simple game rules and change or add content. For instance, they can add new unit or building types, change the cost of wonders, or add new civilizations. Players can also change the sounds played at certain times or edit the play list for your soundtrack.&quot;

The &quot;Civilization IV&quot; software development kit was released on April 13, 2006, to coincide with the release of the v1.61 patch. The kit allows players to view, modify, or even completely re-write the game&#x27;s DLL source code, enabling the modification of the game&#x27;s AI and other integral parts of the game that were previously not accessible.

==Production==
===Production and development===
The game engine for &quot;Civilization IV&quot; was built entirely from scratch, with some help from NDL&#x27;s Gamebryo engine. This decision resulted in a full 3D immersion of the game, which was the first in the series, and which allowed easier readability and smoother, more in-depth zooming capabilities. Some of the quotes relating to the technology tree and narration for the game were provided by Leonard Nimoy. The soundtrack for the game features compositions of Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque origin, and design for the title music was influenced by &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Composer Christopher Tin wrote the opening theme song &quot;Baba Yetu&quot; (&quot;Swahili&quot; &quot;Our Father&quot;), a rendition of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, which was performed by Stanford University&#x27;s Talisman A Cappella. The song, when rereleased, became the first piece of video game music to be nominated for and to win a Grammy Award.

===Mods===

Sid Meier&#x27;s &quot;Civilization IV&quot; also released some bonus content, mainly to show modding capabilities:
* Earth – This is the world map of the game, based on the Robinson projection of the Earth in order to optimize its size. 124x68 tiles large, it features just 9 ancient civilizations. An 18 civilizations version of this mod was later released which won the first prize at a GameFlood modding contest.
* Earth Ice Age – This map is set in the world during the last ice age (20,000 years before present), with 11 randomly picked civilizations.
* Greek World – To reenact the classical Mediterranean, a special map was made, based on Hecataeus&#x27; map of the world as it was known by the Greeks. Extra detail was also borrowed from other ancient sources such as Homer, Ptolemy, and Herodotus.
* Rhye&#x27;s and Fall of Civilization – This mod changes much of the core settings of the game as an attempt at maintaining a sense of historical realism into the game. In order to do this, it introduces other features such as plagues and congresses.
* &quot;Fall from Heaven&quot; - a total conversion mod that reimagines the game in a dark fantasy setting, built by Derek Paxton. Its sequel &quot;Fall from Heaven II&quot; became the most downloaded mod on CivFanatics.

===Civilization Anonymous===
The game had a viral marketing campaign, revolving around a fictitious self-help organization known as Civilization Anonymous (shortened to CivAnon), the intention being to satirise how addictive the game was. With the slogan &quot;No More Turns&quot;, the premise was the following: &quot;Rumors have begun to circulate that the newest edition of the &quot;One More Turn&quot; franchise is on its way. STAY AWAY from this game at all costs. You will likely be powerless to its extreme addictive properties once exposed&quot;. Various characters were created, and their scenarios were included in various trailers showing the &quot;inside [of] a Civanon meeting for [Civilization] addicts,&quot; the first of which being played during E3 2005 once an hour at the 2K Games booth. These &quot;video testimonials of supposedly recovering Civilization addicts&quot; also featured cameos by Sid Meier. In addition to this, an &quot;official&quot; website was created by 2K Games with extra content. The Civilization Anonymous campaign was brought back for the following game Civilization V. Break described the campaign as &quot;hilarious&quot;, while Kotaku described it as a &quot;great promotional campaign&quot; that &quot;comes across as terrifyingly realistic&quot;. Destructoid shared this view, saying the support group campaign is &quot;a clever marketing tool&quot;, but wishing it existed as &quot;we all know there really are people who suffer from one-more-turn-itis&quot;. VantureBeat said the campaign was &quot;incredibly clever and funny&quot;, adding &quot;what made it so powerful was not the near-flawless execution and fine detail; it was the fact that it could have been real&quot;. &#x27;Ctrl-Alt-Play: Essays on Control in Video Gaming&#x27; noted the spoof highlighted the series&#x27; &quot;hyper-addictive turn-based gameplay&quot;. As part of the Civilization V version of the campaign, 2K Games asked Civilization addicts to submit stories via video in order to win $2,500 and a &quot;framed, limited edition Civilization Anonymous poster signed by Firaxis Games&quot;. The 2010 version was &quot;updated for modern concerns, like the franchise&#x27;s broader audience and iPhone editions of the game acting as a gateway drug.&quot;

===Release===
&quot;Civilization IV&quot; was published for the Windows and Mac OS X platforms. Aspyr released the Mac OS X version on June 26, 2006, and a Mac digital version was released January 2010 on gameagent.com. Users who quickly purchased the game after initial release reported having problems playing the game on particular sets of video drivers, which were later resolved by a Firaxis patch, according to GameSpy. By the end of March 2008, the game sold over three million units. Firaxis Games has also published two expansion packs for &quot;Civilization IV&quot;, entitled &quot;Civilization IV: Warlords&quot; and &quot;Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword&quot;. A remake of the original 1994 &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Colonization&quot;, rebuilt with &quot;Civilization IV&quot;&#x27;s game engine and titled &quot;Civilization IV: Colonization&quot;, was released for Mac and PC as a standalone game and later bundled with the two expansions as &quot;Civilization IV: The Complete Edition&quot;.

== Reception ==
===Sales===
&quot;Civilization IV&quot; was a commercial success, and sold more than 1 million units by mid-March 2006. By that time, it had held a top-10 position on every weekly computer game sales chart released by The NPD Group since the game&#x27;s launch. NPD declared &quot;Civilization IV&quot; the 11th-best-selling computer game of 2005, and it rose to ninth place on the firm&#x27;s annual computer game sales chart for the following year. It returned to NPD&#x27;s year-end top 20 in 2008 with a 13th-place finish. The game also received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. According to Take-Two Interactive, sales of &quot;Civilization IV&quot; surpassed 3 million units by March 2008.

===Critical reviews===
&quot;Civilization IV&quot; received universal critical acclaim with an aggregate score of 94 on Metacritic and an aggregate score of 93.36% on GameRankings. Critics such as GameSpot&#x27;s Andrew Park praised not only the improvements in the turn-based strategy genre that carried over from other installments in the series, but also noted the game&#x27;s more advanced 3D computer graphics, difficult AI opponents, and multiplayer feature. &quot;The Times&quot; praised the improvements of the 3D engine used to generally build the game, and GameGuru appreciated its ability to zoom onto individual squares. IGN commented that the game AI was much more intelligent than it was in &quot;Civilization III&quot;, which designer Soren Johnson stated was thanks to their &quot;secret pre-beta group&quot; testing the game before release. Game Revolution remarked that &quot;the multiplayer... actually works this time&quot; and GameSpot added that both &quot;single-player and multiplayer options have been improved in &quot;Civ IV&quot;.&quot;

Though it had received mostly positive feedback, video game critics pointed out functions in the game which could have been improved to enhance their enjoyment of the game. Steve Butts from IGN suggested that in-game announcements about enemy achievements should be displayed more prominently, and that the multiplayer feature could have included &quot;an option to save my username and password.&quot; Likewise, GameSpy&#x27;s Dave Kosak pointed out other flaws of the multiplayer interface, stating that it &quot;is a little rough in places. The built-in server browser, for instance, will keep jumping around the list as you try to find a game.&quot; GameSpot also noted the lack of a &quot;religion-based victory condition&quot;, which downplayed the influence that the revamped religion system was supposed to have on the game.

In August 2016, &quot;Civilization IV&quot; placed 11th on &quot;Time&quot;″s The 50 Best Video Games of All Time list. In 2021, &quot;PCGamesN&quot; ranked it as the best game in the series.

=== Awards ===
&quot;Civilization IV&quot; won multiple awards at various events and gaming websites.
* IGN chose it as the PC Game of the Year of 2005 over competing titles such as &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; and &quot;Guild Wars&quot;, as the Best Strategy Game (both for PC and overall) and as the Best Online Game of 2005 for PC. In 2006, IGN ranked it first place on The Editor&#x27;s Top 10 list and second place on the Top 25 PC Games of All Time list.
* GameSpot awarded the game Best Strategy Game and Best PC Game, and it was nominated as an entry for Game of the Year.
* GameSpy named the game Game of the Year, PC Game of the Year, and Best PC Turn-Based Strategy Game of the Year.
* At the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Civilization IV&quot; won &quot;Strategy Game of the Year&quot;, and was nominated for &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot;.
* At the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards of 2010, the song &quot;Baba Yetu&quot;, which was written to be the title theme for &quot;Civilization IV&quot;, won in the Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist category, because it had been allowed eligibility in the competition through Christopher Tin&#x27;s inclusion of the song in his subsequent release of his 2009 album Calling All Dawns. This decision made &quot;Baba Yetu&quot; a landmark in video game history as the first Grammy Award nomination and win for any video game theme.

The editors of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; named &quot;Civilization IV&quot; the best computer game of 2005, and presented it with their awards for &quot;Best Strategy Game&quot;, &quot;Best AI&quot; and &quot;Best Interface&quot;. They wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s a towering achievement, even for a series as revered as this one. Even for long-time fans of the series, playing &quot;Civilization IV&quot; is like discovering it for the very first time.&quot; &quot;Civilization IV&quot; also won &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s &quot;Best Turn-Based Strategy Game 2005&quot; award. The magazine&#x27;s Dan Stapleton called it &quot;a huge facelift to a winning formula.&quot; It was nominated as &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s &quot;Best Multiplayer Game 2005&quot; and overall game of the year, but lost in these categories to &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, a pointed set (also based set or rooted set) is an ordered pair formula_1 where formula_2 is a set and formula_3 is an element of formula_2 called the base point (also spelled basepoint).

Maps between pointed sets formula_1 and formula_6—called based maps, pointed maps, or point-preserving maps—are functions from formula_2 to formula_8 that map one basepoint to another, i.e. maps formula_9 such that formula_10. Based maps are usually denoted formula_11.

Pointed sets are very simple algebraic structures. In the sense of universal algebra, a pointed set is a set formula_2 together with a single nullary operation formula_13 which picks out the basepoint. Pointed maps are the homomorphisms of these algebraic structures. 

The class of all pointed sets together with the class of all based maps forms a category. Every pointed set can be converted to an ordinary set by forgetting the basepoint (the forgetful functor is faithful), but the reverse is not true. In particular, the empty set cannot be pointed, because it has no element that can be chosen as the basepoint.

==Categorical properties==
The category of pointed sets and based maps is equivalent to the category of sets and partial functions. The base point serves as a &quot;default value&quot; for those arguments for which the partial function is not defined. One textbook notes that &quot;This formal completion of sets and partial maps by adding &#x27;improper&#x27;, &#x27;infinite&#x27; elements was reinvented many times, in particular, in topology (one-point compactification) and in theoretical computer science.&quot; This category is also isomorphic to the coslice category (formula_14), where formula_15 is (a functor that selects) a singleton set, and formula_16 (the identity functor of) the category of sets. This coincides with the algebraic characterization, since the unique map formula_17 extends the commutative triangles defining arrows of the coslice category to form the commutative squares defining homomorphisms of the algebras. 

There is a faithful functor from pointed sets to usual sets, but it is not full and these categories are not equivalent.

The category of pointed sets is a pointed category. The pointed singleton sets formula_18 are both initial objects and terminal objects, i.e. they are zero objects. The category of pointed sets and pointed maps has both products and coproducts, but it is not a distributive category. It is also an example of a category where formula_19 is not isomorphic to formula_20.

==Applications==
Many algebraic structures rely on a distinguished point. For example, groups are pointed sets by choosing the identity element as the basepoint, so that group homomorphisms are point-preserving maps. This observation can be restated in category theoretic terms as the existence of a forgetful functor from groups to pointed sets.

A pointed set may be seen as a pointed space under the discrete topology or as a vector space over the field with one element.

As &quot;rooted set&quot; the notion naturally appears in the study of antimatroids and transportation polytopes.

<text>The Fox is a novella by D. H. Lawrence which first appeared in &quot;The Dial&quot; in 1922. Set in Berkshire, England, during World War I, &quot;The Fox&quot;, like many of D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s other major works, deals with the psychological relationships of three protagonists in a triangle of love and hatred. Without the help of any male laborers, Nellie March and Jill Banford struggle to maintain a marginal livelihood at the Bailey Farm. A fox has raged through the poultry, and although the women—particularly the more masculine Nellie—have tried to shoot the intruder, he seems always to elude traps or gunshot.

== Plot introduction ==
Banford and March live on a farm together because it does not look like they will marry. Although they are only in their late twenties, in that era women who were still single at their age were generally considered to have forgone the prospect of marriage. Banford is thin and frail, in contrast to her companion who is physically masculine. However particular emphasis is given to March&#x27;s face, which is feminine and expressive. The women are depicted as fearful of femininity and fertility. For example, they sell a heifer before it calves.

The fox becomes a hindrance to Banford and March, but March finds she cannot hunt it, and rather, she becomes entranced by it. Shortly after this, Henry, a young man, comes to stay with the women, and a link is established between the fox and Henry.
This intriguing novella explores gender roles, sexuality, femininity, and the pity of war, as do two other Lawrence novellas written at the same time, &quot;The Ladybird&quot; and &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Doll&quot;.

==Film adaptation==
A 1967 film was made from &quot;The Fox&quot;, starring Sandy Dennis as Jill Banford, Anne Heywood as Ellen March, and Keir Dullea as Paul (not Henry) Grenfield.

<doc id="1242447" wikidata="Q1501358" url="?curid=1242447" title="Theophoric name">
<text>A theophoric name (from Greek: , &quot;theophoros&quot;, literally &quot;bearing or carrying a god&quot;) embeds the word equivalent of &#x27;god&#x27; or God&#x27;s name in a person&#x27;s name, reflecting something about the character of the person so named in relation to that deity. For example, names embedding Apollo, such as &quot;Apollonios&quot; or &quot;Apollodorus&quot;, existed in Greek antiquity.

Theophoric personal names, containing the name of a god in whose care the individual is entrusted (or a generic word for &quot;god&quot;), were also exceedingly common in the ancient Near East and Mesopotamia. Some names of theophoric origin remain common today, such as Theodore (&quot;theo-&quot;, &quot;god&quot;; &quot;-dore&quot;, origin of word compound in Greek: &quot;doron&quot;, &quot;gift&quot;; hence &quot;God&#x27;s gift&quot;; in Greek: &quot;Theodoros&quot;) or, less recognisably, Jonathan (from Hebrew &quot;Yonatan/Yehonatan&quot;, meaning &quot;Yahweh has given&quot;).

== Classical Greek and Roman theophoric names ==


Certain names of classical gods are sometimes given as personal names. The most common is Diana and its variants, such as Diane; others include Minerva, Aphrodite, Venus, Isis, or Juno. The first pope to take a regnal name, Pope John II, had the given name Mercurius and changed his name as he considered it inappropriate for the pope to have a pagan deity&#x27;s name.

Some Christian saints have polytheistic theophoric names (such as Saint Dionysius, Saint Mercurius, Saint Saturninus, Saint Hermes, Saint Martin of Tours, Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki).

==Germanic theophoric names==

* Os, meaning &quot;god&quot;
** Oscar
** Oslac
** Oswald
** Oswin
* Thor, the god of thunder
** Thorstein means &quot;Thor&#x27;s stone&quot;
** Thorkel means &quot;Thor&#x27;s craft&quot;
** Thorulf means &quot;Thor&#x27;s wolf&quot;
** Thordis
** Thora
* Ing, an old name for Freyr (an epithet meaning &quot;lord&quot;)
** Ingrid
** Ingeborg
** Inger
** Ingunn

Rarely, Germanic names contain the element &quot;Wod&quot; (such as &quot;Woðu-riðe&quot;), potentially pointing to an association with the god Odin. In connection, numerous names containing &quot;wulf&quot; &quot;wolf&quot; have been taken as totemistic, expressing association with Odin in the earliest period, although &quot;-ulf&quot; degenerated into a mere suffix from an early time (Förstemann 1856).

==Hinduism==

The personal names of almost all gods and goddesses of various deities from the polytheistic Hindu pantheon are considered common and traditional names for people from the Indian subcontinent. Many traditional Hindu names are in fact from various names or epithets of Hindu gods or goddesses. This is in addition to compound theophoric names using the name of a deity in addition to possessive qualifiers.

* Names of gods that are also used as personal names include
** Vishnu
** Shiva
** Lakshmi
** Parvati
** Indra
* Personal names using a deity&#x27;s name as the base
** Vaishnavi, meaning &quot;a worshipper of Vishnu&quot;
** Shivansh, meaning &quot;a part of Shiva&quot;

Brahma, the Hindu creator god, is one of the only deities of the pantheon whose name is rarely if ever used as a personal name or a base for theophoric personal names.

Some seemingly theophoric names may in fact be more related to the original etymology of the deity&#x27;s name itself. For example, both Lakshmi (fortune, success, prosperity) and Lakshman (prosperous, principal, marked) are names of a deity and an avatar respectively, which are related to &quot;lakṣ&quot; meaning &quot;to mark or see&quot;.

==Islam==

* Abdullah: &quot;servant of God&quot;

==Judaism==
Much Hebrew theophory occurs in the Jewish Bible. The most prominent theophoric names are:
* names containing El, a word meaning &quot;might&quot;, &quot;power&quot; and (a) &quot;god&quot; in general, and hence in Judaism, &quot;God&quot; and among the Canaanites the name of the god who was the father of Baal.
* names containing Yah, a shortened form of Yahweh.
* names referring to Levantine deities (especially the storm god, Hadad) by the epithet &quot;Baal&quot;, meaning &quot;lord&quot;.

In later times, as the conflict between Yahwism and the more popular pagan practices became increasingly intense, these names were censored and &quot;Baal&quot; was replaced with &quot;Bosheth&quot;, meaning &quot;shameful one&quot;. But the name Yahweh does not appear in theophoric names until the time of Joshua, and for the most part is very rare until the time of King Saul, when it began to be very popular.

===El===

* Abdiel: &quot;Servant of God&quot;
* Ariel: &quot;lion of God&quot;
* Danel: &quot;El is judge&quot; or &quot;justice from El&quot;
* Daniel: &quot;God is my judge&quot; or &quot;justice from God&quot;
* Elijah: &quot;my God is YHWH&quot;
* Elihu: &quot;He is my God&quot;
* Elisha: &quot;my God is salvation&quot;
* Elisheba (Elizabeth): &quot;my God is an oath&quot; or &quot;my God is abundance&quot;
* Immanuel: &quot;God is with us&quot;
* Yehezkel (Ezekiel): &quot;God will strengthen&quot;
* Gabriel: &quot;man of God&quot; or &quot;power of God&quot;
* Ishmael: &quot;God listens&quot;
* Israel: &quot;who struggles with God&quot;
* Lemuel: &quot;Dedicated/Devoted to God&quot;
* Michael: &quot;Who is like God?&quot;
* Nathaniel: &quot;God-given&quot; or &quot;gift of God&quot;
* Raphael: &quot;God heals/God is great&quot;
* Samuel: &quot;God heard&quot;
* Uriel: &quot;God is my light&quot;
* Uzziel: &quot;God is my strength&quot;

===Yahweh===

The name of the Israelite deity YHWH (usually shortened to Yah or Yahu, and Yeho or Yo) appears as a prefix or suffix in many theophoric names of the First Temple Period. For example, &quot;Yirme-yahu&quot; (Jeremiah), &quot;Yesha-yahu&quot; (Isaiah), &quot;Netan-yah&quot;, &quot;Yedid-yah&quot;, &quot;Adoni-yah&quot;, &quot;Nekhem-yah&quot;, &quot;Yeho-natan&quot; (Jonathan), &quot;Yeho-chanan&quot; (John), &quot;Yeho-shua&quot; (Joshua), &quot;Yeho-tzedek&quot;, &quot;Zekharya&quot; (Zechariah).

&quot;Yahū&quot; or &quot;Yah&quot; is the abbreviation of YHWH when used as a suffix in Hebrew names; as a prefix it appears as &quot;Yehō-&quot;, or &quot;Yo&quot;. It was formerly thought to be abbreviated from the Masoretic pronunciation &quot;Yehovah&quot;. There is an opinion that, as Yahweh is likely an imperfective verb form, &quot;Yahu&quot; is its corresponding preterite or jussive short form: compare &quot;yiŝtahaweh&quot; (imperfective), &quot;yiŝtáhû&quot; (preterit or jussive short form) = &quot;do obeisance&quot;.

* Abijah: &quot;my father is YHWH&quot;
* Adonijah: &quot;YHWH is the Lord&quot;
* Hezekiah: &quot;YHWH strengthens&quot;
* Isaiah: &quot;YHWH is salvation&quot;
* Jedediah: &quot;friend of YHWH&quot;
* Jehu: &quot;YHWH is He&quot;
* Jeremiah (Jeremy): &quot;YHWH will raise&quot;
* Joel: &quot;YHWH is God&quot;
* Jonathan: &quot;YHWH has given&quot;
* Joseph: &quot;YHWH shall increase&quot;
* Josiah: &quot;YHWH saves&quot;
* Matityahu (Matthew): &quot;gift of YHWH&quot;
* Micah/Micaiah: &quot;who is like YHWH?&quot;
* Nehemiah: &quot;YHWH comforts&quot;
* Obadiah: &quot;servant of YHWH&quot;
* Toviyahu (Tobias): &quot;the goodness of YHWH&quot;
* Uriah: &quot;YHWH is my light&quot;
* Uzziah: &quot;YHWH is my strength&quot;
* Yeho&#x27;ezer (Yoʼezer): &quot;YHWH is my help&quot;
* Yehoshua (Joshua)/Yeshua (Jesus): &quot;YHWH will save&quot;
* Yohanan (John): &quot;graced by YHWH&quot; or &quot;YHWH is gracious&quot;
* Zechariah (Zachary): &quot;YHWH has remembered&quot;
* Zephaniah: &quot;hidden by YHWH&quot;

In the table below, 13 theophoric names with &quot;Yeho&quot; have corresponding forms where the letters &quot;eh&quot; have been omitted. There is a theory by Christian Ginsburg that this is because Hebrew scribes omitted the &quot;h&quot;, changing Jeho () into Jo (), to make the start of &quot;Yeho-&quot; names not sound like an attempt to pronounce the Divine Name.

===Referring to other gods===
* Jerubbaal, the alternate name of Gideon, variously translated as &quot;Baal will contend&quot; 
* Jezebel: &quot;glory to Baal&quot;
* Ishbaal: &quot;man of Baal&quot;
* Balthazar and Belshazzar (Babylonian): &quot;Baal, protect the king&quot; 
* Abijam: &quot;my father is Yam&quot;
* Shalmaneser (Assyrian): &quot;Shulmanu is foremost&quot;
* Sennacherib (Assyrian): &quot;Sîn has replaced the brothers&quot;
* Pygmalion (Phoenician via Greek): &quot;Pummay has given&quot;
* Nebuchadnezzar (in Babylonian: &quot;Nabu-kudurri-usur&quot;): &quot;Nabu, watch over my heir&quot;
* Mordecai: &quot;from Marduk&quot;
* Ben-Hadad: in Hebrew means &quot;son of Hadad&quot;, but his original Aramaic name is Hadadezer: &quot;Hadad is help&quot;

Theophoric names containing &quot;Baal&quot; were sometimes &quot;censored&quot; as &quot;-bosheth&quot; = &quot;shameful one&quot;, whence Ishbosheth etc.

<text>The common collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), also commonly called eastern collared lizard, Oklahoma collared lizard, yellow-headed collared lizard, and collared lizard, is a North American species of lizard in the family Crotaphytidae. The common name &quot;collared lizard&quot; comes from the lizard&#x27;s distinct coloration, which includes bands of black around the neck and shoulders that look like a collar. Males can be very colorful, with blue green bodies, yellow stripes on the tail and back, and yellow orange throats. There are five recognized subspecies. 

== Etymology ==
The subspecific name, &quot;baileyi&quot;, is in honor of American mammalogist Vernon Orlando Bailey.

==Subspecies==
Five subspecies are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies.
*&quot;Crotaphytus collaris auriceps&quot; – yellow-headed collared lizard
*&quot;Crotaphytus collaris baileyi&quot; – western collared lizard
*&quot;Crotaphytus collaris collaris&quot; – eastern collared lizard
*&quot;Crotaphytus collaris fuscus&quot; – Chihuahuan collared lizard
*&quot;Crotaphytus collaris melanomaculatus&quot; – black-spotted collared lizard

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Crotaphytus&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;C. collaris&quot; can grow up to in total length (including the tail), with a large head and powerful jaws. Males have a blue-green body with a light brown head. Females have a light brown head and body.
&quot;C. collaris&quot; exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics, particularly in coloration and spotting patterns, and this phenotypic variability may be attributed to a combination of differences in population, social organizations, or habitat. They are a sexually dichromatic lizard species with the adult males being more vivid and colorful than the females. Male dorsal and head color tend to range from green to tan and yellow to orange respectively, while females, overall, possess more muted body pigmentations, varying from brown to gray. However, when reproductively active during breeding seasons, females undergo a rapid color change, in which faint orange spots on their heads increase in brightness; this orange spotting reaches a maximum during egg maturation but gradually fades again after expulsion from the female&#x27;s oviduct as she lays her eggs. Both males and females have two distinct black bands around their neck, providing additional context to their name, the common collared lizards.

Similar to adult females, juveniles also exhibit dull body colorations compared to adult males, but a key distinction is that the young have pronounced, dark brown markings that eventually fade as they grow and mature. Consequently, juvenile collared lizards lose this sharp cross-band pattern, and their features drastically change to resemble those of either adult males or females.

Moderate in size, &quot;C. collaris&quot; have disproportionately large heads and long hind limbs. It can reach a length of 14 inches, including the tail, with males being larger than females. Hence, they are sexually dimorphic, and adult males exhibit larger and more muscular heads than females, which tend to vary in size. Used as a weapon during male combat, the head dimensions play a key role in determining dominance, territoriality, fitness, as well as mating success. In general, bigger heads are associated with greater jaw strength and thus, bite force.

== Bipedal locomotion ==
&quot;C. collaris&quot; are able to run on their hind legs and can sprint at speeds of up to 24 kilometers per hour. This behavior is usually observed when trying to escape predators.

Like many other lizards, including the frilled lizard and basilisk, the collared lizard can run on its hind legs, and is a relatively fast sprinter. Record speeds have been around , much slower than the world record for lizards () attained by the larger-bodied Costa Rican spiny-tailed iguana, &quot;Ctenosaura similis&quot;.

==Geographic range and habitat==
&quot;C. collaris&quot; is chiefly found in dry, open regions of Mexico and the south-central United States including Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. The full extent of its habitat in the United States ranges from the Ozark Mountains to Western Arizona. 

&quot;C. collaris&quot; is distributed across the Southwestern United States and extend to Northern Mexico as well. Individuals occupy a range of different habitats from rocky desert landscapes to grasslands, but they often prefer to inhabit mountainous regions with high environmental temperatures for optimal thermoregulation. In addition, the hilly topography allows these keen and highly alert lizards to stay hidden between rocks, despite their flamboyant features, and look out for potential predators or territory intruders from the top of elevated platforms.

== Diet ==
As obligate carnivores, they consume insects and small vertebrates as their main diet. While they may occasionally ingest plant materials, it is not preferred. They feed on a variety of large insects, including crickets, grasshoppers, spiders, moths, beetles, and cicadas, along with other small lizards and even snakes. As plants do not provide enough nutrients for constant body weight maintenance, &quot;C. collaris&quot; cannot survive solely on an herbivorous diet. Their stomachs are too small to accommodate the amount of flowers, shrubs, herbs, etc. that would be needed to maintain a constant body weight. Thus, they are considered obligate carnivores, requiring nutrients from arthropods or other small reptiles. 

Diet can also vary depending on age, sex, as well as seasonal changes. In the case of younger lizards, they consume the same kinds of foods, specifically insect species, that adults do, but since younger lizards and adults differ in body size and weight, the amount of food intake tends to vary. On the other hand, male and female adults are similar in terms of their sizes and the amounts of food ingested but exhibit drastic differences in the kinds of foods that they eat. From an evolutionary standpoint, these sexual differences in diet may act to reduce intra-species competition for resources, whereby females and males do not need to fight for the same type of food. Moreover, changes in season can drastically affect their diets as well.

==Cultural impact==
The collared lizard is the state reptile of Oklahoma, where it is known as the mountain boomer. The origin of the name &quot;mountain boomer&quot; is not clear, but it may be traceable to settlers traveling west during the Gold Rush. One theory is that settlers mistook the sound of wind in canyons for the call of an animal in an area where the collared lizard was abundant. In reality, collared lizards are silent. 

==Behavior==

Collared lizards are diurnal; they are active during the day, and spend most of their time basking on top of elevated rocks or boulders. As a highly territorial species, they remain hyper-vigilant, scanning for predators or intruders, ready to sprint or fight when necessary. Generally, males are more active than females, as the former engage in more chase, fight, display, and courtship behaviors while the latter exhibit basking and foraging behaviors. The collared lizard in the wild has been the subject of a number of studies of sexual selection; in captivity if two males are placed in the same cage they will fight to the death. Females, on the other hand, do not demonstrate aggressive behaviors as frequently as males, experiencing less intra-species competition with other females. 

=== Social behavior ===
In an effort to monopolize as many female mates as they can, male &quot;C. collaris&quot; viciously defend their exclusive territories through aggression, patrolling activities, and displays. These territories provide ample resources and shelter the harem of females claimed and protected by the male territory owners. However, when agonistic interactions between male rivals escalate to violent fights, both lizards must expend substantial amounts of energy and risk getting seriously injured. Thus, though males do actively exclude other males from territories, they do so without resorting to physical and unfavorable conflict. Instead, they partake in social displays, either at a distance or proximally from their competitors to advertise their superiority. Surprisingly, both types of social encounters, in which males perform push ups and compressions and elevations of the trunk with the dewlap extended, rarely lead to arduous and violent fights; rather, distant displays barely evoke a response while proximal confrontations may lead to chasing at most. 

Furthermore, &quot;C. collaris&quot; territory owners exhibit differential behaviors in response to neighbors and strangers, in which residents reduce the cost of territorial defense by demonstrating less aggression for spatial neighbors. Thus, when nearby residents approach an owner&#x27;s shared territorial boundaries, the owner will recognize this individual and only engage in aggressive behaviors, usually in the form of a costly fight, if a threat to its territory is perceived. However, in the case of a stranger, the owner will exhibit intense hostility towards the intruder without hesitation. In relation, male territorial behaviors also vary within the reproductive season, decreasing in June due to the higher prevalence of reproductively active females and instead, engaging in more courtship behaviors. This cost-benefit strategy demonstrates the complex social behaviors and decision making processes exhibited by the male collared lizards.

== Reproduction ==
The reproductive season starts in mid-March to early April and concludes in mid-July. Females and smaller individuals emerge first from hibernation with males following around two weeks later. Though lizards are considered mature and may breed following their first hibernation, those that are two years and older exhibit greater reproductive success due to their larger size. In late May, courtship occurs between adult males and females. Subsequently, mature females, typically two years and older, produce their first clutches and lay them in a burrow or under a rock about two weeks after copulation. They may then go on to produce second and sometimes even third clutches throughout June until mid-July. The eggs are incubated in a temperature dependent manner, and the incubation period may vary from 50 to 100 days. On average, clutch size can range from 4 to 6 eggs, but larger, older females can produce more. By August, adults begin to hibernate again, and juveniles do the same after hatching. The earliest of the clutches can hatch in mid-July and later ones follow until mid-October. Upon hatching, juveniles are fully developed and behave independently of their parents, as the &quot;C. collaris&quot; do not exhibit any parental care in offspring. 

=== Mating behavior and rituals===
&quot;C. collaris&quot; are polygamous, which leads to intense territorial behaviors that include male to male competition for females partners. This triggers aggressive behaviors in males and induces fierce competition for mating. With regards to female selection of male mates, females not only prefer males who are bright and conspicuous in body coloration but also consider the resources such as food and territory that males may be able to provide in order to ensure reproductive success. Moreover, as males often must compete with other males for potential mates, their body and head size play a significant role in determining mating success. The variability in head size gives rise to differential jaw strength and bite force in males, which ultimately results in intra-species selection against smaller headed males. For example, if an instance of male-to-male conflict escalates into a violent fight between two males, the larger male with a substantial larger body mass and head size will overpower its weaker and smaller counterpart. Consequently, successful males may, more often than not, possess vibrant body coloration and patterns and may be bigger in size, specifically having larger head proportions.

During courtship rituals, a male or a female lizard approaches the opposite sex within 1 body length and subsequently engages in various behavioral patterns, which include either individual superimposing its limbs, torso, or tail over its partner, mounting the dorsum of the other lizard, males nudging females with their snouts or grasping them with their jaws, and mutual displays. These mutual displays involve a complex set of movements and behaviors, unique to each sex. Males flex their forearms up and down and extend their dewlaps while females also extend their dewlaps and raise the base of their tails to signal receptivity. Ultimately, at the end of this courting process, both sexes walk in circles, making sure to remain within 1 body length of one another throughout.

<text>Perleberg (; North Margravian: &quot;Perlberg&quot;) is the capital of the district of Prignitz, located in the northwest of the German state of Brandenburg. The town received city rights in 1239 and today has about 12,000 inhabitants. Located in a mostly agricultural area, the town has a long history of troops (most notably Prussian) being stationed there and as an administrative center for local government.

==Geography==
Perleberg is located in the heart of the district of Prignitz, about halfway between the two largest German cities Berlin and Hamburg. It is surrounded by the municipalities Karstädt to the north-west, Gross Pankow (Prignitz) to the north-east, Plattenburg to the south-east; the &quot;Ämter&quot; Bad Wilsnack/Weisen in the south, Lenzen-Elbtalaue in the west; and the town of Wittenberge to the south-west.

The Stepenitz flows from northeast to southwest through Perleberg. The town&#x27;s historic center is built on an island between two arms of the river.

==History==
One of the town&#x27;s oldest buildings is St James&#x27;s Church. First mentioned in 1294, it was frequently altered and extensively remodelled in the 1850s. In German, it is called the &quot;Jakobikirche&quot;, and therefore sometimes mistakenly called &quot;St Jacob&#x27;s&quot; in English.

In the 14th century the town was at its height as part of the Hanseatic League. In 1523 it was the muster point for an army assembled by Elector Joachim I in support of his brother-in-law Christian II of Denmark&#x27;s attempt to recover his throne. The Thirty Years&#x27; War caused serious damage to the town: of 3,500 inhabitants, only 300 survived. The mayor responsible for rebuilding the town after this period was Georg Krusemarck.

On November 25, 1809, Benjamin Bathurst disappeared in Perleberg. Later accounts of the incident exaggerated the circumstances to such an extent that the disappearance is sometimes claimed to have been caused by paranormal phenomena.

== Demography ==


== Twin towns - sister cities ==
Perleberg is twinned with:
* Kaarst, Germany
* Szczawnica, Poland

== People ==

* Lotte Lehmann, born here
* Dörte von Westernhagen, born here
* Ernst Ehrenbaum (1861–1942), biologist
* James Broh (1867–1942), lawyer, publicist and politician

<doc id="1242469" wikidata="Q15515422" url="?curid=1242469" title="Frank Crisp">
<text>Sir Frank Crisp, 1st Baronet, (25 October 1843 – 29 April 1919) was an English lawyer, microscopist and officer of the Royal Microscopical Society, to which he donated furniture, books, instruments and work on technical publications.

==Life and death==

Frank Crisp was born on 25 October 1843 in London. His mother died when he was three years old and as a result he was brought up by his grandfather, John Filby Childs. He resolved to take up the law and at 16 was articled to a firm of solicitors. He also studied at the University of London, obtaining the degrees of BA in 1864 and LLB in 1865. In 1867 he married Catherine Howes. From 1881 to 1906, he was a treasurer, and later a vice-president, of the Linnean Society; Catherine Crisp, along with 14 of 15 other women whose names were presented on 17 November 1904, was elected a fellow of the Society, withdrawing in 1916.

Crisp qualified as a solicitor in 1869 and his reputation soon grew, acting in many important commercial contracts. He counted several foreign railroad companies and the Imperial Japanese Navy among his clients, and drew up the contract for the cutting of the Cullinan diamond.

Having been knighted on 16 December 1907, Crisp was created a baronet on 5 February 1913 for services as legal advisor to the Liberal Party.

In 1889, Crisp bought Friar Park in Henley-on-Thames. He was a keen horticulturist and developed spectacular public gardens there, including an alpine garden featuring a 20-foot (6-metre) replica of the Matterhorn. He published an exhaustive survey of medieval gardening titled &quot;Mediaeval Gardens&quot;. He commissioned Henry Ernest Milner to design the gardens.

Crisp died on 29 April 1919 aged 75.

==Legacy==
Former Beatle George Harrison purchased Friar Park in January 1970. He wrote a tribute to Crisp called &quot;Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)&quot;, which appeared on the album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and later provided part of the title for his 2009 career-spanning compilation &quot;Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison&quot;. In addition, Harrison&#x27;s 1974 hit single &quot;Ding Dong, Ding Dong&quot; contains the lyrical refrain &quot;Ring out the old, ring in the new / Ring out the false, ring in the true&quot;, which was taken from one of a number of inscriptions Crisp had engraved in the house and grounds of the property. (It is actually from Ring Out, Wild Bells, a section of the Tennyson poem &quot;In Memoriam A. H. H.&quot;) The lyrics and title of another Harrison track, &quot;The Answer&#x27;s at the End&quot;, were also inspired by the writings of Frank Crisp: &quot;Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass / You know his faults, now let his foibles pass / Life is one long enigma, my friend / So read on, read on, the answer&#x27;s at the end.&quot;

<text>Mu Draconis (μ Draconis, abbreviated Mu Dra, μ Dra) is a multiple star system near the head of the constellation of Draco. With a combined magnitude of 4.92, it is visible to the naked eye. Based on parallax estimates by the Hipparcos spacecraft, it is located approximately 89 light-years from the Sun.

The system consists of a single primary star (designated Mu Draconis A, officially named Alrakis from the traditional name of the system), a secondary binary pair (Mu Draconis B) and a further single star (C). B&#x27;s two components are designated Mu Draconis Ba and Bb.

Mu Draconis A and Ba are nearly identical F-type main-sequence stars, with masses of and , respectively. Both have the spectral class of F5V, and have similar apparent magnitude, at 5.66 and 5.69, respectively. The secondary, Mu Draconis B, has a drifting radial velocity, and is itself a spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 2,270 days. The distance between both stars is 2 arcseconds, so a telescope with a diameter of at least 6 centimetres is necessary to see them separate. The smaller component, Mu Draconis Bb, has a mass of . Mu Draconis C is a 14th magnitude common-proper-motion companion 13.2&quot; away from the bright pair, with a mass of .

== Nomenclature ==

μ Draconis (Latinised to &quot;Mu Draconis&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation. The designations of the three constituents as &quot;Mu Draconis A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;, and those of &quot;B&#x27;s&quot; components - &quot;Mu Draconis Ba&quot; and &quot;Bb&quot; - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

It is also known by the name &quot;Arrakis&quot; (or &quot;Errakis&quot;), which is derived from the name given to it by Arabian stargazers, الراقص &quot;al-rāqiṣ&quot; &quot;the trotting (camel)&quot; (lit. &quot;the dancing one&quot;).

In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name &quot;Alrakis&quot; for the component Mu Draconis A on February 1, 2017, and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

This star, along with Beta Draconis (Rastaban), Gamma Draconis (Eltanin), Nu Draconis (&#x27;Kuma&#x27;) and Xi Draconis (Grumium) were &quot;Al ʽAwāïd&quot;, the Mother Camels, which were known in Latin as the Quinque Dromedarii.

== Cultural references ==
Science fiction writer Frank Herbert chose Arrakis as the name of the primary planet of Canopus (α Carinae) in his &quot;Dune&quot; series of novels, aware that the word &quot;Arrakis&quot; is the transliteration into English of the Arabic words for &quot;the Dancer&quot; (al-Raqis).

<doc id="1242478" wikidata="Q912452" url="?curid=1242478" title="Heating oil">
<text>Heating oil is any petroleum product or other oil used for heating; it is a fuel oil. Most commonly, it refers to low viscosity grades of fuel oil used for furnaces or boilers for home heating and in other buildings. Home heating oil is often abbreviated as HHO.

Most heating oil products are chemically very similar to diesel fuel used as motor fuel; motor fuel is typically subject to higher fuel taxes. Many countries add fuel dyes to heating oil, allowing law enforcement to check if a driver is evading fuel taxes. Since 2002, Solvent Yellow 124 has been added as a &quot;Euromarker&quot; in the European Union; untaxed diesel is known as &quot;red diesel&quot; in the United Kingdom.

Heating oil is commonly delivered by tank truck to residential, commercial, and municipal buildings and stored in above-ground storage tanks (&quot;ASTs&quot;) located in the basements, garages, or outside adjacent to the building. It is sometimes stored in underground storage tanks (or &quot;USTs&quot;) but less often than ASTs. ASTs are used for smaller installations due to the lower cost factor. Heating oil is less commonly used as an industrial fuel or for power generation.

Leaks from tanks and piping are an environmental concern. In the United States, various federal and state regulations are in place regarding the proper transportation, storage and burning of heating oil, which is classified as a hazardous material (HazMat) by federal regulators.

== Technical characteristics ==
Heating oil consists of a mixture of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons in the 14- to 20-carbon atom range that condense between during oil refining. Heating oil condenses at a lower temperature than petroleum jelly, bitumen, candle wax, and lubricating oil, but at a higher temperature than kerosene, which condenses between . The heavy (C20+) hydrocarbons condense between .

Heating oil produces to and weighs 8.2 pounds per US gallon (0.95 kg/L). Number 2 fuel oil has a flash point of .

Historically, the legal difference between diesel and heating oil in the United States has been sulfur allowance. Diesel for machinery and equipment must be below 15 ppm sulfur content while heating oil needed only stay below 500 ppm sulfur. However, most heating oil in the United States is now &quot;ultra-low sulfur heating oil&quot; (ULSHO) and meets the same 15 ppm standard.

== United States and Canada ==
Heating oil is known in the United States as No. 2 heating oil. In the U.S., it must conform to ASTM standard D396. Diesel and kerosene, while often confused as being similar or identical, must each conform to their respective ASTM standards. Heating oil is widely used in both the United States and Canada, with U.S. residential use most common in the northeastern states of New York and Pennsylvania and in New England, collectively accounting for 85% of total U.S. residential heating oil use. In the United States, biodiesel blends of B5 (5% biodiesel) and B20 (20% biodiesel) are available in most markets as a lower and cleaner burning heating fuel.

The heating oil futures contract trades in units of with a minimum fluctuation of $0.0001 per gallon and (for the USA) is based on delivery in New York Harbor.

The Department of Energy tracks the prices homeowners pay for home heating fuel (oil and propane). There are also a number of websites that allow home owners to compare the price per gallon they are paying with the Department of Energy data as well as other consumers in their area. Likewise the US Energy Information Administration collects heating oil price statistics and maintains historical price data for all major US markets during each heating season. The US Department of Energy also supports research and development for heating oil technology through the National Oilheat Research Alliance. Additional information about biodiesel heating oil use can also be found at the National Biodiesel Board&#x27;s site.
Heating oil is mostly used in the northeastern and northwestern urban United States and a strong market presence in rural areas as well. Most of the northeast&#x27;s heating oil comes from Irving Oil&#x27;s refinery in Saint John, New Brunswick, the largest oil refinery in Canada.

== Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland ==
Heating oil is the most common fuel for home heating in Northern Ireland due to the late development of a natural gas network. Common suppliers of heating oil in Ireland are Maxol, Patterson Oil and Emo Oil.

== England, Scotland and Wales ==
In England, Scotland and Wales, there are two types of heating oil: commercial heating oil – referring to gas oil, i.e. red diesel – and domestic heating oil – meaning kerosene, specifically BS 2869 Class C2 kerosene. Heating oil is used for home heating in England, Scotland and Wales, typically in premises away from mains gas. There are around 1.5 million people in Great Britain using oil for home heating.

Great Britain has many suppliers of heating oil ranging from large companies such as Conquest Oil Company and Crown Oil to local and independent heating oil suppliers such as J. R. Rix &amp; Sons. Many villages may use buying groups to order heating oil at the same time, thereby accessing lower costs. Many heating oil suppliers will choose to list their prices on independent heating oil price comparison websites. These sites draw in home heating oil users and compare various local supplier prices in order to provide the lowest price available. In the UK it is possible to search for prices by town name, county and postcode prefix.

The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) have referred the UK oil market to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for review. The OFT has resolved to look at the structure of the market, with a view of the fairness for consumers and alternative energy options for off-grid consumers such as heat pumps.

=== Heating oil storage regulations in the United Kingdom ===

Heating oil storage in the United Kingdom is governed by regulations that ensure the safe installation and usage of oil storage tanks. It is a criminal offence to keep a tank that violates these regulations, and the owners are liable for fines, penalties and any costs incurred as a result of cleaning up oil spills.

The regulations are designed to minimise the risk of damaging pollution and reduce the likelihood of oil being stored in hazardous environments, such as a building without proper fire safety measures. The regulations that govern oil storage tanks are The Control of Pollution (Oil Storage) England Regulations (2001), The Pollution Prevention Guidelines (PPG 2) and The Building Regulations (Approved Document J).

The Oil Storage Regulations (2001) apply to oil tanks used for commercial and industrial purposes, or domestic tanks over 3500 litres in capacity. They state that the storage tank should be of &quot;sufficient strength and structural integrity to ensure that it is unlikely to burst or leak in its ordinary use&quot;. The tank, along with any filters, gauges, valves or ancillary equipment, must be contained within a secondary unit or bund that has at least 110% of the capacity of the inner tank. If the tank has a fill pipe that is not contained within the secondary unit, a drip tray must be installed. They also require the use of an automatic overfill prevention if it is not &quot;reasonably practical&quot; to monitor the oil levels within the tank.

The Building Regulations Approved Document J covers the legal requirements for the installation of the tanks within the premises of a building. The regulations state that any new tank larger than 2,500 litres must be stored within a bunded tank or secondary containment that is a minimum of 110% of the tank&#x27;s capacity. If a tank is single skinned and smaller than 2,500 litres, it must be given an individual site pollution risk assessment. This highlights any pollution or hazard risks such as the possibility of the oil escaping and reaching a river or stream, or the risk of a collision if the storage tank is located near a road.

They further state that all tanks must be installed on a surface strong enough to support a full storage tank. The surface must be flat, even and fire-resistant, and should extend at least 300mm beyond the boundaries of the tank. A paving stone surface must be at least 42mm thick, and a concrete surface must be at least 100mm thick. The document also states that the tank should be situated at least 1800mm away from any potential hazards, such as doors, windows, appliance flue terminals, non-fire rated buildings such as garden fences, and at least 760mm from non-fire rated smaller structures such as wooden fences.

A safe, secure tank that complies with all regulations will look similar to the diagram above. It details the different parts of the tank that need to be checked in order to ensure the tank is legal, including where the ancillary equipment should be located and the presence of an automatic overfill prevention.

<text>The Jacksonville Bullets were a professional minor league ice hockey team based in Jacksonville, Florida. They played in the Sunshine Hockey League, later renamed the Southern Hockey League, from 1992–1996. They played their games at Jacksonville Coliseum and Skate World, now known as Jacksonville Ice &amp; Sportsplex.

==History==
The Bullets were founded in 1992 as one of the inaugural franchises of the Sunshine Hockey League, a start up league with six teams mostly based in Florida. They were the first ice hockey team to be based in Jacksonville in nearly twenty years, since the Jacksonville Barons of the American Hockey League had folded in 1974. They played alternately at the Jacksonville Coliseum and Skate World, a skating rink on Jacksonville&#x27;s Southside.

In 1993 GM Nick Durbano brought in former NHL goaltender Doug Keans as Head Coach and Assistant Coach David Baker. The team played barely above the .500 mark in its first season, yet found themselves in the 1993 Sunshine Cup final under coach Doug Keans. In the final the Bullets lost to the powerhouse West Palm Beach Blaze. Though often successful on the ice the Bullets struggled with attendance and finances throughout their run. In 1994 they were bought by the owners of Skate World, one of whom was Bob Sabourin, who had been the coach of Jacksonville&#x27;s first professional hockey team, the Jacksonville Rockets. They remained in the league when its name was changed to the Southern Hockey League in 1995. However, their difficulties in attracting fans were exacerbated that year with the arrival of another hockey team, the Jacksonville Lizard Kings. The Lizard Kings played in the more formidable East Coast Hockey League and had a substantially more effective marketing campaign, and were able to lease the Coliseum for their games. The Bullets managed to survive through the season, but folded along with the league at the end of the 1995–96 season. The ECHL Club followed suit a year later and folded. 

==Miscellaneous==
The radio play-by-play announcer for the Jacksonville Bullets was Howard Brigance, who was one of the founders of amateur hockey in the Jacksonville area. Brigance also did play-by-play announcing for the nearby Jacksonville Lizard Kings.

Brigance died due to a heart attack on November 29, 2004. He was 65 years old.

<text>The Glagolitic Mass (&#x27;, ; also called Missa Glagolitica or Slavonic Mass&quot;&quot;&#x27;) is a composition for soloists (soprano, contralto, tenor, bass), double chorus, organ and orchestra by Leoš Janáček. Janáček completed the work in 1926. It received its premiere by the Brno Arts Society, conducted by Jaroslav Kvapil, in Brno on 5 December 1927. Janáček revised the mass the next year.

The Glagolitic alphabet was an early Slavic alphabet, the predecessor of the modern Cyrillic alphabet. In Croatia, the Catholic Church gave permission for the Roman Rite liturgical Mass to be celebrated in Old Church Slavonic at a time when such liturgies were typically only permitted to be in Latin, resulting in the Glagolitic Use Mass.

==Background==
The text is in Old Church Slavonic, with five vocal movements that correspond to the Catholic Ordinary of the Mass, omitting &quot;Dona nobis pacem&quot; in the &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;. The musical origins of the work can be traced to Janáček&#x27;s Latin setting of the &quot;Kyrie&quot;, &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;, and &quot;Credo&quot; for organ and chorus. This was used as a dictation exercise by his composition students in 1908.

Janáček had extensive experience working with choirs, as well as writing a large amount of choral music. It begins and closes with triumphant fanfares dominated by the brass. In between these sections lies particularly vibrant and rhythmic writing for solo voices as well as choir. Curiously, the final movement is titled &quot;Intrada&quot;, which means &quot;entrance&quot;. Before this &quot;Intrada&quot;, Janáček introduces a dramatic organ solo of considerable originality – a &quot;moto perpetuo&quot; of wild energy. Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Glagolitic Mass&quot; is considered an important work of the century and is frequently performed and recorded today.

Janáček was a strong supporter of pan-Slavism, and this mass has been viewed as a celebration of Slavic culture.

Different editions of the score exist, prepared by Paul Wingfield and by Jiři Zahrádka.

==Structure==

Its eight movements are:
# &quot;Úvod&quot; – Introduction (orchestra)
# &quot;Gospodi pomiluj&quot; – Kyrie
# &quot;Slava&quot; – Gloria
# &quot;Věruju&quot; – Credo
# &quot;Svet&quot; – Sanctus
# &quot;Agneče Božij&quot; – Agnus Dei
# &quot;Varhany sólo&quot; (Postludium) – Organ solo
# &quot;Intrada&quot; – Exodus (literally, &quot;entrance&quot;)
Although this version is considered the &quot;standard&quot; version performed today, research into Janáček&#x27;s manuscripts suggests that the &quot;Intrada&quot; was intended to be played at the beginning of the work as well, creating a symmetric, nine-movement form with the &quot;Věruju&quot; at its center. In addition, several other sections of the work were revealed to have been simplified in meter and orchestration. Some of the movements are reworkings of Janáček&#x27;s earlier compositions: the &quot;Svet,&quot; for instance, is derived from the Sanctus of the &quot;Mass in E-flat&quot;.

==Orchestration==
The mass is scored for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass soloists, double SATB choir, and an orchestra of 4 flutes (2–4 doubling piccolos), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 3 clarinets (3rd doubling bass clarinet), 3 bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, glockenspiel, triangle, snare drum, cymbals, tam-tam, chimes, 2 harps, celesta, organ, and strings (1st &amp; 2nd violins, violas, cellos, and double basses).

==In film==
The &quot;Glagolitic Mass&quot; was used for the music in the 1954 film &quot;Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome&quot; by director Kenneth Anger.

==Other composers==
Other composers of a &quot;Glagolitic Mass&quot; include J. B. Foerster, František Zdeněk Skuherský, the Prague organist Bedřich Antonín Wiedermann, Karel Douša, and more recently Jan Křesadlo and Jan Hanuš. These Glagolitic Masses were mostly intended for liturgical use, prompted by the 1920 limited permission for the Roman Rite Mass to be celebrated in Church Slavonic once again in Bohemia and Moravia.

<text>HMS &quot;Hardy&quot; was an anti-submarine warfare frigate of the or Type 14. She was named after Thomas Masterman Hardy, Captain of at Trafalgar. &quot;Hardy&quot; was the first Type 14 frigate built, completed on 8 December 1955, by Yarrow Shipbuilders.

==Operational Service==

On commissioning &quot;Hardy&quot; served in the Third Training Squadron at Londonderry Port before transferring to the Second Training Squadron in Portland in 1957. In 1960 she underwent a major modernisation and refit, before joining the Twentieth Frigate Squadron in Londonderry Port. In 1967 &quot;Hardy&quot; transferred to the Second Frigate Squadron and attended Portsmouth Navy Days. The after 40 mm guns in these ships were removed early in their careers due to hull strengthening problems.

Icelandic Patrol and the First Cod War.

In January 1977, when the United Kingdom enlarged its Exclusive economic zone to , &quot;Hardy&quot; was deployed on patrols of the EEZ, protecting fishing stocks and oil fields. Serving mainly in the Londonderry Port and Portland areas, &quot;Hardy&quot; attended the 1977 Silver Jubilee Fleet Review off Spithead when she was part of the 2nd Frigate Squadron.
She paid off to the Standby Squadron in August 1977, then, after another short spell of operational service at Portland, became a stores accommodation ship in Portsmouth in October 1979.

Hardy by name and hardy by nature: she was used as a target for Exocet and Sea Skua missiles and her bow was blown off by a torpedo. Following being shelled by 4.5&quot; rounds and receiving patterns of anti submarine mortar charges set to shallow depth, both the main portion of the ship and the separated bow section were finally sunk, by the use of 20mm cannons fired from HMS Charybdis, in the Western Approaches 3 July 1984.

<doc id="1242496" wikidata="Q1469495" url="?curid=1242496" title="Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde">
<text>Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde (; ) is a judicial arrondissement encompassing the bilingual—French and Dutch—Brussels-Capital Region, which coincides with the administrative arrondissement of Brussels-Capital and the surrounding Dutch-speaking area of Halle-Vilvoorde, which in turn coincides with the administrative arrondissement of Halle-Vilvoorde. Halle-Vilvoorde contains several municipalities with language facilities, i.e. municipalities where French-speaking people form a considerable part of the population and therefore have special language rights. The arrondissement is the location of a tribunal of first instance, enterprise tribunal and a labour tribunal. 

Prior to the sixth Belgian state reform in 2012, the area also formed the electoral arrondissement of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde (BHV), which, as part of the same 2012 reform, was completely split into a Brussels electoral district and, together with the electoral district of Leuven, into the electoral district of the province of Flemish Brabant. All Belgian electoral arrondissements now coincide with the Belgian provinces. Before the splitting, BHV was an exception in the province of Flemish Brabant because of its official bilingual policy. One peculiarity remaining after the reform is that inhabitants of the six municipalities with language facilities around Brussels can still choose to vote for electoral lists of the Brussels-Capital Region. Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde has been the subject of a highly sensitive dispute within Belgium and was one of the main topics of the 2007–2011 Belgian political crisis. A majority of the Flemings wanted to split it into two arrondissements (like the administrative ones), while the Francophones wanted to keep it as it was or, at a minimum, split it with concessions.

The lists for the federal and European elections were composed of both Dutch and French-language parties (in all other electoral areas it is either Dutch or French-language parties), while the area is partly monolingual Halle-Vilvoorde and bilingual Brussels. Consequently, French-speakers living in the officially monolingual Dutch-speaking electoral district of Leuven in Flanders could vote for French-language parties in BHV, and Dutch-speakers living in the officially monolingual French-speaking electoral district Nivelles in Walloon Brabant could vote for Dutch-language parties in BHV. In 2003, the Court of Arbitration ruled the BHV district to be unconstitutional, citing unequal voting rights. It was abolished as part of the 2012 sixth Belgian state reform.

==Background history==

The Brussels judicial and electoral arrondissement, corresponding to what became later Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde, has existed since the Belgian Revolution in 1830, when the country was created as a unitary state. At that time, French was the only language in politics, administration, justice, the army and all education except primary, to the disadvantage of Dutch speakers. Some Dutch speakers therefore decided to raise their children in French. Discrimination of the Dutch language started to lessen from the end of the 19th century onwards and came to a complete end in 1967, the year in which the Belgian Constitution got an official Dutch version.

Belgium, as a unitary state, consisted of nine provinces with several arrondissements. Each arrondissement also served as an electoral district, however some of them were later grouped together. One of the nine provinces was Brabant, which consisted of the arrondissements of Brussels, Leuven and Nivelles. Upon the fixation of the language border in 1963, the arrondissement of Brussels was split into the bilingual arrondissement of Brussels-Capital and the unilingual Halle-Vilvoorde, but was retained as grouped arrondissements forming the electoral district of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde. Furthermore, nothing in the judicial structure was reformed, leaving the judicial arrondissement of Brussels unchanged. In the course of history, the administrative and political situation in Belgium has changed considerably and BHV has grown to become a major exception within the contemporary federal state of Belgium.

===1920s–1960s===
====Dynamic system====
In 1921 Belgium was divided into two monolingual entities (French-speaking Wallonia and Dutch-speaking Flanders). Both languages could be used in Brussels (16 municipalities at that time). A special status was established wherever a large minority used the other language along the linguistic border.

The Belgian law of 28 June 1932 on &quot;the use of languages for administrative matters&quot; reinforced the 1921 law and based the language status of every Belgian municipality on the decennial linguistic census. The criterion to belong to the Dutch-speaking or French-speaking language area was the attainment of a threshold of 50%; whereas, over 30% the municipal authorities had to offer services in the minority language as well. A municipality could ask the government to change its linguistic status by a royal decree only after a census would have shown a passage over the 30% or 50% threshold.

The 1932 law was implemented only once. As the invasion of Belgium by Germany in 1940 prevented the organization of the decennial census, the next (and last) linguistic census took place in 1947. The results suggested that the progression of French language had kept intensifying. These results were disputed by Flemish politicians who questioned the survey methodology. The percentage of Dutch-speakers had fallen under the 30% threshold in nine municipalities while 12 and nine municipalities had respectively passed over the threshold of 50% and 30% French-speakers. Only one municipality (Rekkem) had fallen under the threshold of 30% French-speakers. In order to mitigate their impact, the results of the 1947 census were not made public until 1954; after that an ad hoc law modifying the 1932 law was voted. Around Brussels, the three municipalities where French-speakers had passed the 50% threshold were transferred to the bilingual area of Brussels (Evere, Ganshoren and Berchem-Sainte-Agathe/Sint-Agatha-Berchem), and language facilities were granted to French-speakers in four of the five municipalities where the percentage of French-speakers had passed the 30% threshold (Drogenbos, Kraainem, Wemmel and Linkebeek).

There are no official figures to support claims, on the French-speaking side, that many more families shifted from Dutch to French after 1947. On the Flemish side, as the decennial linguistic census and the dynamic system were seen as a serious threat to their cultural territory; politicians began opposing them and Flemish mayors boycotted the 1960 census.

====Static system====
In order to offset Flemish fears of uninterrupted progression of the French language into the Dutch-speaking area, a deal was struck in 1961–1962, during the Lefèvre-Spaak government; that the language border would be officially fixed and would not be changed. The linguistic census and dynamic system would be abolished and replaced with a static system: the linguistic status of every municipality would be fixed once and for all.

However, the process of deciding on the geographical position of such a static linguistic border led to bitter resentment, by both communities, including within political parties which had transcended language cleavages until then. Instead of reflecting the usual left/right divide, the laws which fixed the position of the linguistic border were voted (in 1962 and 1963) by the majority formed by Flemish members in Parliament against the minority formed by their French-speaking counterparts.

These laws voted in 1962 and 1963:

Bilingual Brussels was limited to the 19 municipalities it already encompassed since 1954.

In the Flemish Halle and Vilvoorde, out of the seven municipalities where French-speakers had reached between 27% and 48% at the census of 1947, 4 kept the extended linguistic and political facilities they had been granted in 1954 and two more were granted the same (Wezembeek-Oppem and Sint-Genesius-Rode/Rhode-Saint-Genèse). (Arguing that since 1947 many more people had shifted from Dutch to French, French-speaking Members of Parliament demanded that those six municipalities to be detached from the Dutch-speaking area and added to bilingual Brussels, which was fiercely resisted by their Flemish counterparts.)

The same arrangement was made for a number of municipalities on new the border between the Dutch- and French-speaking areas, where local linguistic minorities could enjoy identical facilities: e.g. Flobecq and Enghien in the French-speaking area (where the Dutch-speaking minorities had reached respectively 7.2% and 12.1% in 1947); and Voeren/Fourons in the Dutch-speaking area (where the French-speaking population had reached 56.9% in 1947).

In 1964, the Fédéralistes Démocrates Francophones (FDF), a party advocating the extension of Brussels, was founded. By 1970 all Belgian political parties had split into Dutch-speaking and French-speaking parties. The position of the linguistic border was endorsed in the 1970 State Reform (requiring a two-thirds majority) and, in return for contributing to this endorsement, the French-speaking minority was granted new measures which included the requirement of a &quot;special majority&quot; (a two-thirds majority in total and at least 50% in each linguistic group) to pass such laws as those of 1962 and 1963 in future; and (article 54) the possibility for any linguistic group to block a bill and open negotiations when it considers that such bill seriously jeopardizes its interests.

According to the French-speaking parties, the compromise also included an agreement that in the future the existing voting and judicial opportunities for the large French-speaking minority around Brussels would be maintained and that the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde electoral and judicial arrondissement would remain unimpaired. The Flemish parties deny this, saying that this was never the intention. Importantly, these opportunities are not enshrined in the Constitution, but in law, and can be amended by a simple majority.

Consequently, Bills intended at splitting the BHV arrondissement have been put forward several times and countered as many times by the French-speaking minority on grounds of the article 54 of the Belgian Constitution.

===1970s–1990s===
The 1970 State reform also created the Dutch, French and German Cultural Communities and laid the foundations for the establishment of three Regions.

Later on, in 1980, the Cultural Communities became known as Communities. Also two regions were established: the Flemish Region and the Walloon Region. Although the creation of a Brussels Region was provided for in 1970, the Brussels-Capital Region was not established until a later reform.
The province of Brabant had been one of the nine provinces of Belgium. But due to the arrangement of the linguistic border, which passes through this province, the province was abolished after several reforms:

In 1989 Brussels-Capital Region was created, but the region was still part of the province of Brabant.

With the reform in 1993 making Belgium into a federal state, Brabant became part of all three regions: the Brussels, Flemish and Walloon Region.

Until 1995, the province of Brabant contained the following electoral arrondissements:
* the Dutch-speaking electoral arrondissement of Leuven (coinciding with the administrative arrondissement of Leuven)
* the French-speaking electoral arrondissement of Nivelles (coinciding with the administrative arrondissement of Nivelles)
* the electoral arrondissement of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde (coinciding with both the administrative arrondissement Brussels-Capital and Halle-Vilvoorde).
In 1995, this province was split into:
* the province of Flemish Brabant
* the province of Walloon Brabant (which coincides to the arrondissement of Nivelles)
* Brussels-Capital Region, an own bilingual region (the other two regions being the unilingual Flanders and Wallonia)
However, the arrondissements stayed the same.

===Elections of 2003===

====New electoral districts====
For the elections in 2003, new electoral districts were created based on the provinces instead of arrondissements, because the electoral areas were too small. With regards to Brussels and the arrondissements of the province of Flemish Brabant the old arrondissements (Leuven and BHV) were retained (Walloon Brabant has only one arrondissement, so this is in fact also retained), since the French-speakers are against splitting BHV.

====BHV is declared unconstitutional====
In 2003, one week after the election, the Arbitration Court (, ), now the Constitutional Court of Belgium, declared the new election law unconstitutional. It judged that, among other things, the definition of the electoral arrondissement Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde for national and European elections is a violation of the non-discrimination principle between Belgians, taken in combination with articles 1 to 5 of the Constitution (especially article 4, defining the language areas).

However, it left open the precise nature of any solution and thus did not demand the splitting of the electoral district but did not allow it to be kept as it is now.

Nevertheless, the Court declared the results of the 2003 elections (already held under the law declared unconstitutional) to be valid to avoid having to redo the elections.

The court however did not rule on all aspects of constitutionality. Among other things, it did not rule on the fact that some French-speakers now enjoy &quot;de facto&quot; rights that Flemish do not. This applies mainly to the fact that a French-speaker from Brussels who moves into a commune in the Flemish Region can still continue to vote for French-speaking Brussels candidates, but a Fleming who moves into the (equally) monolingual Walloon Region cannot vote any longer for his Flemish candidates of choice from the two regions where Dutch is an official language (Flemish Region and Brussels Region).

An element of discrimination is that French-speaking candidates from Brussels can compete for votes in a part of Flanders without being subject to the entire valid legislation (only the Belgian laws but not to the Flemish laws applicable in Flemish region), but Flemish candidates in the Walloon Region always have to obey both Belgian and regional/community legislation.

Following the ruling of the Constitutional Court, after having remained unsolved after decades, the BHV issue was suddenly a hot topic.

With the elections for the Flemish Parliament in 2004, all Flemish parties added to their programs the demand to split BHV. In the Flemish coalition agreement of 2004, the issue was included as &quot;to be realised immediately&quot;, signed by the three large Flemish parties Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&amp;V), Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) and Different Socialist Party (SP.A), in addition to the Flemish-nationalist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) (the at that time CD&amp;V cartel partner) and the left-liberal Spirit (the at that time SP.A cartel partner).

Although the Flemish government and the Flemish parliament have no legal power concerning the case, the issue was seen as a commitment of the governing parties at a federal level, VLD and SP.A, to settle the case in the federal government.

==Current arrangements and organisation in BHV==

===Electoral arrondissement===
;Elections of the Senate and of the European Parliament
:Electors can choose between the lists competing for seats in the Dutch-speaking electoral college and for those running for seats in the French-speaking electoral college, whereas in other electoral arrondissements, electors can vote only on the list of the language area in which they live.

==== Elections of the Chamber ====

:Because the former arrondissements still exist in Brabant (see the previous section(s) for more information) there is a special arrangement for the provinces of Flemish and Walloon Brabant: for the allocation of seats between the party lists on the level of the former province of Brabant, lists can be combined between Leuven and Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde (Dutch-speaking parties do this) or between Nivelles and Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde (French-speaking parties do this). This practice is known in French as &quot;apparentement&quot; and in Dutch as &quot;apparentering&quot;.

Voters can choose between candidates from both Flemish and Walloon parties (in all other electoral areas it is either Flemish or Walloon parties), although the area is partly monolingual Halle-Vilvoorde (belonging to the Flemish Community) and bilingual Brussels (belonging to both communities), and consequently French-speakers living in monolingual Dutch-speaking Halle-Vilvoorde can vote for French-language parties, whereas Dutch-speakers living in monolingual French-speaking Walloon Brabant (equal to the former electoral arrondissement of Nivelles) cannot vote for Dutch-language parties.

This is discrimination according to the Flemish. The Flemish want to split BHV, while French-speakers are opposed to such a split unless parts of the compromise reached in 1970 on the static system (see above) are revised at the same time. From the francophone point of view, the maintenance of the BHV district was a part of the 1970 compromise. Flemish demands for the area to be split are met with demands by the Francophone community for the six special-facility communes to be officially added to Brussels proper. This Francophone demand would create a previously non-existent &quot;corridor&quot; between the French-speaking region of Wallonia and majority French-speaking Brussels, much to the dismay of Flemish politicians.

;Belgians who live abroad may choose in which electoral arrondissement they are registered.
:The majority of the French-speakers abroad do so in BHV, according to N-VA. Whatever the case may be, for the elections of 2007 the governor of the province of Flemish Brabant (instructed by the Flemish Minister of Administrative Affairs) stroke out from the lists of registered voters in BHV, all expatriates who had filled their voter’s registration form in French, including those who had registered in Municipalities with language facilities (where communication with the local and federal administration is normally allowed in either language). Likewise, for the elections of 2010, Belgian expatriates who had filled their voter’s registration form in French were stricken out from the lists, including in the municipality with language facilities of Sint-Genesius-Rode / Rhode-Saint-Genèse.

===Judicial arrondissement===
Since this is one judicial arrondissement, a legal case can be handled by both Dutch-speaking and French-speaking judges. This causes a problem comparable with the electoral situation: Brussels is bilingual, and Halle-Vilvoorde is monolingual Dutch, so it is possible that a French judge is appointed a legal case from the Dutch-speaking Halle-Vilvoorde region, which is unfair from a Flemish point of view. The fact that Brussels has a more extensive court network, for example the Law Courts of Brussels, adds to this issue.

===Municipalities===

The arrondissement consists of the following municipalities (in total accounting for around 1,595,000 inhabitants on 1 January 2006):
====Halle-Vilvoorde====
====Brussels====
(names are written in respectively French and Dutch)
==Points of view==
===Flemish point of view===
Many legal experts in Flanders, such as and Matthias Storme, argue that there is no way out, other than splitting BHV, that will respect the entire Belgian constitution.

On the political level, Flemings argue that French-speakers who choose to live in Flanders should respect the Flemish institutions, legislation and official language (Dutch), and should stop requesting an exceptional status (of not having to respect the Flemish institutions that are constitutionally established and internationally recognized). French-speakers are asked to respect the division of Belgium into four linguistic areas, a democratically approved division with the support of a majority of French-speaking members of the Belgian parliament.

Flemings say that they want the same level of respect for their institutions as is the case everywhere else in the European Union.

===Francophone point of view ===
Just as unanimously, at least among the political parties, most French-speaking politicians claim that those French-speakers who live in the Flemish Region should have the right to be treated as a linguistic minority that falls under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.
This would then give them a kind of an &quot;extraterritorial&quot; voting right.

This point of view differs sharply from many French-speaking businessman and academics. &#x27;Beci&#x27;, a Brussels-based employers organisation with 90% membership of French-speaking businessmen, explicitly states it respects all the existing institutions, including the boundaries between the language areas. Similarly, a growing number of French-speaking intellectuals and academics state that French-speakers living in the Flemish region should stop behaving as if they are not in Flanders and thus vote for the Flemish electoral college.

Philippe Van Parijs, a leading French-speaking philosopher and economist from the UCL also defends strict &#x27;territoriality&#x27; and for ending both the linguistic facilities and the &#x27;extraterritorial&#x27; voting rights for French-speakers living in the Flemish Region. He defended it in an interview in De Standaard and Le Soir on 23 August 2007.

===Legal and political considerations===
There is a lack of consensus in national legal authorities about this subject as they seem divided between French and Dutch speakers. The French-speaking Community and the Flemish Community have a different interpretation of the language facilities enjoyed by the French-speaking population in some municipalities.

There are binding rulings (as early as from 1968) from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, an institution with direct authority in all EU states, to confirm that the recognition of specific minority rights for the French-speakers is to be limited to a very few number of municipalities and to a limited set of public services.

Regular supra-national recommendations from the Council of Europe, a body without direct authority and therefore a lesser status in the legal order in Belgium, expressed concerns in 2002 that the minority of French speakers in Flanders should be recognized and protected as an official linguistic minority, as defined by advise of the Venice Commission. However, other reports from this institution provide arguments to the contrary (e.g. the fact that the francophones in Flanders cannot be regarded as looking back on longstanding and peaceful relations with the Flemish authorities). Also, they cannot be regarded as being &quot;sufficient in numbers&quot; within the Council&#x27;s definition so as to constitute a linguistic minority within Flanders.

Flemish authorities have stated that the recommendations from the Council of Europe are invalid as they did not take into account the Belgian constitution or the European jurisprudence, which confirms a very limited definition of the &#x27;language facilities&#x27;. As such, the Council of Europe and especially its &#x27;rapporteurs&#x27;, appear to be neglecting the special character of Belgium. It should also be noted that, the French language minority around Brussels is of quite recent origin (see Francization of Brussels). There is no &#x27;historic French-speaking minority&#x27; in these areas.

==Negotiations and attempts to split BHV==

===Government negotiations 2004–2005===
In 2005, cabinet ministers and parties had been locked in debate over the future of this electoral district, and long-overdue decisions had not been reached.

Compromise solutions have been proposed:

* BHV could be joined to the neighbouring Flemish electoral district of Leuven, allowing greater numbers of Dutch speakers a vote in a combined Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde-Leuven district.
* In return for leaving BHV in its current state, one might accomplish Flemish demands for specific powers currently under federal jurisdiction to be conferred to the Regions.

A deadline of 11 May 2005, by which time a decision was to be reached, expired without a compromise. A compromise worked out by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt was explicitly opposed by only one coalition partner, namely the Flemish party Spirit. It is believed that this compromise would have entitled the French Community with the right to exercise certain, limited powers over inhabitants of the Flemish Community, in return for the splitting of BHV.

After visiting King Albert II to report the failure of the seven negotiation meetings to reach a successful conclusion, the Prime Minister requested a vote of confidence from the parliament. The Parliament supported the government on 13 May 2005 and the issue was put on hold until the next general election in 2007.

===Elections in 2007===
With the federal elections of 10 June 2007 looming, the problem of the electoral district of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde reemerged. Because the federal government failed to comply with a ruling of the Court of Arbitration that declared the provincial electoral districts compared to the two remaining arrondisemental ones in the former province of Brabant unconstitutional, several mayors in the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde area have threatened to refuse to compile the lists of electors.

Professor and constitutional expert from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven declared that the elections, held on 10 June were unconstitutional for two reasons:

*As the previous election was held on 18 May 2003, the final date to hold elections (four years from the previous) was 13 May 2007.
*The Court of Arbitration gave the government the time to fix the BHV problem until the next elections were scheduled; otherwise, the election results were supposed to be declared void.

As in 2003, several mayors and groupings have called for a boycott of the elections, and 24 communes have refused to cooperate in the organization of the elections. In May 2007, the municipality of Steenokkerzeel launched a court case against the federal government for not complying with the ruling of the Court of Arbitration. The case should have started on 25 May 2007 but the case was mistakenly scheduled in a one-judge court room rather than a three-judge court room and so was delayed.

===2007–2008 formation of the government===
The problem of BHV became an important issue in the 2007–2008 Belgian government formation. On 7 November 2007, the Flemish parties voted at the Committee on the Interior of the Chamber of Representatives for the disentanglement, while the French-speaking parties refused to vote and left the room. This situation has never previously occurred in Belgian history. All representatives of the Flemish parties voted in favor of the split of the BHV electoral district, with the exception of Tinne van der Straeten, of Groen!, the Flemish green party, who abstained.

This situation shows that the Belgian debate goes far beyond legal quarrels about BHV; as the power of Walloon institutions decrease (and this since its industrial breakdown in the late 1960s) and as the Flemish government clearly consolidates its ideological orientation toward a situation of cultural domination, supported by demographic and financial matters. Every step in the Belgian debate can be interpreted symbolically as a fight between two cultures that might show mutual respect only when they can be protected from each other&#x27;s domination.

On 23 December, the interim Government officially came into office. The transitional period came to an end on 20 March 2008, when Yves Leterme was sworn in as Prime Minister of the Leterme I Government. Negotiations continued, but again no solution was reached, and Leterme offered the King his resignation on 15 July 2008, but the King refused.

===Elections in 2010===
The newly appointed Flemish President of the Constitutional Court Marc Bossuyt has stated that federal elections (after 2007) would be deemed &quot;unconstitutional&quot; if a legal arrangement for Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde were not put into place by then.

According to Article 65 of the Belgian Constitution, the Federal Parliament ends after four years, automatically leading to new federal elections within 40 days. This means the next federal elections were scheduled for 2011.

In April 2010, the Flemish liberal VLD withdrew themselves from the government because no solution was found for the problem of BHV at the agreed upon date and so caused the collapse of the Leterme II Government. Consequently, new elections had to be set up, resulting in the general elections of June 2010.

For these elections, several mayors in Halle-Vilvoorde started a legal procedure because BHV was still not solved, and they refused to organise the elections in their municipalities, as with the previous two federal elections. The province of Flemish Brabant organised the elections instead.

After these general elections, the next government will have to find a solution for BHV. N-VA, the winner and now largest party of Flanders and Belgium, want to split BHV without concessions for French speakers. During the 2010 Belgian government formation, a solution for BHV has been part of a larger agreement. Mid-September 2011 a tentative agreement was reached to partially split the district.

==Agreement and consequences of splitting BHV==
As part of the sixth Belgian state reform, the electoral district has been split and the judicial arrondissement has been reformed. On 13 July 2012 the Belgian Chamber of Representatives voted the laws (106-42) regarding the splitting of BHV. On 19 July 2012, the laws were signed by King Albert II in a public ceremony.

===Electoral district===
The BHV electoral district is split, and the Halle-Vilvoorde electoral area is merged with the Leuven electoral area, forming a single provincial constituency corresponding to the province of Flemish Brabant; and the Brussels electoral area became a new separate single constituency corresponding to the Brussels Region.

Inhabitants living in Halle-Vilvoorde, whether French-speaking or Dutch speaking, lost the possibility to vote for politicians from Brussels during the federal elections. However, the inhabitants of the six Flemish municipalities around Brussels with French language facilities, being Linkebeek, Wezembeek-Oppem, Kraainem, Drogenbos, Wemmel and Sint-Genesius-Rode, are given the opportunity to choose their vote on a list either from Brussels or from Flemish Brabant, but are not allowed to vote for both.

French-speaking parties of HV would need to form one francophone list to be able to gain a seat in the federal parliament, and French-speaking politicians from Brussels will lose votes that they would otherwise gain in the Flemish periphery around Brussels.

Dutch-speaking parties in Brussels would need to form one Flemish list or form an electoral list alliance to be able to gain one or two seats in the federal parliament, and Dutch-speaking politicians of the whole BHV area will lose votes that they would otherwise gain in Brussels (the number of Dutch-speakers roughly corresponds to two out of the seven seats Brussels would be allocated proportionally by population).

===Judicial district===
For language use in judicial matters, the Halle-Vilvoorde part will align with the language use in the Flemish Region so that all judicial matters are handled in Dutch, as it is the sole official language of the Flemish Region. The status concerning the Brussels Region will not change, as Brussels is a bilingual region; matters will still be handled in either French or Dutch.

According to , the head of the federal judicial police, splitting BHV could have negative effects for the safety in the area, since criminals based in Brussels (an officially bilingual but mostly French-speaking city) often act in the Dutch-speaking area around it and would have to be judged in Dutch-speaking courts of the Flemish Region.

There has been criticism of the agreement, for example a Brussels lawyer noting that it is startlingly complex, difficult to accomplish and very disadvantageous to Flanders.

<text>The Canada–Central American Four Free Trade Agreement was a proposed free trade agreement between Canada and the Central American states of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua (collectively referred to as the Central American Four or CA4). Twelve rounds of negotiations were undertaken between 2001 and 2010, after which no agreement had been reached. Canada and Honduras instead decided to pursue a bilateral agreement between themselves, and those negotiations concluded successfully in August 2011.

The United States negotiated and ratified a similar treaty with these countries, called the Central American Free Trade Agreement. In a referendum on October 7, 2007, the voters of Costa Rica narrowly backed the free trade agreement with the U.S., with about 52 percent of &quot;Yes&quot; votes.

<doc id="1242523" wikidata="Q7335751" url="?curid=1242523" title="Ripsaw (newspaper)">
<text>Ripsaw (sometimes called Rip-Saw, RipSaw or The Duluth Rip-Saw) was a Duluth, Minnesota newspaper published from 1917 to 1926 and relaunched from 1999 to 2005. The paper was a scandal sheet during the first years of publication, with a reputation for muckraking, sensationalism and criminal libel. The revival was similar in tone, though the publishers changed.

== The Great Family Journal ==
The original Duluth &quot;Ripsaw&quot; was founded by John L. Morrison, a fundamentalist Christian who abhorred alcohol, gambling and prostitution. The paper debuted on March 24, 1917. Issues were published every other Saturday, with copies sold at newsstands for five cents. The newspaper&#x27;s offices were originally in downtown Duluth&#x27;s Fargusson Building, and later moved to the Phoenix Building.

Morrison produced the &quot;Ripsaw&quot; almost entirely by himself. Three known helpers were stenographer Alice B. Bartlett, a cartoonist who signed his work &quot;Webster,&quot; and Isadore Cohen, a pre-teenaged newsboy who hawked papers in front of the old St. Louis County State Bank. Other writers were also periodically featured, but the vast majority of the work was always done by Morrison, who called himself the &quot;head sawyer&quot; of the &quot;Great Family Journal.&quot;

The &quot;Ripsaw&quot; began shortly after St. Louis County outlawed the sale of alcohol. When Superior, Wisconsin, followed a few months later with its own voter-instituted prohibition, the Twin Ports were nominally dry, but alcohol was available at bootleg outlets and in townships nearby. Local politicians and police did little to enforce the prohibition, and Morrison ridiculed them for it in the &quot;Ripsaw&quot;. He also editorialized in favor of streetcars, public toilets and higher pay for policemen.

During the &quot;Ripsaw&quot;&#x27;s first year, Duluth Chief of Police Robert McKercher and City Auditor &quot;King&quot; Odin Halden were both ousted from their positions after being labeled crooked in the &quot;Ripsaw&quot;.

Microfilm copies of the &quot;Ripsaw&quot; are located in the Duluth Public Library and in the Library of the Minnesota Historical Society in St. Paul, for researchers interested in reading specific articles from the paper.

== Morrison&#x27;s demise ==
The &quot;Ripsaw&quot;&#x27;s decline began with the October 25, 1924 issue. Morrison accused State Senator Mike Boylan of threatening him with mayhem and death, Cass County Probate Judge Bert Jamison of having acquired syphilis at a brothel and Victor L. Power, a former mayor of Hibbing, of corrupt legal practices and a weakness for women and whiskey. All three retaliated.

Morrison was arrested by a sheriff from Walker, Minnesota (the county seat of Cass County) on charges of criminal libel brought by Jamison. Morrison was sentenced to 90 days in the Cass County jail, but raised bail and returned to Duluth pending appeal.

While Morrison was held in Cass County, Power instigated criminal and civil libel actions, claiming the October 25 &quot;Ripsaw&quot; article was written for the sole purpose of injuring him politically. The Duluth police held a warrant for Morrison&#x27;s arrest pending his release from the Cass County jail. A jury in Hibbing, Minnesota, found him guilty, and he was sentenced to 90 days in the county workhouse. He immediately appealed. Later, Morrison was ordered to make a public apology to Power. The charges against him were dropped and his sentence rescinded. Later that month, Morrison pleaded guilty to the charges of criminal libel brought by Jamison.

The most powerful blow to the &quot;Great Family Journal&quot; came in the summer of 1925. Senator Boylan, who, according to the Oct. 25, 1924 &quot;Ripsaw&quot;, had threatened to kill Morrison, was trying to have the paper shut down. He worked with Rep. George Lommen to draft several bills allowing suppression of scandalous newspapers. Sen. Freyling Stevens, a powerful lawyer, introduced the senate version of what would become known as the &quot;Minnesota gag law,&quot; for which he is credited with authorship.

The Public Nuisance Bill of 1925 was approved by the Minnesota Senate and House of Representatives. It allowed a single judge, without jury, to stop a newspaper or magazine from publishing, forever.

Governor Theodore Christianson signed the Public Nuisance Law, but Morrison was unaware of this change. On April 6, 1926, the &quot;Ripsaw&quot; attacked Minneapolis Mayor George Emerson Leach: &quot;Minnesotans do not want loose-love governor.&quot; In the next issue, Duluth Commissioner of Public Utilities W. Harlow Tischer was the target: &quot;Tischer and his gang fail to establish graft plan.&quot;

Morrison was served with a warrant for his arrest based on a complaint from Leach under an obscene-literature ordinance recently rushed through the Minneapolis City Council. The next day, a temporary restraining order was placed on the &quot;Ripsaw&quot; by State District Judge H. J. Grannis of Duluth. Tischer claimed that the charges of graft were untrue and he demanded that the &quot;Ripsaw&quot; be stopped. The Finnish Publishing Company, which printed the &quot;Ripsaw&quot;, was also named in the injunction, and news dealers and newsboys were barred from distributing the paper.

Morrison&#x27;s trial was set for May 15, 1926. Morrison did not appear in court, as he had fallen ill. On May 18, 1926, Morrison was rushed to St. Francis Hospital in Superior at around 1 a.m. Nine hours later, he was pronounced dead. The cause was reported in the &quot;Duluth Herald&quot; to be an embolism, a blood clot on the brain. The Herald reported that Morrison &quot;had been ill for 10 days, suffering from pleurisy following an attack of influenza, a general breakdown and attacks of syncope.&quot;

Tischer continued to insist the injunction against the &quot;Ripsaw&quot; be maintained, even after Morrison&#x27;s death. Judge E. J. Kenney, however, allowed a continuation of the &quot;Ripsaw&quot; &quot;without the articles objected to by Commissioner Tischer.&quot;

On June 1, 1931, the &quot;gag law&quot; was found to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, in what is considered to be the first and most important freedom of the press decision in U.S. history.

== Rebirth ==
The &quot;Ripsaw&quot; returned in January 1999. Brad Nelson and Cord R. Dada published a monthly scandal sheet similar to Morrison&#x27;s original &quot;Ripsaw&quot;. Its first lead story, &quot;Dotygate,&quot; accused Duluth Mayor Gary Doty and his administration of various crimes associated with the demolition of buildings on East First Street to make way for construction of the Duluth Technology Village.

The &quot;Ripsaw&quot; became a weekly publication on April 5, 2000. Paul Lundgren was hired as managing editor and the paper was transformed into an alternative news, arts and entertainment source. One year later, it was accepted into the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies.

While Morrison&#x27;s original &quot;Ripsaw&quot; fought for temperance, the new &quot;Ripsaw&quot; reveled in the exploits of Slim Goodbuzz, who wrote a &quot;Barfly on the Wall&quot; column.

The comic strip &quot;Violet Days,&quot; by Chris Monroe, which is now featured in the &quot;Minneapolis Star Tribune&quot; and &quot;Duluth News Tribune&quot;, first appeared in the &quot;Ripsaw&quot; reincarnation.

Co-publisher Cord R. Dada sold the majority of his ownership in the paper to Brad Nelson&#x27;s brother Tim Nelson in April 2001, relieving himself of all duties at the &quot;Ripsaw&quot; and leaving Brad Nelson as the majority owner and sole publisher of the paper. Within a few months, Lundgren was dismissed and Nelson became editor/publisher.

The last weekly issue was published on Dec. 31, 2003. Three months later, the &quot;Ripsaw&quot; returned to monthly status, this time as a full-color magazine edited by Tony Dierckins. It lasted 10 issues before reverting to newsprint for its final three issues, which were published every other month, ending in September 2005.

== Spinoffs ==
Barrett Chase and Scott Lunt founded the website &quot;Perfect Duluth Day&quot; in 2003. Chase was a cartoonist and copy editor for the &quot;Ripsaw&quot;, and Lunt helped deliver the paper. Former &quot;Ripsaw&quot; Managing Editor Paul Lundgren became a part-owner of &quot;Perfect Duluth Day&quot; in 2009, as did freelance illustrator Brian Barber.

The &quot;Ripsaw&quot;&#x27;s former &quot;Web Jërk&quot; and Assistant Art Director Adam Guggemos went on to found Duluth&#x27;s weekly &quot;Transistor&quot; in 2004, which featured columns and comic strips by former &quot;Ripsaw&quot; contributors.

<doc id="1242527" wikidata="Q6070683" url="?curid=1242527" title="Irish Daily Star">
<text>The Irish Daily Star (formerly known simply as &quot;The Star&quot;) is a tabloid newspaper published in Ireland by Reach plc, which owns the British &quot;Daily Star&quot;.

The &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot; became known for its comprehensive in-depth coverage of and thorough focus on crime, often featuring sensational coverage. It also focuses heavily on celebrity matters, and has a large sports section. Between 2003 and 2011, a Sunday edition was published, as Irish Daily Star Sunday. Like its British tabloid counterpart, the &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot; has a red-top mast head.

==History==
First published on 29 February 1988, nominally the paper was the Irish version of the UK tabloid &quot;Daily Star&quot;. It did, however, contain more Irish content than any similar Irish editions of the UK national newspapers. The tabloid had strong nationalist leanings, claiming on its slogan to be &quot;Better... because we&#x27;re Irish&quot;.

The newspaper&#x27;s offices were located in Terenure, Dublin 6W, until November 2010. They then relocated to Building 4 of the Dundrum Town Centre complex. &quot;The Star&quot; employs 70 staff directly. The controlling editor of the paper for many years was Gerard Colleran, who often appears on television programmes such as &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot;. Michael O&#x27;Kane took over from Colleran as editor of the &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot; on 25 November 2011. Colleran then became managing director of the tabloid.

In September 2018, Reach plc, publisher of the &quot;Mirror&quot;, acquired the 50% stake formally owned by Northern &amp; Shell.

In April 2020, the editor Eoin Brannigan left the &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot;.

In July 2020, it was announced that Independent News &amp; Media had reached an agreement to sell their 50% stake in Independent Star to Reach plc. The agreement is subject to competition authority approval and is expected to close in late 2020.

In November 2020, the acquisition of the 50% stake owned by Independent News &amp; Media was approved by the regulator and the minister.

==Content==
While the &quot;Daily Star&quot; (UK) focuses almost exclusively on celebrity content, the &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot; includes mostly coverage of Irish issues and sport.

In Northern Ireland, &quot;The Irish Star&quot; features a green masthead, in order to distinguish it from the UK version which is also sold there. It also differs from the &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot; in that it features more news about Northern Ireland.

In USA, the &quot;Irish Star&quot; features a green masthead, and features news about Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;irishstar.com/about&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;IrishStar.com&quot; began in February 2023 using the tagline, &quot;The Voice of Irish America&quot;.

==Circulation==
According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, Ireland, the average daily circulation of the &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot;:

==Business==
The 2011 accounts showed that &quot;The Irish Daily Star&quot; made a profit of €1.44 million for 2011, this was down 63% year-on-year. Revenue was down 20% year-on-year. The company shed 20 staff in 2011, bringing its employment to 118.

Staffing numbers were down to 110 in January 2013, with 80 of those posts full-time and 9 job cuts pending.

Staff numbers reduced to 50 by 31 December 2017.

== Kate Middleton photographs and subsequent reorganisation (2012/2013) ==
The &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot; published controversial topless pictures of Kate Middleton on 15 September 2012. St James&#x27;s Palace said there could be &quot;no motivation for this action other than greed&quot;. Editor Michael O&#x27;Kane defended the publication, saying to the BBC: &quot;I did this as a service to our readers, I&#x27;m a little taken aback by the reaction in the UK. It only seems to be an issue in the UK because she is your future queen. But from our point of view in Ireland, Kate Middleton is just another of the fantastic line of celebrities&quot;.

In response to the publication of the topless photographs of Kate Middleton, later that day Northern &amp; Shell, the co-owner of the &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot;, announced it was &quot;taking immediate steps to close down the joint venture&quot;.

On 17 September 2012, editor Michael O&#x27;Kane was suspended pending an investigation into the matter. The following day, it was reported that the &quot;Northern &amp; Shell company was indicating that the company&#x27;s focus was on exiting the publishing joint venture&quot; rather than closure specifically. It was subsequently reported, that the contract between Northern &amp; Shell and Independent News &amp; Media allows either one of them to give notice of an intention to withdraw and that lawyers from Northern &amp; Shell were trying to extricate Desmond&#x27;s company from the agreement.

On 24 November 2012, Michael O&#x27;Kane resigned as editor of the &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot;. The same day, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that IN&amp;M and N&amp;S were working together &quot;to secure the future of the newspaper&quot; and that there was &quot;no change to the status of the 25-year-old joint venture&quot; but that there will be further changes, to be announced in the future, at the paper. The following day, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that the changes will be &quot;rationalisation&quot; in nature and would be announced over the coming weeks.

On 10 January 2013, the reorganisation was announced. IN&amp;M assumed full executive responsibility for the &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot;. These included pay cuts for all staff, nine staff redundancies and cost cuts of overheads. The &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot; will relocate to Talbot Street in Dublin from its current offices in Dundrum. Gerry Lennon has been appointed managing director of the &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot; in addition to his existing role of managing director of the &quot;Sunday World&quot;.

The &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot; is also going to start sharing some functions with the Sunday World.

<text>McAlmont &amp; Butler are an English rock/soul music duo, comprising singer David McAlmont and guitarist Bernard Butler.

==History==
Formed in 1994, David McAlmont and Bernard Butler had already experienced individual success: Butler as the guitarist in Suede, and McAlmont as a solo singer as well as part of the duo Thieves.

The duo was formed after Butler met McAlmont at the Jazz Café in Camden. He presented the singer with the beginnings of the song &quot;Yes&quot;, which was then an instrumental. The single, released in May 1995, was described as &quot;a conceptual masterpiece&quot; and the production likened to that of Phil Spector. In support of &quot;Yes&quot;, the duo appeared at London&#x27;s Hanover Grand in May 1995 (supported by Edwyn Collins) and on &quot;Later... With Jools Holland&quot; the following month. &quot;Yes&quot; reached number 8 in the UK Singles Chart, and its success encouraged the duo to write and record more material.
The follow-up single, &quot;You Do&quot;, was released in October 1995. The same month, McAlmont was interviewed by the &quot;NME&quot; – apparently intoxicated – in which he highlighted how his and Butler&#x27;s working relationship had deteriorated and they had little communication, as well as accusing Butler of homophobia; he later retracted his comments and issued Butler an apology. In November, &quot;The Sound Of... McAlmont &amp; Butler&quot; was released as a compilation of the group&#x27;s recording sessions. 

The duo split following the release of the album; the split has been attributed to either McAlmont&#x27;s &quot;NME&quot; interview or that from the outset the duo planned to have a limited duration.

=== Reformations ===
After pursuing solo careers for several years, the duo reunited in 2002 and released &quot;Bring It Back&quot; and two singles – &quot;Falling&quot; and &quot;Bring It Back&quot;. The group toured in promotion of the album.

Preparations for a third album were made, although negotiations with EMI Records fell through and the label dropped the band. Despite this, the song &quot;Speed&quot; – taken from the album sessions – was released by Rough Trade Records in 2006.

In 2014, Butler organised two special shows as McAlmont &amp; Butler in aid of the Bobath Centre, a cerebral palsy treatment organisation. The performances were held at the Union Chapel and the Assembly Hall, both in Islington. The duo were supported by The Magic Numbers, and the shows received positive reviews; both &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; rating them four stars.

In November 2015, the group headlined a UK tour.

<doc id="1242530" wikidata="Q967861" url="?curid=1242530" title="National Bank of Romania">
<text>The National Bank of Romania (, BNR) is the central bank of Romania and was established in April 1880. Its headquarters are located in the capital city of Bucharest. 

The National Bank of Romania is responsible for the issue of the Romanian leu and as such it sets the monetary policy, holds the currency reserves and manages the exchange rate.

==History==
The bank&#x27;s first governor was Ion Câmpineanu. Eugeniu Carada is associated to the National Bank, as he was the founder of the bank and he was elected director of the bank, but he never accepted the role of Governor. 

In 1916, in the wake of the Central Powers&#x27; invasion, the valuables of the National Bank of Romania, together with many other valuables (the Romanian Treasure) were sent to Moscow for safekeeping, but were never returned (except for the Pietroasele treasure - now on display at the National Museum of Romanian History, the numismatic collection of the National Bank, some paintings and archives).

On 28 July 1959, an armed group of six Jewish Romanian, members of the Romanian Communist Party apparatus (the Ioanid Gang: Alexandru Ioanid, Paul Ioanid, Igor Sevianu, Monica Sevianu, Sașa Mușat and Haralambie Obedeanu) were alleged to have stolen from an armored car of the National Bank of Romania 1,600,000 lei (about 250,000 U.S. dollars at 1959 prices). It was allegedly the most famous bank robbery in the Eastern bloc. Beyond accusations based on various ideological guidelines, no reasons for the alleged robbery, or for the Ioanid group to have perpetrated it, were ever given at the trial. 

Although the persons on trial were accused of intending to donate the money to Zionist organizations that would send Romanian Jews to Israel, the stolen sum was in lei, which at the time could not be exchanged for hard currency anywhere in the world. All these aspects, together with the numerous cases of sentences based on false accusations, have led most persons to doubt that any robbery actually took place or that those charged with the crime committed it.

==Architecture==

===The Old BNR Palace===
The head office of the National Bank of Romania with the view of Lipscani Street is one of the most imposing and massive bank edifices in Romania, nowadays a historic, art monument, and protected as such. It was erected on the former site of the inn built by Șerban Cantacuzino (1678–1688). 
On 26 February 1882, architects Cassien Bernard and Albert Galleron were assigned the task to blueprint the BNR Palace. The construction of the building in the eclectic style of the late 19th century, with some neo-classical elements, proceeded between 12 July 1884 (when the foundation stone was laid) and June 1890 under the direction of the architect engineer Nicolae Cerchez assisted by architect E. Băicoianu.

===The New BNR Palace===
With the façade on Doamnei Street, the new wing of the BNR Palace was built during World War II, after having laid the foundation stone back in 1937. 

The construction works carried on between 1942-44 under the direction of architect Ion Davidescu assisted by two other architects, Radu Dudescu and N. Crețoiu. 

The building is emblematic of the neo-classical style with rationalist influences that prevailed in the interwar period. It impresses by the monumental granite stairs, the huge Corinthian columns forming the façade, and the large, white marble-coated halls inside the building. 

==Responsibilities==
The main tasks of the National Bank of Romania are the following:

* to define and implement the monetary policy and the exchange rate policy;
* to conduct the authorisation, regulation and prudential supervision of credit institutions and to promote and oversee the smooth operation of the payment systems with a view to ensuring financial stability;
* to issue banknotes and coins as legal tender on the territory of Romania;
* to set the exchange rate regime and to supervise its observance;
* to manage the official reserves of Romania.

<doc id="1242544" wikidata="Q2982903" url="?curid=1242544" title="Calgary Zoo">
<text>The Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo is located in Bridgeland, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, just east of the city&#x27;s downtown and adjacent to the Inglewood and East Village neighborhoods. It is accessible via Calgary&#x27;s C-Train light rail system, by car via Memorial Drive, and by bicycle and footpath via the Bow River pathway. A large portion of the zoo is located on St. George&#x27;s Island in the Bow River.

The zoo is operated by the Calgary Zoological Society, an independent not-for-profit organization that is Alberta&#x27;s oldest registered charity. The AZA-, WAZA-, and CAZA-accredited zoo was among the first in Canada to be accredited by all three associations. It is home to over 1,000 animals, excluding individual fish and insects, and 272 different species. The 120-acre zoo is organized by seven distinct zones: Destination Africa, Canadian Wilds, Penguin Plunge, Dorothy Harvie Botanical Gardens and ENMAX Conservatory, TransAlta Rainforest, Eurasia, and Prehistoric Park. The zoo is open every day except for Christmas Day.

The zoo has also received international recognition as one of the top zoos in the world for conservation research. In 2013, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums said &quot;the Calgary Zoo sets itself apart as one of the top zoos in the world.&quot; In 2015 the zoo was named one of the top three most respected organizations in Alberta and one of Alberta&#x27;s 10 most beloved brands.

==History==
St. George&#x27;s Island was Calgary&#x27;s first park, used by the community for picnics, relaxing, and socializing. The first collection of animals appeared on the island in 1917. The Calgary Zoological Society was established on 9 January 1929.

Several animals died during floods in June 1929 when St. George&#x27;s Island was swamped.

Destination Africa opened in 2003 to include two new facilities The TransAlta Rain Forest and the African Savannah. The zoo opened Penguin Plunge, an Arctic/Antarctic penguin addition in 2012.

In April 2013, the Calgary Zoo announced a master plan for rebuilding the zoo over 20 years. The initial focus on the master plan was preparing for the arrival of two giant pandas in 2018 for a five-year stay.

The Calgary Zoo Foundation rebranded itself as the Wilder Institute and instituted the new joint Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo branding in 2021.

===2013 flooding===
The Calgary area suffered extensive flooding in June 2013 resulting in over $50 million in damage to the island section of the Calgary Zoo and parts of its Canadian Wild zone (see 2013 Alberta floods). In a 12-hour period, with flood waters rising, zoo staff managed to move 140 animals to higher ground. In the end, the only animals lost were a number of fish, two peacocks, and a pot-bellied pig. The zoo was closed for most of July 2013; the northern 60 acres of the zoo reopened to the public for August through November. The zoo fully reopened in November 2013 with new animals, exhibits, and features unveiled in 2014, including mandrills and Komodo dragons.

==Destinations==
===Overview===
The Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo has many different exhibits in its 92 acres of land.

===Destination Africa===

Opened in 2003, the Destination Africa project was among the zoo&#x27;s most ambitious expansions. The complex of four buildings includes the &quot;TransAlta Rainforest&quot; and the &quot;African Savannah&quot;. The TransAlta Rainforest occupies 2,900 square metres (31,000 square feet) and features a collection of African rainforest flora and fauna. The African Savannah building is home to hippos, Masai giraffes, red river hogs, and a baobab tree. A 340,000-litre (80,000-gallon) indoor pool for hippos offers view of the creatures underwater.

In the warmer months, the doors lift to connect the building with the rest of the Savannah exhibit, home to Hartmann&#x27;s mountain zebras, grey crowned cranes and ostriches. Many other animals of the grasslands, including African lions, also reside in the Savannah exhibit. In the TransAlta Rainforest, there are primates such as western lowland gorillas, eastern black-and-white colobus, and mandrills, and a number of reptiles including leopard tortoises, Malagasy tree boas, a panther chameleon and a pair of dwarf crocodiles, as well as an aviary containing various species of African birds.

====Land Of Lemurs====
In 2017, the Land of Lemurs was opened to the public, with 3 different species of lemurs residing within; the black-and-white ruffed lemur, the ring-tailed lemur, and the red-fronted lemur.

===Canadian Wilds===

The Canadian Wilds were built in the 1990s to house the majority of zoo&#x27;s collection of North American birds and mammals. The area includes outdoor enclosures in three zones: the &quot;Aspen Woodlands&quot;, the &quot;Northern Forest&quot;, and the &quot;Rocky Mountains&quot;. Animals in the enclosures include dall sheep, river otters, caribou, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, grizzly bears, polar bears, muskoxen, moose, whooping cranes, black bears, cougars, wood bison, and grey wolves.

====Rocky Mountain Bird Aviary====
This aviary includes a barred owl, golden eagle, great grey owl, bald eagle, snowy owl, and rough-legged hawk.

===Dorothy Harvie Botanical Gardens and ENMAX Conservatory===
The outdoor gardens are among the zoo&#x27;s most popular attractions and include the &quot;Dorothy Harvie Gardens&quot;. The zoo&#x27;s sheltered location supports many marginally hardy plant species. The conservatory comprises the indoor component of the zoo&#x27;s gardens. It includes a number of &quot;themed&quot; areas such as the &quot;tropical garden&quot;, the &quot;rainforest&quot;, the &quot;arid garden&quot;, and the &quot;butterfly garden&quot;. A number of animals including birds and invertebrates are housed in the conservatory. The ENMAX Conservatory was completely renovated in 2009 and features an increased emphasis on teaching visitors the importance of plants and improving energy efficiency. The Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo achieved LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold in energy conservation and responsible building practices, the first facility of its kind to achieve this level of certification.

===Exploration Asia (Formerly Eurasia)===

The western portion of St. George&#x27;s Island is dedicated to Eurasian animals. Animals in this area include Amur tigers, snow leopards, Pallas&#x27;s cats, Japanese macaques, red pandas, Japanese serows, Bactrian camels, and Komodo dragons. This section was also home to four giant pandas which debuted in early May 2018. The giant pandas were on loan from the Chengdu Research Base in Chengdu, Sichaun, China. Panda Passage featured adult male Da Mao, cubs Jia Yueyue and Jia Panpan as well as their mother Er Shun. Since then, the pandas have been returned to China because of bamboo supply chain issues arising from CoVID-19. Formerly residing in the Panda&#x27;s habitat area was a herd of Asian elephants (relocated to the Smithsonian National Zoo) and later a male Indian rhinoceros named Sabari (now residing in Safari Niagara, Ontario). The area known as Panda Passage has since been renamed to Gateway to Asia and has seen the addition of a Malayan tapir and 2 white-handed gibbons.

===Prehistoric Park===

The Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo&#x27;s six-acre Prehistoric Park features life-sized dinosaurs in their re-created geographical environment, including replicas of an inland sea and volcanic mountain, and more than 100 species of living plants. Dinosaurs include &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, &quot;Centrosaurus&quot;, &quot;Corythosaurus&quot;, &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot;, &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, &quot;Metriacanthosaurus&quot;, &quot;Nothosaurus&quot;, &quot;Omeisaurus&quot;, &quot;Pachyrhinosaurus&quot;, &quot;Parasaurolophus&quot;, &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, Pterosaur, &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, &quot;Struthiomimus&quot;, &quot;Styracosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;, &quot;Triceratops&quot;, &quot;Tylosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, and &quot;Yangchuanosaurus&quot;.

===Penguin Plunge===
Penguin Plunge and a renovated gift shop were opened in the spring of 2012 and is located at the entrance of the Zoo. The exhibit includes king penguins, Humboldt penguins, gentoo penguins, and rockhopper penguins . Penguin Plunge consists of two main areas, an indoor climate-controlled habitat and an outdoor open-air habitat. In summer, the outdoor exhibit holds the warm-weather South American Humboldt penguins which are housed inside during the winter. On winter days when the temperature is between +5 °C and -25 °C without wind above 20 km/h, the king penguins go on scheduled walks for exercise and enrichment.

===Other/Former Animals===

The zoo contains a flock of Chilean flamingos next to the enclosure containing both a herd of alpacas and greater rheas. Indian peafowl are allowed to venture around openly and freely across the zoo grounds, and are taken to an off-site facility for the winter months.

Prior to the 2013 flooding, the zoo also had an area section dedicated to South American animals such as giant anteaters, red-bellied piranhas and various New World monkeys, as well as a number of birds including several species of macaw and two Andean condors. There also used to be an Australian animal portion, notorious for the Creatures of the Night exhibit, mostly consisting of various nocturnal animals such as bats. Also present were a number of kangaroos, emus, monitor lizards, and for a brief temporary time, koalas.

Kamala the elephant lived at Calgary Zoo from 1976 to 2014. While there, she gave birth to a male named Calvin in 1986 and a female named Maharani in 1990.
==Conservation==

One third of the zoo&#x27;s 130 species are cared for within Species Survival Plans, a global initiative to protect at-risk genetic diversity. Twenty-nine species at the zoo are in danger of extinction. Other species are considered &quot;ambassadors&quot; for endangered species. The Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo uses a team of educators including animal keepers, interpreters, teachers, and volunteers to increase awareness among visitors about the beauty of nature and threats to wildlife. Each year the zoo&#x27;s formal programs connect directly with more than 575,000 adults and children.

The Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo is home to a team of biologists who have earned international recognition as North America&#x27;s leaders in the science of species recovery and reintroduction. The science journal &quot;Nature&quot; rates the Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo as one of the top five zoos in the world for conservation research, alongside New York, San Diego, Frankfurt, and London. In June 2012, the head of the Calgary Zoo&#x27;s Centre for Conservation Research, Dr. Axel Moehrenschlager, was awarded the Canadian Wildlife Federation&#x27;s Roland Michener Conservation Award which recognizes individuals who have shown a commitment to &quot;promote, enhance, and further the conservation of Canada&#x27;s natural resources&quot;. Dr. Moehrenschlager is chair of the Reintroduction Specialist Group within the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the world&#x27;s largest conservation network. He is the first North American to hold this position.

The zoo focused on saving eight highly endangered Western Canada species: whooping crane, Vancouver Island marmot, swift fox, black-footed ferret, black-tailed prairie dog, burrowing owl, northern leopard frog and greater sage grouse. It also works on conservation projects around the world, including:
* Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary, Ghana
* Snow leopards in Central Asia, and
* Gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo

In 2008, the zoo&#x27;s Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary project, a collaboration involving 17 Ghana villages, was awarded the United Nations Equator Prize as one of the world&#x27;s top 25 conservation initiatives. It has become a model for community-based conservation throughout Africa.

==Notable animal births==
In March 2012, Amur tiger Katja gave birth to three Amur tiger cubs at the zoo. The species is so highly endangered (there are an estimated 350 individuals worldwide), the births represented a 1% jump in the global population. In 2014, it became necessary to separate Vasili and Samkha, the two male tiger cubs, now almost full grown, from sister Kira and mom Katja (12 years old). Based on the Species Survival Plan recommendation, which manages genetics for future breeding, they were moved to Assiniboine Park Zoo in Winnipeg. In May 2018 Vasili was moved to Toronto Zoo in Toronto.

In early 2016, a western lowland gorilla infant was born to Kioja. Named Kimani, she was underweight at birth, but quickly recovered. Kimani died in 2022 after a struggle with cancer.

In August 2016 a king penguin chick named Edward hatched, born to mother Grace. The following year another king penguin chick hatched and was named Cleopatra to follow a theme of royal names.

In May 2017 a Przewalski&#x27;s horse foal was born at the Calgary Zoo&#x27;s Wildlife Conservation Centre. While not visible to the public, this is an important addition to the genetic diversity of the endangered wild horse.

In June 2018 a bactrian camel calf was born to Eva. He was later named Gobi.

==Events==
===Zoolights===
Zoolights is a Christmas lights festival held annually at the Zoo. It usually closes around the end of December or the beginning of January. The month-long, animal-themed show features more than one million lights and is the largest seasonal light show in western Canada.

==Incidents==
Following a series of high-profile incidents in 2008 and 2009, some commentators criticized the zoo&#x27;s conduct and operations.

Past incidents cited included:
* In January 2009, a two-year-old male Turkmenian markhor died after becoming entangled in an exhibit&#x27;s play toy.
* In 2009, a knife was accidentally left in the western lowland gorilla enclosure. 
* On 5 December 2009, an 18-month-old female capybara died after being crushed by a hydraulic door. A worker did not follow a long-standing procedure in operating the door.
* In September 2010, Calgary Zoo staff announced the overnight death of a second tiger cub born earlier in the week to a Siberian tiger. Zookeepers were not aware that Katja, the 10-year-old mother, was expecting, saying it is hard to detect pregnancy in tigers. Katja did not nurse her young. Zoo staff noticed her carrying the first kitten in her mouth, which is likely how it died. The zoo&#x27;s veterinary team says both Siberian tiger cubs suffered similar head trauma.
* On 12 November 2024, a two-year-old female gorilla died after being struck by a hydraulic door, after a worker mistakenly activated the wrong door while the gorilla was being separated for individual training.

The zoo&#x27;s director said all the incidents are unrelated. An independent review was solicited by the zoo in December 2009 and was conducted by the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The report, released in 2010, spotlighted systemic problems. In response, the zoo developed a 36-point plan that included improving animal care procedures and collection planning, addressing staffing issues like training and structure, enhancing security systems and safety drills, and upgrading aging zoo infrastructure. Later that year, the zoo hired noted animal welfare specialist, Dr. Jake Veasey, who has since instituted major changes and spearheaded new investment in animal facilities.

Additional incidents and animal deaths also include:

* In October 2011, a zookeeper resigns following the death of a corn snake, as the keeper had left it unattended near a heat source.
* In September 2014, a problem with an ozone sensor in the hippopotamus pool is blamed for the deaths of 85 tilapia.
* In February 2016, an otter drowned after becoming tangled in pants given to it by a zookeeper.
* In December 2016, seven Humboldt penguins died, drowning in a holding pool.
* In May 2023, a Masai Giraffe has died of a broken neck after getting its ossicone caught in a cable around their enclosure.
* In July 2024, one of the zoo’s popular polar bears, Baffin, died by drowning after what zoo officials described as “rough play” with another bear.

<doc id="1242546" wikidata="Q1166248" url="?curid=1242546" title="Darkane">
<text>Darkane is a Swedish metal band that originated in Helsingborg in 1998. Their music contains ample thrash elements interspersed with acoustic interludes and symphonic features, such as the in-studio use of synthesizers and occasionally full orchestras and choir singing. The name &quot;Darkane&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;dark&quot; and &quot;arcane&quot;.

== History ==

=== Formation and &quot;Rusted Angel&quot; (1998–2000) ===
Darkane was formed by former Agretator guitarist Christofer Malmström and drummer Peter Wildoer, who recorded a 2-song demo in 1998. On the strength of these two songs, Darkane landed a record deal with War Music, and the band&#x27;s lineup was completed by bassist Jörgen Löfberg, guitarist Klas Ideberg, and vocalist Bjorn &quot;Speed&quot; Strid. However, as vocalist of the already-established Soilwork, Speed was unable to continue dividing his time, and decided to leave Darkane. After a period of several months without a vocalist, he was replaced by vocalist Lawrence Mackrory, who was recommended by the band&#x27;s producer, Daniel Bergstrand.

Mackrory recorded all vocals on the debut album, &quot;Rusted Angel&quot;, and performed several live dates with the band later that year. However, due to other commitments, Mackrory was unable to tour with the band in early 1999, and was replaced by Andreas Sydow, who had been a member of a cover band with Malmström years earlier.

=== &quot;Insanity&quot; and &quot;Expanding Senses&quot; (2001–2003) ===
After playing many festivals and shows for the next several months, the band signed a new record deal with Nuclear Blast, and returned to the studio to record their second album. These recording sessions would prove challenging, as electrical storms, floods, and equipment malfunctions caused significant issues during the production of the album, which was named &quot;Insanity&quot; as a result.

After more European touring and their first North American show in 2001, the band began work on their third album, &quot;Expanding Senses&quot;, which was released in 2002.

=== &quot;Layers of Lies&quot; (2004–2007) ===
Darkane toured extensively following the release of &quot;Expanding Senses&quot;, and by early 2004 had almost an entire album&#x27;s worth of songs written. However, at that time, drummer Peter Wildoer suffered a wrist injury, and began experiencing severe wrist pain. The band went on hiatus to allow Wildoer to recover. During this hiatus, guitarist Christofer Malmström released a solo album (Non Human Level) which was a compilation of unreleased songs he had written from 1998 to 2004. Guitarist Klas Ideberg spent time working with his side project Terror 2000.

By late 2004, Wildoer&#x27;s injury had healed, and the band reconvened to record their fourth album, &quot;Layers of Lies&quot;, released in May 2005. After more extensive touring, the band started putting together the live compilation DVD &quot;Layers of Live&quot;, however, this effort would take several years, not being released until 2010. On 13 August 2007, vocalist Andreas Sydow decided to end his tenure with Darkane. This led to the arrival of former Construcdead and The Defaced vocalist, Jens Broman on 25 October 2007.

=== &quot;Demonic Art&quot; and switching singers (2008–2011) ===
On 6 October 2007 it was announced that Darkane was writing new material for their fifth studio album &quot;Demonic Art&quot;, which was later released on 24 October 2008. Peter Wildoer posted this message on his website: &quot;&quot;This coming winter we will start recording Darkane&#x27;s fifth record. We have about nine songs ready. We were hoping to enter the studio earlier but in typical Darkane bad luck, our studio got flooded and badly damaged. So now we&#x27;re looking for a new location for the studio and as soon as we find that we need to rebuild the studio which takes a lot of time. Hopefully we will start recording around Christmas (fingers crossed). In some weeks, we&#x27;ll start working on the mix of the upcoming Darkane DVD. I just hope the DVD will be released early next year&quot;.&quot;

Darkane&#x27;s only full-length DVD was shot in May 2006 in the band&#x27;s hometown of Helsingborg, Sweden.

On 6 August 2011 it was announced that vocalist Jens Broman was leaving the band due to personal issues. He was replaced by former Darkane vocalist Lawrence Mackrory, who appeared on the debut album, &quot;Rusted Angel&quot;.

=== &quot;The Sinister Supremacy&quot; (2012–present) ===
On 30 July 2012, it was announced that Darkane was back in the studio recording their sixth studio album, which they plan to release in early 2013. Once released, this will be their first studio album since 2008&#x27;s &quot;Demonic Art&quot; and with Lawrence Mackrory on vocals since 1999&#x27;s &quot;Rusted Angel&quot;.

The album&#x27;s title &quot;The Sinister Supremacy&quot; and release date of 28 June 2013, was announced on 4 April 2013. Regarding the title, the band said: &quot;&quot;The Sinister Supremacy&quot; is a metaphor for the evil that controls us. It&#x27;s the dark part of our minds and it&#x27;s inside us all. It tells us it&#x27;s OK to do bad things, to hurt other people, and hurt ourselves. It guides us into making choices based on pure selfishness, and it thrives on complete chaos.&quot;

The track listing and the album cover, were revealed on 9 May 2013. The album cover was done by Carlos Holmberg (ex-Soilwork) and the cover is a Rorschach test as seen by an individual who has completely succumbed to the sinister supremacy, according to the band.

On June 24, 2022, after 9 years the band released their long-awaited follow-up to 2013&#x27;s The Sinister Supremacy titled Inhuman Spirits.

On May 16, 2024, the band announced that vocalist Lawrence Mackrory had departed the band. Less than a week later, the band announced Tobiasz Derengowski as their new vocalist.

<doc id="1242549" wikidata="Q1065400" url="?curid=1242549" title="Castanopsis">
<text>Castanopsis, commonly called chinquapin or chinkapin, is a genus of evergreen trees belonging to the beech family, Fagaceae. The genus contains about 140 species, which are today restricted to tropical and subtropical eastern Asia. The English name chinkapin is shared with other related plants, including the golden chinkapins of the Pacific northwest, which are sometimes included within &quot;Castanopsis&quot; but are more often considered a separate but very closely related genus, &quot;Chrysolepis&quot;.

== Description ==
They show many characters typical of Fagaceae. They are at least large shrubs but some species grow into sizeable trees. Their leaves are usually tough and much sclerotized and have a well-developed cuticula. Their flowers are unisexual, and the male ones are borne in erect catkins. The epigynous female flowers produce a single seed each but are congregated in small clusters. The fruit is a calybium, the kind of encased nut typical of Fagaceae. The calybium (nut) resembles a pointed acorn; the cupule (casing) is hard like that of beechnuts and spiny like that of chestnuts. Three thickened ridges run the length of the calybium&#x27;s shell.

== Species ==
The genus contains about 140 species.

=== Formerly placed here ===
* &quot;Castanea henryi&quot; (as &quot;C. henryi&quot; )
* &quot;Chrysolepis&quot;

=== Fossil record ===
Fossil species known from Miocene Europe are:
* &quot;Castanopsis pyramidata&quot; 
* &quot;Castanopsis salinarum&quot; 
* &quot;Castanopsis schmidtiana&quot; 

These are known and identifiable from their fruit. It is not entirely clear if they belong here or into &quot;Chrysolepis&quot;, but the pattern of biogeography - with the two genera being most diverse around the Pacific but absent from North America east of the Rocky Mountains suggests that they are indeed correctly assigned to &quot;Castanopsis&quot;. In addition, two form taxa refer to the remains of these trees, at least in part: the fossil wood &quot;Castanoxylon eschweilerense&quot; and the fossil pollen &quot;Tricolporopollenites cingulum&quot; ssp. &quot;pusillus&quot;.

&quot;Castanopsis praefissa&quot; and &quot;Castanopsis praeouonbiensis&quot; are described from fossil specimens collected from the upper Miocene Shengxian Formation, Zhejiang Province, Southeast China. The fossil leaves are obovate to elliptical with serration mostly confined to the upper 1/3 of the leaf. The fossil cupule (upper part of the acorn) is globose with branched spines, and a broadly ovate nut scar. The fossil leaves and cupule have been compared with those extant in this genus. &quot;Castanopsis praefissa&quot; shows the closest affinity to &quot;C. fissa&quot;, and &quot;C. praeouonbiensis&quot; closely resembles &quot;C. ouonbiensis&quot;. &quot;Castanopsis praeouonbiensis&quot; and &quot;C. praefissa&quot; became extinct in this area because of the cooling climate from the late Miocene to the present day in Zhejiang Province.

The oldest known records of the genus are those of &quot;Castanopsis rothwellii&quot; and &quot;Castaneophyllum patagonicum&quot; from the Eocene of Patagonia.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Today the genus is restricted to tropical and subtropical eastern Asia. A total of 58 species are native to China, with 30 endemic; the other species occur further south, through Indochina to Indonesia and the Philippines, mountainous areas of Taiwan, and also in Japan.

== Ecology ==
In their rather circumscribed area of occurrence, &quot;Castanopsis&quot; are able to inhabit a wide range of temperate to tropical habitat and are often keystone species in their ecosystems. They are plentiful in ecotones as diverse as Borneo montane rain forests, Taiwan subtropical evergreen forests and Northern Triangle temperate forests. Generally they are common in Fagales-dominated montane forests and temperate to subtropical laurel forests. In the latter, they are characteristic elements of the climax vegetation in essentially their entire continental Asian range, as well as on Taiwan.

Plants of this genus grow on many soil types, as long as they are not calcareous. Several species have adapted to podsolic, peat bog, swamp and other acidic and/or wet soils, or to the poor dry soils common in arid habitat. Around the Oligo-Miocene boundary, &quot;Castanopsis&quot; grew abundantly along rivers and in bogs and swamps of then-subtropical Europe. The prehistoric plant community &quot;Castanopsietum oligo-miocenicum&quot; is the source of much of the lignite (&quot;brown coal&quot;) deposits in Western and Central Europe.
== Uses ==
Most species yield valuable timber but some have become rare due to unsustainable logging; &quot;C. catappaefolia&quot; is even in danger of extinction. As noted above, however, perhaps the most important use for &quot;Castanopsis&quot; wood is in its fossil form. 175,400 metric tons of lignite – much of which was former chinkapin trees – were mined in Germany in 2001.

As with many Fagaceae, the nuts of many &quot;Castanopsis&quot; species are edible. The trees may be grown for their nuts, but more often they are used as forestry or ornamental trees and the nuts are collected opportunistically. Among many animals, such as tits, corvids, rodents, deer and pigs, the nuts are popular as food too.

== In culture ==
The well-known and commercially important shiitake mushroom grows on the logs of &quot;C. cuspidata&quot; and derives its common name from this: &quot;shii-take&quot; simply means &quot;&quot;Castanopsis cuspidata&quot; mushroom&quot;.

<text>Sakis, or saki monkeys, are any of several New World monkeys of the genus Pithecia. They are closely related to the bearded sakis of genus &quot;Chiropotes&quot;.

==Range==
Sakis&#x27; range includes northern and central South America, extending from the south of Colombia, over Peru, in northern Bolivia, and into the central part of Brazil.

==Body functionality==
Sakis are small-sized monkeys with long, bushy tails. Their furry, rough skin is black, grey or reddish-brown in color depending upon the species. The faces of some species are naked, but their head is hooded with fur. Their bodies are adapted to life in the trees, with strong hind legs allowing them to make far jumps. Sakis reach a length of 30 to 50 cm, with a tail just as long, and weigh up to 2 kg.

==Habitat and habit==
Sakis are diurnal animals. They live in the trees of the rain forests and only occasionally go onto the land. They mostly move on all fours, sometimes running in an upright position on the hind legs over the branches, and sometimes jumping long distances. For sleeping they roll themselves cat-like in the branches. They are generally very shy, cautious animals. Sakis allow adult offspring and non-related immigrants into their groups unlike titi or owl monkeys. Saki monkeys have been commonly considered to be socially monogamous, but generally only sakis who are pair-living exhibit social monogamy. Females primarily carry infants and male-infant interactions are rare.

==Diet==
Sakis are frugivores. Their diet consists of over 90% fruit and is supplemented by a small proportion of leaves, flowers, and insects. Sakis, as well as uakaris, engage in a specialized form of frugivory in which they focus specifically on unripe fruits and seeds.

==Procreation==
Mating is non-seasonal, and can happen any time during the year. After approximately 150- to 180-day gestation, females bear single young. The young are weaned after 4 months, and are fully mature in 3 years. Their life expectancy is up to 30 years.

<text>The Source at White Plains is a large urban-style shopping complex in downtown White Plains, New York, owned and managed by &#x27;New England Development&#x27;. The Source is located next to The Westchester and Crowne Plaza hotel, and features several major brand-name retailers and restaurants including Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods, Raymour &amp; Flanigan, The Cheesecake Factory, and Whole Foods Market.

The Source opened in 2004 and was built on the site of one of the first suburban branches of Saks Fifth Avenue, which closed in early 2002. The mall is connected to a large 4-story parking garage. Within close proximity of The Source are complementary retail developments such as The Westchester mall (featuring anchor stores Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom), a freestanding Bloomingdale&#x27;s department store, the City Center at White Plains, and the Galleria at White Plains mall.

As of December 2015, the management contract for The Source at White Plains was awarded to The Wilder Companies, based out of Boston and managed by John Tacij.

Danone International has established their headquarters at The Source, moving from their previous North White Plains location. Danone took over space on the top floor of the center, which had been vacant since the closure of the three-level Fortunoff store.

<text>Contact image sensors (CIS) are image sensors used in flatbed scanners almost in direct contact with the object to be scanned. Charge-coupled devices (CCDs), the other kind of sensor often used in scanners, use mirrors to bounce light to a stationary sensor. Scanners using CISs are much smaller than ones that use CCDs, use typically a tenth as much power, and are particularly suitable for low power and portable applications, often powered over USB.
A CIS typically consists of a linear array of detectors, covered by focusing lenses and flanked by red, green, and blue LEDs for illumination. The use of LEDs allows the CIS to be highly power efficient, allowing scanners to be powered through the minimal line voltage supplied via a USB connection. CIS devices typically produce lower image quality compared to CCD devices; in particular, the depth of field is greatly limited, which poses a problem for material that is not perfectly flat. However, a CIS contact sensor is smaller and lighter than a CCD line sensor, and allows all the necessary optical elements to be included in a compact module, thus helping to simplify the inner structure of the scanner. With a CIS contact sensor, the scanner can be portable, with a height of only around 30 mm.
CIS is a key component widely used in scanners (especially portable scanners), electrographs, bar code readers and optical identification technology.

<text>Rhapsody: A Dream Novel, also known as Dream Story (), is a 1926 novella by the Austrian writer Arthur Schnitzler. The book deals with the thoughts and psychological transformations of Doctor Fridolin over a two-day period after his wife confesses having had sexual fantasies involving another man. In this short time, he meets many people who give clues to the world Schnitzler creates. This culminates in the masquerade ball, an event of masked identity, sex, and danger for Doctor Fridolin, the outsider.

It was first published in installments in the magazine &quot;Die Dame&quot; between December 1925 and March 1926. The first book edition appeared in 1926 in S. Fischer Verlag. The best known of the film adaptations is the 1999 film &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; by director-screenwriter Stanley Kubrick and co-screenwriter Frederic Raphael, although it makes significant alterations to the setting. Prior to this film, it had been adapted for Austrian television in 1969, as an Italian film entitled &quot;Il cavaliere, la morte e il diavolo&quot; in 1983, and as a low-budget Italian film entitled &quot;Nightmare in Venice&quot; in 1989.

The book belongs to the period of the Decadent movement in Vienna after the turn of the 20th century.

== Story ==
&quot;Dream Story&quot; is set in early-20th-century Vienna during Mardi Gras. The protagonist of the story is Fridolin, a successful 35-year-old doctor who lives with his wife, Albertina (also translated as Albertine), and their young daughter.

One night, Albertina confesses that the previous summer, while they were on vacation in Denmark, she had a sexual fantasy about a young Danish military officer. Fridolin then admits that during that same vacation, he had been attracted to a young girl on the beach. Later that night, Fridolin is called to the deathbed of an important patient. Finding the man dead, he is shocked when the man&#x27;s daughter, Marianne, professes her love to him. Restless, Fridolin leaves and begins to walk the streets. Although tempted, he refuses the offer of a young prostitute named Mizzi.

He encounters his old friend Nachtigall, who tells Fridolin that he will be playing piano at a secret high-society orgy that night. Intrigued, Fridolin procures a mask and costume and follows Nachtigall to the party at a private residence. Fridolin is shocked to find several men in masks and costumes, along with naked women wearing only masks, engaged in various sexual activities. When a young woman warns him to leave, Fridolin ignores her plea and is soon exposed as an interloper. The woman then announces to the gathering that she will sacrifice herself for Fridolin, and he is allowed to leave.

Upon his return home, Albertina awakens and describes a dream she has had: while making love to the Danish officer from her sexual fantasies, she had watched without sympathy as Fridolin was tortured and crucified before her eyes. Fridolin is outraged because he believes that this proves his wife wants to betray him. He resolves to pursue his own sexual temptations.

The next day, Fridolin learns that Nachtigall has been taken away by two mysterious men. He then goes to the costume shop to return his costume and discovers that the shop owner is prostituting his teenage daughter to various men. He finds his way back to where the orgy had taken place the previous night; before he can enter, he is handed a note addressed to him by name that warns him not to pursue the matter. Later, he visits Marianne, but she no longer expresses any interest in him. Fridolin searches for Mizzi, the prostitute, but is unable to find her. He reads that a young woman has been poisoned. Suspecting that she is the woman who sacrificed herself for him, he views the woman&#x27;s corpse in the morgue but cannot identify her.

Fridolin returns home that night to find Albertina asleep, with his mask from the previous night set on the pillow on his side of the bed. When she wakes up, Fridolin confesses all of his activities. After listening quietly, Albertina comforts him. Fridolin says that it never will happen again, but Albertina tells him not to look too far into the future, and that the important thing is that they survived their adventures.

The story ends with them greeting the new day with their daughter.

<text>The Government Hill is a hill in Central, Hong Kong, bounded by upper section of Upper Albert Road on the south, Queen&#x27;s Road Central north, Garden Road east, and Glenealy, west of Hong Kong Island.

The hill has been the administrative centre of Hong Kong since the early days of British colonial rule, and has remained so after the transfer of sovereignty. The Government House, residence of chief executive and colonial governor, and the Former Central Government Offices (Government Headquarters), occupied large portion of the hill.

St. John&#x27;s Cathedral of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui, the Anglican Church in Hong Kong, is also on the Government Hill. Adjacent to it is the Court of Final Appeal, inside the Former French Mission Building, with Battery Path leading to Queen&#x27;s Road Central.

Beside the already crowded central business district, the hill is free from skyscrapers and preserved many century-old trees. Higher up the hill in the south is Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens.

In 2011, an application was made to the Town Planning Board to rezone the area as a Historic site, and cap the building heights to the height of the existing buildings.

<doc id="1242573" wikidata="Q906130" url="?curid=1242573" title="Sunset Limited">
<text>The Sunset Limited is a long-distance passenger train run by Amtrak, operating on a route between New Orleans and Los Angeles. Major stops include Houston, San Antonio and El Paso in Texas, as well as Tucson, Arizona. Opening in 1894 through the Southern Pacific Railroad, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; is the oldest continuously operating named train in the United States.

With three round-trip journeys per week, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; is tied with the &quot;Cardinal&quot; for the lowest frequency of any regularly-scheduled Amtrak route. Each end-to-end journey takes about two days. West of San Antonio, the train runs combined with the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot;.

From 1993–2005, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; operated an extended service to Miami, Florida, becoming Amtrak&#x27;s longest and only coast-to-coast train route. Major stops between New Orleans and Miami included Mobile (Alabama), Jacksonville, Orlando, and Hialeah (Florida). However, the route east of New Orleans was permanently halted in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

==History==

===Southern Pacific===
Before the start of Amtrak on May1, 1971, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; was operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad. The &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; is the oldest named train in the United States, operating since November 1894 along the Sunset Route (though originally named the &quot;Sunset Express&quot;). The Sunset Route (originating in New Orleans) is the southernmost of the three gateways to the West Coast envisioned through the Pacific Railroad Acts. The other two embarked from Chicago and St. Louis. However, the Sunset Route had two major advantages over the other two routes. It was an all-weather, year-round route that did not face the crippling snows of the Wasatch or Sierra mountain ranges to reach the Pacific Coast. Additionally, the other two routes had to assault the front range of the Rockies.

In addition, opened 20 years before the Panama Canal, the Sunset Route vastly shortened the time to reach the West Coast from the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, as New Orleans was already an established seaport for Atlantic shipping lines’ passengers, seeking to reach the US interior. The Sunset Limited allowed passengers to reach the West Coast in a few days, not weeks.

The &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; was Southern Pacific&#x27;s premier train. Initially, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; was an all-Pullman train, with sleeping cars and no coaches, running from New Orleans to San Francisco via Los Angeles. From its beginning in 1894, until streamlining in 1950, all the train&#x27;s cars had 6-wheel trucks and dark olive green paint, with black roofs and trucks. In the summer of 1926, it was scheduled at 71 hr 40 min New Orleans to San Francisco; it then carried a coast-to-coast sleeper from Jacksonville to Los Angeles.

The San Francisco–Los Angeles portion of the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; was cut on January 5, 1942. The cut was intended to last only several months to allow for equipment overhaul, but became permanent. On June 2, 1949, the Southern Pacific introduced faster schedules on several named trains. The &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; was reduced to hours eastbound and 48 hours westbound.

In contrast to its earliest Amtrak years, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;, up to its later years, made stops not only at Phoenix, but also at Mesa and Chandler, Arizona.

===Amtrak===
Amtrak assumed operation of most intercity passenger train routes in the United States on May1, 1971, including those of the Southern Pacific. Amtrak retained the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; and initially left its route unchanged.

On October2, 1981, Amtrak began operating the Chicago-bound &quot;Eagle&quot; (known as the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; since 1988) in conjunction with the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;. The routes operate as one train between Los Angeles and San Antonio, Texas.

====Extension to Florida====
The Louisville and Nashville Railroad had operated the &quot;Gulf Wind&quot; between New Orleans and Jacksonville, Florida, from 1949 to 1971, when Amtrak dropped the route. This corridor saw limited service over the next two decades: in 1984–1985 the &quot;Gulf Coast Limited&quot; ran between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama, and from 1989 to 1995 the &quot;Gulf Breeze&quot; served the segment from Mobile to Atmore, Alabama.

On April4, 1993, Amtrak extended the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; eastward to Miami. The train followed the former route of the &quot;Gulf Wind&quot; between New Orleans and Jacksonville, restoring service on that corridor, and used the route of Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; south of Jacksonville. It was serviced at Amtrak&#x27;s Hialeah yards for the return trip. It was only the second direct rail link between Orlando and Miami, following local trains by the Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Coast Line in the mid-1960s.

Schedule unreliability caused the &quot;Sunset Limited&#x27;s&quot; eastern terminus to be truncated to Sanford on November10, 1996. Service was re-extended to Orlando on October26, 1997, and the train deadheaded (operated empty) between Orlando and Sanford for servicing. Sanford was, and still is, the servicing point for Amtrak&#x27;s Auto Train.

====1990s accidents====

On September22, 1993, the three locomotives and four of the eight cars of the eastbound &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; derailed and fell off a damaged bridge into water near Mobile, Alabama. Known as the Big Bayou Canot rail accident, the incident is Amtrak&#x27;s worst train wreck and resulted in 47 deaths.

On October9, 1995, in an event known as the Palo Verde derailment, saboteurs derailed the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; near Harqua, Arizona, by removing 29 spikes from a section of track, and short-circuited the signal system to conceal the sabotage. The attack killed one person and injured dozens of others. The crime still remains unsolved.

====Bypassing of Phoenix====
On June2, 1996, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; was rerouted to a more southerly route between Tucson, and Yuma, Arizona, bypassing Phoenix. Union Pacific, which had acquired Southern Pacific earlier in the year, wanted to abandon a decaying portion of its Phoenix–Yuma &quot;West Line&quot;, particularly the Roll Industrial Lead, that had previously been used to serve Phoenix due to deteriorating track conditions and very light freight traffic. By then the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; was almost the only train using the Wellton Branch, and service was slow and bumpy along this worn-out section. UP demanded that Amtrak pay for the maintenance, which they would not do. Thus by June 1996, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; was bypassing Phoenix, and UP promptly put the 64-mile midsection of the Wellton Cutoff out of service. This made Phoenix one of the nation&#x27;s largest cities without direct passenger service; although the designated Phoenix-area stop is in Maricopa, a suburban community about south of downtown Phoenix. Amtrak Thruway service, run by Stagecoach Express, connects the two cities.

====Hurricane Katrina====
On August29, 2005, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; route was truncated east of San Antonio, Texas, as a result of damage to trackage in the Gulf Coast area caused by Hurricane Katrina. In late October 2005, service was restored between San Antonio and New Orleans, as the line through Louisiana had been repaired. Service east of New Orleans was suspended permanently despite CSX Transportation completing repair of the track in January 2006.

====Recent years====
The &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; received a modified schedule on May7, 2012, moving its westbound movements from New Orleans to a Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday circuit. The times allow several 7- to 12-hour rides between major-city pairs; for example, overnight between Tucson or Maricopa (for Phoenix) and Los Angeles in both directions.

While most Amtrak trains saw service reductions in 2020–2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; and its existing sub-daily schedule were not affected. The &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; was reduced to tri-weekly from October 2020 and May 2021, temporarily matching the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;.

On July 11, 2023, the Surface Transportation Board announced that it was opening an investigation into the poor on-time performance of the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;.

==Proposed expansion==

===Re-extension to Florida=== 

As time has passed, particularly since the January 2006 completion of the rebuilding of damaged tracks east of New Orleans by their owner CSX Transportation, the obstacles to restoration of the &quot;Sunset Limited&#x27;s&quot; full route have been more managerial and political than physical. Advocates for the train&#x27;s restoration have pointed to revenue figures for Amtrak&#x27;s fiscal year 2004, the last full year of coast-to-coast &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; service. During that period, the Orlando–New Orleans segment accounted for 41% of the &quot;Sunset&#x27;s&quot; revenue.

Section 226 of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, signed into law by President George W. Bush on October16, 2008, gave Amtrak nine months to provide Congress with a plan for restoring service that &quot;shall include a projected timeline for restoring such service, the costs associated with restoring such service, and any proposals for legislation necessary to support such restoration of service.&quot;

In January 2016, Amtrak and the Southern Rail Commission announced jointly that a Gulf Coast passenger rail inspection trip was to be made from New Orleans to Jacksonville, with elected officials among those on board during the February 18–19 excursion. Stops were planned for all of the stations formerly part of the &quot;Sunset Limited&#x27;s&quot; route between those two cities. In June 2018, the commission missed the deadline for submitting a request for service restoration along the Gulf. It said that it could not apply for the Federal Railroad Administration&#x27;s (FRA) fiscal-year 2017 Consolidated Rail Infrastructure Safety and Improvements (CRISI) funding because Alabama and Mississippi were unwilling to assist with funds. Alabama&#x27;s share would have been $5.3million. The Louisiana governor, on the other hand, was willing to provide the funds. The three states&#x27; cooperation was needed to secure the $35.5million in federal CRISI funds.

====New Gulf Coast service====
On February 23, 2021, following the conclusion of one year of negotiations with CSX and Norfolk Southern, Amtrak officials announced that a new Gulf Coast corridor service between New Orleans and Mobile would start as early as January 2022. Amtrak plans to pay for repairs along the route. In late 2022, with lengthy negotiations with Amtrak, Norfolk Southern, and CSX expected, the Gulf Coast service was projected to begin sometime in 2023. However, in early August 2023, it was reported that an agreement between Amtrak, CSX, and the city of Mobile on the design and construction of the station there had not yet been reached, and that the service was now not expected to start until the first quarter of 2024. In late August the working name of the train was reported to be &quot;Mardi Gras Service&quot;. As of January 2025, Amtrak is planning to have service operational in June 2025.

====Restoration of the Florida Panhandle Service====
In terms of the rest of the route for the restoration of Florida Panhandle service, Amtrak stated that their &quot;focus has been on restoring service from New Orleans to Mobile, Alabama,&quot; and they would be &quot;willing to explore such service [on the Florida Panhandle] with the state’s financial support.&quot; Meanwhile, the Florida Department of Transportation stated that they would support service restoration &quot;as long as the restored service is a National Network long-distance train that will not require a future annual operating subsidy from state sponsors.&quot; The mayors and city councils of Pensacola, Tallahassee, and Lake City have shown much interest in resuming the service. The corridor would eventually need to be upgraded for speeds greater than , and some of the stations require refurbishment or replacement.

===Daily service===
In 2009, Brian Rosenwald, a now-departed Amtrak executive, outlined ideas for a complete overhaul of the route, including daily service. It was to have the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; operate over the &quot;Sunset Limited&#x27;s&quot; route west of San Antonio, with a stub train connecting San Antonio (with a cross-platform transfer) and New Orleans. The plans were halted when Union Pacific stated that to get a daily &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;, Amtrak would need to pay $750million for infrastructure improvements.

Passenger totals would double with daily service, according to the PRIIA study that looked at &quot;Texas Eagle&quot;/&quot;Sunset Limited&quot; service. It forecast an incremental improvement of more than 100,000 passengers from the daily service, which is already running in excess of 100,000 a year. In the meantime, the Union Pacific has double-tracked much of the route with its own money. However, Amtrak still lacks the equipment and funds needed to move to daily service.

In June 2021, Senator Jon Tester of Montana added an amendment to the Surface Transportation Investment Act of 2021 which would require the U.S. Department of Transportation (not Amtrak itself) to evaluate daily service on all less frequent long-distance trains, meaning the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; and &quot;Cardinal&quot;. The bill passed the Senate Commerce Committee with bipartisan support, and was later rolled into President Biden&#x27;s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which Congress passed on November5, 2021. The report is known as the Amtrak Daily Long-Distance Service Study and must be delivered to Congress within two years.

In June 2023, Amtrak submitted an application for a federal grant to increase &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; service to operate daily.

===Return to Phoenix===

Since its Wellton branch closure, officials have intermittently considered different options for how to reopen the line and restore Sunset Limited direct passenger service to Phoenix and potentially launching intercity service to LA. In 2009, the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) requested federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds to help restore the Wellton Branch and bring the Sunset Limited back to Phoenix but was unsuccessful. In 2014, ADOT hired the consultants URS to do a more in-depth Wellton Branch rehabilitation study. The study was commissioned by ADOT in an effort to understand the existing condition of the Wellton Branch and to develop improvement scenarios and capital cost estimates for freight and passenger rail service between Arlington and Wellton, a distance of 90.8 miles. In that study, it was determined that light freight demand along the Wellton Branch line/Phoenix Subdivision does not warrant re-opening the Wellton Branch and that re-opening this corridor solely for passenger service is not cost effective, although if freight demand increased, phased rehabilitation made sense. It also recommended that the State seek to identify and develop freight opportunities for the Wellton Branch.

Ideally, to get the line running again, Amtrak and the ADOT should work with UP to come up with a detailed capital improvement plan. Such a plan would determine exactly what projects are needed and what will they cost. The capital project plan could present an opportunity to propose rebuilding curves (with increased superelevation) and other improvements to increase train speeds. Straight sections could be feasibly improved for trains traveling faster than 100 mph.

New higher Class 5 speed track than the FRA Class 4 track proposed by ‘Scenario 3’ in the 2014 ADOT study is possible. There is no technical reason to limit the Wellton Branch to Class 4. A staged plan for double-tracking the line is also needed, starting with upgrades to existing sidings. If UP needs to continue storing more railcars in the area, then additional sidings can be built for that purpose.

In February 2023, the FRA indicated that it was studying a re-route of the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; from Maricopa back to Phoenix as part of the Amtrak Daily Long-Distance Service Study ordered by the IIJA. The move would revert a 1996 route change that cut direct service to Arizona&#x27;s most populous metropolitan area, with stops at , , and .

In June 2023, Amtrak submitted an application to the FRA seeking funding for a project to return &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; service to Phoenix, paired with increasing the route&#x27;s frequency to once-daily service.

In December 2023, as a part of the Corridor Identification and Development Program, the Federal Government awarded a $500,000 grant to the State of Arizona to study Phoenix–Tucson passenger rail. The new rail line plan would send trains from Tucson to the far East Valley, through downtown and on to the West Valley, before reconnecting to UP&#x27;s mainline in Wellton, near Yuma. Part of this route would include trackage needed for the &quot;Sunset Limited&#x27;s&quot; return to Phoenix service.

== Operation ==
, a typical &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; train has one or two GE P42DC locomotives, a Viewliner II baggage car, a Superliner sleeper, a Superliner diner, a Superliner Sightseer Lounge, a Superliner coach, and a Superliner coach/baggage car. West of San Antonio, the train has an additional sleeper and coach that operate as Los Angeles–Chicago through cars via the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot;. Amtrak plans to eventually re-add a Superliner transition sleeper to the train.

As with other long-distance routes, Amtrak plans to replace the P42DCs with Siemens ALC-42 locomotives by 2027, and the Superliner cars with new long-distance cars by 2032.

===Route===
For most of its existence, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; route was owned by the Southern Pacific Railroad. The name &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; traces its origins to the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway, a Southern Pacific subsidiary which was known as the &quot;Sunset Route&quot; as early as 1874.

Most of the current route from New Orleans westward is now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad, which acquired Southern Pacific in 1996. However, the route within Louisiana and some of Texas was partially sold to BNSF Railway in 1995 in return for BNSF not objecting to the UP-SP merger.

On the portion of the route east of New Orleans, service was suspended after Hurricane Katrina. Those tracks, between New Orleans and Florida, include parts of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad—all now merged into CSX Transportation. Currently, the segment of the former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad between DeLand and Orlando is owned by Orlando&#x27;s commuter service SunRail, and the segment of track from Pensacola to Baldwin is now owned by the Florida Gulf &amp; Atlantic Railroad.

The train uses the following route segments, identified here by the names of their original owners:

===Stations and Connections===


==Ridership==

Along with the &quot;Cardinal&quot;, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; is one of Amtrak&#x27;s two long-distance services which operate thrice weekly. Consequently, it carried the third-fewest passengers of any Amtrak train in fiscal year 2019 (92,827, a 4.4% decrease over FY2018). It had a total revenue of $10,769,179 in 2016, marking a 7.5% decrease over FY2015.

<text>Lainie Kazan (born Lainie Levine; May 15, 1940) is an American actress and singer. She was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; and the 1993 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for her role in &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; (1982). Kazan played Maria Portokalos in the &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; franchise. She also played Aunt Freida on &quot;The Nanny&quot;.

==Early life==
Kazan was born Lainie Levine in Brooklyn, the daughter of Carole (&quot;née&quot; Kazan) and Ben Levine. She is of Ashkenazi Jewish and Sephardic Jewish descent with Russian and Turkish roots. Some of her grandparents lived in Jerusalem before moving to Manchester, England, and settling in Brooklyn. Kazan has described her mother as &quot;neurotic, fragile and artistic.&quot; Kazan attended Brooklyn&#x27;s Erasmus Hall High School with Barbra Streisand, for whom she would later understudy. She graduated in 1956. Kazan studied theatre at HB Studio and graduated from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, in 1960. While at Hofstra, Kazan appeared in school musicals written and directed by a classmate director Francis Ford Coppola as well as actor James Caan.

==Career==
Kazan made her Broadway debut in 1961 with the musical &quot;The Happiest Girl in the World.&quot; She appeared the following year in another musical, &quot;Bravo Giovanni,&quot; and understudied Barbra Streisand for the lead role of Fanny Brice in &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1964). When Streisand could not perform due to a throat condition, Kazan took her place in a matinee and evening performance for one day of the show&#x27;s run. Her popularity increasing, Kazan posed nude for the October 1970 issue of &quot;Playboy,&quot; which was reused in &quot;Pocket Playboy&quot; #4, issued in 1974. Her appearance in the magazine opened the door for her to headline and operate two different Playboy Jazz Clubs. Overseen by Hugh Hefner, the clubs were named Lainie&#x27;s Room West and Lainie&#x27;s Room East, each on opposite coasts, with the first one located in Los Angeles and the other in Manhattan. Her &quot;Playboy&quot; photographs inspired the look of Jack Kirby’s superheroine Big Barda.

Along with appearing in numerous supper clubs across the country, Kazan guest-starred on Dean Martin’s variety series 26 times. Other television work includes a recurring role as Aunt Frieda on the Fran Drescher sitcom &quot;The Nanny,&quot; the mother of Kirstie Alley&#x27;s character on &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Closet,&quot; and various guest roles, including one on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; that resulted in an Emmy nomination. Her other television work has included &quot;The Paper Chase,&quot; &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel,&quot; and &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;.

Kazan played Maria Portokalos, the mother of Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos) in the &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; franchise. Following the first film in the franchise, Kazan was featured in &quot;My Big Fat Greek Life,&quot; a short-lived series based on the film series. Other recent film work includes the mother of Adam Sandler’s character in &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.&quot; Although the scene was deleted in the feature film, it is included on the DVD in the special features section. Kazan appeared as singer Ava St. Clair with Kevin James in two episodes of &quot;The King of Queens&quot;.

A life member of The Actors Studio, Kazan returned to Broadway to recreate her film role for the musical adaptation of &quot;My Favorite Year,&quot; earning a Tony Award nomination for her performance. She completed a stint in &quot;The Vagina Monologues.&quot; She has appeared in regional productions of &quot;A Little Night Music,&quot; &quot;Man of La Mancha,&quot; &quot;,&quot; &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,&quot; &quot;Hello, Dolly!,&quot; and &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. In 1984, she made a guest appearance on the &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; episode “Pinocchio” as Sophia the Blue Fairy.

In the &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; episode &quot;Fire and Nice,&quot; Kazan played Dina Talercio, the mother of Bobby (Adam Rodriguez), who becomes the character&#x27;s brother-in-law. In 2010, Kazan joined the cast of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; for season 7. She played the role of Mrs. Maxine Rosen, a self-employed business owner and neighbor to Susan Delfino.

==Personal life==
After meeting musical director-arranger Peter H.B. Daniels on the Broadway musical &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, in which Kazan was a cast member and he was associate orchestra conductor, the two began a five-year relationship. They married sometime after the 1971 birth of their daughter Jennifer. The marriage did not endure, and Kazan was single again by 1976.

In the 1970s, Kazan was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Since then, she has dedicated time to public education about DVT. 

Beginning in 2012, Kazan became an adjunct professor at UCLA, teaching acting classes and directing her students in drama-department productions. She has served on the boards of the Young Musicians’ Foundation, AIDS Project LA, the B&#x27;nai Brith, the California Jazz Foundation, and her alma mater, Hofstra University.

On April 9, 2016, Kazan was injured in a head-on traffic collision. Kazan was driving her car when the collision occurred in Sherman Oaks, California, which necessitated hospitalization.

In December 2017, outside a California supermarket, Kazan was arrested for shoplifting. Prosecutors reached a plea deal with her.

<text>Hong Kong City Hall (HKCH, ) is a building located at Edinburgh Place, Central, Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong. 

In the 19th century, the British founded City of Victoria in the present-day Central after the establishment of the Crown Colony of Hong Kong. The Crown Colony (including City of Victoria) was governed by a Governor and Urban Council, there was no mayor or city council, therefore, the City Hall does not hold the offices of a city government, unlike most city halls around the world. Instead, it is a complex providing municipal services, including performing venues and libraries. 

The City Hall is managed by the Government&#x27;s Leisure and Cultural Services Department. The Urban Council (UrbCo) managed the City Hall (through the Urban Services Department) and held its meetings there prior to its dissolution in December 1999. Prior to its dissolution the UrbCo served as the municipal council for Hong Kong Island and Kowloon (including New Kowloon). The UrbCo had its meeting chamber in the Low Block of the City Hall.
==First generation==

Hong Kong&#x27;s first City Hall, which existed from 1869 to 1933, occupied the current sites of the HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building (partly) and the Bank of China Building. 
It was designed by the French architect Achille-Antoine Hermitte and was opened by Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, in a ceremony on 28 June 1869.
The current site of the HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building was occupied in part by the old City Hall, and in part by the first and second generations of the HSBC building.

==Second generation==

The second and current City Hall complex was built in the late 1950s following a public campaign led by the Sino-British Club for the re-establishment of a civic centre in Hong Kong. It was built on a plot of land on the newly reclaimed seafront, about from the first generation building.

The foundation stone laying ceremony took place on 25 February 1960 with Sir Robert Brown Black, then Governor of Hong Kong, who also presided over the official opening ceremony on 2 March 1962. The City Hall was placed under the responsibility of the Urban Council. 

Since 2009, it had been listed as a Grade I historic building. On 20 May 2022, the Hong Kong City Hall was declared a monument under the Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance. At the age of 60, it is the youngest as well as the first post-WW2 building in Hong Kong being declared as a monument.

===Design===

The building complex erected at the present site based on the original design by Professor Gordon Brown, the first Head of Department of Architecture of Hong Kong University, together with his team including Patricia O&#x27;Reilly Mayne, was completed by British architects Ronald Phillips and Alan Fitch at the cost of HK$20 million. With its clean lines and stark geometric forms, the new Hall is an example of the International style fashionable at the time. The structure was constructed using steel and concrete, and much of the equipment was of steel, glass and anodised aluminium. 

The two separate blocks and gardens were laid out as a cohesive whole, along a central axis. The entrance to the lower block (exhibition hall) of the City Hall formed an axis with Queen&#x27;s Pier to lend a sense of occasion to visiting dignitaries. On the façade of the Lower Block once had the old Coat of Arms of Hong Kong, which was removed before the handover in 1997. One major consideration was juxtaposing the city bustle whilst maximising public access to the surrounding area. Thus, the out-sized public areas of the &quot;Memorial Gardens&quot; and the piazza in front were conceived as a natural extension to promote the &quot;freedom of movement and a sense of unlimited space&quot;.

===Function===
The most important civic function performed by City Hall was as a ceremonial location for the swearing in of successive Governors following their inauguration: The 24th to 28th Governors all swore their oaths of office there.

City Hall&#x27;s Concert hall and theatre have been an important home to the performing arts in Hong Kong since its inauguration. A number of culture events, including the Hong Kong Festival, Hong Kong Arts Festival in 1973, Asian Arts Festival in 1976, the Hong Kong International Film Festival in 1977, and the International Arts Carnival in 1982 were hosted there. The conference room of the former Urban Council was also at the lower building of the City Hall.

The High block once housed Hong Kong&#x27;s principal public library, until a new Central library was opened in 2001; the Hong Kong art gallery (which became the Hong Kong Art Museum in 1969) began life there on the tenth and eleventh floors. The Hong Kong Museum of History relocated in 1975, and the Hong Kong Museum of Art also moved out of City Hall in 1991.

The &quot;City Hall Memorial Garden&quot;, located at the north-western quadrant between the High Block and Low Block, is a walled garden wherein a 12-sided dodecagon Memorial Shrine commemorates soldiers and citizens who died in defence of Hong Kong during the Second World War. It is a popular spot and obligatory backdrop for photographs of couples who celebrate their marriage in the City Hall Registry. Within the Memorial Shrine are embedded memorial Roll of Honour and Plaques to combat units who fought in Hong Kong during World War II (1941–1945). Inscribed on the walls of the Memorial Shrine are eight chinese characters evoking the everlasting spirit of the Brave and the Dead. The entrance gates to the City Hall Memorial Garden bear the regimental emblems of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps and Royal Hong Kong Regiment.

The complex also incorporates a three-storey car park, with 171 car park spaces, which was also designed by architects Ron Phillips and Alan Fitch.

<text>Terence Paul Nutkins (12 August 1946 – 6 September 2012) was an English naturalist. He appeared in the UK children&#x27;s programmes &quot;Animal Magic&quot;, &quot;The Really Wild Show&quot;, &quot;Brilliant Creatures&quot; and &quot;Growing Up Wild&quot;.

==Biography==
Nutkins was born in 1946 in Marylebone, London, and spent most of his childhood there. His parents&#x27; house overlooked Marylebone station. He skipped school to spend time with the elephants at London Zoo. At the age of 12, Nutkins went to work in the West Highlands of Scotland, the naturalist Gavin Maxwell having written to London Zoo requesting help from two young assistants to look after otters that he was keeping as pets and studying at his remote home at Sandaig near Glenelg. Nutkins was initially hired for a summer placement, but did not return home and with the permission of his parents he spent several years working and living with Maxwell. Maxwell became Nutkins&#x27; legal guardian, and in a Radio 4 documentary Nutkins described living with Maxwell as a &quot;peculiar existence, in virtual isolation, with a man who was as charming as he was difficult, and whose depression led to severe mood swings&quot;. Maxwell wrote several books during Nutkins&#x27; time there, including the hugely successful &quot;Ring of Bright Water&quot; in 1960.

At the age of 15, Nutkins lost part of two fingers to one of the otters, named Edal. In the &quot;United Kingdom&quot; episode of the BBC&#x27;s programme &quot;Deadly 60&quot;, Nutkins stated that the otter became aggressive in response to the scent on a jumper that he had been given by a woman that Edal had already attacked and bitten. Edal tore at Nutkins&#x27; boot, then attacked his right hand as he reached down, severing the end of his middle finger. As he attempted to control the otter with his other hand, the otter bit his other middle finger and twisted away, severing the end of the other finger.

Nutkins revisited the site of the cottage he shared with Maxwell on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Countryfile&quot; programme in 2010.

In the 1980s, Nutkins was co-presenter of the BBC children&#x27;s television series &quot;Animal Magic&quot; with Johnny Morris, whom he describes as his second mentor after Maxwell. He is perhaps best remembered on the show for segments with Gemini, the California sea lion he had hand-reared from infancy. &quot;Animal Magic&quot;&#x27;s run ended in 1983 and a year later Nutkins was asked to put together a new animal series, which resulted in &quot;The Really Wild Show&quot; which he presented from 1986 to 1993. In 1999, he inherited a large portion of Johnny Morris&#x27;s estate.

Nutkins was part of a consortium which bought and later sold Fort Augustus Abbey on the shores of Loch Ness.
In 2004, he appeared on Living TV&#x27;s reality television show &quot;I&#x27;m Famous and Frightened!&quot;, and he featured in the 2007 Comic Relief video.
In April 2009, Nutkins co-presented and narrated &quot;My Life as an Animal&quot;, a BBC Three programme where young professionals and media personalities lived life as animals for four days, sharing living areas, food and sleeping with several farm and zoo animals. Nutkins made an appearance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Winterwatch&quot; programme (a spin off from &quot;Springwatch)&quot; talking about how otters had survived the harsh weather in January 2012.

Nutkins was a keen beekeeper and a member of the British Beekeepers&#x27; Association. A stone carving of Nutkins was unveiled at the Royal Horticultural Society Show in Tatton Park in 2010.

==Death==
Nutkins died on 6 September 2012, aged 66. He had been receiving treatment for nine months for acute leukaemia. He died at his home in Glenelg, Scotland, and was survived by his wife and eight children.

<text>In mathematics, projective differential geometry is the study of differential geometry, from the point of view of properties of mathematical objects such as functions, diffeomorphisms, and submanifolds, that are invariant under transformations of the projective group. This is a mixture of the approaches from Riemannian geometry of studying invariances, and of the Erlangen program of characterizing geometries according to their group symmetries. 

The area was much studied by mathematicians from around 1890 for a generation (by J. G. Darboux, George Henri Halphen, Ernest Julius Wilczynski, E. Bompiani, G. Fubini, Eduard Čech, amongst others), without a comprehensive theory of differential invariants emerging. Élie Cartan formulated the idea of a general projective connection, as part of his method of moving frames; abstractly speaking, this is the level of generality at which the Erlangen program can be reconciled with differential geometry, while it also develops the oldest part of the theory (for the projective line), namely the Schwarzian derivative, the simplest projective differential invariant.

Further work from the 1930s onwards was carried out by J. Kanitani, Shiing-Shen Chern, A. P. Norden, G. Bol, S. P. Finikov and G. F. Laptev. Even the basic results on osculation of curves, a manifestly projective-invariant topic, lack any comprehensive theory. The ideas of projective differential geometry recur in mathematics and its applications, but the formulations given are still rooted in the language of the early twentieth century.

<doc id="1242603" wikidata="Q811645" url="?curid=1242603" title="Lancashire Cotton Famine">
<text>The Lancashire Cotton Famine, also known as the Cotton Famine or the Cotton Panic (1861–1865), was a depression in the textile industry of North West England, brought about by overproduction in a time of contracting world markets. It coincided with the interruption of baled cotton imports caused by the American Civil War and speculators buying up new stock for storage in the shipping warehouses at the entrepôt. It also caused cotton prices to rise in China, in which trade had been steadily increasing following the Second Opium War and during the ongoing Taiping Rebellion. The increase in cotton prices caused the textile trade to rapidly lose two-thirds of its previous value of exports to China from 1861 to 1862. The worldwide cotton famine also produced a boom in cotton production in Egypt and Russian Turkestan.

The boom years of 1859 and 1860 had produced more woven cotton than could be sold and a cutback in production was needed. The situation was exacerbated by an overabundance of raw cotton held in the warehouses and dockyards of the ports and the market was flooded with finished goods, causing the price to collapse, while at the same time the demand for raw cotton fell. The price for raw cotton increased by several hundred percent due to blockade and lack of imports. The inaccessibility of raw cotton and the difficult trading conditions caused a change in the social circumstances of the Lancashire region&#x27;s extensive cotton mill workforce. Factory owners no longer bought large quantities of raw cotton to process and large parts of Lancashire and the surrounding areas&#x27; workers became unemployed and went from being the most prosperous workers in Britain to the most impoverished.

Local relief committees were set up and appealed for money locally and nationally. There were two major funds, the Manchester Central Committee and the Mansion House Committee of the Lord Mayor of London. The poorest applied for relief under the Poor Laws, through the Poor Law Unions. Local relief committees experimented with soup kitchens and direct aid. In 1862, sewing classes and industrial classes were organised by local churches and attendance merited a Poor Law payment. After the Public Works (Manufacturing Districts) Act 1864 was passed, local authorities were empowered to borrow money for approved public works. They commissioned the rebuilding of sewerage systems, cleaning rivers, landscaping parks and surfacing roads. In 1864, cotton imports were restored, the mills were put back into production but some towns had diversified and many thousands of operatives had emigrated.

== Background ==
The 1850s had been a period of unprecedented growth for the cotton industry in Lancashire, the High Peak of Derbyshire, and north east parts of Cheshire. The region had swamped the American market with printed cottons and was speculatively exporting to India. The populations of some mill towns in Lancashire and the surrounding region had almost doubled, the profit to capital ratio was running at more than 30 per cent, and a recession was looming. In 1861, the slave-owning southern states of America, where most of the world&#x27;s raw cotton was produced, declared their independence and attempted to secede from the United States of America. The situation quickly deteriorated, culminating in the outbreak of the American Civil War and leading to an immediate, protracted interruption of the cotton supply – initially by a voluntary boycott by Southern planters who believed a run on the cotton would quickly debilitate the British economy and force them to intervene on the South&#x27;s behalf. By the time it became clear that this strategy was ineffective, the resumption of cotton exports was prevented by the Union blockade of Southern ports.

In 1860, there were 2,650 cotton mills in the region, employing 440,000 people who were paid in total £11,500,000 per annum, of whom 90 per cent were adults and 56 per cent female. The mills used , of which 18,500 (, per cent) was generated by water power. The mills had 30.4 million spindles and 350,000 power looms. The industry imported of raw cotton a year. It exported 2.78 billion yards of cotton cloth and of twist and yarn. The total value of its exports was £32 million.


== First year ==
Unsold cloth had been building up in the warehouses in Bombay (Mumbai); production had exceeded demand and short time working was inevitable. As indications came that trouble was possible, the American growers hurried to export their crop early. Almost enough of the 1861 crop reached Liverpool to supply the mills. Middling Orleans, the type of cotton that was used to gauge the prices, was selling for d a pound in June 1861.

It was initially believed that British warehoused stocks of cotton would be adequate to see out the anticipated brief conflict. As all the Union advances early on were driven back, it became clear to European observers that the war would not be over quickly. By December, Middling Orleans was selling at d/lb. The merchants were holding onto their cotton, speculating on a price rise. By the beginning of 1862, mills were being closed and workers laid off; one-third of the families in one Lancashire cotton town were in receipt of relief. The price of Middling Orleans, which had been produced at a cost of d and bought by the merchants for 8d in 1861, rose to 2s. 3d. by October 1862, and to 2s. 5d. the following year. It is calculated that the merchants had a windfall of £35 million.

== Surat ==
Sea Island (also known as extra long staple), grown on the islands off the Carolina coast of America, was the best quality cotton; Egyptian — the name given to Sea Island cotton that had been introduced into Egypt — was the second best grade. The most common grades were the short staple Gossypium hirsutum (American upland) cottons which included Middling Orleans; it was these grades that were used by the majority of Lancashire&#x27;s calico producers. The Surat cottons from India were the least suitable for machinery and were only ever used as a small percentage of a mixture as the fibres were short and broke easily. Surat came in smaller bales which contained stones and other impurities. Each town in Lancashire used different mixtures and when the supply of American and Sea Island Cotton dried up, the mill owners moved over to Surat. Some machines could be adjusted to take it but extra humidity was needed to reduce breakages. Running a loom on Surat could only produce about 40 per cent of the previous throughput and, as workers were paid by the piece, their income was slashed.

Mill owners were also in difficulty as many of the smaller family-owned mills were mortgaged and if they stopped running the owners would fall behind with payments. Shopkeepers had no sales and could not afford the rents, workers defaulted on their rents and the landlord who stood the loss was often the mill owner. The wealthier mill owners such as Henry Houldsworth, were confident that the famine was temporary and planned for the new more efficient larger machinery that was becoming available, it was during the famine (1863–65) that he built Houldsworth Mill, Reddish, the first of the next generation of larger mills and at the time the world&#x27;s largest mill with 138,000 spindles. With most raw cotton unavailable, mill owners had to either close mills and attempt to help the workers financially, use inferior cotton or bring new cotton into production. Surat was available but mainly used internally in British India. Some limited increase in production was achieved. Attempts were made to establish Sea Island in Queensland and New Zealand and to grow short staple near Mumbai.

== Suffering ==
The cotton industry had become highly specialised by the 1860s and the severity of the famine in different towns depended on many factors. Some towns were built around mills using short fibre American cotton, while others used the longer fibre Egyptian cotton still available. Some mills had mules that could be adjusted to use a different cotton, while others did not. Owners of &quot;integrateds&quot; (mills that both spun and wove) could better balance the workload, thus preserving the precious raw material for longer. Some cautious mill owners always held stock in hand, while others bought as required.

The older paternalistic mill owners who lived among the local community were quick to divert their neighbours and workforce to maintenance work at their own expense. For example, in Glossop, Lord Howard called a family meeting of mill owners, clergy and &quot;respectable&quot; residents to take charge of the situation. Two relief committees were formed which experimented unsuccessfully with soup kitchens then set about distributing thousands of pounds worth of provisions, coal, clogs and clothing. Calico printer Edmund Potter loaned money to his workers and Howard took on extra workers on his estate. They set up schools, provided free brass band concerts, gave public readings from the Pickwick Papers and after the enactment of 1864 Public Works Act, took a loan to extend the waterworks. The only recorded tension was when the Relief Committee mistakenly decided to auction, instead of distributing free, a gift of food from the American federal government.

Towns with room and power mills and a strong co-operative tradition were quick to mitigate the social damage. The firms using them would rent the space and buy the machines on credit; cotton was cheap and the profit from the cloth was used to pay off the loan and provide a return for the risk. When cotton was unavailable they were the first to go bankrupt. After the famine the need was for more advanced machines and bigger mills. The investment required was too much for many private mill owners, and limited companies built the new larger mills. Limited companies developed fastest in the areas with a room and power tradition. Municipal authorities did not have the legal power to borrow money to finance public works until the 1864 Act; before this they had to use their own reserves, which varied from town to town.
== Panic ==
Some workers left Lancashire to work in the Yorkshire woollen and worsted industries. A small number of mills such as Crimble Mill, Heywood converted to woollen production buying in second hand fulling stocks, carding equipment, mules and looms. The towns of Stockport, Denton and Hyde diversified into hat making. Tameside was the worst affected district and suffered a net loss of population between 1861 and 1871. In 1864 there were 2,000 empty houses in Stockport and 686 in Glossop, along with 65 empty shops and fifteen empty beer houses. The exodus was caused primarily by evictions. The spring saw a wave of emigration stimulated by special agencies. The steamship companies cut their rates (steerage to New York cost £3 15s 6d), the Australian and New Zealand governments offered free passage, and 1,000 people had emigrated by August 1864, 200 of them from Glossop.

== Relief effort ==
Relief in times of hardship was governed by the Poor Relief Act 1601, which required Poor Law Guardians to find work for the fit. In rural communities this was stone breaking in the quarries, the mines etc. Outdoor work was quite unsuitable for men who had been working in the humid, heated mills, whose lungs had been damaged by cotton dust. The act only required that men &quot;be set to work as long as he continued to receive relief&quot;.

The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 had required parishes to come together to form Poor Law Unions to administer the relief. Their job was to minimise the cost to the parishes, which were compelled to finance their own poor. Paupers should be returned to their parishes of origin. Charles Pelham Villiers MP, the Poor Law Commissioner who represented an industrial constituency, wrote to the Poor Law Unions in September 1861 warning them of potential famine and instructing them to fulfil their duties with Compassion. Money had to be raised locally on the parish rates. H. B. Farnell, was appointed by Parliament to investigate the effects in Lancashire, where he started in May 1862 in Preston. He laid down a liberal interpretation of the Act and instructed gifts from charity should not be taken into account when assessing need. As an alternative to outdoor work, sewing classes were run by the churches which entitled the participants or &quot;scholars&quot; to receive benefit. Bible Reading classes followed and then industrial classes which taught reading, writing and simple maths with carpentry, shoemaking and tailoring. The Poor Law Unions were limited in the monies they could raise through rates and had no powers to borrow. Parliament passed the Union Relief Aid Act 1862 which allowed the burden be shared between the parishes and the county and then Public Works (Manufacturing Districts) Act 1864 authorised borrowing.

All those in work were encouraged to subscribe to charity and lists of subscribers were published. Local relief committees were set up to administer these funds, receiving other donations from the Mansion House Committee of London and Central Relief Committee of Manchester. The Mansion House Fund, more properly named the Lancashire and Cheshire Operatives Relief Fund, was set up on 16 May 1862, when £1,500 (equivalent to about £ in 2025) was sent to the distressed districts. Benefactors all over the United Kingdom, the Empire and across the world, raised money for the appeal. Between April 1862 and April 1863, £473,749 was collected and distributed (about £ in 2025). The Central Committee was formed 20 June 1862, composed of mayors of the affected towns; it put out an appeal letter to other towns across the country. A third fund, set up in June 1862 for slightly different purposes, was the Cotton Districts Relief Fund, which became part of the Central Committee.

== Stalybridge Riot ==
By the winter of 1862–1863 there were 7,000 unemployed operatives in Stalybridge, one of the worst affected towns. Only five of the town&#x27;s 39 factories and 24 machine shops were employing people full-time. Contributions were sent from all over the world for the relief of the cotton operatives in Cheshire and Lancashire and at one point three-quarters of Stalybridge workers were dependent on relief schemes. By 1863 there were 750 empty houses in the town. A thousand skilled men and women left the town in what became known as &quot;The Panic&quot;. In 1863 the local relief committee decided to substitute a system of relief by ticket instead of money. The tickets were to be presented at the shops of local grocers. On Thursday 19 March a public meeting resolved to resist the tickets. On Friday 20 March 1863, the officials of the relief committee went to the thirteen schools to offer the tickets, the men refused the tickets and turned out onto the streets. They stoned the cab of the departing official and then broke the windows of the shops owned by members of the relief committee, then turned to the depots of the relief committee which they sacked. By evening, a company of Hussars came from Manchester; the Riot Act was read and eighty men were arrested; women and girls continued to harangue the police and soldiers.

On Saturday 21 March, the magistrates released most of the prisoners but committed 28 for trial in Chester. They were taken to the railway station by police and soldiers, who were pelted with stones. A further public meeting demanded &quot;money and bread&quot; not &quot;tickets&quot;. Rioters demanded bread at various shops and in each case it was given to them. At 23:30, a company of infantry arrived and patrolled the streets with bayonets fixed. On the Sunday, supporters and visitors arrived in the town but there were no developments. On Monday 23 March the riot spread to Ashton, Hyde and Dukinfield. Schools had reopened but only 80 of the expected 1,700 students attended (agreed to be paid by ticket). Representatives were sent to the schools in the neighbouring towns to persuade the scholars to walk out but were met by soldiers. On the Tuesday the mobilisation ended, the relief committee offered to pay the outstanding tickets and to accept a delegation from the thirteen schools to discuss the matter further. The mayor offered that the MP John Cheetham would take the matter to parliament. The crowd believed that they had not lost relief and the ticket system would soon be abolished. 
The Stalybridge relief committee re-established authority. The Manchester Central Committee was critical of their poor management but they were being undermined by the Mansion House Fund of the Lord Mayor of London, which offered to distribute cash to scholars directly through the churches. The violence was blamed on outside agitators and the blame was put on an immigrant minority. Descriptions suggest about 3,500 participants, although there were only 1,700 scholars receiving aid.

== Public Works Manufacturing Districts Act 1864 ==

In March 1863, there were some 60,000–70,000 women attending sewing school and 20,000 men and boys attending classes. They were defined as doing useful work so could legally receive aid under the Poor Law legislation. There remained a further 25,000 men receiving aid but not doing any work. To Victorian thinking this was wrong and some means was needed to provide paid work. Local authorities did have work that needed to be done but no legal way to borrow to pay for it. The Public Works Manufacturing Districts Act 1864 became law 2 July 1863. This allowed public authorities to borrow money for public works. Cotton operatives could now be employed on useful projects.

The Lancashire area has a legacy of municipal parks that were created in this period such as Alexandra Park, Oldham. More important were the main sewers that were commissioned to replace the collapsing medieval drains and to bring sanitation to the hundreds of mill workers&#x27; cottages that supported the mills. Canals were dug, rivers straightened and new roads constructed such as the cobbled road on Rooley Moor above Norden known as the &quot;Cotton Famine Road&quot;. The public works commissioned in this period left a major impression on the infrastructure of the towns of Lancashire and the surrounding cotton areas.

== Cotton starts to flow ==
A trickle of raw cotton reached Lancashire in late 1863 but failed to get to the worst affected regions, being swallowed up in Manchester. The cotton was adulterated with stones but its arrival caused the principal operators to bring in key operators to prepare the mills. The American Civil War ended in April 1865. In August 1864, the first large consignment arrived and Wooley Bridge mill in Glossop reopened, giving all operatives a four and half day week. Employment then returned to normal. Raw cotton prices had risen from d in 1861 to d in 1864.
== Politics ==

The Confederacy hoped that distress in the European cotton manufacturing areas (similar hardships occurred in France), together with distaste in European ruling circles for democracy would lead to European intervention to force the Union to make peace on the basis of accepting secession of the Confederacy. After Union forces had repulsed a Confederate incursion at the Battle of Antietam in September 1862, Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation. Slavery had been abolished in the British Empire by the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 three decades earlier after a long campaign. The Unionists believed that all the British public would now see this as an antislavery issue rather than an anti-protectionism issue and would pressure its government not to intervene in favour of the South. Many mill owners and workers resented the blockade and continued to see the war as an issue of tariffs against free trade. Attempts were made to run the blockade by ships from Liverpool, London and New York. 71,751 bales of American cotton reached Liverpool in 1862. Confederate flags were flown in many cotton towns.

On 31 December 1862, a meeting of cotton workers at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester, despite their increasing hardship, resolved to support the Union in its fight against slavery. An extract from the letter they wrote in the name of the Working People of Manchester to His Excellency Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America says:

On 19 January 1863, Abraham Lincoln sent an address thanking the cotton workers of Lancashire for their support,


A monument in Brazenose Street, Lincoln Square, Manchester, commemorates the events and reproduces portions of both documents. The Abraham Lincoln statue by George Grey Barnard, 1919, was formerly located in the gardens at Platt Hall in Rusholme. The Federal American government sent a gift of food to the people of Lancashire. The first consignment was sent aboard the George Griswold. Other ships were the Hope and Achilles.

== Effects in other parts of the world ==
To moderate the effects of the cotton famine, the British tried to diversify its sources of cotton by making former subsistence farmers in British India, Egypt and elsewhere grow cotton for export often at the expense of staple food production. An attempt to grow cotton was also made on the island of Sicily. With the ending of the American Civil War, these new cotton farmers became redundant and their cotton was hardly demanded. This led to their impoverishment and aggravated various famines in these countries in the second half of the 19th century.

In China, the British enjoyed an increase in trade following the results of the Second Opium War and subsequent rise of exports to China by 30 percent from year 1859-1860. But with the outbreak of the American Civil War caused disruptions driving the price of cotton &quot;so high that the Chinese stopped buying from outside&quot;. The textile trade lost two-thirds of its value from 1861-1862 and kept falling.

Regions such as Australia, welcomed skilled spinners and weavers and encouraged their immigration.

== Legacy ==
In a 2015 article, economic historian Walker Hanlon finds that the cotton famine significantly affected the direction of technological progress in domains relevant to textiles manufacturing using Indian cotton, particularly for gins, openers and scutchers, and carding machines. This manifested in the major manufacturer Dobson &amp; Barlow utilizing four different gin designs over the course of four years, as well as a 19-30 percent reduction in wasted Indian cotton over the period from 1862 to 1868. Hanlon also finds that the relative price of Indian cotton to American cotton returned to its pre-Civil War level by 1874 despite significantly increasing in abundance, which is evidence of the &quot;strong induced-bias hypothesis&quot; as proposed by Daron Acemoglu.

English trad-folk group Faustus released their EP &quot;Cotton Lords&quot; in 2019, which takes five poems from the Lancashire Cotton Famine and sets them to music by Paul Sartin.

In 2022, Folk-Revival band :Bird in the Belly adapted two poems into song from the :University of Exeter Cotton Famine Poetry Archive. These appear on their album :After the City.

<doc id="1242607" wikidata="Q1406378" url="?curid=1242607" title="Tobruk (1967 film)">
<text>Tobruk is a 1967 American drama war film directed by Arthur Hiller and starring Rock Hudson and George Peppard. The film was written by Leo Gordon (who also acted in the film) and released through Universal Pictures.

Set in North Africa during the North African Campaign of World War II. It is a fictionalized story of members of the British Army&#x27;s Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) and the Special Identification Group (SIG) that endeavour to destroy the fuel bunkers of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Panzer Army Africa in Tobruk. The film is loosely based on the British attacks on Italian and German forces at Tobruk codenamed &quot;Operation Agreement&quot;. The film depicts the operation as being successful, even though actually Operation Agreement was a disastrous failure.

==Plot==
In September 1942, Rommel&#x27;s Africa Korps is only 90 miles (144 km) from the Suez Canal, but running dangerously low on fuel. The British approve a plan to destroy German fuel bunkers at Tobruk in an attempt to cripple Rommel&#x27;s attack.

The author of the plan, Canadian-born Major Donald Craig (Rock Hudson) of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) had been captured by Vichy French forces and is held prisoner, along with captured Italian Army soldiers, on a ship in the port of the French city of Algiers. As his expertise is considered essential to the success of the raid, Craig is rescued by Captain Kurt Bergman (George Peppard) of the Special Identification Group (SIG) and some of his men, German Jews serving with the British. They then join up with commandos of the Long Range Desert Group, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Harker (Nigel Green), at Kufra in southeastern Libya.

Colonel Harker explains they have eight days to get to Tobruk and destroy the fuel depot and German fortress artillery pieces protecting the harbour, before a scheduled amphibious landing and a bombing raid on the city by the Royal Air Force (RAF). They are to drive there through enemy territory posing as prisoners of war escorted by the SIG pretending to be guards. Once they reach Tobruk they would then link up with a full British naval and RAF assault on the city and their primary objective, Rommel&#x27;s underground fuel bunkers.

Craig is highly skeptical of the operation, claiming that &quot;Staff has a genius for sitting on its brains and coming up with perfect hindsight&quot;, stating that &quot;When I submitted the plan we could have blown up the fuel bunkers with a handful of men. How in hell are we supposed to get through their defenses now?&quot; While warning Craig not to let personal differences of opinion interfere with the operation, Colonel Harker also reveals that he was the genius with perfect hindsight who convinced Staff to approve Craig&#x27;s original plan which would now be &quot;maximum effort, land, sea and air&quot;.

On the way, they encounter a patrol of Italian tanks, which stops a short distance from where they are resting in a gully. Later that night, Sergeant Major Jack Tyne (Jack Watson) spots a tank column approaching from the opposite direction. After Bergman and three of his men kill the Italian sentries, Colonel Harker, surmising that the approaching column &quot;must be German -- the Italians are too fond of comfort to travel this late&quot;, tricks the two units into attacking each other by firing mortars, first at the Germans and then the Italians, enabling the raiders to sneak away.

To avoid detection the next day, Craig safely guides them through a German mine field, before they are attacked by a British Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter. They manage to shoot it down, but eight men are killed and one troop transport truck, their auxiliary fuel supply, and both of their radios are destroyed. The fighting attracts Tuareg tribesmen, who are friendly with the Germans. Craig, who speaks their language, exchanges some guns and ammunition for two prisoners.

The prisoners turn out to be British traitors Henry Portman (Liam Redmond), who has an Irish accent, and his daughter Cheryl (Heidy Hunt), who were shot down while flying from Benghazi to Cairo. They have papers signed by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem (Mohammad Amin al-Husayni) and German Field Marshal Albert Kesselring: an agreement for &quot;a group of important&quot; Egyptian army officers to rise up against the British in a &quot;holy war.&quot; The belief of the Germans is with Egypt conquered other Muslim, former Ottoman Empire states such as Turkey will then side with the Axis; Cheryl Portman states that the &quot;Turks, alone, could put four million men into the war against the Soviet Union.&quot;

That night, the Portmans are told by a mysterious SIG member about the British masquerade and where to find a gun and a map to an underground telephone cable nearby where they can contact German command in Tobruk and alert them to the British column and upcoming attack. When they reach the telephone, however, they are spotted by an Italian patrol. Henry Portman fires at the patrol and is killed, while his daughter is seriously wounded.

Harker sends Bergman and Sergeant Krug (Leo Gordon) after the Portmans where they retrieve Cheryl from the Italians. When Krug asks how they knew about the telephone, Bergman replies, &quot;Very simple. One among us is the enemy&quot;. Harker has Bergman and his men disarmed and then gives Bergman two hours to identify his traitor. The traitor kills Cheryl Portman so she cannot reveal his identity. Lieutenant Max Mohnfeld (Guy Stockwell), Bergman&#x27;s second in command, appears from the tunnel the Portmans used to escape. He states the traitor is down the shaft. They find Corporal Bruckner (Robert Wolders), one of Bergman&#x27;s closest friends for ten years, stabbed to death. Cheryl Portman had died from cyanide, and Bruckner&#x27;s suicide tablet is missing. Bergman, however, is not convinced his friend was the traitor.

The group passes through checkpoints just outside Tobruk and after traveling through the city, they discover to their surprise that Rommel has amassed his total reserve strength at Tobruk undetected: two full panzer divisions. The discovery of Rommel&#x27;s tanks puts the planned Naval assault in jeopardy, though without their radios the group have no way of warning Staff without taking the German transmitter located in the city which would alert the Germans.

The RAF then bomb Tobruk as scheduled. The LRDG blow up two of the harbour guns, and Harker orders Sergeant Major Tyne to signal the ships to abort the landing before the German tanks, which have pinned down Harker&#x27;s troops, can &quot;cut them to pieces&quot;. Harker also orders Lieutenant Boyden (Anthony Ashdown) to capture the German transmitter in the city in order to abort the landing and inform Staff of the Kesselring document. However, Boyden is killed during the bombing raid, as are Privates Alfie (Norman Rossington) and Dolan (Percy Herbert) when they discover millions in English pound notes the Germans had taken after capturing Tobruk from the British and attempt to steal the money (thereby making the German soldiers who kill them mistake them for looters and deserters). Meanwhile Mohnfeld, who volunteered to join them as Lt. Boyden did not speak German, is knocked out.

Bergman and three of his men escape on sidecar motorcycles and manage to destroy a tank and use flame throwers to buy Harker time; however, Bergman and his men are eventually killed. Meanwhile, Craig, Krug, and two other SIG men use the distraction to escape and seize a German tank well inland. After they use the tank to destroy the fuel depot, Harker and his men surrender.

Mohnfeld then appears where he reveals that he is really a German intelligence officer named von Kruger, explaining that he had told the truth the night before, only altering that &quot;The Jew found me in the tunnel&quot; and asks Harker for the Kesselring document. However, upon seeing the destruction of the fuel bunkers, Harker had burned the paper knowing its importance to the Germans. Harker then kills von Kruger with his pistol and is himself shot dead.

Craig, Krug and the two others manage to escape and exhausted after traveling over 70 miles on foot, make it to a scheduled back up rendezvous with a Royal Navy ship at Sallum just over the Egyptian border.

==Production==
===Development===
The film was based on an original script by Leo Gordon, who also worked as an actor. Gordon took the script to producer Gene Corman, whom he had worked with several times before. Corman originally intended to make the film on a relatively low budget, around a million dollars, for United Artists – he had just made &quot;The Secret Invasion&quot; (1964) for that studio.

The scope of the film changed when Corman discovered Rock Hudson, then one of the biggest stars in the world, was about to leave his home studio of Universal because he was unhappy with the roles he had been playing (he had just signed to make &quot;Seconds&quot; at Paramount). Corman showed the script to Hudson who liked it, and he succeeded in getting the film financed at Universal, who wanted to keep Hudson within its fold. The film was a co production between Universal, Gibraltar Productions (Rock Hudson&#x27;s company), and the Corman Co.

The film was known at one stage as &quot;The Cliffs at Mersa&quot; and &quot;The Cliffs&quot;. Hudson came on board in May 1965 (he would make it after &quot;Blindfold&quot; and &quot;Seconds&quot;) and Peppard was signed to co star with Hudson in July 1965, at a fee of $400,000.

Laurence Harvey was originally slated to play the role of Major Craig, while Dirk Bogarde was originally offered the role of Colonel Harker, but he declined.

Corman approached John Huston to direct who was interested. However, he wanted a fee of $500,000 and Universal was reluctant to use the director considering his recent films had been commercial failures. The job of directing eventually went to Arthur Hiller.

Corman budgeted the film at two-and-a-half million dollars. Universal felt it should be made for $5 million, but Corman was reluctant to make the movie for that much. His own fee was $200,000 while Gordon was paid $40,000 for his script. Corman wanted to shoot the film in North Africa with studio work done in England; however, Universal insisted it be shot in America as the studio was reluctant to film in Europe again after &quot;A Man Could Get Killed&quot; (also known as &quot;Welcome Mr. Beddoes&quot;) went over budget.

Gordon wrote himself a role as Sgt Tyne. Gordon normally played characters who died and wrote the script so Tyne did not die. Corman agreed to Gordon playing a role but only if the script was changed so Tyne died. Gordon instead decided to play the character of Krug, who lived.

Corman later commentated that Gordon &quot;was a very witty, interesting conversationalist. His appearance probably worked to his disadvantage because to have him walk into a story conference was somewhat intimidating! I remember on Tobruk having director Arthur Hiller, who is a fey, gentle soul, taken aback when he met Leo – it took two or three story conferences before he could come to grips with that size and bulk.&quot;

===Shooting===
It was photographed in Technicolor using the Techniscope format, and shot in Almería, Spain and the Glamis Sand Dunes in the Imperial Valley, of southern California in the United States. The film had a budget of US$6 million.

Technical advice and assistance was provided by the 40th Armored Division (&quot;Grizzly&quot;) of the California Army National Guard.

In the convoy heading to Tobruk the trucks used are actually M135 and M54, while the Sd.Kfz. 7&#x27;s are American M3 halftracks with altered bodies. The tanks in the Italian column are in fact M48 Pattons.

Producer Gene Corman would again use Tobruk&#x27;s Nazi occupation as the background in his 1990 parody film &quot;A Man Called Sarge&quot;, although this time set during the Second Battle of El Alamein, in late 1942.

==Reception==
&quot;Filmink&quot; argued &quot;there’s annoyingly no mention of Australians.&quot;
==Use of footage==
The 1971 war film &quot;Raid on Rommel&quot;, directed by Henry Hathaway and starring Richard Burton, made extensive use of combat footage from &quot;Tobruk&quot; and also featured a very similar story-line about a British commando force infiltrating enemy lines and raiding the Afrika Korps supply bases.

==Academy Awards==
Albert Whitlock and Howard A. Anderson were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

==Home media==
Universal first released this film on VHS on April 23, 1992 and again on May 15, 2002 in pan-and-scan format. It was released on DVD on June 12, 2012 as part of the made-on-demand &quot;Universal Vault Series&quot;. On January 21, 2020, &quot;Tobruk&quot; was released on Blu-ray by Kino International under its subsidiary &quot;Kino Lorber Studio Classics&quot; with licensing by Universal Pictures.

The R1 DVD release has no optional English subtitles and thus, the non-English dialogue in the film is not translated. The Blu-ray contains optional English subtitles with limited non-English ones during certain scenes and dialogue; the film&#x27;s theatrical trailer is also included as a bonus feature (in pan-and-scan format).

There are also various Region 2 DVD and Region B Blu-ray releases.

==Comics adaptation==
Oliver Passingham adapted the film into a comic book version, published by the Lion Summer Spectacular.

<text>The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier () is a monument located in Bucharest, Romania. Dedicated to the soldiers who died while fighting for Romania, it is one of many such national tombs across the world.

The monument was built in 1923 to commemorate Romanian soldiers who died during World War I.

==History==
In 1923 it was decided to choose one of the fallen soldiers to represent all who had sacrificed their lives during the war.

The order no. 567/1 May 1923 of the Ministry of War ruled that a war orphan in the 1st grade of a military school would choose the coffin of the Unknown Soldier. The military schools in Iași, Craiova, Chișinău and Dealu Monastery submitted the names of their best students who met the respective criteria. Out of the four candidates the war orphan Amilcar Săndulescu, a 12-year student at the Dimitrie Sturdza Military High School in Craiova (nowadays &quot;Tudor Vladimirescu&quot; Military College), whose father died on the front in 1917, was selected.

Ten unidentified soldiers who died at Mărășești, Mărăști, Oituz, Târgu Ocna, Jiu, Prahova, Bucharest, in Dobruja, Transylvania and Bessarabia were exhumed and laid in oak coffins, doubled with zinc, inside the &quot;Assumption of Mary&quot; Church in Mărășești.

On May 14, 1923, during the solemn ceremony organized at Mărășești, Amilcar Săndulescu knelt in front of the fourth coffin and said: &quot;This is my father&quot;. After the Unknown Soldier had been chosen, the other nine coffins were buried with military honors in the Heroes&#x27; Cemetery in Mărășești.

On May 15, 1923, the Unknown Soldier&#x27;s coffin, wrapped in a Romanian Tricolor, was placed on board of a special train to Bucharest, where it was waited for by the King Ferdinand, state officials and an honor guard. Laid on a cannon carriage pulled by eight horses, the coffin was transported in a long procession to the &quot;Mihai Vodă&quot; Church and remained there for 2 more days, so the people could pay their last respects.

On May 17, 1923 (which was also Heroes&#x27; Day/Ascension Day), the coffin was buried inside a crypt in Carol Park with full military honors in the presence of the royal family, the Government, members of Parliament, and numerous members of the public. The stone slab of the crypt read: &quot;Here lies at rest happily unto the Lord the Unknown Soldier, who sacrificed his life for the unity of the Romanian people. On his bones lies the land of united Romania. 1916–1919.&quot;

On June 6, 1923, The United States War Department announced that the Congressional Medal of Honor was to be awarded to the Romanian Unknown Soldier. This is one of only five U.S. Medals of Honor to be awarded to soldiers of foreign armies allied with the United States during World War I. 

On the night of December 22/23, 1958, the Unknown Soldier&#x27;s monument was dismantled and moved, in great secrecy, to the Mărășești Mausoleum by the Communist regime to make room for the Mausoleum of the Communist Heroes, where several leaders of the Party were later interred (among them Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej).

In 1991, after the fall of the regime, the Tomb was moved back into the Carol Park, closer to its original location.

In 2007 the Tomb was moved even closer to its original 1923 location, right next to the Communist mausoleum.

<doc id="1242647" wikidata="Q330685" url="?curid=1242647" title="Sigelwara Land">
<text>&quot;Sigelwara Land&quot; is an essay by J. R. R. Tolkien that appeared in two parts, in 1932 and 1934. It explores the etymology of the Old English word for the ancient Aethiopians, , and attempts to recover what it might originally have meant. Tolkien suggested that its two elements were most likely sun/jewel and coal/hearth, perhaps meaning something like a soot-black fire-demon.

The Tolkien scholar and philologist Tom Shippey suggests that Tolkien&#x27;s detailed study of the word may have influenced him in his creation of elements of his fantasy world of Middle-earth, including the Silmarils or forged sun-jewels, the Balrogs or dark fire-demons, and the Haradrim, men of the hot south.

== Essay ==
Tolkien&#x27;s essay treats the etymology of the Old English word for the ancient Aethiopians, . Tolkien concluded that, while the meaning of the first element was evidently &quot;Sun&quot;, the meaning of the second element was not definitely recoverable, but might be guessed at:

The phrase appears in &quot;Exodus&quot;, a free translation of the Book of Exodus (Codex Junius 11):
The main thrust of Tolkien&#x27;s argument in this two-part paper seems to have been that was a corruption of , and had come to mean something different in its later form than it had in its original. He begins by pointing out that Ethiopians in the earliest writings are presented in a very positive light, but by the time they written of as &quot;Sigelwarans&quot;, the perception has become the opposite. He does not speculate why, but instead demonstrates a clear relationship between and and shows how discovering the original meaning of the word is almost impossible; that trying to do so must be &quot;for the joy of the hunt rather than the hope of a final kill&quot;.

The word as a conflation of two words, the inherited word for Sun, the feminine and an Old English neuter or for &quot;jewel, necklace&quot;, loaned from Latin .

Suggesting a connection of with Gothic 𐌷𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌹 &quot;coal&quot;, Old Norse &quot;fire&quot;, Old English &quot;to roast&quot;, &quot;hearth&quot;, Tolkien tentatively concludes that in the we may be looking at &quot;rather the sons of Muspell than of Ham&quot;, an ancient class of demons &quot;with red-hot eyes that emitted sparks and faces black as soot&quot;, English equivalent of the Norse fire giants ruled by Surtr,
that had been forgotten even before the composition of this version of &quot;Exodus&quot;.

== Influence on Tolkien&#x27;s fiction ==
Tom Shippey notes that the demons &quot;with red-hot eyes&quot; make appearances in Tolkien&#x27;s fiction as Balrogs.

One of the many peoples encountered in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are &quot;black men like half-trolls&quot;. This description recalls the as black demons; furthermore their homeland of Far Harad, the great southern region of Middle-earth, recalls Sub-Saharan Africa, sometimes referred to as in pre-modern times. In drafts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; Tolkien toyed with names such as &quot;Harwan&quot; and &quot;Sunharrowland&quot; for the Haradrim generally and their land; Christopher Tolkien notes these names are derived from the Old English Sigelwara, and refers to Tolkien&#x27;s essay &quot;Sigelwara Land&quot;.

<text>Patrick William McEnroe (born July 1, 1966) is an American former professional tennis player, broadcaster, and former captain of the United States Davis Cup team.

Born in Manhasset, New York, he is John McEnroe&#x27;s youngest brother. He won one singles title and 16 doubles titles, including the 1989 French Open. His career-high rankings were world No. 28 in singles and world No. 3 in doubles.

On May 1, 2023, McEnroe began his tenure as President of the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

==Juniors==
McEnroe started playing tennis as a young boy and was taught at the Port Washington Tennis Academy, where his brother John also played. As a junior, Patrick reached the semifinals of Wimbledon and the US Open boys&#x27; singles in 1983. He partnered with Luke Jensen to win the French junior doubles and the USTA Boys&#x27; 18 National and Clay Court titles in 1984. He also made his first impact on the professional tour that year, teaming up with brother John to win the doubles title at Richmond, Virginia. He won the men&#x27;s doubles gold medal at the 1987 Pan American Games with Jensen, and helped Stanford University win the NCAA team championship in 1986 and 1988. While at Stanford, he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. McEnroe graduated from Stanford in 1988 with a degree in political science, and then joined the professional tennis tour.

==Professional career==

In 1989, McEnroe won the French Open men&#x27;s doubles title and the Masters doubles title, partnering with Jim Grabb.

His first career singles final came in 1991 at Chicago, where he faced his brother John, who won the match 3–6, 6–2, 6–4. (This was the second time in tour history where two brothers faced each other in a tournament final, after Emilio Sánchez and Javier Sánchez met in the Madrid final in 1987.)

His best Grand Slam singles performance came at the 1991 Australian Open, where he reached the semifinals before being knocked-out by eventual-champion Boris Becker. (Commenting on his fellow semifinalists, he told the press: &quot;It&#x27;s just like you all expected – Edberg, Lendl, McEnroe and Becker&quot;.) He was also runner-up in the men&#x27;s doubles at the Australian Open that year, partnering with his former Stanford teammate David Wheaton.

McEnroe won the men&#x27;s singles at the Sydney Outdoor Championships in 1995, to claim his only career singles title. He also had some notable Grand Slam singles results that year – beating Boris Becker in the first round of the Australian Open (before eventually losing in the fourth round), and then reaching the quarterfinals of the US Open where he lost to Becker in an epic four-hour and seven-minute four-set marathon.

McEnroe acted as a catalyst for fellow tennis champion (and older brother John&#x27;s own rival) Jimmy Connors&#x27;s run during the 1991 US Open. In the first round of the 1991 US Open, McEnroe led Connors two sets and 3–0 in the third set but Connors came back to win in five sets, walking off the court at 1:35 in the morning, after 4 hours and 18 minutes of play.

McEnroe retired from the professional tour in 1998.

===Davis Cup===
In the Davis Cup, McEnroe represented his country as a doubles player in 1993, 1994 and 1996, compiling a 3–1 record. In 2000, after older-brother John resigned following an unhappy 14-month spell as captain, he was named the 38th captain of the United States Davis Cup team.

With McEnroe as captain, the Davis Cup team won the Cup for the U.S. in December 2007. He resigned the position of team captain on September 6, 2010. His time as captain is the longest of any US Davis Cup captain.

===General manager of USTA player development===
In 2008, McEnroe became general manager of USTA player development. A series of mandates aimed at promoting junior tennis, including a requirement that all players age ten and under (U10) compete on miniature courts using new lightweight &quot;green dot&quot; tennis balls, have been controversial. The smaller format is designed to make tennis more accessible to children but critics argue that it will inhibit development. Coach Robert Lansdorp said in September 2013 that the format &quot;is wrong for the very talented players&quot; that become champions and noted that Maria Sharapova, Monica Seles and the Williams sisters were already competing on regular courts by age 7.

In 2012, tennis coach Wayne Bryan, father of the Bryan brothers, wrote a letter expressing concern about the effects USTA mandates were having on players and coaches around the country. McEnroe responded, calling Bryan&#x27;s criticisms &quot;scattershot&quot; and &quot;filled with holes, hearsay and half truths&quot;. At the December 2012 &quot;Riv It Up&quot; USPTA Education Event held at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, California, professional coaches united to support Bryan in a &quot;packed&quot; meeting with USTA director Craig Jones that drew attendees from as far away as Arizona. Fox News commentator Sean Hannity, the father of two junior players, posted his own analysis online &quot;urging the immediate reversal of the USTA&#x27;s new rules for juniors competition&quot;. Former world No. 1, John McEnroe, owner of Sportime Tennis Center on Randalls Island, New York, agrees that the tennis federation his younger brother Patrick advocates is unlikely to produce a champion.

On September 3, 2014, Patrick McEnroe was relieved of his duties as Head of Player Development for the USTA. Jon Wertheim of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reports McEnroe was &quot;forced out of his job&quot; after a six-year tenure. The announcement was made during the US Open Tennis Championship in Flushing Meadows, New York, where for the second consecutive year, and only the second time in its 134-year history, no American men advanced past the third round. It is the latest indicator that the United States has lost its place in the upper echelon of professional tennis. The last American man to win a Grand Slam title was Andy Roddick in 2003.

On April 5, 2015, Martin Blackman was announced as the new Head of Player Development for the USTA.

==Broadcast career==
McEnroe currently works as a broadcaster for ESPN and a contributor to CNN. He previously worked for CBS from 1996 to 2008. McEnroe has worked for ESPN since 1995, where his versatility allows him to work play-by-play, as a studio host, or analyst. He is regularly paired with his brother John or Darren Cahill. Patrick works as the lead play-by-play man for many of ESPN&#x27;s tennis events.

==Personal life==
On December 19, 1998, McEnroe married singer and actress Melissa Errico. They have three daughters, Victoria Penny (born 2006) and twins Juliette Beatrice and Diana Katherine (born 2008). They live in Bronxville, New York.

==Honors==
* McEnroe served as captain of the US men&#x27;s tennis team at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.
* In November 2012, McEnroe was announced as a 2013 recipient of the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award, presented annually to six distinguished former college student-athletes on the 25th anniversary of the end of their college sports careers.

<text>Sonor is a German musical instrument manufacturing company headquartered in Bad Berleburg. Established in 1875, it is one of the oldest percussion companies in the world. Sonor currently manufactures drum kits and hardware.

Apart from drum kits, Sonor also manufactured a wide range of other percussion instruments through its history. Some of them were frame drums, bongo drums, djembes, Cajons, timbales, congas, tambourines, maracas, guiros, glockenspiel, cymbals and mallets.

==History==
The company was founded in 1875 as a percussion instruments manufacturer. One of the oldest existing models of drums manufactured by Sonor is a 1942 Johannes Link Parade Snare, a very heavy snare drum with an aluminum shell and thick tension rods.
In the 1980s, Sonor&#x27;s tagline was &quot;The Rolls of drums&quot;. The drums were made of very thick (13 mm) and heavy shells that were beech wood, with an innermost and outermost ply of furniture-grade veneers, such as rosewood and bubinga. Nicko McBrain of Iron Maiden was one of the most prominent Sonor artists of the 1980s and 1990s, along with Mikkey Dee of Motörhead, Steve Smith of Journey, Phil Rudd of AC/DC, Danny Carey of Tool, Thomas Haake of Meshuggah, Glenn Kotche of Wilco, Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree, jazz/fusion artist Jojo Mayer and jazz legend Jack DeJohnette.

Sonor invented the modern screw thread drum-construction and the metal snare drum in the early 20th century. William F. Ludwig got this idea in his early years back in Germany from Sonor and began to use it later in Chicago.

As the 1980s progressed, the market began to stray away from thick heavy shells and Sonor started slimming down its shells with a line called &quot;Sonorlite&quot; and &quot;Hilite&quot;, a step more towards the idea a drum shell should resonate like a violin or guitar body. The thinner the shell, the lower the fundamental tone.

Sonor drums have several design features, including undersized shells (a similar concept to a violin bridge - designed to enhance response), and tension rods that are round and feature a slot instead of the traditional square style (though recently Sonor made square heads standard, with slotted heads available as an option). Recently, Sonor re-introduced the designer X-Ray Acrylic drums, the first time in 20 years Sonor offered acrylic drums. These shells are made from seamless, extruded acrylic and feature acrylic hoops.

In 1953, the Orff instruments were officially included in Sonor’s production plan. In close collaboration with Professor Hans Bergese, a student of Carl Orff, Sonor developed a range of instruments. The basic idea was that the instruments should grow with the mental abilities and playing techniques of the child, thus encouraging active music making.

<doc id="1242652" wikidata="Q4273978" url="?curid=1242652" title="Samantha Bee">
<text>Samantha Anne Bee (born October 25, 1969) is a Canadian-American comedian, writer, producer, political commentator, actress, and television host.

Bee rose to fame as a correspondent on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, where she became the longest-serving regular correspondent. In 2015, she departed the show after 12 years to start her own show, &quot;Full Frontal with Samantha Bee&quot;. The show was canceled in 2022 as a &quot;business-based decision&quot; by TBS.

In 2017, &quot;Time&quot; named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual &quot;Time&quot; 100 list.

==Early life==
Bee was born in Toronto, Ontario, the daughter of Debra and Ronald Bee. She has said of her family: &quot;Dating from well before the turn of the 20th century, if there has ever been a successful, happy marriage in my family lineage, I&#x27;ve yet to hear about it.&quot; Bee&#x27;s parents split up soon after her birth, and she was initially raised by her grandmother, who worked as a secretary at the Catholic school Bee attended, on Roncesvalles Avenue during her childhood. She attended Humberside Collegiate Institute and York Memorial Collegiate Institute.

After graduating from high school, Bee attended McGill University, where she studied humanities. Dissatisfied with a range of issues at the school, she transferred to the University of Ottawa after her first year. At the University of Ottawa, Bee signed up for a theatre class, thinking it would be easy. The class led to Bee discovering her love of performing. Bee later enrolled in the George Brown Theatre School in Toronto.

==Career==

===Career beginnings===
Bee started auditioning for acting roles in Toronto while working as a waitress. At age 26, Bee toured with a stage production of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; where she played the titular role. Bee performed in &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;″s &quot;A&quot; cast and future husband Jason Jones was a member of the &quot;B&quot; cast.

Bee was one of the four founding members of Toronto-based sketch comedy troupe The Atomic Fireballs. The Fireballs were all women. Demonstrating mutual support, the group would try to perform as many of each other&#x27;s ideas as they could.

===2003–2014 at &quot;The Daily Show&quot;===
Bee became a correspondent for &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; on July 10, 2003. Bee was the sole female correspondent on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; from her debut in 2003 until Kristen Schaal joined the show in March 2008. She was &quot;The Daily Show&quot;″s first non-US citizen correspondent. On that program, Bee demonstrated an ability to coax people into caricaturing themselves—particularly in segments like &quot;Kill Drill&quot;, on hunters and fossil fuel executives claiming to be environmentalists; &quot;They So Horny?&quot;, on the dearth of Asian men in U.S. pornography; &quot;Tropical Repression&quot;, on Ed Heeney, a Florida politician running his campaign based on opposition to gay rights; &quot;The Undecided&quot;, an over-the-top look at the undecided voters leading up to the 2004 US presidential elections; the &quot;Samantha Bee&#x27;s So You Want To Bee A...&quot; report series, which humorously caricatured the way in which one can easily obtain a certain job, like becoming a 527 group; and a segment entitled &quot;NILFs&quot; (&quot;News I&#x27;d Like to F#@k&quot;), discussing the sexiness of news anchors: &quot;CNN has the wholesome girl-next-door NILFs, the kind you can bring home to meet your mother. MSNBC has the dirty-over-30 NILFs. Fox has the filthy NILFs who will report anything. They&#x27;re the &quot;Hustler&quot; of NILFs.&quot;

Bee had her first starring role in a feature film in 2004 with the Canadian independent film &quot;Ham &amp; Cheese&quot;, co-written by her husband Jason Jones and starring Canadian comics Scott Thompson and Dave Foley. The film marked Bee&#x27;s first starring role. She won a Canadian Comedy Award for &quot;Pretty Funny Female Performance&quot; for her role. Jones joined &quot;The Daily Show&quot; as a correspondent in 2005, two years after his wife. Jones became a freelance correspondent for the show while Bee reduced her workload during her pregnancy.
In December 2005, on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, Bill O&#x27;Reilly used a clip of Bee from &quot;The Daily Show&quot; as an example of &quot;The War on Christmas&quot;, presenting it as having aired recently. The satirical clip featured Bee mentioning how Christmas was the only religious holiday that&#x27;s also a federal holiday in the United States, with O&#x27;Reilly talking about &quot;Secular Central...excuse me, Comedy Central&quot;. Jon Stewart responded on his show; inviting Bee out for a discussion, and unlike in the clip that aired on &quot;Factor&quot;, Bee was visibly eight months pregnant. Bee joked it was obvious that the footage O&#x27;Reilly showed was a year old (it originally aired in 2004) because she had different highlights in her hair, before stating that her water had just broken. Bee was recognized with a 2005 Canadian Comedy Award for Best Female TV Performance for her work on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;.

On January 20, 2008, Bee finished as the highest scoring celebrity in the CBC game show &quot;Test the Nation&quot;. She had a minor role in Episode 15, &quot;Spy Something or Get Out&quot;, of &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot;. Bee also appeared in the 12th episode of Season 20 of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (&quot;Blackmail&quot;, episode 445), which aired on January 15, 2010. She played a minor role in an episode of the HBO series &quot;Bored to Death&quot;. She appeared as herself on the &quot;Madame President&quot; episode of &quot;The Electric Company&quot;. Bee also did a guest voice role of a talk show hostess named Pam in the Season 2 finale of &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;, in addition to providing the voice of Lyla Lolliberry for two episodes in Season 4 of &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;. She appeared on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; during Season 42 as Mother Goose.
In 2009, Bee appeared in the original cast of &quot;Love, Loss, and What I Wore&quot;. That same year, she had a small role in the comedy &quot;Whatever Works&quot;, written and directed by Woody Allen.

Bee authored a book titled &quot;I Know I Am, But What Are You?&quot;, which was published in 2010. She became the longest-serving regular &quot;Daily Show&quot; correspondent after passing Stephen Colbert&#x27;s record in 2011. The same year, Bee collaborated with her longtime friend Allana Harkin on the parenting blog &quot;Eating Over the Sink&quot; for the online magazine &quot;Babble&quot;. In 2012, she appeared in Ken Finkleman&#x27;s series &quot;Good God&quot; as Shandy Sommers, a devoutly Christian cable news host. She has also played roles in the series &quot;Bounty Hunters&quot; and &quot;Game On&quot;. In 2014, Bee was a panellist on &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, the CBC&#x27;s annual national book debate. She defended Rawi Hage&#x27;s novel &quot;Cockroach&quot;. On October 7, 2014, in the absence of Jon Stewart, she co-hosted &quot;The Daily Show&quot; with Jones.

===2015–2022: &quot;Full Frontal with Samantha Bee&quot;===

In March 2015, it was announced that she would leave &quot;The Daily Show&quot; – after 12 years – to host her own satirical news show on TBS. Bee departed &quot;The Daily Show&quot; on April 30, 2015. Her new show, &quot;Full Frontal with Samantha Bee&quot;, debuted on February 8, 2016. With the program&#x27;s debut, Bee became the first woman to host a late-night satire show. Bee also tried to implement a hiring process which would give her show a more diverse staff than what is typical for a late night comedy show. The first season of &quot;Full Frontal&quot; generated critical acclaim and in November 2016, the show was renewed for a second season throughout 2017.

Bee is an executive producer of the TBS comedy series &quot;The Detour&quot; (2016–2019), which she created with her husband, Jason Jones. One year into Bee&#x27;s run on &quot;Full Frontal&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; named Bee one of the 100 most influential people in the world. On April 29, 2017, &quot;Full Frontal with Samantha Bee&quot; hosted &quot;Not the White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner&quot; which aired on TBS the same evening. In July 2017, Bee&#x27;s &quot;Nasty Woman Shirt&quot; campaign raised over $1 million for Planned Parenthood. In January 2018, TBS renewed &quot;Full Frontal&quot; for a third and fourth season, set to air through 2020. Bee&#x27;s deal with Turner runs through 2022.

In 2018, Bee faced backlash on social media and from the White House for calling Ivanka Trump a &quot;feckless cunt&quot;, while criticizing her stance as a mother regarding the immigration policy of Donald Trump. The comments were made in the context of highlighting the administration&#x27;s actions on immigration and the separation of undocumented children from their parents. Critics on Twitter started a hashtag calling for a boycott of TBS network until Bee&#x27;s show is canceled. The day after the segment aired, Bee apologized and &quot;deeply [regretted]&quot; the comment. Comedians Kathy Griffin, Michelle Wolf, Sarah Silverman, and Jon Stewart defended Bee, with Stewart suggesting much of the outrage over the joke was strategic rather than genuine. The show featured fewer national advertisements the following week. Bee began the episode with an apology to any women she had offended and lamenting that one bad word had overshadowed the policy of detaining undocumented immigrant children which she had been criticizing.

In 2018, Bee formed a production company called Swimsuit Competition, focused on creating original content for television, aiming to work with underrepresented talent and those whose work has been underestimated in the past. The company signed a first-look deal with TBS. Full Frontal producer Kristen Everman was named head of development.

She appeared as Jillian on the revived &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, released in May 2022.

On July 25, 2022, Bee&#x27;s representatives announced that TBS had not renewed &quot;Full Frontal&quot; for a seventh season, and was officially canceled by TBS.

In 2023, Bee was named as the host of the 11th Canadian Screen Awards broadcast on April 16.

==Influences==
Bee has credited Jon Stewart as one of her major influences, and in several interviews she has said that her other comedic influences include Steve Martin, David Letterman, Mary Tyler Moore, Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett, Betty White, and Joan Rivers.

==Personal life==
In 2001, Bee married actor and writer Jason Jones, whom she first met in 1996. They reside in Manhattan, New York. In January 2006, she gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Piper, then returned to &quot;The Daily Show&quot; in March 2006. On January 24, 2008, Bee announced a second pregnancy on air during a bit about the media&#x27;s coverage of the 2008 presidential campaign, and gave birth to their second child, a son named Fletcher, later that year. Their third child, a daughter named Ripley, was born in late 2010. During her third pregnancy, Bee joked she and Jones were &quot;just procreating like we&#x27;re farmers.&quot;

Bee holds dual Canadian-American citizenship after being naturalized in 2014.

<doc id="1242656" wikidata="Q1061402" url="?curid=1242656" title="Gretsch">
<text>Gretsch is an American company that manufactures and markets musical instruments. The company was founded in 1883 in Brooklyn, New York by Friedrich Gretsch, a 27-year-old German immigrant, shortly after his arrival to the United States. Friedrich Gretsch manufactured banjos, tambourines, and drums until his death in 1895. In 1916, his son, Fred Gretsch Sr. moved operations to a larger facility where Gretsch went on to become a prominent manufacturer of American musical instruments. Through the years, Gretsch has manufactured a wide range of instruments, though they currently focus on electric and acoustic guitars and drums.

Gretsch instruments enjoyed market prominence by the 1950s. In 1954, Gretsch began a collaboration with guitarist Chet Atkins to manufacture a line of electric guitars with Atkins&#x27; endorsement, resulting in the Gretsch 6120 hollowbody guitar and other later models such as the Country Gentleman. Electric guitars before 1957 used single coil pickups that have significant hum problems as an inherent part of their design. Frustration with the hum of these pickups prompted Atkins to collaborate with American inventor and engineer Ray Butts on the development of a new &quot;humbucking&quot; pickup by connecting two single-coil pickups serially and out of phase. This resulted in what may have been the first humbucker pickup (a claim lost to Gibson Guitars because Gibson was able to file a patent for their humbucker design first). Butts&#x27; design became the Gretsch Filter&#x27;Tron and was used on Gretsch guitars beginning in 1957, and is highly regarded for its unique sound properties. The popularity of Gretsch guitars soared in the mid-1960s because of its association with Beatles guitarist George Harrison, who played Gretsch guitars beginning in the band&#x27;s early years.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Gretsch was founded in 1883 by Friedrich Gretsch, a young German immigrant who opened his own musical instrument shop on 128 Middleton Street in Brooklyn, New York that year. His shop was designed for the manufacture of banjos, tambourines and drums, with the company experiencing some success catering to marching bands. The operation moved to South 4th Street in 1894. In 1895, Gretsch died at the age of 39 and the company was taken over by his wife and fifteen-year-old son Fred.

Fred Gretsch expanded the business, incorporating it and adding Gretsch Building #1 at 109 South 5th Street in 1903, Gretsch Building #2 at 104-114 South 4th Street in 1910, and a new ten-story Gretsch Building #4 at 60 Broadway in 1916. The company ultimately owned or operated six properties in the immediate area, including a warehouse on Dunham Place. Gretsch Building #4 was owned by the Gretsch family until 1999.

The first Gretsch branded guitar was produced in 1928, but was one of 3000 instruments in the Gretsch catalog, with it still being primarily a drum company.

WWII marked a transitional period for Gretsch when Fred Gretsch Sr. handed over the family business to his son, Fred Gretsch Jr., after retiring in 1942. Soon after taking over, Fred Jr. left to serve as a Navy commander, leaving the business in the hands of his younger brother, William Walter &quot;Bill&quot; Gretsch. Bill Gretsch died in 1948 and the company was again run by Fred Jr.

In the post-war period, Gretsch brought a greater focus on electric guitars. Fred Jr and Gretsch employees Christopher &#x27;Duke&#x27; Kramer and Jimmie Webster worked with Chet Atkins to overhaul the look and sound of Gretsch electric guitars.

===1950s &amp; 1960s===


By the mid-1950s the company introduced several models, including the 6120 &quot;Nashville,&quot; and the 6128 Duo Jet chambered &quot;solid body&quot;, which was played by Bo Diddley. Two other models were introduced - the Country Club, and the White Falcon.

In 1954, Webster suggested adding the sparkle finishes from Gretsch drums onto their guitars, resulting in the Gretsch Sparkle Jet. He was also inspired by the American cars of the era in introducing new finishes to their guitars.

During this time, Chet Atkins became an endorser of Gretsch and they sold guitars with Atkins&#x27; name on the pickguard. Atkins&#x27; endorsement, along with the use of Gretsch guitars by rock n roll artists such as Eddie Cochran and Duane Eddy, helped increase sales of Gretsch guitars.

After The Beatles first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show, Gretsch sales soared overnight, due to George Harrison playing a Gretsch Country Gentleman for the performance.

===Sale to Baldwin, Gretsch family regains interest===
Fred Gretsch never found a suitable successor, and in 1967 Gretsch was sold to Baldwin Pianos, becoming a subsidiary of that firm. Mid-1969, Baldwin moved Gretsch instrument manufacturing operations from Brooklyn to a plant in DeQueen, Arkansas.

In 1983, Baldwin&#x27;s holding company and several of its subsidiaries were forced into bankruptcy. At the time it was the largest bankruptcy ever, with a total debt of over $9 billion. In 1984, former Baldwin CEO Richard Harrison bought the Baldwin music divisions and brought back former Gretsch employee, Duke Kramer, to run the Gretsch division.

In 1985, the Gretsch company once again came under the leadership of the Gretsch family when Fred W. Gretsch, great-grandson of Friedrich and nephew of Fred Gretsch Jr, assumed presidency of the company. The first Gretsch guitars after Fred W Gretsch became president were released in 1988. They were a series of Traveling Wilburys commemorative guitars, which bore little resemblance to prior Gretsch models. In 1989, Gretsch restarted large-scale production of new guitars based on classic Gretsch models.

In 1999, the Bigsby Electric Guitars brand was sold to Gretsch. In 2019, Gretsch sold the Bigsby brand to Fender.

===Fender control===
In late 2002, Gretsch and the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation reached an agreement giving Fender control over marketing, production, and distribution of guitars, with the Gretsch family retaining ownership of the company.

<text>Marc Hempel (born May 25, 1957) is an American cartoonist/comics artist best known for his work on &quot;The Sandman&quot; with Neil Gaiman.

==Biography==
Writer and artist Marc Hempel grew up in the northwest suburbs of Chicago and now lives in Baltimore. He received a B.F.A. in Painting from Northern Illinois University in 1980. He and Mark Wheatley co-created the titles &quot;Breathtaker&quot;, &quot;Blood of the Innocent&quot;, and &quot;Mars&quot;. In 1994–1995, he collaborated with Neil Gaiman on the climactic story arc &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot; in &quot;The Sandman&quot;. Hempel&#x27;s own creations &quot;Gregory&quot; and &quot;Tug &amp; Buster&quot; were nominated for several industry awards, and his humor anthology &quot;Naked Brain&quot; was named &quot;Best Comic Book&quot; in the &quot;Baltimore City Paper&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Best of Baltimore 2003&quot; issue. His art has also appeared in &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot;, &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, &quot;Tarzan the Warrior&quot;, &quot;Clive Barker’s Hellraiser&quot;, &quot;Flinch&quot;, &quot;My Faith in Frankie&quot;, &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Lucifer&quot;, and &quot;Disney Adventures&quot;.

Original art from &quot;The Sandman&quot; and &quot;Breathtaker&quot; was included in an exhibition entitled &quot;LitGraphic: The World of the Graphic Novel,&quot; which originated at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.

Hempel has created advertising art for print and television as well as character design for HBO Animation. He has produced CD art for the Nashville band Swamp Rat, drawn an episode of the online strip &quot;Munden&#x27;s Bar&quot; for ComicMix.com, illustrated a 21–page &quot;Escapist&quot; story for Dark Horse Comics, and contributed to &quot;Mad&quot;, &quot;Nickelodeon Magazine&quot;, and &quot;SpongeBob Comics&quot;.

==Awards==
Marc Hempel received an Inkpot Award at San Diego Comic-Con in 1992.
